0,MartinHafer,Finally...a romance for REAL folks!,9,1 November 2014,"I love a good romantic movie. However, I have noticed that most of these films feature extremely young folks. Because of this, the covert message is that older people are not sexual or don't really matter! It's only s REAL romance when the actors are young and hot....or so you might think. However, in ""Something's Gotta Give"", you have a film featuring a woman in her 50s and a man in his 60s--not the sort of romantic leads you'd expect. And, it's simply a delight to watch.When the film begins, Harry (Jack Nicholson) is out chasing after a women who is about a third his age, Marin (Amanda Peet). However, this womanizing eternal bachelor is about to come into contact with Marin's mother, Erica (Diane Keaton) and for the first time in his life, he begins to have real feelings for a woman. Up until then, it was just a long series of shallow sexual relationships--in a sad attempt to prove his masculinity and protect himself from real intimacy. How all this works out is just something you'll have to see. Plus, with nearly 400 reviews for the film, it's probably not worth me repeating what others have said so many times already.The film works for me for two huge reason--the quality of the acting and the intelligence of the script. While Erica and Harry are NOT ordinary older folks (they are both wealthy and relatively famous characters), they represent interesting archetypes--the strong but lonely woman and the sad guy who doesn't realize just how lonely he really is. Most importantly, however, the writing is so good that you believe such a relationship COULD happen--and it's not simply a formulaic film and the two behave in wonderful and unexpected ways when they realize they are in love. Well worth seeing and a great date night film for any age group--but which will probably be appreciated more by an older audience. At 50, this sort of flick is just what I was looking for!",Something's Gotta Give
1,TheLittleSongbird,Entertaining romantic comedy that was much better than expected.,7,10 September 2009,"This movie was very entertaining and enjoyable. Yes I do admit it does have its problems- it is overlong, the ending was rather abrupt and the film does have some very predictable moments. But what does compensate are the performances of the two leads Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaten, and there are some very funny moments, such as Harry being rushed to hospital about three times, although two of those times was a sign that he had fallen in love, and when Harry catches Erica walking around the house naked. Though my favourite is when Harry is standing at the foot of a flight of stairs and wondering should I go up them? Of course Nicolson has been better, but Keaten was at her loveliest she really shone here, and there is great support from Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, and Keanu Reeves is actually tolerable here in a less flashy role. There is a well crafted script and some nice photography and music. Overall, has its flaws, but manages to be an engaging romantic comedy. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Something's Gotta Give
2,bkoganbing,"""An Intractable Heart Such As Mine""",8,25 June 2016,"My major disappointment with Something's Gotta Give is not hearing a single note of Johnny Mercer's famous standard in a film with that title and having an extensive music score. I'm sure there's a story why that didn't happen. Other than that this is one sleek romantic comedy about some older people finding true love.For Diane Keaton she's kind of wrapped herself in her work and her reputation as America's leading female playwright since Lillian Hellman. Her daughter Amanda Peet however is dating 60 something Jack Nicholson a record industry mogul. Nicholson is a compulsive womanizer and Peet is the latest in a long line of trophy beauties. This man has something to prove.But at their summer beach house Nicholson suffers some cardiac arrest and he's bound there while he mends. And of course Nicholson discovers that an intelligent woman close to his own age might actually have something to offer. Because 30 something doctor Keanu Reeves who is treating Nicholson finds Keaton most intriguing. In fact I've never seen Keanu Reeves more romantic on the screen.I'm older than all the principal characters in this film and I'm always glad to see films like Something's Gotta Give for us senior citizens showing that even if we have to take it easy we can still enjoy life and all it has to offer.If you're in my age bracket, don't miss this one.",Something's Gotta Give
3,SnoopyStyle,rom-com for the older set,6,21 December 2013,"Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) is always dating young girls. His latest girlfriend is Marin (Amanda Peet). It gets weird when they go to her mother Erica Barry (Diane Keaton)'s beach house, and they run into Erica and her sister who are about his age. Later, he has a heart attack. He's forced to stay at the beach house. And a love quadrangle develop between the three and emergency Dr Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves).Jack Nicholson isn't very likable to start off with. Diane Keaton is a bit annoying too. From the set up, they obviously have to get together. This is Nancy Meyers ranting about older woman being left behind as older man only have eyes for young hot things. The obvious movie set up of all those young things at the beginning of the movie really subtracts from the story. Once the movie starts off with the premise, it can't really go back to just a nice little story. It has to make a point.There are good actors here doing some good work, well maybe everybody except Keanu Reeves. Diane Keaton does go overboard with the screaming, the crying, and the overacting. I didn't find it funny as much as annoying. However, the story has enough sentimentalism to make it work. And what we get is a functional rom-com for the older set.",Something's Gotta Give
4,claudio_carvalho,Typical Hollywood Product,7,21 April 2005,"Harry Sandborn (Jack Nicholson) is a rich owner of a hip-hop label-record among dozen of other companies, who never dates a woman over thirty. While spending the weekend with Marion (Amanda Peet) in their seaside house, her mother, the successful writer Erica Barry (Diane Keaton), and her aunt Zoe Barry (Frances McDormand) unexpectedly arrive, and Harry has the beginning of a heart attack. Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) attends him and suggests he stays in the house, since it is nearby the hospital and his state needs some medical care. While staying with Erica, many romantic situation happens until a predictable end. ""Something's Gotta Give"" is a typical Hollywood product: good actors and actresses, predictable and fancy story, everybody is rich, successful, famous and charming etc. etc. etc. I did not dislike this movie, there are many good and funny moments, but I prefer an European or an independent romantic comedy instead. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Alguém Tem Que Ceder"" (""Someone Has to Yield"")",Something's Gotta Give
5,classicsoncall,"""Your heart attack could be the best thing that ever happened to me.""",7,27 November 2019,"Whenever I see a movie similar to this, I often wonder how the principal actors in the story react to issues in their own life that they're representing on screen. Like Jack Nicholson here, sixty six years old when he made the movie, portraying a sixty three year old playboy who has a penchant for loving 'em and leaving 'em, as long as his girlfriends are under the age of thirty. Do the same thoughts of mortality and finding true love in one's life go through his mind in a way of life imitating art? The same can be said of Diane Keaton as well, about a decade younger than Nicholson but still dealing with the issue of aging in an industry that values youth and beauty. Well, I guess we'll never know unless they come right out and say it.Enough philosophizing I guess. I thought this was a fairly good look at the foibles inherent in a relationship about to happen between a couple of characters who have a sense that the clock is ticking. Nicholson does a splendid job, but I have to say, Keaton is amazing with her facial expressions and reaction to situations at any given moment. The only time I thought she might have been forcing her emotions were in that writing scene right after Harry Sanborn (Nicholson) says goodbye to go back to New York. The alternately hysterical bouts of laughing and wailing came across as somewhat theatrical, but giving her the benefit of the doubt, added to the conflicted aspect of her character.Say, keep an eye on Nicholson right after he's treated for his first heart attack and gets out of his hospital bed. It seemed to me he was channeling R.P. McMurphy, the character he portrayed in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", right after getting the electroshock treatments. That was a neat homage if in fact it was intentional.The resolution to the story was to be expected, though I did find it difficult to accept that Dr. Mercer (Keanu Reeves) gave up his engagement to Erica Barry (Keaton) without much of a struggle. That happened off screen so there's not much opportunity to think about it at the time, but it was another one of those things I wonder about after a picture is over.",Something's Gotta Give
6,moonspinner55,"Smarmy, inverted misogyny",3,15 October 2007,"An excruciating set-up: a celebrated female playwright, who's been writing romantic scenes for years but who hasn't kissed a man in a decade, falls for an affable but unfaithful playboy/music-executive; both learn a little something about love-in-the-later-years. After opening with a highly-contrived and awkward set of circumstances, it is nearly amazing that ""Something's Gotta Give"" does have something to offer (though it is slight). Diane Keaton shines as the writer and Jack Nicholson has a few strong scenes as her love interest. Despite the fact the screenplay is both formulaic and boorish, these talented leads make the romantic scenes fairly lively and engaging. Keaton's character isn't completely resolved however, and when she complains about misogyny it doesn't quite wash (especially when her next Broadway triumph includes a comedic jab at inadvertently seeing Nicholson's rear-end--but nothing about him catching her in the buff). Could it be that misogyny is a two way street? *1/2 from ****",Something's Gotta Give
7,blanche-2,solid fun,8,2 May 2005,"This is a delightful tale of a divorced woman, her daughter, and the nutty ""older"" man who invades their lives with his illness and neuroses. This is a class act of a comedy in the hands of two real masters, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, beautifully supported by Amada Peet, Frances McDormand, and the ever-handsome Keanu Reeves.Keaton once again proves she is one of our greatest actresses, playing a successful playwright who, somewhere along the line, forgot about love and romance while living in high style in the Hamptons and New York City. Then her beautiful young daughter brings home a 63-year-old commitmentaphobe and the fun begins. And it is fun. Keaton has a glorious crying scene that should have won her an Oscar. Her timing is impeccable.Frances McDormand is one of my favorite actresses and, though I enjoyed her as Keaton's sister, the role seemed small and inconsequential for a woman of her enormous talents. My only other complaint about the film is that I think 15 minutes could have been easily cut. It went on a little too long.These are minor complaints. As a baby boomer, I love seeing women over 50 in lead roles and, as an adult, it's great to see a sophisticated, funny story for a change.",Something's Gotta Give
8,Quinoa1984,"Held my attention, had some good laughs and decent performances, though it can't hold a candle to As Good As It Gets",6,4 January 2004,"I saw first saw Something's Gotta Give, the new film by Nancy Meyes and starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, a month ago.  I wasn't sure whether I liked it, or though it was so-so, or even thought it was a drop off from the work I've seen Nicholson do lately (The Pledge and About Schmidt are wonderful works for the legend).  I saw it again tonight and I think I feel slightly different about it now.  It's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't watch it in a theater again, and I might flip around when it comes on TV to see the good scenes.  It's the kind of romantic comedy that suffers from a couple of downers, and yet there is a charm to it that should appeal to fans of the actors, and to older audiences (as I suspected over half of the audience was over the age of 50).  The good that's in the movie is that it's a sort of standard Hollywood-style story that doesn't go into rotten territory like other romantic comedies do. Nicholson plays a version of himself (a version of the truth?) as Harry, a record company executive who's dating a woman half his age (Amanda Peet). While staying at her mother's house at the Hamptons he meets both her playwright mother Erica (Keaton) and teacher aunt (Frances McDormand). Then, he gets hit with a heart attack, and is told by the doctor (Keanu Reeves) to stick around as to not get overly tensed by what he's struck down with.  Then the sparks being to come up between Harry and Erica when they're left to themselves while Harry recovers.  The things that make the film work are that Nicholson and Keaton have a nice connection to each other, like one of those old Hollywood star-couples in the old-time Hollywood movies.  I could've imagined the Harry role played by someone else, and maybe for Keaton too, but the way it turned out it's about right as a stars' vehicle.  And there are plenty of laughs that come up involving Nicholson after the heart attack (the biggest for me came minutes after his first heart attack, when he tries to walk around), and with consistent sexual puns and wit.  What didn't work for me was the Hollywood-style romanticism and direction the sob parts of the story and characters went to that were much, much better under the control of someone like James L. Brooks in the classic As Good As It Gets.  In that film Nicholson played a version of himself, too, but that character and story had an edge to it all that could make it totally re-watchable for women as well as men.  As for Keaton, she holds her own quite well next to her counter-part, and she looks terrific, though for some reason seeing what the script required her to do in a role like this makes me really want to see her in a Woody Allen flick again.  The acting by Reeves was another glaring flaw, reminding me that he's much better off in Matrix and action-film land than here- every time he had a romantic moment I cringed in my seat.  There were also supporting roles by Peet and McDormand that were under-used. 
Still, I do sorta, kinda recommend Something's Gotta Give- it has humor that isn't too raunchy (unless you get offended by heart-attack and viagra jokes), and as a chick flick it does fine.  In some ways it could've been better, and in other ways there was no way it could've tried for better ground, and there were some touches that made it tolerable and watchable.

9,ComedyFan2010,It is incredible that this movie could be so bad,3,26 June 2012,"Harry is an older rich man who never dated a woman over 30. After suffering a heart attack when staying at the house of his recent girlfriend, Marin, he starts having feelings for her mother Erica. This is the short synopsis of this movie. It actually is a great idea. Nothing over the top original, but in our time when women over 40 are considered sexless and are usually not the main characters in romantic movies it is a refreshing change.Take the story and add the remarkable cast: Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand. One would think that this movie would be absolutely outstanding, right? Unfortunately this is not the case.How was it possible to take all those positive factors and turn into this irritating and boring movie? First of all, it just doesn't make sense. No, no, I am not saying that it is unrealistic for a man to fall in love with a woman who is closer to his age or that a man can't fall in love with a woman 15 years older than him. This can happen and it does happen. But why did any of this particular people fall in love with each other? I understand that Dr. Mercer is a fan of Erica's work but this alone isn't a good reason to be in love. Nothing happened between them that would make me think ""ah, I see!"". Same goes for Harry and Erica. And I mean it both ways. It is especially hard for me to understand why a woman like Erica would go after a man like Harry. Why would she choose him over Dr. Mercer? Here is a guy who cares for her but instead she wants to be with a man who is incapable of relationships. Is it because he is so great at messaging her online? I didn't see any reason of why she would feel such a strong connection to him. Of course it is just a romantic comedy, no need to expect it being too deep, but if it went on and on for two hours I would hope to at least see the reason behind her actions.Erica's character is pretty horribly done. She doesn't seem like a woman falling in love but more like a teenager. I am not saying that women in their 50's can't have the great feeling of love. Of course they do, it can go on until we die. But her character seems to be completely incapable of handling it. It is as if she has no life and experience whatsoever. Her being all hysterical, rambling and going crazy seems to only be possible if one is 13 and has never felt love, heard of love or has no understanding of human emotions or even of her own. Her crying scenes irritate me, the scenes where she talks about loves make me cringe. It is a horribly developed character and a badly written dialogue.I also have no clue how Diane Keaton got a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for this. There is no arguing that she is a remarkable actress with a big number of great performances under her belt, but this sure wasn't one of them.Frances McDormant did a good job, luckily for her she only had a few short scenes. And she did them well, especially the one where she basically tells us all the message of the movie.Jack Nicholson was just playing himself.Amanda Peet's character is also useless. She keeps on telling us all why she isn't having relationships as if she already has figured it all out after some therapy. And then listening to her mom's tearful nonsense ramblings she suddenly starts also acting like that. Silly!The only good thing were the scenes of Erica's play. With a bunch of Harrys dancing on the strange with their naked bums. I also applaud Diane Keaton for her naked scene, especially since she has a great body that many women 20 years younger than her would be jealous of.This movie had potential. It is nice to have love stories with characters over 40 because these people still exist as well, but what is not nice is to simply take a teenage love story and cast people over 50 into it because it is not believable nor worth watching, for any age group.",Something's Gotta Give
10,edwagreen,Something Good Gave in this One ***1/2,9,29 August 2013,"Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton provide the perfect chemistry in this off-beat 2003 romantic comedy. Nicholson shows all of the charm as a playboy with a penchant for younger women; this time, it's Amanda Peet, Keaton's daughter in the film. When they all show up at Keaton's Hampton's summer home, the fun starts-especially when Nicholson is felled by a coronary and forced to stay at the Keaton residence.Keaton does well playing that upper-class playwright, emotionally involved in her work, and not ready for romance after her 20 marriage goes southward.How Nicholson and Keaton fall in love in the real fun part to watch this joyous film.Keanu Reeves is great as the debonair 36 year old physician treating Nicholson. He loves Keaton's work and tries to take full advantage of that in making a relationship with Diane.Enjoyable, steady-paced comedy; an absolute pleasure to watch.",Something's Gotta Give
11,Coventry,"Old, sappy romance.",5,8 March 2004,"Romantic comedies aren't really my favorite films to watch and I always hated Diane Keaton. Reason for that is her starring in too many crappy Woody Allen movies (go figure how much I hate Mia Farrow) So, the only reason why I went to see Something's Gotta Give is the presence of Jack Nicholson.the only actor now who deserves to be called 'a living legend'. And I'm surprisingly glad that I spent money on this film. it delivers exactly what you expect: a few good laughs and terrific charismatic performances, especially by Jack Nicholson who more or less plays himself here. Something's Gotta Give is your usual and predictable feel-good story, only the protagonists are 30 years older than usual. The whole process of Nicholson and Keaton falling in love contains several funny situations and highlights. After that, it turns into an even more typical mix of sentimental mumbo-jumbo, semi-drama twists and desperate attempts to make you cry. The whole film lasts way too long and the forced happy-end is hard to swallow but, you know, it's inevitable. This film made me appreciate Diane Keaton a little more but still, she overacts terribly.which is probably why she received an Oscar nomination for it. The most convincing pro-elements are Jack Nicholson, several adorable side-characters (like Frances McDormand, Rachel Ticotin and Jon Favreau) and the irresistible soundtrack that contains multiple French golden oldies.
You've seen it all before, but who cares. Surprise your girlfriend (or your wife) by taking her to see this film and she'll love you forever. More critical and sarcastic men can amuse themselves by paying extra attention to the funny one-liners Jack Nicholson has.like: `Schmucks are people too!'",Something's Gotta Give
12,sunwarrior13,A Middle-Age Romance Film,9,1 October 2012,"Something's Gotta Give is a romantic comedy film that features Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton as a successful 60-something and 50- something, who find love for each other at a different time of life, despite being complete opposites. Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet co-star, with Frances McDormand, Paul Michael Glaser, Jon Favreau and KaDee Strickland playing key supporting roles.It was written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. Harry Langer is a swinging sixty-something entertainment executive that is surrounded by plenty of young girlfriends. His latest romance is young petite sophisticate Marin, who takes him to her mother's beach house in the Hamptons for a weekend fling. However, Marin's successful Broadway playwright mother Erica Barry is already vacationing at the house with her sister Zoe. Marin and Harry stay anyway, and Harry ends up having a heart attack. He goes to the hospital and is looked after by thirty-something doctor Julian Mercer. Impressed by her writing, Dr. Mercer finds himself pursuing a romance with Erica. Because of his serious health condition, he orders Harry to stay near the hospital. While Marin returns to Manhattan, Erica agrees to stay on and look after Harry. Of course they are repulsed by each other at first, but they end up falling in love throughout the recovery process.A comedy of manners with two of the most mannered movie stars of our time, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, acting all over the place until you surrender with the ecstasy of pure pleasure.The moments between the characters are absolutely full. It's a pleasure to watch such consummate professionals.It's definitely an entertaining movie.",Something's Gotta Give
13,jotix100,Jack's derriere,8,14 December 2003,"For all the hype surrounding this film we were expecting a terrific picture. Well, this comedy feels empty, somehow. Don't get me wrong, but these characters just don't make sense. Why if they are supposed to be Jewish, they are presented in the screen as typical WASPs? The dialogue has enough ""boobies"" in it, but it contains no chutzpah at all! Nancy Meyers is a talented writer, as well as a director. There is no doubt she had very good intentions about this film. Ms Meyers has worked with Diane Keaton before, so there was no problem there. My perception is that Jack Nicholson is terribly wrong for the part he is playing. That undoes whatever positive vibe Ms Meyers had on the material. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton show no liking for one another, or is it perhaps that Jack's character is not simpatico enough?On the other hand, could it be that Diane Keaton has been playing this woman all her life and we just don't care? Jack's is not nasty enough to hold our interest. We just don't believe for a moment that this man could be the playboy he is supposed to represent. Frances McDormand as Diane Keaton's sister has nothing to do in the film. Also Amanda Peet. It's incomprehensible how Amanda could date and un-date Jack Nicholson at the drop of a blouse, or a bra. How about that she ends up as a probably ultra orthodox Manhattan's West Sider with probably a dentist, or perhaps a lawyer? Keanu Reeves' would have been a better choice for Diane, at least he didn't need Viagra to perform in the sack, and they could always had Paris!The film is mildly funny at moments, but it certainly doesn't ring true at all.",Something's Gotta Give

Harry wants to leave the hospital--but the doctor will only let him go if he stays a week at Erica's beach house. Erica hates Harry, but agrees. Naturally they become attracted to each other...but the doctor is also attracted to Erica. Sometimes hilarious and romantic complications ensue.Fantastic! A Hollywood movie celebrating middle-aged romance! It was a pleasure seeing Nicholson make fun of his own image with Peet and romancing a woman close to her age. Him and Keaton play off each other wonderfully and there scenes are beautifully romantic and VERY sexy--proving we DON'T need young people always going at it. Also it was very refreshing to see a younger man madly in love with Keaton. The script is sharp and funny and the movie is beautifully filmed.Nicholson is just great. He tones down his mannerisms and plays the role quietly and intelligently. Keaton is superb (she HAS to get an Oscar nomination for this!). She looks great--lines and all--her comic timing is (as always) perfect and she's so radiant and full of life--Reeves attraction makes sense! Reeves is his usual blank self (no expression, no acting) but he actually comes across as somewhat charming in his scenes with Keaton. Peet is wasted in her small role as is Jon Farveau. But it WAS great to see Rachel Ticotin in her small but fun role as a nurse.The movie has problems--it's WAY too long (there are at least 5 times I thought it was ending) and I HATED the ending. I won't give it away but Keaton ended up with the wrong guy! It's a quick turn around at the end that I just couldn't swallow. That just stopped me from giving it a 10--I'm giving it a 9.It's great that this movie is doing so well!

Diane Keaton gives a deft comedic performance, and she as an actress is so likable that whether or not her character is deserving of our sympathy is beside the point. She and Jack Nicholson have a lot of chemistry together, as do she and Keanu Reeves, who plays a young doctor with whom she strikes up a romance.Like every Nancy Myers movie, this one also seems to think that naked middle-aged people are the height of comedy.Grade: B-",Something's Gotta Give

18,anaconda-40658,Nicholson's Gotta Give.,6,15 March 2016,"Something's Gotta Give (2003): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Amanda Peet, Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand: Amusing romantic comedy about relationships and commitment. Jack Nicholson stars as an ageing playboy who travels with his much younger girlfriend to a beach resort where her mother interrupts their romancing. After a sudden heart condition he is cared for by his girlfriend's mother. The film teases viewers with romance and denials allowing soul seeking resolutions. Directed by Nancy Meyers who previously made a similar film called What Women Want. Her films often regard relationship functions and what makes us tick and how others will react. Fine chemistry between Nicholson and Diane Keaton that boarders on shyness and resentment. This is overly predictable but both leads have charm and likable comic disposition that works. Amanda Peet is underwritten as Keaton's daughter who just disappears through most of the film and shows up when convenient. Keanu Reeves plays Nicholson's doctor who attempts a romance with Keaton. It plays as an opposite to Nicholson's romance to the much younger Peet with age difference coming into play. Frances McDormand plays Keaton's sister and the role is beneath what she is capable of.

19,Wuchakk,That Hamptons episode,7,16 August 2020,"A lifelong 'ladies man' (Jack Nicholson) used to dating young women has a life-altering experience while staying at the manor of a playwright (Diane Keaton) in the Hamptons. Amanda Peet plays the latter's daughter, Frances McDormand her sister and Keanu Reeves a local doctor.Written & directed by Nancy Meyer, ""Something's Gotta Give"" (2003) is an amusing romcom that addresses the theme of dating people well younger than yourself vs. dating people closer to your own age, as well as epiphanies and finding your true love or soulmate. While there's a little nudity done for laughs, it lacks the sleazy/bathroom humor of romcoms that would've been superior if they didn't stoop to that low level of non-humor, like ""She's Out of My League"" (2010).The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot at The Hamptons, Long Island & New York City; Warner Brothers Burbank Studios & Santa Monica, CA; and Paris, France.GRADE: B",Something's Gotta Give
20,zetes,Funny and sophisticated,9,3 April 2004,"It just goes to show you, you never know what you're going to like. I must have stopped at the video store a hundred times before I finally was able to get 21 Grams, and I was quite disappointed by it. I had little to no desire to see Something's Gotta Give, but my sister-in-law rented it and I'll watch just about anything - and I absolutely loved it! It completely swept me off my feet. It's a romantic comedy that is perfect in both those aspects. It's classy and well written, which are two things that you hardly ever get in movies nowadays. Diane Keaton is tremendous, and I thought even Jack Nicholson, whom I've been getting tired of for quite a long time now, was top notch. I'd have rather seen him get an Oscar nomination for this than any of the past four or five films he's been nominated for. Amanda Peet and Frances MacDormand are also great, though I wish the latter had had more screen time (as it is, it's long, but this is the kind of movie I could have spent more time with). The only misfire in the casting is Keanu Reeves, who, as much as I love Bill & Ted, proves once again that he's one of the worst actors who has ever appeared on celluloid. I was laughing and smiling every minute of the movie, and I was genuinely touched by the relationship that develops between Keaton and Nicholson. Of course it has its share of clichés, but it works them in ways that aren't especially predictable. Something's Gotta Give is an utter delight, one that I'll surely enjoy again in the future. 9/10.",Something's Gotta Give

The great scenes on the beach at the Hampton's on Long Island, N.Y. gave the film a great deal of depth.  Jack Nicholson,(Harry Sanborn),""The Postman Always Rings Twice"",'81, played a role very much like himself in real life and gave an outstanding supportive role through out the entire picture.  There were lots of laughs with Harry showing his rear end in the hospitals which he seemed to visit quite often.  Diane Keaton,(Erica Barry),""The First Wives Club"",'96, put all her great acting skills into her role in this film which made it a wonderful and delightful viewing experience.  Harry and Erica meet in Paris, France which keeps the audience spellbound as to what will finally happen to these two so called ""Senior Citizens"".  Frances McDormand,(Zoe Barry), ""City by the Sea"",'02, also added great skillful acting in her supportive role. This film offered lots of laughs and plenty of fun to watch!",Something's Gotta Give

Also, in Hollywood today, we have so many love stories with younger and just drop dead gorgeous actors that make it so unreal and is not helping in the convincing state of that love can be sweet, painful, but nevertheless everlasting.""Something's Gotta Give"" breaks all the rules and finally a movie I felt in some ways was more true than movies like ""The Notebook"", ""Tristan and Isolade"", or ""Hitch"". In the movie we have Jack Nicholson playing a life long bachelor who chases only the younger women(far stretch, huh?) and he dates Dianne Keaton's daughter, when he has a heart attack, he stays with Dianne to be close to the hospital for care. In the process these two who are in their 60's manage to find love again, proving that still after so many years that it is still possible to get your heart broken and mended again.This is such a lovely story and does not deserve in no way of a 6.8!

On the upside there's Keaton's wonderful performance to good old Jack in the only comedy persona in his repertoire to a solid supporting cast and good production value, etc. On the downside, the film distills to two hours of the same old stuff we've all seen before. From the open back of the hospital gown to the ""Oop's, you're naked"" scene to the Viagra jokes, the humor in this romcom for ""baby boomers"" is chock full of uninspired recycled humor. Nonetheless,  the film got respectable marks from all corners and makes for a worthwhile three star watch for anyone into senior romantic comedy fare. (B)",Something's Gotta Give

26,cherold,"Decent, but not great",6,24 October 2004,"Nancy Meyer's is very good at creating modern fairy tales for women. There was Private Benjamin, in which a spoiled ditz gets herself together to become a superwoman, Baby Boom, which suggests that really, the modern woman can have it all on her own terms, and now, Something's Gotta Give, which tells us that a smart, older woman can be as sexy as a simple-minded young one. Of the three movies, this is the weakest, but over all it's pretty enjoyable. There is good chemistry between Nicholson and Keaton, even though they look like their clenching their jaws when they kiss, and much of the movie's first hour or so is very funny. But the movie begins to run out of steam in the second half as more attention is payed to character growth then getting some good jokes in, and while Meyer's movies tend to have pat and predictable endings, they generally work better on their own terms than this one, which feels false and formulaic. Still, worth watching for the stars, who bury their bland co-stars in the dust and essentially make this a two-character movie with some cardboard cut-outs to talk to.",Something's Gotta Give
27,theowinthrop,Two Romantics Coming Of Age,10,9 March 2008,"This film may become recalled for the wrong reason: it is the movie where a middle aged Diane Keaton was shown naked for a moment, and we saw Jack Nicholson's tush for a few seconds while he wondered in a drugged state in a hospital.It's better than those two cute scenes. This film is an example of Hollywood remembering that sexual life does not end at age 45 but continues until one or both partners is physically incapable of doing much (and even then it may not conclude). Jack Nicholson is a very successful bachelor (age 63) with a long list of sexual conquests. He is currently going out to the Hamptons with Amanda Peet, a mid twentyish beauty, who appreciates Nicholson's worldly nature and intelligence. As she later says to her mother (Diane Keaton) Nicholson is a lot of fun to be with. They end up at Keaton's magnificent home in the Hamptons only to find she is there with her sister Frances McDormand. A bit uncertain about the situation, Nicholson suggests he return to New York City and he'll catch up with Peet at some other time. But McDormand suggests they are all adults so they should be able to share the large house for the weekend. This is accepted by Keaton and Nicholson, although both have their doubts.Those doubts are highlighted at dinner that night - Nicholson is well known for his financial success (he is involved in ten corporations, including a Hip-Hop record label), and has been the subject of a serious article in a magazine. Keaton is a highly successful dramatist. McDermand (a teacher of sociology subjects such as feminism) steers the conversation around to the Nicholson's feelings about non-commitment to marriage. Nicholson is revealing - to revealing as he accidentally uses phrases like, ""women of your age"" when addressing Keaton (who we later learn is 56). She bristles because (as McDermand points out) a man who is unmarried at 63 is admired for being so hard to catch, whereas a woman unmarried at that date is an ""old maid"".Shortly afterward Nicholson has a heart attack - he's rushed to the hospital and Keanu Reeves takes care of him (after first giving Jack a scare about a nitroglycerin drip and possible reactions with Viagra). Jack had a mild attack but needs a week or recuperation - and the only place is Keaton's home. McDermand and Peet leave for the city, and Keaton tries to concentrate on a play she is supposed to be completing. But she and Nicholson, despite initial hostility, are finding each other rather compatible. But Keaton is also aware of Reeves' interest in her, and dates him too.The gradual realization that he and Keaton share much more than the average girl he's dated hits Nicholson in their days together, and also hits Keaton. Eventually they do find they like having sex together. There is just one fly in the ointment - Nicholson can't bring himself from polygamous satyr into monogamous middle age. He can't commit, and Keaton is driven to distraction to this. The only good that comes out of it is it influences her writing: her new play is an artistic success that to Nicholson's dismay pillories his fictitious counterpart. She even lets the fictitious counterpart die of a heart attack in the play!Do our middle aged romantics unite, or is Keanu the man for Diane while Nicholson continues his string of female conquests? The resolution is touching and sensible. The acting is first rate, as all the characters play people with real personalities (if upper middle class personalities) for a change. I also commend the cinematography from the shots of the beaches of Long Island's south shore to a magnificent shot of Nicholson, dressed to the nines, with the Eiffel Tower alight in the background. As an adult, modern romantic comedy SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE can rarely be matched.",Something's Gotta Give
28,ElMaruecan82,When Harry Met Annie (Hall)...,8,22 November 2020,"If anything, ""Something's Gotta Give"" reminded me of how precious to American cinema Diane Keaton is and how underused her talent was. She exuded these sweet and positive vibes like her heiresses Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts did and that made them ideal casts for romantic comedies.Woody Allen knew she had the kind of quirky gentleness and unpretentious wit that made her the perfect counterpart to his more tormented and neurotic characters. And one quality she embodied better than any other actress was her accessibility: whether she played girls next door or intellectuals, you could always reach her without having to feign your emotions (no wonder it couldn't work with a hardened heart such as Michael Corleone's).That 'accessibility' thing is smartly explored in Nancy Meyers's 2003 rom-com about two aging persons who find each other after years of wandering in the certitude that true love existed for a category of persons they didn't belong to.The man is Harry Sanborn, a music mogul in his early sixties, who made a forty-year speciality of dating girls who could be his daughters, reminding me of the infamous ""Dazed and Confused"" quotes about high school girls. I guess Harry enjoyed that young girls would stay the same age while his experience and wealth could only enhance his seduction skills. That philosophy backfires when he realizes through a heart attack that one element doesn't improve with age.The woman is Erica Barry, a divorced playwright who lives in a luxuruous mansion, dedicating her time to her work and injecting her reveries into stories rather than dreaming of the Charming Prince. Age didn't filter her beauty, she has a catchy smile and her eyes have a sweet wide expression that shows her eternal disposition to listen and care for people... not to mention that it's part of her job: anything from her human peers can bring new elements of inspiration in her stories. So when she catches her daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) with Harry, her shock doesn't last and she ends up accepting it, probably hanging on the certitude that it's just a phase.Although not as present in the film as I would have expected, Erica's sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) seizes the opportunity of a dinner to criticize the inequality between men and women: a longtime celibate becomes a seducer while a woman can only turn into a reclusive spinster. This is the only bit of a social comment in a film whose main concern is to show that the laws of attraction -as unpredictable as they are- still follow traditional patterns: it's all about finding yourself comfortable with the other.So when Harry has his heart attack, he's literally contradicting Zoe's point by showing one inequality which is that men's health is more fragile and maybe their thriving for sex is only a desperate attempt to explore their manliness for as long as they can. So it's not really a ""man vs. woman"" thing but a matter of timing. And the timing must move on and the 'heart' situation forces Harry to stay in Erica's house until he recovers (while Marin is absent). Naturally, he learns to appreciate a woman in his age range, one he doesn't need to pretend to be someone else, one who accepts his fragilities and allows him not to play a role.Humbled by Erica's open-mindedness, Harry discovers a sensitivity and a need for love he was too busy to ever suspect. In a way his character reminded me of Melvin Ulich in ""As Good at it Gets"" and the way he wanted to ""become a better man"" at Helen Hunt's contact. ""Something Gotta Give"" allows Jack Nicholson to delivers one of these performances that doesn't rely on his eyebrow-raising snarks and like in ""About Schmidt"", Nicholson knows how to unveil his inner vulnerability while sticking to his cocky and not-instantly-likable persona, it's less to sink into pathos than to make the complementarity with Keaton believable.And the chemistry between the two actors is so irresistible that I felt a great deal of frustration when he didn't have the courage to settle down and got back to his old habits. But it's a foregone conclusion that Harry and Erica will end up together so what matter are the journeys that would lead each one to that realization, fittingly set in the most romantic city in the world.Which leads me to perhaps the one little weakness in that good film; Julian, Keanu Reeves character, who's just too ideal for words: he's a doctor, he's handsome and he's Erica Barry's number one fan. But he's annoyingly underwritten and the way he never really grasps that he's just an object of curiosity is infuriating, but I didn't think the character of Marin was that three-dimensional either, she's more a foil to her mother who understands through her the danger of cynicism and the charm of being romantic. Maybe a trick that could have worked was to connect Julian and Marin together but that would have been too predictable and contrived for a film that is closer to Nora Ephron than Woody Allen (in spirit).The real merit of ""Something's Gotta Give"" is to give a wonderful role to Diane Keaton (and her last Oscar-nominated one) with a character that doesn't just shine for her intelligence and gentleness but also her sexiness. Even Woody Allen didn't dare to expose her like this film did and it's a credit to Meyers to show Keaton in a way we never saw her before. Besides, the the 'nude' scene shows perhaps another inequality between men and women. When Harry's butt appears, it's played for laughs, when we see Erica's body, it's not just a comic shock; through her body we have a glimpse on her physical starvation, it's less the body than its needs. And through the contact with her body, Harry will reach her heart.I guess women and men don't work that differently after all.",Something's Gotta Give
29,dromasca,"Good acting, but not much more",7,6 April 2004,"'Something...' is the kind of movies that Hollywood loves to make. They seem to be taken directly from  some Broadway plays, deal with the New York bourgeois characters and their little aging, sex, emotional or relationship problems, in a manner that seems to be somehow outdated in the 21th century world. This is escapist entertainment, and there is nothing wrong with it - as long as you do not pretend that cinema art stops here.This specific movie lives well on the acting of its two great lead stars. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton do not do the roles of their careers here, but they are good and funny, in the limits of the script. The problem is that the script is that predictable and the way the problems of love, aging, and age gap love are treated in such a conventional manner that not much is left but plastic quality emotions, and some smile-but-not-really-laugh humor. Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves appear in sex-symbols supporting roles, and it's a waste of their talents. Maybe the producers should do some day the romantic comedy staring the two, there is potential here!

31,secondtake,"If not stunning or brilliant, it's solid and very very feel good. So feel good.",7,25 April 2013,"Something's Gotta Give (2003)There are two things recommending this film: Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. Alone and together they are funny and alive. You might expect their individual strengths, but they actually have chemistry, or at least rapport, on screen.The story is fun and funny and heartwarming, and you kind of know what's going to happen much of the time. And you want it to, so you get that confirmation and have fun watching the two be together (or not) as their relationship grows and changes. Director and writer Nancy Meyers is pretty straight forward here--and if she's no Nora Ephron (lacking finesse and wit at that level), she's got the right idea. You can picture a better film, smoother and more cinematic, under a different director (there are some clunky visual decisions if you are looking), but the story keeps it going.The rest of the cast? Mostly what you'd expect. Keanu Reeves is better than usual, playing an unplayed role nicely, and Frances McDormand is funny but a bit awkward here, as if miscast, or at odds with the director. Amanda Peet as the daughter is cheerful enough but I found her unconvincing in her role scooping up a rap record label womanizer (Nicholson) three times her age. It's the unlikeliness of the main match-up that makes the movie work, of course, and in a way they dive into their success too easily. (A screwball comedy would have sustained the tension until the last scene, and here they keep it in the air for about five minutes.) Of course, this is a standard romantic comedy, and the romance figures heavily. And there are turns in the feelgood plot that make it rise above. And make it worth watching twice, believe it or not, at least with a few years rest. The performances are what remain sparkling and new.You might have trouble, as I do every time I see this movie (and it's been a few times for some reason) with the last scene. It's meant to be sudden and dramatic, but the previous scene doesn't quite set things up that way. Sort of, but not quite, and the validity of the change of heart at the end is necessary. But then of course the snow falls and Paris is beautiful and life is beautiful and we all have hope. It's a feel good movie that really works.",Something's Gotta Give
32,leplatypus,Something gotta fail (dvd),1,29 December 2011,"I think it was good experience for Amanda to be near of those Hollywood stars but the movie by itself is behind its expectations.The idea to show romance at sixty is original but translated in Hollywood language, it's become dull and hollow : if we see their naked parts, the movie is too prude to show them actually having sex and above all, as usual in American comedies, the characters live in an ideal world, faraway of our daily lives : Nicholson is a rich music mogul and Keaton is a famous writer. Amanda works at Christies and Keanu is a doctor. Do they know about blue collars, secretary, getting up at 7 :00 for a 8 hours shift? The first part (the more interesting) happens in a sea mansion (funnily toured by Amanda in the extras) that the audience could never afford even after a entire life of work.So, in spite of some good lines, i got my usual reaction : What's the point ? How do they want me to be interested in the lives of such spoiled people ? The second part of the movie is the usual love/hate/rejoice path of any Hollywood romances so there's isn't any originality. The climax in Paris is laughable : we don't see the city that much and as usual, Hollywood reconstructs the reality : in no way, you have a luxurious hotel so close of the Eiffel Tower (I live there !). However, the choice of the City Hall bridge is a good one because i remember to have also shared a romantic moment there !

33,howard.schumann,Predictable but gotta love it,7,26 April 2004,"Something's Gotta Give, a star vehicle for Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, is the kind of unsurprising and predictable fare that critics like to trash but that audiences seem to love. It is indeed welcome to find a romantic comedy that at least acknowledges that those over fifty are still capable of lovemaking but the references to wrinkle creams and Viagra should have been left on the cutting room floor. Nicholson is terrific as usual as Harry Sanborn, a 63-year old recording company executive, who has a thing for younger women, and Diane Keaton is perfect as playwright Erica Barry, a divorcee who has avoided any entanglements since her marriage ended years ago. Harry is having a fling with auctioneer Marin (Amanda Peet) who likes older men, and they are starting to have some fun at their mother's lavish home until Erica shows up with her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) and the frolicking is put on hold. While in the middle of some over activity, Harry has a heart attack and Erica is forced to take care of him while he recuperates. Put off at first, her feelings change once she gets to know him. Meanwhile, Harry's doctor Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) whom he met during his short stay at the hospital begins to develop an interest in Erica and the plot goes through multiple sitcom-like starts and stops until it eventually decides on one of many possible endings.

This is one of the funniest, wittiest, most delightful scripts for a romantic comedy in recent years, and equally well directed. There are so many hilarious lines of dialogue to match the equally hilarious situations that this script should be used as a model in film schools to teach people how to make comedies. There are many of us out there who find Jack Nicholson pretty creepy, but all is forgiven in this film, where with the best of good humour he is more than willing to make fun of himself as the guy who's 'even a lech when he's unconscious'. What is more, we really believe him when he changes. If Nicholson had no sense of humour, he would be intolerable. But his humour must be the bedrock of his charm. So, to put it bluntly, he is damned brilliant in this film. Diane Keaton is sheer magic, Frances McDormand (everybody's favourite supporting actress) is as excellent as we would expect, but far sexier than usual, even twinkly and mischievous. It all works, works so well. Keanu Reeves has to be rather earnest and restrained in his part, and he judges it perfectly. This is true ensemble playing.

36,elshikh4,Sugar with honey can be a real bad mix !,2,25 August 2010,"A story about old people's love. Fine. 2 of the most important Hollywood actors. Nice. A delicate time till the assured happy ending. Cute. So why, for all time, I was about to EXPLODE?!Firstly, it's in the level of the characters. They're all rich people. Insanely rich at times. I mean how that writer has all of that ravishing home on the beach? Maybe I'm jealous, since I'm a full time writer myself, and I still don't have even a flat of my own yet. And how all the girls fall for that old playboy, just like that?? It's weird! Yet again, I don't have that ability, despite being way younger than him! So, the first block between me and the movie was personal.Let's get more objective. The movie looks glittering from the outside yet non-special. I didn't see a scene that dazzled or moved me. Everything is running smoothly on-screen. Too smoothly to be precise. The soft-colored sets, the soft image, and the soft music (which we heard in hundreds of movies before!) all of that made me feel soft in the head for watching this. Not to mention how that turned the whole thing into something so similar to a long commercial about happy old couples with some aphrodisiac, or living peacefully with good insurance company! It was glossy like empty crystal glass.Speaking about empty; some situations were so corny; like seeing the heroine undressed accidentally. Some were treated non-creatively; like when the lead finds himself in a play. And most of them were cold, with no sense of true love or pain to be felt. The ups and downs of the events were few and languid. And I wasn't satisfied with the problems' solutions, there were all easy, especially the one of the climax; she wrote a play about them, so he felt regretful, and they simply come together (??!!).To add even more fuel, it is hopelessly unfunny for all the time, unless you get happy out of seeing (Keaton) screaming non-stop! It missed the ""comedy"" in the romantic comedy. And let me declare it strongly; it's so predictable without seeing its trailer earlier, I guessed the whole story by seeing the first meeting between its 2 leads / the movie's second scene!Wanna one word to sum the matter up; It's Hollywood. Namely rich people, dreamy atmosphere, easy solutions, and then the happy end. Although that can be likable sometimes, but with regard to (Something's Gotta Give) it isn't. Putting sugar with honey isn't smartness at all. A bit of bitterness could have fixed the things to be deeply attractive and effective. Because despite dealing with old people this time, and having big actors, it ended up as silly, shallow and weak as any other chick flick with adolescent story and rookie cast.A sweet juice to entertain some old ladies. So sweet to a degree that ruins your appetite!",Something's Gotta Give
37,dfranzen70,Kids! Love nicely!,6,7 April 2004,"Romance among the AARP set in a movie is never an easy proposition, pardon the pun. The participants have to be sexy enough that the younger people in the audience don't get all grossed out (""Gramma and Granpa are KISSING!!! With tongue!!!!""), but not too sexy. The audience wants to be swept off its feet, but it doesn't want anything that's overly salacious.For the most part, writer-director Nancy Meyers succeeds here. Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry, a neurotic, highly successful playwright. Jack Nicholson plays himself. Okay, technically he plays 63-year-old Harry Sanborn, owner of a hip-hop record label and chronic womanizer.One of the funniest scenes in the movie comes right near the beginning. Harry's with his new squeeze Marin (Amanda Peet), at Marin's mom's house. There's Harry, in his boxers and a t-shirt, putting wine in the 'fridge, when Marin's mom - you guessed it, Erica - unexpectedly comes home. Naturally, she thinks he's an intruder and calls 911. I mean, wouldn't you? It takes some explaining, but soon the misunderstanding is cleared up and our combatants (oops, participants) can get on with the romancin'.The thrust of the story (oops, another pun) is that while fooling around with Marin upstairs, Harry suffers a heart attack. At the hospital, Dr. Mercer (an interestingly cast Keanu Reeves) admonishes the unrepentant Harry for overexerting himself and tells him not to travel for a little while. Yup, you guessed it, that means he has to bunk with Erica. And our romance is thus set up.The good news is that pairing Keaton and Nicholson (who appeared together in 1982's Reds) was a great, great idea. Keaton basically plays a grown-up Annie Hall, and she manages to look sexy and daffy at the same time. Nicholson, for all his bluster and creakiness, still has the panache that has served him so well for the past forty years or so.The trouble is that after their relationship is consummated, the two leads behave like seventh graders. Now, no offense to you seventh graders out there, but you do have a tendency to get melodramatic. Admit it. In this movie, Erica spends - no exaggeration here - a good ten minutes sobbing. And sobbing. And sobbing. Everywhere and anywhere. Yikes and double yikes. For his part, Harry broods like no one's ever brooded before, like he's up for an Olympic medal in the event of Feeling Bummed Out. After a while, you wish these two crazy kids would just get over it. Call her! Call him! Do something!To make matters worse for the relationship, Erica writes a play based on her experiences with Harry, complete with him dancing drunkenly in a hospital gown. Does this lady play hardball, or what?Granted, the storyline is predictable, but the two leads are wonderful, and very well cast. Meyers wrote the script with Keaton and Nicholson in mind specifically, the decision was a wise one.Something's Gotta Give has a funny beginning and a sweet ending, but the middle suffers from an unfortunate lag.",Something's Gotta Give
38,PWNYCNY,Good movie.,8,2 September 2006,"This movie is a drama about a man and a woman who erect an elaborate array of emotional barriers to fend away intimacy and thereby avoid pain. They want intimacy, they want romance, they want love, and do not want to be alone, but are afraid of letting down their defenses and getting hurt and having to get in touch with a lot of repressed feelings. As their relationship evolves, both the man and woman go through a lot of changes and approach the brink of actual mental and physical collapse, before coming to terms with who they are as people and what they really want out of life. The woman is a playwright who writes about life but doesn't live it. The man is a womanizer who really wants love but feels incapable of making a commitment. When the two meet the sparks fly as their defenses go into full swing as they cope with a whole array of feelings about themselves and about each other. Good movie.",Something's Gotta Give
39,meeza,Sometimes had to go!,6,16 March 2004,"`Something's Gotta Give' is not based on a drunken socialite's several attempts to hook up with some ladies on a Saturday night. That would be my autobiographical film. Anyway, `Something's Gotta Give' is the romantic-comedy box office hit from Director Nancy Meyers. It stars Jack nicholson & Diane keaton. This little story about Jack & Diane is not really about two young kids growing up in the heartland. However, it is about senior lothario who craves after younger women. I wonder who plays that role? If you did not guess jack Nicholson, then you are a real jackass. Ok! Sorry! Diane Keaton plays the mother of one of Jack's young preys. `Something's Gotta Give' revolves on the unexpected romance between Jack & Diane's characters. The film does have several comedic moments and there is strong chemistry between Jack & Diane. However, `Something's Gotta Give' formulaic screenplay falls short on originality & inventiveness. Even though her work was commendable, I think someone was doing some `cheaton' when they nominated Keaton for a Best Actress Oscar. It was the most overrated acting performance of the year. `Something's Gotta Give' did not give me cinematic euphoria but it did give me a few chuckles. Hey, something had to give! *** Average",Something's Gotta Give
40,Chris_Docker,"Old-young love stories, well-worn plots, but great acting.",6,6 February 2004,"A romantic comedy in which Jack Nicholson (as Harry) revives much of his role from As Good As It Gets and plays the type of character he has in so many movies now  aging, eccentric, charismatic  but this time with an eye for the ladies  in fact ladies that are always less than half his age. Balancing heart attacks with a string of love affairs with beautiful young women, he suddenly finds himself being cared for by his latest romance (Amanda Peet), her mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and Dr Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves). Julian is attracted to the older woman. This predictable romp is enlivened by some fabulous dialogue (Harry: 'I have never lied to you, I have always told you some version of the truth.') and a talented cast. Nicholson so often overshadows everyone in a movie, but here Keaton shows she can give him measure for measure (the parts were written especially with these two actors in mind). Gradually Harry and Erica are drawn together, against their initial judgements, and this formulaic and improbable story nevertheless manages to be entertaining for a couple of hours.",Something's Gotta Give

The thing that Meyers is good at is tugging at our heart-strings, and she gets to the audience in this one as well, even from unlikely actors like normally macho Jack Nicholson making us cry. Despite the fact that the story is a little sloppy as it goes from comedy to drama back to comedy in the 1st hour, it focuses on the drama in the last half which works better. This is basically a story about love and how important it is to us no matter how old we are. Nicholson and Keaton play the elder love interests with great finesse with a slight wink always pointed towards the audience. The younger players are really just window-dressing in this one as the two big stars win out. Meyers is my vote for most un-recognized director who could win a lifetime achievement award from the Oscars before her career is over but will probably never be nominated because of her simplistic approach in her stories. Keep it up Nancy!! You're winning an audience with your simple effective movies.",Something's Gotta Give

If you ask me, I believe that Harry (Jack Nicholson) and Erica (Diane Keaton) made a cute couple. In addition, I also think they were soulmates. When they kissed and embraced each other, I got all warm and tingly inside. The scenery was very lovely, especially when they were in Paris. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved did a good job, including Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to any Jack Nicholson or Diane Keaton fan who hasn't seen it.

43,davispittman,Awesome Nancy Meyers film!,9,20 January 2016,"Well, Nancy Meyers does it again! Nancy Meyers really knows what she is doing, she's one of my absolute favorite filmmakers! The characters in this film are just so wonderfully written and they have many many deep dramatic layers to them, they certainly are not one dimensional. Diane Keaton really did deserve that academy award nomination! She was robbed, I swear she was robbed! And I'm surprised Jack Nicholson didn't get an Oscar nomination for his wonderful performance, he was great too! And one of the best things about this film is the awesome on screen chemistry that Keaton and Nicholson share throughout this movie, they really do convince you that their love is real. The script is very in depth and entertaining. This is one of those movies that can juggle comedy, drama, and romance so well! Meyers really balances everything very well! And I applaud Diane for being brave enough to do a nude scene at her age, but ya know, she looks great for her age in 2003. That scene was a hilarious scene, and I'm glad it was in there. Also the sex scenes were very funny and very romantic at the same time, which can be hard to do, so yay them! Amanda Peet and Francis McDormand were very funny and did well in their respective roles. I adore the way somethings gotta give very intelligently explores love and the reasoning behind Diane's character's loneliness and why she seems to be a little distant at times. This movie is truly very smart and fun to watch! Truly a classic! Also Keanu Reeves had a great role as well. 9/10.",Something's Gotta Give

Diane Keaton gave an exceptional performance, and I also thought Keanu Reeves was convincing as the young doctor.The film only comes off a little short of being perfect for me because the last 30 minutes (or even more) kind of needed some trimming. Back and forth we went through some familiar clichés, and for awhile there I was afraid the movie was going to end the way I didn't want it to... but I came away very pleased that everything got wrapped up precisely how I hoped it would have, even though it took some meandering around to cap it off.Regarding Keaton's nude scene, I have to say she has a damn fine body for her age, and there's nothing wrong there.",Something's Gotta Give
45,EUyeshima,Love Among the Ruins...Hardly,7,23 March 2006,"There's a great scene on the beach between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, which seems almost improvised, where they talk about his reputation for non-commitment and her supposed non-date with his doctor. Ironically it feels like a scene from ""Annie Hall"", and this mostly charming movie could have done with more seemingly spontaneous moments like this. But director/screenwriter Nancy Meyers (""What Women Want"", the ""Parent Trap"" remake) is borne out of the packaged Hollywood film-making that finds double-takes and double-entendres suitable replacements for insightful wit in a formulaic romantic comedy. Luckily, as embodied by the two veteran actors, the characters do not come off as menopausal stereotypes like some pre-""Golden Pond"", sunset-gazing couple. True, there are some serious sitcom lapses in Meyers' script, and it does lack the uniquely quirky perspective of a James Brooks in the similar feeling ""As Good As it Gets"". For the most part, however, this is quite a step up for Meyers, a refreshing look at the emotional complications that come with love among the more mature set. What is particularly nice is how sex is treated as an emotional release rather than just an act of pure passion.Nicholson plays womanizing record producer Harry Sanborn like most of his late-career roles, i.e., with a sense of eye-rolling panache that somehow gets dismantled when his character reveals too much of his vulnerability. It's probably the unsurprising aspect of his acting that allows Keaton to steal the movie from him. Looking svelte and unapologetic for her age, she brings a lovely sense of gravity to her role of successful playwright Erica Barry, a familiar type who lives in a Pottery Barn-furnished world and has rationalized love out of her life. Keaton has a great honest moment when her character reveals her true feelings outside the restaurant where she catches him on a date after their own tryst. The film somehow loses footing after this scene, as this last portion feels like the story is marking time until the plot strands eventually sort themselves out to the inevitable ending.The film looks good in a ""Metropolitan Home"" sort of way, and the supporting cast is quite capable and serviceable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly believable as the lovelorn doctor smitten with Keaton's character, but he is given short shrift by the script and comes off ultimately as a plot device. On the other hand, Amanda Peet comes across as alternately bright and flighty, a fetching combination, as Erica's daughter. Sadly underutilized as usual, Frances McDormand steals all her scenes as Erica's sister. Someday she will hopefully repeat her success with ""Fargo"" and get a meatier role deserving of her smart talent and saucy sense of humor. And even more hopefully, perhaps this movie will provide a springboard for other older-skewed romantic comedies given our country's aging demographics...but who am I kidding?",Something's Gotta Give
46,dierregi,Stumbling through love after 50,6,9 June 2017,"Once upon a time, ""older"" folks were supposed to get wiser or just drop dead soon after 50. Nowadays, with second and third acts running, people have to undergo different embarrassing experiences, such as dating after 50. Even privileged, rich people do not have it easy and don't get any wiser ... or so this movie says.However, usually older, rich and famous guys have no problem finding young girlfriends and I am sure Nicholson must have had some fun playing Henry, who's basically a version of himself. Also true that older, albeit rich and famous women over 50 do not have it as easy (lots of single female celebrities come to mind).Anyway, Keaton is Erica a divorced, famous playwright who falls for her daughter's ""boyfriend"", Henry. Unfortunately, Henry ""dates"" only young women and does not want to ""settle"". After a passionate night, Erica's illusions about having a real relationship with Henry are shattered, but the script gives Erica the upper hand, by having a youngish doctor (Reeves) falling for her. After much misunderstanding and a change of heart we get a happy ending. It is an enjoyable movie above the troubles of the rich and I watch it always with pleasure. My only negative remark is that Erica's desperation for the break-up with Henry seems slightly exaggerated. After all, she's supposed to be a sophisticated, quirky lady not an inexperienced teenager and her crying is silly and excessive. Still, good comedy.",Something's Gotta Give
47,rbverhoef,Performances make it work,7,2 March 2004,"'Something's Gotta Give' is your typical predictable romantic comedy. Well, not completely typical. Normally you don't find performances like this in these kind of movies and here they become so important that it elevates the movie and its simple story. Jack Nicholson, who is almost always the best thing in every movie, is the leading man. He plays a wealthy man who always dates younger women. He plays Jack Nicholson you would say, and for some moments you would be right, only his name here is Harry Sanborn.The best thing in almost every movie he is. Here the best thing is Diane Keaton and that alone is a reason why her Oscar nomination is one she deserves. She plays the wealthy play writer Erica Barry, the mother of Harry's last girlfriend Marin(Amanda Peet). By mistake they all have to share the same house, Harry has a heart attack, Harry has to stay with Erica and may be they will fall in love, although there must be some trouble on the way. I have told you everything you know before the movie starts. To make things a little harder there is the doctor who helps Harry, played by Keanu Reeves, who falls in love with Erica.Like I said it is a predictable, but sweet and sometimes very funny movie. Although Nicholson gives us some laughs with his charms it is Keaton who does a perfect job in every single scene. There is one sequence that involves her crying and she gets a laugh every time she does the same thing over and over again. It just the way she handles the moments, the timing of everything, that makes it the wonderful performance it is. Don't see this for a great story and hilarious sequences of goofy comedy. See it for a sweet and simple story with some very funny moments. Most of all see it for Keaton. Of course Nicholson doesn't hurt either.",Something's Gotta Give

49,EdgarST,38 minutes too long,7,3 March 2004,"Why don't most films end when they should? Robert Altman says that movies end when the best part begins, and this may be also true for Nancy Meyers' comedy. When entrepreneur Jack Nicholson suffers a stroke and has to stay in playwright Diane Keaton's beach house for a while, this romantic comedy is a winner. It's funny, fast and give both actors a great comedy situation to develop, between two characters past their prime: how a woman who thinks she is no longer attractive and the perpetual bachelor who chases girls who could be his granddaughters, fall in love. It grows slowly and beautifully, and the crucial sex scene is one of the most moving moments in recent film history. Now it's obvious that they're going to ""love each other forever and ever""(according to the rules of old-fashioned romantic comedies, after which this one was conceived), and the film could have ended there, leaving the future complications in their relationship (""the best part"", as Altman says) to our imaginations. We do not get ""the best part"": instead we get bland situations to keep our attention (Keaton's young daughter -who has dated Nicholson- suddenly has a strange concern for her father marrying a woman her age), or Nicholson competing for Keaton with Keanu Reeves (whose acting gets worse as the movie goes on and his part grows.) It's a pity, the more so because Meyers reivindicates mature and intense eroticism with style and much affection. Everybody in the cast is fine (not Reeves in the final act of the movie), including Frances McDormand, who has a very funny part in the Paula Prentiss vein, although her character appears too briefly.",Something's Gotta Give
50,rosscinema,Film works on just about all levels,7,21 December 2003,"This film is both romantic and funny but it doesn't play down to the less sophisticated viewer and the sharp writing is the main reason. Also, we get to watch two of our finest actors at the top of their game. Story is about a 63 year old man named Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) who is dating a much younger woman named Marin (Amanda Peet) and they head to her mothers summer home for the weekend but when they arrive they find that Marin's mother Erica Barry (Diane Keaton) has also decided to use the house so they decide to all stay together. That night Harry has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital where his doctor Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) takes care of him but also takes a fancy to Erica. Harry is unable to travel so he goes to stay in Erica's home for at least a week. While there the two of them start to like each other and Marin notices it. She kindly breaks off her relationship with him so now Harry and Erica can date.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****The two of them have a great week together but then Harry must get back to the city since he owns several business's. Erica waits for him to call but he doesn't and then one night she finds him in a restaurant with another woman and she takes it very hard. She decides to write a play about her situation and when it goes into production Harry is surprised that it's about his relationship with her. Harry is in love with her but he can't get her to trust him and then he starts getting anxiety attacks.This film was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who has worked with Keaton before and the trust that both of them have for each other is evident. How often is Keaton comfortable enough to do a nude scene? This film works both as a comedy and as a romance. It works on just about every level but the one area that works best is the chemistry between the two stars. Both Nicholson and Keaton are terrific together and because of this we believe in the romance. Jack is being Jack but he also shows the complexities of his character who suddenly starts to take a hard look at himself and figure out what to do about being in love for the first time. Keaton hasn't been in a role this good in a long time and she's garnering some of the best reviews of her career for her performance. The only fault in this film for me was the length and there were a few scenes that just seemed to go on a bit long. But this is a minor complaint because near the end of the film there is a truly romantic scene in Paris with the snow falling. Incidentally, this is the second time Nicholson and Keaton have worked together. The first was the epic ""Reds"". Rachel Ticotin has a small role as a doctor and I've always thought she was a very good actress who was never used enough. It was good to see her. This film is a joy to watch from start to finish and it all seems to come together with the writing and the direction. The performances by both of these actors show that even at their age love can make you do strange things and can even change you.",Something's Gotta Give
51,nycritic,Keaton and Nicholson. Finally!,8,12 April 2005,"Hollywood has never been very kind to aging couples. If you count a ratio of the movies that have been made with actors in their prime and put them side by side with movies where the same actors are reaching 50, 60, or even 70, you'd be hard-pressed to find more than a smattering over a decade's time. And to sell a romantic comedy above all to a youth-obsessed public wanting to see the inevitable tight curves on the female lead's body and the rippled muscles on the male's, where instead there are none, is a gamble that would surely signal a train wreck by default.Surprisingly enough, this one's a winner. While the story may not be the most original of all -- serial dater finds the perfect woman as a headstrong woman close to his age but loses her to his dating habits, then realizes he really does care for her after all -- is really a variation of boy-meets girl, loses girl, regains girl: with the exception that this time around, the boy is Jack Nicholson, the girl is Diane Keaton, and neither are under 55.To do a movie that has these two exceptionally mannered (but no less veteran) actors play parts that could have easily veered off into caricatures is a hard trick to pull off and thankfully the script (and their acting) is always on target to make us never forget these are real people and not their public persona. Nicholson especially has the harder part here -- his role is so close to life he could have sleepwalked through it -- but he brings a genuine humanity to what is initially a sitcom-like old lecher who can't date women older than 25. Keaton also has a difficult role because she's been known to play variations of Annie Hall, but here she lays herself bare (in more ways than one). To see her interact with Nicholson and see them play out their initial dislike, their cautious flirtation which becomes actual attraction, and see what happens to both of them once Nicholson chickens out to go back to philandering is what romantic comedies are made of. It's a great set-up, even when the pay off is a little too pat for comfort at times and seems somewhat manipulative. There were moments when I wondered what kind of a story SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE would have been had it decided on bringing Keanu Reeve's character into the front and having him being her choice, but this being a conventional script, it of course decides to have Nicholson win her back in the most traditional of ways with nary a conflict, but this doesn't detract much from the film as much as tell a good chick-flick with an emotional center.Some nice supporting roles here: Reeves plays a character totally different from his MATRIX or CONSTANTINE roles, Rachel Ticotin holds her own as the doctor whom Nicholson keeps bumping into every time his heart goes bonkers, and Amanda Peet continues to prove herself as the rising star she is becoming. Frances McDormand has fun with a small part as Keaton's sister.As a note: for a movie set in the Hampton's, NY, those were some pretty interesting looking palm trees.",Something's Gotta Give
52,eric262003,Little Ditty About Jack and Diane,7,9 December 2013,"Something's Gotta Give"" tells the tale about late middle-aged playwright named Erica Berry (Diane Keaton) who resides in a rather immaculate home located in the Hampton's in New York. She's quite capable of her independence. An aging socialite who owns ten companies including one of the world's largest hip-hop record labels, Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) like to think of her as being repellent in nature. Harry is a philanderer who likes to date women that are old enough to be his daughter (mostly in the range of 30 years or less). Harry is currently dating Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet). And just as they were about to engage in intercourse for the first time, Harry suffers a minor heart attack. After his release from the hospital, Harry was not permitted to return home; therefore he ends up shacking up with Erica and Marin. Her steely demeanour eventually sets the tone provocatively not with just Harry alone, but with his doctor, Julian (Keanu Reeves). Erica and Harry both appear to have a plethora of similar character traits aside from the obvious being that they're over the hill, but that they're insomniacs and gather little sleep themselves. They also deposit their sensitive souls and nurture their vulnerable hearts. The movie itself is the traditional romantic comedy with that the romantic interests are not young, twenty-something's looking for their soul-mates, but rather elderly people finding love towards one-another. The direction by writer/director Nancy Meyers is executed nicely, though not entirely to perfection. It seems strangely ironic but did anyone notice that Erica wears predominately white clothing and Harry dresses mostly in black? And when they were walking towards the beach, Erica was picking up the white stones and then Harry offers her a black one? It seems quite bizarre that they end wearing each other's glasses. Okay I get they're both trying to look into each other's world, but by wearing each other's glasses? Who knew?It tries to refrain from falling victim of sentimental mush like most romantic comedies seem to suffer from (you hear that Hugh Grant?)The movie is filled with some rather funny moments, sadly there were at least two scenes where dialogue was greatly needed, but instead Meyers decides to overlap the dialogue with a song. There were times where scenes dragged on for too long and left many of the main supporting characters like Marin, Julian and Erica's sister Zoe (Frances McDormand), who's a Woman's Studies professor. But still I will not knock our Keaton for her performance. This was her best role since ""Annie Hall"". Erica is smart, witty and has quite a riveting personality. Nicholson shows that he himself is a laid-back kind of guy semi-spoofing his reputation from the past and beyond. Reeves exhibit a level of intelligence, charm and appeal. Peet gives it her best in a rather underdeveloped character. And McDormand is a scene stealer; it's too bad her character was so under-used. I would recommend this movie to those who love romantic comedies and who do not mind that this movie is two hours long. It also is quite refreshing that the romantic leads are not spoiled, bratty teens or twenty something's willing to commit to their love of their life.

So Erica ends up babysitting him. Ah, yes we can see where this one is going.

So he demurs, shall we say. Meanwhile, the dashing young doctor reveals his romantic and clearly carnal interest in--no, NOT the beautiful young daughter! How prosaic would that be? No, he reveals he has quite a yen for the great playwright herself, and age does not matter in the slightest!Okay, at this point if I were a woman of any age I would say that my cup doth runneth over. I would also suspect that this Fantasyland is a bit much for belief. But hey, why should the starlets have all the fun?Anyway, Nancy Meyers's direction of this self-authored fairytale will appeal to its targeted audience no doubt, but don't try to screen this for your boyfriend. He won't survive the first reel.Incidentally, this flick is not even in the same league as the somewhat similar romantic comedy, As Good As It Gets (1997) starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, which I recommend that you see instead.

I kept waiting for a script to happen and wondered why I was so irritated ALL THE TIME. Diane Keaton ( I honestly can't believe she got a Golden Globe award for her performance) acts as if there is always a third party in the room. She keeps glancing sideways and laughing flirtatiously at NOTHING. Jack just phones his performance in, enough said.....and speaking of laughing, I, for one, hate those scenes where the main characters are on a beach, over dinner, in bed, and they are laughing, laughing, but you the viewer are not privy to the stream of jokes. And believe me there are so much of these giggling no-script scenes as to make you NAUSEOUS. You are on the outside, paying your decent money to be part of the movie/play but you are left guessing as to what is actually being said. RIP-OFF. Seems to me as if the writer just ran out of script. Speaking of which, there is NONE, no script, in this sodden wreck of a film. It is rocking with clichés (the sobbing, crying, has to be the very worst ever captured on film). And what was Keanu Reeves doing in it? Here's a young doctor madly in love with the older woman playwright, has seen all her plays and absolutely worships her, is kind, considerate and fresh (vs jarringly jaded), but the older woman just hankers after moronic old Jack who treats her incredibly badly. And in the end, unbelievably - Keanu, her new fiancé, gives her up without a fight or a word. He is just deleted from the script. I for one would have chosen Keanu any day.

He may look older than he did 30 years ago; but if there's ever been a model for NOT acting your age, he is it. ""Something's Gotta Give"" is maybe intended to suggest he's finally ceased trying to chase the dream hedonistic lifestyle; but do we really need to see one of the last great American motion-picture icons 'calcified'????! I realise I might be in the minority, but my overwhelming reaction was one of 'depression', more than anything...Call me irresponsible, but I just think it's more fun to see Nicholson playing the irrepressible 'cad', than have him mellow and trying to find his roots. He should only play 'aged' to make a point (""About Schmidt"") and not because it's a natural progression that every 'male stud' has to go through! Given that he settles into staid mediocrity by the end, it seems that the only reason to use Jack Nicholson is to lampoon his image by way of a 'jumping-off point' for the plot... To my mind, this setup is not 'risky' enough for an actor of his standing and calibre. It's not that I'm balking at the May-to-December plot; that's fair territory for cinema to travel, and it's handled sweetly and refreshingly... but wouldn't somebody like Michael Douglas fit the desired age-range without puncturing too many people's perception of him?

He's definitely a presence to watch, as an old playboy dating young women, probably similar to his actual life.I liked the movie. It tells the difference between old age and being young, and everything in between. It's higher society that is represented in the film, but it's an elegant work that anyone could enjoy. And the majority of it takes place in the Hamptons, so a beautiful beach setting is guaranteed to be admired.I would recommend this movie.6 stars",Something's Gotta Give
57,dunmore_ego,"Something's gotta give - Jack's heart, Diane's hips, or my patience.",6,17 August 2011,"Two white, upper class American senior citizens are thrown together, hate each other, and eventually fall in love. State of romantic comedy in America... yawn.Erica (Diane Keaton) hates Harry (Jack Nicholson) because he dates her daughter (Amanda Peet), and he demeans her for being stuck-up. He owns record companies and she's a best-selling author. Neither is debilitated in any way, psychologically, physically or financially. SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE - but what exactly? Conditions are so perfect for these two to hook up, what exactly has to give? Thrown together when he has a heart attack in her Martha Stewart house while with her daughter, he is advised by the local heart surgeon Dr. Julian (Keanu Reeves - we'll address this stunt casting in a moment) to rest up a few nights at her house. Daughter leaves for business, leaving Erica and Harry in abject Softening-Each-Other-Up mode. Who writes this crap?Nancy Meyers. Writer, producer, director. She's over 50, accomplished at her craft (PRIVATE BENJAMIN, FATHER OF THE BRIDE, WHAT WOMEN WANT), but enacting some delirious MILF fantasy of being stuck in a luxurious beach house for three days with Jack Nicholson sneering all over her patticake.Jack is charming, velvety and sharp. And Diane is as usual, numinous, quirky and bubbly. At one point, Harry simultaneously thrills and confuses Erica by telling her, ""You are... a woman to love."" We imagine a man once said that to Nancy Meyers and now here she is twenty paranoid years on, still trying to decipher it through her dotty female characters. We all lose.Amanda Peet is vanilla, and Starsky makes an appearance as her divorced dad. Jon Favreau passes by the middle background, as does Frances McDormand - but Theodore Logan Esquire steals the show! In a stunning performance against type, Keanu Reeves as Dr. Julian is infatuated with Erica, admiring her for her talent first and (we presume) her bangin' sexagenarian bod. He is unaware of Harry's growing feelings for Erica and unwittingly becomes the Third Man when he dates her after Harry rejects her. It is a sober, studied, informed performance that will make you question whether the guy who did BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, or POINT BREAK, or even SPEED, was Keanu's Evil Twin.Shot through with contradictions and double-standards: when Erica dates the younger Dr. Julian, she's affirming her womanhood - when Harry dates the younger daughter, he's a lecher. Erica dates Dr. Julian simply because he asked her, while gleefully admitting she is ""in love"" with someone else - and will as gleefully drop Dr. Julian when the ""right"" man comes along; once again proving that women will marry the ""wrong"" man (i.e. the one she is not in love with) simply because he asks her to.The young audience who usually falls for romantic fluff don't really want to see their grandparents grinding.

(Writing plot summarys are hard.)Nancy Meyers wrote and directed Something's Gotta Give. She wrote her first 2 movies for Goldie Hawn, Private Benjamin and Protocol, then Nancy wrote her next movies Baby Boom and Father of the Bride 1 & 2 for Diane Keaton, and this, then she wrote The Holiday and It's Complicated and The Intern for Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, and Anne Hathaway, respectively, (I'm a guy.) among writing many other really good 1s 2. She also directed those last 3 and What Women Want and The Parent Trap. (Yeah Nancy, I looked you up on the internet.) I love Nancy Meyers, and I didn't know that until today.

60,gregsrants,One word....'Refreshing',7,26 December 2003,"Refreshing.  That was the first word that popped into my find once the lights came up after the screening of Nancy Meyer's new film Something's Gotta Give.  Refreshing that a smart, well-cast and thoroughly cute film about two people over the age of 50 can be marketed to a mass audience and provide such vibrant, touching and funny individual moments. 
Perfectly cast as the two elder statesmen who fall in love are Harry Sandborn and Erica Barry played with Oscar nomination buzz by Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.   Harry, is a 63 year-old successful entrepreneur, who begins the film on a romantic getaway with Marin Barry (Erica's daughter). Erica is a successful playwright who is reluctantly assigned the task of caring for Harry in her home after he suffers a heart attack in the throws of passion with her daughter.  The two have nothing in common except age, but soon find admiration for each other and eventually fall in love.  The problem however is that Erica has not loved anyone for such a long time and she is alien to the new feelings that she is emoting and becomes overwhelmed with happiness and new found beauty.  Harry is also experiencing feelings never before realized, but is in denial and thinks the emotions will pass.  It is only after Harry continues to have anxiety attacks after each encounter with Erica that he realizes that he may be in love for the first time in his life. 
There are however complications to the love story.  Keanu Reeves, plays a young doctor that also falls for Erica and while Harry is wrestling with his newfound emotions, the doc moves in on Erica and the two start dating. Erica, shunned and broken-hearted over Harry's lack of commitment writes another play based on their experiences together, and Harry takes offence to his life being put on display for people to joke.  Nancy Meyers who directed Something's Gotta Give is on a little bit of a Hollywood roll.  She directed Mel Gibson's top grossing flick What Women Want and Disney's surprise hit of 1998, The Parent Trap, so it is fair to say that Nancy knows how to deliver to an audience.  Jack Nicholson continues to astound by producing one Oscar worthy performance after another, and this one is definitely up for consideration.  Jack shows a vulnerability, a humorous side and looks to be having as much fun in front of the camera since 1998's Batman.  But for all Jack's continued brilliance, it is Diane Keaton who stands out most in her performance.  As Erica, Diane shows us a woman who believed she was too old to fall in love again, too old to feel sexy again, and too old to start a new life.  Erica's weeping in front of her computer while writing the play based on the experience emotes both laughter and sorrow from the sucked in audience.  Look for Diane Keaton to have her name mentioned alongside the golden statue nominations in the new year.Something's Gotta Give is not a perfect film.  The flaws are slight, but still noticeable.  A running joke about Viagra is exploited one too many times, and the oft talked about nude scene when Harry walks in on Erica was unnecessary (granted, I said the same of Jack Nicholson's  About Schmidt partner Kathy Bates).  And finally, the movie comes in at 117 minutes, which is about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be.But, let's give kudos where they're due.  Jack and Diane bring to the screen limited, but sincere chemistry and it was good to see 50+ year olds using technology (computers, instant messaging) and reverting to teenage accepted emotions to explore their feelings for each other.  Refreshing.",Something's Gotta Give
61,Rogue-32,The Ballad of Jack and Diane,7,26 January 2004,"This film, from writer/director Nancy Meyers, was one of those films I put off seeing because I have seen OTHER 'comedies' from Meyers, and generally they tend to be very badly written, unfunny, uninsightful and painfully executed.  This one, however, works 90% of the time, thanks to the genuine chemistry of its two stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  Beautiful performances, especially from Keaton, who remains one of the most watchable actresses working today.  The thing that ruins the movie is the sloppy ending (involving the fact that Keanu Reeves' character winds up being merely a plot device), but it didn't reek of smarminess at least, and that's saying a lot for a Meyers endeavor.",Something's Gotta Give

The focus of the movie is very much on the two lead characters Harry (Nicholson) and Erica (Keaton). Harry is a 63 year old man who has never dated any woman over 30 and it seems never even been close to anyone. Erica bumps into Harry whilst he is dating her daughter. After being married for a number of years Erica has lost interest in relationships following her divorce. No prizes for guessing what's going to happen.Whilst, Erica's character is well played and believable, Harry's character really doesn't add up.

63,gelman@attglobal.net,Diane Keaton Is Outstanding,9,3 January 2010,"This is really quite a funny romantic comedy, mainly because of an outstanding performance by Diane Keaton as Erica Barry, a wealthy and successful playwright, who is divorced from her husband and, although lonely, apparently satisfied with her life. Along comes Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), an older man who is romancing Erica's 30-year-old daughter, Marin (Amanda Peet), who has a heart attack while at Erica's lavish beach home in the Hamptons and who is told by emergency room doctor, Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), that he must remain in the Hamptons, not return to New York City. Erica and Harry have a spectacular sexual encounter that shakes Erica's foundations and that leaves Harry suddenly vulnerable in a way he's never been before. There are subplots -- in particular, an unlikely romance between the much younger Dr. Mercer and Erica and the opening of Erica's new play which is basically about her relationship with Harry -- but the looming question is whether Erica and Harry will eventually get together. Keaton is really quite wonderful, especially after Harry walks away from romance to return to his habit of bedding much younger women. She is crying regularly and at the same time laboring intensively on her play, breaking into laughter which quickly turns to tears. Jack Nicholson plays a character he has played many times before, but it has earned him a lot of money and he has the part down perfectly. Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves are props but they are gorgeous props. Frances McDormand, as Erica's sister, a professor of women's studies, makes a more significant contribution but she is on the screen only briefly.

An old man called Harry (Nicholson) liked to have fun with young ladies, and presumably consumed Viagra to have sex with them. One day before having sex with a beautiful young girl his heart was shocked by Viagra and taken to the hospital with urgency by the girl and her mother (Diane Keaton). The doctor Mercer (Keanu Reeves) advised how to behave in order to recover him and to live better his days. During the period of recovery Harry sat in the young girl's house, where he had the opportunity to know and to interact with the mother's girl, Erica. The result was that both felt in love with each other. However, later the old man continued trying to have fun with other young girls and once he was caught by Erica. She was disappointed to the extent that she obviously stopped any kind of relationship while Harris did everything to apologize and tried to come back with Erica. The other ingredient of the film is that the young doctor Mercer also felt in love with Erica making this triangle relationship more difficult. The comedy is nice to see and Diane Keaton acted very well.",Something's Gotta Give

67,lawprof,"Keaton: Radiant, Glorious, Funny, Wise. Nicholson: Likable, Sad, Hopeful, Changing",9,12 December 2003,"Writer and director Nancy Myers has a sure hit with her fantasy romantic comedy ""Something's Gotta Give.""  Fantasy?  Yes in the sense that  all films that bring together ideally realized characters rarely reflect the grit of true encounters on the road to or detour from romance and love.Jack Nicholson's name heads the title list but Diane Keaton's should have. In this story about a successful playwright, Erica Barry, Keaton is luminously beautiful, starkly sensual and both funny and sad.  In one series of scenes she may have set the record for consuming tissues by the boxful.Barry has been divorced for a long time but is on good relations with her ex who is also involved in producing her plays.  Amanda Peet is drop-dead-beautiful daughter Marin who arrives at Erica's Hampton's ""cottage"" (that's what they modestly call oceanfront mansions out there) with Nicholson, millionaire Harry Langer.  Marin is near thirty, Harry is not only over twice her age but he has a long, unbroken history of dating and bedding gals young enough to be his progeny.  Erica and sister Zoe, Frances McDormand, interrupt an incipient role in the hay.A quick cardiac event suffered by Harry in the throes of making out with Marin brings intimations of mortality handled deftly by Dr. Mercer, Keanu Reeves.  As the treating physician who becomes friends with both Harry and Erica, Reeves is well-cast.The rest of the story?  Will Harry succumb to Erica's charms or continue prowling for young chicks?  Will Dr. Mercer, a man who is clearly a babe magnet, find his true soulmate in the much older playwright?  The comedy and light drama move back and forth, perhaps slightly longer than necessary.Ms. Keaton hasn't been this alluring and interesting in a long time.  Her Erica has forgotten what romance is like without shedding her innate loveliness, one with no relation to age.  Her gestures and expressions reflect her character's rocky and unexpected conscription back into the world of dating, love and - yes - sex.Jack Nicholson has almost trademarked the role of the modern man who is self-absorbed, angst-prone and capable of audience pleasing change.  In 1997's ""As Good As It Gets"" he's a truly nasty, at times genuinely repulsive, character saved by the love and strength of Helen Hunt.  More recently in ""About Schmidt"" Nicholson wanders after his wife's sudden death looking for support and sympathy while intruding on his grown-up daughter's life, believing erroneously that he was the committed father he imagined himself to be.  Hope Davis as his daughter set him straight and Kathy Bates liberated his soul.  Sort of.Nicholson in this film is more likable than in some past roles.  His pursuits of young women are essentially harmless - he doesn't recognize the true vacuity of searching for and settling on beautiful young bedmates from whom he wants nothing but physical intimacy and arm candy presence in posh spots.The interaction between Nicholson and Keaton is believable and even (forgive me) moving.  I think these two veteran actors truly enjoyed making ""As Good As It Gets"" after two decades of not appearing together.Yes the flick's a fantasy but it consistently produced very big laughs in the theater and it compels interest.  And Ms. Keaton deserves at the least an Oscar nomination.I hope we see more of her in that most sorely lacking genre: nice movies for adults.  Nice movies that celebrate the reality that romance doesn't just belong to the young.9/10.",Something's Gotta Give
68,movieguy1021,Something's Gotta Give: 6/10,6,29 December 2003,"Something's Gotta Give is full of seconds. Although I haven't seen The Matrix Revolutions, it's the second movie recently in which Keanu Reeves hasn't said the word `whoa'. It's the second movie recently in which Jack Nicholson shows his backside. And it doesn't stop and take a second to think about what the audience may want. It's one of the most self-indulgent movies of the year, more so even than Tarantino's Kill Bill. It's more of a swan song to Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, saying that older people can still do things younger people can. And the movie tries to hide this under a sweet layer of romantic comedy, and for the most part it works.Harry (Nicholson) is notorious for dating younger girls, girls half and one third his age. His current beau is Marin (Amanda Peet). They go to her mother's house in the Hamptons while she is away, but her mother Erica (Keaton) comes back with her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand). While there, Harry has a heart attack and the doctor (Keanu Reeves) cares for him. During that time, Harry and Erica fall in love and Julian (Reeves) falls in love with Erica.To say a clichéd line, Something's Gotta Give (which is one of the worst titles of the year) has its moments. Some moments border on hilarity, but for each one of those there are some dead fifteen minute stretches. It seemed like the romance between the two leads seemed forced. Erica seemed a little charmed by him, but the audience could tell that there wasn't really any charm in him. It seemed that everything happened to further the plot, and Nancy Meyers didn't really care that it wasn't believable.Some minor irks I had with the movie were that it looked like much was cut out on the sides. I assume that's a problem with the framing. As much as I hate unnecessary widescreen, maybe putting it into 2:35 to 1 or something would have made it look better. There are two ways to get accolades for your acting: either play a mentally slow person or cry a whole lot. That's probably why Keaton is getting such rave reviews: she cries so much, unbelievably, towards the end. Although some is played for humor, it grates on you after awhile, and really seems fake.Nicholson seemed to be sleepwalking through his role. He didn't really put much emotion into it. Some may call it senility, but then I say what about About Schmidt? Keaton was quite good, despite what I said earlier. Peet, my favorite actress, once again performs believably, and has good screen time, despite what I heard. McDormand, who is third billed, is only in one or two scenes but acts well. Her role could have been expanded more. Reeves seems to only do well in roles that aren't that strenuous, such as his here, and he's very good.I can't claim to say I loved Something's Gotta Give, or even liked it a lot, but it had its moments, and worked to some extent.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sexual content, brief nudity and strong language.",Something's Gotta Give

That is definitely not the case here.Certainly where you have an ""A-List"" group as in this flick, you have a right to expect some top-notch entertainment.

70,ruby_fff,Wonderful pairing of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson - a mature love story with reminiscing ballads abound,8,1 February 2004,"Diane Keaton's acceptance speech at the 61st Golden Globe Awards 2004 was so energized Yes, w-d Nancy Meyers ""Something's Gotta Give"" is worth recommending - especially to Keaton and Nicholson fans. I applaud Meyers' directorial debut in the remake of ""The Parent Trap"" 1998 - it was fun watching the talented Lindsay Lohan times two along with Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson. Found Mel Gibson quite funny in her second film ""What Women Want"" 2000. I thoroughly enjoyed this third film from w-d Meyers. It's a romantic comedy with personal touches instilled - nostalgic temperaments more in the mood of a mature love story of a woman and a man beyond 50's. It may be a tad long as the story winds down - feels like it's going for too complete a closure (perhaps Nicholson's explanation in visual segments can be spared - I remember the treatment that Wayne Wang used in ""Smoke"" where Harvey Keitel was quite captivating delivering a verbal description for 10 mins.). A verbal delivery by Nicholson could never be dull (perhaps a little much in ""Anger Management"" for non-Sandler fans). The two stars, Keaton as Erica and Nicholson as Harry (now that would be when Harry met Erica) - including a much more relaxed Keanu 'out of Matrix' Reeves as the young handsome doctor Julian pursuing Erica - it's an amusing 2 hours pleasantly spent.
Frances McDormand appears in brief scenes as Keaton's sister, Zoe - almost repeating the persona of ""Laurel Canyon"" sans the flirts and flings. Amanda Peet - lovely as ever with her spunky and lively energy pervades even when she's sobbing! She plays Keaton's daughter Marin who was the start of it all - introducing Nicholson's Harry into Erica's life. Erica is a modern woman of the nineties personified, yet when the love bug bites, catching her unaware - or is it Annie Hall growing up? Keaton delivers as always, but more verve emanated playing opposite Nicholson. Nicholson is vintage - it's awfully fun watching him and he's totally giving without worries of embarrassing bearing rears (say, in the hospital scenes). The plot is not at all implausible, or is it? Does one care in such a blissful tale, plus down to earth heart attack health notes a-plenty? It's love actually rather endearing.I noticed there's quite a few popular French tunes included in the movie: ""C'est si bon"", ""La vie en rose"", and I was literally humming along to the delightful Trenet's 1938 ""Boum"" (but not included on the soundtrack CD). Ah, there's ""Sweet Lorraine"", ""Brazil"", ""Summer Samba"", Gershwin's ""I've Got a Crush on You"", and Harry Warren's ""I Only have Eyes for You"".

74,diac228,So what if the main characters of this flick are over 50?,9,17 January 2007,"Is there such thing as a sophisticated romantic comedy anymore? Honestly, come on. No matter what the film is, there is always this hint of immaturity waved around that keeps it away from being a truly mature film. But, low and behold, we have one of the best romantic comedies in years here. Coming from the romantic expert Nancy Meyers, whom was responsible for the awesome What Women Want, crafts another witty and charming film about the ups and downs of relationships and dating. Mixing wonderful dialogue with superb acting, Something's Gotta Give is a tour-de-force that unleashes the best out of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, and also sends hope to those that have given up on love.This film follows Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) an aging bachelor with a lust for much younger females having to stay at his latest fling's (Amanda Peet) home after a heart attack, and upon this incident meets his fling's mother, the strong independent Erica (Diane Keaton). Their personalities results in some clashing at first, but after some time they realize that what they need the most to be happy is right in front of their faces. But, haunting memories, a handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves), and also their stubbornness gets in the way and potentially ruins the spark that ignites the house every time they are within a few feet of each other. What's worse is that for some reason Harry's condition is not improving as fast as he hopes.The acting runs the film, carries the film, and keeps it unbelievably believable. Jack Nicholson, who seems to do a great job no matter what role he has, once again shines as the aging bachelor whose views towards life changes drastically after a crisis. It is hard to convince an audience that a man that is over 60 can attract so many young gals, but Nicholson uses his suave, laid-back attitude, charisma, and charming abilities and delivers the best performance in the film. You can see him deteriorate without him having to say a single word, and that my friends, is good acting. Almost outperforming him is the cute and lovable Diane Keaton. Keaton despite aging past 50 looks like she never aged after the 70s, and her charm and low-key sex appeal is the perfect match for Nicholson. Their chemistry flows out of the screen and makes ordinary couples look as bland as a Seattle rainstorm. Let's not forget the wonderful performances of Amanda Peet, Keanu Reeves, and Frances McDormand as Erica's sister.With romantic comedies, one highly overlooked feature is the writing and dialogue. This is something that is not present in a lot of romantic flicks, and is an overrated feature of Annie Hall. In this case however, the dialogue is fresh, entertaining, and never seems forced. While this can be credited in part to the actors and actresses, we cannot take away all the credit from writer-producer-director Nancy Meyers, whom has become almost an expert in this category. Also adding to the dialogue are the plot twists, turns, and surprises. Just when you think what happens next, a curveball gets thrown at you. While the ending can be predicted, the bumps leading up to it cannot. Building up on comedy in the beginning, and then adding the drama as the third act rolls around, Something's Gotta Give follows the same formula that made What Women Want an unusually bearable chick flick for people of all genders: takes a nice concept and stretches it to an extent, and then slowly mellows down as the love begins blooming.Bottom Line: Funny, witty, realistic, and very sophisticated; Something's Gotta Give is another winner from Nancy Meyers. While her writing and directing was on par with the romantic classics that shape the genre to what it is today, it's truly the acting that brings this nice story to life. Oscar-worthy performances from Keaton and Nicholson makes up for the rather long running-time and their chemistry on-screen is a rare treat indeed. Take notes Woody Allen, because we have a director that can weave a better romantic film. Hush critics, Allen is no Meyers, as Something's Gotta Give tops any romantic movie that Woody Allen can come up with. Let the bashing begin, but either way, this is worth renting, even buying for your significant other.",Something's Gotta Give
75,bix171,Hack Work,5,28 January 2004,"There's less than meets the eye in Nancy Meyers' romantic-comedy-cum-ageist/feminist-polemic about a roué (Jack Nicholson) who has an affair with a successful, self-reliant playwright (Diane Keaton), the mother of one of his attempted conquests. Nicholson and Keaton provide a bit of good chemistry but it isn't enough to overcome Meyers' whiny tutoring on what women really want, which is apparently to turn men into women. (Meyers' blunt script makes no bones about it--Nicholson even shouts it out at the end.) As a director, Meyers barely has any presence, preferring to let Jon Hutman's stale production design carry the load. (It's also hard to believe the faded cinematography is the work of the great Michael Ballhaus.) As a writer, she seems to think placing erudite Easterners in glamorous locations such as the Hamptons automatically bestows substance on her stilted dialogue, but she reveals herself to be shallow and filled with unpleasant spite: Keaton's supposedly acclaimed playwright is unmasked to be little more than a hack who finds her revenge in humiliation. Keanu Reeves plays the younger man who comes between Keaton and Nicholson; it would have been nice to see him getting back into the comic form he was so comfortable with in `Parenthood' and `Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' but he's given very little to do and ends up being an unneeded straight man. With wasted, underwritten performances by Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau; Meyers has also found a way to do something other directors could not: sap the delightfully aloof sexuality out of Amanda Peet.",Something's Gotta Give
76,mnpollio,Amusing rom-com weakened by unlikely ending,7,25 January 2011,"While not especially a huge fan of either Nicholson or Keaton, nor director/screenwriter Nancy Meyers, I must admit that this mature romantic comedy certainly does have enough highlights and memorable moments to make viewing it worthwhile. Over-the-hill cad Nicholson suffers a heart attack while romping with his much younger girl toy (Amanda Peet) at her mother Diane Keaton's beach house. Circumstances require the flustered and not very amused Keaton to play nursemaid to Nicholson and the two fall in love, but not without pitfalls. On the downside, Meyers direction is occasionally uneven and the film shares a problem of some of her earlier work in that it drags on longer than is really necessary, but these are relatively minor complaints. Nicholson is well cast as the Lothario who refuses to consider a relationship with a woman his age until trapped with one and then doesn't know how to sustain said relationship. The initial dinner table conversation where he unwittingly keeps managing to offend Keaton is quite funny, as are Keaton's reactions to having to be saddled with an overgrown kid as a housemate. Keaton often seems ill-at-ease to me on camera, but here she inhabits the role of a successful playwright experiencing romance from unlikely sources and hits all of the right notes. The slapstick scene where Nicholson accidentally walks in on her naked and her comical reaction is deservedly singled out as a great comic moment in filmdom. Keaton is warm and personable and easily deserved the Oscar nomination that this film brought her. Peet is largely wasted as her daughter, while it is difficult to understand how or why an actress the stature of Frances McDormand got stuck with the nothing role of Keaton's sister, who is basically on hand to hook her up with an adoring young doctor (Keanu Reeves) who is treating Nicholson and makes a third corner of a romantic triangle. While Reeves is surprisingly appealing here, his character is little more than a plot contrivance and the writing surrounding this character weakens the final third of the film. Reeves' doctor is a handsome, successful, good-natured guy who is obviously impressed by and ultimately in love with Keaton shortly after their meeting. In short, he would be a catch that any woman would kill for. Yet Keaton spends much of the film forgetting him and taking him for granted. When Nicholson is sprung from her care and immediately is unfaithful, Keaton falls back on Reeves and they develop a relationship. Although it should be ideal, it sometimes looks as though Keaton's character holds the Reeves' character at arms length - as though she cannot allow herself to warm to the new relationship because she knows by the climax she needs to fall back into Nicholson's arms, an approach that weakens the romantic triangle and makes the film seem more generic than it should. The final scenes are fairly unbelievable. Moments before Reeves' is about to propose to Keaton, they run into Nicholson on the street. A moment later Keaton returns to Nicholson to announce that Reeves detected an old chemistry between them and gallantly stepped aside so they could be together. It is definitely a ""WHAT THE...?!"" moment. It takes place completely offscreen and requires a herculean suspension of disbelief of common sense and human nature. The film fails to answer why a woman as intelligent as Keaton would run back to an unfaithful cad at all, much less drop a great guy who was about to propose to her to do so, without so much as a regret or a look backward. And cinematic gallantry aside, would there be any guy in the world that would blithely take a back seat with the woman he loves and cross himself out of the race based on a chance meeting on the street? It is an ending that just plain doesn't work in that it is difficult to believe that Keaton would resume such a relationship with the guy who stomped on her heart.",Something's Gotta Give
77,chron,Bad Casting Killed an Decent Movie,5,25 October 2004,"This is the story of an older man, played by Jack Nicholson, with a distaste for women his own age and an affinity for women much younger than he.The basic plot idea seemed very predictable and I had little interest in seeing it. My wife wanted to see it and it was on HBO, so what the heck. The plot was indeed predictable, but played out much better than I expected.The characters played by Nicholson and Diane Keaton had considerably more depth than I expected.This could have been a good movie, but there was one fatal flaw. Diane Keaton can't act. Much of her dialogue was giddy giggling that was befitting a teen and much of her dialog was delivered while chuckling and giggling. Much of acting is reacting. There was a scene where Nicholson's character grabbed her behind, and it seems like there was a full second before she reacted to it.If you do like Diane Keaton and don't mind a formulaic movie, then this one will be an enjoyable 128 minutes. Even though I don't care for Keaton's acting, Nicholson and Amanda Peet helped to cover the movie's shortcoming considerably. The plot was a little more intelligent than I thought, so in all the movie wasn't that bad for me, either.",Something's Gotta Give

Should have been nominated for Golden Globe and Oscar again. But I guess the problem is that he might have won. Jack makes acting look too easy. He is such an extraordinary performer. I just look at him and start  laughing.  I agree with Shirley Mac Laine            (`Terms of Endearment' ,  `Steel Magnolias') when she stated in an ` Inside the Actors Studio' episode that she looks at Jack and starts laughing.   He is so entertaining. His characterizations was perfect.  I loved when he sees Erica Barry naked and runs into a bookshelf.     All the detail that he adds to his characters is amazing. I have watched `As Good as it Gets` a million times, sometimes I just watch it to pay attention to all of Jack's moves. I LOVE JACK! He is tired of dating those days Diane!!!! He wants a woman to love. Diane Keaton ( `Baby Boom'  love that movie,  `Crimes if the Heart') `Erica Berry' is terrific! I love that character. I guess most middle age women would. That part is good for women.  I believe I've seen most of Ms. Keaton's  work  and think that she deserved the Golden Globe.  I just did not like her outfit that she wore for the Golden Globes. She has such a nice figure. Show it off! Don't hide it. You are a beautiful lady, Diane.Then there is Oscar winner Frances Mc Dormant (`Fargo'), Keanu Reeves (`The Matrix'), new comer Amanda Peet ( `Identity') with great performances and a great dialogues because of  the writing of Nancy Mayers  (`Baby Boom', `The Parent Trap' among other great works). I find it very interesting that just reading about the actors, directors, writers work, that Nancy Mayer's movies are among my favorite movies. I did not realize that until now. Great Movie! Favorite scenes: Harry Sanborn seeing Erica Barry naked. The faces that Harry makes when he  sees  the stairways. I love that house at the beach! I love the Hamptons, love the photography, the music, the cast.Favorite quotes: `Harry : I've never seen a woman that age naked before.' `What's with the turtlenecks.' Coincidently I love turtle necks, Summer and all.  Elegant, perhaps..or ` Less is more.' Highly recommended. Get the DVD or the VHS, there is a lot of real funny dialog.",Something's Gotta Give
79,jpintar,"Sweet, but fatally overlong",5,5 April 2004,"Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are a terrific couple in Something's Gotta Give.  The first hour and fifteen minutes are great.  However, the film goes on needlessly for about another hour.  Keanu Reeves and Frances McDormand are unnecessary characters that are given way too much screen time.  Why are these two characters in the movie?  Just when you think the movie may end, it keeps going on and on.  They had an excellent 90 minute movie, but by extending it, they made it into a so-so 2 hour plus movie. A subplot about Keaton's new play just derails the second half of the movie.  I don't know why people want to make romantic comedies go on with needless complications just so the movie goes over two hours.

I assume he got the part riding on his name, because he doesn't resist close ups anymore, no matter how charming he could be and accepting that he's an excellent actor, but not for this type of character any longer (ten years ago maybe, impossible by 2003).Diane Keaton smiles too much and too broadly, a la Goldie Hawn, without any call for it most of the time (does smiling as far as your back molars make you look younger??).Keanu Reeves looks like Death Warmed Over, I wonder if he has some blood in his veins or they used a dummy activated by remote control... he's perfect for playing aliens and in science fiction movies, but not good to play earthlings.

This forced relationship will cause them to feel something that they though they would not feel ever: love. Of course, both lives will have to change a lot if they want to be happy with each other. The plot is quite typical for a romantic comedy and it makes it a little predictable, but the good chemistry between the two main characters (Nicholson and Keaton) and the fact that they do not do a bad acting at all (well they are good actors) is the main point of the film.

85,ScottDMenzel,"A Funny, Well Paced Dramedy with terrific acting and a great script.",8,9 December 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I went to a special sneak preview tonight of Something's Gotta Give. I have seen two trailers for this movie. The first one was hilarious and the second one gave away too much and made the movie to look uninteresting. So I had some mixed feelings when going into the sneak preview. Jack Nicholson is a fabulous actor so I was hoping for him to make this movie great.
The movie starts off with Harry (Jack Nicholson) and Marin (Amanda Peet), who are making a weekend trip to Marin's parents beach house for a romantic weekend but just before their weekend begins Marin's mom Erica (Diana Keaton) and her friend Zoe played by Frances McDormand come home to ruin their weekend. Harry then decides to spend the weekend with his girlfriend Marin and her mother and friend. Harry at dinner begins to share his past and his love to date younger women and how he would never date women his own age. This whole conversation starts making Harry feel uncomfortable and he excuses himself from the dinner table. In the next scene, we see Erica and Zoe talking about Harry in the kitchen when cleaning up from dinner. Marin comes in and accuses her mother of being to judgmental and states Harry is a great guy. Marin leaves the room and Harry and her start kissing and Harry passes out from a heart attack. Harry is then rushed to the doctor. Dr. Julian ( Keanu Reeves) tells Harry that he has to stay off his feet and can't go back to his home in the city until he is better. Julian then suggests that Harry spends a week at Erica's home until he gets better. Harry fears this but Erica and him soon find out they're not so different from each other after all and a special relationship and bond is born.The movie's acting is top notch. Jack Nicholson proves once again that he is a terrific actor and can play any type of character. He plays both the dramatic role and the comedic role in the movie flawlessly. Diana Keaton who is terrific as the overworked play writer who is divorced and feels she can never feel love again. Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, and Amanda Peet had smaller supporting roles but were very good playing their roles.
The director Nancy Meyers whose first movie was What Women Want is back. I will admit I hated What Women Want, I thought it was stupid and unfunny. I was glad that Nancy Meyers was able to write and direct this movie with such expertise. She made a great film here. The script was fresh and funny. It added a lot of new jokes to the big screen and most importantly the film had a good point in the end. She pulled off the perfect Dramedy of not being over the top stupid funny and not being very sappy on the dramatic side. I applaud her work on this film and I hope her next film will be just as good as this one.So in Conclusion, The movie may be a bit predictable at times but the script was fresh and the film had the right mix of comedy and drama. The film itself ended on a very meaningful note. The acting by the two main leads Jack Nicholson and Diana Keaton is superb. This movie is definitely worth checking out and proves to Hollywood that you can make a romantic comedy by doing something different. My final rating for Something's Gotta Give is an 8/10. See it if you can. It may be one of the best Mainstream movies released this year.",Something's Gotta Give
86,willrams,Too Much Too Soon or Late,6,15 January 2004,"I'm a real fan of Jack Nicholson's but this film I feel is too silly, too maudlin, and rather boring.  I am a sentimentalist but this film is not the best that Nicholson has ever done.  His lady friends are all mixed up.  He falls in love with the mother of the daughter he was dating, Diane Keaton, and, well, she's a fine actress but when she gets jilted or jealous she goes into fits of raging and crying which I thought was just too maudlin.  It's really a women's picture, and Keanu Reeves does his best to show Diane his love, but she is 20 years older than him, while Jack is about as old as she is.  This is neither comedy nor romance.  The music is terrible and doesn't seem to apply.  I feel it could have been a much better adult story if there were more adult acting, ie. more discipline.  6/10",Something's Gotta Give

90,Ronin47,"Nothing groundbreaking, but smart and pleasant (***)",7,8 January 2004,"Jack Nicholson, in full-on, acerbic, arched eyebrows ""Jack Nicholson"" mode, plays Harry, a 63 year-old man who has always been a rolling stone when it comes to relationships. He has never been married and only dates uncomplicated, much younger women. The latest much younger (but actually fairly complicated) woman is Marin (Amanda Peet), but when he has a heart attack while seducing her, he ends up staying at her family's beach house being cared for by her mother, a guarded, divorced playwright named Erica (Diane Keaton).
Of course, if you've seen the trailers, commercials, or even any movies like this before you know that ""Jack & Diane"" (as the poster says) are going to get together. What is nice, though, is that the process of their falling in love with one another is realistic, complicated and pretty enjoyable. It's also good to see actors in these roles who are significantly older than the usual mid-30's actors and actresses we get in romance movies.
The number one reason to see this movie is the acting. Not by Jack Nicholson, or Amanda Peet, or Keanu Reeves (as Harry's doctor), or even the too-rarely seen Frances McDormand (in a great supporting role as Erica's sister), even though they are all very good. Nope, this movie is all about Diane Keaton. She is simply amazing here, in her best role in several years. She makes her character fully and completely human. Each emotion, be it happiness, anger, or heartbroken pain is transmitted to the audience with perfect clarity. Anyone old enough to be concerned with the passing of the years will have much to identify with in her character.
Other than the excellent acting by the whole ensemble and some clever dialogue, nothing about ""Something's Gotta Give"" is particularly mind-blowing. Plus, it's too long, some of the jokes are a bit stale (the fact that Harry owns a hip-hop record label called ""Drive-By Records"" might have been funny back in 1995, but is lame bordering on slightly offensive now), and I'm not too jazzed by the ending.

When the two are introduced through Erica's daughter, Zoe (Francis McDormand), who Harry happens to be dating, things begin to get a little haughty.  A heart attack incident soon changes Harry's perspective on life and brings him closer to Erica, who has remained isolated and alone for far too long. In a series of laugh-out-loud corny scenes, Harry and Erica get involved. Erica learns to let her guard down and Harry learns the beauties of an older woman.In the background, a young Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) is competing for Erica's affections whilst Harry begins to go back to his old ways of chasing after the younger opposite sex.  This movie humorously challenges all of the stigmas and stereotypes regarding relationships and age.

It's adorned in a light, funny, fast moving, witty dialogue.   If the plot (nubile-bent, aging Lothario falls for woman his age) is a wee bit implausible, contrived and retro to the glossy, urbane comedies of the Hepburn-Tracy era where everyone had lots of money and watered in the best restaurants, we can forgive it.  Frankly it's a great relief after years of flying kung-fu bodies and fruit-stand demolishing car chases. Where our oars kick up and catch a few crabs is in the unconvincing love scenes between Keaton and Nicholson. They give it their all but fall a little short of target. Their performances are so strong, however, that once again we are compelled to forgive. We get to see two frames of Diane's (then) 58-year-old body au naturel, quite enough of Jack's butt, and get to hear the prognosis of his little friend, ""Mr. Midnight."" Some of Diane's character's extreme and prolonged emotional tantrums caused me to spot check my wrist-watch. However, I certainly recommend the film if only to get the taste of the standard roadside truck stop Hollywood cuisine out of your mouth.

Erica Berry (Diane Keaton) and Harry Sanborg (Jack Nickolson) meet because Harry is dating Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet), a woman over 35 years younger. Harry's reputation is he never dates a woman over 30. Marin might also be looking for a father figure in her boyfriend. Harry then meets the accomplished playwright Erica Berry, and while trying to have relations with her daughter has a heart attack and this brings in the other man in a surprising love triangle Dr. Julian Mercer (Kianu Reeves). Dr. Mercer is much younger than Erica (20 years younger), and pursues her intensely. Erica's sister, Zoe (Frances Mc Dormand) teaches womens studies at a University and has a dim view of Harry and Marin's ""December - May"" relationship and Harry's notoriety for being a bachelor.The love triangle blossoms wonderfully in front of the audience' eyes and Julian won't let things like being stood up by Erica and never getting an apology for it, stop him from having a relationship with her. At the same time, Harry's cliché chauvinistic need to be with another woman gives rise to a almost everlasting cry from Erica. So we get to Dancing Henries who are major characters in a successful play that features the death of a character like the cliché Harry who was apparently renamed Henry.The movie sends a message about people of the same age needing to consider people their age. Dr Mercer, continues pursuing Erica, regardless of how much she tries to push him off. Fiannly, he feels the need to back off, when Harry pursues her to Paris and barges in on her birthday celebration with Dr. Mercer. Right after proposing marriage, Dr. Mercer lets Erica go back with the man who is only eight years older, Harry. Finally Erica and Harry are the couple that emerges from the roller coaster of relationships in this movie.There is some comedy, and cute lines and biting comments like, you are ""A Woman to Love"", which became the title of the play that Erica wrote killing off an imaginary Harry/Henry. It has some Norman Lear like preaching to men and lack of realism, that always angered me about Norman Lear's television shows.

97,clydestuff,Nancy Meyers uses her writing and directing skills to make an excellent film,10,29 December 2003,"Of the many things I like about going to the movies there are two experiences that always stand out more than others.  The first is going to see a film that you have so-so expectations for and finding out that it is not only better than expected, but very good indeed.  The second is going to see a film you have high expectations for and not being disappointed. Something's Gotta Give falls squarely into the second category.Sometimes when legendary stars are teamed up in a film, the result is often less than passable.  Not so with this film, thanks to a sharp-witted script and direction by Nancy Meyers, two great stars in Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson who click wonderfully together on screen and an excellent supporting cast that includes Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand.  This is a romantic comedy that is funny when it's meant to be, insightful when it needs to be, and filled with many sincere and touching moments. Harry Sanborn (Nicholson), the over-age playboy who has spent his entire life avoiding serious commitments, is set to spend the weekend with his flavor of the moment girlfriend, Marin(Amanda Peet), at a beach house owned by Marin's mother.  Unfortunately for Harry and Marin, Marin's mother Erica Barry(Diane Keaton), who is a famous playwright, shows up for the weekend also with her sister Zoe(Frances McDormand).  Of course Erica doesn't quite know how to deal with the fact that her daughter is dating and possibly sleeping with a man of Harry's reputation and age leading to some very funny dialog between Harry, Erica and Zoe that rings mounds of truth.  It's these early scenes in the film that sets the pace, grabs your attention, then never lets you go.  Later, when beginning to get it on with Marin, Harry suffers a heart attack.  Now I know having a heart attack is not supposed to be particularly funny, but in this case it's some of the many many hilarious scenes that rock throughout Something's Gotta Give.  When Harry is taken to the hospital, we meet Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), who happens to be a great admire of Erica's plays and quickly develops a crush on her.  Of course, plot manipulations being what they are, Harry ends up recuperating alone in Erica's beach house.  Everything that happens from that point on speaks volumes about love, aging, and especially how men and women are viewed differently as they grow older.  I can't say enough here about Diane Keaton's performance in this film.  For all the dramatic roles she has played, she once again proves how truly versatile she is with this very touching yet truly comedic role.  Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn, is equally perfect also.  He manages to take a character that we should absolutely loathe for his shallow behavior and make him not only likable but gives him depth as well.  It is perhaps his best comedic role ever.  Keanu Reeves in a less flashy role, shines as the young Doctor.  We believe in his sincere admiration for Erica and he manages to pull it off by making us believe this is not just a school boy type crush. For some brief but very funny moments, Frances McDormand deserves our praise also.Nancy Meyers has shown great promise as a director with the OK efforts of The Parent Trap and What Women Want.  As a writer she has had some fine moments with Irreconcilable Differences, Baby Boom and Father of the Bride. With Something's Gotta Give, she puts the pieces of the puzzle together for some first class entertainment.  You won't be disappointed.My Grade: A+",Something's Gotta Give
98,alexduffy2000,"Fun, But 30 Minutes Too Long",5,16 February 2004,"The best thing about ""Something's Gotta Give"" is the chemistry between Keaton and Nicholson.  These two veterans play very well off of each other in this romantic comedy.  Keaton is especially good, it shows there are parts for actresses who are over 40-years-old.  However, a lot of scenes tend to drag, the plot in this movie is nothing special, and the characters aren't that original or that much of a stretch.  This is a good movie to watch with your wife on Valentine's Day, nothing more.",Something's Gotta Give
99,btm1,Great cast and sound track in this comedy of an older lecher maturing.,9,26 August 2005,"Frances McDormand almost steals the movie in her role of Diane Keaton's younger sister, but she has a much smaller part than Diane K and Jack N, who are both in almost every scene. Amanda Peete also looked and performed great in her role as Diane's daughter. And there are many beautiful young women on display in the film (eye candy for us guys.) Great sound track. I love Eartha Kitt, and you'll also recognize a Paul Simon number. A surprise at the end is that the credits list one of the songs as performed by Jack, and he sounds great. Very gutsy because he reprieves a song performed earlier by Louie Armstrong. Although a comedy, if you are suffering from a broken heart you might get teary in parts that would otherwise just seem funny.",Something's Gotta Give
100,Casablanca3784,Too long,6,23 December 2003,"I'm sort of fed up with Jack Nicholson. Once again he's on screen with that obnoxious grin, obnoxious arrogance, slimy appearance and beady eyes.In this film he's a 63 year old Viagra-popping lover boy whose prey are women in their 20s. But Diane Keaton is 56 in this film so what kind of chemistry could there be? There is but the test tube stinks. The picture has its funny and poignant moments however it's way too long and tedious. I rated it a 6, just slightly better than average which was doing it a favor. I'm not saying that Keaton and Jack cannot be nominated for and win Oscars but I for one would vote for neither.",Something's Gotta Give

Nobody's re-inventing the wheel here, but any movie with Jack on board tends to be better than it looks on paper. And plastic surgeons everywhere, beware...Diane Keaton proves that it ain't all about the nips and tucks (well, maybe the nips, but in an entirely different sense of the word). She's as beautiful and funny as ever, and her ""bi-polar"" scene at the typewriter is a riot. The fabulous Frances McDormand is a hoot and a half in her scenes, and, much as it pains me to admit it, Keanu Reeves actually clocks in with a fairly contained performance.",Something's Gotta Give

Not only is the story great it also has some wonderful moments of pure comedy. I laughed so hard I fell off the couch! This is the first movie in which I really liked Nicholson's character. He's a bit of an idiot to start but I really warmed up to the old guy. To boot, Keanu looked great in this flick and he finally seems to be shedding the whole ""WOW"" look from those great ""Bill and Ted"" movies. Not to mention the movie, the set was also marvelous. I wish I could have the entire thing shipped up to me. It was beautiful and the setting really did add to the entire movie.

103,lhhung_himself,Hollywood at its bumbling worst...,3,6 January 2008,"These people have huge budgets, access to the best acting, directorial and writing talent but somehow consistently manage to come up with absolutely beautifully shot crap.Here we have your simple love story between two opposites that fall for each other and the bad boy versus the nice guy thats good for you. Aim it at the older female market by mirroring the trendiness of younger men older women relationships and by making a dig at the husbands who abandoned them for young aerobics instructors. Sounds great on paper, good niche market, easy formula to follow, how could you mess this up? Here's how: 1) Actor self indulgence: Diane Keaton is the worst offender (you would think it would be Nicholson) but her interminable wailing was neither funny nor affecting just completely stomach turning.2) Lazy scripting. A plot done a billion times but still can't be bothered to do it right. There is no chemistry between Nicholson and Keaton. The connection between the two is so fake because there is nothing in the plot to develop how they overcome their understandable distaste for each other. Also the Reeves and Peet characters seemed to be complete afterthoughts. It's apparent that the writer had no idea why any younger person would want to hook up with someone older except from what they've read in Cosmo.3) Studio cowardice. Happens all the time. The ending is terrible. I think some exec thought it would make a more upbeat ending and hedge the risk in the ""edginess"" of the plot to make it more acceptable for the little middle-aged man in Peoria...So unless you're looking for something to critique for a film course or you really want to see Jack Nicholson's butt or Diane Keaton's breasts, go for something better like ""As good as it gets"" or ""I could never be your woman"" if you want romantic comedy.",Something's Gotta Give
104,tomrito,Very funny movie but for a mature audience,9,22 December 2003,"This is a very funny movie but I am afraid it is entertainment for a mature audience.  I am sorry but I don't think that young people will appreciate how funny Diane Keaton is when she starts crying all the time, even when she puts on a pair of reading glasses that belong to Jack.  This movie is about adult relationships, and I am being kind here because people over 60 are really old.  But the acting is excellent, by everyone.  Keaton is the best, but Jack Nicholson, again holds his own and Keanu Reeves proves once again that he is more then just a pretty face.  But every time Frances McDormand is on the screen she lights up the film, what a great actress. This is a really good film but it is for a mature audience. If you feel you don't fit the bill, and there is nothing wrong with that, go see something else.",Something's Gotta Give

106,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Something not so worthwhile,8,12 October 2004,"""Something's Gotta Give"", I thoroughly found throughout, has its heights of enjoyment and interest, fitting the bill quite pleasantly in the romantic comedy genre. Yet, somewhere along the line, it seems to lose its class and charm and becomes absorbed in sentimentality and guidance for how to survive getting duped out of love. The relationship between Nicholson and Keaton, peculiar in many ways but still absorbing and often delightful, is quite tentative and leaves much to be desired in its absence throughout the doldrums of the never-ending ""conclusion"". If you're into watching Diane Keaton weep hysterically over a several week fling with Jack Nicholson, then you might actually enjoy the abovesaid drama I have mentioned towards the end. I can fully understand the convenient message behind this romantic comedy: lost, confused souls rediscover love through compatibility and relations, and that is perfectly well received. Yet, being a strange story to begin with: Nicholson being a ""playboy"" womanizer of 20 year-olds and Keaton,losing the will to love again, being caressed by thirty-something Keanu Reeves, the two stumbling upon one another and managing to connect and rekindle their long-lost affections. It just becomes quite incredible, silly, and almost lamentable, that by the end of the film, the two are so torn apart from one another, and must eventually reunite, or else they will inevitably... live the way they lived a few weeks before their ""life-altering"" acquaintance. Call me a skeptic for emotional connections, but a few short weeks and a few memorable, hearty involvements wouldn't have me lamenting the passing of a relationship several months after it was disbanded. However, the scenario of Keaton lending this amusing tale to the screen is passable, since writers tend to digress about their experiences in constructing their ideas in writing. There is much to appreciate here, some delightful dialogue and enchanting music here and there, but there's not much value in the department of substance or even credibility, if you dissent with the concept of ""love at first sight"" means ""love to last a lifetime"". Something is definitely amiss in this Nicholson-Keaton romantic outing. ** out of ****",Something's Gotta Give
107,pri_e,entertaining,7,8 January 2004,"This movie took me by surprise, I wasn't sure if I could handle watching old actors getting it on but this movie turned out to be a great romantic comedy.

It would have been nice to see more input from Frances McDormand and Keanu Reeves, but otherwise I really enjoyed the movie.",Something's Gotta Give
108,native_girl333,Love comes to those who believe it,10,23 June 2006,"Even if I am a fairly young compared to the characters on the film it was incredibly nice for a change to see a movie about 50 something people who find love at old days.Erica Barry (Diane Keaton) is a celebrated theater author who is in her mid-fifties, has divorced a couple of years backwards and she is more beautiful than ever in her life. She's enjoying her life but after her daughter Marin (always perky Amanda Peet) brings her new boyfriend at Ericas summerhouse in Sagaponack her life becomes a ferris wheel.There is not anything bad your daughter to have a boyfriend but when the boyfriend is older than you alarm clocks starts to ring. Marin's boyfriend is 63-year-old music executive Harry Sanborn (legendary Jack Nicholson). The set is very delicious indeed.After Harry suffers from a heart attack Erica meets a new suitor, charming young doctor Julian Mercer (always charming Keanu Reeves). Suddenly the tables have turned. Erica could not bare her only daughter to date a man who is old enough to be her father and herself is getting caught up the affection of our charismatic young doctor.Erica is kind enough to accommodate the recovering patient to her house despite the fact that she can't stand him. You may guess the rest.Even if the story is somewhat told a dozen times before it is still fresh and the theme of mixing the young and the old is very much appealing.Diane Keaton makes a strong lead by playing Erica who thought she had all things that life can give you. Jack Nicholson is funny and as firm as always; perfect match to play the aging playboy. These two form a heart-strong unite that'll make you squirm in your chair! ""Something's Gotta Give"" suits everybody. You can be young or old, poor or rich. If you have a heart it will make you follow.",Something's Gotta Give
109,gottogorunning,Excellent Romantic Comedy,8,18 August 2005,"Get dramatically landlocked. I was happily trapped for the duration, glued to this tale and literally slapped with a light laugh a minute. Full speed ""maximum-strength"" Nicholson, he gets to run through all the gears. Cast as the character most love him as, ladies man extraordinaire. All the characters gel beautifully. Well written and acted, spawning thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Characters who reveal themselves to the viewer in such a measured way we truly seem to understand a part of them. Then they are shaken up and mixed several different ways, so that their bold and unpredictable reactions, are both expected and unexpected. The special attribute this movie has above others like it, is it's ability to skirt complication. Equipped with the ability to lay on a very meaty dramatic interlude with light ingredients.",Something's Gotta Give
110,shimenpf,"Tender, sweet and definitely entertaining",7,10 November 2019,"Something's Gotta Give dares to get out of the average Hollywood formula of having two beautiful 25-year-olds fall in love, and succeeds in doing it. Te characters are fascinating, each with their significant flaw but with qualities that work creating empathy for the audience. The conflict is pretty solid, specially for a romcom. Keanu Reeve's character makes for a great antagonist, one that is not evil, but who's interests end up colliding with Harry's. The internal journey of both protagonists is very solid and easy to follow. I would argue the pace of the film gets a little slower passed the midpoint, and the climax could've certainly demanded a little more active Harry, with more obstacles thrown his way before the final scene. Still, the movie keeps te conflict flowing and provides for a nice story that's worth the watch.",Something's Gotta Give
111,plutus1947,Another one for the DVD Library,8,30 October 2004,"Although I have not seen all of Nicholson's films, in my opinion this is the best from him since Cuckoo's Nest.He and Diane Keaton complimented each other perfectly. Nicholson with his usual lecherous ways and Keaton as the neurotic woman. A part I think she plays so well.I loved the way Erica transformed from a neurotic to a woman well capable of looking after herself (with Harry's help (or lack of it)) and Harry from the aging man about town to a man besotted by Erica.The film script itself was not the best I will ever experience but the acting from all concerned made this film very watchable.As soon as you thought Harry and Erica were going to get it together for keeps, something happened to change your mind and although I was convinced things would work out between them, I was never sure.I am more than happy to give it 8/10",Something's Gotta Give
112,miro-6,A movie for old people,5,18 December 2003,"Good script, less good direction, this movie without Jack Nicholson should be a disaster. The first half an hour is enough funny, after it becomes pathetic. The only purpose of Nancy Meyers, the 55 years old director, is to push us to understand that a 55 years old woman is in the best charming moment of her life. So a 60 year old successful bachelor (J. Nicholson)and a young handsome  physician (K. Reeves) fall in love for her. Unfortunately Diane Keaton did not do any surgery or any botox and looks 70 years old, making not believable at all this story. I wish Nancy Meyers a great success with men as she dreams but I have to say that her movies can be appreciated just by old people and this particular one is a little bit out of reality. And more Diane Keaton is not Sharon Stone.",Something's Gotta Give
113,kellyadmirer,"Film, thy name is Chick Flick!",6,13 December 2003,"I have a very strong feeling that the audience for this weeper is going to sway heavily female and older. Haven't looked at the breakdown, but with some films, you just don't have to.Jack Nicholson absolutely saves this picture. He is no longer the Jack of Terms of Endearment, looking a bit older and more tired with each picture, but nobody mugs for the camera better than he does. Given a nothing scene that goes nowhere, Jack will grab Diane Keaton's bottom or do something funny with his hands or grimace in just that way of his and manage to make the audience laugh. The audience at my showing consistently laughed at his antics even when he wasn't trying to be funny, it was as if they were in on the joke with him. Once in a while he does overdo it and looks like he's straining to create something, but his batting average is terrific.Diane Keaton overacts and overacts and overacts. She doesn't just get upset, she wails and wails and wails - but still manages, while wailing, to type perfect sentences on her laptop. Could the woman have possibly played this role more over the top as the initially-resistant-but-heart-melts-and-falls-insanely-in-love stereotype? I was not impressed. With her few prominent film roles of recent years, it is easy to start comparing this to Annie Hall and find a lot lacking in her performance here.Keanu Reeves picked up a nice check for this film, I'm sure, but anyone could have played his role as Keaton's admirer. Only at a few times toward the end, when he shows some understanding of the Nicholson character's plight, does Keanu come off as anything other than a romantic novel stereotype. Amanda Peet is one of my faves and she starts off with a bang in her role, but that promising start ends with a very obvious and fairly dull whimper.I thought the screenplay was terrible. It started off well, then tailed off into clichés (the writer in the film writes about her own life, which alters her own life when it comes out and is a big success, how original). Then, it bottoms out with obvious tripe about lovers getting cold feet and then regretting their cold feet and then going through all sorts of antics to win back their lost love. I don't understand why Jack chose to make this pedestrian script over the hundreds he must be offered, except that it gives him an opportunity to exercise his acting chops. I enjoyed the set-up and the initial seduction, but the movie would have been better off ending there even if that made it just a short. Less is more, and here much less would have been much more.If you want to know what I mean about descending into cliché, and without giving too much away, picture this scene: lover seeks out old flame, starts rekindling the sparks, then finds out old flame is on the verge of being proposed to by someone else. What does the lover do? Well, if you guessed ""find a romantic bridge to stare off of at night with the snow falling and look really sad,"" you win the prize. If you are really clever, you will figure out how that scene absolutely has to end in the romantic novel universe, because that's the way it does here. Not every film has to be entirely original, but please, spare me Screen writing 101 clichés!I will note that I am not in the target audience for this, not being an older woman, and that the audience at my screening laughed a lot and bought into the clichés and all the ridiculous weepy stuff. There was some audience clapping at the end. I did not clap, but I did laugh at Jack, and the females around me were very affected by the romantic scenes. I did enjoy Nicholson's performance and felt it redeemed the film somewhat. So, I give this a qualified recommendation reserved for those interested in this type of film or who are big Nicholson fans.",Something's Gotta Give
114,Denver53,"Becomes too much of a ""chick movie""",5,3 June 2004,"I like Jack Nicholson a lot. And I like clever dialogue. And both are in ""Something's Gotta Give.""But at some point the movie becomes focused on Diane Keaton's character and her goofy reactions to being in love and not knowing what to do to get over it. She makes faces and noises and seems frustrated and then sad. It was as if the film was asking us to think this is somehow significant. The truth is, getting in and out of a relationship can be emotionally draining. That's how it works. All the camera mugging in the world doesn't make it any cuter. Move on already.The movie also makes the common mistake of claiming men who are older and distinguished and can date much younger women, while women who are older are just old. It conveniently forgets that out-of-shape, average earning older men don't get the 20-something girlfriend. That requires money, power, and reasonably good looks, or some combination. An older woman with the same can also date a younger man ... as the movie then shows, though it doesn't seem to be outraged by that as it is when it comes to men doing it.(Mild spoiler ahead) The ending is especially a letdown, because it is so conventional. Nicholson's character becomes what I suppose most women think a man his age should be, right down to being a doting grandparent (sort of). The movie was much more interesting when he was being who he had always been, which was different than convention. Why change at age 63? I guess to give viewers the warm and fuzzies.

I saw it last night and was absolutely amazed at how sexy and talented Dianne Keaton still is (and probably always will be). I'm not usually a HUGE fan of Jack Nicholson's work but when I sat through this show I laughed so hard. He was ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. Both young and old will enjoy this show. It shows the humor of how the young look at how ""old people"" 'get together' and the humor that the older folks get in the aging process. Keaton shouldn't change. She looked great! And Jack was charming. Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves also added that extra touch that made this romantic comedy perfect. The only problem I found was I think it should've been rated R. I was pretty surprised when Keaton ran out naked and it was only rated PG-13. But hey, if you don't care about nudity or whatnot, go and see it! I plan on seeing it again.

118,Nobody-27,Could have been much better than it was...,6,18 December 2010,"I stumbled upon this film by accident while surfing TV channels, knowing next to nothing about it. The all star cast and great dialogues at the start of the film got my attention immediately.However, as the film progressed it got more and more involved in unimportant detail and making sure that we ""get it"". Some scenes became so painfully long and unreal that commercial brakes actually helped me watch it to the end.One such scene is when Erica, played wonderfully well by Diane Keaton, gets into a crying rage which was about as distracting as the crying scene in ""Up In The Air"", albeit for a different reason... A perfectionist woman like Erica would be more likely to hide her emotions even from herself, while bursting at seams and thinking that no one is noticing.Similarly many other scenes seemed forced. This all leads to a convoluted second half of the film where Harry may or may not be in love with Erica, and where Erica may or may not love him or maybe even hates Harry. It made the film about 30 minutes too long and even worse, it diluted the strength of its characters and story in those lengthy moments of awkwardness. I had a feeling that if many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, it would be a much better film. Less would be more in this case.",Something's Gotta Give
119,Paddy-49,Why do we care about these characters...???,3,29 April 2004,"My problem with ""Something's Gotta Give"" is that I found the characters so unsympathetic and couldn't really care about them. Rich folks with every privilege are full of angst and insecurity. Was the message that money doesn't bring happiness? I don't know but if it was it's a pretty trite theme. I think that we were meant to relate to the film just because the stars are appealing. And I have no problem (of course) with Nicholson and Keaton. The looked good and performed as we would expect from two genuine professionals. But the story was so awful and the setting so inconsequential that I was lost to know what the movie was supposed to mean. That you can have love/lust in your fifties and sixties is hardly an original discovery. That it is possible to look great (as DK does) when you are 56 is a good message for those of us who are 56!

The acting is superb and the multiple clips shown in trailers and on talk shows don't spoil the movie at all as many do these days. Dianne Keaton is at her best turning a performance that in my book tops that of her Academy Award winning role in Annie Hall.

There were some funny moments in this somewhat boring story of an aging bachelor who only dates younger women falling in love with his girlfriends mother. Diane Keaton plays the love interest and in my eyes, is not worthy of any Oscar nominations. Nicholson plays the Bachelor and basically plays the same character we have seen in other movies.Problem with this movie is one moment they hate each other and the next moment they are falling in love. And than there is another 60 minutes to go in the film. Keanu Reeves serves no purpose to this film. We could have had the whole story minus Keaton and Reeves character hooking up.

126,mbworm,A Surprise Guilty Pleasure,8,5 January 2008,"Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are a match made in heaven in this delicious romantic comedy from the queen of chick flicks Nancy Meyers. A well deserved Oscar nomination went to Keaton as an uptight but lovable and charming playwright in her sixties vacationing in her beach house in upstate NY. Along comes Nicholson, who fits into his role so perfectly you can't help but wonder why he didn't get an Academy nod as well. He's Harry Sanbourne, the same age as Erica Barry (Keaton) and he's a famous player in the music industry. When he and his girlfriend Marron, Erica's daughter, (a bubbly Amanda Peet), he and Erica cross paths after a mix-up in which they all end up at the beach house on the same weekend, what starts as a hilarious personality clash becomes an intimate and often hilarious and touching romance. After a heart attack, Harry is forced to stay under Erica's care at the beach house while Marron goes back to work... leaving them alone and at risk of falling inevitably for each other. The story works incredibly well, and it's refreshing to see Keaton and Nicholson at their ages in roles that aren't clichéd and in a romance story that is upbeat, original, sometimes over the top but completely believable and heartwarming. The two have such an intense chemistry you can't help but submit your full attention to their comic tale. Also making for a delightful background story are Frances McDormand as Erica's eccentric and scene-stealing sister, and Keanu Reeves as a younger doctor who gets his heart set on Erica after meeting. But Keaton and Nicholson really elevate and make the show. Like all of Meyer's movies, it just tends to get a little too long and repetitive but it's still full of enormous heart and it's all painfully funny.

128,drunken_critic,Jack rules,9,3 April 2005,"This is a movie where I get a chance to see a great actor practice his craft. America moviegoers will be talking about and admiring Jack Nicholson long after he and I am dead. This movie also stars Diane Keaton, who starred in the classic Annie Hall, but don't ask me what other movies because I don't know.This movie makes me think about the old man and young lady romance. I don't understand why ladies would complain about a situation that they cause. It starts in Middle School. The 8th grade girl dates the high school boy. It continues on in High School. All the hot girls in High School at my High School had college boyfriends. Guess what?? In college it's the same old stuff. You have college girls that are dating guys that have homes and high paying jobs. Well guess what?? These women deserve to be traded in for younger women in the future. Forget 'em! I don't want to hear how unfair it is. I would feel sorry if most women dated guys there own age, but the reality is that they usually date older men. When they get old, they should be traded in like an old car.Oh yeah, the movie was pretty good. It attempted to add a twist of a younger man dating a much older woman. It happens, but it is rare. Ironically the women ends up settling for the older man in the end. Ha ha, she falls into the same pattern! I give this movie a 9/10 because it has one of the greatest actor ever.",Something's Gotta Give

The story is trite and predictable, the characters are unsympathetic wealthy people with wealthy people's problems. Many critics have claimed this film is elevated by its stars, but I don't buy it. Neither Nicholson nor Keaton is acting in any sense other than playing themselves. They obviously had a good time on the set, and several scenes do sparkle with the humor and freshness of friends having a good time. But it's like watching a party at someone else's house. I wasn't engaged in a believable story, and I wasn't having a good time. What does the daughter -- or the mother -- see in Nicholson's lecherous character? What does Nicholson's character -- or Reeves' character -- see in Keaton's flighty la-de-da ""Annie Hall"" reprisal? I couldn't tell.",Something's Gotta Give

Movie reminded me As good as it gets and thought how come I haven't seen this before.But then right after she begins writing a play with every single detail about their private moments blow by blow (too much for being influenced by real events), and Nicholson's weird decisions, movie lost its potential. Also making the guy miserable should have been handled much better. And Keanu Reeves? Seriously!?Some stories begins slow or boring but later you realize it's a build up for something better and you leave happy.

I thought this film was ""cute"", but only gave it a ""5"" overall.  Jack Nicholson was consistent, always delivering his comedic lines right on, but, in my opinion, Diane Keaton was too much.  She did the same mannerisms over and over again and I could SEE the acting taking place. Francis Mc Dormand was miscast and I do no think that she should not waste her considerable talents on bit parts like this.  The actor no one seems to mention is Keanu and I must say, he glowed.

He was always so amazing as intriguing, odd characters. One Flew..., The Shining, Five Easy Pieces, The Passenger, Witches of Eastwick...Something's.. is not a film to watch if you want to see Nicholson shine. He will always be a great actor in my eyes, but he was wasted in this film. None of his quirky qualities, oddball behaviour, or intriguing Jackness were given space to shine in this hollow shell of a movie.This movie tries so hard to please the audience, is racked with clichés and is, quite frankly, embarrassing for all involved.The crying scene is indeed embarrassing and way too over the top. The Paris sequence is so so so cliché, and the bridge over the river Seine ending... wow. how cliché can you get?Sure, some of the scenes were OK. Keanu wasn't as wooden as I've seen him in previous attempts at acting, but he still gave me splinters. Somebody else said this was the performance of Keaton's career. Annie Hall, anyone? Not only is AH a great performance, but a great film; far far far better than this one. I appreciate that the filmmaker is trying to give kudos to older people falling in love and admitting your age and not constantly chasing people over half your age, but it's very heavy handed and uninteresting. Forgettable. Paint by numbers. What more can I say. Although, in the movie's defense, I was into it until about halfway through the film. Not thinking that it was a brilliant film, but some of the comedic sequences were funny. Until it fell on its face. Then the film fell to bits.. and yes, seemed to never end.ever.but then it did.

Marin tells her mother in the kitchen.""Why?

138,doctorow,A disappointment,5,13 December 2003,"A poorly scripted movie with a few amusing moments.  The lead actors wasted their talents on this piece.  The script had all the markings of an eighth grade romance drama with humor awkwardly worked in to provide comic relief. Nicholson sleepwalks his way through this one.  Diane Keaton is a fine actress..but the character and script do not do her justice.  She gamely attempts to make her character come alive, but barely succeeds. A money making potboiler from Hollywood.  I would not recommend this movie, unless  you only attend movies once or twice every two years.

But friends told me this one is different--it's fresh, it's funny, it's different.   Well, it's not.  Nicholson is Nicholson, only more so.  The other actors are OK, but they get pushed out of Nicholson's huge ego.  The story is inane and boring.  Some of the scenes involving Nicholson's anatomy are disgusting.  The ending is as implausible as it is predictable.  Yep, hard to believe you could come up with something both implausible and predictable, but once you buy into the bizarre premise that (spoilers ahead) Amanda Peet is hot for Nicholson's flabby body, and that Diane Keeton would give Nicholson a second thought after Keanu Reeves puts the moves on her, then you'll believe anything.  Worse than how Nicholson looks is the utterly despicable and self-centered character he plays.

It is however an unfortunate indictment of the director's storytelling skills that they are virtually all packed into the first 30 minutes of what feels like a four-hour film.  The rest is schmaltzy, over-sentimental drivel, broken up only by intermittent rays of light provided by Jack Nicholson and, to a lesser extent, Keanu Reeves.Diane Keaton is hideously miscast, although she is not helped by her character being wafer thin - are we supposed to believe Erica is a top playwright when she displays such little understanding of life and love? Frances McDormand is criminally underused, although by the end you have the feeling that her main scene could have been in a different film.The plot is turned several times too many (if you thought Return of the King had too many false endings, try this on for size) but always to the inevitable conclusion.4/10, with all points being scored in the first quarter by Jack Nicholson.",Something's Gotta Give

Yet deep-down everyone knows that it's all just a temporary illusion.But when angry aging feminists want to believe that they are still attractive to younger men, they write/direct/star in/support movies like 2003's, ' S.G.t.G.

However, it had some pretty major flaws, in my opinion. For one thing, there are millions of people who wouldn't find the depictions of heart attacks and panic attacks (masquerading as heart attacks)all that amusing. Of course, the younger people in the theater found all that hilarious. It obviously depends on your perspective.My wife thought the actors (particularly Nicholson and Keaton) were mugging into the camera from time to time. Personally, I think Nicholson should go back and study his performance in ""About Schmidt"" to see the proper way to play a part.We both thought Keaton looked way too old to play a 56-year old, and I was amazed to then learn that that's her age!

148,fha-2,"A Funny, Poignant Tale For All",9,12 December 2003,"Academy Award® winners Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton and Frances McDormand star with Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet in a sophisticated romantic comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, The Parent Trap). Picture an aging, 63 year-old Lothario, Harry (Jack Nicholson) with a libido much younger than his years and his sweet young plaything, Marin (Amanda Peet), on a weekend trip to Marin's parents beach house for a romantic getaway weekend.  Just before their weekend begins, Marin's mom, Erica (Diana Keaton), a successful playwright, and her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) arrive unexpectedly to spoil their weekend.  After polite urgings by Marin's mother and sister, Harry reluctantly decides to spend the weekend with the entire entourage.  During dinner, Harry shares his passion for dating younger women and that he would never date women his own age. Reluctantly, Erica and her sister more or less accept what is happening and begrudgingly accept the amorous goings on around them.Marin and Harry start kissing in the other room and Harry passes out from a heart attack.  Harry is then rushed to the hospital.  Dr. Julian ( Keanu Reeves) tells Harry that he has to stay off his feet and cannot go back to his home in the City until he has improved.  Julian then suggests that Harry spends a week at Erica's home until he is well enough to travel back to the City.  Harry and Erica express some reservations, however, Erica and Harry soon find out they are really not so different from each other after all, developing a special relationship and bond together.  Once she accepts her situation, she opens up an emotional reservoir within her that affects her more deeply than anything has in years.  Harry becomes open to appreciating the appeal of women his own age.  As they become more at ease with one another, the dialogue between them becomes crisp, fresh, and revealing of their intimate personas.At about the very same time, Harry's 36 year-old charming doctor (Keanu Reeves) makes a play for Erica, while Harry attempts to seduce Erica with his own fading charms.  Erica, caught in the middle, is amazed at all the attention placed on her.  It is unfortunate that the chemistry between Harry and Erica is not quite as believable and intimate as it seems to be between Erica and Julian, the young thirty-some doctor.  I can easily overlook this minor flaw and simply chalk it up to Jack Nicholson's personal lack of ability to deeply connect to a mature woman other than sexually.`Something's Gotta Give' is well crafted with humor, poignancy, and drama. The laughs will keep you rolling in the aisles.  The script is smart, fresh, and sophisticated.  Jack Nicholson proves once again that he is a superb actor and can play most any type of character flawlessly.  Praise is also due to Diane Keaton, portraying probably her best role in years as a delightfully sweet overworked play write.  Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, and Amanda Peet create perfect supporting roles and are each played with exceptional panache and style.Accolades are also well deserved for writer/director Nancy Meyers for attempting to challenge the system by making Harry's object of desire a 57 year-old woman.  One does not see enough of that sort of thing these days. This is a film that is juicy from its very first bite and maintains its flavor throughout.The movie may be a bit predictable at times, however the script was brisk, refreshing, and funny while maintaining just the right mix of comedy and drama.

149,TexVanWinkle,Love in the afternoon,8,7 December 2003,"A smart and often very funny movie about love on the back nine of life. It's different than the love of youth, and better, I think: The romance is just as sweet, but richer, with a lifetime of experience swirled around in it.This is a thoughtful and--not a word I'd usually use, but perfect in this case--delightful movie.  Jack is indeed his own type, as the movie makes note, which makes this a role seemingly written for him, playing a legendary Lothario forced to consider what he's missed and missing in such a life. A gutsy role for Nicholson, if you think about it, but because he's Jack, you don't.  (Well, until later, obviously.)Diane Keaton's always been a background actress for me, someone who's always done good to great work, but whose films and roles have never resonated in memory for me.  This one I'll remember.  For me it's her best. Her candor onscreen is so real at times it's startling; she seems less to be acting than being caught on film.In the supporting roles, Amanda Peet continues to get better--check out Igby Goes Down for more evidence--and, because I'm a guy, prettier as well. The only false note, not surprisingly, is Keanu Reeves, whose casting is an absolute mystery to me.  And as a doctor no less; Joey's Drake Remoray on Friends seems more real.  I just don't get how with so many actually good (and more handsome, for that matter) actors available--Ted?  The fact that he continues to be cast in roles that require him to emote just further convinces me he's a modern Rasputin.It's a small price to pay, though.  This one's worth evening price.

150,hamass-mujadid,Physically Flimsy v Mentally Flimsy Makes the Sturdiest Concept Ever,8,1 June 2015,"A classy beach drive, prefacing the buoyancy of the whole mind-map. A quick background to the very next scene—affluent mom and her beach house, and the daughter's utilization of resources at her absence, not for herself, but for a 63 year old Harry Sanborn—cigar-puffing magnate, who also assumes to be a playboy, quite favorably so. She strips down, while Harry isn't allowed to smoke another one—it's Marin's mother's house, and she wouldn't like that. But she wouldn't mind Marin making-out with a 63 year-old heart patient. Turns out, she doesn't. Well she does look surprised, but the awkwardness of the moment withers away with the awkwardness of the self—mother's kinky attitude towards Harry seems nerving to the seesaw couple. A couple of misogynistic lessons, and apparently, the true ""self"" comes out. But with all the Jack n Jill going on, it's ultimately Sex n Pill which save the day.Viagra, Sanborn-buttocks, turtle-neck-kinda-gal, I-was-going-to-the-kitchen, walk at the beach, and hence, the story moves on. Jack Nicholson is au courant, and upmarket as ever before, but Diane Keaton delivers something truly terrific. Movie aside, she delivers a very important message: age and looks do not go adjoined. Her Erica's is wine-like sophisticated, strong yet fragile, wordy yet sensuous, and most of all, intrinsically leaned towards exploration—the kind that doesn't get frank at a moment's notice, but longs for an eye-to-eye connection to render the purest ""self."" And that's where Jack's eyes take the lead. Guy has something going on in his skin, probably some kind of a genetic experiment (Sorry, not a science guy.) He takes off with Diane to tune into a magnificent, heart-melting story of two people over-the-rope for this kind of stuff—love and the love-making.Nancy Meyers shoots it into the sky with exquisite, happy-go-lucky script—it's colloquial, tragic, strenuous, and vividly sentimental. Their first cry in the bed, their wrapping-around-arms, and eventually, ""You are a woman to love,"" is everything that's needed. It sort of completes Erica's biopic. Nancy would definitely have failed if it were not for Jack's gaudily command over expressions and intonation together with Diane's more-then-absolute fitting into the role. With that, Meyer's comical incorporates a different kind of sexy. Honestly, nothing would have rendered appreciating feedback had it not been for Diane's inner-self smile, and Jack's apparently self-regulating but internally contingent upon heartfelt emotions from another state of being, and this is the underlying truth behind Diane Sawyer's ex-fiancé, who has had more than 40 years of ""playboy"" experience. Because when I think of the storyline only, and not the lead cast, except for a few puns, I'd kill myself halfway through the movie.Somewhere amidst the epic touchiness of the whole concept, a dull and boring ending arrived, which I expected to be the most unlikely. Sure I could figure it had to be Paris, but it was just mundane. I'm not talking about performances here; I'm talking about execution. And from what I saw, Nancy wasn't aware of the credibility of her idea, and probably went easy on herself, maybe a little too easy.Now, the legendary wrecker—Keanu Reeves. What is with that guy? He's sort of satisfactory, and sort of lame. Why does he always fail to impress me? I could say that he was the only flaw in the story—even the character he played. It lacked purpose throughout. The movie would have sailed through effortlessly even without him. Alone lady, alone celebration, and alone trip to Paris. What's wrong with that? So that was the only major flaw in the storyline.From the screen, Something's Gotta Give is literally a journey halfway through the world, not just to and from countries, but individuals, and hearts, and minds of people in those countries. At the end of it all, it's still people, and it's still a movie, because Louis Armstrong's La Vie en Rose, Erica's much-loved Jazz song, translates something like this: life through rose-colored glasses. And that's about it—Paris, superficiality, and everything nice hurries away in no time.",Something's Gotta Give

Diane Keaton looks GREAT and dominates the screen whenever she is on it. Jack Nicholson, for the first time in what seems to be decades, inhabits a role instead of simply doing a riff on himself. Supporting players (McDormond, Reeves, Peet)are quite good in keeping the story going. The locations in the Hamptons and New York City (or whatever was used for them) give you a real sense of time, place and class--the characters are unabashedly wealthy people who live very well in ten room beach houses, zillion dollar townhouses and sprawling co-ops.",Something's Gotta Give

155,pensive_englishman,Worst show by Reeves,2,19 June 2020,"What a waste to spend a whole evening watching this boring, ridiculous, illogical, outlandish and above all, vain film. To be honest I wasn't quite sure whether it was the right type of movies 🎥 I wanted to watch as I'm not a comedy person after all. I only opted to watch it because I didn't have better films on air tonight and there were a few A-listers in it. I much prefer war movies 🎥 such as Saving Private Ryan or Fury as they are much more real. Or some soul searching movies 🎥 such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) would really tap into my heart. With comedies you laugh your head off and then you go - you barely remember a single thing afterwards, just as what happens in THIS movie - after sex people forget everything.
The movie 🎥 has extremely incongruous plot, something that goes against average people's understanding, belief, imagination and expectations. A successful businessman and sugar daddy (the old man) dates a woman 20 years younger. Fine! That does happen in real life. And then he meets the woman's mother a playwright (the old woman) who is at his age. And chemistry sparks. So it ends up the businessman having sex with the playwright after the daughter realizes the old man isn't her fit and instead a much better fit for her mother. Well I can reluctantly accept that. What gets more ridiculous is that a young male doctor (young man) is deeply attracted to the old woman and walks into her life when she has a troubled relationship with the businessman. While I don't tend to preempt what people should or should not do in their personal choice, it is highly and extremely at odds with reality. How can a young man have attraction for an old woman who is at his mother's age? Do you really believe the romance between the French President and the French First Lady has a regular occurrence in everyday life?
What I don't agree with even further is that the old woman accepts the young man's dating just to fill her emotional vacuum after suffering a relationship setback with the old man simply because the old man dates another young woman at the same time. It gets extremely whimsical at this point. You blame the other person for their infidelity but you do the same thing. Why point your finger at others while you are not that innocent? Maybe that's reality. Maybe that's what life is like. But I don't buy into this plot. In a dramatic ending the young man abruptly bows out as he realizes the old woman still has a heart for the old man. Is love really such an easy game to play, as is sung in Beetles' Yesterday?
As for the cast Diane Keaton is extremely attractive and holds herself really well at her age. I can see she is very charming but probably not relevant for men 2 decades younger than her. As for Keanu Reeves, first seeing him on Speed (1994) with Sandra Bullock I realized he had extremely appealing look, one that probably matches those of Tom Cruise 🚢 and Brad Pitt. However, after hearing some woman says he's nothing but for his handsome face I somehow feel obliged to agree. He does not seem to possess the same level of acting skills as his A-listed peers.
The only good thing I can say about this movie 🎥 is that the music and background are gentle, soft and beautiful which represent a good match with the theme. New York City and Paris are all too familiar which bring back my pre-pandemic trips and memories.
Overall I can only give it 2 out of 10. I honestly haven't rated a movie 🎥 this low, not for the ones I have written a formal review for, to say the least.",Something's Gotta Give

I was happily trapped for the duration, glued to this tale and literally slapped with a light laugh a minute. Full speed ""maximum-strength"" Nicholson, he gets to run through all the gears. Cast as the character most love him as, ladies man extraordinaire. All the characters gel beautifully. Well written and acted, spawning thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Characters who reveal themselves to the viewer in such a measured way we truly seem to understand a part of them. Then they are shaken up and mixed several different ways, so that their bold and unpredictable reactions, are both expected and unexpected. The special attribute this movie has above others like it, is it's ability to skirt complication. Equipped with the ability to lay on a very meaty dramatic interlude with light ingredients.

157,LeslieLLKing,Something's Gotta Give - Gives Love and Laughs,8,20 February 2006,"Something's Gotta Give  Gives Love and Laughs Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) the no-ties, younger ladies man, casually dates a classy, New York, Southampton, twenty-something, woman named, Marin Barry, (Amanda Peet), daughter to notable play write, Erica Jane Barry (Diane Keaton). When Erica seeks time away at the family's Southampton retreat, little does she know that she will find her daughter, Marin accompanied by much older boyfriend, Harry. In walks Erica with her sister, Zoe, (Frances McDormand) a funky, spunky, and lovable liberal woman's studies university professor, and in the kitchen is Harry, dressed only in his oxford shirt and underwear, standing in front of the refrigerator, reflecting upon snack food. Erica assumes Harry is a wreck loose on ecstasy, who has taken residence in their posh ocean front retreat. He explains to both ladies, that he is really Marin's boyfriend, and the two are visiting for a getaway weekend. He offers to leave, but Zoe suggests, as all being mature adults, that the four of them simply share their space. The others see her point and agree to it.But when Marvin Gaye's, ""Sexual Healing,"" puts Harry over the edge, into a heart attack, he finds not only his love life, roller coasting, but Erica's too. It's Harry's doctor, the 36 year old, young and virile, Julian (Kenau Reeves) who falls for the mature and successful Erica, twenty years, his senior. Erica makes a place in her heart for both of these men. Torn between two lovers, the only place to find answers it seems, is in her play writing, and even there, she is drawn to what seems to be an endless stream of tears, as she writes her current piece, ""A Woman To Love,"" words that Harry spoke to her, after they slept together.Who will she really choose in persuasion and feelings of the heart? We pretty much can guess the answer, at the beginning of the film, but how she arrives there is rather an interesting and often times amusing journey, as Harry thinks he is having bout after bout of additional heart attacks. Watch ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and realize that in the end, love speaks its own language solely between two people.Diane Keaton is poignant and classy, in her Keaton style way, adapting to two loves at once, although realizing that her heart ultimately favors one over the other. She reminds Marin that discovering love and letting it go, to grow, does not come without tears, sadness, and emotional pain. These emotions are well worth facing, if love is to be found. Amanda Peet, as Miran is just looking for a love to call her own. Realizing the age difference between her and Harry is too vast, she is happy that her mom is making the attempt for true love. Peet's role is fine, but in honesty, a little boring and romantically underdeveloped, for such a bright woman. Frances McDormand, as Zoe is very fun and refreshing and it's unfortunate that her role is so minimal. Kenau Reeves, as Julian, is surprisingly smooth and comfortable throughout his scenes with Keaton. But his ""doctor's voice,"" deep and throaty, seems a little superficial and practiced. Though for his rehearsed vocals, his body language compensates and exceeds itself, in naturalness. For example, his dining scene with Erica and Harry, in Paris is very nice. Very fine Kenau. The sets are fabulous, warm and cozy, and come to life with the actors, who occupy their space.In attempt for art to imitate life, Julian and Erica fly off to Paris to celebrate Erica's Birthday. But will life imitate art? That is the final question in the end? Something's Gotta Give is a well scripted, with a nicely matched cast of characters, a thoroughly enjoyable ride, one that we hope Jack's heart didn't suffer too much!",Something's Gotta Give
158,lawesy-83036,Yes Jack over keanu!,9,8 September 2019,If you read the negative write ups about this movie: they don't get the point of the movie! They are soul mates.

159,doctorx2,A sad waste of talent,3,30 September 2006,"Few major films have conveyed imagery as frightening as the horror of Diane Keaton going through menopause on screen in Something's Gotta Give, a pathetic fantasy written by and for perimenopausal women. The use of a stellar cast misleads unsuspecting audiences into thinking that they will be entertained, challenged, or enlightened by this film. Unfortunately, the plodding and predictable script leads viewers deeper and deeper into despair, as implausible story lines are played out to their tedious conclusion.The film does raise some important questions, however. E.g., why would lovely Amanda Peet ever give nasty old Jack Nicholson the time of day? And more to the point, why would Keanu Reeves' character (the young, brilliant and charming doctor) desire carnal contact with moldy old Diane Keaton? Is this some veiled remake of Harold & Maude? Obviously there is an unresolved Oedipal complex in Keanu's character's life (or perhaps in the screenwriter's). For believability, if they wanted a ""mature"" female lead, go to Diane Lane. She's still got ""it,"" in spades. Perhaps even Annette Benning. Or maybe even Meg Ryan (who should begin to accept the fact that she is beyond ingénue parts). But Diane Keaton frankly looks too old for Keanu Reeves, and the impression is conveyed to the viewer that some kind of Point is being made about women's rights. Why didn't they just use Meryl Streep? At least that would've sent a clear warning out to potential male viewers, fooled by the presence of Jack Nicholson into thinking there was a movie in there somewhere.At any rate, Keaton is not given much to work with, as the sexually insecure and frustrated donna of this soap opera. She is reduced to looking embarrassed or heart-broken most of the time. Keaton is capable of so much more complexity, going all the way back to Looking for Mr. Goodbar and The Godfather. Nicholson fares little better, and one is never sure whether his character is supposed to be smarmy, nasty, or smarmy and nasty. Amanda Peet's character is a unidimensional débutante, who (being young and attractive, and therefore threatening to the intended audience of menopausal middle-aged women) is reduced to the status of a well-intended know-nothing, the naive daughter who has not lived long enough to have developed a real personality. This is a sad waste of talent, and the interested viewer is encouraged to look at some of Peet's meatier roles, in such films as the obscure Digby Goes Down, or even the ludicrous Saving Silverman.If something's gotta give, it's this movie -- spend an evening watching something -- anything -- else.",Something's Gotta Give

It's a cast of famous and oscar winning actors, although Diane Keaton steals the show with her wonderful performance, she deserves her oscar nomination.",Something's Gotta Give
161,shinymc_shine,And Give It Does!,8,30 January 2004,"""Something's Gotta Give"" from writer/producer/director Nancy Meyers is a romantic comedy for an older generation that is a crowd pleaser no matter what your age is. Meyers has a good track record with this genre. Her last movie, ""What Women Want"", was about a relationship between a more mature couple in the world of advertising. In this movie, the two leads are a decade or so older than Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt and again Meyers has created a successful movie that proves the old adage that when it comes to love, age doesn't matter. It's refreshing to see a couple of actors in their autumn years play a romantic duo and not suffer the wrath of any ageist jokes. Hands up all those people who are sick to death of these generic, teenage friendly, Freddie Prinze Jr. starring rom coms.Jack Nicholson, in a part that must have been written especially for him, plays an eternal bachelor who prefers to date younger women under 30. While on a weekend getaway with his current lover he suffers a heart attack and finds himself recuperating at the beach house owned by his girlfriend's mother, played by Diane Keaton. As time goes by these two people, in a confined space, begin to form a friendship. The more time they spend together the more their relationship grows but Nicholson has a rival for Keaton's affection in the form of his doctor played by Keanu Reeves. Reeves knows full well Keaton's work and success as a playwright and is quickly smitten with her at their first meeting. Now Keaton must make the choice between the younger man and the older bachelor.Nicholson is great as always and never puts a foot wrong. I don't think I could recollect a performance that wasn't award worthy. His choices of late, ""Anger Management"", Alexander Payne's ""About Schmidt"" and Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"", have been spot on and have shown a whole emotional range he wasn't capable of when he was young. He is without any doubt in the top 5 of American living actors and if his last four performances are anything to go by, his next projects will be worth the wait. Even though Nicholson is an anti-hero icon of the '70s, his comic timing is perfect.While Nicholson was born to play his character, Keaton has been cast against type. She displays no neurotic behavior, her trademark, like she did in her romantic comedies with Woody Allen. Here she is a good lover/rival for Nicholson and this is probably the most strongest character she's ever played. She has been underused in the ""Father Of The Bride"" franchise and her character in ""The First Wives Club"" started out timid before she becomes independent. This movie is a huge step up for her.Reeves plays a character with alot more depth than usual. He has always been a likeable actor even though some of his performances have been questionable.The cast is rounded out by the always reliable Frances McDormand as Keaton's sister, the charming Amanda Peet as Keaton's daughter and a welcome come back role for ex-""Starsky And Hutch"" star Paul Michael Glaser, who has been directing more than acting of late, playing Keaton's ex-husband. Jon Favreau has a nothing little role as Nicholson's best friend.It's quite alarming in this day and age that characters in romantic comedies still have to be rich and successful, live in huge apartments or houses and dress immaculately. It's a throw back to the American screwball comedies of the '40s and ""50s that due to current trends and attitudes is starting to become old fashioned and irrelevant. What about a movie that has two average middle class characters falling in love?I'd like in know what happened to the scene with Nicholson in the restaurant flaunting his young girlfriend to everyman in the room. It's in the trailer and certainly would've made alot more sense had it been left in the movie. My belief is that it was to be the very first scene and would bookend the last scene set in the same restaurant. I don't want to give the ending away but if you see or remember the trailer keep it in mind when you see the movie.In summation this is an entertaining laughfest with two good actors showing that age is certainly just a state of mind.",Something's Gotta Give

Reeves seemed out of character, but that was perhaps consistent with his role.  For those of us who are Nicholson and Keaton fans, however, this is a movie to savor.

Writer and director Nancy Meyers, has demonstrated an uncanny understanding of the male and female psyche that produced Oscar worthy performances from the featured stars reminiscent of ""Bogart and Bacall"" and ""Tracy and Hepburn"". With an amazing script to work with, Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton have never been this funny, this adorable, and certainly never this believable. It was as if they were not acting and merely living out their every day lives in front of the cameras. ""Old Jack"" reveled in this role and was sensational, but, there are few superlatives to describe Dianne Keatons performance, other than, it was simply astonishing. Her facial expressions,and body language conveyed more to the viewer than any written dialog ever could. Her lines when they were delivered were effortless and Her beauty was so evident for all to see that it was difficult to take your eyes off of her.

It takes about 2 hours, or so it seems, before the chemistry between them explodes and they passionately make love. For some reason it's tender and funny to see these people make love even though their skin's not as tight as it once used to be.After that your basic love-interest-story begins: boy wants girl, girl wants boy, both are insecure, he dates another girl, she gets involved with other man etc.won't reveal the end but it's not a too bad variant of the standard cliché...You walk out the theatre with a good feeling: money well spent and a smile on your face that will last several hours!PS: I had checked out IMDB before I went to the theatre and knew that Jack Nicholson would sing ""La Vie en Rose"": we were the only ones left when the last subtitles disappeared but it's really worth it!!

The film then follows their relationship throughougt, with an almost cameo appearance from Keanu Reeves who still acts like he's just woken up at 2:00 in the morning. (btw, for all i insult keanu's acting, he's one top man, apparently very generous to his stunt men in terms of gifts and also gives immense amounts to charity, hats off to him). But my point is the first half of the film was quite fast paced and funny, i laughed out loud at several bits. And then it decided it would become serious and try and get across a decent meaning, the jokes dried up and it became repetetive, predictable, and boring. Perhaps as an 18 year old bloke being dragged along to a romantic comedy i'm being biased, since my parents loved it.

Now I'm white and 25 and I found that conversation offensive.  I mean seriously we could have done with out the stereotyping.  Nancy (the author) your a 54 year old white female who wrote ""The Parent Trap"", just stick with the comedy quips and the romantic bits that filled the rest of the movie.  I'd say that this movie is very predictable and that crying is WAY OVER DONE.  But if your looking for a romantic comedy that's recent.. this is better than some of the other stuff that's out.

The writing was exceptional, and the acting by everybody was marvelous, especially Nicholson and Keaton.  Wow.  This is definitely in my top 5 movies.

Jack Nicholson projects a rakish charm in his role as the perpetual bachelor who only dates inappropriate, younger women. Diane Keaton is very funny as the middle-aged divorced playwright who can't find a man, and then suddenly she finds two.The movie reminded me very much of a Woody Allen romantic comedy of the 1970s, along the lines of ""Manhattan"" or ""Annie Hall"", but from the woman's point of view, and without Woody Allen's signature bittersweet ending. Instead of a neurotic playwright Alvy Singer or television writer Isaac Davis, we have neurotic playwright Erica Barry. The trajectory of the story follows  similar lines as those comedies, as people fall in love, mess up, break up, and get back together again.  It would work better if it wasn't all so damn slick.

But: the whole story is about as predictable as lights on a Christmas tree and more than just a tad too pat; Frances McDormand and Amanda Peet are unforgivably wasted in grossly underwritten parts while Keanu Reeves, as the young doctor having the hots for Keaton, is his usual bland persona; and at over two hours (!) running time this is grotesquely overlong, as after about 90-100 minutes virtually every comedy, as ""sophisticated"" as it may be, must inevitably run out of steam. Given the fact that at least one complete sequence was cut from the film, it must've seemed even more interminable in its original version. On the whole, a moderately entertaining movie with a few nice one-liners and a few good laughs, the best thing about it being Jack Nicholson rendering Edith Piaf's classic ""La vie en rose"" over the credits, though.",Something's Gotta Give
175,SenoritaTorres,Something different in a rom-com! Loved it!,8,20 February 2007,"PLEASE NOTE, THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS I think we can establish from most of my posts that I am biased, as I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, but let's put that aside for now and I'll comment on how much I truly loved this film. It was so different from other rom-coms I've seen in that it wasn't about two young people falling in love, but two older people who think they're past their prime but find love with each other anyway.Jack is playing himself in this (love it!) as Harry, an ageing casinos with an eye for the younger ladies. Cue much of his eyebrow action, husky voice and killer smile. Diane Keaton is the unimpressed, sarcastic mother of his latest younger girlfriend-and right from the word go the chemistry is sizzling! What I liked about the film is how the relationship between Erica and Harry went from extreme dislike, to disdain, to confusion, sex, and finally true love. You could completely identify with Erica in that she's divorced, has one grown-up daughter and spends her days (and nights) sitting at home writing successful plays but not really doing much else except maybe spending time with her sister. When Harry comes on the scene, once over her initial disgust at a 63-year-old man dating her 29-year-old daughter, she begins to become interested in him, and that's where the fun begins.There are so many hilariously funny moments in this movie, moments where I can truly say I've laughed out loud-particularly the 'I was looking for the bathroom!' 'BACK HERE?!' moment. The interaction between Harry and Erica (and the brilliant acting of Nicholson and Keaton) is both touching and funny throughout the whole movie, and the sexual tension between them is what keeps the film the fabulous film it is. Keanu Reeves makes a great addition as the doctor besotted with Erica.What I loved most about it was the fact I identified so much with Erica. She was in love with this man who just couldn't be in a relationship with her and she was so devastated she spent her days in floods of tears. (the crying scenes were my favourite scenes in the film, I was crying myself with laughter!) but also I was thinking, 'We've all been there.' The magic of this film is its unpredictability. Things happen in which you think that Harry and Erica may not get together, and you end up wondering whether Harry will end up alone. Will he finally accept that he just can't be that picky anymore and go for the woman who he truly wants in his heart but is too proud to admit it? Wonderful film.

And not a Howard Hawks wit, or a ""His Girl Friday"" charm; not a self-propelled 1930s, devil-may-care screwball comedy. No, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is directed with one eye on the audience. It's icily, cynically calculating. And so typical for our time.Supremely well-acted. Impeccable art direction and music scoring. Beach houses in the Hamptons, witty, wealthy, glamorous people, eligible bachelors and lovable rogues.

As if action movies aren't directed at men first and women second.All the actors are great. Especially Diane Keaton. Weird stuff though - I'm an admitted Keanu-holic so I love almost everything he does, but this guy acts his butt off in this movie. He actually has more chemistry with Diane Keaton than Jack Nicholson. It's probably his best performance ever. Nancy Meyer's is a great director for him. Hopefully they'll work together again.At first, I'll admit it, I was kind of squirmy when Keanu Reeves is kissing Diane Keaton but then I told myself that I was a hypocrite and that I was only trained to accept older men w/younger women as a possibility. Once I got over that, I realized that they really clicked. They actually had great chemistry and it left me wanting to see them together again in more scenes. They weren't together enough.The only bad thing is that the ending is so predictable that you know what's going to happen just from the previews alone. It's so out in the open that all the reviews are talking about the ending as if they weren't giving spoiler info - they aren't.Even though this is a movie about an older woman being attractive to a younger man, the ending was a cop-out. It wrapped up to a nice little bow fast - that was actually the unbelievable part. You felt that Diane should have agonized over her decision for longer than it took to take a cab to her hotel back to a bridge. And it would have been refreshing to see her make an opposite choice.Anyhow, it was still great. I like the old-fashioned movies and this was well cast. Not to mention the fantastic acting!

Where did Erika get the cigarette that she lit in the Paris restaurant? She never smoked, nor did either of the men at the table with her. The timelines ran together. Harry found Erika in a Paris restaurant, and then she found him on a bridge over the Seine. Try finding someone in Paris, even if you know EXACTLY where and when to meet them. And, he was ALONE!! No one else in Paris at the time. Let me know if you ever find any place in Paris, at any time, especially on one of the Seine bridges, where there are NO other people. Sad excuse for a film.

The story really picks up when Erica starts dating the doctor played by Keanu Reeves, who kind of kills his part in the film because he is so vacant. He is nowhere near as funny as Jack. Another part that kind of messes up the film for me is when Erica's sister Zoe goes off on a tangent about the dating scene.

It is only that I had the feeling that the movie lasts a little bit too long, but still is not boring. It is a story about two persons in there, shall we say mature age (both over 60). Harry (Nicholson) dates models and good looking, attractive girls, and Erica (Keaton) on the other way is a self- standing and tight women, who is divorced and is now focused on her carrier. As the story goes on, step by step they fall in love... All elements for a good comedy are included- very good performances by Nicholson and Keaton (Reeves is a bit disappointing), a number of hilarious scenes and a story that is quite interesting. Jack Nicholson returns in his all- time role as a irresistible charmer after his performance in About Schmidt. I must mention something elese- the soundtrack is classic for such a movie, but the last song on the CD, La vie an rose is preformed by Jack Nicholson, first in English, then in french.

I have always loved Jack Nicholson's movies, and also Diane Keaton's. The two together after 30 years since ""Reds"" was sweet. I haven't laughed so hard and loud at a romantic movie since ""When Harry Met Sally"". Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet played perfect, young and decidedly uninteresting young upwardly mobile 30 somethings. Both ""perfect catches"" for someone, but not for the seasoned, sexy senior citizens. I laughed 'til I cried. At 63 years of age, and someone who fell in love for the first time at 48 years of age, I can relate. I quote the Paul Simon song, ""You have to learn how to fall, before you can fly"". No truer words have been said.",Something's Gotta Give
194,ctr4etrnty,Predictable Fun,7,4 April 2004,"In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that I love Jack Nicholson. In my world, the man can do no wrong. Even at his worst he is better than most and, when he's firing on all cylinders, he's a thing of beauty. Such is the case with Something's Gotta Give, the witty Nancy Myers rom-com that earned an Oscar nod for co-star Diane Keaton.Nicholson (About Schmidt, Anger Management) is Harry Sandstrom, a 60-something playboy with a penchant for younger women. When his current squeeze, Marin (Amanda Peete), invites him for a weekend retreat in the Hampton's, it sets off a chain of events that will see Harry struggling to give up his wanton ways for something he always considered unimaginable  the love of an older woman.Nicholson is terrific as he transitions from sexy swinger to forlorn lover. His Harry is a man conflicted, struggling to hang on to his youth in the face of his own mortality. Harry is a `dog', a commitment-phobe who uses women as playthings and has been celebrated in the media as an emotional escape artist. Nicholson plays that side well, but he also makes Harry extremely likeable, using charm and humor to win over Erica.Which brings me to Diane Keaton (Annie Hall, Father of The Bride). As wonderful as Nicholson is, this is Keaton's film and her performance proves to be worthy of nomination. Erica Barry is Marin's mother, a 50-ish divorcee' with a successful career as a playwright. Divorced and resigned to thinking she is past her romantic prime, Erica is thrown together with Harry through a set of rather comedic circumstances that ultimately lead her to realize that love is still capable of blooming even in the years of autumn. Keaton delivers one of her best performances in recent memory as Erica re-discovers a side of her life she believed might be lost forever. Her journey from strength to vulnerability and back again is funny, touching, and poignant.The film features nice supporting performances from Frances McDormand (Fargo, City By The Sea) as Keaton's feminist sister and Peete (The Whole Nine Yards, Saving Silverman). Keanu Reeves (The Matrix, Hardball) is ok as the handsome young doctor who convinces Keaton to embark on her own May-December romance.The weaknesses lie in Myers script. As with her previous writing/directing effort, What Women Want, there are plenty of sly observations regarding relationships between the sexes, but much of it treads familiar ground  only the faces and names have changed. The film is definitely slanted to a feminist point of view but, to her credit, Myers never allows Harry to look like a complete chauvinist pig. And, there are plenty of sparkling moments such as the look Harry gives Erica as he says the line `You don't want pancakes anymore?' after Marin interrupts a late-night conversation between them in the kitchen, or beautifully humorous scene in which Harry and Erica consummate their relationship, or Erica's over-the-top breakdown after she and Harry break up. But, there are also moments that feel unnecessarily maudlin and the contrivances that drive the story feel a little too convenient. The last act is particularly predictable and, while most will find the fairy tale ending satisfying, I felt as if Myers sold out just a bit.Something's Gotta Give may revolve around characters in the twilight of their loves, but its universal themes of love and discovering yourself broaden its appeal to a wider audience. While far from being a great film, it provides plenty of entertaining moments.",Something's Gotta Give

A bit of a shame to see someone who was so brilliant in Swingers reduced to a complete non-part that could have been filled by anyone. Frances McDormand's part was also a complete afterthought - just seemed like the screenplay writer got really lazy, and decided they needed another character somewhere, but didn't flesh it out in any way.
Overall, the film did have some funny moments, and was quite sweet and touching, but I came away feeling that really, it was no better than an average comedy. Jack Nicholson verged on self-parody - does he always have to look so pleased with himself? And the way the ending panned out was so entirely predictable and Hollywood. Wouldn't it have made it more interesting for Erika to end up with the younger man? It seems all romantic comedies are just slightly different variations on reaching the same boring conclusions.On a positive note, it was nice to see Keanu Reeves in a comedy role, and I thought his banter with  Nicholson provided some of the best moments.

I really liked the idea of the middle-aged romance and I think that the main actors - Nicholson and Keaton were perfectly chosen for their roles. I didn't though like several director's decisions and the too bright, reassuring and feel-good feeling of the film. I didn't like the scenes with too many smiles (like when Keaton and Nicholson were having a picnic on the beach; or the last one in the restaurant with Keaton's character's daughter and few other characters - I wouldn't like to spoil the plot) or the over-the-top scenes in which Keaton got so hysteric. I mean, she was supposed to be suffering and I didn't like it that the director wanted to make a laugh out of her suffering. As a conclusion... Hey, isn't Paris already a cliche as the most romantic city in films? Haven't any of those Hollywood film-makers been to Barcelona? Or Prague? Or... just elsewhere!",Something's Gotta Give
198,Fad King,A very funny comedy and a great showcase for Diane Keaton.,7,29 May 2004,"The set-up (romantic foibles among rich, sophisticated, well-educated New Yorkers) is reminiscent of a typical Woody Allen film, but this treatment lacks the quirkiness of Woody's best. Woody also never made ""issue"" or zeitgeist comedies and this film is all about the big issue of older men who date younger women, leaving exciting and vital older women to wither and dry up. The characters and dialogue here are much more straightforward and mainstream, which certainly was a factor in this movie's box-office success. There are several sequences of full-out raucous fun, balanced by the expected verbal sparring between Nicholson and Keaton.
Jack and Diane (maybe someone should write a little ditty about this pair!) are well-matched. It's so easy to take Jack for granted these days: long ago so many of his performances lapsed into self-parody. Yet all of that baggage is exactly why he simply HAD to play this character. But even if he's doing his standard schtick, he's still ""Jack,"" and he more than holds his own, as usual.With all of the florid acclaim for Diane's performance, you expect to be disappointed in some way. I was not. This really is a career high point for someone with some great comic credentials. It starts with being is one of those rare actors who simply cannot deliver a line without complete honesty. It continues with the realization that the whole time, she's adding so much that just couldn't have been on the written page of the script.",Something's Gotta Give
199,gcm-4,"Funny, witty, well worth it",10,1 January 2004,"Laughed straight through from beginning to end.  Lots of physical comedy and reaction shots that would be ""slapstick"" if performed by less skilled actors, but are just hilarious when nuanced by Nicholson and Keaton. McDormand's angry feminist was terrific also, but she's not on screen very much.I do agree with others who have said that it is most appreciated by the 40+ set who can relate to sagging flesh, reading glasses, and wondering, at their age, whether love is really worth it. At 47 I was one of the younger members of the audience.
You must suspend disbelief at times, but you can forgive this in a comedy. The worst case is at the beginning when Nicholson and the gorgeous daughter arrive at the beach house. The only reason you can believe that this beautiful young thing would be attracted to Nicholson is that he IS Nicholson. Any other actor playing the part with equivalent physical decline would never have been believable. It's Nicholson's charisma, not the character's, that make you believe the girl's attraction to him.One nitpick - dental continuity. At the beginning of the film Keaton's teeth are yellow. Then about half-way through, they are much whiter. This would not be so distracting but for the glow-in-the-dark white teeth of Amanda Peet providing contrast.",Something's Gotta Give

By the end of the film I found myself weighing which of the many contrivances were the least likely: the ""no hospital, no travel"" ruling, Keaton's sudden deluge of suitors, Nicholson's near 180-degree turn in his definition of attractiveness, the doctor's saintliness, the final ""twist""?  A smaller movie that didn't try so hard to position Keaton as The Attractive Older Woman in Our Culture might have worked better; removing the subplot with the younger man would have allowed the film to actually show Keaton as charming (instead of assuring the viewer that she is through other characters' claims for her) and to develop the Keaton-Nicholson relationship more convincingly.Overall, it's clever, amusing, and certainly a nice change to see women -- women who haven't been botoxed into Stepford Wife lookalikes! -- as central characters, but the writer has more to say than can convincingly be crammed into a single film.",Something's Gotta Give

I couldn't identify or empathize with any of the characters of which we had about six with a plethora of 'walk-on' beauties' reemphasizing Mr. Nicholson's choice of women. The humor was unoriginal and stale. It felt 'staged' and consisted mainly of farce with looks and grimaces of the seaside 'naughty postcard' variety. It was also a bit weary  having been seen in umpteen 'Battle of the Sexes' films. Don't get me wrong, I'm a great admirer of both Nicholson and Keaton but not on this occasion. They should take a long hard look at their respective contributions as I think they were 'hamming' it up from beginning to end. I've never liked Keanu Reeves in films as I think he has chosen the wrong profession. He is wooden, unconvincing and seems to have a very slight speech impediment making his lines feel torturous. All in all, this film lacked everything it set out to do, i.e. to be funny, witty, original and enjoyable!

209,cmccarthy-13,A romantic comedy with depth,10,24 November 2007,"Something's Gotta Give is essentially a romantic comedy but there is much more to this film than the usual string of comic misunderstandings all wrapped up with a fairytale ending. Harry Sanborn, played by the irrepressible Jack Nicholson, is an ageing Hip Hop producer who can normally be found living the New York city high life with a string of glamorous twenty something beauties. His life is turned around when he goes to spend the weekend with one such beauty. A misunderstanding leads to the girls mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and aunt gatecrashing the party. All four reluctantly agree to spend the weekend together. Harry and Erica take an apparent instant dislike to each other. Harry is threatened by Erica's wit and intelligence and Erica finds Harry's attitudes toward the fairer sex repugnant.The film changes direction and really begins to take shape when Harry's amorous ways lead to a heart attack. Erica becomes his reluctant nursemaid and the plot develops from that point.Jack Nicholson is essentially playing himself but does a fine job of things regardless. Diane Keaton is amazingly good as the repressed divorcée who has closed herself off from life and love. Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet give solid supporting performances as the doctor who takes a shine to Erica and Erica's daughter respectively. The film has much to say about relationships and the rules we impose upon ourselves. Harry refuses to entertain the idea of dating someone over 30 and Erica considers it foolish to date anyone younger than herself. Many men and women alike will relate to these attitudes. We are all aware of the different standards imposed on men and women in our society and this film does put an unusual twist on the familiar theme of Agrippa relationships. The underlying message seems to be that in matters of the heart it pays to have an open mind. This film has much more depth than your average romantic comedy but for those who find its message a little too close to home this can be simply enjoyed as a very funny and touching romantic film.",Something's Gotta Give

However, It didn't meet my expectation as it showed how weak is Jack Nicholson in portraying comic characters. His cheesy smile throughout the movie just turned me off. As for Keanu Reeves, I was surprised by the small role that such a ""box office"" star have. Fans Of ""Sweet November"" movie would be extremely disappointed by his rigid performance. As for Amanda Peet (whole nine yards) and Diane Keaton, their performance is extraordinarily portrayed as it shows womens' feelings and their expectations. This is one of the positive things that Nancy Meyers get right in the movie.Other than that, the movie suffers from few other mishaps such as the scenes of over-excessive sobbing that were annoying as well as its lack of what I call ""romantic moments"".The movie is aimed for a different audience.

220,missanthropy19,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen yet,8,11 May 2005,"I have to say straight out that this was one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. I've a fair few, and a lot of them are bland, predictable, usually unfunny and lacking any wit or brilliance. This movie more than makes up for all of those disappointments. It was witty, it was interesting, the two mains were developed as characters so well. Even though I find Jack Nicholson rather unattractive, I found myself enjoying his relationship with Keaton. They both had a lot of chemistry together. The best thing about this movie was the way it was written - it felt very real to me. A lot of romantic comedies tend to have a very smooth dialogue and plot that's quite formulaic (man and woman meet, they start to like each other, something goes wrong, they spend a bit of time apart but realise they're in love and get together in the end). Even though that happens in this movie - the way it's done is so brilliant and to be honest, I actually believed that Keaton was going to end up with the Doctor - which was why I was almost in tears/laughing at the end. I laughed a lot of the way through, cried at some scenes, I think Keaton played a great part. I think the one 'weak link' is definitely Keanu Reeves. He wasn't awful, but I couldn't really believe that he actually liked this woman and was hurt by her when she didn't show up for the date, etc. - i don't think he can act all that well. But, all that aside, this is a great picture - I don't think anyone could be disappointed.",Something's Gotta Give
221,linak11,Goes great with NyQuil,3,22 September 2007,"a perfect movie for a lazy Friday night, when you're too exhausted to go out, feel that a cold is coming up and get high on NyQuil and tea with honey and lemon. At times charming and even funny, this is a testament to the sad state of affairs the feminist movement is in. While women have won all the rights and accolades they fought for, they still cannot reconcile their inner strength and outward success with femininity in a masculine world. Apparently, being in touch with your ""inner woman/real self"", you have to be a mumbling, incoherent, yelping mess(worse acting imaginable by an Oscar-winning actress...). To be successful in life, a woman has to be neurotically cold and walled-in. Or a ditsy feminist with a strong hippie-lesbian vibe (""skillfully"" portrayed by another brilliant actress through wearing her hair in age-inappropriate pony-tails). I'm tired just from recalling this build-up of clichés. And it just gets worse. The final scene made me laugh, although it was actually sad that in America talented actors would agree to play a part in a movie with such ending. Or maybe this is the true testament to the perils of aging in a professional world - you'll fetch when they ask you to, even though it might be a really bad stick...Watch it lying down, under a cozy blanket.

222,Lelo34,Misleading promos,2,14 December 2003,"I thought this was going to be a fun little romantic comedy, with Jack Nicholson romping all over the screen, instead this was a sappy, women's empowerment(until the end) movie with a little mother daughter movie mixed in. I don't think I've ever seen a 2 hour movie with less character development or plot development, which by the way was painfully dull after the first half hour. Dianne Keaton was about as grating a main character as I've ever seen.  Her crying scene made me want to rip my own ears off. Keanu Reeves was dry, and lifeless.  I wonder if he was as bored as he looked doing this after finishing all the high action moves in the Matrix flicks. There were several plot points that were just ridiculous, and pointless, one of my main problems with this movie, was near the end when Jack shows up at Amanda's door with a full beard, in the next scene he's shaved it off, now, I understand the beard was to show that time has passed but they flashed the ""6 months later"" up on the screen, so the beard was pointless, I kept wondering why his travelings had made him forget how to shave. It seems like a small thing, but to me it showed how little the director understood the handling of the movie, it dragged on and on, with no end in sight. In short I hated it. And please don't try and pretend just because I didn't like it, I didn't ""get it"" this movie was just not good. And it gets worse the longer I reflect on all it's flaws",Something's Gotta Give

225,StarAxis,"This movie goes from good to bad to good to bad to good, by the minute. And it averages out pretty well!",7,2 January 2006,"The basic premise of this movie sounds like the exact opposite of a cliché. An old guy and a younger woman fall in love? A tried-and-UN-true formula. But here is a movie in which the older guy (played by Jack Nicholson, big surprise) and the younger woman actually start out together, THEN the old guy falls in love with a woman... who is almost his own age?! And the mother of the girl he has at the beginning, no less? Now, the instant I heard the premise of the movie, I immediately thought: ""This will either be a unique, touching, revolutionary masterpiece, or a politically-correct feel-good cornball, depending on the writers and director. Well, I might as well check it out, just to find out."" I checked to see who the writers and directors were. Then I saw that the movie was written and directed by a woman. Very good sign there, although I had never heard of Nancy Meyers until I saw her name on the back of the DVD case. Now, I started out thinking that this was either going to make me laugh and touch my heart, or make me roll my eyes. Somehow I wouldn't have figured on both. The movie does all three of these things. It seems in all the dialogue in the whole course of the movie, there is one pretty bad joke, then one really good one, then a tired one, then a great one, then... and the same goes for the scenes and shots. There's one overall hilarious scene, then one pretty cheesy one, then one really touching scene, then one corny one, then... well, you get the idea. Sometimes a scene was consistent, sometimes I couldn't keep track of how many times I changed my opinion of the scene, and the movie in general. Now, movies (especially comedies) aren't ALL about dialogue. Sometimes the little details (body language, cinematography and so on) can make or break a movie. And I think that was what made this one for me. Nancy Meyers sometimes has a problem with dialogue, but she CERTAINLY knows how to get comedy out of the ""little details."" I'm not just talking about the physical humor (which is excellent, above-par for any romantic comedy, let alone one with Jack Nicholson), but Meyers also knows how to use cinematography and editing to their own comic potential (I laughed very hard at the long shot of the hall after the I'm scene, where they appear at opposite ends of the hall, looking scared). Overall, I think Meyers could have gotten a little help with the screen writing (don't be afraid to ask for help), and the casting decisions were dodgy at best. But, I think somehow, after stumbling numerous times, the film managed to somehow stay on its feet and limp to the goal. 7/10",Something's Gotta Give
226,enije,Keanu Reeves is the real star here!,7,8 September 2015,"I've got to be honest. I have just watched this movie, 12 years after it premiered. I simply didn't have the stomach for another Jack and Diane movie, with two otherwise awesome actors doing the same thing again. This says a lot because I love Nancy Meyers films and must have watched the holiday at least ten times. And I was right. Jack is Jack and Diane is Diane. Its awkward and worn, albeit funny here and there. An absolute delight though, was Keanu Reeves. For a guy who is often typecast in roles as the mostly silent, pained, strained and/or not very bright guy, he is playing the role of his life here. He is witty, in tempi, charming and carefree - even a little bit audacious and he does not skip a beat. Any previous fans should watch this just for him and everybody else, like myself, should be a fan after watching this. Keanu, I saw a quote, where you call yourself ""not very bright"" - I refuse to believe that. One cannot act smart with that twinkle of ""knowing"" in their eyes unless they are smart.

I like Jack & Diane as much as the next guy, but the sound tech should have told the director that Nicholson speaks the entire movie in a low, monotone register we haven't heard from him since ""The Shining"".

229,HuckDJ,"Quite unrealistic but thats drama, Jack & Diane shine",5,25 January 2005,"Somethings Gotta Give is a very funny film. It has the style of a Doris Day film but with a modern feel and themes. Nancy Meyers who wrote and directed the Mel Gibson /Helen Hunt film 'What Women Want' brings romance again to the screen once more with her second writer and directing accomplishment with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.The track 'Butterfly' that accompanies the opening credits sets the tone for the film and Nicholsons' character Harry Sanborn narration sets it in concrete. This film uses Jack Nicholsons celebrity stereotype as its storyline for 'Something's Gotta Give' that he likes his women young and somethings' gonna happen.Jack Nicholson plays a successful, and as always… cheeky, entrepreneur who has come with his new young girlfriend Marin, played by Amanda Peet, to her her mums weekender beach house to consummate their relationship. Her mother Erica Barry played by Diane Keaton who, of course, appears & can't believe older Harry is her daughters' new boyfriend. That night Harry has a heart attack and is rushed to hospital. Here we meet Dr Mercer played by Keanu Reeves. Harry told not to travel in his condition is forced to stay at the house with disapproving Keaton.Keanu taking a shine to mother Erica (Keaton) provides us viewers a polar opposite view to Harry, as Keanu likes his women older and more mature.All the characters here are successful people, Keaton is a playwright while her sister is a university lecturer, Jack is a music producer and Reeves is doctor.So '… Gotta Give' is quite unrealistic… That’s drama eh, suspend realism and go with it… But then it could be I suppose.Yes, mum is disapproving as Jack is her age and is going out with her daughter but things happen so she learns some life lessons. Besides, what is a big American film without life lessons and morals? She does as well as old dog Jack.There are great character roles in Frances McDormand as Keatons' sister Zoe and Jon Favreau shines as Leo, Harrys assistant.Somethings Gotta Give is funny, sad and entertaining. Nothing deep but this film is… nice.The teaming of actors Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton might alone be enough to excite some people to see this film, and that is very well justified because their chemistry is easily seen here as together they shine.",Something's Gotta Give

The editing fits great and makes the entire story smooth and easy to watch and understand. I simply cannot imagine anyone else than Nicholson in the lead role, and he is just fantastic as the leech who prowls on young women because he finds women his own age gross. He is completely oblivious to the reality that young women may actually find him the same way.Diane Keaton does a great job in the movie portraying her middle aged love-smitten character. She fits the character really well.I read that Twentieth Century Fox declined making the film citing that the leads were ""too old"". Well, perhaps Twentieth Century Fox needs to grow up and get real. Society consists of people of all ages. The cast does not at all feel too old.I think this movie will stick around for a long time.

232,nell_ward,Nicksoon is great,6,12 March 2012,"Meyers has written a witty, sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of 'battle of the sexes' issues. She has outrageous fun exploring the phenomenon of middle-aged men cavorting with women half their age. Jack Nicholson, known in real life for doing just that, has a great time poking fun at his own public image while, at the same time, providing a richly textured portrait of a man who may not be quite as shallow as his persona would suggest. When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant, attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's, Harry, a middle-aged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful 'conquests,' is forced to re-evaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle. Nicholson is magnificent at showing us the profound confusion his character undergoes as he takes those much belated but faltering steps into adult maturity.Nicholson is, however, only one half of this extraordinary couple. As the other half, Keaton, having been handed what is clearly the role of a lifetime, has never seemed so natural and self-assured on screen. She makes of the character a capable, no-nonsense woman who has allowed her passions to lie dormant far too long. Though, on the surface, she appears confident and in control of her life, Erica is, underneath it all, a woman wounded by past experience and intimidated by a culture that expects women to be put out to pasture the moment they reach middle age. It is this combination of strength and vulnerability that makes Erica such a complex, recognizable individual – and it is the very quality that Keaton captures so exquisitely in her performance. The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.In addition to these two outstanding performers, the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic, clear-headed sister; Amanda Peet as Erica's level-headed daughter; and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.",Something's Gotta Give

First, before Jack Nicholson, we must give great credits to Diane Keaton, i was not expecting her this good. I really think that she deserved the Oscar, but you know, that year Charlize Theron, with Monster, was superb. Shortly, we see a great Diane Keaton in the movie. She gave one of the greatest performances that I have ever seen that an actress gave. Jack Nicholson was basically as always. Did not become an Oscar-nominating performance, but he,too, was pretty good. His sick scenes remembered me of Edward Cole character (The Bucket List) and well scenes, of Garrett (Terms of Endearment). He seemed nice with Diane Keaton, but they were a better match with Shirley MacLaine or even Helen Hunt. The film was not a high above the standards, but definitely fun. When you get in the last 30 minutes, you really get excited about the end, and not sure if there will be a happy end or not. Some last thing about Jack Nicholson, i think his performance was not less than years ago, Terms of Endearment that brought him his second Oscar. I should say that the movie is worth to see. Also i think that it is weird seeing Keanu Reeves in an emotional doctor role, though fine. I expected to see Frances McDormand more, but she was nice about her role. To sum up, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are two reasons to see this movie. I would give it 7.5.",Something's Gotta Give

Oh, and Frances McDormand, who is underutilized.  Also, the movie deserves to be commended for  even approaching the subject of the disgusting older men/younger women phenomenon, and for showing people who aren't under 40 making out, etc. etc. The movie itself is a stockpile of cliches and random, tedious dialogue, with just enough funny moments to keep me from wandering out into the lobby and checking out posters of coming attractions.  Full of weak plot moments, like the moronic play Keaton's character is writing and the rehearsal of said play in which, in 3 minutes of real time, they 1) show a prospective actor auditioning, 2) then are suddenly about to rehearse the hospital scene, when all the while 3) Harry and Erica are standing in front of a Paris set with fake falling snow.Apparently, this play is not only rehearsing all scenes at once, but is in all stages of production at once--what an interesting concept!  Oh wait, no, it's just lazy scriptwriting.  If this were a screwball comedy such lapses would be acceptable, but this is also a supposedly heartwarming drama, in which both leads burst into tears multiple times (I found one medley of Erica weeping while writing her half-assed play incredibly annoying), and which needs to establish a sense of reality for its drama to take hold.

Not being a much talking type, I left the ""battlefield"" for my mom and followed my sister's invitation to turn on the TV. The first thing appearing on the screen was Something's Gotta Give, which began just view minutes ago. Since I consider myself something of a fan of Jack Nicholson I stayed with this movie. Hilarious comedy at the beginning combined with serious and beautiful romance soon after held my attention tightly all the way along. Unfortunately an interruption prevented me from watching the movie to the end and we had soon after to leave, but I promised myself to get the DVD as soon as possible.Now, after watching the movie again, I have to admit that it surprised me. I didn't burst into tears anymore since I was 12 years old, and I never really did when watching similar movies, but Something's Gotta Give managed it. Other movies about romance were never deep enough to let me forget that they were just movies, but with this one it was different. The scene close to the end of the movie (some spoilers below!), when Harry was standing at the bridge in Paris, it began to snow and the feeling of hopelessness and sad loneliness began to spread, the wonder still happened. Yes, you would think, it always happens in such movies, but in this one it is believable. And when the car stopped nearby and Erica appeared, it was probably the best moment in the whole movie. One has to see it to understand it.To be honest, somehow I didn't get warm with Keanu Reeves in this role although I consider him an excellent actor, and all the time Jack had my sympathies despite his frequent clumsiness during the first half of the movie, so when it turned out that she didn't after all leave him alone with his late realisation of a love, everything came as perfect as it only could be. Yes, a woman would very well consider Jack Nicholson for Keanu Reeves, if she loves.I didn't know love yet in my life, at least I don't think I did, but this movie makes you understand all about it...if you are watching with the open heart.

The characters are well-played but not well developed enough in the script. I don't like them - none of them! Keanu Reeve's character is not believable. Why would a gorgeous doctor who could have any young vixen he wanted get involved with a senior citizen - even if she is his favorite author? This movie could have been good... maybe.

I can deal with the guy three seats down who doesn't know his Inside Voice from his Outside Voice.  I could even accept someone's ringing phone flashing violet at the half-way point of the movie.  But:How on earth could the director allow her little gem of a movie go to 2000+ multiplexes with an assortment of boom mikes dangling in almost every single shot?  The movie is billed as ""Jack & Diane.""  I suppose that's only fitting since as soon as a boom drops down to mess with someone's hair, you no longer see some potentially great performances and instead see some of yesteryear's finest actors rehearsing with all the precision of a little league softball pitch.This was a story with some potential sparkle in the vein of ""Down With Love,"" another story that chose to pit two strong characters against each other and trust the actors would zing.  Nuh-uh.  Not here.  At least one more draft would have given the stars the chance for a little subtlety instead of thumping you every few seconds with the out-and-out ""older women are sexy too!"" mantra.  And you just can't call them ""plot twists"" when the plot just meanders over and over for a half hour too long to deliver an artificial ending so contrived you just want to throw your hands in the air.I give Keaton points for a magnificent performance that breaks the Hollywood mold for actresses of her generation, and their actual on-screen courtship was magnificent (until the boom mike dropped back in to say hello and simply spoiled absolutely everything.)To wit: Script gets 6/10 for rushing unpolished material.

First there was the inane plot, which then led you to the cheesy, romantic, mumbo-jumbo; all resulting in confusion and frustration, because this is not what you were expecting from a comedy.I found myself fighting the urge to just turn off the movie, because I would never stop a movie before it was over, no matter how bad it was. But this movie almost made an exception to my rule. And before you knew it, I was diving for the remote every second an ending was possible, just to feign innocence later that I thought it was over.

And to star...of ALL actors, but ole' Jack himself is BRILLIANT, just brilliant!  He of all people needs to see that women only get better as they get older (quit dating young women Jack!), and yes folks, this is coming from a 29 year old that would NEVER date someone 20 years their senior (sorry Kathie Lee Gifford, we like Frank...but he is a little past his prime). Diane Keaton far outshines the rest of the cast as the BEST female lead role in years...and believe me, I've seen all the romantic comedies of the last decade.  What guts Diane has to reveal herself at her age, something she hasn't done since her early years in theater!  I could have lived without seeing Jack's ""BACK""side, but you know...each nude scene was integral to the storyline and WELL SHOT!

Her charm and her chemistry with Jack Nickleson and Keanu Reeves is fantastic. The story starts to go a bit wrong, when Erica is just 'okay' when her daughter is caught with such an older man, perhaps if casting wasn't Jack Nickleson, it would have been a bit more believable where you could see or feel what her daughter saw in him. I can see a possible attraction happening between Harry and Erica, but the middle and ending had me disappointed and left me empty and unattached. The 'love story' feels force, as every other dry drama/romance we see being created. We don't really know why the lead character is in love with the male lead, they just are. This movie would have been much better if Erica and Julien ended up together. It's the least you expect from a romance/drama and it actually seems plausible due to the fact you feel and see the love. Julien's character knows her work, and is around to read her final draft. He even stood back and admired her and you can see what he likes about her. We understand. He's even respectful when Harry comes around and he senses something about her. It makes me want to break out my writing skills and do a rewrite of the middle and ending.

Keanu showed more range than people give him credit for, and did an excellent job playing the role he was cast as - a supporting character, who is not supposed to outshine the lead roles, but rather enhance them (which he did). I was very pleased with this movie!  It did have ""several endings"" which, actually, didn't detract but instead made me think, ""Well, that's closer to the reality of what might happen,"" instead of being annoyed.  As Jack's character says, ""Finally, closure,"" and I was happy.  It was a good movie and I liked it quite a lot.

Harry is also a man chauvinist, and that doesn't make the situation any better... At this point of the movie, I am enjoying myself. It is humorous and funny, and I'm really having a good time. Things happen, and Erika and Harry ends up living together. Also, Erika starts dating the 20 year younger doctor Julian (Reeves). Harry and Erika are quarreling, not having a good time together at all. And for me, my smile is disappearing. The rest of the movie--- it sucks. It's not funny, it's not smart, it's not interesting.

I guess one of the factors that makes a romantic comedy good is when you can actually imagine yourself in the shoes of one of the characters, and it's possible that I haven't yet reached the right level of age or maturity to do the same thing with this film. I was hoping a good story line would make up for it but unfortunately, that is what this movie lacks.The story was a bit of fast and slow at the same time. It was painfully slow when they had to chronicle Harry's stay, but it was awfully fast when events happen one after the other. One minute she's crying (which was very annoying) and then she's dating someone else and...so much happened in two hours which might be impressive but it just doesn't make any sense. It's like fall in love in a week, move on in less and realize you haven't six months later. Let's just say that in a nutshell, it sounds like a teenage drama and I expected something more refined from a film with aged leads.Speaking of refined, I also didn't appreciate the nudity in the film which probably succeeded to entertain an audience somewhere, but all it did was make me squirm.

Right! How desperately pathetic. And then every scene after - she's doing over dramatic fake crying.And then, she writes the whole ordeal as a play.

It's unexpected and yet you couldn't imagine it any other way.Both Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are completely wonderful in this piece, really showing all their talent. In addition, they seem to have a great chemistry. The dialogs are funny and twisted, and as you'll see the soundtrack is really really good.

It had its moments, mainly because of the comical and witty lines, but that was about it.. or so I thought.. Then the second time I saw it, it felt like a different movie... It felt as if it was thousand times better... You would probably think it is because I understood things I did not catch the first time, like reading a book twice.. That would be partly true. I did notice some things I did not notice the first time, but ultimately, the second time was when I was recovering from a heartbreak. I turned from him mainly because his responses to my emotional confessions were just intolerable. Me too's and I dunno's and whatnot... And if you'd hear that kind of response after something releasing a part of you that is so deep, it is hard not to feel devastated and regretful of having feelings for that person at all.. Well this movie captured that in a certain part of it... and if you know what in the world I am describing to you, this movie will make you feel connected, that you are not alone... It is very touching when you can recognize that pain that takes over when you know something has been taken away.. and later finding out that maybe it was never there at all...(don't get the idea that the whole movie is based on this.. it's only a small portion, but I think it was the climax)In conclusion, it's not fun to watch this long movie if you don't know the ache and pain of love.

267,Conrad_Jarrett,'Something's' Gotta Go,3,15 January 2004,"Diane Keaton can't cry. In Something's Gotta Give, there is a period where she has to cry in brief scene after scene, and either she can't cry or the direction was very, very poor (I kind of think it was the latter). For me, her crying symbolizes everything that was bad about this movie. In the crying scenes, she just wails and wails - loudly. After awhile, it is supposed to be somewhat funny (I think), but it's really just kind of annoying. The crying is supposed to convey that she is getting over what is hurting her and channelling it into a more productive activity. But it just feels so disingenuous because of the brazen way it is portrayed. There is a way to get crying to be sad at first and then funny (see Broadcast News), but this ain't it. This crying is more like ""Ooh, look. It's Diane Keaton trying to ball her eyes out.""And that's what's wrong with Something's Gotta Give. Most of the scenes feel fake and like obvious attempts to manufacture the emotions that the director/screenwriter is trying to elicit. The very final scene (and I'm not ruining anything here) is the perfect example. It's basically a scene with the main characters looking cute and funny while music plays. Kodak moments to be sure, but they're manufactured Kodak moments.Additionally, all of the major performances disappointed me. Jack Nicholson's character is barely introduced before he has a heart attack, and the story gets thrown into motion. We're supposed to believe that he's Joe Cool Sr. - hip and attractive to much younger women. We're supposed to believe that not because of how his character is developed, but because...well...because he's Jack Nicholson.Diane Keaton wasn't particularly disappointing, because I've never been a big fan of hers, anyway. However, her character never seemed to be anchored to any particular way of being. It's the film's version of character development that her character evolves from an uptight recluse to a self-actualized, fully-empowered woman, but to me that transition was just too easy.Amanda Peet, playing Keaton's daughter, gives a one note performance that, while consistent with the rest of the movie, relies more on her beauty than on substance to get the audience to care about her. She smiles a lot, and is very definitely easy on the eyes, but she's basically another pretty face. In a movie like this, which suggests that Jack dates young women because he sees them as merely pretty faces, it's almost criminal to not prove to the audience that Peet is anything but.Finally, France McDormand, in a smaller role, seems to exist solely for the purpose of directly verbalizing the movie's thesis at the beginning of the movie. And we're supposed to respect her character's opinion - she's a professor. Her speech is another good example of the way this movie tries to get the message across - by telling the audience what the message is instead of showing it.Rating: 3/10",Something's Gotta Give

I was pleasantly surprised by Reeves (I still type-cast him in something like Point Break) who I thought was interesting and sincere.

No matter what the reason, if the result is more delightful movies like ""Something's Gotta Give"", I'm all for it.  A romantic comedy for us ""Baby Boomers"", it acknowledges that even those of us in our 50s and 60s have a need for romance and fun.Jack Nicholson is a pleasure to watch as the commitment-phobic cad who comes face to face that which he has never allowed to enter into his life-real feelings for someone else.  Watching him struggle with and work through these unfamiliar emotions (he doesn't even know the physical manifestations of stress, for instance) is one of the highlights of this film.  His growth seems real, not forced or rushed as with many other male leads (particularly many of Bill Murray's characters.)Diane Keaton shines as the playwright who writes romantic comedies even though she has stuffed her emotions deep into her past.  She also makes her growth through long forgotten emotions believable, especially as she writes out her hurt and frustrations in a hilarious way.Amanda Peet (as Keaton's daughter and Nicholson's initial romantic interest) and Keanu Reeves (as Nicholson's doctor who is infatuated with Keaton) turn in strong performances, but never outshine the stars of the movie, as befitting a story highlighting romance for the AARP generation.Go see ""Something's Gotta Give"".

However, it had some pretty major flaws, in my opinion. For one thing, there are millions of people who wouldn't find the depictions of heart attacks and panic attacks (masquerading as heart attacks)all that amusing. Of course, the younger people in the theater found all that hilarious. It obviously depends on your perspective.My wife thought the actors (particularly Nicholson and Keaton) were mugging into the camera from time to time. Personally, I think Nicholson should go back and study his performance in ""About Schmidt"" to see the proper way to play a part.We both thought Keaton looked way too old to play a 56-year old, and I was amazed to then learn that that's her age! Boy, has she aged badly.The pacing was quite uneven, with most of the humor coming in the first half of the movie. After that, the movie became very predictable. I found myself wishing we had seen ""Bad Santa"" instead.",Something's Gotta Give

The quality of Diane Keaton's performance is like a breath of fresh air,especially her crying scene (hilarious!!) you really feel like she makes her lines up as she goes, class act, a Hollywood Legend. Jack Nicolson appears in this movie as well, and does an equally fantastic job. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys great acting, a wonderful plot, and great French/Jazz music. I could watch this movie over and over, if you enjoyed Father of the Bride, As Good As it Gets, What Women Want, Father of the Bride Part II, or The Holiday, you are sure to love this movie, as it is by the same writer/director Nancy Meyers whom always delivers!! It conveys the same warmth and witty story telling that the latter movies possess. A must see!!",Something's Gotta Give

Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are splendid. The set is fantastic. And the atmosphere in the movie is gorgeous. Just think about the scene with Jack Nicholson and the staircase or Jack Nicholson in the hospital (the Viagra Scene). But of course the movie isn't only funny. Thoughtfulness is also a part of the show. How hard is it to be a sixty-years-old man who turns on the beautiful young girls? Did Harry Sanborn get a serious traumatic experience when he saw Erica Barry naked? Please dear reader, if you haven't seen this movie yet then do it for your own sake.",Something's Gotta Give
285,FrenchFry,Something's Gotta Get Interesting,4,9 May 2004,"Director Nancy Meyers (""What Women Want,"" 1998's ""Parent Trap"" remake) serves up another dish of bland and cliché romantic comedy fluff where believability takes a back seat on the Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton vehicle ""Something's Gotta Give."" Nicholson plays a successful record executive named Harry, whose highly publicized relationships with women much younger than himself has given him quite the reputation. ""Some say I'm an expert on the younger woman since I've been dating them for 40 years,"" he says during the film's opening voice-over.His current interest is Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), the daughter of a successful and divorced New York writer. The couple arrive at Marin's mother's home planning to spend the weekend alone together, but are abruptly interrupted by her mother Erica (Keaton) and Aunt (Frances McDormand). Things get off to a predictably shaky start, as Erica isn't sure what to think of her daughter being half of such a seemingly mismatched pair but still awkwardly agrees for the four of them to have dinner together. Later on in the evening, Harry is rushed to the emergency room after having a heart attack while fooling around with Marin. After his release from the hospital, Harry fires his nurse and Erica suddenly finds herself in charge of looking after him while he recovers.Against her better judgment and initial impression of Harry, Erica finds herself reluctantly falling for him. Surprisingly, Harry is dealing with his own growing feelings for her as well. Marin, noticing their attraction, is eager to step aside, but because a romantic comedy isn't complete without a love triangle, Erica is also intrigued by the advances of a younger doctor (Keanu Reeves). Predictably chaos, or at least mild antics disguised as chaos, insues.Billed as a romantic comedy, the film lacks many humorous moments and drags by at a lackluster pace. It feels all the more forced and unrealistic as we watch the characters go through situations that aren't there because they make sense, but because they're simply awkward requirements to move them from one place to another. The film creeps to an ending with a resolution all too convenient to be taken seriously. To their credit, the actors do their best to infuse some life into the project. Reeves gives a surprisingly solid performance, as does McDormand, but the other leads seem to be sleepwalking as they muck around in a flawed and ordinary film. For the most part, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is chronically underwhelming, tediously overlong and entirely forgettable.4/10",Something's Gotta Give

287,laura1234,"pretentious, self-indulgent mediocrity",2,25 December 2004,"I give this movie one point for not being outright offensive. I give it another point for Frances McDormand--I'm not sure why she chose to be in this movie, but for the little screen time she had, she was good. Everything else about this movie was mediocre. The writer/director, Nancy Meyers, obviously wrote this story about herself, and in this way made her main character a writer who is writing a story about herself. I find this whole phenomenon incredibly tedious. This is the same problem I had with Adaptation, but at least Adaptation featured characters outside the realm of the ""New York/The Hamptons"" bourgeois lifestyle which I find to be over-portrayed and about as interesting as a thumb tack.Another problem I found with this movie was the sets which were very often sound stages made to look like a house on the beach or a car driving through a lush landscape. The outdoor scenes as well were very often lighted strangely so as to make an obviously cloudy day look bright. I also have a problem with the whole French theme running through the movie. Hollywood bag of tricks number 3 billion 42: need some culture in your otherwise culturally devoid film? Add some French music and feature the Eiffel tower at least once. Please! This is one of those movies that could potentially go down easy if you're in a near vegetative movie-going state.

Male nudity is shown (Behind), as well as brief female nudity (Breasts are shown in two shots very briefly). My favorite performance was by Keanu Reeves who plays the nice guy who has his heart broken. Amanda Peet probably gave her best performance of her entire career. Thought Ellen Page would have been better for that role though. I would (If he were alive) replace Jon Favreau with Chris Farley.

However, the performances by Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet allow me to give an extra star - they were fairly good.I watched this movie with ALL it's prop/wardrobe, positioning/stance, angles/shot MISTAKES I think the director and director of photography and the editor should hang up their hats - except, I truly get the feeling the behind the scenes work was probably done to best of ability and the main actors - Nicholson & Keaton are at such a place in their lives with respect to their careers that all the goofs they'd once be demanding of themselves to get right, and have some degree of respect for the audience, and all the feeling they'd once be trying to convey with sincerity and depth, well they've just 'been there, done that' so they just didn't CARE.I love these two great actors ... can they really be so hard up for money? Did they think of the good ole' days during their classics together such as ""Reds"" and hope to just have some 'fun' again? Wasted talent all around, with a waste of my time to boot - were it not for the goofs I was counting up and shaking my head at watching, I think Walt Disney could have amused me better - and I loathe cartoons, and 'family' movies with 'sweet' plots and outcomes.I'd explain more, but I don't want to give any spoilers - if you're in to watching for mistakes in 'takes' this one is a power-house performance.To top it off though is the TOTAL and under predictable ""plot"" - if one could even call it such.

He could not buy into the Diane Keaton/Keanu Reeves liason as EVER going to happen though, no matter how good Diane Keaton still looks.  That's okay. My husband and I laughed throughout the entire movie and so did everyone else in the theater.  I noticed the audience was mostly middle aged women like myself, and I don't expect my twenty-something children to enjoy it as much as I did, but I do think they will like it. I am certainly going to take my seventy-six year old mother to see it. I know she will find it as entertaining as I did, perhaps appreciating it more than I since there are so few films that she finds engaging and inoffensive.

I realize that movies are about suspension of disbelief, but this was a bit too much. I guess Jack and Diane can have pain but not Keanu.2.

It was an emotional movie-- I laughed, I cried, I was saying aloud ""that's how it really is...""

I cannot fathom ever, and I mean EVER actually CHOOSING Jack over Keanu.  I mean COME ON!!!  So besides this movie's wildly ludicrous ending and setting it is also not a comment on what women think or feel, but what men believe they should think and feel.  So I guess with that view it's hardly surprising that a lecherous fat old man who had dated her daughter, messed up her house, and insulted her in her own home was Diane Keaton's pick of the heap.  I don't know where writer Nancy Meyers gets these ideas. Wouldn't it be nice to see a movie where the women ends up with a young handsome man who treats her well and adores her?  I don't see how laughing over being unable to see the time on a wrist watch without your glasses constitutes finding one's soul mate.  Was I on crack or was it Keanu's character who had seen all Diane's plays and loved her work?  Clearly Diane's work is almost biographical so isn't it actually Keanu who ""gets"" her?  And why is Diane so uncomfortable kissing a man who is 20 years younger than she, but Jack has no problems having sex with a woman 40 years his junior in her mother's home.

Yes, it is not only a compliment for Nicholson, but also for the writer who must have wrote this character for him.Of course the others like Keanu and Diane were also great, but with Nicholson on their side they had only a slim chance to bring home the palm. And here I must admit that Frances McDormand starred quite swell as well. She is unique with her gestures, I think she is funny and persuasive in her roles.So, Nicholson is superb!

I felt that it was head and shoulders above 'As Good As It Gets', mainly because I feel that Nicholson was more defined in his role and Diane Keaton is a much better actress than Helen Hunt ( not that I don't like or respect Helen Hunt, just an observation ).   The combination of Keaton and Nicholson is dynamite and the dialogue they have is witty, charming and realistic in many ways.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for good laughs with a romantic twist.   There isn't a dull moment in the film and the soundtrack is excellent.   I loved this movie.",Something's Gotta Give
323,rodeodriver,"Beautifully written, directed, photographed and acted",10,24 May 2005,"Beautifully written, intelligently directed, lovingly photographed and masterfully acted movie; even Keanu Reeves does a damn good job. It's comic, it's heartwarming, it's heartrending, it's heartmending. Diane Keaton is more beautiful now than she was 30 years ago, and Jack Nicholson is always a pleasure to watch. It was a brilliant bit of casting to combine these characters (Diane, Jack and Keanu? Someone very discerning saw the potential there). All this made it a real pleasure to watch the graceful plot evolve and enjoy the subtleties of intellect and emotion employed on all levels. If only they could make movies as sleek and intelligent as this all the time... Kids under 40 might not enjoy it all the way, though; you probably have to be fully experienced to love it to the max.",Something's Gotta Give
324,chunky_lover_0,Jack Nicholson has never done a worse film... to my knowledge,1,25 October 2004,"horrible, never see this film. i enjoy many Jack Nicholson films but his standards for roles to accept are going down... fast. ""something's gotta give"" is such an example, it is: long, boring, pointless and not worth a cent. you will feel no emotions come over you but disgust, and this is if you can stay awake the whole movie. total tripe. i cannot understand why i even considered this film as worth it's £5 ticket price. With such a cast you'd expect a lot, but the acting is below par (especially since your considering Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson) and the script is just... terrible! this like Nicholson's other new millennium film ""anger management"" are among his worst to date. shape up jack!",Something's Gotta Give
325,cinziacera,great but....politically correct,9,22 December 2004,"All the performances in the movie were very convincing. In my opinion the ending should have been different. Jack Nicholson' s character has learned his life lesson and become a better human being, that's enough of a reward. Diane Keaton's character has finally come out of her shell and found a wonderful, albeit much younger, partner, whose company she should keep enjoying. The politically correct ending avoids the controversial ""old woman- young man"" situation. In spite of this the movie is funny and at times touchy, like when Diane Keaton's character tells her daughter, crying, that really falling in love is worth anything.",Something's Gotta Give

327,attitude_monkey08,Somethings Gotta Give = great movie,10,13 March 2005,This movie was great! A very inspiring movie. I think the movie was about how you should really get to know some one before judging them. You can always see the bad in people and if you look hard you can get the good out. And also it is about how you can fall in love with the person you least expect. Erica Berry (Diane Keaton) was great she was really snobby in the beginning and then as she spent time with Harry she realized she needed to relaxers. Harry(Jack Nicholson) was a very neat character. He loved young woman. As he go to know Erica he realized he loved her and they both changed.In my opinion this movie was a movie about trying to find your true love. Two Thunbs UP :),Something's Gotta Give
328,vivienliuwei,It is very unusual,10,11 July 2005,"Masterpiece! I loved it so much. It is funny and brilliant,romantic and entertaining and what's more, it is very special and quite different from most of the other romantic stories. The plot is very unique. There is not a moment that i feel dull about it. The lines are clever and natural. I liked the music and the picture very much too. Very good performance. A little bit exaggerating, but full of good sense of humor. I have never liked Jack Nicholson before, but in this movie I think he is OK, not too wicked. Keanu Reeves is my favorite actor, and I found he really can act in any role. I have never seen Diane Keaton's movie before, but I liked her once I saw her in this movie, very intelligent and elegant. All in all, I highly recommend it. Enjoy it and you will not regret...",Something's Gotta Give
329,camillerogers,artist,10,10 July 2005,"Who did the paintings at the beach house? Art Kent Nelson? Where can I get his paintings? I need to write 10 lines to ask this questions for some reason. Anyway, it is excellent and I want some. In the DVD the writer mentions who he is but it was hard to hear. Sounded like Kent Nelson of Pasadena. Can someone tell me before I go daft writing 10 lines? It is Tamara like or 1930s in feel, but I believe it is current painting. Bright colors on Adirondack chairs, and just legs, or the girl with her face turned away. I have a feeling this website is not the right place to ask this question. I loved the film, in every way. Especially the Hamptons and then Paris, my favorite. There, 10 lines",Something's Gotta Give
330,jbondbutts,The movie is wonderful!,10,12 December 2006,"I loved this movie. It is a great, funny, and witty love story for two middle-aged adults and in my view we need more movies like this one! Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, both of whom I love to see on the screen, did an excellent job in this movie. The music in the movie is a wonderful mixture of French, rap, and pop. If anyone knows, I would like information about certain locations within the movie, e.g. the party Harry attended after he returned to NYC, and the restaurant where Erica and daughter met Erica's ex-husband. Does anyone know? We go to NYC frequently and I would be interested in visiting some of those locations. All in all, I rate this movie at the top because I love the story and the actors in this movie. Don't miss it!",Something's Gotta Give
331,seashanty163,Profoundly moving and simple,10,28 August 2005,"""Something's gotta Give"" is a poignant movie appealing mostly to women. However, on a much broader scale, many people male or female can relate to different life situations. The scenery is beautiful invoking a feeling of melancholy and wishfulness. The setting is in the Hamptons 'upper crust' beach community and if ever a fairytale movie this is one of them. The beach house where the movie was filmed is the type of house that most woman dream about. The kitchen open and serene, the bedroom with its window seating and fireplace, the living room opening up into a beautiful landscape complete with sand dunes and beach-front is the perfect setting to imagine oneself with a good book and a cup of tea. Whenever I see this movie it gives me a feeling of calm. That's what a movie should do. This is a beautiful 'stress-free' movie to be enjoyed by all. Profoundly moving and simple. I thank the producers and writers for giving me the pleasure of experiencing it.",Something's Gotta Give
332,angecour,My Fave Movie of ALL TIME - perfection - hilarious!!!,10,2 January 2017,"It this is only getting a 67% rating, then it's confirmation that the reviews here are SKEWED. This is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen, and while it's a chick flick, I challenge anyone not to laugh out loud at the entire first half of the movie. Every actor is perfection -- at the top of their game -- and the statement this movie makes about the gender difference as we age could not be made in a more witty, pointed, hilarious fashion. Perfectly cast and perfect set, Something's Gotta Give is perfection. I could watch it over & over again. If Rotten Tomatoes were geared toward women (same w IDMB) this movie would be hovering at 100%. Just sayin. Oh and the beach house is worth watching alone. Nancy Meyer goes to great lengths on her sets and I literally have screen shots of some of the rooms on my screensaver",Something's Gotta Give
333,joyce_hardy,Best Movie EVER!,10,23 April 2006,"I will have to say that I was not a Jack Nicholson fan before I saw this movie and did not think he was very sexy, but after this movie I adore him. I really felt the same way about Diane Keaton, but they both are terrific. My daughter was not a crazy about it but I think it is because she is only 30 and doesn't really understand love. I love the scene where Diane Keaton is talking to her daughter and tells her to just let go and fall in love because she will be hurt one day AND it is all worth it. I loved this movie so much that I have seen it about 20 times. The beach house where it took place is my all time favorite house. Everyone has told me that it is only a set but I would love to know if it is really someone's house. What I really would like to know is if I could get the house plans. I am serious.",Something's Gotta Give
