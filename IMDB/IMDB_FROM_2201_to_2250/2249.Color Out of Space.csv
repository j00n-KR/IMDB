0,Leofwine_draca,A surprise,7,15 November 2020,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, given the varied pedigree of those involved. Nicolas Cage is well known for shooting any old rubbish these days and has a greater amount of misses than he does hits, while Richard Stanley hasn't made a proper film in decades. As for the producers, well I hated MANDY, so expected more of the same. The only plus is that I'm a huge fan of H.P. Lovecraft, one of my favourite all-time writers, although again his works don't really transfer too well to cinema. The good news is that this is one of the better adaptations of his stories: freewheeling, imaginative, and extremely creative throughout when it comes to some quite stupendous visuals. There are moments of cheese, of pure repulsion and overacting when it should have been more restrained, but the climax is excellent and for the most part i found myself liking this one quite a bit.",Color Out of Space
1,SnoopyStyle,good,7,20 April 2020,"Nathan Gardner (Nicolas Cage) owns an alpaca farm in the woods. He and his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson) have three children. Daughter Lavinia starts flirting with hydrologist Ward who is checking on the water table. Ezra (Tommy Chong) is a squatter on the property. A meteorite crashes onto the front yard and disturbing things start happening.Based on an H. P. Lovecraft story, it's relatively simple in plot but fascinating in designs. I love the monster designs which remind me so much of the 1982 The Thing. Cage does almost screw this up. He's been doing his wacky crazy characters for so long that he has become a cartoon character. The role would be far superior played by a more fatherly figure. Someone like Michael Shannon could give it real intensity rather than Cage's cartoonish emotions. A much smaller problem arises from the high pitched squeaky sounds. It's too close to fingernails on the chalkboard. I'd prefer a different sound to denote the alien invasion. Overall, I love the monster designs and Madeleine Arthur seems to be an interesting young actress. The movie has a Lovecraftian feel while staying in the Stranger Things range.",Color Out of Space

3,kosmasp,Out of place,9,10 August 2020,"So the final one I saw (which I have to admit was actually the first one I watched - usually I try to keep the best for last - didn't quite work out that way this time around) - another adaptation of a Lovecraft short story! And man this is as crazy as it can gets. Another reviewer has mentioned the low budget nature of the movie (which I do not doubt is true), but I think you can't really tell! I watched the 4k version of this and it looks amazing! Astonishing, ravishing, the colors, the framing, the general mood this creates ... it has to be seen to be believed.Nicolas Cage: you might have seen him, so you will believe his different ""moods"" in the movie. Never boring, never a dull moment. Characters are being unreasonable a lot and you may have issues with that. If you can block that out and relish in the colors ... very earhly colors, but let's suspend disbelief and say they are from out of space ... why not?",Color Out of Space
4,Woodyanders,Strange stuff going down on the farm,8,27 October 2021,"The Gardner family live on a remote farm in rural New England. Things go nightmarish awry after a mysterious meteorite from outer space crashes on their property and subsequently causes all kinds of odd and terrible events to occur.Director/cowriter Richard Stanley relates the absorbing story at a deliberate pace, takes time to develop the characters, expertly crafts a potently brooding gloom-doom atmosphere that positively drips with dread and unease, and pulls zero punches as the grim narrative culminates in a shockingly dark and downbeat conclusion.Nicolas Cage goes gloriously bonkers as nerdy high-strung dad Nathan. Joely Richardson likewise does well as uptight cancer survivor mother Theresa. Moreover, there's praiseworthy work from Madeleine Arthur as rebellious teen daughter Lavinia, Brendan Meyer as feckless older son Benny, Elliott Knight as amiable hydrologist Ward Phillips, Tommy Chong as flaky stoner hippie squatter Erza, and Julian Howard as sweet younger son Jack. The striking widescreen cinematography by Steve Annis delivers a wondrous wealth of beautifully surreal and grotesque visuals. A supremely unsettling creepfest.",Color Out of Space
5,paul_haakonsen,This was surprisingly good...,7,29 January 2020,"Initially when I heard about this 2019 movie adaptation of the classic Lovecraft story, I must admit that I was more than thrilled. Then I found out that Nicolas Cage was set to star in it, and my excitement plummeted. Granted, Nicolas Cage is definitely not an actor whose performances I am particularly fond of. But this was a Lovecraft adaptation, so it had to be watched.And I am glad that I did. Despite having Nicolas Cage in the lead, I will say that director Richard Stanley really managed to pull together a blast of a movie. The story starts out slowly, setting the mood and introducing the characters. And gradually more and more layers were added to the story, that being after the impact of the celestial object, that is. And I loved the subtle changes that took place both in the environment, but also with the characters. It was so nicely done, very subtle, but still very noticeable and enjoyable.I was very entertained with ""Color Out of Space"" and the movie really turned out a lot more enjoyable and entertaining than I had anticipated.Nicolas Cage acted well enough in the movie, although there is that classic and archetypical Cage style to it, for better or worse, like it or not. The movie held some really nice performances by Joely Richardson and Madeleine Arthur. And as for having Tommy Chong in the movie, well... I will just let that be up to you to judge upon.Now, ""Color Out of Space"" had some impressive special effects, and the CGI team really managed to pull it off quite nicely. The special effects were really good and helped bring the movie to life on the screen in that particularly cosmically dreadful manner that was needed to carry with it the Lovecraftian feel.If you enjoy the Lovecraft story, then I can warmly recommend that you sit down and watch the 2019 movie adaptation. And my rating of the movie is a solid seven out of ten stars. Yes, I was entertained, and watched the movie twice; once for the story, and the second time for the details in the shots and to absorb the atmosphere and minute details better.",Color Out of Space
6,Quinoa1984,Richard Stanley's glorious return to feature films is a visionary delight,7,18 March 2020,"In an anxiety-riddled time as we're in right now, one needs the catharsis of certain cinematic comforts - and as it turns out, Nicolas Cage freaking out over rotten fruit (among other spectacular Cage-Time scenes, both subtle and wild and what the hell is that accent he's got sometimes but not all the time) in a pleasurable hallucinatory science fiction horror film is just what the doctor ordered as far as catharsis.Color Out of Space, which chronicles what happens when a meteor hits a farmhouse and a family has to try and keep the unfathomable insanity at bay (you know, that old tale that inspired like everything like it after, Jody Verill in Creepshow included), may not necessarily be all that deep or that is to say past its plethora of visual and probably aural metaphors if it has much to say, past ""hey, people can break apart *extremely* easy and to space-infused extremes.But in this case, that's okay! Stanley as a visionary (and he is) is out to be creepy while also indulging in creature fx that is mostly impressive and only disappointing when it involves some of the CGI monsters (the praying mantis alien is a stand out though) - and the plethora of purple lines), and I enjoyed seeing his enthusiasm for Lovecraft and letting his cinematographer and lighting team go  manic here. He's going for shocks more than dread het there's some of that too - and sometimes it's funny, too (who let Chong in? Hey why not)Did I mention this is Cage going Full Cage? It doesn't seem that way at first, even with the Alpalca milking... And then halfway through it seemed to click as he reached into his reservoir for freak outs, slow moving panic bouts, and shotgun blasts. I'm not even sure if it's entirely a *good* performance, and his character's motivations are all over the map, and at the same time Im just happy he's having fun with it all. It's a performance that has the context for it to go off the rails, and as a contrast to the relatively normal work of the younger performances.Bottom line, this is grisly, weird, and charged with terror. If only quarantining was like this! Oh, and did you notice the Brando cameo?",Color Out of Space
7,BandSAboutMovies,Welcome back,8,4 March 2020,"Richard Stanley, welcome back. Ever since the debacle which was The Island of Dr. Moreau - and brief visitations which gave us the Stanley-written Replace and the documentary The Otherworld - this genius was mostly silent. Just watch Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau to find out why.That time is over. Now, the first of three proposed H.P Lovecraft films by Stanley has arrived and it's everything I ever wanted it to be.Nathan Gardner's (Nicolas Cage, of course, nature made for a movie with Stanley) life is in transition. His wife Theresa (Joely Richardson, sister of Natasha, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and stepdaughter of Franco Nero; she's astounding in this) feels mutilated after her recent mastectomy and is losing clients because their internet is so fragile out in the country. His daughter Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur, Big Eyes) has turned to Wicca to heal her mother and escape her life. His son Jack is withdrawn and only takes to the dog. Another son, Benny, years to escape with the drugs he smokes with a hermit named Ezra (Tommy Chong). And he keeps failing as he attempts to raise alpacas and tomatoes.That's when a meteor crashes and changes everything for the worse.Ward, a scientist, tries to warn them not to drink the water that the meteor has contaminated. But it's too late. Too late for the alpacas, which have become hairless monsters. Too late for the wifeand young son, who are fused into one being. Too late for his other son. Too late for Nathan, who is driven insane by the color itself. Too late for even the young hero, Ward, to save the girl who has scarred symbols all over herself as she collapses into ash in his hands, but not before sharing a vision of the world that this color has come from, a place that destroys minds.This was obviously a personal film for the director. His mother as a huge Lovecraft fan and read the story to Stanley when he was 12 or 13. He claims that the story has ""always been a part of his psychological makeup."" As his mother died from cancer, he would often read the author's stories to her. And if rumors are to be believed, Stanley and Swedish filmmaker Henrik Möller performed a ritual to the Lovecraftian god Yog-Sothoth to get the film made.Every frame of this film shows that Stanley is a master. In a world of people creating content for the machine, he remains a unique artist. Whenever I am worried about our place in this universe, I remember that it still creates artists like him - and Cage - unafraid to howl in the dark, unworried and uncaring what others may think.",Color Out of Space
8,Coventry,Space: above and beyond your wildest imagination!,6,15 October 2020,"Admittedly, I wanted to get more satisfaction out of this film, but I reckon I can only blame myself. My expectations were unrealistic. Whenever I read the words ""H.P Lovecraft adaptation"", I dream of stumbling upon another ""Re-Animator"" or ""From Beyond"". But, in fact, these two are the atypical Lovecraft tales. The actual style and stories of Lovecraft are atmospheric, mysterious, nightmarish and cosmic instead of gooey and outrageous.With ""Color out of Space"", the eccentric filmmaker Richard Stanley (""Dust Devil"" and a partially shot ""Island of Dr. Moreau"") attempts to combine mysterious with gooey and outrageous, but the emphasis nevertheless clearly lies on the ""cosmicsism"". To illustrate this through the case of ""Color out of Space"", we all have a cliched and banal interpretation of an extraterrestrial invasion. We promptly think of space shift and odd creations, but in Lovecraft's universe it's a string of strange and complex events the human brain can barely even fathom.A kind of extraterrestrial invasion is what overcomes the already struggling Gardner family. Father Nathan desperately hopes to make his alpaca farm profitable, mother Theresa (no pun intended) slowly recovers from a terrible illness and teen daughter flees into spiritualism. When a meteorite crashes into their backyard, their lives turn into a living psychedelic hell. ""Color out of Space"" is definitely a visually stunning experience. The film has great effects, with use of digital and CGI reduced to a minimum, staggering locations, twisted humor and - oh yeah - a phenomenal Nicolas Cage. Together with the previous year's released ""Mandy"", this is the greatest of his films in more than a decade.",Color Out of Space
9,Hey_Sweden,"""What are you going to do?"" ""Handle it.""",7,7 July 2021,"Cosmic horror gets a major workout in this, the first feature film in 25 years for Richard Stanley (""Dust Devil"", ""Hardware"") after being fired from the production of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"". It also marks a 21st century adaptation of an H. P. Lovecraft short story that was also turned into ""Die, Monster, Die!"" in the 1960s and ""The Curse"" in the 1980s. It unfolds like a true waking nightmare, an endlessly nasty and surreal amalgam of horror movie imagery and imaginative gore effects. It's clear that it won't be for all (or even most) tastes.Nicolas Cage gets yet another chance to be a typically quirky, nutty character, playing Nathan, an alpaca farmer (!) with a dysfunctional family. Late one night, a deadly pink meteorite lands on their property. And this is an object with far-reaching potential: it affects all sorts of macabre changes in the environment, including infecting the local water supply. An amiable young hydrologist (Elliot Knight) comes to check the water, and is in for some disturbing surprises. In fact, the arrival of this object from space could have horrible consequences for the whole world.The comedy here can get rather goofy, but in a film like this where things are taken to very dark places, viewers will realize the need for at least some levity. Cage is a hoot as he once again indulges in scenery-stomping theatrics. Tommy Chong is well cast as a squatter who lives on the family property. The most appealing character present is the teen daughter Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), who is also one of the more intelligent characters present: she knows the family has to get the Hell out of Dodge, but fate and Cages' stubborn dummy Nathan get in the way.The film may be short on sense, but that is entirely the point as co-writer / director Stanley guides us through this journey through Hell. Best of all is the creepy scene with Chong near the end where we do get some insight into this ""colour out of space"": its motivation, modus operandi, etc.Elijah Wood was one of the producers; another of the producers, Josh C.

12,evanston_dad,Blech,4,14 August 2020,"There comes a point about half way through any movie starring Nicolas Cage when you can almost see the director throwing up his hands and giving up trying to eke out anything resembling a natural performance from Cage. From that point forward, the movie becomes a joke, no matter whether or not it's supposed to be funny, and it buckles under the weight of Cage's exaggerated and grotesque antics.""Color Out of Space"" would be an unpleasant movie anyway, but it's made even more so by Cage's borderline terrible performance. It's a sci-fi horror movie about some sort of space rock that crash lands in the back yard of a family living out in the middle of nowhere. It's one of those domestic stories where a crisis faced by a family highlights the already strained relationships they all have to one another and skeletons tucked safely away in the closet will no longer stay in hiding. In this movie, there's also an attempt to work in some environmental finger wagging. But none of the subtext is developed much, and most of the movie is given over to gross out effects.I've not read the H.P.

13,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable if flawed genre effort,8,3 October 2020,"Living alone on a remote farm, a family is unnerved to find a massive meteorite has crashed in their yard and tries to come to terms with what happened as a series of strange incidents and accidents soon befall them and others in the area, forcing them to find the cause of the incidents before they suffer terrible fates.This was an enjoyable if somewhat flawed effort. One of it's more enjoyable elements is the chilling and somewhat suspenseful build-up here that focus on the strange vents they experience. After the fateful encounter with the meteorite, the build-up moves from simple forgettable manners about what chores they have to do or hearing odd noises around the farm to strange full-on accidents including the situation with the mother. Far more chilling and creepy is the youngest son who's infatuation and near-catatonic state around the well offers a far more compelling piece about the buildup around the house, which is the same for the constant magnetic and electrical disturbances that occur throughout here. As well, once the film goes into the second half where it really gets unnerved and has a lot of thrilling elements on display. Going for more of a body-horror route as well as a psychological one with what happens here, including the strange mutations that are shown with the fruit and animals grown on the farm but also the continuing behavioral changes that take place creates a rather enjoyable time. When those changes start to become physical with the skin-rash or the stellar idea of the fusion attempts that happen to feature extremely goopy effects work throughout here, this one changes tone and feel into a much darker and threatening experience. With a tense finale that offers some enjoyable and thrilling action, these here are what hold this one up for the most part. There are some pretty big flaws featured here. One of the biggest issues is the overlong running time here that comes along due to the series of early setups that aren't that interesting. The family life before the accident is necessary to get an idea of what drastic changes are made once they get corrupted by the meteorite's influence but the problem is that these scenes are played out at a dull tempo that isn't all that exciting. Rather than ramp the intensity factor up considerably after the incidents that are shown to take place, the laid-back pacing that carries on here removes a lot of the tension which is a big reason why this one runs on way too long for its own good. The other detrimental factor here is the inherently and wholly stupid actions throughout here that keep everyone in danger for no reason other than gross stupidity. Hardly anything that happens here, from the arrival and sudden disappearance of the meteorite, the near-constant flashing of the strange lights around the farm that are never investigated or explained, or the mutations that occur to the flowers and wildlife ever raise any kind of urgency or sense of investigation into what's going on. Even the fusing of their own family members into a single entity propels them towards wanting to leave and it feels unrealistic that it would occur in this manner, generating less sympathy for them through this. Overall, these are the films' main issues.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and violence-against-animals.",Color Out of Space
14,trashgang,if you can wait a while gore and Lovecraft do comes in,8,16 March 2020,"H.P. Lovecraft, if you are into his books and stories then this is a must to see. If you are into weird flicks then this is for you. If you dig eighties horror then this is for you, otherwise stay away from it. i mean, I do see a lot of negative reviews towards this flick.The reason is simple, Lovecraft isn't for everybody and this flick is 100% adaption of the book. For those older ones who are into horror let me say this. If you did love ""From Beyond (1986)"" another Lovecraft adaption then you will love this one. It did remind me a lot towrads that one. If you do love ""The Thing (1982)"" then you will surely be reminded of that classic with the alpaca's in this flick.But, I agree, it takes a whiole before the strange world of Lovecraft opens towrads the viewer.

It isn't a secret anymore that Nicolas Cage sometimes plays in terrible movies, but occasionaly he's in good ones as well. You just can't be too picky anymore when you see his name, just hope for the best. The reason i watched this movie is that it is based on a novel of H.P. Lovecraft. His weirdness has something appealing, made me curious what it would be this time. The result wasn't bad considering all those elements, Lovecraft and Cage, certainly not for this genre.

It's based on a Lovecraft short story, a notoriously difficult material to bring to modern audiences. It stars Nicolas Cage, which is like a dmg modifier: either makes the movie greater or it brings it further down. Finally, there is no other well known actor in this whole movie. But I am happy to report that the film is actually good. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it achieves several things. It stays close to the source material, without making it all feel old and out of date. It doesn't shy from the horrible, with The Thing and Annihilation style special effects. It keeps the characters (and actors) in check by focusing on the overall weird rather than dragging it on with personal experiences that wouldn't matter at all in the end.Bottom line: for a jaded horror fan, it might feel like a jumble of other movies, good movies though.

It's based on a H. P. Lovecraft story and centres on a family of five whose remote forest home, (somewhere in the United States though the movie was made in Portugal), is hit by a meteor, complete with the requisite aliens that such movies have to have but unlike the big sci-fi disaster films of the past this is a decidely low-key affair that is genuinely creepy in the best sense, at least until Stanley pulls out all the gory stops.A fine cast, headed by Nicolas Cage, Joely Richardson and very promising newcomer Madeleine Arthur keep things fairly realistic for most of the running time and by centering on a small group of people, Stanley is able to build the frighteners very nicely.

Naturally, things don't go well as this lump of rock contains a lot more than they bargained for... namely a lot of 'purple.'The film comes in at about one hour and forty minutes and don't expect too much in the way of horror or monsters in the first half. It's all about building the characters (quite slowly!), but don't turn it off in disgust as it sure picks up in the last act. It's a kind of psychedelic horror film with plenty of gross effects and excellent computer generated weirdness. There seem to be a lot of 'practical' creature effects mixed with some great use of computer-generated graphics where the colour purple swirls around our human landscape.Nicolas Cage is possible the film's major selling point when it comes to 'star power' and he does his best to 'dial back' his natural tendency to 'chew up' the scenery. He plays quite a muted character (by his own acting standards) and only really hints at going 'full Cage' towards the end.It's quite a slow film, but ultimately if you like your creature-features then you'll probably find it quite rewarding in the end.",Color Out of Space

First, the science, or lack of it.

Somehow stays a sphere that just sits on the surface despite velocities in the thousands of mph.

Second, all elements of this script been done before for decades. Meteor contains life form that likes to take over living things & make them look, just to us coincidentally, as grotesque. Happens to hit near a family so it can take over children & produce strange behavior. A lack of intelligent investigation by whomever so alien gets to have fun.
Third, special effects. (The only thing that might rescue bad stereotypical acting & script.)

And as I like Mandy I like this one too: Color Out of Space is in my humble opinion one of the few good movie adaptions of Lovecraftarian horrors (there are a lot more as one might think but most are thankfully somewhere hidden deep and well in the tombs of oblivion) - what you get is a fine story, fine visuals, a B-movie pulp attitude and solid acting.

27,southdavid,"Missing me, Missing ""U"".",7,17 November 2020,"With ""Lovecraft Country"" in my recent memory, it seemed like a good time to watch an adaptation of one of his actual stories. ""Color Out of Space"" is a modern retelling of the short story of the same name and I genuinely can't decide if I hated or really liked it.A Meteorite crashes on the grounds of the Gardner family's woodland homestead. Though it quickly disappears it appears to have a profound effect on both the nearby organic life and localised electrical fields. The effects eventually reach the family affecting their perceptions of time, colour and in some cases reality. Are these changes really happening, or has something leaked into the groundwater and is slowly poisoning the Gardeners?So many Lovecraftian stories aren't adapted into films and shows because their narratives, and in particular their resolutions, in which characters, and often the narrators, descend into madness is difficult to translate. ""Color Out of Space"" works (or perhaps doesn't work) because it decides to show that spiralling confusion and psychosis. The producers landed on the natural leading man for showing this, and Cage doesn't disappoint. Initially a slightly bland protagonist, the meteors effect on him is demonstrated by him doing a dead-on Donald Trump vocal impression before locking his family in various rooms, shouting at them, insisting that everything is OK and talking to people who aren't there.As the story runs on, aspects of Cronenberg or perhaps early Peter Jackson body horror come into the film, these are some of the most successful moments in a film that is visually striking all the way though. The effects appear largely practical and a game Joely Richardson must have wondered what she'd signed on for at certain points.Those looking for convention, either in horror or just storytelling, are likely to be disappointed and I can't help but thinking I too would have been more satisfied with just a little more understanding of the rules of the film, i.e. what the color can actually do as opposed to just ""everything"" - but I was certainly never bored and am still thinking about the film a couple of days later.",Color Out of Space

The original is one of the most well-known stories by Lovecraft and probably one of the easier ones to adapt to the silver screen.In this filmization, directed by Richard Stanley, the events are moved to modern day Massachusetts. The inimitable Nicholas Cage plays the lead as the father of the family and owner of the farm, while the lead supporting role probably goes to Madeleine Arthur as Lavinia, the daughter of the family.Richard Stanley has good eye for visual spectacle. Visual effects are utilized with tasteful hand and the colour palette is suitable outwordly and spooky. And when the horror starts to crank, it looks disturbing.As for the story and acting, they're honestly nothing we haven't seen before. Both Cage and Arthur are enjoyable to watch, being far more kooky than their peers, but that just means that all the rest are rather bland in comparison. Likewise the story chucks along on fairly predictable tracks, and while that's true for most horror films, I ended up hoping for some kind of twist that would have made it feel fresh. Now it ends up being a clichéd film, albeit one that's executed better than most.That being said, I enjoyed seeing it.

Obviously long gone are the days of big blockbuster films where his star-power was enough to carry a film all by itself, but much like Shia LaBeouf what he is doing currently looks a lot more fun and up his alley. He seems to love the freedom to go absolutely crazy with a role and basically do whatever he wants. He's not bad at it either. He was quite captivating to watch in 'Color Out of Space' as were the entire cast for that matter.This is an extremely visually unique film. The use of colours in the film (a part of the plot - sort of at least) is incredibly beautiful and makes the film very distinct and memorable for that reason alone. Also the film is a lot darker than I expected it to be. Around the halfway point in the film something happens that really took me off-guard and and took the film to another level in terms of brutality.I feel like Stephen King would like to have his name to a film like this. Back in the day when he still cared about his writing this is the kind of story he would've created. The only downside of the film to me was the ending. It felt a bit flat and uncreative, almost like they couldn't think of a proper and fitting way to conclude it.

33,drqshadow-reviews,"Pointlessly Nutso and Thoroughly Flashy, it's a Nic Cage Playground and Nothing More",2,28 January 2020,"Based on a classic slice of short fiction by HP Lovecraft, this long-incubating adaptation is an overly flashy, effects-laden blend of sci-fi and horror. Nic Cage plays a semi-retired family man whose isolated upstate farm is struck by a meteorite, which then evaporates and causes all sorts of bizarre changes in the surrounding environment. Pink trees, mutated animals, unexpectedly abundant harvests, that sort of thing.Among the afflicted is Cage himself, who revels in the chance to amp up every last one of his craziest on-screen tendencies. My god, what a Cage-being-Cage film this is. He's howling, he's gesticulating, he's painted in blood and cackling, he's... suddenly and inexplicably changing accents? I'm not sure how much direction he took here, because it looks like they just focused the cameras and kept rolling while their star actor did whatever felt good, with the occasional interruption from family members or special effects showcases. And, as perversely entertaining as that can be, it doesn't merit a film unto itself.The scraps that surround those indulgent bouts of overacting are awfully scant, narrow and underdeveloped, like the worst '80s straight-to-video productions. It's trippy, but pointlessly so. We get cryptic prophecies and arcane imagery as props, mere window dressing that's waved around and then forgotten. Even the visuals can seem laughably dated, particularly the goopy, absurd creature effects.

34,CubsandCulture,It is a mixed bag; it is unsure of how close it wants to follow the short story.,7,4 August 2020,"This is definitely one of the better Lovecraft adaptations I have seen. On its own merits it is a fun, eerie horror film that has enough gore to be gross and enough suggestion to be unnerving. It has a gonzo Nicolas Cage performance and the effect work is really nice. Stanley hasn't lost a beat on technical direction. Even at the script's worst moments the film looks polished and is visually compelling.With that said the script really needed to decide if it wanted to stay with Lovecraft's story or instead tell a different tale inspired by it. It tries to do both and suffers for it. The modernization in itself is fine but the Gardner family being city-dwellers trying to get back to nature adds a bunch of subtext-ecological fable?-that isn't present in the original. And this angle does not add anything. Likewise, the film resists giving an explanation/intelligible character to the color-it is as alien in the film as it is in the story-but the film *greatly* condenses the timeline which largely wrecks the atmospherics. The movie is missing the slow burn of the original story. The film trades subtlety for gore while retaining the alien-ness of the color. It ends up being an uneasy marriage.On the visual color itself the film adheres to the story's description the best it could. (it is impossible to come up with an unseen color) I like the neon lilac they selected and they shift the presentation along a spectrum. It *feels* correct.",Color Out of Space

HARDWARE featured a killer cyborg that kept rebuilding itself to carry on its threat to those it encountered and DUST DEVIL featured a mysterious killer with supernatural tendencies. He then began work on THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU in 1996 with Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer only to be fired the day shooting began. Stanley disappeared from feature films after that incident, chronicled in the documentary ""Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau"". Only now has he returned with his take on the H.P. Lovecraft tale COLOR OUT OF SPACE.The Gardner family has moved to a country home after the mastectomy of mother Theresa (Joely Richardson). Nathan (Nicolas Cage) feels it will be a more wholesome atmosphere for his family. Daughter Lavinia (Madeline Arthur) disagrees and misses her friends. Her brother Benny (Brendan Meyer) just wants to get along. And youngest Jack (Julian Hilliard) is oblivious and enjoying himself. Each of these characters has issues and they all come to play as the movie progresses.Their secluded existence is shattered one night when a mysterious pink/purple meteor crashes on their property near their house. Emitting a glow unlike anything they've ever seen, Nathan contacts the local police to check it out. When they arrive the meteor is beginning to deteriorate and seep into the water table. On hand to learn something about it is Ward, a hydrologist whose been surveying the water table in plans for a hydroelectric dam. He take samples to be tested and Benny suggest they also talk to Ezra (Tommy Chong).Ezra is a stoner who lives in a shack on the property. When Nathan and Ward visit him he plays them a recording he's made, talking about creatures moving underground. They pass this off and ignore him as he continues to listen.Jack has become fascinated with the nearby well since the meteor struck. He insists he keeps hearing a man inside the well calling to him. At the same time the vegetation around the well takes on a life of its own, growing into unknown plants all with that pink/purple tint to it.As the residue from the meteor seeps into the ground water and the family drinks from it, they also begin to change. Nathan becomes prone to violent outbursts and nonsensical rants. Theresa seems to completely zone out. Only the teens begin to see something is happening as the cell phones stop working and other strange occurrences take place. Unable to figure it all out, the viewer is left to wonder what it was that came from the meteor and if the world let alone this family can survive.This Lovecraft story has been filmed before in different ways, first with the Karloff classic DIE MONSTER DIE. In 1987 it was turned into the film THE CURSE. Then in 2008 it was used again in an Italian version of the story. Now Stanley has returned to film his version.The movie looks amazing, especially when you realize that the budget couldn't have been much. That's not a slight but a fact with the production company not creating big budget films. The same would hold true of trusting Stanley to helm a new movie after all these years. And yet both risks seem to have paid off with a movie that's fascinating and hold your interest start to finish.The appearance of the film is outstanding and the cinematography, production design and special effects are top of the line. The coloring decisions used are gorgeous and help add to the mystery of the film. The effects at moments reminded me of John Carpenter's THE THING but I'd rather not go into it for fear of ruining the film for those who have yet to see it. Suffice to say the effects are handled well.Stanley appears to have redeemed himself for the self-imposed exile he took on after MOREAU. That's a good thing to see as my guess is he has more movies that need to be set to film. His ability as a director hasn't shown signs of weakening and watching this film will only make fans anxious to see the next release he has planned.On the whole the movie will entertain and hold you in its grip from start to finish. Fans of Lovecraft should be pleased with this effort.",Color Out of Space

41,kluseba,Classic horror film trademarks brought back to life in a refreshing way,9,28 February 2020,"Based upon a famous story by American horror author H. P. Lovecraft, Color Out of Space is the first full length movie directed by South African filmmaker Richard Stanley since mystery thriller Dust Devil twenty-seven years earlier. This is supposed to be the first movie in a trilogy of films based upon Lovecraft's writings. This experimental horror film has already gained an underground cult following and there are numerous reasons why any horror movie enthusiast should watch this outstanding movie.First of all, the mysterious plot takes its time to unleash its creepy vibes and gets increasingly intense leading to a memorable finale. The film doesn't need lazy jump scares or gore elements but convinces with gloomy atmosphere and witty storytelling alone.Secondly, the visual special effects are absolutely outstanding and are truly otherworldly which suits the science-fiction horror theme of the story. This might actually be one of the most visually appealing horror movies ever made.Thirdly, the settings are perfectly chosen from the remote camp in the forest over the seemingly beautiful stable and farm to the gorgeous architecture of the family home.Fourthly, the acting performances are second to none. Nicolas Cage convinces as caring family father who slowly but surely goes insane. Joely Richardson plays his physically sick but mentally ambitious wife. Brendan Meyer delivers the goods as neglected son who hangs around with a strange hermit and starts consuming drugs. Madeleine Arthur is the charismatic family daughter who is interested in the occult. Julian Hilliard plays the youngest son who is withdrawn and only interacts with the family dog. Even the side characters are very convincing but the five lead actors and actresses have particularly outstanding chemistry.Fifthly, the plot itself needs to be pointed out. It tells the story of a meteor that crashes in the family's front yard and gradually modifies the animals, landscapes and even the family members in abominable and mysterious ways. Telling you anything else would spoil the outstanding movie that might be best enjoyed if you're not even familiar with Lovecraft's original story yet. The movie might however inspire you to read the fascinating story afterwards.In conclusion, horror movie enthusiasts should definitely watch Color Out of Space that can be considered one of the very best horror films in recent memory. It's refreshingly different from other contemporary horror movies that rely on shaky cameras, jump scares and lots of gore. This horror movie is old-fashioned without being boring, limited or predictable at all. It recalls classic horror movies like The Shining and deserves more than its underground cult status. The upcoming two Lovecraft adaptations by Richard Stanley can't come soon enough. On a closing side note, you should listen to the song Color Out of Space by Japanese heavy metal veterans Ningen-Isu who managed to adapt the fascinating story into a gloomy masterpiece of about six and a half minutes.",Color Out of Space

There are shades of The Thing, Videodrome , Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers and even Poltergeist in this film but they contribute to a synthesis which Stanley can claim as his own. Nathan (Nicolas Cage) has moved his family to a remote farm where he raises alpacas and grows tomatoes. Each member of the family are unhappy in their own way: Nathan is a frustrated artist who drinks too much; his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), a financial adviser has had a mastectomy, she can't get a good connection with the wifi; daughter Lavinia (Madeline Arthur) turns to Wicca and performs rituals to cure her mother, older son Benny (Brendan Meyer) smokes pot, younger son Jack (Julian Hilliard) is introverted and only relates to the dog Sam. Nathan says they're living the dream but who dreams of shoveling alpaca crap?Things liven up when a meteorite falls nearby, giving off strange colours. Soon local flora and fauna are being affected, this is no ordinary fallen stone. Ever been menaced by a mutated moggie? Even stranger things happen to the alpacas, as for the tomatoes, they give Cage an excuse to chew up the scenery. It also becomes obvious that humans are coming under the control of a malign force. Also involved in this mess are Ezra (Tommy Chong), a tech savvy hippie who lives off the grid and realises all is not well along with Ward (Elliot Knight), a hydrologist who notices that the water is contaminated. Nathan's incompetence as a farmer is the butt of many jokes, when a TV team come to report on the meteorite he is described as an amateur farmer and bourbon connoisseur.But there is little other humour in the film apart from Cage going crazy, he starts off being a bit cranky but ends up not just chewing but literally devouring the scenery. This is a disturbing film, the menace starts off slowly but Ward's voice-over of the strange tree and hills and glens of the country near Arkham sets a sinister tone. The ineffable colour itself provides the Lovecraftian tentacles here as they reach out, smite and coerce. Scenes of savage violence and grotesque horror predominate in the latter part of Color as it proceeds to a grand guignol finale . Not a film for the squeamish or faint of heart.

At first, the family starts to do harmful things, like when the mom cuts off her own fingers, or when the young boy sits outside by the well all day. Eventually, the chaos builds, and insects and animals mutate into creatures. The most effective part of the movie was when the mother and her young son became fused together into something hideous. One by one, the characters are killed off in various ways, until the only survivor is a scientist who was there to survey the water.

45,I_Ailurophile,The horror of the unknown,10,2 January 2021,"This movie's low rating on this site surprises me.No, there's no Big Scary Killer dicing up bodies. No jump scares, not a great deal of gore. If that's what you want out a horror movie, great, but 'Color out of space' is about something much more esoteric and intangible. And that's why it's terrifying.(A bit of a disclaimer: I freely admit I've not read any Lovecraft. I'm well aware of him as a person, which is no small part of why I'm in no rush to read his stories. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate the style of horror that he's associated with, and which so many other people have taken to thrilling new places since.)I'm quite certain that my favorite director is John Carpenter. The way he creates atmosphere in his films, and builds suspense and tension, is far more exquisitely chilling than the best boogeyman that any dime-a-dozen gorefest might offer. One of many great examples, and a very relevant one here, is 'In the mouth of madness': the horror that unfolds has less to do with the victimization of the people in the story and is much more about the breaking of reality in inconceivable ways.That ""space,"" as it were, is where Richard Stanley plays in this astounding comeback. Mystery begets unease as strange occurrences unfold. Unease shifts into disquiet as the occurrences become more frequent, and more impactful. Disquiet becomes terror when those strange occurrences reshape reality into something entirely unknown and beyond comprehension.The entire cast is absolutely wonderful. Much has been made of Nicolas Cage's wild performances that often border on outrageous, but the incredible show he put on in 'Mandy' seems to have somehow refined his chops; as far as I'm concerned, he is perfect as the gradually unraveling Nathan. I'm personally just as impressed with Madeleine Arthur here, and Joely Richardson, Brendan Meyer, and all the others demonstrate no less skill.Speaking of 'Mandy'--it seems the same production team is behind 'Color out of space,' and it shows. One of many things about 'Mandy' that stood out to me was how lighting was expertly used to set the mood and build atmosphere throughout the picture, and the same is true here. That especially comes into play with the dazzling special effects, from the otherworldly Color to the Carpenter-esque creatures that the color shapes into being.In the more than 20 years since 'The Island of Dr. Moreau,' Richard Stanley effectively vanished from the public eye, if not entirely from the film industry. How much is this brilliantly crafted 'Color out of space' adaptation his brainchild? How much is to the credit of the people around him for the production? Whatever the case may be, they are all to be lauded, and in the very least, Stanley has definitely made a new mark as a director of feature films.It has plenty of chills and thrills, but this is not the sort of horror movie for everyone. Indulging in a light show is a different experience from riding a rollercoaster, and if gut-churning drops, loops, and turns are what you seek, then the mesmerizing spectacle of 'Color out of space' is maybe not for you. Yet that's kind of the point: If you're looking for something Obviously Wrong, you'll miss out on the unspeakable unknown that's beyond all understanding. A serial killer might end your life, but he can't fracture everything you thought you understood about reality.A gem. Even if it turns out it's not for you, you need to give this a chance.",Color Out of Space
46,aidanratesmovies,A Unique and rather Peculiar Magenta-Filled Nightmare,9,2 October 2020,"Clever, unique, and quite interesting- Color Out of Space may borrow from some other sci-fi flicks of similar nature, but there is never any true similarity to what this film develops and achieves- nor the story it accesses throughout. The film has a pretty decent cast, with Nicolas Cage obviously being the biggest name of the bunch. There was one moment in particular that I couldn't necessarily take his performance very seriously (a certain car scene), but for the most part he proves to be really good and chaotic throughout the film. Other standout performances include Madeleine Arthur, Elliot Knight, Tommy Chong, and Joely Richardson. This film is bizarre, to say in the least of words. What transpires throughout this film is truly a story unlike any other, and a sci-fi mystery setting that truly is interesting and unique to explore. There are similar formulaic tropes found throughout this film no doubt, and you are left with a bit more unanswered than truly solved, but I couldn't help but enjoy the flick and its qualities, especially its ambition alone. The magenta coloring pictures throughout is truly beautiful, horrifying, and breathtaking somehow all at once- and I admire the look and atmosphere this film develops and sets up, never feeling like the same film after each scene. Always growing, always changing. It's not for everyone, there are moments that are tough to follow, but somehow, though it has its challenges, I find this unique magenta nightmare quite enthralling to watch- and I hope to see more like it in the future.

48,truemythmedia,What Is Happening!?,10,27 February 2020,"Horror films like ""Color Out of Space"" are rare and many times hard to find. I don't know if I would have even heard of it if not for the cross section of two of my passing interests (H.P. Lovecraft and Nicolas Cage) happening to get some Venn Diagram synergy bonus to my perception check. I'm not enough of a fan of either of them for this movie to blip on my radar but with both of them coinciding it flew just high enough to get my attention.It's weird. It's trippy. Strange creatures, body horror, and cosmic glimpsing despair all add to its disturbing, intense, and skin-crawlingly discomfort and terror. It has Nic Cage doing both serious and insane acting and Tommy Chong (""Up In Smoke"") playing a hippie dude who seems right at home, squatting on Nicolas Cage's land in this film. The sound design churns and scrapes your nerves raw like chains dredging up a river for a dead body. It simply delivers everything I was hoping to find in this movie.I feel like I could end my review right there and the target audience will recognize this film for what it is... a transcendent exploration of the terror of the unknown in an indifferently powerful universe. So let's break it down now into what I think makes this film so special out of those above superlative compliments I just lay on so thick.Starting with Nic Cage (""Army of One""), I'll say that this is one of my favorite of his performances in recent years alongside the insane film ""Mandy."" Cage has a long history of acting insane on and off screen but also being a very good actor. He may make wild choices but that is because he is trying to push the boundaries of his performance the same way an athlete might push how fast they can run or high they can jump. Sure they may not always get a personal record but if they don't swing for the fences they never will. Cage swings hard every time and this film is no exception.In fact, I would say that this film is a great showcase for Cage's range.As his normal world unravels around him, his wife, and three kids, he runs the gamut from awkward dad of teenagers, loving and dutiful husband, angry and impatient father, fearful protector, crazy murderer, desperate whimpering fool, and of course, the weird crazy acting that Cage has occasionally allowed us to glimpse in films like ""Vampire's Kiss."" If you like Nic Cage for his range, insane tendencies, and interesting film selections then this one won't disappoint.When it comes to the way that this film induces terror, it doesn't rely on cheap tricks to make you startle although it doesn't eschew the practice entirely. Instead it uses a variety of methods to create an atmosphere that feels completely uncertain and wild. Just when you think you have a handle on what kind of insanity this alien presence is unleashing upon our family, the film surprises you with another level of unexpected strangeness that has you literally grabbing the arms of your theater seat when the scene changes as you wonder, ""Oh great! What's going to happen NOW?!I'll admit this may frustrate some audiences. Many times when I read or listen to people discuss horror that speak at length about how horror should be grounded in rules that are clear so that the audience knows what to be afraid of. If you don't know that a monster, for instance, can eviscerate you, then you won't be as scared if you do. This movie throws that kind of thinking out the window and says, "" Well what if there is no monster and what happens to you is so foreign and unknown that evisceration seems too grounded and familiar a thing to actually be scary anymore. There are moments in this film where you fully believe that the characters would take a known quantity any day of the week over what is happening, maybe not happening, or perhaps has already happened to them.If this seems like a scattered thought, that is somewhat intentional. It's scattered because it is about the unknown and it would be sort of silly if I was really able to nail down something like how this film tackles the unknown. Being able to speak clearly on it would be a clear indication that the film didn't really accomplish its goal.My favorite ways, and the ones that will probably get the most attention online, are the blending of special and visual effects, creative lighting, and fascinating sound and score mixes. If I could compare it to another exploration of insanity and isolation ""The Lighthouse"" this film is in many ways the opposite of that one. In ""The Lighthouse,"" Eggers employs mostly traditional camera techniques and lighting language to communicate the story of a man's unraveling sanity. He strips the film down till the tension is created mostly by the brilliant performances and stark setting. It is terrifying because it is so raw, real, and stomach dropping as realizing you are on an island with someone who is totally willing to kill you.""Color Out of Space"" on the other hand pumps the film full of color and sound that whirls in unnatural and unpredictable ways with just enough grounding to convince you it is real. The colors remind me of Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Only God Forgives"" or Harmony Korrine's ""Spring Breakers"" but the sense of insanity is more about how ungrounded it seems to be. It's not the fear of being killed. It's the fear of something worse than being killed happening to you. Something you can't even begin to fathom or imagine.The film unfortunately does have a couple weaknesses. The daughter, Lavinia, played by Madeleine Arthur (""Big Eyes"") is great in the latter half of the film but I really didn't care for her in the early stages of the film. I just found her way less believable as the pseudo Wiccan googly eyed crush driven brat that she is trying to play in that part of the film than the terrified little girl just trying to make it out with her family.There were also a few moments where the CGI didn't cut it for me. Not in the spectral universe exploration sequences or even the environmental and light effects but in some of the rendering of body effects that were either not done practically or sweetened enough in post that they lost their realistic grounding.Ultimately, these are nitpicks, though. None of these moments last long and there is so much going on and whirling in your head by the end of the movie that a few bad 3D models or a slightly wooden or under affected performance moment will hardly pull you out of the movie very far.If you are one of those people who are looking for an alternative to the popular horror, slasher, Conjuring 5: The Annnabelle Con-Nun-drum fare of the American cinema these days, ""Color Out of Space"" will have you rubbing your eyes squinting as the house lights come up and thinking ""I don't think I've experienced anything quite like that before.""",Color Out of Space
49,a_chinn,Wonderfully trippy H.P. Lovecraft adaptation from cult director Richard Stanley,8,10 January 2021,"Gonzo H.P. Lovecraft (""From Beyond"" ""Re-Animator"" ""Dagon"") adaptation by cult director Richard Stanley (""Hardware"" ""Dust Devil"") and the producers of ""Mandy,"" including that film's star, Nicholas Cage, in a much more subdued role (though really, even Cage in ""Wild At Heart"" could be described as a more subdued performance when compared to ""Mandy""). The film tells the story of a strange meteor landing on a remote farm that leads to cosmic repercussions. Most Lovecraft adaptations shy away from the cosmic and apocalyptic aspects of his stories, but Stanley takes them head on and it really makes me excited to see if Stanley gets to adapt another of Lovecraft's work (he stated that this was the first of a planned trilogy of Lovecraft adaptations). Also compared to other adaptations, ""Color Out of Space"" captures the author's oppressive and omnipresent sense of dread that he brought to a majority of his work. Stanley brings a terrifically an otherworldly feel to this seemingly ordinary farm, which includes Tommy Chong as an acid casualty neighbor with no shortage of wild thoughts about the universe and as weird as Chong seems, he does not seem out of place. Visually, the film is a stunner. The strange magenta lighting that engulfs the film gives it a surreal quality and was striking in making me realize how rare this color seems to be used in films. And SPOILER ALERT, the monstrous alpaca mutations are also awesomely disturbing and echoed John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in the best sort of way. Overall, ""Color Out of Space"" is an off-the-rails bonkers end-of-the-world story that audience members will likely either love or hate, so be forwarded going into this one.",Color Out of Space

51,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Adaptation of Lovecraft Story,8,2 February 2020,"Now I will admit I had seen a different adaptation of this H.P. Lovecraft story from Italy. That one had a much smaller budget and was called Colour from the Dark. I hadn't read the source material before my first viewing and have since before this second viewing. I did watch this with Jaime and she didn't know what to think. Regardless, this one excited me and I got the chance to catch this at the Gateway Film Center when it was in the theater for my first go. The synopsis is a town is struck by a meteorite and the fallout is catastrophic.We start this with Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur) as she is practicing what appears to be a Wiccan ritual and this is an interesting way to show that she wants out of this small area. She lives with her family out here. Her mother had cancer that caused the family quite the scare. She is doing this by a river that attracted Ward (Elliot Knight). Before we actually see Lavinia and what she's doing, there's a narration showing us the woods in the area and showing its haunting beauty. It explains that this is placed in Arkham which is a fictional area in New England portion of the United States.When he arrives, he spooks Lavinia and explains he's a hydrologist there to study the water table. Later there's an interesting reveal as there's a major project to create a dam and reservoir providing drinking water to a large area hence why he's there to test the water. Lavinia and Ward hit it off before she leaves on her horse and goes home.It is there we meet the rest of the family. Nathan (Nicolas Cage) is the father. They're living on the family farm that his father owned and raising alpacas. His wife is Theresa (Joely Richardson) who I'm assuming is a freelance investment banker that works out of the attic of this home. Benny (Brendan Meyer) is the eldest son and he's a bit of a pothead. There's finally Jack (Julian Hilliard) who is the younger son. We get a glimpse of their family dynamic over dinner.Things take a turn that night though when a meteorite hits in the front yard. It affects the family differently. Nathan starts to smell something that reminds him of the ward his father died in. Theresa starts to lose herself, Jack is drawn to it and then the well, thinking he's hearing someone talk to him. Ward gets involved to test the water and this brings him to encounter an off the grid hippie, Ezra (Tommy Chong). This meteorite brought a color that Nathan couldn't describe, but it also brought more than that.Now I wanted to introduce enough in my recap without spoiling this movie. I think that most people who are coming into this, have a rough idea of what could happen here, just maybe not necessarily how this movie is going to play out. I think through the screenplay and how things are introduced, we have a pretty deep story here that I dug.This version of it is closer to the source material in that we see the meteorite as it crashes here. After it does, the next night has a pretty strong storm that comes through. Lavinia is getting rained on and watching it. This draws her father outside and we see that the lightning keeps striking the meteorite, as if it is drawing it. This happens over and over again to the point where it's no longer there. We then see that it has contaminated the water in the well and from Ward discovers the whole supply.This is a fitting time for this movie to come out with this concept as well. I don't really want to take it political here, but it is fitting that at the time of writing this, regulations on testing water and certain precautions were lifted by the government. We briefly meet the mayor, Tooma (Q'orianka Kilcher) whose big plan for her term is to get this reservoir built. I love this apocalyptic backdrop that if what is happening isn't contained, it will spread. At the crux of this, we have kind of a body snatcher/alien takeover, infection type film. Not so much in the sense that they're trying to take over the world, but it is effecting all those that come in contact with it. It does change them as well.What I did like about this movie is that it briefly establishes the 'norm' for the family before things change. I think that quick baseline works. I hate to say this though, the only person I didn't really care for in this movie was Cage. I think he went too over the top too early and then he just gets weird. I do like that he's going back and forth as what this entity is doing is messing with him, but I feel he should have been a bit more normal. Lavinia is interesting as I saw some of my childhood in her where she is gothic-ish, but likes normal things. It is legit a phase for her in my opinion, much like for myself. Theresa is an odd character as well. I like they established her sad back-story, but I don't know if it is Richardson's performance as just too subdued or what, but she kind of fades into the background.Since I've already went into this, I did think that the rest of the acting was good. Knight is an interesting character for sure. We get a lot of fun Lovecraft references for those familiar, which includes Ward wearing a Miskatonic University sweatshirt, a Re-Animator reference. His name could reference Charles Dexter Ward and they're also in Arkham. I like that he's here as our investigator. I did have an issue is there's a long stretch where he disappears where it is established early that he's our 'hero'. Chong was fun in his appearance as Ezra. I like to think this is Cheech & Chong character who retired to this area and he's scared of the government while just living off the grid. Sheriff Pierce (Josh C. Waller) becomes important later in the movie, but he's never established which I found to be odd.Something that I hate to have to say is that after this initial viewing, I think that it runs a bit long. It gets right into introducing us to the characters and the event that changes everything happening. The movie really has a surreal feel to it and I'll get more into that during the effects and how this shot. I just felt the film meanders for a bit during the later second act. I like where it ended up though and the ending is interesting. Even after a second viewing, I think that it runs too long. The story is interesting, but I feel that there's just too much here that is unfocused for me.Since I touched on this, I thought that the effects were great. We get a lot of practical stuff which I'm always down for. I was so glad that Stanley was the director here, as I've seen his other two films Hardware and Dust Devil. Both of them I could see led to some of the odd creatures we get here, mostly from the former. There's a lot of CGI, but I personally thought it was used very well. We get electricity that is attacking people. We get some The Thing references with some creatures we see and the use of color is amazing. I wonder if Arthur was selected because normally she has beautiful eyes, but they're highlighted here later in the movie as well. The cinematography is also on point with all of this and I have to give a lot of credit there. Being this is same studio that did Mandy, I don't get a lot of those vibes. How this film looks when the entity is doing things, that's where I would reference it only.The last thing to cover is the soundtrack and sound design here. The big thing that struck out to me was the use of sounds for this entity. We get a scene with Ezra being on the ground claiming that he heard something talking in the night and then recorded it. It comes off as static and loud noises. What I like about this is that we are introduced to this with Jack. We take it as gibberish and nothing, but they're relaying that it is more. Later in the movie we get some music that made me feel uncomfortable and the scenes worked very well in conjunction with it. There are also animal sounds that draw characters which also worked for me as well.Now with that said, this is a movie that I really liked while having some slight flaws for me. I really like Stanley taking this Lovecraft story and adapting as he did. It is quite creepy the route that he took it. There are some slight issues I have which some from the acting and the pacing for a stretch of this. It does do some really good things with the concepts and social commentary. I thought the effects are on point and it is beautiful at times as well. The soundtrack and design were really good. I've already heard some people stating that only the pretentious will like this, but that's fine. It is still good in my opinion. It has come down for me after the second viewing, but still one of the better films of the year in my opinion.",Color Out of Space
52,begob,Accessible and incomprehensible,7,29 September 2020,"An isolated family is intruded on by a water scientist during his field work for a dam project, but then suffers a greater intrusion when something from space lands in their front yard ...The last time I looked through my fingers at a Lovecraft movie was Dagon, with Barbara's severed arms dangling gorgeously over the Cthulhu pit. So this time I was expecting something equally cheap and pointlessly mystifying. Wrong and wrong.This production has all the marks of quality, with a Spielberg-like set up of a lively family headed for horror in an American paradise. The cinematography is magnificent, the Color of the title radiating throughout, and the music and sound design awesome, starting off with a doom-laden, bone-crushing blast from a cosmic battle horn.The plot is arrow straight, and it's really the concept and technique that gave me stuff to chew over. Performances are good, and I do think Cage is suited to this: weird and wild, and if that's not your thing, then who invited you? But in the end I found, for all the production values and skilful editing, I still couldn't sit through the whole show in one go.A couple of things I only picked up on afterward. The colour magenta is a figment of our brains, completing a loop where nature has left it open - so it provides some deep cinematic content, but can't affect our experience of the story. And even if it did, the message is that we create the horror within ourselves - a very deep point I agree with, but not what this story seems to convey.Something more effective, though, comes in a scene toward the end, where the father appears to have lost his mind as he introduces his family in the living room - keep an eye out for a later scene in the same location, and it helps explain the nature of what's happening, and how the story twists time. And maybe the use of the magenta figment reinforces that point.I'm not a Lovecraft fan, I think because his stories leave humans passive and helpless, and so there's not much drama for me to get into. This movie helps by giving a conventional, although well made, set up; plus a firm outsider point of view; and the possibility of this thing being holistic - the intro puts science and mysticism in parallel, but then weaves them through the experience of cosmic what-the-hell.There's enough environmental references to suggest an angle on what is called the Chthulhucene (sic), which is basically an attempt by science and the humanities combined to get a handle on the great crisis we've brought on by our messing with nature. So the sequels to this will be even more interesting if they follow that line of thought, which would make me very happy to mark the whole thing up a notch or two.Overall: Accessible and incomprehensible.",Color Out of Space

Theresa is an economist and working from home in the attic and she recently beat cancer. One night something like a meteorite hit their garden and there was a glowing pinkish light everywhere. Electronic devices stopped working properly, they lost the notion of time and started acting strangely. Theresa cut off her fingers while cutting the carrots (reminded me of the scene from the Dark and the Wicked) and they left for the hospital. They came back and some light coming out of the well fused the mother and the little boy together and they seemed like they've come straight out of hell. They put the two on a mattress in the attic. Their reactions were a bit inappropriate like ""mom would you like some water?"" and so on. The hydrologist guy and an officer came over to the house after seeing the dead blob of many alpacas. Grass, trees, animals and everything using the water changed. They all went up to the attic and Nathan shot the both of them. And then the officer shot Nathan when Nathan aimed for the well with his rifle. The kids wanted to go away with the beautiful horse but it escaped. Benny got sucked into the well when he wanted to rescue the dog. Eventually the light from the well exploded leaving nothing but rubble and white dust behind. But the hydrologist who took refuge in the basement was alive because he hadn't drunk the water at all. During the explosion time was bent and Nathan started talking like his daughter and they were having the conversation they had a few days ago. It was a really creepy scene. But that he just got out of the collapsed house without a scratch was just a bit too far fetched. He survived and he said he'd never drink the water no matter what.

Nic Cage plays a semi-retired family man whose isolated upstate farm is struck by a meteorite, which then evaporates and causes all sorts of bizarre changes in the surrounding environment. Pink trees, mutated animals, unexpectedly abundant harvests, that sort of thing. Among the afflicted is Cage himself, who revels in the chance to amp up every last one of his craziest on-screen tendencies. My god, what a Cage-being-Cage film this is. He's howling, he's gesticulating, he's painted in blood and cackling, he's... suddenly and inexplicably changing accents? I'm not sure how much direction he took here, because it looks like they just focused the cameras and kept rolling while their star actor did whatever felt good, with the occasional interruption from family members or special effects showcases. And, as perversely entertaining as that can be, it doesn't merit a film unto itself. The scraps that surround those indulgent bouts of overacting are awfully scant, narrow and underdeveloped, like the worst '80s straight-to-video productions. It's trippy, but pointlessly so. We get cryptic prophecies and arcane imagery as props, mere window dressing that's waved around and then forgotten. Even the visuals can seem laughably dated, particularly the goopy, absurd creature effects.

One could even live with the idea that the phenomenon somehow ""creeps over"" that family (in every sense of the word) - by stealth and incrementally, so that at no point do they EVER behave AT ALL like any sensible or normal people would do when faced with this situation. But, hey, this is a family at whose head are people acted by ""specialists in the woolly"" Nicholas Cage and Joely Richardson, so we never get enough conviction or likeability or authenticity from these characters to allow us to forgive their oversights or indeed extend much sympathy. Likewise, the setting they live in this Richard Stanley movie is such that no authenticity or true grit comes out of that either.Basically, a world that is already wishy-washy becomes far more so because of a purple alien presence, but who really gives a damn?Answer on that would be - almost nobody even in the film scenario itself, as - despite the Mayor and the Police and the company seeking (thankfully) to drown the whole area under a dam-reservoir being aware of at least the problem's first phase - nobody does anything concrete at all. The armed forces and secret services and Homeland Security setup in the US employs many millions of people, but all have absented themselves from this movie - down to the last man or woman.So why should we waste our time either?",Color Out of Space

68,kuarinofu,Interesting experience,7,27 April 2020,"Color out of Space was a good film. It's not perfect in terms of story (unfocused and trying to have everything at once), pacing (slow/fast, random jump cuts), and has some character issues (no main character, randomly abandoned some of them, etc), but overall it is very atmospheric and immersive.It was beautifully shot, the soundtrack was great, the practical effects were good (while being very reminiscent of The Thing), cool sound design, and production design in general (courtesy of User T38).H. P. Lovecraft's adaptations are not the easiest ones to get to the big screen, mostly because of his concepts of ""unspeakable horror"" and the overall theme of something incomprehensible by the human mind. Color out of Space is very much such a concept. The film handles it rather well, but it still feels like more should've been left to the viewer's imagination just because you can't visualize something like this.The only real issue though was Nicolas Cage. I never thought I'd say this, but he felt miscast, annoying, and weird for the sake of it. I know that Nicolas Cage can't be ""unweird"", but still. The family is supposed to change under the influence of the meteorite, but Cage's character is already inhuman enough, so he doesn't really change throughout. Also, lots of scenes and dialogue felt like they were written for Cage to specifically riff off them. Stuff like ""Everybody loves ducks"" or ""You have to be very gentle..with..the...eh...boobs"" in the alpaca milking scene is probably fun in a different situation, but not in a Lovecraftian adaptation.An ok film, a great experience, a weird aftertaste.",Color Out of Space

In our new version Mr. Nicholas Cage breeds Alpacas, which is a fancy name for Llamas as far as I am concerned. Nick Cage, Llamas, and H.P. Lovecraft. A winning combination?Actually it's not too bad, if hardly good, and sort of follows the basic story, with some in-jokes. Cage's Wiccan daughter has a paperback of The Necronomicon and someone reads The Willows, by Algernon Blackwood. The 'Colour' effects are well done, although it goes for the Thing squishy body horror rather than the dry grey brittleness described by Lovecraft.There's a scene where a frantic Nick can't get his car to start, and what follows is pure Basil Fawlty - with Cage going mental on the car. Absolutely hilarious. A great guilty pleasure. It also features Tommy Chong as the old geezer in the shack, and his first action is to offer his visitors a hit of his bong!

73,anselmdaniel,It's just a color,7,27 March 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Color Out of Space is a 2019 science fiction cosmic horror movie. The movie is directed by Richard Stanley and is based on the short story ""The Colour Out of Space"" by H. P. Lovecraft. The movie stars Nicolas Cage, Joely Richardson, and Madeleine Arthur. A family in the outskirts of Arkham, Massacusetts encounters a strange otherworldly creature that lands in their farm.Color Out of Space is an impressive science fiction cosmic horror movie. This movie has a great plot in addition to great performances by the cast. The Color Out of Space that lands in the farm is such an otherworldly and strange object that it represents cosmic horror in its purest form. The pacing of this creature as it inadvertently terrorizes the Gardner farm and where the Gardner family's sanity slips abides by Lovecraft's writing.Nicolas Cage is an excellent casting choice in this movie. He nails the head of the family in how he wants to deal with the creature and how he wants to keep the family together. In addition as the family's sanity begins slipping Nicolas Cage portrays Nathan Gardner's insanity the only way that Nicolas Cage can. Nicolas Cage is unleashed in this movie and he really seems to be enjoying his role. It was a great choice to cast him. Madeleine Arthur is a pleasant surprise as the daughter of Nathan Gardner. She does portray the insanity of the Gardner family well and she does an excellent job in how she practices the occult. Those scenes were disturbing.Color Out of Space is a beautiful movie. I was not expecting a low budget movie to be this well-done and crafted. The visuals alone are wild and impressive to behold even on a small screen.

The atmosphere is creepy and sinister enough, the photography is great, and the acting is pretty good. But I cannot help it: my problem really is the story.It's about strange phenomena happening around this nice, a bit eccentric family, from the moment that a meteor lands in their garden. While we watch a dreadful and growing Evil Presence looming in the shadows of the farm, things with the family gradually deteriorate, everyone gets emotionally and physically affected, up until the point where insanity takes over. This may sound as a fascinating and sinister story (which it is), but we never really get into the flow of a real narrative. It's just one weird happening after another, getting more and more terrifying, but there is never anything like even a hint of an explanation. I know that it's very en vogue in nowadays horror movies to leave the audience in the dark about the who, why and what for, suggesting probably that you thus take the created uneasiness and fear back home to linger a little bit longer in your head. But you also take home a nasty sense of frustration, at least I do.Anyway, I kept watching in the hope that it would go to some sort of satisfying closure (it doesn't), so in itself the movie was capable of keeping me on the edge of my chair. Which is a good thing. As I said, the acting is mostly fine, with Nicholas Cage for once not as a macho hero or the one who saves the day, but as a very unstable and emotionally overwrought father, and in this case his blatant over-acting actually suited his part perfectly.",Color Out of Space
79,Aylmer,even worse than MANDY - an assault on the audience,3,26 September 2021,"Richard Stanley returns to directing features after a decade in hiatus with this awkward, slow-paced turkey of a horror movie.While he was away, Stanley obviously watched a lot of M. Night Shyamalan movies in preparation as this film suffers from a lot of the same problems. Practically nobody in the film (besides the visiting water test guy) behaves like an actual human being. Granted they're all slowly losing their minds because there's something in the water, but the movie can't really ever decide what to do with them.There's a lot of body horror thrown in, the likes of which we haven't really seen since THE THING or LEVIATHAN. However, when presented with horrific gestalts, the characters in this film just sort of deal with it and hang out rather than putting anyone immediately out of their misery.If you haven't already guessed, this film shares a similar color pallet with other recent Cage vehicle MANDY, and it's similarly old school in presentation but awkward in its attempts to modernize. While there are plenty of well-composed visuals throughout, I can in now way call this film a pleasant experience. You can say that is exactly what it was going for, but it's just too tedious to really even get drawn in enough to get repulsed properly when the bad things happen. Overall I suspect that Stanley made this movie simply to troll the audience or laugh at people finding meaning from a thoroughly meaningless film.

I'm happy to say that ""Color Out of Space"" might just be the best Lovecraft screen adaptation ever. Also being a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, this project was on my radar from the very beginning & above all, it's the resurrection of Richard Stanley's career.""Color Out of Space"" is a visceral, eerie and, well, quite the bonkers horror movie with all kinds of oddities, awesomeness and even humor sprinkled all over it. The movie starts off (and ends) with a narration by the character of Ward Philipps (see what they did there?), the first half might seem a little too slow for some, but it's a pretty crucial mood-setter. We get introduced to the Gardner family, each of their wishes, ambitions, problems, emotions, soon enough the meteorite comes and all slowly goes to hell. Masterfully so. Plot-wise it's not very substantial and thank god for that - Richard Stanley tried to harness from Lovecraft's story all the right ingredients, the irrational fear, sticky atmosphere, the eeriness and limitless void of the unknown. The cast provides great performances, especially the man of the hour Nicolas Cage, the role fit him like a glove. For everyone who likes the crazy Cage, ""Color Out of Space"" is a must-see. And, of course, a must-see for all the Lovecraft admirers as well. Richard Stanley's first full feature since 1996 also stands out in the technical and aesthetical departments, the cinematography, editing & production design provides a vivid, visceral and just plain beautiful visual atmosphere, topped off with the talented composer Colin Stetson's (""Hereditary"") haunting score. And mad props to the FX team, both the practical parts and the cgi was nailed, given the fact that this is indeed an indie horror, a top-tier B flick.Of course, in full honesty, while ""Color Out of Space"" is undeniably awesome, it does have its flaws, the pacing might be a little too slow at times, maybe too much comedy on Alpacas, but my only personal complaint is that slightly annoying feeling somewhere in the back of the mind that states the movie's true potential wasn't fully realized.

Because the characters are so vapid and unlikeable, all the character development in the early parts of the movie feels like time wasted, and thus so does the entire first half of the movie.The movie reminds me of Donnie Darko in the sense that if I had seen this when I was an 18 year old stoner, there's a good chance I would have found it really profound and would have convinced myself there was a lot more to take from it. A meteorite lands in this family's yard, but other than that there is virtually no plot, and there is never anything more than takes form, so I can't really sing accolades for the writing either. Nothing that happens really ties to anything else, and not much makes sense. Nothing about the cinematography, directing, pacing, or acting really stands out either.The one strength the movie does carry, which is enough to give it it's niche 6 out of 10 rating, is it's blatant ambition, mostly carried out through some really wild special effects and almost Clive Barker-esque mutations. There were some genuinely impressive and disturbing looking images which most will not forget.

In time, near the end we see strange alien creatures that infuse themselves to humans and animals. Add to this the ground water is tainted. What else can go wrong? Huh?Probably the worst science fiction story I have ever watched. There is no resolution to stop the strange happenings that involve the whole family. But yes, there is a resolution, but it is for the Aliens. The father, Nathan Gardner (Nicolas Cage) doesn't believe his children when they try to tell him things are not right where they are on the land. Even when his wife Theresa (Joly Richardson) chops off the tips of 2-fingers cutting carrots he isn't convinced of anything. He escapes into his booze.The word ""Horror"" is mentioned when telling what the movie is all about. I didn't find that to be true. Hey, it's a Nicolas Cage movie and it can't be that bad. When aliens or the scent of them is possible in a movie I don't see any horror in that. Okay, okay, ""ALIENS"" excepted, of course.The acting is very good even though the story lacks many things like a good plot and a resolution for humans. We don't feel any tension or suspense. We know the meteor is causing all the descent in the family and the animals too, Alpacas and the dog. And we constantly see weird colors. Stupid title, too.Watch if you like.Notables: Madeleine Arthur as Lavinia, Nathan's daughter and the only one we see that has any common sense about everything that is happening, but she does dabble in the Occult and does spells; Brendan Meyer as Benny, eldest son and who gets stoned in the beginning; Julian Hilliard as Jack, the youngest son, who is curious about everything; Elliot Knight as Ward, the Hydrologist who comes to test the ground water at the Gardner farm.There is another (a good one) resolution at the very end, but will it hold? (3/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: Nathan and Theresa try in the dark, but we see nothing and that is when the meteor hits.

101,Bertaut,"A solid adaptation, albeit with a bit too much alpaca-based comedy",7,11 November 2019,"Written and directed by Richard Stanley (his first film in 25 years, after he was infamously fired three days into production on his long-gestating dream project, The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996)), Colour Out of Space is a modernised adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's 1927 short story ""The Colour Out of Space"", and takes a good stab at depicting one of Lovecraft's most oblique entities. Mixing humour and body horror (perhaps weighed a little too much towards humour), the film gives Nicolas Cage another opportunity to go full-Cage, and boy does he lean into it - this is the most ludicrous, histrionic, and borderline farcical performance he's given since Vampire's Kiss (1988), and how much latitude you give him may well determine your opinion of the movie.Just outside the city of Arkham, MA (the fictitious setting of many Lovecraftian stories), Nathan Gardner (Cage), his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), and their children Benny (Brendan Meyer), Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), and Jack (Julian Hilliard) have moved into Nathan's deceased father's property, with Nathan embracing rural life by raising alpacas on the property's farm. On an otherwise normal night, the sky fills with pulsating light and a meteorite crashes onto the Gardners' land, and as time passes, the Gardners start to experience ever-more bizarre events - unnaturally localised lightning storms that seem to come from nowhere; huge fuchsia-like plants that seem to grow overnight; a horrific odour that only Nathan can smell; a gigantic purple mantis flying around; radios and the internet cutting out more than normal; the water turning strange colours; the family's dog, Lavinia's horse, and Nathan's alpacas starting to acting strangely; even time itself appears to be corrupted. And soon enough, the family members themselves begin to show signs of unnatural change.After some basic narrative preamble and a contemplative sub-Terrence Malick-style voiceover, the film features one of the most inorganic expositionary scenes I've ever seen, as Nathan and Theresa stand on the porch, and spend a good five minutes telling each other things that they both already know. Thankfully though, the clunkiness of this opening isn't a sign of things to come, and one of the film's most consistent elements is the subtlety with which Stanley depicts the entity, or rather, doesn't depict it. Lovecraft felt that if humanity were ever to encounter real cosmic beings, they could be so unlike anything in our experience as to be impossible to describe, or even process in our minds, and one of his aims with ""Colour"" was to create an entity that doesn't conform to human understanding - hence the only description is by analogy, and even then, only in relation to a colour beyond the visual spectrum. With this in mind, Stanley wisely keeps everything as vague as possible - vibrant, modulating pulses of light that seem to be emanating from somewhere just outside the frame, vaguely-defined spatial distortions, colour manipulations with no obvious source, etc.Important here is the colour itself, and instead of attempting to create the indescribable colour featured in the story, director of photography Steve Annis chooses to go the route of not settling for any one stable colour - every time we see the effects of the meteorite, the hue appears to be in a state of flux - so although we can say the colours are recognisable, they're never identifiable as any one specific colour, which, is probably the best choice the filmmakers could have made.As we get into the third act, the film abandons all sense of restraint and goes completely insane, with the body horror which has threatened to break through from the earliest moments finally unleashed, foregrounding the exceptional work of special effects supervisor/creature designer Dan Martin. These scenes are heavily indebted to David Cronenberg, especially his earlier work such as Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), and The Brood (1979), although the most obvious touchstone is Chris Walas's work on Cronenberg's masterpiece, The Fly (1986). A lot of Martin's creature design also seems inspired by the legendary work of Rob Bottin, and there's a direct visual quote of one of the best moments in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982).It's also in the last act where Cage is turned loose, signalled by an epic meltdown when he discovers Benny hasn't closed the barn door and the alpacas have gotten out. From there, it's Nicolas Cage unrestrained. There is a problem with this, however. Full-Cage has been seen in films such as Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off (1997), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009), Mom and Dad (2017), and Mandy (2018), but each performance has felt fairly organic, never becoming self-conscious. In Colour, however, to an even greater extent than in the virtually unwatchable The Wicker Man (2006), Cage crosses into self-parody, with his performance having as much to do with people's preconceived notions of a Nicholas Cage performance as it does with finding the character. There are a couple of scenes here that seem to have little to do with legitimate character beats and more to do with Cage winking at the audience.Which might be entertaining and all, but which doesn't serve the film especially well. For all its insanity, this is a relatively serious movie, but Cage's performance is so manic, that it affects everything around it. For example, after the aforementioned meltdown (""Don't you know how expensive those alpacas were""), which just about fits with what we know of the character, as Nathan is walking away from Benny and Lavinia, he stops, turns, pauses, shouts ""ALPACAS"", pauses again, and then walks away. This got a huge laugh at the screening I attended, and it was undoubtedly funny. But does self-reflexive humour by the leading man help tell the story or even create the right tone? No, not in the slightest. In essence, this scene marks the point where the character ceases to be Nathan Gardner and becomes a version of Nicolas Cage.The other characters all have a kind of internal logic to their crumbling sanity; the meteorite affects each of them differently, with their minds disintegrating in different, but consistent ways. With Nathan, however, Stanley seems unwilling, or unable, to establish the parameters by which his mind is breaking down, seemingly going for laughs rather than something more cogent.This issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed Colour Out of Space a great deal. Stanley's return to the director's chair is to be admired for its restraint and how faithful it remains to the very tricky Lovecraftian original. The body-horror in the film's last act will appeal to fans of the grotesque, whilst others will take great pleasure from Cage's insanity, as narratively unjustified as it is. The film is ridiculous on many levels, but it's extremely well realised and well made, and is to be applauded for not trying to attach an explicit meaning to a story which avoids any kind of thematic specificity.",Color Out of Space

They just plop them into the scenario, and expect you to feel bad for them automatically.
Why does this family feel like they have nobody they are close to? It's almost like they live off the grid, but they don't. The only outsiders that talk to them is that hydrologist guy. Who disappears for a large chunk of the movie, strange considering it seemed like the movie was supposed to be largely his POV.
And what was the point of having Tommy Chong in this film? They could have edited him out and it wouldn't have affected the plot. His only reason for being there was so they could make a joke about a cat named 'g-spot' who turns up dead later.
So this isolated family has a meteor land on their property, the mayor comes to see it. What was the point of that? It seemed like it was a set up for something, because she appears on the TV later, but nope, another dead end. The TV camera comes later, the only other outsider interested in the family's story. Strangely, no government scientists who would want to analyze a space meteor?!!
As this movie progresses, it feels familiar, like Annihilation meets John Carptenter's The Thing meets Evolution (that horrible comedy from Ivan Reitman).

A lot of nonsense and you'll end up scratching your head if you allow yourself to think about what you've just seen.Objectively I also found the editing and pace WAY OFF, scenes seem to be just mashed together and made for very confusing storytelling, and this was almost 2 hours long! Makes me think that there is a cut of this out there that's a lot longer but could possibly make a heck of a lot more sense.I am from the crowd of people that have never read the book so I went into this movie holding no knowledge of what to expect, and in turn things happen and characters do/or do not react in certain ways, it gets very ""eh??, why??"". I'll give one example.SPOILER AHEAD:At one point where things are getting messy, Lavinia opens up her book of the necronomicon to carve symbols into her body and perform some ritual. Now, why she has this book and it's relevance to why and how it is important is unclear as I think we see the actual book in two or three quick shots and then we as an audience are just left to assume it is important in some way but without any story.And then the ending, Lavinia gets possessed by the colour (spelled with a U because that's how it's supposed to be) and I THINK she now has ""witch powers"" and uses the spells and symbols on her body to send the purple thing into the sky? Space? Back to its home planet? No idea, like I said - I haven't read the book.So yeah, that's one example of things that happen which you'll tilt your head and be all ""Wha-T??"" If you do not have prior knowledge of the book.SPOILER OVER.Having said that I found the acting to be decent and it has some wonderfully horror'like qualities in an Evil Dead kind of way, which I really liked.

106,d_m_s,Well directed but a bit dull and too long,6,7 September 2021,"I really liked how this film was directed, it had style without being flashy.Nic Cage stands out like a sore thumb and steals the show, making all the other characters seem dull next to him. I guess that's a risk you take when you put Cage in a film. It's not that he or his character are particularly brilliant in this, it's just that he's better (or, at least, more entertaining) than the rest. He's probably better in films where he's the sole character like in Mandy, rather than as part of a family unit (though he is more toned down in the excellent Mom & Dad and he works well in that).The film was over-long with unnecessary characters. The squatter, for example, added nothing at all. His scenes could have been edited out and the film would not have lost anything at all and would have in fact gained from being a bit shorter. The hydrologist guy, he felt like a significant character but again by the end I'm wondering if he could have been taken out too. He felt like an under-developed character who should have made more of an impact.The story was OK at first but I lost interest after a while.

Lovecraft's short story of the same name originally published in 1927. I'm not acutely aware of Lovecraft's stories so I can't confirm whether it is a true adaptation or a re-telling of sorts. However, this film is really well done. It's a type of cosmic sci-fi/horror that I don't see much lately, but which always gets me intrigued and craving more. The film is incredibly creepy. It doesn't rely on gore and guts so much but rather on atmospheric tension, which I really appreciate. The special effects are....just amazing. I love the use of saturated colors to reflect the changes throughout the film and those whom are watching closely will notice that the level of saturation and change in colors and hues represents the various levels of heightened terror. It's these little nuances and touches that really set the tone of the film and keep you engaged the whole time. The acting is OK for the film. This is an indie film so I don't expect it to be perfect and it's not, but that's fine. Nicholas Cage is every bit is unhinged as you expect him to be. He's fantastic.

113,mackjay2,"Lovecraft, but not really",2,22 February 2020,"Yet another attempt at adapting Lovecraft. Like most others, it seriously misses the mark by not getting what makes Lovecraft unique. His writing combines profound dread with alien strangeness. It's dark and extremely atmospheric. It would seem perfect material for film adaptation. But one big problem is the author's language--we do get a taste of that in the brief narration in this movie--it's over-the-top purple prose much of the time. Lovecraft used words like eldritch and cyclopean as though they were heard everyday by any reader. As compelling and downright haunting as his best work is, it really lives in his language, in his descriptions of cosmic horror, of unnameable things, of ancient, malevolent beings who see humans as mere pawns in their attempt to regain control of the Earth. That said, it's not a film maker's fault that it's impossible to bring language, words on a page, to life on a screen. This is because Lovecraft doesn't describe action so much as he does psychological states or feelings of horror and dread. So a film maker has to visualize Lovecraft's concepts and it's not easy. THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE is a standout in the author's work, not necessarily because it's a masterpiece (which it may, or may not be in one's opinion) but because it has only tenuous connection with Lovecraft's major conceit which became known as the Cthulhu Mythos. It's up to a reader whether it's part of that group or a standalone story. To me it's standalone and that could make it a good choice for movie adaptation, since it doesn't need to show us the gigantic, monstrous beings waiting in space, or in the depths of the ocean. It's about an unexplained meteorite that crashes into the yard of a New England farm in the middle of nowhere and turns everything and everyone into something alien.You may say, well that's what happens in this film. On the surface, yes it does. But there is none of Lovercaft's ""poetry"" in this movie--and I don't mean his language, but rather the dark, brooding atmosphere of dread that sticks in the reader's mind. This film is brightly lit most of the time, there are surprisingly few night scenes. It's beautifully shot, often striking in color (yes, an attempt at one no human has ever seen) and compositon. The special effects, while not exactly original, are alright. But many people are loving this because they like seeing Nicholas Cage go berserk...and indeed he does, if that's your thing. The screenplay is not terribly well written and there are lapses of continuity, as though cuts were made for time in a rush before release. The acting in general is ok at best, with no standout.

114,RogerBorg,Solid and respectful adaptation,8,17 November 2020,"It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by a film. Color Out of Space delivers a faithful rendition of Lovecraft's short story and is well worth the time for any fan of the original.It's founded on two very talented leads who know their craft and give sound performances as people slowly, gradually, losing their minds and their humanity. The small supporting cast do a fair job too, there are no weak links here. Even Tommy Chong's performance as, well, Chong, isn't too big a disjointPacing is fine, with just the right amount of scene setting and character introduction to give you a reason to care about them, and a long, gradual ramp up of the titular eldritch color corrupting the backwoods setting. There are some genuinely unsettling scenes that achieve their impact not just through visual effects, but also disturbing diegetic sounds.What I really appreciate is that screenwriter / director Richard Stanley and co-writer Scarlett Amaris clearly get Lovecraft, and fully commit to it. The great thing about the Cthulhu mythos is that it just doesn't care about humanity or our delusions of significance, and Stanley nails that here. Nothing protects you: not being a cute kitty, or a good doggo, not being an autistic ally, not technology, not nature worship, not even magic. This is Lovecraft done right.Where it stumbles just a little is towards the ending which is slightly too overblown and effects heavy.

The mysterious rock seems to sink into the Earth, and hereby seriously affecting everyone and everything around it - including time and space.If you're a fan of some bonkers sci-fi horror that mostly doesn't make sense, you'll dig all of the craziness that's waiting for you. While nature and animals mutate into bizarre deformed creatures and spout purple rays of radioactive light, this family has to fight separately and save themselves from killing each other under the influence of this ""color out of space"".There's some awkward exposition regarding the family in the first half hour of the film that just doesn't work as an emotional back drop. The film would've worked better if the story focused more on the daughter of the house, Livinia (Madeleine Arthur - To All the Boys I've Loved Before), who has an interesting back story that involves an obsession with witchcraft and the Necronomicon. Instead we focus a bit too much on the bigger star of the film, Cage, who doesn't really bring anything else than his ""crazy shtick"", which felt much more deserved and honest in 'Mandy', but doesn't really fit here, and becomes a bit tiring at a certain point. It goes completely off the rails when Mr. Gardner's newly adopted herd of Alpacas seem more important than his own children, while putting up a weird Trump-impersonation. If this was intentional, job well done, if not, it was too much.Joely Richardson as the wife/mother is clearly miscast and can't keep up with Cage's level of insanity, as soon as their house gets surrounded by this mysterious cosmic cloud. There is a moment of body horror in which she gets to shine, and can count as one of the more shocking scenes in the film.The film's tone feels too uneven to be considered enjoyable, even to the extent of becoming frustrating with a running time of almost two hours. Colin Stinton's synth-score shamefully gets buried by the extreme amount of sound effects. While there's no doubt a lot of the budget was spent on the impressive set design, it's no excuse for the cheap looking VFX which really take you out of some of the more scarier scenes. This would've been so much more effective by the use of practical effects.Sci-fi horror has seen a resurgence in recent memory with hits such as Annihilation and Prometheus, but this trashy B-film doesn't work as a whole.

At first it seems like a mysterious and harmless discovery; but soon its extraterrestrial effluence seeps into the environment, contaminating the flora and fauna, and targeting the minds of its nearby occupants...Adapting a Lovecraft short story is no easy task. His writing is mostly description and explained by a narrative voice with little dialogue. Writer-director Richard Stanley does a fine job of creating characters from a piece of fiction that offers little to extract in terms of characterisation, while updating the source material for the modern era.'Color Out of Space' is a slow-burn, easing you into the lives of people whose existence will soon be altered forever by something otherworldly and hostile. The landscape becomes drenched in pink; a colour that has never looked so hypnotic and malevolent before now.Thanks to strong direction and terrific sound design, this science fiction horror establishes an atmosphere so thick it's almost choking. The film builds towards an unforgettable conclusion of Carpenter-esque nightmare fuel, complete with gruesome body horror and a sinister synth score.Overall, 'Color Out of Space' is a treat for genre fans, featuring a typically crazy Nic Cage performance (who's in his element when descending into insanity), a well-crafted narrative that creeps under the skin and stays there, and grotesque imagery that just gets nastier as the film goes on.

And the end is jumbled but spectacular at the same time. Cage was more uneven than usual here. Some of his choices are so jarring.

A family who've relocated from the big city to their rural farmhouse while dealing with their matriarch recovering from cancer, begin to experience strange occurrences when a meteorite lands in their yard. A refreshing change from the usual representations of Alien life as humanoid or cephalapod etc, this really portrays an entirely different kind of extra terrestrial invasion.
Very Lovecraftian but with elements of Carpenter's The Thing and other Sci fi influences, this film is visually stunning and becomes more and more psychedelic as it progresses.

Superb acting all round but an outstanding performance by Nicholas Cage. The drama is reasonable but I never got to care about the characters. I wouldn't chose to spend time getting to know them in real life. The only likeable character is the Hydrologist.
There are some good moments of scare and suspense but what really makes it stand out is the special effects. The post processing effects that cost little but make it unique. Very artistic! I can also complement the make-up department on a splendid job.

This filmmaker followed neither...
Meteors from space crashes on earth and brings a Pink Floyd light show full of special effects creatures from The Thing...It was probably scary 50+ years ago, but these days it just seems lazy and contrite.
The characters were terrible, they had no chemistry or believeAbility as people, even less as a family. Cage phones in his typical ""I'm a babbling weirdo"" performance, which grows more painful to watch every movie. In this movie he's his typical unhinged, unwatchable self.
The only actors worth watching in this were the unknown water surveyor guy and tommy Chong, who played his stereotypical hippy dippy weirdo.
I can only imagine any positive reviews must have come from reviewers paying respect to the tradition of the story itself, because the movie was visual and audio garbage.
For all the trouble this alien seemed to have went to getting to earth, it basically kills a few folks, then beams itself back into space...the end makes no logical sense, it was just an exercise in how special effects creators could imagine what it would be like if they had been cool enough to take hallucinogens.
There is no real end, just flashing lights, then the final character smoking a cigarette and babbling profound nonsense.

That's pretty much the movie. I haven't read the short story by H.P. Lovecraft in years, so how faithful it is I don't know off the top of my head, but it hit all the right marks. Mystery, aliens, strange colors and sounds, and a family situation going south real fast.I think the most positive thing I found in this, honestly, was that none of the characters irritated me. Everybody was pretty well put together and believable. The movie was devoid of stupidity. I can't stand sci-fi horror films filled with idiots. I was locked in for the run time and was almost just creeped out enough. It's more scifi than horror so the film is largely devoid of any, edging around corners, anxiety inducing, moments or jump scares. The sounds and cinematography were well done.I have mixed feelings about Nicholas Cage's character as the father. Nick seems incapable of delivering normal human speak so he's either mildly weird or he's at an 11/10. This time around his normal is within reason so I found him tolerable and his crazy person fit the film perfectly when it was time to do that. In my head I can picture a couple actors that might have done a better job of balancing the normal and crazy, but would they have been able to bring the crazy like nick? I'm not so sure.I wanted to give this movie a 7/10 because I'm not leaving the theater feeling like it made an impression me, but a 7 feels low.

This movie has all his standard trademarks, but is not marred with a slow, convoluted story or troublesome production and studio interferences. This is a simple story that gets infused with cosmic horror/terror. This might be his best work to date.The cinematography, music, sound design, screenplay, even the acting is all on point. Nicholas Cage does a good job, and he goes full Nic Cage only when the movie needs him to. Tommy Chong is fantastic, as is basically every character. The colors are all turned up to 11, making for a unique cinematic experience that every movie/horror/sci-fi/HPL buff needs to make time for. It's like 'Mandy', but with stronger and more trippy colors.Glad Richard Stanley is back to making the movies he wants to make.

He's not the greatest writer in the world, but he was not afraid to go over the top is his depictions of horror. Or at least the effects of seeing and experiencing horrible things on his characters. When his human characters behold one of the horrific creatures, you don't so much ""see"" the creature as see how insane the character has been driven by their encounter. It's pretty creepy stuff.THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE does a good job of capturing that feeling. (f you know the original story, set during the mid-1700s...this retelling is in modern times, but is somehow surprisingly faithful). We meet a family of 5, mom (Joely Richardson), dad (Nicolas Cage), older brother, middle sister, younger brother. They live in a lovely old house out in the country...a place they've moved into recently and haven't quite adjusted to. One night this family has an object from outer space crash land in their front yard. It's sort of like a meteorite, but not quite. It's magenta, for one thing. And eventually it causes all sorts of horrible things to happen. All sorts.I won't go into detail, because a big chunk of the fun in this film is seeing all the ways the director & writer (Richard Stanley) and his crew have devised to scare you. Except it's not really scary...but some of it is deeply disquieting, and that's worse, somehow. Things happen to some of the characters that are just...wrong. In some cases, deeply wrong. You are made to look at things that just make you a little queasy.And if you ever wanted an actor to go insane, and didn't care about subtlety, you sure can't do worse than Nicolas Cage. He's off his rocker here, but it works in the entire nutty atmosphere of this film. My only issue with him is that at the beginning of the film, even his ""normal"" isn't right. Not for ONE second does he feel like he's comfortable living in this farmhouse or even being the father of these kids. Cage can't really act ""normal"" anymore, so Stanley spins that into ""this guy just isn't quite right. There's something that's slipped a little loose in his head."" So then, when the horror begins, having all that break loose makes lots of sense.It's a typical horror film in many ways. Too many characters are asked to do things that don't really make sense. Much of the dialogue is clunky. And like the films of the '70s it sort of honors, some of it is just cheesy when it should be scary. BUT, there's plenty that is scary. The sound mix on the blu-ray will ultimately put your surround sound through its paces. And the use of light, particularly magenta, is quite effective.Throw in Tommy Chong in a small role, and you've got the makings of a slight but somehow unforgettable & unique experience.

It premiered at TIFF last year but had a brief wide release this year. Lovecraft movies are very hit or miss. Aside from the films of Stuart Gordon, like Re-Animator and From Beyond, no one has really succeeded in making a really good one. His stuff is hard to adapt because a lot of it is short, not easy to adapt into a feature. Also, a lot of the imagery in his stories is intentionally impossible to visualize. That, and his stuff has tons of casual racism in it, even for the time it was written. Color Out of Space is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations out there. It updates the story to a modern setting and it adapts one of his least racist stories, like Stuart Gordon did with Re-Animator. However, unlike Re-Animator, I don't think this movie will be remembered as a classic. The acting isn't that great, with the exception of a good old crazy performance from Nicolas Cage. The effects are well-done, it's bloody and intense and of course it's very colourful, but overall there just isn't really much that's memorable or stand-out about it. It's a solid horror movie, but that's about it. I hear the director wants to do other Lovecraft adaptations like The Dunwich Horror and I think that's great. The movie actually kind of sets up a possible Lovecraft cinematic universe that could be worth exploring and I will gladly watch out for, but I still don't think this movie is the masterpiece that Lovecraft fans have been waiting for. While I don't think it's great and I don't think people will be watching this movie over and over again like Re-Animator, I think this is still worth checking out for horror and sci-fi fans, especially Lovecraft fans.",Color Out of Space

161,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,The Return of Richard Stanley + Vampire Kiss Nicolas Cage,7,19 August 2020,"Color Out Of Space ReviewA strange meteor strikes the Gardner family farm causing apocalyptic consequences.Color Out Of Space is a solid return to form for Richard Stanley directing feature films. H.P. Lovecraft's original short story, The Color Out Of Space, is motivated by mood, not character, which makes it a difficult story to adapt. Stanley gives a careful and meticulous adaptation of Lovecraft's story, even though the film does not take itself too seriously at all.He uses the core story from the source material and adds autobiographical elements and his own sense of humor to it. It essentially fills out all the other colors in the spectrum for the film, pun intended. For example, Lavinia, the daughter character, is a Wiccan; Richard Stanley practices witchcraft in real life.There's a strange in-joke going on with Alpacas and how the majority of people are oblivious to them being a source of milk. Every time Nicolas Cage utters the word ""alpaca"", there's an over-inflection on the word and it's delivered with this wink to the audience like they are in on the joke. That aspect of films having obscure twisted messages hidden by the director for people to find is something I gravely miss from films now. That's the kind of humor this film is operating on and I ate it all up.The final results are part H.P Lovecraft, part Richard Stanley, part B-movie midnight horror and part Nicolas Cage. The strongest parts were all in the first half where the film was building up its mood and delivering a sense of foreboding. You don't know what's happening and there seems to be a bigger mysterious force at play beyond the characters' comprehension, and it's effectively creepy. The short story reads that way as well and Stanley does a great job recreating that creepy slow-building mood for the screen.The choice of bright magenta for being ""the color"" is a great choice. In the short story, the color is described as indescribable and is outside the visual spectrum of humans, which is quite a conundrum in a visual medium. Magenta is not the color I would associate with being scary. Whenever magenta shows up, things get both trippy and unsettling as it burns brightly and screams onscreen.When the chaos starts happening, the film was less interesting because it felt like glimpsing behind the magician's curtain, seeing what was going on and losing a sense of the mystery. That's where the B-movie horror element comes in and while some of those gore moments are darkly funny, things become predictable. The laughs undercut the scares at times, but I suppose it's part of the impending insanity of it all. Watching this film with a midnight madness audience would gravely enhance the latter parts, so I do recommend seeing it with company.Nicolas Cage incorporates an array of acting styles, starting off more nuanced at the beginning and tunes it to theatrical as his character Nathan descends into madness.When Cage goes ""full Cage"", he redoes a familiar craziness by whipping out that weird faux American British mixed posh accent he did in Vampire's Kiss. It is self-parody but a planned intentional self-parody. It is as if Cage is drawing upon one of his famous performances to build a language with the audience on a whole another level.The standout is Madeleine Arthur, who plays the daughter Lavinia, who acts as the emotional anchor and the glue holding the film's various tones together. Arthur's genuine reaction to the meteor and the strangeness that's happening around her keeps the film moody and scary.Color Out Of Space will probably play best for midnight madness horror fans with popcorn tossed in the air shrieking and laughing through it together. While I suspect it's not where Stanley's true sensibilities lie, the B-movie midnight madness horror is a great way to package his films as a commercial element and it fits his forté very well. For the H.P. Lovecraft fans, it will be a question of whether they can go along with Richard Stanley and Nicolas Cage's quirky sense of humor.Film fans who are unfamiliar with Richard Stanley's story can check out Lost Souls: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley, the documentary about the disastrous 1996 production of The Island of Dr. Moreau. Stanley was fired off the film, lived in the Australian jungle, and snuck his way back into the production as an extra.Stanley is a fascinating writer-director and it's great to know he's making feature films again. In the film festival press circuit, he spoke of wanting to adapt two more H.P. Lovecraft stories and make his own H.P. Lovecraft trilogy as his next future project.

Most of the time, however, they lose all traction at some point and it gets more embarrassing by the minute. This film is like that too. It is simply bad. Apart from the confused story about some alien forces coming to earth in the form of colours and spherical apparitions, it's once again the equally horrible acting of Nicolas Cage.

All of which makes ""Color Out of Space"" a huge letdown, right from the surprisingly inept opening scene: a flat, forested landscape of tall, healthy timber, one that looks nothing like the sinister hills and ""dark narrow glens"" with sloping trees being described in the voice-over.And what a shame that Stanley made the setting modern, and couldn't resist inserting a black hero (HPL is spinning in his grave!), and chose to make the family at the center of the tale middle-class, educated, and hip.

I also loved the style of the film so I was looking forward to enjoy this for a while. Richard Stanley's comeback, with Color Out of Space.Where do I begin, Well first of all, HP Lovecraft is cosmic horror royalty. We know that. but Richard Stanley is back, the 80's called, and have a left over relic undiscovered until now with a love letter to HP Lovecraft, and where that page left off on was a fascinating trip to pick things back up on. From here on this page. The cosmic nature has no mercy. This is more eccentric art horror than it is drama. Of course it has it's cheesy bits, some that could have been less rough around the edges, but it cuts it's own path. The cgi is a little heavy-handed in some parts, mainly the filters that borderline on cartoony at times. But the aesthetic and bright pink and purple is easily forgiven as a call back to Lovecraftian neon horror like ""From Beyond"" (1986).But the execution here is something to appreciate. Not with out flaws of course. But it is there to have fun and ponder the perils of Lovecraft through Richard Stanley's vision, the Lovecraft adaptations are getting more distinct with this entry in the Lovecraft cinematic universe that has evolved.The MUSIC score is an incredible part of the experience and worth mentioning and deserves praise for stealing the power of some of the ambiance and making it all *work*.Lovecraft, the writer who barely made money while he was actually alive conjuring up these wonderful cosmic horror stories; To see how his art has impacted the world and not to mention translated and kickstarted a whole genre -that is something so much more... Is the stunning truth of the nature here.Damn. This is not a perfect movie to watch over and over, but it does Lovecraft a bit of due time! I read the short story before watching, and yes, it is quite faithful but also takes it's own liberties for sure and can borderline on forgivable cheese.Howard Phillips Lovecraft brought me here, and I was not too disappointed.

179,redtiago,everything invaded,8,2 March 2021,"I was already giving this weekend a lost in terms of cinema after a couple of average movies, when in good time I decided to see this film, a homonymous adaptation of a short story by a writer who I admire H.P Lovecraft.
In good time I did it because it is very good with a very original and lovecraftian aesthetic. Even one-dimensional Nicolas Cage, always with the same silly face in all the films, does very well in a silly role that fits him like a glove.
And for us Portuguese it has an extra attraction, it was co-produced in Portugal and shot mostly in Sintra, in the film a forest on the outskirts of Arkham, but not only. Those who know will recognize the beautiful landscape of Lagoa Azul and at the end of ye movie the Castelo de Bode dam, the house of the farm is located in São Pedro de Penaferrim (Sintra).In relation to the movie itself, it is a horror thriller in increasing tension with an atmosphere that grows in a very effective aesthetic choice in purple tones that involves everything. Very good.
The only thing I would have added if I had directed it was to put on the teenager's headphones and in the final credits the song, also certainly inspired by the Lovecraft universe ""everything invaded"" by Moonspell.

Of course you get the preposterous character of a mayor who doesn't care about the poisoned water she's going to drink herself just because she has already signed some contracts. One of the odd decisions is a teenager who climbs down into a stone well to save a dog that he already knows has turned into stinky color-soup just before he is himself devastated by a blast of color-virus. I don't know any of Lovercraft's work and judging by the many failed Stephen King's adaptations, I'm more than ready to believe that this movie fails Lovecraft too.

Been trying to find a movie with real disturbing creatures since watching Thing and The Void. Something along the lines of DeadSpace creatures. This just didn't do it for me.The flow of the story didn't capture me either. It was over-shadowed by bad acting. Or acting that didn't make sense or go along with the scene/mood. It was almost like they were playing people who were acting, if that makes sense. Nicholas Cage's acting just wasn't good and way too over dramatic to looney.

The average 6.2 IMDB rating is a travesty--COoS is worth, at a minimum, an average of 7.5-8 stars. What the 'Mandy' team pulled off with this HPL adaptation is phenomenal, and the production values are a top-notch effort at bringing the lyrical terror of the HPL story to life.Nicolas Cage's acting is a bipolar rollercoaster and probably COoS's biggest flaw in an otherwise consistently mesmerizing movie. The first and third(final) acts of the film are where Cage's acting is strongest. The intermediate act before Cage and his family fully devolve into madness is definitely Cage's weakest part of the whole film. He has this bizarre east coast accent that almost sounds feminine (probably as a way to mock Lavinia?) and it just sounds cringeworthy and unbelievable. Apart from Cage, I felt that the supporting actors did a great job at their consistency and presented a rather believable spiral into madness.The movie is somewhat ambiguous in its explanation for what actually happens, so I'll give you my interpretation of what happens: The rock is the fragment of a star that has gone supernova somewhere in the galaxy, and it lands in their backyard before it goes full quasar. The massive energy from this star fragment is responsible for the radiation contaminating everything, and since we've never actually been able to experiment what the effects of such an energy source would have on human beings due to the impossibility of orchestrating such an experiment, the scriptwriters were given a huge amount of creative licensing to create their own possible scenarios. In the case of COoS, it's an atomic quantum nightmare from the cosmos.The film itself is somewhat of a slowburn, but the payoff is stunning. The last 20ish or so minutes of the film are searing, and the Alpacas and Lavinia's Mother will probably prove to be two indelible elements from this film that you'll never forget.Worth watching.

Any adaptation of a story by HP Lovecraft is prime material for horror and this one takes the cake. While Stephen King gets all the attention, Lovecraft practically invented horror, and he now needs as many adaptations as he can get. There would be no King without Lovecraft. Nicolas Cage chews the scenery in the best possible way; either he's a maniac or the best method actor possible, we'll never know, but it's brilliant. The rest of the cast perfectly exemplify anxiety, tension and give us the creeps for two straight hours. It oozes creepiness from top to bottom, start to finish, with the most cringe-inducing sights and sounds I've heard in a horror movie. It's the perfect horrific atmosphere and compelling descent into madness. If The Thing had a baby with Annihilation, this would be it, in all it's deformed glory. Richard Stanley seemingly appeared out of nowhere, after a long absence apparently, and brings us this gem. If that's not a great comeback, I don't know what is. He says he's planning to make a trilogy of Lovecraft films, and I just bought my ticket years in advance to see them. Richard Stanley, after directing the infamous Island of Dr. Moreau, then landing in some filmmaking purgatory, shows everyone how it's done, giving us the gold standard for recent horror movies. This film pretty much feels like a big slap in the face to all the stupid ones coming out. Everyone, take notice from Stanley, he's back on top in my book.

Overall mood is ominous and creepy throughout, from the first frame of trees in a forest to the final shots of waterways, reservoirs and dams. But what elevates this movie to another level is surely Nicholas Cage, in prime bug eyed crazy mode - it pushes the already bizarre goings-on into a truly surreal nightmare. Nic Cage, bless his soul, although he is not one for being selective of his roles (resulting in many recent somnambulant turns for an easy paycheck) but every now and then you get Nic Cage in full bug out mode, and it really puts the icing on an already very slick and polished sci-fi horror film.

Richard Stanley doesn't throw the horror in our faces, but slowly builds tension as things get really weird, while still keeping the movie grounded by the family it involves. The acting is fine, and while Cage goes full Vampire's Kiss towards the end, his mannerisms fits perfectly to the Lovecraftian madness that ensues. I enjoyed the movie very much.

I read the book prior and must note, they really added some nice twists to the source material. The acting was top-notch. The special make-up monster design was absolutely old-school and practical, but what I loved even more was Richard Stanley didn't exploit gore, neither overused the jumpscares here - just enough to convey the story - and the CGI was unbelievably well done, considering the budget.

But that's not saying a lot. Because, there really have been so few. I just don't know if it's possible for any screenwriter or director to successfully bottle one of his narratives into the confines of a movie. But some have come close, and this is one of those.Lovecraft's cosmic horror doesn't follow the simple path of problem, struggle, solution, resolution. In the Lovecraftian universe there are no happy endings. He plays with themes and ideas that man has no hope of overcoming, understanding, or solving . That makes him somewhat unique among western authors.The production value of this movie was pretty good. But in my opinion some of the acting was a little over the top. Most notably Nicholas Cage's character. I don't know if that was Cage's fault or the director's, but his character was just the most ""off"" of all the cast. The entire family that was at the center of this movie were mismatched and odd even before the odd things began to happen. I think it would have been more powerful had the screenwriter or director chosen to make them more mainstream in the beginning and let the events of the movie change them into what we see in the second and third act. Cage's character seemed to have a couple of bolts loose from the very beginning. ...maybe that's the way they wanted him to be played, but to me the performance felt overplayed and a bit awkward. .If you are looking for a movie that is going to tie everything up in one neat package, don't watch this one, because you will be disappointed. That's simply not the way Lovecraftian stories work. If you like Lovecraftian cosmic horror then go for it, this one won't disappoint you, beside some of the character performances I think it does a fair job adapting the major themes from the original story.",Color Out of Space

Cage is his usual self, very believable despite his frequent overacting, as well as all the others excellent cast members . Some CGI could have been better, some humor felt a bit out of place but overall it was an excellent effort and surely Richard Stanley's best movie to date.

I admit that Cage might not have been the best choice in this movie and his acting is mediocre at best (his humor is very dry these days), but the children acted superbly.The CGI and special effects are ok, maybe not the best but still very immersive with the story. Aside from the kids and Ezra, the other cast is kind of hit and miss, but they are not present in the movie for too long so I can give that a pass.There is effort put in how this movie was directed, visualized and even the sound made scenes very unsettling. Some scenes could have used more work, but I love the fact that the story takes its time to invest you in the characters. Even the Alpacas were a sweet touch.Since this is a Lovecraft movie, we all know that there is no happy ending here and that the creature just exists without even realizing humans are around it. It has no intentions or good or evil and that is what makes Cosmic Horror so wonderful, the fact that we can't do anything to save ourselves in the face of such unfathomable events.

Lovecraft classic and I think he would be pleased.,10,3 May 2020,"The initial beginning of this film found me feeling somewhat lack luster, however the film eventually blooms into an amazing interpretation of the Lovecraft classic.Without a doubt this was a great vision of the famous Lovecraft statement:
""The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.""As a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's work, I was often spell bound by how much creepier and frightening his works were to most modern day author's(even Stephen King admits to being spell bound by Lovecraft.), the concept of horror's beyond imagining where often hinted to and described to the best of the author's ability but what really scared the hell out of my was how he managed to encourage or even force the reader into imagining what the unknown may be like and further more how much you really may not want to know what it is.There was an uncertainty and almost scary realism to his writings. While they were works of fiction, they felt as if possibility was lurking just beyond a veil that we the readers could not see or feel, but of which was there waiting to come forwards and bring with it untold horrors beyond imagining.This film really brought that forward and I found myself spell bound by the horror that resulted mainly from the pure ignorance of the people who refused to believe it was happening until the moment it was to late.The fate of the daughter character was particularly freaky as it's not sure if she actually wanted or perhaps started the incursion into a dimension we as human beings were without doubt not supposed to see or even know of.Seriously superb adaptation of a Lovecraft classic that's got me wanting to read the original story pronto.Amazing performances by all actors. What's got me most thrilled about this movie is that it's one I'm going to want to watch again and again as there's bits and pieces to be enjoyed over and over again, if not the whole film for it's scary view into a dimension no human being should ever mess with.If your a Lovecraft fan, your going to love this, if your new to Lovecraft but love horror films, there's bound to be some goodness to be found here. I started off not being overly thrilled but by the end I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and will be watching this one again.Any movie that makes you want to watch it more than once is already 5 out of 10 stars there, but coupled with spell binding special effects and attention to the freaky details, I can't fault it for what it is.Enjoy.",Color Out of Space

Cage & Richardson were the most annoying idiotic parents ever. It's like he was continuing his dad role from Mom & Dad--actually a better movie. Maybe he & the director were really high during this mess, & Metacritic must've been on the same mushrooms to give a score of 70! Elliot Knight & Josh C.

In fact all the adults in the film are decent enough actors.

At many points in the film, the characters behave excruciatingly irrational, even before the effects of ""The Color"" take shape. I found myself praying for the quick and swift demise of the characters... Not out of spite, but rather mercy for themselves. It felt like watching someone navigate a room full of upward-facing thumbtacks while blindfolded, except also oblivious to both the blindfold and whatever obvious mysterious danger lies around them...In general, the film just feels confused about itself...

247,sstetsko,"Just a bit to add to all the others that will review, and have reviewed this.",8,22 May 2020,"Like him or not, Lovecraft has been one of the greatest contributors to horror of all time. Even the great Stephen King has borrored generously from his work, and many movies have been spawned from his legacy. By far the most have been more indirect references, while only a few have been direct adaptations. While many of them (as is par for the course in all genres, but in horror in particular) were not at all that good, many of them were very well done and have inspired, scared, and delighted moviegoers for decades to varying degrees. Movies like Midnight Meat Train, The Void, In the Mouth Of Madness, Reanimator, It, and even Hellboy owe a great deal, if not all, their inspiration to Lovecraft's work.For all this amassed body of work, few movie makers ever try to stay very close to the actual Lovecraft work, and there are arguably some good reasons to do so. To depict madness inducing multidimensional realities, largely atmospheric details based far more on feelings and descriptions than on actual monsters and events... to try to capture in image form DREAD which is far better imagined than shown, is a task that is daunting at the very least.I must say though, while definitely not strictly adhering to the original text in making a modern version of The Color Out of Space, this version is one of the truest adaptations of any Lovecraft tale I have yet to see, and easily one of the best. It has enough flash and modern context to bring new viewers to the Lovecraftian ethos, while still keeping the core atmosphere and subject matter of the story alive. It is delightful to see such a reverent interpretation of a story that I, in absolute truth, cut my teeth on at the beginning of my lifelong enjoyment of horror. it is also great to hear the director, Richard Stanley, is planning on tackling more Lovecraft tales soon.This story in particular was a memorable one for me as a kid... and I am glad to see it given its due. Only one other adaptation is better in my opinion... and if you liked this version and would chance to see an even more direct (albeit also a slightly more artistically abstract) version, I would HIGHLY recommend you see Die Farbe (aka The Color), which is a German version from 2010.Happy viewing.(PS, I know of an Italian version as well that i have yet to see.

The visuals were really good, the acting was decent (Nick Cage reminded me of a poor man's Jack Nicholson. Maybe it was the plaid shirt), the sound design and music were good, too, but the dialogue and overall narrative kind of fell apart when the mother and son are affected by the color. There was some good, practical special effects but they did not really add much to the film for me. The major set piece, where Cage shoots the Alpaca monster played as a crappy allusion to The Thing (1981), but an R. J. MacReady, Nick Cage is not.
My main complaint, as is often the case, was the lack of narrative direction, sensical character decisions, and an overall ""point"" to the story. It really feels that the starting point, and end point of the film, should have been different versions of the Lovecraft story.
It's no Mangler 2, but a true genre masterpiece, this film is not.

252,sebastianschlicht,Uninspired and frustrating horror trash ...,3,18 May 2020,"The horror sci-fi film ""The Color Out of Space"" from 2020 is one of many film adaptations of the H. P. Lovecraft short story. Director Richard Stanley is a big fan of Lovecraft and wanted to show a worthy implementation of the material. Since I am not a Lovecraft reader, I cannot judge very much in this regard. But what I can judge is the result and how much it entertained me ...
The story is quite simple: The Gardner family moves from the big city to the country. Life could be perfect if it weren't for a meteorite that crashes into the Gardners front yard one night and from then on changes the life of the family fundamentally ...
Admittedly, the film starts off promisingly, the atmosphere has something sinister about it, and Steve Annis' camera work is also very solid. Colin Stetson's synth-inspired score adapts well to the action, but it doesn't take long for the film to evolve into the cheapest trash. I am aware that director Stanley wants to celebrate and quote typical horror films and their tropes from the 80s, but in my eyes he unfortunately fails completely. Every shocker ended with a hearty laugh from myself. Unfortunately, I would not call ""The Color Out of Space"" a film that is so bad that it´s good... No, it's rather so bad that you laugh at it and immediately forget it. Sometimes it really frustrated me. Why?On the one hand, the script is really weak: the characters are badly and one-dimensionally written and explain every crap to the ""stupid audience"". ""Oh honey, isn't it nice that we can live on my father's ranch and escape the city?"" ... Dialogues like this have nothing charming or real but is just cheap and forced exposition. In my opinion, almost all actors are unable to authentically sell this crap. Nicolas Cage has his fun, but at the end of the day he is simply Nic Cage himself. The scene with the tomatoes and peaches is very funny, apart from that, unfortunately, only Cages ""over-acting"" comes through. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. In my eyes, everyone is not particularly good, especially the three kids are sucking a lot of potential out of the admittedly good basic idea. For example, I hate it when someone who is close to a character dies and in the next scene the same person acts as if that death never happened. A prime example of unimaginative writing.Furthermore, there are many plot lines that are going nowhere. This can work in a more realistic horror flick, but here it looks like they just wanted to get to the ""creepy"" and bloody scenes.Finally, the effects: Of course, a movie with a budget of just $ 12 million must make certain restrictions here and there, but there are so many films that have achieved great things with their small budgets. A great example of this is ""The Void"", also a horror-movie (which even has a lot of the Lovecraft style). ""The Color Out of Space"" unfortunately looks very cheap. The camera work is pretty solid but the CGI-effects, which the film unfortunately uses far too often, look laughable. There is just no horror for me. Playing with the extraterrestrial color is also quite nice, but in my opinion not used very creatively.Conclusion: ""The Color Out of Space"" is a big disappointment for me. Nicolas Cage had won me back with ""Mandy"", but here he shows that he also needs a talented director. The cast is weak, the script sucks and the effects are laughable.

The dynamic gets faster and faster the further the story progresses. One of its weakest features for me was the development of the characters or the lack of it. I cant imagine someone being really invested into the struggles of the Gardner family. What keeps us interested is the hope of learning more about the mysterious light and why does it work the way it does.

It was well done, for what it was, but the impression I got from reading about Lovecraft's story was that it was more subtle, more abstract, maybe more philosophical. That tweaked my imagination, as to how such a story could be made a little more obscure, yet interesting enough to hold a viewer's attention by inspiring his or her imagination. 2001: A Space Odyssey gave me that kind of fascinating experience.

The film is stunningly gorgeous, filled to the brim with vivid colors and gorgeous cinematography as every shot seemed to dazzle with care and consideration, a dazzle only matched by equally unnerving sci-fi concepts presented in a beautifully written script by Scarlett Amaris based on the wonderful original short story.

I'd like to read the story and see if it will maybe connect some things better. For what it is as a movie, I think Color Out of Space has some very neat, also unsettling things during in it's run. Just the visuals alone were worth the watch for me, but as a whole, it was sort of a head-scratcher. Just my opinion of course.

306,iremvidewb,Looking forward to more,9,12 April 2020,"Many horror films focus on scaring the characters to the point of either hysteria or resolve, but this fear is less interesting to the viewer because it is flat. Maybe the source of fright is tailored to a psychological event in that particular character's past, essentially pressing the wound. If the good outcome where they overcome their fear is 'green,' and the bad outcome where they succumb to it is 'red,' Colour out of Space ends up as 'orange with purple polka dots.' This is because, although certain elements of the family are distorted through the colour (e.g. the melded statue in the living room possibly influencing the fate of the alpacas, or more obviously Nathan channelling his father's mannerisms), the source of their torment is foreign and probably uncaring as to whether it scares them or not. This allows for a broader range of reactions than the typical screaming and running since the family interacts with the colour like it is a character itself. Sometimes it is curiously beautiful and benign enough not to bother questioning too deeply: the new flowers near the well. During the lightning storm it is like a dream that is forgotten for its singular peculiarity the next day. And when it really starts to mess with the family in life-threatening ways, it doesn't seem like it wants to do this-it is only being itself-but the family's difficulty lies in how they can deal with this new reality, not only psychologically but as humans.Certain scenes standout for their delivery: the immediately engrossing introduction, the reveal of Theresa and Jack's condition, the final visit to Ezra's shack, and the last scene with the dam. It seems like there was fun and creativity from the filmmakers in getting these just right. The soundtrack was also on point, crucial in telling the story, and can be suggested as night-time listening in a dark room.On the first viewing I thought this film had interesting ideas and was reasonably well made, with Cage's acting being the weak point (seven out of ten). I viewed it a second time and saw some more details in the first act and realised there was not much that was unnecessary. I remembered that Nathan went into the accent not because it was poorly done sarcasm but because it was his father's ""condescendingly intellectual"" accent. I also got over the idea of just waiting to see Nic Cage freak out-he actually plays his character well i.e. Nathan freaks out. Colour out of Space continues to stay on my mind and the final rating is nine out of ten.",Color Out of Space
307,wire_,Color Out of Space (2019),1,7 October 2019,"Color Out of Space (2019)Saw this with Richard Stanley in attendance at PDX Hollywood Theater and H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.I went in cold, not knowing much about Lovecraft, and knowing nothing at all about the story. I had heard that Stanley was of some renown for getting sacked from production of Island of Dr. Moreau, with Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer and others, and that he invoked voodoo upon the production out of mischief.
If you read the wikipedia entry, Lovecraft's story itself sounds pretty good.Too bad the movie scrambles it up into a tedious admixture of contemporary fear of mixed ethnic mating, cheezball humor, and Cage's now-overworked histrionic raving.It appears Stanley has compressed Lovecraft's epochal tale into a slice-of-life couple of days in the lives of some non-descript city folk turned sheep farmers. Lovecraft's rural homestead is cast as a pastoral bourgeoise retreat with a fine wine cellar, color tv and poor internet service, which is ruining Cage's wife's work as an finance / investment analyst. Her complaints about the internet gets dropped so many times in the script you expect Wall St's bull to appear as a monster, but it's ultimately an inconsequential detail.The tale is pegged to the emotional straights of a pretty goth-occult (Wiccan? Someone behind me in theater grunted nerdly recognition and approval at some distinctive category of her magick that fandom sees as determinant, but like the mom's profession is another inconsequential plot detail) white teenage girl who-while inexplicably casting spells near a lake on her family's property-encounters a handsome black ""hydrologist"" (surveyor). This is also inconsequential to the plot. Why is this man there? In Lovecraft's story he's an observer who helps the reader make sense of the odd effects that occur upon the landscape as a result of the ""meteor"" impact.In this adaptation, could this man be imbued with a wizardly understanding of the sexual contours of nubile girls? If only... Because as you will see, the entire movie is built around her purely passive, innocent sexual attraction to him somehow splitting the world asunder, rendering the homestead, and destroying them all. That's pretty much it. IOW the contents of the story is nothing more than the slightest potential of a mixed ethnic young love affair destroying the world. The meteor is just a supernatural mcguffin.Meanwhile a bunch of silly stuff occurs. Sadly for the viewer nothing else really happens.The psychic dimensions of the meteor intrusion go totally unexplored, with the events of the plot, alternately disjointed and spuriously interconnected by weak dialog serving no purpose other than to get from one scene to the next, which in the long run serves no point at all.It's a remarkable visual experience, I suppose. But it feels designed for the psychic aptitudes of 12-going-on-40 year olds Cthuhlu nerds-who btw must have very sophisticated visual pattern matching capacities because all manner of intense camerawork and vfx are deployed to try to hold audience interest in a plot that's going down a dark road at the 45-mph maximum speed of Cage's 80s vintage Volvo station wagon.In place of drama, exploration and suspense, you'll see psychedelic vfx ala Annihilation, body horror ala Mandy and a procession of jump scares bookended by old Nick Cage's pro forma crazy-ase hamming.A solid hour of churning monster mayhem and a iridescent light show leave the hydrologist as the last man standing. He looks across a blighted ruin of a landscape turned to ashes by a teenage girl's amorous histrionics, and wonders aloud about the effects of color on the world. I am not making this up.I doubt the director is a bigot, but watching this movie in a sea of Portland Cthulhu hipsters and considering Lovecraft's misanthropy and deep strain of white supremacy / xenophobia, I noticed how much these monsters are simply sprouts of unexamined libido rooted in the acrid soil of America's origins with the rapacious empires of Europe, Puritanical new world flight, the North American genocide, and the lingering scars of the Civil War. Portland is a very white and rejunevile city, and this ""culture"" is fit for an episode of Portlandia. Never mind that the movie was made in Portugal.At Q/A after show, Stanley said if you kill a dog you've got a B movie. Well you can get B movie many other ways and dropping Tommy Chong's weed-addled old visage into the mix for no reason is another.Yet the audience seemed to love it and gave a standing ovation. Maybe more out of appreciation for Stanley's appearance at the festival than because they loved the movie?And it's not a good movie. There's some memorable imagery, and some cinematic craft in keeping with this technical age of the movies, but nothing to go on about. The whole effort felt forced.Nobody at the Q/A gave a flying F about the medium as an avenue of cultural exploration re Lovecraft's latent racial politics.I find the mysterianism of the Necronomicon and the rest of this sort of pop occultism tedious, notwithstanding its purely anthropological features.To his credit, Stanley remarked that his teleplay was informed by his great personal fondness for Lovecraft's work and his awareness of ""Lovecraft's misanthropy and racism."" That comment spared him from a pointed question I wanted to ask about the absurdly trivial ""racial"" dimension of the plot re mixed ethic love.The festival presentation met the basic parameters of fun but was a typical PDX circle of banal hipster fetish and minor celebrity with the movie less a main feature of the event and more a prop for the fetish.Stanley seems an intelligent and interesting guy and he's worth looking into, esp per the documentary on his de-railed adaptation of the Island of Dr. Moreau and some documentaries which will be difficult if not impossible to find.I hope he keeps making movies so that he can someday redeem the promise hinted at by this competent if not compelling production.",Color Out of Space

No, it does not; it is a science-fiction story. Many of Lovecraft's stories do not involve the Cthulhu Mythos.I would have enjoyed this film more if I had not read the story many years ago.The only things this movie shares with Lovecraft's ""The Colour Out of Space"" (yes, it is spelled the English way) are a few lines of narration and the broad outline of a meteor crashing into a farm resulting in the gradual degradation of the inhabitants and the nature around them. There are a few plot details that are kept, such as some huge, inedible fruit, but that is about it.I was intrigued by the similarities to a haunted house movie like ""The Shining"" or ""The Amityville Horror"": the invisible friend of the youngest child, the static on the phone, the descent into madness of the father, the delicate subject that affects one of the characters (breast cancer), the father who still haunts Cage's thoughts, the characters not being allowed to leave (according to the daughter), and even The Necronomicon.While Cage does overact, the children are sympathetic. Unfortunately, though, the characters do some stupid, only-in-a-horror-film things. After everything that has happened and all that you have seen (including horrific, mutated animals), you hear your missing dog's bark coming from the bottom of a strangely-lit well and you climb in to rescue it?Between the overacting and the foolish decisions of some characters, I wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy.",Color Out of Space

I generally like horror movies though I don't actually watch or enjoy watching them as often anymore. Horror grounded in reality gets arduous quick but as far as supernatural thriller-type movies this one's a winner. It does something different without coming off low budget or unrelatable.Sure, there's some flaws but once the color arrives all the characters thought processes are suspect. So when a character pauses in mid-escape to attempt a near-hopeless rescue from about the most likely place to get killed on the property, you have to just go with it. If there's a purple hostile alien presence and you've got a way you escape you just go,There's humor too. Some obvious, some not so much. Clearly funny:
Dad, ""I'll handle it.""
Daughter, ""Like you 'handled' the alpacas!!""
The whole alpaca angle makes for some good chuckles.Other stuff maybe you'd need to relate. Seeing a teenager bust out the Necronomicon you just know someone's talking themselves too seriously. Then trying to use it for ""help"" is just hilarious. It's been awhile but I'm pretty sure it's no self-help book. But that whole aspect just gets kinda dropped. Maybe it was to indicate that the evil purple thing is so alien that even Kthulu and Shub Niggurath were a loss? Haha, I don't know but the movie stays pretty busy so there's not a lot of time to dwell on it.The gist of the story, as I understand it, is a meteorite crashes, bringing with it a most likely malevolent entity that's not really definable by our senses. A color not in our spectrum. This is a concept visual artists may have pondered already. How can we know all the colors? There's really only a half dozen? It's a tricky concept to convey in writing much less a visual medium. It's something different. You could even argue it's not trying to rob anyone's day. Maybe it's version of taking a nap happens to also Earth goats melt? Gives you things to think about. Answering everything would defy what they're trying to show you.Nicholas Cage gets weird but less so than other movies and everyone is adversely effected anyway. In my opinion he could've hammed it up way more than he did. Tommy Chong was good but could've used a little more maybe.It's creepy, suspenseful, gets gross. The soundtrack does a great job.

This is probably the first serious attempt with a large production, but sadly it fails again.The plot is good, the special effects are good, the characters are good. Nevertheless the director fails in proving suspence and horror. The feeble thrill is broken by a diffused underlying comedy that won't let grow any tension in you.It's a pity, since the movie could have been a blend of both The Shining and The Thing. Sadly, the ""Shining"" part is ruined by a Nicolas Cage who's really far from Jack Nicholson and closer to Adam Sandler. The ""Thing"" part is just barely used.I'm giving it a 6 because it's decent, but at the same time I'd give it a 4 because of the wasted chance. They were so close... :'(",Color Out of Space

329,gothicdoometal,Lovecraft dies twice!,2,28 January 2020,"First of all it is absolutely essential to establish initially that this movie is in no way a lovecraftian movie but rather advertised as one.People who expect something remotely reminiscent of Lovecraft will be absolutely disappointed by this movie.I was excited to hear about it's announcement and shocked to see who was the protagonist.I could hardly imagine an actor more unsuitable for the role than Cage.Of course anyone who's ever read Lovecraft could tell you the same which in turn shows that the director has absolutely no clue about his subject.That was the first clue of what was about to come.Still the colour out of space is one of my favourites novels and i tried to keep an open mind.Let's start by the positives.The movie is visually perfect. The special effects are stunning and the scenes depicting the colour are flawless.Unfortunately this is where the positives stop.The movie fails in every other aspect to be not just a decent lovecraftian movie but also just a decent horror movie.The plot is slow which is not necessarily a bad thing but the action is stagnant.It has no climax.You don't feel like the horror and anxiety are actually escalating partly because the main protagonist fails horribly to deliver a performance that reminds us of all the terror and uncertainty a lovecraftian character feels and partly because the plot doesn't help.
You see the thing about the plot is that there's hardly a plot.A very small part of the movie actually has to do with the plot which is very sloppy since no effort was put on it.Instead what you'll mostly see is the desperate attempts of the protagonist to fit in the shoes of a lovecraftian character trying to emulate a feeling of terror which he has never been able to accomplish in his entire career as an actor and some flashy special effects which in the director's mind are more crucial than building a plot .But although the plot is hardly relevant to Lovecraft's work the worst by far is that the movie fails spectacularly in the most crucial part of actually being a lovecraftian movie.At no point in the point it makes you feel the terror and escalating madness that Lovecraft's works are notorious for and Cage's attempts are hilariously inadequate to mimic the feeling of helplessness that Lovecraft's protagonists have in his works.The absolute terror that they feel when confronted with something that is not only greater than them but also incomprehensible to them and the dive into madness they take when they realise how small and irrelevant they are in the face of Lovecraft's eldritch abominations.To sum up this movie failed because of a director who completely neglected or made an effort at all to understand his subject and because of his bad choices regarding actors as well as his inability to present a plot that was already written perfectly for him.Somehow Lovecraft's written work seems more alive and impactful on generating feelings than a high budget movie made in 2019.There are plenty of movies made regarding Lovecraft that although they were made 30+ years back are actually closer and depict successfully his dark and twisted world managing to enter deeper into the writer's mind that this movie would ever hope to do.Movies like from beyond and Re-animator which although old would eat movies like this for breakfast with their majestic plot progression and flawless and meticulous look into the very essence of Lovecraft's work.We can only hope that the director of this movie won't attempt to murder Lovecraft again for the third time!",Color Out of Space

Right from the beginning we are treated to nothing more than mediocre acting, uninspired writing, and a waste of time of a 1st act when we should instead be getting acquainted with all the characters so we can care about them. But none of the characters are likeable, or intelligent. It's as if the characters were all written by a primary school student. The characters are so silly and have almost comedically over the top traits such as the dumb stoner gamer and the magic ritual girl who carves symbols into her body for no reason, other than dragging out screen time. Everyone fails to make any good choices and noone seems the least bit surprised when the weird stuff starts happening like when the whole yard turns into pink fairyland. The father doesn't seem the least bit fazed when his son and wife are zapped into a gruesome amalgamation in agony and dying, however when he decides to kill his mutated alpacas, that is the one and only time he actually expresses sadness. Ridiculous characters that have no sense or consistency. Cage's acting in almost every scene fails to convey appropriate emotion. Only towards the end when he is suppose to be truly crazy does his acting work. The amount of disbelief you are forced into takes away any ounce of potential horror. The one shoehorned jumpscare is cheap, pointless and annoying. You as an audience couldn't care less if any or all of the characters die. This movie must take place in an alternate dimension where everyone has an iq of 50 and the emotional intelligence of a half-brained ant. The movie is so insultingly stupid and impossible to take seriously that the only horror in the movie is how boring it is. The only emtion I felt was boredom and regret for watching. At least the special effects were sometimes really cool, so +1 stars for that.

Acting is ok, Cage is relatively steady until understandably becomes his usual unhinged movie persona, but you kind of expect that. The rest of the cast serve the quite slim plot well.

351,nigel_essex,Such divided opinion,8,4 November 2020,"How to film a new colour? A intangible property that cannot be described. Richard Stanley has gone a long way in achieving just that in Color Out of Space. The HP Lovecraft short story is a marvel of conveying the descent into madness caused by the inescapable decay inflicted on a family by an alien entity. First the trees and plants, then the livestock and finally the people succumb to the colour. This film captures the essence of that story perfectly.
As adaptations go this is as faithful as we can expect. Remember this is cinema, not literature and so a visual license is allowed. The llama-thing in the barn, the fused bodies in the attic, the perversion of nature; all valid Lovecraftian images thrown into the pot. The kaleidoscope of horrific images and indescribable colour set against the deep green of the forest ""where no axe has fallen"" make the progressive madness all the more pronounced.
And of course there's Nicholas Cage. You either like him or don't. I think he's great and his mad-as-a-box-of-frogs performance is perfect for such a situation. I loved Mandy (didn't know what was going on) but loved the craziness of it all. And this follow up taps into that crazy. After all how would one react to the indescribable cosmic horror of the colour?

I haven't read the short story, so I was basically fresh to this not really knowing what was going to happen.The visuals and presentation at first is great sci-fi horror dread, however mixed with some oddly campy special effects and dialog. It's almost too in-your-face and obvious at times though, and the pacing goes from creeping to shrieking to creeping, with some odd psychotic moments and overly-long scenes of people being sick or hearing an irritating whistle too often and inconsistently, making me wonder what kind of experience the director was intending to evoke. A lot of it feels like different horror tropes mixed together, with some odd comedic moments mixed in, mostly from Nic Cage's frenetic performance, which jilts the flow and makes the mood a moving target for me.A lot of the visuals and sounds and situations work for Lovecraft in horror, though I bet they worked much better on paper than they ultimately ended up being as a movie. I have to knock some of the visuals though, as many of the creatures look more like they're out of video game pre-rendered CGI scenes than visceral monsters, which can take me a bit out of the immersion of the scene.About the only thing grounding everything was Elliot Knight's performance, which of course is partly the intention of his character being there, so he at least was allowed by the director to play the part instead of being shambled around like the rest of the characters to evoke horror tropes or wildly inconsistent behavior or push the plot along when it's meandering.As much as I wanted to like it, it ultimately felt like a B-movie with A- effects, A+ music, and decent acting from everyone where they could. The directing and writing just seemed to miss some sort of grounding, and things seemed very top-of-the-head ultimately, maybe for gasps or laughs, I don't know, but it's really mixed bag for me.

Richard Stanley has proven that he's a visionary (Hardware, Dust Devil) and has made so few films it's nice to see him take on a passion project and translate Lovecraft as few have done before.
Color Out of Space is not perfect but it's few faults are easily overlooked in favor of some truly otherworldly cinema. I would have preferred a period piece versus this modernization and the presence of Nicolas Cage can be distracting at times but he's not entirely unwelcome. Depicting a color you cannot see or describe sounds impossible but Stanley's shifting palette and distortions convey Lovecraft's creation aptly and the combination practical/digital effects are quite admirable for a mid-budget affair.
This film may not appeal to those uninitiated (or unimpressed with) weird fiction. If you're a Cage-hater probably avoid as well.

381,camcullensmith,Tried hard but mixed bag,6,24 January 2021,"Geniune passion for the source material and genre went into this. However a few weird choices had the experience thrown off.Clunky exposition in the first 30 minutes made it feel like this was the first time the family members have met. No real relationship building, and honestly we arent guided to really care too much.Couple of super cheap jump scares instead of building up geniune suspense. I would have hoped for a more organic sense of dread over a super loud car alarm going off. A sequence follows; ""oh wheres the missing cat"", cuts to the father driving, then crazy loud screech and close up off the malformed cat in the middle of the road.Easy to pick up that time distortion is an element of the 'color'. However i did find some of the choices to demonstrate time were confused. E.g. Dad goes to get a bottle of wine from the Cellar at the start of dinner, then comes back up and tells the daughter to get a start on the dishes. That scene was before the meteor so just felt like the script needed tidying up.
Same for another scene, mother was in the middle of preparing dinner but cuts herself so father drives her to hospital but then the son is told its time for bed whilst they were waving off their parents. No dinner for that kid i guess!Sound mixing was a bit of a mess, especially at the start. I found myself fiddling with the volume a few times throughout the movie.Also, Nick Cage was really ticking a lot of boxes for me at the start but for the last 30 minutes of the movie he is just Nick Cage. This really bugged me, and even with the heavy situation going on his acting pulled me away from that.Everyone else was on the 'pretty decent' to 'strong' range of acting.Dispite this i would still say watch it if you are into Lovecraft or just this genre in general. I adore cosmic horror and it is an incredibly difficult topic to express on film, so really big props on visuals but for the most part lacked the dread style atmosphere. Went in hoping for 'The Witch' or 'Hereditary' level depth but ended up with more popcorn shock horror.",Color Out of Space
382,willismagilous,Great start but too much fluff,4,1 March 2020,"Firstly, Errza and Ward were completely unnecessary in the plot. Neither character deserved the amount of time spent on them. Ward being present during 'The Strange Days' didn't make any sense. He was notably far too young to be a hydrologist to be sent by the state to survey the land. If it were me deciding who to send, I'd logically pick someone older and more experienced than someone fresh from school. The water safety of an entire town is way to important for such a chance of amateurish error. Why was there a romance subplot between him and Levinia? It wasn't even used to force emotional strain during her death, or blatantly failed to do so if that was the intention. I'd like to specify why Ezzra is so needless, but there's really nothing to elaborate. He did literally nothing whatsoever. One conversation and we're supposed to care about him?There were far too many subplots that didn't do anything, and far too many emphasized details that served no purpose. Part of the the story's mysteriousness was that the general public watched the Gardner family fall into ruin, but the movie chose to focus more on Levenia being a cultist, and Nathan's wife (I forgot her name) being a successful businesswoman, which really didn't mean anything at all. I'm not even sure what her occupation was to be honest.Although I did like some reference to other H.P. Lovecraft's works, like the forecast announcer mentioning Dunwich was fun. But others were forced and actually felt wrong. The strongest example is Levenia just owning a paperback Necronomicon. Anyone who knows Lovecraft's Necronomicon know you don't just buy one at your local Barnes And Noble. Then Levenia does some uninspired ritual using the book to do what? Frankly, I don't know. It's sole purpose has always been to summon the Old Ones, not to curse someone with boils or the like. I just don't understand why it's included at all.The movie is also far too tunnel-visioned. As I've already mentioned, the outsiders view of the Garnders' downfall was half the mystery; not knowing just what is wrong, and what is the color doing to them. However, the movie solely focuses on the family themselves. They hardly even mentioned the farmland or the animals until the later 2nd act, but it's those details that made the color such a mysterious force. I wanted to know how others saw their descent to madness to make the very same insanity real. Until the bizarre fusion (which I did enjoy to an extant) between the young boy and his mother, the mental decay is only represented by a family yelling at one another, which isn't really abnormal for households under stress.Overall the movie felt rush but filled with too much fluff which certainly strained the movie's runtime. There were very specific moments I enjoyed; the aforementioned Dunwich referance in the weather forecast, and the light pouring from the well were well done, but I craved more concrete moments. For example, perhaps the family having waking and screaming nightmare in unison would've been nice, since it's said in the book that the Blasted Heath isn't a place for sound sleep. Maybe the family couldve displayed more abnormal moments. I liked how the Wife waved happily after slicing off her hand. Similar events could've solidified her mental decay. Frankly, being angry and stressed doesn't equal madness. Being calm and happy after you've severed half your fingers, that's freakishly insane.In conclusion, I felt the fluff replaced details and possible alternative subplots, and held this movie back from being a fantastic H.P. Lovecraft adaptation.",Color Out of Space

Kinda reminds me of the flak hurled at Conan: The Barbarian from REH purists, even though the film itself is fantastic. I'm talking about the Schwarzenegger classic, obviously, not the Momoa failed reboot.Even then, though, we don't talk about Conan: The Destroyer. Ever.Wow, this film is a Cronenberg/Carpenter-laced trip. And that means bad, BAD news for the characters. I dunno. As I get older, I become less tolerant of Godawful things happening to just random innocent people for no discernible reason. In times past, in media like TV shows and movies, bad things would tend to happen to actual bad people, or at least people who were morally tainted. Nowadays, though, everyone seems to be fair game, including little nerdy kids and moms already suffering with cancer.It's really ugly what happens to this family, particularly the mom and her youngest child. While all eventually fall prey to the meteorite from hell, what happens to the two of them is indescribably brutal and VERY hard to watch. This might've been less of a blow if the mother had been revealed to be abusing the kids or something, but she's just trying to telecommute and get through the days while dealing with an unnamed form of cancer. And the kid is just a kid who doesn't even squish ants for fun.The other family members are just as virtuous, if a bit squabbly. The worst thing that's revealed is that the older son smokes his share of pot supplied by Tommy Chong's squatter hippie character, but is that even a negative in this day and age? The Hellraiser Rock spares no one a painful and violent death, including the local animal population, except for a comically young hydrologist scientist taking water samples.And then there's Nicky Cage, hootin' and hollerin' as he's want to do. Compared to the others, he actually gets off with the equivalent of a wrist slap. Sure, he's consumed by the Lovecraftian light at the end, but his suffering is mostly mental, not physical (save for a rash), which gives him ample opportunity to go crazy in the way that only Cage can pull off. It's not Wicker Man levels of ridiculousness, but it's up there.The movie does take its sweet time before going completely bonkers, so it's not a rollercoaster from start to finish. However, that finish...wow. If that's what a bad LSD trip looks like, get it the hell away from me.I don't know much about HP Lovecraft other than what I've remembered through casual osmosis, so I can't comment about the film's fidelity to the original Colour story. However, I can say that those last 10 or 15 minutes should elicit a jarring response from just-about anyone.According to the stats on here, this film only cost a paltry $6 million. I can easily see that being recouped and then some, even when advertising is added to the final production tally. Richard Stanley surely must know he's onto something by pursuing Lovecraft's mad, mad genius, so I'm confident we'll either see a sequel (if that's possible) or an unrelated entry further exploring the unknowable cosmic horrors that occasionally brush against our fair Earth.A film NOT for the kids, nor for the faint of heart.",Color Out of Space

In the original story, everything that happen turns to ashes, the only good thing that can happen to a character of the story is if nothing happen. The Colors falls from the sky and protagonist gets a bit of notoriety than it turns to gossiping and abandonment. This is shown a tiny bit in the movie when we see the character of Nicholas Cage somewhat lost during his interview as well as his interaction with the officer at the end.Ignorance :
There is no one who is educated that bother to help them, no one knowledgeable to explain what is going own and to offer a possible solution. The character are completely on their own. On the other side, in the movie, the girl knows of witchcraft and owns a copy of the Necronomicon. She cast spells to help. There is also Chong who knows things, and share is knowledge in the end.Isolation :
The family being consumed by the Colors is on its own, in a remote farm. No one is there to help them, no one wants to go that far to help them. It is a trip to go there and the officers need to be guided there by the narrator. This is really hard to do in this day and age. That is why I consider the movie pulled it off rather well ! The isolation is shown by difficulty to travel from place to place, the Colors rendering this simple act dangerous by the mutated trees. There is also the issue with remote communication being affected.Powerlessness :
In the story, plants, insects and animals touched by the Colors turn lush with life and vigorous, than get consumed by it and die while in the movie, they mutated and acquire predatory traits and increased aggressiveness. It is as if the Colors as an agenda while in the book, it appears more to be a victim of circumstance as well. My understanding of what happened in the book is that the Colors fell on Earth and then consumed something from living things from its surrounding and left Earth when it was readied.Also, in the story, once the Colors touched us, we are aware that something bad is happening to us, that something is taken from us be we cannot do anything about it but remain in complete apathy, wait for our ineluctable demise. Even though the characters seems to stop being themselves in the movie, they are not powerless as they start fighting to achieve some sort of agenda by the Colors. We have a diametrically different energy from the characters, specially from Nicholas Cage.Indifference :
In the story, nothing indicate whether the Colors an intelligent life form or if they consider us intelligent. There is no attempt to establish communication with us nor if they have an agenda. They are just here and need to use something we have, something we need in order to return to space. In the end, the officers and narrator simply run off from it as it leaps from the ground to the trees and into the night sky.In the movie, the Colors communicate with the little kid, they lure the oldest brother, they share vision with the girl, they mutated all living things they come across. They acknowledge we exist and they seems to want to subdue us. In Cosmic Horror, Humanity's existence does not matter what we do or what we want. Those of us following entities are just deluding themselves. We are either not acknowledge, toys or tools to be used and discard. It is the polar opposite of Classic Greek Art where humans were the central measure of the Universe.Therefore, the themes are alienation from your community, ignorance and lack of understanding of your circumstance, isolation, powerlessness from what is happening, indifference from the Creature that simply needs to consume. Of all of those theme, only isolation is well carried (and it is no small feats !).All in all, it is an extremely difficult story to realize and maybe a theatrical released movie was not the proper medium. Should you manage your expectations, it will be a very enjoyable movie.Nicholas Cage's energy clash with some of the ambiance of the original story.

412,lenhardtstevens,Inconsistent Horror,5,2 February 2020,"I knew something was different about Richard Stanley's ""Color Out of Space"" from the opening scene. A young girl casts a spell to save her mother from cancer, and is interrupted by a traveling hydrologist who inquires about the property they find themselves on. Nothing about the dialogue feels right. Are they flirting, or are they uninterested? Are they relatable, or are they caricatures? Stanley walks the razors edge between self-aware camp and poorly executed story telling for the rest of the film. Nicholas Cage delivers another one of his riveting performances, and the film is replete with one liners that you will be reciting in the car all the way back home. But this is not a developed horror film, nor is it a movie whose drama invites the viewer to participate in otherwise heart-wrenching and surreal moments that the family must endure after the arrival of their colorful, space creatures. The reason for that, if Stanley had succeeded, would be that genre horror does not need to provide anything aside from visual thrills for its audience. I think there's something to that, and I would hope that can be reflected in this review. A film not rising to above an average quality does not make its value less than average. Stanley has a good grasp of how to dress his characters. A highlight for me was Tommy Chong's back woods character. Instead of being over the top, Stanley's affection for that personality came through Chong's limited screen time. I wonder what would happen if Stanley let someone else take the reigns on his characers' speaking.",Color Out of Space

I just loved it, plain and simple. It's strange, confusing, weird - and all this in a good way and in the right mixture. I found the acting great as well; although not a Nicolas Cage fan either, I thought he was amazing here.

414,richsonrichardson,Just a handkerchief shy of a cold meat platter,5,19 June 2021,"This momentumentally brave film redefines the brave film genre into something altogether more audacious. Perhaps most notably the film cannot be paused or ever fully heard. What makes this all the more challenging is the brave decision to keep the film entirely in the Tupperware dialect, unless of course you forked out for the Tupperware to gravy translation module, of which only three remain after the great gravy granulation event in Newcastle-under-Lyme.The film follows the exploits of astranout and all around pear man Nicholas Cage after he is colourblinded by a sausage meat surprise, though the specific type of sausage meat surprise bravely is never disclosed. The first half of the film languishes bravely in Nicholas's struggles with rehabilitation, before a stunning twist in which the moon men (as a nod to the chronicles) give Nicholas back his groovy colours. This is disrupted bravely by the actions of the antagonist seamstress teamster, Mrs Nesbitt. I can empathize with the frustrations of Mrs Nesbitt who tries postnatally to convince everyone that the toenail probability exponent is too low, but they just keep giggling and kissing their kidney trays.The film invites you into its world with a host of fully fleshed-out characters, such as the beautiful Pregnant Pals Clang and Spang and their relation to Mrs Nesbitt; the bowl of dandelion syrup which is bravely played by several tubes; Hannah; Mrs Nesbitt and the Nesbitt Housewives; the ordnance survey team; and who could forget the good old squalid muffled bean muffler, Mrs Nesbitt, and the rest. Taken together, their lives weave such an intricate web of intrigue and depraved splendour that even the most hardened of viewers will be left in full leakage.In summary: since the diagnosis, my wife has been trying to live life to the fullest, my children have started having children and not only in their nightmares, my parent has become an uncle to my only wetborn child, my grand-uncle once removed has finally started exploring his body before he succumbs to it, and I, Richson Richardson, have seen this film 15 times.

After all, contact with this terrible knowledge results in insanity or death.That said, I think Richard Stanley did a credible job in bringing this story to the screen. He stayed pretty close to the source material with the exception of an additional character. Set and setting were updated to a more modern time without damaging the integrity of the story.The visuals were well done giving an hallucinatory feel to the sense of dread and doom.Even the casting of Nick Cage was not fatal to the film as I had anticipated.

You really understand why the word Lovecraftian was invented. There's good way to describe it.The story:
It's just really gripping, tightly knit story. It feels really refreshing. In most movies today you have to ""turn off your brain and don't think about it"". It flows very naturally, it's paced well, it keeps the suspense where needed it builds characters well and does it seamlessly.The acting:
Nicolas Cage might be kind of a meme. He's starred in terrible movies, but in this one he works really well. The girl - Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), she was amazing. The actors really all did a great job.VFX:
You can obviously tell which scenes are VFX, because of the fantasy element. I really like the art direction though. It's job was to portray gross, unreal, supernatural things.

The CGI in this movie is excellent and in particular, the sequence near the end where the home world of the entity is shown for a short time - writhing masses, strange machinery, tendrils, gloom under a black sun, foreboding - absolutely epic and true to what HPL would have envisaged in his mired imagination.The soundtrack is also exceptional, as is most of the acting. And Tommy Chong is in it as a hermit philosopher stoner type with pounding psychedelic 1970's music emanating from his hut. Overall, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best adaptation of any of HPL's stories yet, by far, and I've seen them all - having been an aficionado of the mythos since my early life back in the 1960's. This director has done an amazing job of bringing this most difficult of concepts to the screen and I wait for more from him and his team.A final word. One of the reviewers gave this movie a poor score based partly on a perceived similarity with Annihilation. Well, the similarity is because Annihilation, just like the Blob and many others, was influenced by HPL's 1927 story and this movie is a faithful adaptation of that same story.

448,eapoe-43486,Crazy Wonderful,8,25 January 2020,"TLDR: The Color out of Space is a wild, heady, over-the-top, and terrifically satisfying movie. While flawed, it works almost as much because of its flaws as in spite of them.Adapting Lovecraft to film tends to require a certain amount of interpretive dance. His stories don't always have much dialogue and are often missing the descriptive beats that are now virtually an inviolable law in prose storytelling.That said, every Lovecraft fan has a good idea what should be present in a film adaption, even if he's not sure what needs to be added.Richard Stanley evidently has some very good ideas of what to add, and which actors might be qualified to carry it off.While sticking to the fundamentals and broad outlines of the original short story, he supplies his movie with gorgeous visuals and sounds, relatable characters, and enough crazy behavior to move his audience from the picture of an idyllic Alpaca ranch (yes, the main characters actually raise alpacas) to a hellish landscape of madness, deformity, and desolation.I've seen my share of Lovecraft adaptations. I'm thinking this one might be the best. Unlike the others, it doesn't forget what makes Lovecraft interesting, while still offering its audience (including the people who don't know Lovecraft from Lieber) an exciting and atmospheric experience.I saw Color on Wednesday the 22nd. While not a laugh-out-loud kind of guy myself, plenty of people there were, and showed it. It is, at times, a very funny movie. Until it's not. Then the theater got very quiet. There were reasons.So is Nicholas Cage as over-the-top in this movie as you'd expect him to be? Sure, more or less, at least some of the time. But I can't help feeling he found a very good place to do it.The Color out of Space is a wonderful movie--uneven, mesmerizing, surprising, beautiful, and a really great time. If you like horror (or Lovecraft or Cage or Stanley), you should definitely see it--now, while it's on the big screen, sounding and looking as large as a Lovecraftian horror should.",Color Out of Space

This one was like an old school X-Files type movie (you remember how bad some of those were right?)The acting in this movie was very low quality - kind of the way Christian Slater or Steven Seagal movies went. The story seemed like it could be okay - but all the intertwined stories didnt make sense - the Wiccan goddess by the river, the Scientist who looked and acted like a teenage boy, the hippy in the woods who didnt trust anyone (Its like Tommy Chong's contract is basically - ""will only play an off-his-tree stoner part"" no matter what the movie).Joely Richardson's part was also bizarre - some kind of FOREX broker who doesn't understand whether she is dealing in Dollars or Euros who complains about her intermittent phone connection - none of which helped the movie.
In fact the disparate parts almost felt like everyone was doing Improv.Near the end when the boy and Joely were mushed together by some kid of alien ray all the family cared about and talked to was the Joely mush - no-one tried to comfort the boy side of the mush even though his face was visible and could be talked to. If that was my boy I'd be more concerned with his well being than the moms.So yeah probably one of the worst movies I've seen since the last Transformers movie.

That's where I gave this movie its stars.To ANYONE saying this is a good Lovecraft movie; this movie has NOTHING in common with Lovecraft writing or style of writing and I highly recommend you pick up a book containing his stories and read this story before saying this is ""good"" Lovecraft. It's a very short story, but extremely rich in visual detail and rich in storytelling of a different kind. I have read almost ALL of Lovecrafts stories, most more than once as well. I have seen the b-horror movies. I have played video games with the ""style"" and have even taken part in the Cthulhu Role-playing game (pen & paper). I do not claim to be an expert, but I know enough of his style to know this movie does NOT fit the bill.They could not even reproduce the style of speech and writing Lovecraft was famous for... it's a real pity.This movie is pretty much an extremely watered-down modern re-interpretation of a very popular 'short' Lovecraft wrote. The problem with this movie, is the problem with so many modern movies and the way we watch movies or the type of content we ""westerners"" watch. It has to have action and overly-exaggerated sequences. The problem is the overly-exaggerated sequences and scenes are not the way Lovecraft write or expresses ""emotions"", reactions or actions.To make a Lovecraft story reproduced faithfully, a movie would have to come closer to the style of 2001: A Space Odyssey / Interstellar. In other words, a slow-paced movie with a more artful approach, rich in eerie visuals and mysterious characters. You need to FEEL a kind of encroaching doom over the period of the story. Details and the way Lovecraft expresses locations or characters is slow and descriptive. You have to have time to feel the heaviness of what he is trying to portray.Lovecraft stories are NOT about action and action sequences, nor monsters you can ""shoot"". Not only that, but why the HECK could they not make the movie in the same time period the story was taking place in? Wouldn't that have on it's own added a little more mystery and helped create the atmosphere Lovecraft is so famous for?And as a horror ""buff"", mainly supernatural and psychological horror, this movie doesn't even fit the bill. There was no tension, no ""mystery"" or dread. Every scene was cliché and taken from popular mass-produced tropes we have seen so many times. The ""twist"" in the movie, with the ""twisted and messed-up creatures just looked too much like they tried to gives us some ""The Thing"".Is that really the best the writers could come up with? Did they even read the story? or did they skim through the few pages at breakneck speed just to come up with a theme for their basic and over-done twist on a great writer?I guess I was just expecting something Lovecraftian.... instead, I got something very basic and riddled with popular mass-marketed ""horror"".Now, if you say you like Lovecraft, people will think of this failed attempt at a ""Lovecraftian"" movie.",Color Out of Space

It's very similar to the mythos of cthulu, a ''thing'' from ''somewhere'' that we cannot comprehend or overcome. It's not something you can beat or stop. Nothing will get in it's way, and the only thing you can do, is get out of it's way. It makes for a terrifying horror film, where you hope for every character but you don't have a lot of hope.As for the casting, everyone does a good job, there's no distracting performance in my opinion except the ever controversial nicolas cage. Again, this is a personnal choice but I think he's perfect. It remind me of Jack Nicholson in the Shining. It was a perfect cast because he's supposed to be creepy and go crazy, and Jack had pretty much played the creep all his life! Nicolas Cage is similar. He's supposed to go nuts and, well, he either is or acts it damn well! I truly believe he's deeply in love with his wife, he acts very well through emotional scenes and when he goes crazy, he plays perfectly. He's perfect for the part.The set and cinematography are also great, the color is great at being beautiful one second and terrifying the next. It's perfectly eary and always feels a bit off, which is the point. The whole movie is shot very, very well. It's great at hinting at things in the dark without revealing too much, yet can still capture beautiful scenery with detail whithout boxing you in a spot. The focus of the camera is really good.I think this is a kind of movie that is gonna get a lot of different reactions depending on the way you view it, what you like, your type of effects etc...

The first poor creatures on the farm that get zapped by the alien Organism are the Alpaca's, turning them into a hairless joined together mass of pink flesh, after going out to investigate Nathan's wife (Richardson) and youngest son (Hilliard) also get zapped by the alien pink beam and also end up as a hairless joined together mass of pink flesh, surprisingly Nathan doesn't seem too bothered by this and thinks they will be OK, and can't understand why they are making groaning noises.
Nathan (Cage) then decides to get in the car and go and get help, unfortunately it won't start because the battery has become drained (strangely no other vehicle or way of charging the battery is available on the farm) This is the point where Cage gives one of his most over the top performances, probably surpassing his Wicker man performance.
Nathan (Cage) then decides to take his anger out on the mutant Alpaca's by shooting them several times, unfortunately during this he becomes engulfed by a pink Alpaca fart that ends up poisoning him causing him to lose his sanity (so not much of a change really)
To cut a long story short the hero of the story local hydrologist Ward Phillips (Elliot Knight) who we saw talking to Nathan's daughter Lavinia at the beginning, turns up with the Sheriff (the poor Sheriff doesn't last long) to save the day, believing that the family's ""illness"" is caused by contaminated water, but soon finds to his Horror that it is something far more sinister, at first he tries to chat to Lavinia by the well, but finds out she has a bad case of ""Pink eye"" (or pink eyes) at this point and he ends up getting zapped,when she touches him, but rather than end up as a mound of hairless pink flesh his mind is impregnated with some horrifying images and the ""Color"" shoots out of the Well and into the sky, Ward ends up hiding in the cellar and climbs out the next morning as the soul survivor and sees a type of ash everywhere and the ""Color"" nowhere in sight.

Obviously in a movie about Colour there would be clear symbolism in its uses. I'm surprised to see few people making reference to this in reviews. The colour blue is used often to represent, what I think, represents humanity and earth, in stark contrast to the stunning salient magenta. You'll see blue everywhere from clothes to vehicles to wallpaper. It's stunning how much of it was there. For example, the Hydrologist was wearing a blue jacket and has a bright blue vehicle. Every member of the family wore blue at some point. When Cage fell off the deep end he was wearing red.Also prominent are many other Lovecraft references. Triangles, for example, are a prevalent symbolism. In Lovecraftian lore they are often gates or windows. I'll leave you to spot them all.We also have stunning visuals and effects.

The first and last 5 minutes are Lovecraftian, the rest is more suited to a poor pulp horror flick.Colour Out of Space is an interesting and suspenseful short story but one more suited to late night radio rather than TV. There are other Lovecraft stories that are far better suited to TV/Film (A Shadow Out of Time, At the Mountains of Madness, Call of Cthulhu), so why in Nyarlathotep's name choose this?Ultimately the film bears very little resemblance to the original story or any Lovecraft story for that matter. I can understand the director trying to spice things up so the film would appeal to a wider audience but he's lost Lovecraft in the process.

The apocalyptic surrealism of this horror science fiction movie is pictorialized with the beauty of the romantism , of the fantastic realism Art, of surrealism and pop surrealism , of futurism, and with some dark fantasy horror Art.
The differents acts of the story and themes in «Color out of space» makes me think to the Polyptych Art painting «Vision of the hereafter» of Hieronymus Bosch (1505-15) with the themes: Fall of the Damned, Hell, Terrestrial Paradise, Ascent of the Blessed.
But with this order in this movie of Stanley:
Terrestrial Paradise, Fall of the damned, Hell, Ascent of the blessed.Nicolas Cage and Joely Richardson play very well the opposite tempers of their characters; she uses a gesture theater, her character is more an observer and a receptor of the situations of the story, which are affecting her. He uses sometimes expressionism, sometimes existentialism, changing his face following his transformation sometimes reflexive , sometimes intensive, placing the erratic and impulsive behaviors of his character to accentuate and to define the tensions of the situations, and of his physical and mental transformation, in this existentialist huis clos.
Madeleine Arthur , Brendan Meyer and Julian Hilliard have all well find the relationship between each others ; perfectly balancing energies, powers, actions, innocence, culpability between them and toward their parents with realism.
Tommy Chong and Elliot Knight create a very good team, united by their individual marginalized characters, who become the witness and the positive gardners representatives of the Alien Color ; only them can understand it specificities, communication, and dangerousness. (..)
In this theatre of action, the present is the movments of instability and metamorphoses, cutted from the action of the past represented by the Alien color who stay outside, in the nature. First hidden in silence, invisible, the color emanation is manipulating each realities of each member of the Gardner family deeply; then it comes back by assaults, rasping, it invades, transforms, disintegrates everything and each of them, as a curse. These flows, like the running out of control from the flood of a river, formulate an elliptical distorted temporality which devors itself ; as a metaphor for the humanity self destruction, and materializing the string theory of quantum physics, it releases the passage to another dimension, the opening to a different world born in the past of the universe, in the origins of creation and becoming the future for humans who play wizards with physical, chemical, environmental and spiritual matters.""

I got to about 24 minutes before the end, and I started skipping ahead.
Bizarre dialogue, over-acting by Mr. Cage, the escalation to full-on insanity happens fairly quickly, but then pauses as we see what the Hydrologist and the town is up to, while the Alpaca Farm goes full magenta gore-fest.
I always expect a film based on a Lovecraft story to be completely demented, but past adaptations have at least been entertaining in some way with character development and reasonable (given the insanity) dialogue. Also there have been some that are darkly comedic, like Re-Animator.

With that being said, everybody in this film is either insane or absolutely pathetically stupid and lacking in appropriate fight/flight instincts. The family clearly suffers effects on their minds but moments of clarity come through for some of them. Yet they still don't have an even remotely fight or flight moment, which was very frustrating to watch. The most pathetic response comes from the hydrologist, Ward, who we are led to believe is not suffering from any psychological effects. He knows that there is a contaminant in the water and sees the daughter clearly exhibiting symptoms, as well as everybody else for that matter. Yet, Ward makes no effort to do anything drastic or call any kind of authority. Very cool film; there is a psychedelic quality that makes you feel disoriented. I just wish it didn't use the all too common trope of making characters completely inadequate in order to advance its plot. Additionally, the acting from Lavinia (Sp?) and Ward in particular is really noticeably bad.

In the final third the movie escalates and brings along with the more and more deteriorating family some really decent practical effects and a mad, fun nick cage.

Lovecraft Film Festival (HPLFF) and the Pacific NW premier of Richard Stanley's colourful Color Out of Space adaption of Lovecraft's famous story.Color shows why Stanley should do more feature films (hopefully more Lovecraft or weird tale adaptions) as his passion and his knowledge of the source material shines through... much like Lavinia's forehead. It is also a very personal film for Richard as it touches on elements from his own life.Over all the film is solid and I think the cinematography is great with very well-done CGI. Richard focuses on the family as he should but it feels like the movie has been edited down as we have gaps in the appearance of certain characters who only appear in the first and last acts. The most creepy and unnerving scene is with actor Tommy Chong near the end of the film... it is really perfect. The weakest part of the film for me is Nicholas Cage ... he is okay but distracts from the film at times. I would have preferred to have seen more of Madeleine Arthur as Lavinia Gardner.Overall I am giving this an 8 since it is a serious attempt at a Lovecraft adaptation and hits the cosmic horror nail on the head... however I think most mainstream viewers won't get the love to source material and give it a much lower rating.""It was just a colour out of space - a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes."" -- H.P.

583,HaplessFan,"Poor Script and ""Acting"" Derail Source Material",1,9 August 2020,"This movie was relentlessly terrible. It's like a ""straight to video"" rip-off of the far superior Slither (2006), which actually succeeded as a gory, clever, creepy, and even funny sci-fi horror film. This adaptation of Color Out of Space, however, was a slapdash hot mess, possibly geared toward audiences with the attention spans of adolescent gnats and the IQs to match. A few quotes from Lovecraft's classic short story are thrown into the mix, and are also used as bookends in an unsuccessful attempt to lend the film some coherence and gravitas; they just end up sounding like they belong in a better movie (probably because they do).
This movie also marks a new low (in a career comprised of desperate plunges to unsounded depths) for Nicholas Cage. While all of the other actors attempted to play it straight (necessary to connect viewers to stories this ""out there""), Cage seemed to be performing in a completely different film: a comedy, perhaps (though not a very good one). He spent his screen time munching scenery in a vacuum, connecting not at all with any of his co-stars. It was impossible to look at or listen to him for even a moment without thinking, ""this is an actor trying to act."" (Almost nothing takes me out of a movie faster.) There was no humanity at all in his performance; it was an embarrassingly bad SNL caricature. Some might maintain that the role demanded a certain remote zaniness, but at this point in time, horror film aficionados have seen many a movie maniac portrayed by actors who deftly manage to make connections, spark some chemistry, or at least create some much-needed tension with their scene-mates. Cage's performance in this movie was a joke, rarely even unintentionally funny.
I don't often write reviews, but as a fan of both horror films and Lovecraft's stories, I had to at least post a warning in light of all the oddly effusive positive reviews this has gotten.
I'm not a snob when it comes to horror flicks; I often give these movies a pass if they can provide just one or two good chills; or if they can establish and then stick with their own rules. This does neither. There are a few strangely dated looking gross-out effects, but the only truly scary thing about Color Out of Space is that this is apparently just the first of several Lovecraft-inspired films planned by the same director. If you do want a gross and gooey alien invasion movie that actually delivers, take my earlier advice and check out Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker in James Gunn's Slither; don't waste your time or money on this boring, messy garbage.",Color Out of Space

588,mabalododge,"Wow, I honestly didn't think it was possible!",7,1 November 2020,"TLDR its not a 1:1 retelling of the original short story, but it uses that to its advantage to show the horror in a way that wouldnt otherwise be possible in a film about fictional colors. The comedy falls short, as does some minor aspects of the acting. But overall its a great watch for any fan of cosmic horror. Or person who hates jumpscares and wants some real tension.No spoiler section:""Nicolas Cage, in a H.P. Lovecraft story? You must be joking... and what , a story about a color that doesn't exist?! How do they plan to adapt that in a visual media!?""
Was my first reaction apon learning about this movie. It took a long time for me to get around to watching it. Now im a big cosmic horror fan, and so I do adore my Lovecraft stories, but I honestly did not believe a story like this would be possible to adapt. But they did, and it somehow worked.Needless to say this is a story I think the less you know about the better, being that fear of the unknown is kinda the whole theory of Lovecraft's horror. So here is what I can say without spoiling anything, The film is not a 100% accurate adaptation, and I think that's mostly a good thing in this case. The book relies heavily on using your imagination to scare yourself, more then actual horror. Where as this film uses its visual media to scare you. That being said its not all jump-scares and eerie music like most terrible horror flicks you see pop up. There is literally only one jump scare in the entire film (I guess they just really couldn't resist) And instead relies more on building up of tension with a bit of shock horror that the cosmic horror genre is familiar with. That being said this is no ""The Thing"" or ""Alien"" when it comes to quality of film or quality of horror. Of course knowing the jest of the story it would of been hard to scare me, but even so I think both previously mentioned films are still very far ahead of this as far as the usage of tension, and the buildup and release of said tension with horrific moments. However this is kinda a rare breed of film, Lovecraft's works are rarely mimicked directly, and even rarer are they adapted, And even rarer still are they adapted well. This is an example of a well made HP Lovecraft adaptation and so therefore I have to give it a thumbs up, If your a fan of cosmic horror, HP Lovecraft, or just get tired of the same old haunted doll jumpscare fests that most horror films are nowadays, Id give it a shot!
SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS:So this story changed a good bit from the original work, but as previously mentioned I think most of it was for the best. They changed the dynamics of some of the characters aswell as the main story arc itself. The meteor still lands in a farm , stuff still goes all wibbly wobbly ultra-violetty and madness does still ensue but the main perspective of the story has shifted from an outsider, to the actual farm family themselves, making it a much more personal story. I do feel however the horror of the thought of the tainted soil and land getting spread by the final flooding that is mentioned in the books and in the film wasnt nearly as leaned into as it was in the books. Which is unfortunate, because that lingering thoughts of Lovecraft's protagonists at the end of his stories, wondering about how such horrors may spread or happen again, is kinda a hallmark of the stories to me. They also (probably smartly) didnt lean into the actual color ironically enough. They only really mention its difficulty to describe once in the whole film. But instead rely on giving it more traits that are easier to mask in film, having it effect each character differently. The Father smells this horrid smell he can hardly describe until the end of the film where he describes it as being the same terrible smell he remembered from some memories with his father that he hates.
The children all have moments of hearing this sorta ringing in their ears, or the thumping of what sounds like a heart beat. These all work to inform us the audience they are experiencing the side effects of the color, and give us that sense of ""wrongness"" about whats going on that the book gave us by simply describing the foreign hues of the plants and environment. Also by setting the story in a more modern time, we see how the color effects the TV, Cell phones, Cameras ect. And altho I think the scenes of the scientists studying samples of the rock being replaces by some simple water studies was lackluster, I also dont think it degraded the feeling of supernatural phenomena that lovecraft was going for in the book much.Outside of the adaptation itself as others have already mentioned there is some really bad comedy in the story, and some of the character interactions feel a bit forced. Specifically to me the brother-sister relationship between the two teen kids really didnt feel realistic to me. I could see what they were going for, having them insult each other and such, but then turn to each other in their times of need, but it just didnt feel natural, it felt like two young actors saying lines at each other.THE HORROR:
So here is the most subjective part of the review, my review of the horror itself. Now as I mentioned, it would be hard to scare me I think considering I already knew most of was likely to happen. I knew the mother was going to end up all messed up (altho I expected her to be more a zombie who turns to dust and less a Cronenberg with her son) I knew the water was going to be the thing messing with them, and frankly I knew by the end of it all of them were going to be mad or dead, and that the only one to survive would be the scientist character. But that being said the sense of tension building was there regardless. You know something is going to happen, but you dont know what. And I think they actually did this surprisingly well. Never before was I on the edge of my seat watching someone cut carrots before now. But seriously they did a pretty good job here. I will say the body horror and "" The Thing"" esque monsters they added to the story were kinda creepy, but maybe its because im desensitized to those kinda things because of their recent popularity in horror. But I just didnt find them that scary. That being said the actual effects were really good. Im not sure how much was practical and how much was CGI but I would guess at least a good bit was practical, due to the way they shot it (and well literally shot it too) but I would guess most of the effects with the mom were CGI where the Cronenberg Alpaca was probably the source of most of the practical effects.There was also some nice subtle choices they did to show the characters going mad without having to beat you over the head with it by having people saying ""HES GOING CRAZY WATCH OUT!"" or whatever. A great example is early in the film we see the Father talking to his wife, and he mentions how he hated how his father used to talk to him and then gives a brief demonstration to her. This didnt feel out of place and just seemed like a normal piece of dialogue until later in the film when he starts going crazy he starts putting on that same silly voice and talking like his father. Or how in that same scene its setup that he hates his father, yet later he asks ""Isnt that right Dad?"" while sitting down next to a photo, almost proudly exclaiming in a way you would hear anyone who had great admiration for a father. The way im explaining it here makes it seem more clumsy then it was in the film. Maybe it was a bit on the nose but overall Ill take any form of subtle nod to that rather than have someone spout exposition at me for 5 minutes just to tell me a character is going crazy.Overall as an avid Lovecraft fan I must say im impressed.I rate it 7 for ""G-spot"" not being the most offensive name for a pussy cat in a Lovecraft story, out of 10 ;)",Color Out of Space

I approached it with cautious optimism, but what I ended up with was a boring, poorly acted, genuinely cheap looking film that managed to disappoint me despite my tempered expectations.Over the years I actually gave some thought to how one might realize a film adaptation of this story, and honestly this version made it's first mistake before shooting even started, which is to shoot the film in color and make the titular color just pink. I have heard some elaborate explanations of how it's some sort of ultraviolet or something but that's honestly nonsense. It's pink, the audience experiences it as pink and Nicolas Cage even acknowledges it being pink in one of the scenes. Furthermore the writing, acting and ESPECIALLY the special effects are very weak and make it feel like a TV production.

592,ariellemaltais,8.5/10 should be the real score for this movie.,7,22 September 2020,"When you eliminate the reviews by the non-cultist reviewers ;P you can see this is one of the best adaptation of Lovecraft.Negative point:
-A bit to much alpaca jokes
-The pocket book ""Necronomicon""
-I would have love to see a bit more protection provided by the symbols Lavinia used
-Sadly diffucult to enjoy for general viewers
-The narrator Ward Phillips is a bit absent not enough implicate with the family. Following the family through him would have help to get an attachement point witch can't be done with the family and it's a huge flaw in the movie.
The biggest problem in my opinion was the progression of the madness difficult to see if you're not real carefull. If the characters would have expressed it more verbally it would have been great i think.Good points:
-Erza is an awesome character and Tommy Chong was brillant
-Nicolas Cage deliver as hell. Damn is he turning scary with the progression of the madness.
-Special effects are perfects, beautiful and scary. Representing the color was a tough challenge and they nail it.
-Disturbing 100% and you keep asking WTF...Hell is appening all along and it's exactly what you're suppose to ask...and never get an answer!",Color Out of Space
