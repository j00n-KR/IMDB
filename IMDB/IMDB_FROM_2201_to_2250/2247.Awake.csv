0,Leofwine_draca,Very generic,4,12 August 2021,"Another boringly predictable apocalypse movie. Plays it safe and generic throughout without a single surprise in the whole darn thing. Very similar to previous films like GREENLAND, BIRDBOX et al but even more passive than those. Unlikeable protagonists it's very tough to care about or feel for and an obvious MacGuffin in the form of a young immune girl who must be protected at all costs. Lots of effort, expanse and energy have gone into the production of this one, but it all adds up to so little that you wonder why they bothered...",Awake
1,SnoopyStyle,solution too obvious,6,12 June 2021,"Jill (Gina Rodriguez) steals expired drugs from work. She's on probation for drugs and was forced to surrender custody of her two children to her mother. It's a struggle to stay on the straight and narrow. Something happens and all the electronics in the world are rendered inoperative. Then something worst happens. Nobody can sleep. Dr. Murphy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) leads a military operation to find a cure.Anybody remember The Quiet Earth (1985). The two premises have a lot of similarities. The problem with this movie is that the solution is obvious right from the start. The story needs to hide that. It can't show its hand. It makes Jill look stupid to not realize something so obvious. The other problem is having annoying stupid kids. It's a minor problem which exists a lot of times and I'm willing to overlook it. I can't overlook the fact that nobody would be stupid enough to not see what makes Matilda different. In the end, I'm a sucker for this type of high concept sci-fi. It could done better. I wish the kids are less annoying especially the boy. I do like Jill trying to teach Matilda how to survive. It's a good sci-fi writing exercise but it does need some minor tweaks.",Awake
2,nogodnomasters,You need to be woke,6,23 August 2021,"The world ""blinks"" as all microchips are fried, the electric goes out, and all of a sudden no one can sleep. The story centers on single mother Jill (Gina Rodriguez) and her family as they fight to survive a world gone mad from lack of sleep. They were involved in a car accident at the time of the incident. Matilda (Ariana Greenblatt) has no trouble sleeping through this film, and neither should you. The ""hub"" wants to study her to save the world before it is too late.It was nice to see crowds going crazy for sleeping pills instead of toilet paper for a change. I thought the acting was good. The cause was credible to lay people. I wish they had done more with the plot.Guide: F-word. Nudity.",Awake
3,kosmasp,Sleepless,6,29 August 2021,"A really interesting main and central idea ... what would happen if for some reason we couldn't sleep anymore? And would there be some people who were immune to that? Also would that be mother nature getting rid of us? So many questions, almost none will be answered to most viewers satisfaction I reckon.The movie is anything but perfect and filled with cliches. Predictable and sort of weird in not a good sense at places. Convenient road interactions aside and the ever reliable bad military trope ... there is fun to be had, if you suspend your disbelief and make it work yourself.",Awake
4,paul_haakonsen,Lots of potential that ended up in mediocrity...,5,26 July 2021,"Sure, ""Awake"" was watchable, but the movie was just one of those movie that you watch once, because it is adequately entertaining, but then you forget about the movie and never return to it again.And that is because there were just way too many things in the movie that made so little sense. I especially found it ludicrous that society would break out in anarchy after such a short time. Sure, I get that staying awake for prolonged periods of time starts to affect the brain, but come on, for people to start looting, killing each other and such, nah, that was just a bit too far fetched.The storyline in ""Awake"" definitely had some interesting enough aspects. But ultimately, then writers Joseph Raso, Mark Raso and Gregory Poirier just managed to come up with a mediocre storyline.I will say that the acting performances put on in ""Awake"" were fair, and while I am not overly familiar with actress
Gina Rodriguez, she actually carried the movie quite well with her performance.I had expected a bit more from director Mark Raso with this 2021 movie. Sure, it made for an adequate enough watch, but it just wasn't a wow-moment.My rating of ""Awake"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",Awake
5,siderite,A better than average end of the world film,8,9 June 2021,"This is one of those films where something terrible happens so everybody goes completely nuts and a single mom has to save her children. I don't understand why in movies whenever something world altering happens, Americans start shooting each other almost immediately, but that's what all of them show, including Awake. Then there are the children, which are always incredibly dumb and put everybody in danger multiple times and only survive because it's in the script. Children are usually less experienced than adults, but they are not all idiots.However, all that aside, the film was quite good for its genre. It was acted OK, it had a clear and concise story, it only lasted one hour and a half and the main character wasn't an emotional wreck crying and needing to be saved all the time either. Was it a good film in general? Not really, but I've stopped wishing for intelligence and complexity in disaster movies a long time ago.Bottom line: a very simple premise that needed no special effects or mumbo jumbo, a linear and well produced storyline, decent acting. For this type of movie, it was a lot better than the average.",Awake
6,Cineanalyst,A Movie that Crushes Dreams,4,15 June 2021,"It's as though the actors were sleepwalking through their parts.... Now that I got that out of my system, given that ""Awake"" is apocalyptically about people suddenly no longer being able to sleep, it's ironic I saw it when I was quite tired myself but unable to nod off. Perhaps, that affected my critical thinking, as sleep deprivation assuredly does the characters here, so that's my caveat before I pan this rubbish. I've also gone without snoozing for more than 48 hours before, so I know for a fact that it'd at least take longer than that--assuming such would ever happen--until I lost my mind to the point of going on a paranoid killing spree or starting a child-sacrifice cult. Not so with characters in this movie, though, as the disintegration of society, albeit accelerated by the complimentary loss of electronics, escalates way too quickly. Otherwise, the extinction narrative is entertaining enough, I suppose, and the ultimate resolution is rather amusing. I could overlook whatever other minor problems, too, including that needless temporary avoidance of showing a male doctor and minor character's face in one scene, if there were something more clever underneath it all. Again, I was fatigued, but I didn't see anything like that.That's what comparisons to another Netflix release, ""Bird Box"" (2018), are missing. Sure, both threaten the existence of humanity, feature people going nuts and otherwise losing an ability, and are anchored by a woman finding maternal redemption by guiding a son and a daughter through the newfound disorder on their quest for refuge. With ""Bird Box,"" however, the lost sense is sight, lest one be terrified by suicidal nightmares. Gimmicky, perhaps, but quite cinematically reflexive, as motion pictures are primarily a visual art form. Similar to another such movie, ""Blindness"" (2008), in that way. Dreams are also associative with movies. Yet, ""Awake"" squanders any opportunity there by eradicating dreaming. Even for those who can sleep, we're never welcomed into that internal space. The closest we get is a case of delirium.It's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956, 1978, 1993, 2007), but reversed, to the exclusion of anything intelligent. With the body snatchers, also nominally from space, as with the supposed solar flare cause here, and which also doesn't really matter, the result was the same that the heroes avoided slumber. But, that was merely the story that seemed to hide a pod containing something much deeper. Whether that's the common interpretations of political allegory, psychological ones, or the reflexivity of sleep being equated with a death of acting and replacement by other actors, or the argument I supported in my reviews that the brilliance was merely in its offering itself for interpretation, the point is that the better ""Body Snatchers"" films are complex and thoughtful. ""Awake"" is not; indeed, in removing critical thinking and dreams, it's quite the opposite.",Awake
7,cruise01,Decent thriller.,6,8 July 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Awake is a fair thriller film about a cataclysmic event that causes everyone to have difficulty sleeping.

Boring script that gives forgettable characters. And dull direction.,Awake
8,Tweetienator,Standard Netflix Production,4,9 June 2021,"Some people compare Awake with Bird Box (S. Bullock) but whereas I was highly entertained and thrilled by the latter one (my rate: 7), I watched Awake rather drowned in an ocean of indifference. Awake simply lacks of thrill and action and the story told unfolds very slowly and there are just too many scenes and dialogues that are all cliche in. In this sense Awake reminds me a lot of Greenland (2020, Gerard Butler), which also tells us a story that works more or less on auto-pilot: scenes after scenes we watched million times before. In short: the script is (like in so many movies these days) the weakest link (the ending is not only a cheap twist but a joke too), and whereas movies like Bird Box or The Road are top contributions to the genre of post-apocalyptic movies, Awake sails close on the edge of boredom.Last note: the writer and director should have done some experiments with sleep deprivation: I managed 10 days (back then in my younger years) without the necessity of a visit of a mental institute and/or the notion to run havoc or beat up my fellow humans ;)",Awake

16,Kamurai25,"""Alan, Go to Sleep!""",7,19 June 2021,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is no ""Day 5"" (A Rooster Teeth series where people who fall asleep never wake again). This is more like a twisted opposite of that, but still interesting. Watching characters slowly go insane has a certain level of appeal to it when it comes to stories. It's an onboard clock to how far the story can be pushed.The cast does a great job of leaning into the characters and their situations, the story itself is decent, but does lean quite a bit on the concept alone.The movie distracts from it's main plot from being about a mom and her two kids, this creates dependencies that wouldn't usually exist in apocalyptic survivor groups. It allows for some predictability as well as limiting in what is sensible for the characters to do.The movie compensates well enough and the bigger problem, to me is the ""special child"" trope it uses.Definitely worth a watch, and refreshing to see a somewhat innovative idea come along.",Awake
17,nancyldraper,"Great performance, okay movie",6,15 June 2021,"I'd be willing to bet this was written by an insomniac. Interesting premise. Good performances. Gina Rodriguez may be the attraction but Ariana Greenblatt is the stand out star, as she has been and will be most of her career. Beside the performances of Rodriguez and Greenblatt, there is nothing special about this movie. It does, however, leave itself with a real sequel issue at the end.

18,arungeorge13,This Netflix film is the perfect example of wasted potential! [+34%],3,10 June 2021,"I did not like Bird Box (another NETFLIX apocalypse movie) and I certainly did not like this one. Apart from Gina Rodriguez's convincing performance (in the latter half) as an insomniac, there's nothing holding the film together. Characters lack motivation, scenes lack tension, the solution(s) to the film's core issues lack credibility. It's a shame because Awake has an intriguing premise. In the hands of a more capable writer-director, this could have turned out a lot better. Even the (occasionally dysfunctional) 'family' angle is poorly developed, which in turn, does away with the emotional connection between viewers and the protagonists. Jennifer Jason Leigh is completely wasted once again (after The Woman in the Window). Oh, and there's some unintentional humour too!",Awake

22,IonicBreezeMachine,"An interesting enough hook undermined by underdeveloped characters, a miscast lead, and workman like structure.",4,11 June 2021,"Troubled veteran Jill Adams (Gina Rodriguez) and her estranged children, Noah and Mathilda (Lucius Hoyos and Ariana Greenblatt respectively), face a strange event that disables communications and infrastructure and leaves all of humanity in a state of insomnia. As society breaks down, Jill finds that her daughter Mathilda is able to sleep and learning of military controlled hub where another ""sleeper"" is being studied sets out to on a last ditch effort to save her family in a world gone mad from sleeplessness.Awake, the new feature from Copenhagen and Kodachrome writer-director Mark Raso and his brother co-writer Joseph Raso of Disney Channel's Zombies TV movie franchise carries an interesting hook with a pandemic of insomnia having gripped humanity. While there's probably a good story utilizing that concept somewhere, Awake unfortunately isn't it as it's a plodding predictable slog that hits all the standard beats of a film like this with little if any personality added to them.Awake feels like it's cut from a similar cloth to something like Bird Box or A Quiet Place where it wants to take recognized hurdle (in this case insomnia) and build an apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic story around it. Unlike Bird Box, A Quiet Place, or The Silence this isn't a monster movie and the threat comes more from societal breakdown with film's such as The Trigger Effect, Blindness, or to some extent Stephen King's The Mist serving as apt comparisons wherein humanity is arguably a greater threat. I think the filmmaker's may have realized their premise doesn't have all that much meat to it because the movie feels really rush with society breaking down to near The Purge levels of insanity and mayhem within the first 20 minutes of screen time. None of the societal breakdown elements are all that interesting and are pretty much done with the bare minimum of effort and we have pretty much all the familiar stand-bys of the genre with religious fanatics, looters, roving prisoners, and rogue military units all serviving as the standard apocalypse obstacles that would be all well and good if the build up or characters were the least bit interesting, but not only is everything too rushed with the scenario escalating from 1-11 before we even know the main character's names (seriously) but the characters are so one dimensional that it's impossible to care.Gina Rodriguez of TV's Jane the Virgin tries to play against type in a role similar Tom Cruise's in War of the Worlds or John Cusack's in 2012 and unfortunately it's clear it doesn't fit her at all. While I do like Gina Rodriguez as an actress, she is hopelessly miscast as a hard edge ex-military burnout and just doesn't convey the needed intensity to sell this role, in a way it's sort of the opposite situation that plagued Mark Wahlberg's performance in M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening abeit less funny. Lucius Hoyos and Ariana Greenblatt playing Jill's are incredibly bland basically playing variations on the emotionally distant teenage son (complete with calling his mother by her first name as an act of ""rebellion"") and the precocious daughter who thanks to her status as a sleeper serves as less a character and more a combination macguffin and deus ex Machina (which the audience will be WAY ahead of the characters in figuring out). There are brief performances by actors who try to give some substance to underwritten roles such as Barry Pepper as a former drug addict turned Pastor who tires to keep his congregation from resorting to extremism in what's a nice change of play against type for this type of character, but he's gone from the movie after maybe 3 or 4 minutes (probably for the best for his sake). Shamier Anderson of Syfy's Wyonna Earp as Dodge plays a reformed convict who protects our heroes from the evil convicts and does fine for the most part, but it's such an underwritten role any goodwill from the character basically comes more from actor than character.Awake has a mildly intriguing premise, but doesn't have any idea where to take it or how to explore it and settles for generic apocalypse road movie tropes. Gina Rodriguez is miscast in a role that doesn't play to her strengths and while there are a few decent performances from reliable character actors most of the supporting performances range from bland to unintentionally funny. The movie isn't unintentionally funny like The Happening, doesn't try to make any allegorical or satirical point like Blindness or The Trigger Effect, nor does it try to be over the top exploitation like The Purge, it's just a bland by the numbers point A-B thriller designed to take up space and be forgotten.",Awake

Except they swapped out the zombies for people suffering from insomnia caused by an extraterrestrial event that affects the earth. Kinda reminded me of Stephen King's, The Crazies.Anyway, the writing is very poor and not well thought out. If everyone is suffering from sleep deprivation, why would the country arm soldiers against the population? Soldiers aiming their assault weapons against civilians?

Gina Rodriguez was good in this movie as she played the mother who tried to protect her kid while slowly losing her mind.It's funny how ironic this movie was: the characters cannot sleep, but the movie itself was putting me to sleep! The beginning when the event started was not bad. However, as the movie went on, it became so slow and boring. It felt like nothing happened in this movie. The director tried for some cool angles and effects, but those didn't help making the story any better.The premise was actually interesting and unique, but the script went for a generic thriller with nothing special to offer. However, the movie was unintentionally hilarious at a point. One character saw a dropped pine cone and thought it was a grenade.The last act was a bit chaotic with some violence because people started to lose their marbles.

I strongly defend that every single genre has phenomenal and awful movies, all of which should be seen by audiences. Often, people ignore ""bad films"" as if they're not necessary, but without them, cinephiles wouldn't be able to truly appreciate when a gem comes around. Awake is neither, but it does feature an original idea that could have been much better explored.Gina Rodriguez (Kajillionaire) is quite good as the worrying mother, but performances can only carry the movie until a certain point. Joseph Raso and Mark Raso's screenplay isn't able to develop a unique ""end-of-the-world"" concept in a surprising, captivating manner, following the generic plot points and predictable outcomes. Despite the short runtime, it still holds some pacing issues that unnecessarily drag the film. As with every other flick of this genre, questionable actions and events must be blindly accepted by the audience to avoid nitpicking logical issues.It's still somewhat entertaining due to the genre itself, but it all feels underwhelming compared to the genuinely interesting premise.""Rating: C-",Awake

33,bregund,Poorly written,2,13 June 2021,"It was nice to see Gina Rodriguez and Jennifer Jason Leigh together again after one of my favorite films, Annihilation, but this film is awful. I get that the production values are low, that there's a limited budget, that Christopher Nolan's name doesn't come anywhere near this film, but at the very least Netflix you can hire good writers. Skillful writing is the cornerstone of all good entertainment, and can easily mitigate a lot of problems associated with a low budget or bad special effects...you can still enjoy the story if it's written well. This film doesn't even have that. Instead of naturally evolving as part of the dynamics among the characters, the central concept of the story is introduced about ten minutes in, bluntly introduced as an idea that the characters and the viewers are suddenly supposed to accept. High concept films aren't supposed to work this way. Children of Men begins in media res. 2012 takes high-concept from the very beginning and rolls it out so you can see the full effect of the concept. Awake doesn't do either of these things, it occupies an uncomfortable middle ground that quickly turns the film into a B movie.I had to stop watching when the creepy pastor leaves the main room of the church and goes into another room where Gina's daughter is sitting, and begins talking to her as though she's an adult and can understand everything he's babbling about, all without her grandmother present. Suddenly the girl wonders aloud if she has to die because she knows how to sleep. What? How? Who? When?

Despite the talented ideas throughout the film, Awake just doesn't leave you satisfied enough to call the film ""really enjoyable"". But it's still unfair to say that this Netflix flick wasn't good enough.The film's plot and ideas are both great! The film's bright plans were obviously thought out and, to sci-fi fans especially, the story is sufficiently acceptable. Unfortunately, the film's scheme was exhausted by the time the story started slowing down to an exciting but long-stretched climax. Without providing spoilers, the film ends satisfying, but un-assuring.What else disintegrates it all? The performances... The acting throughout the film is totally, unexpectedly too strong. The emotions of the characters are portrayed too heavy, causing the rest of the story to fall apart.Therefore, check out this movie if you're a sci-fi or even a Bird Box fan. Other than the film's design, the acting is too strong and the climax is honestly slow. It's highly not recommended that you advance into the the great-looking story with a high anticipation, because it's likely that the ending will leave you unsatisfied and wanting more information.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Awake

I knew I should have turned it off at the very beginning when a car with 3 people in it crashes into a lake nearly killing an 8 -10 year old girl and then they walk home for the mother to simply ask ""Where's the car"" and the answer ""It's in the lake."" Mom frowns and walks away. No question at all about why or how the car ended up in a lake. It doesn't get much better from there. As the synopsis says it's about some phenomenon in which people can no longer sleep along, though a couple can. As the world goes bonkers due to sleep deprivation the 8 - 10 aforementioned girl solves the worldwide problem! However, her solution as to how to be able to sleep is a tad tricky, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do, Nobody's any good in this, but what has happened to Barry Pepper's career?!

In fact, it was only that because a movie needs a plot ;>I'd rather watch this than, for example, the movie with people wearing bandanas over their eyes. I *really* hate being jerked around by movies, and there is so much of that coming out of Hollywood. Nothing of that here.The direction is very good, the settings are good, and well-filmed. The acting is great, right across the board - not one actor is asked to do something that they can't do - they are all up to the task, and more. The two young actors playing the children are also good, and fortunately their characters are very sympathetic.The movie is about love, family, the drive to live, to protect, to carry on, about selflessness, hope, just all kinds of good things. Imagine a sci-fi apocalypse movie that delivers all that, and a great ending, too.I love apocalypse movies, bad sci-fi movies - this is neither of them.

A few people, worldwide, will be lucky enough to survive this... if they were unlucky to have died at the right time and were resuscitated (a kind of reboot).I can't even call this a Hollywood style apocalyptic event: where a good number of people survive and try to rebuild (or whatever). This is a doom and gloom event. People generally don't like hopeless situations in their films.I've seen lots of films (and TV shows) that pull the 'bait and switch': ie, promise a world calamity but everyone gets saved at the last minute by the actions of a few people. Or there are so many survivors that it never feels apocalyptic.This films delivers something that few others ever have - a truly humanity-ending event. It focuses on a single family's journey through this ordeal and does so in a compelling way.Gina Rodriguez was remarkable in the lead: portraying a mother who had already battled through life and been humbled by it. No... she wasn't Rambo or James Bond or John Wick or some other ridiculous Hollywood invention. She's the everyday that's been beaten up in life, battling past demons but mostly... a mother fighting for her children.There's a realism to this film, a desperation and enough honest drama to make this an easy 8 rating.

Mind you she was the same in Annihilation (the only other film I've seen her in). They do try and speed the mental breakdown up by stating near the beginning whatever is affecting people is speeded up 2 or 3 times. The thing about this film is you watch it to the end to see what it was about. The film doesn't grab your attention all the way through. At times it meanders off and attention is lost.

It's also not a movie that's a 9 or 10.There are some good things here, and some not so good things. The lead female protagonist does an excellent job coming across as a flawed person who has a background in drug abuse. Her acting is actually very good, as was most of the acting throughout the movie. The pace of the movie is good, in that it kept me engaged until the end. Anyone who says this is a boring movie simply isn't being honest. The concept is unique, and the movie carries its plot well.What's not so good is that you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit. The church scene was un-necessary and a bit stereotypical of religions nuts abandoning the same morals they base their religion on. I wanted to see a bit more buildup towards the anarchy, as it came too quickly to be plausible. And an explanation, or at least an adequate hint as to why everything was happening, would have been nice. The final scene involving the military was horrible, and was typical of using nameless soldiers as fodder for the interjection of thrill-violence. First, everyone knew hallucinations was a part of the deal, and yet numerous soldiers were allowed free access to their weaponry, without any sort of contingency to account for said hallucinations. Also, it's very difficult to effectively operate an assault rife when you are at an advanced state of sleep deprivation. And I question the body mechanics at the point, too. There was no accounting for fatigue, in that, yes, people may not have had the ability to actually sleep, but multiple days of sleep deprivation would have rendered people in a collective lethargic state, lying around, not being able to move readily, or with intent. The bloodbath at the end, full of energetic soldiers moving on point, defied on logic even when suspension was disbelief was engaged.Overall, this is a good one-timer movie, with a few flaws (that little girl was quite adept with various things for her age), some terrific acting, and a plot that was entertaining enough.6.5/10.",Awake

Everything happens too fast in the first half of Act 1.Only one day has passed and everyone is freaking out. People get shot and sacrifices are being suggested. We are given very early in the movies an excuse, the effects of this particular sleep deprevation start manifesting 2 to 3 times faster. WHY¿ There was no build up and we barely witnessed the chaos taking form. Also the main characters didn't seem to very affected by the aforementioned accelaration. It was overall a very silly start.Then the rest of this boring, bland movie happens. Character development scenes that never paid off, a character was forgotten by the end of the movie and in order to keep track of the main character's backstory, you actually had to pay close attention. The problem is Awake never earns your attention and almost none of those detail ever come into play.And yeah, there is a religious aspect scarcely woven into the plot, but I'm not sure what the writers were trying to convey. Maybe it's just me, trying to convince myself that I didn't watch a movie about nothing.",Awake

And it often feels like you've missed a scene (mother and kids run through the woods after having escaped a church where someone was murdering people; a scene before, mother and son were in separate rooms and neither had an obvious way out of there).Protagonist's bad decision making:* Leaving your functioning car unsupervised (in a world without functioning cars) with your little girl sleeping inside.* Letting your tiny kid drive the car. Result: getting assaulted by a bunch of lunatics when you get stopped on the road and can't change seats fast enough.* Protagonist sneaking into the army base instead of just announcing herself - after all, she was invited.It did have potential though, and I watched it to the end. The pacing was good and the idea was interesting: people can no longer sleep and are in a hurry to find a cure before everyone dies. How would people deal with that? Even the army people start to behave erratically at some point, which makes sense, sleep deprivation and frustration getting to them too.

And at times, things do jump forward a bit where we aren't showed all of what is happening or has happened. The premise while good, could have used more work before filming it.

The stage was not really set.Bad Science: Sleep isn't a positive, it's the absence of activity that induces sleep. It isn't something that can be lost. That's why people can't sleep when they really want to.The kid, Matilda, and the old lady who can sleep are normal. Why would you want to take their blood samples to see what's wrong. On the other hand they should experiment on the guys who can't sleep. They're the abnormal ones. The whole scene of the ape with his brain left open is laughable. He would die of meningitis in hours :) The director should have done more research before shooting the film.Ether? Really? Who uses ether today? Not even in animal labs. They're drugging the child with Ether. There's Propofol. A little expensive but I'm sure Hollywood
can afford it :)

167,wildernessbarbie,"Yes, There Was A Reason... Sort Of",4,16 June 2021,"This film had so much potential... novel take on post apocalyptic genre without having to rely heavily on big CGI alien/zombie/plague scenes. Many truly great actors, Gina Rogriguez and her daughter especially. It's shot well, production values are fine. Location for the final act was weird, but excusable.However... it's completely ruined by the pacing. For completely unknown reasons (budget is my best guess, but not good enough), they instantly and dramatically compress the timeline. Because... reasons... people are losing their minds after one night of no sleep. To the point of being immediately willing to sacrifice the one innocent child among them who CAN sleep, instead of sending her to Doctors who might help us all.It comes across as lazy, rushed, doesn't give us time to care about or hate characters we should, and leaves too many red herrings scattered around to die, never to be addressed again.Was Grandma a nut job before this? Was that church some fundamentalist cult to begin with? What did the Mom do in the military to get in trouble? Was she committing war crimes with the Psychiatrist or trying to prevent them? A massive solar flare that big that we had no warning about? That also knocks dozens of satellites out of the atmosphere? Is it also happening on the side of the earth away from the sun? The military should know with shielded communication options. So yea, those three people are alive... Mom could have brain damage, especially with those half-assed chest compressions. Dodge is dead? Or is he? Why? What good is it for them to be alive, really? It's too late to save anyone else.The Mom is heartbreakingly smart and tough about trying to teach her daughter survival skills, and despite apparently knowing full well the horrors of sleep deprivation (because some mysterious military thing) and being awake for days on end, not once do we see her (or anyone else for that matter) simply drinking or consuming anything in an effort to stay alert, not even an energy drink.If they had dragged it out more, made the effort to stay awake more desperate, the slide into paranoia and madness more gradual and subtle, this could have really been great. Stephen King's Sleeping Beauties did a brilliant job of this in his book.As it was, it all felt like a waste. A waste of talent, plot, director, crew, and my time.

Most people can definitely relate to being overtired and I find that a great premise. The ""heart"" of this movie is a family drama. It plays okay at times , too cliche at others. Direction isn't great-some of the performances suffer because of it. The pacing and production design is good. This movie is very watchable, I didn't find it boring really at all the story continues to move forward throughout its run time .Then there is the last 30 minutes of this film. I don't say this lightly but the ""twist"" is worse than The Happening. The entire film was building toward something that ultimately completely misses. Like bad. Real bad. I also don't say this lightly but the ending is as bad as Blumhouse's ""Truth or Dare.""All and all the first hour I thought was pretty decent.

But it being a movie there isn't a rest of the season....So the movie had to end.... which meant no explanation on why everyone stays awake , everyone suddenly going bezerk and killing each other.

Acting skills appeared to be too calculated. For me, I had high hopes for Gina Rodriguez because of what I've heard about her series and other movies but all I got were emotions on command and not necessarily anchoring one situation to the next one. I.e. The scene where she and her son where handcuffed in a room, she never said anything to check on him or to console him. The only time she reacted was when he was taken by a soldier.The writers could have done a better job doing research about sleep deprivation, how it works, how long does it take to reach to a level of mania, and do sleep deprived people really behave like they're about to go out of breath?Everything happened so fast too quickly and at the same time, so many things are happening so quickly. I understand that we're trying to evoke mania, anarchy, etc. And you can achieve that without making the overall arrangements of scenes chaotic too.After the supposed ""solar flare"" and all electronics and machines died, people started having consciousness of what's happening from the get go without a briefer.. so, you guys just knew that everyone is not falling asleep and that you have to do something the next morning?

189,Stealthy-22960,Great concept but the rest is an epic fail,1,25 October 2021,"1) I give the concept of this sci-fi solid 8.2) The storytelling and pacing is a mess.So after only 1 night, people have determined that only a very select few people could sleep and now there is this whole military science operation to study it? So people can't be traumatized by the events (electronics going out) and have insomnia? All of a sudden scientists have already determined that insomnia is now permanent? And all of this happens pretty quickly within the movie without building to this idea that something is off (and not just the electronics). And, what about the mother losing custody of her children for possessing/distributing or using drugs yet was able to get a cushy security job at a building with a pharmacy? Lol What?! Or the fact everyone now knows cars are inoperable, yet she just casually leaves her bike in the street while going back to her mom's house for her kids and then was surprised someone stole the bike? This is a woman who is supposed to be so street savvy to steal prescriptions and sell these drugs to unsavory characters?3) The acting and directing... whew.Ok the son belongs on those cheesy Disney shows. He appeared at least 16 in the movie but was acting like a toddler. I mean he didn't have the sense to undo his seatbelt while the water from the lake took forever and a day to even fill the car. And don't get me started on the mother (lead actress). She was as wooden as they come. Her body language and movement never quiet matched up with the intensity of any given moment or her words. The only solid actors was the grandmother and preacher.So a person gets their head blown off within the church and everyone just hangs out in a hallway with the gunman just having casual conversations? They all ran for the girl? But then got distracted in the hallway? Lol The girl was literally around the hallway up the stairs. Oh and don't get me started on the fake running. Seriously let the actors really run. It all just looked so unbelievably fake.And I'm only 35 minutes into this movie and I'm already annoyed.

194,polexia_rogue,As a Barry Pepper fan,5,11 June 2021,"As a Barry Pepper fan, I have been waiting since 2019 for this movie to finally find a place to call home. Netflix is as good of a place as any, with all of its shows based around the thriller/horror genre.Basically, this is a zombie apocalypse movie. An illness overtakes the population, and everyone is either running, fighting, or trying to find a cure.In the case of Awake, it's an odd alien-like ""solar flare"" that knocks out the electricity to the entire world. All modern cars stop, phones, computers, and even humans. Humans (and some monkeys) can no longer sleep and it's driving people insane.No spoilers but Barry Pepper is only in the first 1/3 of the movie. He is truly inspiring as the town pastor. As a man of God, he tries to calm people by suggesting that humans are just being tested. At one point he tells the story of when he died of an overdose, only to come back to life (God has a plan for all of us.)His story sort of gives away the 'cure' that the main characters find a bit too late. IMO.While trying to keep his congregation from attacking each other (because their sleep-deprived minds are hearing their own ""instructions from God"",) he meets an uncertain, off-screen fate. (involving a gunshot.):(I watched the movie until the end. It has a very ""spiritual/Christian"" movie ending, surrounded by an ocean of blood and death. I appreciate the creativity that went into the concept (and even the ending. )But I can see why it struggled so long to find a platform.5/10.",Awake
195,macdaddy3598,"Great, conceptually",7,10 June 2021,"Littered with unnecessary subplots brought down what could have been a strong movie throughout.The lead character being a recovering addict and drug dealer added nothing to the conversation. The writers would have done better by making her just an average person. The subplot of a psychiatrist sleep expert was lazy writing since it added nothing to the story. They needed to ""study"" those who couldn't sleep by strapping them down and taking endless blood samples? Seems pretty thin. The story could have progressed without any of the military and medical nonsense - it really added nothing.Despite missing a plot entirely, the pacing was good and the intensity of the situation grew throughout. The encounters with others slipping into sleepless madness deserves the higher rating. The overtired confusion added to the ominous tone of the film.Lastly, the movie ended in a way many thrillers do, a tacked on homecoming for the lead characters. I really think Hollywood needs a Masterclass in ending stories. It's okay to let lead characters die, especially in this case where the mother clearly already had severe brain trauma. The film would have been better served with the balance of humanity eventually finding one another and starting a new world. Maybe budget didn't condone, or maybe the obvious wasn't considered.7.0/10 sheerly tor thrill of the journey.",Awake

We got to see how the government is handling it, although more on that would of been nice I feel they wouldn't have a small base for such an important person.Pacing felt a little slow, it was never boring but could of moved faster.Writing was alright, nothing amazing.And cinematography was not special at all, some scenes where tinge camera is below head height and the angles when the car sinked was bad, I couldn't tell what was really happening.",Awake

206,oldpaperpeddlers,Ok but something missing,5,13 June 2021,"Movie has an interesting premise but like Greenland, another ""disaster"" movie I watched recently, it's as if the writers imagined the film as sci-fi but hadn't a clue how to actually write a plot with science, so they threw a few crumbs in the plot to get it going then Awake turned into a road trip to nothing. The characters were unable to sleep but I didn't have any trouble....The movie is more about a former soldier/mom/recovering drug abuser and her vulnerabilities, which is generally fine, but like Greenland, Awake falls into one complication after the other in an attempt to get to safety / find a cure which, again is generally ok, but it should have had some science along the way to make it seem like a, well, sci-fi. In the beginning of the movie just after the accident the movie seemed to actually skip an important piece of information--where the characters become aware of the inability to sleep. Seems there would have been more buzz about that moment. Instead the movie jumps ahead like we're supposed to know that the world, except for two people, can't sleep and will go crazy and die. Well, nothing interesting (sciency) really happens from there. And the ending? What ending? It is a CHEAP shot by a writer to avoid a real ending. Go ahead and watch the film if you have nothing better to do just to check out that... ending. The little girl who couldn't sleep did a fine job acting. Gina Rodriguez is good a playing a vulnerable but tough mom who does a lot of sobbing like mom's are supposed to do. She's also good at playing characters who sound like they have asthma and no inhaler.Could have been a better movie. I wouldn't have paid money to see it (well I sorta did since I'm a Netflix sub).

But why are there at least 2 people who appear to have no problems sleeping? The answer: these people died, reset, got a ""fresh start"". Not much is explained about this but the allegory is there for the spiritual idea of being born again.Many of the church people are portrayed as crazy apart from the pastor who speaks of Jesus and His Sacrifice. He died and rose again, and because of that, we can live after death as well. The pastor also mentions being ""woke"" when trying to understand why no one can sleep saying maybe God wants them in such a state. It's interesting that the cure for such wokeness turns out to be being born again. The symbolism is complete in the end when the children ""baptize"" their mother in order to save her.I can appreciate this movie as I do see the parallels and make these connections.

Why did the one prisoner help them and what even was his relevance in the story and what actually happened to him? What caused the virus or whatever it was to happen?

When Netflix throws money at anyone willing to make a movie no matter how little experience they have, you end up with this movie. I wish I could get my money back from my subscription.

308,BluesMessiah87,So....yeah,3,11 June 2021,"A reminder that Netflix doesn't really MAKE these films, they just fund ideas. And it was a clever idea. Even the explanation for the phenomenon was at least semi-plausible without too much suspension of belief. But beyond that - not a single character stood out. Not a single relationship was believable. And the ending...
All that said, after reading some of the other reviews, I do feel the need to defend this flick a little because apparently a lot of people slept through the explanation and have drawn some pretty far out conclusions. No, this wasn't a metaphor for ""woke"" America, nor was it about religion. The explanation had to do with a specific event (mentioned in the film) causing our biological/neurological sleep system to go haywire. So rebooting the system does make some logical sense. What do you do to reset your computer - you shut it down and restart it. That's it. And for anyone saying it's unrealistic to believe that most people would not suffer dramatic psychological changes after 5 days of total sleep depravation. Research shows that after 72 hours paranoia, hallucinations, perceptual and emotional changes are common. And that's in individuals who believe it is them individually, not individuals suddenly living in a world where NOONE can sleep and nobody knows why. So I DO find how quickly society breaks down in this very believable, even with some of the crazier stuff that happens earlier on. In fact, those things were the most believable part of the movie.SPOILER ALERT:
Forget that somehow the one person who can sleep - the young daughter - just HAPPENED to be connected to the one place in the country with the military sleep expert to do the research to save the world. Let's forget that mom likely would have died from that defib mishap that reanimated the son. The final scene leaves us with the belief that the only 3 humans left to repopulate the Earth are Mother, brother, and sister. I guess it really is biblical.",Awake

313,masterbadger,"Interesting idea, shakey execution",5,15 June 2021,"A great concept wasted. The premise is simple, some cosmic event happens, and no one can sleep anymore. Well almost no one. Along with the unraveling of humanity we have the story of an estranged mother trying to save her children, one of whom is able to sleep. The film is competently shot and I found most of the performances adequate. Gina Rodriquez is solid enough, and I was happy to see Jennifer Jason Leigh, who unfortunately only has a minor role.The film really falls apart on the screenplay level. Mainly because there is almost no consistency in the scenario. Our main character already started 12-24 hours less sleep than most people, and she frankly never really seems to that much acuity. I mention this because there is almost no consistency with how people fall apart. One day without sleep and a law enforcement officer is willing to execute someone, and people are considering sacrificing a child. It just does not parse.While some reviewers found the film boring, I did not. I thought the scenario was interesting enough to see it through. When we are talking about consistency this really comes to a head at the end. We spend all of this time watching society and people unravel, it is all fairly dark. Have no worries though, NONE of our protagonists die, but even better they basically fall upon a solution that should have been discovered when the first person somewhere was revived.A missed opportunity sadly.

The situation and people make NO SENSE and both are poorly defined.The family has a life and death situation the first day that they just seem to shake off with no affect. Nobody at the scene seems to react to the situation. Ho hum. Shouldn't someone be talking about what just happened?Apparently after a night without sleep the world is in turmoil. People flock to church to deal with the crises. Characters show up at the main characters house half mad because they missed a night of sleep. Scientists are already packing up and heading to secret laboratories. However as a viewer it's moving so fast you simply don't care.Not one of the characters is really defined. Take for instance Barry Pepper who plays a minister who is introduced 2 minutes before a deep dramatic conversation with the daughter who can sleep. Who is he? Why do we care?

It was actually very good.I'm going to avoid any spoilers, and instead say that the premise of the movie is very interesting. Certainly the effects visited on the populace as a result of what took place are completely believable given the physiological realities and physical requirements of being human, even if there's no way of quantifying whether or not the actual mechanism that created the crisis is possible. But this is fictional, so how scientifically sound does it have to be? We live in an era with 388 foot tall radioactive dragons battling 300 foot tall gorillas that speak sign language in movies. Surely we can make room for one more promise that's out there?The acting was actually extremely good. Given what was happening, the emotions and emotional strength portrayed was spot on in my view. Unlike these witless zombie movies people keep flooding to see, this movie required some actual acting talent to pull off and everyone did well. I was particularly impressed with Arianna Greenblatt's performance. She portrayed a girl several years younger than herself and while it would have been an amazing performance coming from an 8 or 9 year old, even at 13 she really delivered in a movie portraying a situation that would completely terrify any child were they caught up in it.Ignore people claiming there was no action or that it moved too slow. It's like they watched a different movie. I would say it was paced pretty much the same way War of the Worlds was paced. You can't have pandemonium in every scene of a movie.

Oh forgot to mention on like day 1 or nearing day 2 the cop was so confused he murders a guy in a church, and people want to sacrifice the young girl like biblical times.She obtains a pistol from a crashed car and then proceeds to ""teach"" her daughter how to shoot in the library and after she says she is scared of guns, she fires off three precious rounds into the book stacks of the library.Oh you left your sleeping kid in the car while you and your son are inside a library - when the escaped convicts swarm around, and oh I forgot you left the keys in the car ... but must be sleep deprivation. Oh and of course - now she's out of ammo.It continually spirals down from there if that all wasn't bad enough.Please, unless you really LOVE films that use the ""let's frustrate the audience by having the lead make all the worst errors in judgment to create a false tension"" type films, I highly suggest you walk away from this one or at least make sure your neighbors can't hear you as you are screaming to the tv every five minutes when the heroine makes yet another ridiculous blunder.But yeah - that's because she's tired.",Awake

I've often gone around 36 hours, occasionally 48, casually without sleep though and been nothing like what the people in this movie did. Maybe you can put it down to the mass panic in addition to sleep deprivation? Indicators for which day we're on would have been useful, I was getting confused. A couple scenes were painfully slow. And the ending: didn't quite make sense, I thought at first that electrocution was the cure (I'm rubbish at predicting plots), then when it wasn't it didn't really make sense that they went all the way to the river, especially since they weren't sleep deprived? So no excuse really. I like the bit in these films too where they show the situation starting to be solved, which they didn't here - personal preference though I guess, just would have liked to see them try to cure others (though telling other people they need to die might not have gone over too well and that's why it wasn't included).But it was watchable, there's suspense and shock and sadness and heartfeltness and all that stuff.

The acting is average for a Netflix original, not what I would call good but not ""this is so awful I need to wash my eyes with bleach"" bad. They spend the entire movie showing people acting white girl drunk and 0 effort in progressing the storyline. I will admit, I have seen worse...but this is bad.

The scientists at the center focused only on how the body works which only leads to a dead end. They show less interest in how the mind works than just how the physical body works--interesting as it seems if the film intends to insinuate the naturalistic paradigm of science in finding solutions.

I blame A quiet place for this trend, and I thought birdbox would be the worst, I was wrong.Awakes' premise fails right from the get go. While stores about people fighting insomnia can be good.

Prisoners let out, well we can't let that take up screen time better move on. Teaching the child who can sleep to survive when we all die in 3 days? Nope, move on.This gets down the the biggest problem of the film though, the characters are just so stupid. Even taking into the account that they are all sleep deprived, they don't do anything logical in a survival situation. They just do whatever the plot needs to move on.I could go on and on about characters, but lets talk about that ending. So, we're all awake because of the sun and an electromagnetic burst. Yeah, no. That's stupid. As a concept it is just so boring. Like, there's nothing to overcome here. Nothing challenging to overcome and grow/learn as characters. This movie is literally about nothing. Except a mother never sleeps I guess? The whole thing of dying to restart your sleep cycle stuff is just such a cop out. It's the easiest way to just wave away the problem.

Characters were also poorly developed - some seems to take key roles at some moments - like the jail guy who saved the mother and the kids or the grandmother or the priest, but they just fade off from the story or die without much explanation.

So people start going crazy, because who doesn't want to sacrifice a child after 24 hrs without a nap?

479,beefudd,Reminds me of The Happening with a bit of religion.,2,17 August 2021,"I have to say the cinematic visuals were probably the best thing of the movie. Acting was ok with nothing worth remembering. Story had a good idea but lost its ending halfway through. As a sci-fi, apocalyptic suspense thriller I didn't see so much sci-fi or apocalyptic suspense. Some thrills was the most but not many. It really reminds me of The Happening in that it had a good idea but lost the ending along the way. People losing it and killing others and/or themselves without a reason. The Happening blamed it on the trees but blame being Awake by dying? Or (here's where religion comes in) you die and then are reborn again? So, if you have 90 minutes to spend watch it and see what it's about. You can go through life watching or not watching this film. I agree mostly with people that say the film had a good idea that got lost in the shuffle and those that gave it high reviews well maybe they are hallucinating a better movie for a reason!Side note to the ""error/goof"" in the movie where someone mentions that Matilda wasn't given cpr by the sheriff at the beginning on the movie.

The concept of the film is solid; most humans on the planet are unable to sleep and will die in a matter of days. Unfortunately the execution feels somewhat clunky. Like the writers didn't quite know how to flesh out their idea.Gina Rodriguez is believable as a struggling widow trying to reconnect with her 2 children. However, the rest of the cast seems to fall flat. Particularly Finn Jones, who's character serves no purpose other than explaining the science mumbo jumbo for the audience.The most captivating parts of the movies are the 2 action sequences that take place in cars. (You'll know them when you see them).

The movies run time is about and hour and a half and that rushes the plot a little too much. It is easy to misjudge the amount of time that passes in the film if you miss the dialogue at points.All in all it was a decent film even rushed and left me questioning what the event, that is only briefly eluded to in passing, caused all the chaos.

Somehow this film manages to be stupidly fast paced and ridiculously slow at the same time, a feat I've never seen in a film before. It could have been explained so simply with a small subtitle day 1, day 2 etc and it would have made more sense.People became bloodthirsty within hours, which made no sense at all. There are a lot of questions which are never answered:
The scene with the prisoners, explained as ""the guards came back and opened the doors"" why? It agains makes no sense, a simply and more plausible answer would have been ""the doors were electronically opened when the event happened. Done.Why did the one prisoner save them? Never explained. How did he suddenly reappear at the hub with the family having no idea where the family were? Never explained.Why was dodge seemingly able to function better than most? How did he die? Never answered.Now onto the massive plot hole...
I figured out the reason pretty much straight away, it was so obvious and yet no one in the film asked the basic question, what happened to the girl that hadn't happened to the others? A team of scientists never even asked. She died and was revived, simple.When the girl finally figures it out, why did they take the mom to the lake to drown her? Why not just put a pillow over her head right there and use the defibrillator? I'm guessing the director wanted to use water as a kind of ""baptism"" but why go down a religious route at the end after showing the religious people in the film to be nutters?Poorly written, poorly edited and poorly directed which is a real shame as the acting itself wasn't too bad.",Awake

The other characters were well written too. The plot was engaging.Sure, the secret of how the little girl was able to sleep was hinted at very early and confirmed by the old lady at the end, but why was that a bad thing? It let the audience in on something the characters didn't know and made me want to shout at them for not figuring it out sooner.Also, to those complaining that it ""wasn't explained"" what did you want them to say? Aliens? Biological warfare? The ambiguity was a feature, not a bug. Also, Dr. Murphy gave a half-explanation that made sense.It also did a good job reflecting society without pushing an agenda. Jill wanted her daughter to learn, Dodge wanted society to forget. Some of the church-goers were crazy but the pastor was like-able enough. There were good and bad prisoners, doctors, church-goers, police, soldiers, drug-dealers etc.Also, it wasn't too long for no reason, every shot was useful.Seriously, what else do you want from this movie?

500,jamiesaglover,A good film that leaves some unanswered questions,7,5 August 2021,"Good film, looking at how a lack of sleep might impact people but I felt the film could have expanded on some of the characters in more depth and that it also needed an extra last scene showing life a few weeks after the actions that took place at the end of film, just something to wrap things up rather than being left to imagine what happened.",Awake

502,vera-zvonareva,Great idea - Dreadful film.,4,10 June 2021,"Something strange happens and no one can sleep anymore. What a cool idea! But that was the only positive aspect of the movie.I've tried to find an explanation to everything while watching the movie and it eventually ended up abruptly without any explanation! I actually lost 100 minutes of my life. You can't come up with such an idea without explaining the cause of everything. The ending is extremely cheap too!Why can't people sleep? WHY? You'll never find the explanation and just for that, the film is not worth watching!",Awake
503,dfwcarol,"Exhilarating, well done storytelling",9,10 September 2021,"This is one of those films, one of those rare, uncut, raw gems that you find in the slew of rubble of entertainment options out there today.It's a fairly typical storyline, post apocalyptic catastrophe where the reluctant heroes suffer and struggle all the way through to find answers.It was just so well done, emotionally intelligent & powerful. I was wrought with tension and anxiety throughout the entire film. I tend to watch these sorts of films as a kind of how to, or how not to survive in extreme uncertain times, which seems to be more and more like a possibility these days. Figuratively and literally.These storytellers take us, the audience along on the journey just like we are one of the band picked up along the way. They allow us to feel the same emotions that the characters are experiencing and it is a very gratifying ride. This is truly a gift in filmmaking.Jill (Gina Rodriguez) leads the charge with fortitude and grace under pressure as her and everyone else's mental capacities wither away with terrifying consequences.We learn along the way that she may not have made the best choices in life up to now but she steps up to the plate very effectively whenever things hit the fan. She protects her children with a ferocity and elegance simultaneously all the while navigating the perilous landscape of collapsing society.Her children Noah & Matilda (Lucius Hoyos & Ariana Greenblatt) display typical behaviors of frightened children who grow bolder and kinder as the stakes rise. The emotional arc of these characters is eloquently portrayed by how they care for eachother, their mother and even strangers they encounter along the way.One stranger in particular, Dodge (Shamir Anderson) is introduced as a sterotypical potential threat who demonstrates strength and dignity in this journey through the increasingly dangerous world.It really is refreshing to see people of color in such a new dynamic light.Overall this film runs viewers through the emotional wringer and provides a satisfactory catharsis in its conclusion.",Awake

It is not boring move, with some good suspense but without a really content. The audience needs more information about the concept and why this kind of illness takes part it, that means that the plot was inadequate. The casting is ok and movies soundtracks/theme boost the suspense.BUT, I don't believe that it is a recommended movie even though it is a bit interesting, the end is quite awful.",Awake
507,eagleboyzflag,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,10 June 2021,I spent the whole movie taking the p*ss out of everything. The storyline was beyond stupid. There's never any explanation about why no one can sleep. How is it that after one night of no sleep people are already executing each other and church goers are willing to sacrifice a little girl because she can sleep.... Like wtf!? Somehow the male doctor seems to know everything about what's going on overnight and surmises that it's a worldwide event. How would you know that if communication systems are down?When they're at the library looking for a map the Mum just lets the daughter take off outside to sleep in the car despite all the lunatics that are roaming the streets and the fact they've got a working car. Great parent she is. She even tries teaching the daughter how to drive at night! If you were going to teach a child how to drive wouldn't you at least do it during the day time when it's easier to see your surroundings? I could go on forever. Dumbest movie I've seen in a long time.,Awake

Some minor flows are overweighted by interesting plot idea and excellent performance by Gina Rodriguez, other actors are pretty good too. Ending, although predictable, was creative - good way to conclude the story. All in all, breath of fresh air amongst plethora of SCI-FI flicks that rely on CGI rather than acting. I enjoyed watching it.",Awake

515,annikafronaeus,I almost didn't stay awake..,4,28 June 2021,"Unlike the audience the people in this movie can't fall asleep. Why is it happening? Some sort of asteroid hits earth. Jill, a woman with a tough past, is forced to protect her 2 kids with all means necessary while the world erupts into chaos. Her daughter however can sleep.It could have been so good, but unfortunately isn't. A lot of things happen haphazardly, the movie starts to loose focus and motivation halfway through. The solution to the problem in the movie isn't implemented enough and therefore it lacks credibility. When the movie ended, my reaction was ""Really? That's it?"" I wish they would have taken the time to establish characters and the plot more. But I guess it's more fun to just show people loosing their minds from being sleep deprived.",Awake

The story unfolds slowly. We do not have every information served on the plater. Cinematoraphy is very good. Lots of long shots and nice camera movement. People who are deprived of sleep do not act normal. When I was suffering from insomnia I was a different person. Your IQ level drops down. You can not focus. You make bad decisions and you are constatly tired. I think it is a goo premise for a movie. I would consider it one of the better netflix post apo movies. If you like something with good cinematography the watch it.,Awake

She knows her daughter is sleeping yet isn't curious about it until someone tells her about it... And her bike of course gets stolen. They protagonist is just too dumb.... Also why the religious element?
