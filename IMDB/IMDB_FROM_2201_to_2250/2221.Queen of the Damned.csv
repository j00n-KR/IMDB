0,Leofwine_draca,Execrable nonsense,1,31 August 2011,"Recently I sat through TWILIGHT, and I thought to myself that I'd never see a worse vampire movie. Then I watched QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. An adaptation of the Anne Rice novel and a follow up to 1994's well-remembered INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED updates the action to the present and recreates the vampire Lestat as a rock star. The film sees him crossing swords with an age-old vampire queen. That's about it.Everything about this movie smacks of self-indulgence. There were qualms over Tom Cruise's casting in INTERVIEW, but Stuart Townsend (who he?) is a million times worse. His Lestat is a character you want to beat mercilessly with an iron bar, he's so smug and supercilious. The supporting cast are diabolical, the plotting is straight out of a bad episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and I actually felt sorry for Paul McGann, so extraneous is he here.This movie wants to be so achingly hip and cool and the truth is that it's a ridiculous mess. A mix of trite dialogue, absurd and poorly filmed action scenes and a great deal of badly animated burning vampires straight out of the BLADE films. I was hoping for Wesley Snipes to come and kick some namby-pamby vampire ass, but sadly it wasn't to be. Watch out for the rock concert invaded by flying vampires, undoubtedly this awful movie's nadir.",Queen of the Damned
1,Prismark10,Lestat rocks,3,11 December 2016,"Whereas Neil Jordan's Interview with a Vampire was baroque, overlong and filled with 'A' listers or potential 'A' listers.Queen of the Damned on the other hand contains 'B' listers or those who never even reached those heady heights. It is a Goth Rock horror film. Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend) awakes from a long nap into a changed world and becomes a rock star as we enter the world of Goth clubs where he constantly gets attacked by other vampires.A paranormal librarian investigates this new rock singer believing him to be a vampire and an ancient Egyptian queen comes back to life, awaken by Lestat's music.The film is just poorly plotted and uninteresting. It lacks the budget and imagination Jordan brought to the first film and it really is sloppy seconds without any of the camp.",Queen of the Damned
2,mark.waltz,Meet the Dreckulas.,3,14 October 2021,"What's more delicious than seeing a bunch of idiotic rock groupies fawning over the self admitted vampire LeStadt, now a rock star, and getting the feel of the fang? This delightfully awful follow up to ""Interview of the Vampire"" goes 200 years past its conclusion and sets itself in modern day London in the world of rock music which is already filled with bloodsuckers, so it's an appropriate metaphor. Colorful and filled with non stop giggles (mostly unintentional), this unites Stuart Townsend's take on the handsome Mr. Toothy and introduces him to the royal majesty of toothiness, the alluring Ayilla.When LeStadt first makes his appearance to the rock band he shoots to stardom, it's obvious that it's best to view this from a camp perspective with some truly laughable line deliveries. There is a nice sense of romance among the eternally cursed but it's intermixed with some very bloody carnage. At times, it seems almost like a rock opera, but then slows down suddenly to a very slow pacing. So this is a film of several moods, never quite sure what it wants to be.Some fabulous sets will knock your eyes for a loop as well as the sound and special effects, and Ayilla gets a fabulous entrance. The action switches between the old days and modern times, yet the narrative is often all over the place and shows several inconsistencies with Anne Rice's most popular novel. The cast is far from impressive however, rather bland as a matter of fact when compared to the original. It's fortunately not as long.",Queen of the Damned
3,claudio_carvalho,The Return of Lestat,7,4 June 2017,"After a one-hundred year hibernation, the lonely Lestat (Stuart Townsend) awakes and decides to be a rock and roll star, exposing that he is a vampire. Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), who works at an organization that studies paranormal phenomena, investigates the vampires in London and finds their coven. The president of the organization David Talbot (Paul McGann) tells that they should only observe and lends to her Lestat's journal. Jesse learns how Lestat turned into a vampire by his maker Marius (Vincent Perez) and his first contact with the powerful Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), who is the first vampire. Jesse becomes obsessed for Lestat ad travels to Los Angeles, where he will give a concert with his band. Meanwhile vampires from every part of the world travel to the concert to kill Lestat. What will happen in Los Angeles?""Queen of the Damned"" proceeds with the return of Lestat but is not a sequel of ""Interview with the Vampire"". Lestat is different and less evil in this film and Stuart Townsend is witty and funny. The inexpressive Marguerite Moreau begins and ends with the same pointless face. But the music score is great and the special effects are top- notch for a 2002 film. The death of Aaliyah in 2001 in plane crash is the sad part of this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Rainha dos Condenados"" (""The Queen of the Damned"")",Queen of the Damned
4,nogodnomasters,"SEX, BLOOD, ROCK AND ROLL,",9,7 October 2018,"Vampire Lestat ( Stuart Townsend) takes a nap for a few hundred years because the 18th and 19th centuries were boring. Apparently life begins at a NIN concert. Lestat joins a band and somehow is instantly a success in an age before Simon Cowell (must be a chapter they skipped from the book). He openly claims to be a vampire to the dismay of vampires in hiding and taunts them, ""Come out come out whoever you are."" It didn't take long for him to pick up the modern accents and slang.There is a lot of loose talk of loneliness and ""the dark wasteland of eternity"" apparently a theme designed to appeal to the immortals among us, for some reason I failed to connect to it.Our title character (Aaliyah ) makes her first real appearance about halfway into the film. Catchy title, but it really was all about him and not her.The film is a modern erotic thriller without sex and nudity, something that most filmmakers can't accomplish.Now what if ""Concrete Blond"" was composed of vampires and they had a battle of the bands...I did not read the Anne Rice books, so I don't know how bad the adaptation was or wasn't.I enjoyed the music in the film more than the acting. Stuart was great in his role and I am still scratching my head at Aaliyah's accent. Was that was supposed to be ancient Egyptian or something? Sounded more Akkadian.Some f-bombs in music lyrics.",Queen of the Damned
5,jboothmillard,Queen of the Damned,2,12 October 2010,"I had an idea of the concept, and I knew it was meant to be rubbish, but I also knew the actress playing the title character died during or after making it, so I had to see it. Basically vampire Lestat De Lioncourt (Stuart Townsend) is woken from his slumber by the sound of rock music, and he plans to be a success in the industry, with everyone knowing what he is. Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) is a journalist looking into the paranormal and obviously Lestat in particular, specifically his lyrics and past. The past reveals Marius De Romanus (Vincent Perez) was the vampire who made Lestat a vampire himself, and he disappeared years ago, but has come back to warn him that he should not be exposing himself. There is a point in the past when Lestat discovered a secret door leading to the statues of Queen Akasha (singer Aaliyah) and the King, and in the more recent days he bit her. This leads to her waking up, and gains her powers back by biting the neck of the King statue, and she is now on the rampage killing vampires at random until she finds Lestat. It all leads to Lestat's big selling concert performing his material, and Queen Akasha shows up to create chaos, oh, and Jesse finds out that she is the daughter of a vampire. In the end most of the vampires team together to drain Queen Akasha until she turns into fire and ash, and the new Queen becomes a statue, and everything is back to normal. Also starring Withnail and I's Paul McGann as David Talbot, Lena Olin as Maharet, Christian Manon as Mael, Claudia Black as Pandora and Bruce Spence as Khayman. It is tragedy that Aaliyah died in a plane crash not long after completing the film, but it is also tragedy that her final performance is pretty terrible. So she only looks good in her metal plated bra, the rest of the cast are terrible, the special effects look slightly cheap, and it isn't a scary horror at all, a waste of time. Pretty poor!",Queen of the Damned
6,BA_Harrison,"Wow, what a massive step down from Interview With The Vampire.",4,20 May 2012,"Interview With The Vampire dealt with the anguish that goes hand in hand with becoming a vamp. In contrast, Queen Of The Damned panders to that goth/emo fantasy where it is really cool to be an immortal bloodsucker, likening it to the life of a rock star with millions of adoring fans. This approach mightn't be all that bad, if only Queen Of The Damned didn't do it all in such a lame and predictable manner.Stuart Townsend takes over the character of Lestat from Tom Cruise and delivers a weak central performance lacking the star power and charisma vital for the role; his pale boyish looks would certainly not earn him the respect of hardcore nu-metal fans. As ineffectual as Townsend's turn as Lestat is, however, it is nowhere near the worst thing about the film: the pacing is dreadfully slow, the dialogue is dreary, the direction lacks the sumptuous detail and elegance that Neil Jordan gave Interview, and the less said about Aaliyah's awful performance as Akasha the better (suffice to say that even the way she walked annoyed the hell out of me).",Queen of the Damned
7,paul_haakonsen,At least the vampires weren't sparkling...,5,21 May 2017,"""Queen of the Damned"" is a vampire movie that sort of have me divided into two camps. The first is that the movie is actually fun and entertaining enough, and it does have some nice aspects to it. The second is that ""Queen of the Damned"" is actually one of the corniest and most stereotypical of vampire movies out there.Now, I haven't read the book upon which this movie is based and sculpted, so how true the events and characters were to what Anne Rice constructed, I have no idea.The story in ""Queen of the Damned"" is about Lestat, a vampire coming out in the open and proclaiming himself a vampire to the world in conjunction with promoting his band. A ruse to call out the elder vampires.""Queen of the Damned"" is entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Campy and cheesy, certainly, but there still was something entertaining to it. However, the storyline was bordering on being ridiculous and did have some gaping plot holes here and there. And there is a frightful similarity between the Lestat and Jesse characters and the Edward and Bella from ""Twilight"". And that sort of was just ridiculous.It is the atmosphere of the movie that works out for the best, because there is sort of a gloomy goth-like atmosphere to the movie.""Queen of the Damned"" feels like a fan service movie through and through. And the movie never shook that mantle, and it wasn't particularly promoting the enjoyment of the movie.Stuart Townsend (playing Lestat) was really carrying this movie, and this was definitely his movie in every aspect. And while Aaliyah certainly was great in the villainous role (playing Queen Akasha), then it was hard to take her serious when she was moving. Vincent Perez (playing Marius) was also adding a lot of flavor to the movie, despite having a minor role also.This is an entertaining enough movie, but hardly a vampire movie that stands out as being memorable.",Queen of the Damned
8,Quinoa1984,Definitely below par vampire fodder,4,24 February 2002,"Queen of the Damned, the new vampire movie based on Anne Rice's novel (and part of her partially homosexual Vampire Chronicals), is a mess of movie, and a shame considering one of the few people who has talent in the movie (Aalyiah, who proved her talent in Romeo Must Die and from her record career) won't be able to make another.Here, the vampire Lestat (played last time by Tom Cruise, now by Stewart Townsend) arises from the grave and becomes a lead singer of a goth band which infuriates many of the secretive vampires of the night, but also arouses and also arises the queen vampire Akasha (Aalyiah, who by the way isn't in the film nearly as much as you'd think which is another shame and waste) who wants to make him the king of vampires.  This plot-line isn't helped much by a sub-plot involving a mortal who is entranced by a diary written by Lestat 200 years earlier and who now wants to know everything, at any cost.Not worth watching, even for die-hard KoRn and Jonathan Davis fans who want to hear his innovative and incredible score and songs (sense the sarcasm folks).  D",Queen of the Damned
9,Theo Robertson,Somewhat Silly,4,25 November 2003,"I`ve never read The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice but I do vaguely remember seeing INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE , of which QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is a sequel . Lestat is now played by Stuart Townsend instead of Tom Cruise and our vampire anti-hero decides to become a rock star . Doesn`t that premise sound slightly silly ? It does to me and it`s not helped by the way the characters in the story react to the idea that a rising rock star is indeed a vampire . If Marilyn Manson claimed to be a blood sucking vampire would he become an even bigger media sensation ? I don`t think so either . Having said that if Michael Jackson claimed the same thing that would explain a lot , like for example why he looks so pale and avoids sunlight . Oooppps better not go there guys As I said I`ve never read Anne Rice so I`ve no idea how it`s been adapted to screen but as you may expect from a tale about a rock star vampire there`s a bit too much MTV imagery involved . Stuart Townsend plays Lestat very well ( Though I doubt if he`d been successful as Aragorn - He`s a bit too young ) with the right amount of sexiness and camp . Unfortunately the rest of the cast are a bit too poe faced to make much of an impression especially former DOCTOR WHO Paul McGann . There`s another problem with the cast and that`s the minor "" British "" characters . As I was watching the movie I couldn`t help noticing that they didn`t have British accents , they had "" Strine "" accents , strine being the variant English accent that Australians speak . It wasn`t until I came to this page to write this review that I discovered that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is an American /Australian co-production and that most of the minor Brit characters are indeed played by Aussies
At the end of the day QUEEN OF THE DAMNED may appeal to horror / Lestat fans and MTV addicts but I found it a silly film that takes itself far too seriously at the same time",Queen of the Damned
10,preppy-3,Sometimes incoherent but fun,7,4 March 2002,"Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend) awakens from the dead and becomes a rock singer (don't ask).  He taunts other vampires to come out and unwittingly awakens Akasha, queen of the vampires.  She wants Lestat and, with him, rule the world...but the other vampires out there aren't happy with that.  And then there's a human girl, Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) in love with Lestat...The film really works.  It has two great scary moments--one when Lestat attacks and kills two girls and a fantastic, violent vampire vs. vampires at a Death Valley concert.  Great special effects, flashy camerawork (love how they show the vampires flying), some good acting but the plot has serious problems.  There's way too much for one movie and there are obvious cuts in the film (I'm guessing for time) that render the last section incomprehensible.  I was able to (sort of) follow it but it ruins what could have been a really great vampire film.Stuart Townsend looks good as Lestat (a definite improvement over Tom Cruise) but his acting is only so-so.  He doesn't hurt the film but he doesn't help either.  The late Aaliyah is very good as Akasha--she's sexy, slinky and scary.  There's a scene of her eating a still beating human heart that won't leave me.  However it's Vincent Perez who steals the movie as Marius (the vampire who ""made"" Lestat).  He's obviously enjoying himself and it shows.So, it's worth seeing--much better than ""Interview with the Vampire"".",Queen of the Damned
11,poolandrews,"I hate this film, give me Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee any time over this Hollywood crap.",1,31 January 2005,"Queen of the Damned opens with a tedious monologue by the Vampire Lestat De Lioncourt (Stuart Townsend) who basically says that he has been asleep for 200 years because he is lonely. However, it appears that the present day interests him enough to awake and forge a career as a rock star. He has become highly successful and openly admits he is a Vampire to the press, although nobody seems to actually believe him. He lives off the blood of female groupies that his Manager Roger (Tiriel Mora) picks up and brings him. A woman named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who works for 'Talamasca Center for Paranormal Studies, London', listens to some of Lestat's lyrics and is convinced that he is a real Vampire because he talks of a pub called the 'Admiral Arms' and various other silly things. Jesse's friend and colleague David Talbot (Paul McGann) says that the organisation knows of Lestat and are already onto him. David gives Jesse Lestat's journal to read which chronicles Lestat's life, how he was turned into a Vampire by Marius De Romanus (Vincent Perez) and how he first came across the Queen of all Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah) who was at the time some sort of weird statue. Jesse becomes obsessed with Lestat and heads to the 'Admiral Arms' in which she finds acts of Vampirism taking place. There she meets Lestat who lets her live. Lestat heads back to Los Angeles to prepare for a sell-out concert. Jesse follows him. It appears that most Vampires dislike Lestat for his high public profile, which is drawing unwanted attention to all Vampires and not just himself, and they want him dead. While in Los Angeles Lestat is contacted by Marius who he hasn't seen in nearly 200 years, he begins to fall for Jesse when they meet again and Akasha makes an appearance as she plans to wipe out the human race and rule the Earth with Lestat by her side as King and Queen! All this while trying to prepare for a big concert too! Will the Vampires successfully assassinate Lestat? Will Akasha wipe out the entire human race? Will Lestat turn Jesse into a Vampire and condemn her to eternal life as a blood-sucking Vampire? Who cares? Directed by Micheal Rymer I hated this film. This film isn't horror as far as I'm concerned. It's as much horror as a music video. The script by Scott Abbott and Micheal Petroni based on the Novels 'The Vampire Chronicles' by Anne Rice is an absolute mess. It tries to have various story lines going but forgets about them during the film, it also fails to juggle the various sub-plots so that I cared about or even remembered them. The flash back to Lestat's early years is almost redundant, Akasha's plan to take over the world isn't even mentioned until the last half an hour or so, Jesse at first is trying to track Lestat down as part of her job but that is also quickly ditched as she becomes the love interest, Lestat as a rock star is only really focused on during two scenes, there's a scene where Lestat and Akasha fly to an island and well, I'm not really sure as it's so choppy as to be almost incoherent and generally speaking there just isn't a single focused story going on. There is a typical Hollywood 'happy ending' that almost made me sick. It's really slow and boring too. There's no blood, gore, violence or Vampire action except a ripped out heart a bloodless decapitation and a couple of Vampire fights with awful CGI effects that are simply embarrassing to watch. Having said that I did like the way Akasha died, but it only lasts for about a minute so doesn't compensate for the lack of any decent horror throughout the rest of the film. The acting is poor and no one looks particularly interested, Aaliyah stands out as being as rotten and miscast as anyone else and she looks like she should still be in school! It's quite well made but for a film with a budget this big that's the least I expect. Just to round this terrible film of and add insult to injury is the soundtrack which features mind numbingly bad rock tracks throughout. I hate this film. Avoid if at all possible, you'll be glad you did.",Queen of the Damned
12,zardoz-13,Offers Something New for Audiences,7,11 July 2007,"Long on lore but short on gore, director Michael Rymer's new horror chiller ""Queen of the Damned,"" starring Stuart Townsend as the Vampire Lestat and late R&B crooner Aaliyah as the diabolical dame, qualifies as a campy, vampy transfusion of fun. Unlike its pretentious predecessor, director Neil Jordan's uneven but atmospheric ""Interview With A Vampire"" (1994), ""Queen"" doesn't meander around with morbid melodramatics. Instead, this lightweight but entertaining epic about immortal bloodsuckers on the prowl isn't so much a straight-line sequel as an autonomous adaptation of Anne Rice's ""The Vampire Chronicles."" Actually, ""Queen"" shares more in common with Stephen Norrington's bloodthirsty ""Blade"" (1998) with its accent on heretical hemoglobin hunters who refuse to abide by Dracula's discretionary daylight dictates. Like the nefarious Nosferatus in ""Blade,"" the creepiest of the cryptmeisters in ""Queen"" not only wants to come out of the coffin forever but also dine on humans until doomsday. Anybody who saw ""Interview"" knows Lestat (Tom Cruise) emerged as the world's fiercest fangster. Thoroughly evil, he lacked a single redeeming feature. In ""Queen,"" Australian director Michael Rymer and scenarists Scott Abbott & Michael Petroni have reimagined the lecherous Lestat, so he appears comparably saintly, more like Brad Pitt's bloodsucker in ""Interview."" As the action unfolds, Lestat has been mildewing in his mausoleum for 200 years, because he found immortality by himself a colossal bore. We learn in ""Queen,"" for instance, that a 400-year-old vampire called Marius (Vincent Perez of ""The Crow 2: City of Angels"") kidnapped Lestat and turned the 18th century French nobleman into a vampire. Vampires amount to a gregarious group in this big screen incarnation. Like the rebellious young Kirsten Dunst character in ""Interview,"" Lestat ventures where he shouldn't have and takes a forbidden bite out of Akasha, the Queen of all vampires. Marius had Akasha's petrified corpse locked up for all eternity in the cellar of his magnificent castle. Anyway, Marius vanishes with Akasha, leaving poor Lestat to fend for himself. Depressed, Lestat retires to his crypt, until the melodic strains of rock'n roll serenade him back to the 'live' side. Exposing himself to the world-at-large as a real-life vampire, Lestat forms his own heavy metal band and gets his picture on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Principally, his fellow fangsters hate him, because he revealed their secret existence. Meanwhile, a British babe named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who serves as an apprentice for a cloistered clique called the Talamascans, paranormal people who keep tabs on vampires but refuse to interfere with them, wants to meet Lestat. She heard one of his hit tunes, and it turned her on! Jesse's mentor David Talbot (Paul McGann, a one-time ""Dr. Who"") warns her to leave well enough alone, as does her distant vampire auntie Maharet (Lena Olin). Of course, Jesse listens to neither and runs afoul of the evil Akasha.Like the best vampire outings, ""Queen of the Damned"" never takes itself seriously, offers something new for audiences, and climaxes with an exciting, slam-bang, action-packed finale.",Queen of the Damned
13,Calicodreamin,Sexy.,6,10 December 2019,"This whole movie gives off an incredibly sexy vibe from the music to the vampires to the cinematography. Undeniably rich in chemistry. The actual plot is a bit muddled, but it's not core to what makes this movie and interesting watch.",Queen of the Damned

Who will be the first to reach him and Who shall win the final battle of the vampires and survive.......There are some films that never need a sequel, despite the fact hat the first was based on a best selling collection. Interview With A Vampire was a phenomenal movie, and changed the way the vampire movie was imagined for a few years.It was classy, sultry, and Cruise conquered the screen as Lestat.So eight years later, this movie was as welcome as a hole in the head, and was just a blatant cash in for those good ol' greedy folk at Warner Bros'I haven't read the scourge material, and forgive me if I'm wrong, but who in the right mind would bring back a very sinister signature character, and have him try to conquer his race by becoming a Rock Star. In the hands of Rea, its possible that it could have been something, and he may have coaxed Cruise back in the title role, but no, we get an out of his depth Townsend trying to emulate the panache cruise had with ease eight years prior.And despite his best efforts, it's no surprises that he fails, and the fact he is carrying the film only adds insult, the audience know he isn't Cruise, so detach away from him.And I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but Aaliyah is awful in her role, and spends her screen time movie really strangely and hissing her lines.It's a worthless sequel, most of the cast know this, and I feel sorry for Townsend, he's a decent actor otherwise.",Queen of the Damned
16,mm-39,New Wave and stylish.,4,25 February 2002,"This film reminds me of the early 80's New Wave infusion.  One can see how Punk evolved into 2 high breds of Heavy Metal and New Wave.  This film reminds me of the '83 film ""The Hunger"" with David Bowie.  It has the grainy, blue light film quality with most of it being filmed in the dark. The synthesizer music and the character Marius looks like the singer of Human league; dresses simular to the guy in the video.  The cool Lt Cosello (Miami vice) acting style is done in true 80's fashion.  The concert, with the flames in it, reminded me of Blade Runner.  A lot of style, but all vampire films become redundant. I give it an 8 for style, and originality a 4.  If I was younger, say 14, I would give this an 8, but as I march into my 30's I give it a 4 or 5 because second time around I seen this before.",Queen of the Damned
17,whpratt1,A Cool Vamp,5,13 July 2006,"Enjoyed this vampire film because Lestat De Lioncourt,(Stuart Townsend),""Head in the Clouds"",'04, portrays a vampire who finds acceptance in a tattooed pierced black-clad world and is a modern day rock star and does not want to hide in the shadows or even in any darkest if he can help doing so. Aaliyah,(Queen Akasha),""Music of the Heart"",'99, plays the starring role as an old ancient Queen who is charmed by Lestat's bite on the hand and his sweet tasting blood. There is plenty of blood sucking and lots of french blood kisses going on constantly and all the hickeys a girl or guy could possibly give each other. Aaliyah, put her complete body and soul into this role and had a charm about her that I have never seen; it is a horrible shame that an airplane crash took her to the bigger Screen in the Clouds. Great modern day vampire film.",Queen of the Damned
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It's no Interview, but still a good vampire flick",8,24 February 2002,"I honestly did like ""Queen of the Damned"", despite it going on more of a MTV twist and not being faithful to the novels, come on. It was just a good movie for horror fans. I felt that it had good ideas and worked pretty well. With some new coming actors and a sexy performance of Aaliyah, the film really couldn't go wrong.We have a new Lestat, Stewart Townsend, who is just now starting to be more noticed from his last film with Kate Hudsen ""About Adam"". A lot of people were disappointed that Tom Cruise did not reprise his role, but to be honest as much as Tom did a great job, he couldn't have fit this time into the Rock -N- Roll Lestat. Stewart captured that sexiness and that sleek look of cockiness that was just perfect. All though yes, I didn't really like the romantic side the director took on him, he's still one of our favorite vampires.Aaliyah, no, she didn't have the look of Akasha, Queen of all that is damned. But she did a good job and was so incredibly beautiful. Her tragic death had just happened before they released ""Queen of the Damend"" into theaters, RIP! This movie captured her beauty and talent very well. She was so sleek and just sexy during her dancing scene in the pub with the other vamps before her massacre.There was one very bothersome actress, the one who played Jesse. She did so badly! Her lines, were, she just... gah! She was horrible, you'll have to trust me on that. Otherwise, I think you'll enjoy it, please! Don't compare the book, I like to say to people that if you want the book, read the book. This is a movie and it's not always going to be faithful, it just wanted a hipper look for a younger audience. Yes, of course the books are better, but if you're just looking for a fun horror flick, I'd recommend.8/10",Queen of the Damned

I liked Cruise's Lestat quite a bit!!! Stuart Townsend is not a good replacement Tom Cruise as Lestat. The story of this film stinks. Nothing ""stunning"" about this film to me - and it's worse than I remembered it to be (I just tried re-watching this film).I never have read the novel and I don't think I would like it - having Lestat as a rock star? No thanks - I prefer Lestat as he was in ""Interview With A Vampire"" from the film (I've never read that book either).I'm sorry but I really did try to watch this film again - and I really didn't like the film each time I've attempted to watch it.1/10",Queen of the Damned

Everyone loved that. It was a hit! Unfortunately, 'Queen of the Damned' is only a sequel as it's using some of the same characters (characters, not actors – there's a difference) and set in the same universe, so to speak. Basically, it's not really a sequel. It's another vampire story written by Anne Rice following some of the characters who you might have seen before. Don't expect to see Tom or Brad in this one.However, just because it doesn't really follow on, doesn't make it a bad thing – a disjointed thing, but not a bad thing. But, in some ways, it's not really the film's fault. It's about a vampire who has got disillusioned with drinking people's blood over the centuries and has gone to sleep for hundreds of years. Now he's woken in the modern age and decided to 'out' all the other vampires and their blood-sucking ways. It goes without saying that the rest of the vamps don't take kindly to his outspoken ways and decide to take him out. So where does the Queen come into it? She doesn't. That much. Unfortunately she's only in it for two scenes because the young actress playing her tragically died while the film was being made, leaving the story lacking what should have been a big part of its central element.Plus it doesn't really do the book justice. I haven't read the book. I'm one of the many who just watches the film, but I've generally browsed through enough internet message boards to realise that a lot of die-hard fans of the source material didn't appreciate the transition to film.So, it's got its fair amount of negative points. And yet it's actually quite good. Not great, but somehow highly watchable (if you're into vampires in general). It should all be quite campy and yet Stuart Townsend plays the lead vamp pretty well and is actually fun to watch. Aaliyah, for the few scenes she's in, sizzles as the Queen of the undead. It would have been pretty good if she'd have been able to show what she can do all the way through the film.It's probably not a film you're going to want to see again and again, but if you're not totally bored with vampires after binge-watching box sets of 'True Blood' then take a look at vampires rocking out on stage and fighting each other in the chorus.",Queen of the Damned
22,Irishchatter,It needed to be better honestly!,4,22 December 2016,"As a vampire fan, I was really disappointed by this because it would've been so brilliant if they didn't make a mock up of the story. By seeing the other actors including Aaliyah looking particularly confused on what their characters were suppose to do, this made the whole film flop. Not to mention, the storyline involving the female version of Dracula seducing what should've been Tom Cruises character Lestat, didn't give the whole story a chance. Maybe if it was just about the Vampire queen and she falls in love with a human woman or man, it would've been 10 times better! Although it would be a copycat of Dracula, but in my opinion, it could work out that way and have the film become successful!I really wish I have given this 10 stars but it just left me displeased with it unfortunately so thats why Im giving it 4 stars. Again, it honestly needed to be better!",Queen of the Damned
23,The-Sarkologist,"The music is pretty good, but that is about it.",5,29 December 2012,"This movie is actually based on the next two books of the Vampire Chronicles, The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. It seems as if quite a lot of people didn't really like this movie and I suspect one of the reasons that this was the case was because they changed the lead actor, but then again I did find Townsend preferable to Cruise. Plotwise, well I doubt that it could be much of an improvement on the first one, which did not seem to have a plot either, but also this movie is basically compressing two books into one so the plot was always going to suffer.Basically Lestat has been asleep for about a hundred years (since the end of the last movie) and has recently awakened to discover a new world, however he is still alone, so he decides to join a rock band and openly display the fact that he is a vampire, not that he would be considered a freak considering that he is moving about in the Gothic world of the 1990s.Then there is a young woman whose auntie turns out to be a vampire as well, and she has some special telekinetic powers that enables her to, well, I'm not exactly sure what, but she seems to be torn between becoming a vampire and not becoming a vampire. She is also a part of a secret society that monitors and records the paranormal activities, which includes vampires.We learn about Lestat's past, and that he stumbled across the statue (but is it really a statue) of the prime vampire known as the Queen of the Damned, and he also discovers that music has a tendency to awaken her, which is probably why he started a rock band (or at least joined one) because he did know that music awakens her, and what better way to summon her than through Gothic rock music.To me this was an okay movie, but the thing that I did really like about it was the sound track. One does wonder if a sound track really does make the movie. I guess it can make a bad movie bearable, but then again so does a short length. In the end though, I have seen this movie once and am unlikely to watch it again.",Queen of the Damned

25,filipemanuelneto,They killed Rice's books!,1,30 August 2015,"This film tried to be an adaptation of two Anne Rice's books that portrayed the life of Lestat, the vampire. Thus, the film shows his birth to the world of vampires and his connection with the vampire queen Akasha, who awakens from a secular sleep.It is, in theory, the continuation of the movie ""Interview with the Vampire"", although there is no connection between these two productions (remember that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt starred in these film, which was a huge success). So, who expects ""Queen of the Damned"" will also be great is going to have a big disappointment. In fact, it's the worst vampire movies I've ever seen, sacrificing the dramatic and psychological depth of the characters in favor of a pop-rock approach of the vampire world, which seems to have been thought to sell the film to the teen audiences and not to make it better.Directed by Michael Rymer, this film has an unfortunate and shameful script by Scott Abbott and stars the singer Aaliyah (deceased shortly after the shootings) and Stuart Townsend in the lead roles. Despite this stars, the film goes from the grotesque to the comic, depicting the teenagers like a bunch of mentally retarded with serious identity affirmation problems. Ah, of course: if you read Rice's books, forget them. This movie failed to portray the books or his essence. Basically, it's a different story whit characters with the same names of the Rice's books.

It is a horrible adaptation of the book. Terrible casting, terrible direction, terrible script. The movie is with out hesitation, one of the worst book to movie productions I've ever seen.While the Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise movie, Interview with the Vampire is good, it wasn't perfect either and they took plenty of creative license to produce it. However, the emotion and the feeling projected was satisfying and entertaining. This movie, Queen of the Damned, is nothing more than a bunch of people getting together and making a hipster movie.I dislike hipsters. They are into fads. That's why this movie fails. It is filled with fads rather than common sense. The original story was abandoned to make a hipster movie of passing fads.The casting is terrible. Lestat seems like a hipster rocker wanting attention. Lestat wasn't like that at all. He was confident and powerful. The Lestat in this movie is boring, weak and lacking any confidence.What a waste.",Queen of the Damned

That is literally ALL there is positive to say about this.What the heck happened? ""Queen of the Damned"" read like a comic book, it was one of the few things Anne Rice has ever written too over-worked to be enjoyable.Compared to ""Interview with the Vampire,"" it was an action packed romp. Compared to ""Memnoch the Devil"" it was Shakespeare...how the heck did they turn it into crap? They upped the vomit inducing cheese for starters. The introduction between Lestat and the band was, well, I really don't know how else to put it but ""disgustingly fantastical"" is the only thing I can think of.Wait...there is a better way to review this.I'm an audiophile among my many material fetishes. Audiophile, bibliophile, cinephile. As such I can be comfortable and enjoy metal as much as I can punk, rock, jazz, whatever.And I know more than a few PhD.'s that head bang along to System of a Down.This movie is NOT made for them.Instead it's the wet dream made for the people who listen to metal, think they are the toughest kung-fu ninjas on the planet, and breath through their mouths.You know the type, the people that think Metallica wrote ""Turn the Page.""

I mean, this story even featured a scrawny, effeminate blood-sucker named Lestat who (get this!) posed as a darling, little ""Romeo"" and a no-talent pop-music idol.And, believe me, this snivelling twinkie's stage presence, the songs that he sang, and the band who backed him up, all made me totally cringe with absolute revulsion like I never thought possible.All-in-all - This was yet another one of those boring, predictable, and easily-forgettable vampire movies that clearly tried to pass itself off as being so cool and hip - But, in reality, it was just pure vampire-asininity, on all counts.....

31,slayrrr666,Barely better sequel to a rather decent original,7,14 August 2008,"""Queen of the Damned"" is a decent sequel in it's own right to a decent original.**SPOILERS**Arriving in London, Lestat de Lioncourt, (Stuart Townsend) uses his musical group to force out long-dead vampires from their resting place. Due to the occasion, paranormal researcher Jessica Reeves, (Marguerite Moreau) begins to see that his lyrics on based on occult history about vampires, indicating he really is a vampire. Going into his past, she learns of the connection he had with Marius de Romanus, (Vincent Perez) the vampire who created him, and with Queen Akasha, (Aaliyah) a vampire queen who rules over the breed. Realizing that his music has forced her resurrection and unleashed a torrent of death and destruction, she races to make him understand what's going on before she gets to him.The Good News: This was a lot better than expected. In general practice, the last half of this one is it's best scenes, since it's got all the action scenes in the film. All of them are quite enjoyable as well, which makes for just as much fun. The concert scene here is the absolute best part here, taking up a rather significant portion of time to a fun concept, as there is specific songs that go through and once the vampires get involved up on-stage, it turns into a great action scene where, using the surroundings and wire-fu, manages to defeat the in front of the crowd who feels that they're merely putting on an act. Once the fire reigns down, it just cements the fun. The bar sequence, immediately after the resurrection is also really good since the fire gag makes it incredibly entertaining and just fun, as is the initial resurrection sequence. In the beautifully Gothic basement, complete with stone statues in a great setting, the musical keys for the resurrection are great and the clues that it's happened, in the form of a great series of really nice shock images in rapid-fire sequences, allowing for some wonderful moments and making it feel really creepy. The finale is excellent as well, as there's also the nicely erotic, but non-nudity bath sequence also make this fun. That it also does a nice job with the back-story of the lead vampire, especially in the montage throughout art history coming off the best, make it effective and nicely done. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this. One of the biggest issues is really just the fact that the vampire isn't very threatening. Remove the vampire aspect from any of these creatures and they become whiny Goth people who do nothing but mourn and whine all film long, either about the betrayal of vampire lore, lost loves or about finding out the past. It really makers them seem like complete weaklings rather than creatures which command fear. The fact that it's the major leads in this who do that are all the more reason to be apprehensive about it, as they're the ones spending the most amount of time and are just completely not that exciting or interesting. The brooding Goth doesn't make for good threatening vampires, and this one proves it. The other real flaw to this is the lack of blood and gore. This one has a rather healthy body count, gets a couple of really brutal deaths and some wonderful set-ups for gore, but nothing else about this really stands out because of the fact that it's just not bloody. The opportunity is there, but we get nothing more than neck bites for the majority of the kills, which isn't all that gory. A little more variety for these would've helped out tremendously. Overall, these are the film's problems.The Final Verdict: Not nearly as terrible as imagined but with a couple of incredibly damaging flaws, this one barely manages to become watchable at worst. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the first one or the book series, in the mood for a mainstream vampire take or plain interested, otherwise heed caution on it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language",Queen of the Damned
32,Lady_Targaryen,Anne Rice should be ashamed of this movie,4,13 June 2006,"''Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that I already saw. The only thing that I like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides that.( Since I am a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X)There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how to start. So many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favorite)Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to mention a few.(The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of ''The Vampire Lestat'', because it is the second book after ''The interview with the vampire'',and not ''Queen of Damned''. They tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles.So many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie. It is Pandora's case, for example.The actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, specially Marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful,tall,imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's maker to be Marius instead of Magnus as well.''Interview with the vampire'' was an awesome movie, I loved the actors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior then Stuart Townsend.(I am sad that Tom Cruise declined the chance of playing Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras as Armand didn't match with Armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' The Queen of Damned''.Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production.",Queen of the Damned
33,Terryfan,The Mother of all vampires,8,16 May 2015,"Before I review Queen Of The Damned I want to make something for the record to be clear, I never read any of Anne Rice's books that this film is based off.So that could explain why I did enjoy this film if I had read the book before viewing the film I might have felt differently however again I'm one of those movie fans who looks past the junk and see the treasure and if you watch this film with a open mind you might find some good to it while it isn't a classic it still enjoyable to me.The film plot centers around Lestat (Stuart Townsend) who has awaken for the first time in years to begin his raise as a rock star. Along his journey he meets Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) who after getting a hold of his journal from David Talbot (Paul McGann) begins to become curious about Lestat begins to look for him only for him to find her. However he is unaware that he is about to awake the mother of all vampires Akasha (Aaliyah) with his music and wants to bring hell to Earth.Also the film takes us to where Lestat becomes a vampire thanks to Marius (Vincent Perez) as he begins to teach Lestat about the life of a vampire. Queen Of The Damned actually took plots from ""The Vampire Lestat"" And ""Queen Of The Damned"". And This was Aaliyah's last film before her death and it's sad that we didn't see her much in the film but the scenes she took part in she really shine as the antagonist. Akasha was pure evil with no compassion for life. She ranks up there as one of the most evil villains I have seen and in my opinion of the best things about this film.Lestat being played by Townsend I actually enjoy his performance better as the anti-hero, plus Marguerite's performance as Jesse made it interesting for her.The movie best feature is the soundtrack which I remember buying in 2002 before I saw the film, the soundtrack is one of my most favorite movie soundtracks with my favorite song begin ""Forsaken"" sung by David Draiman of Disturbed which I felt set the tone and story of the movie. Jonathan Davis wrote a superb score for the film and the songs he did for the film really help tell the story of Queen of the Damned. That's why I love this film is for the soundtrack which is enough to watch the filmThis is one of my favorite vampire movies and it still showcase what a vampire film is suppose to beSo what if this is not the best film in the world it's still a good film to me the soundtrack is superb I give Queen Of The Damned an 8 out of 10",Queen of the Damned
34,PatrynXX,Kept wondering when Aaliyah was going to show herself.,5,20 October 2002,"(Spoilers)I understand the hoopla surrounding Aaliyah's last movie.  But I think much of it is overkill.  Since she only has about 15 minutes of showtime in the 105 minutes given.  It's of course mostly about Lestat and his new girl. Aaliyah's character is a total flake.  We don't even get her true voice in this movie.  Another point, if you liked Interview with a Vampire  (I didn't when I watched it, but that was 94, now 8 years later maybe I've changed) you probably won't see much connection between the two movies.  In the first movie I came to hate Lestat.  In it's sequel, he's supposed to be the hero. That and now it's about Vampires who grew up watching The Crow.  Even Vincent Perez (Crow 2) is in it.  What can I say?  Unoriginal?Watching Aaliyah's character get hers was pretty much totally lame.  No tension whatsoever.  Boring?  (Anyone screaming in the theater needs a head check)The casting of Lestat was totally off base.  To go from Tom Cruise to this nut?  Couldn't they of picked someone a little older?  A 200 year sleep certainly can't make a vampire look younger can it?Still, this movie beside itself is better than a few vampire movies I know.

35,sarastro7,Thoroughly enjoyable - really!,8,19 November 2004,"All right - let's go through the issues. The first movie, Interview With The Vampire, wasn't bad. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was slick, well-produced, highly dramatic - in parts even unsettling -, and featured what in my opinion is Tom Cruise's only truly charismatic role ever (as you can gather, I'm no fan of his). Kirsten Dunst's child vampire was very cool, possibly her best role ever (generally, I'm not a terribly big fan of her, either). All in all, an effectively entertaining movie. I rated it a 7 out of 10.Next I should mention that I'm not a fan, or reader, of Anne Rice, or of vampires generally. I just see the movies. But I hear things, and it was quite plain in the first movie that a number of rather significant liberties had been taken with the original story. The problem with that wasn't that it was done, but that it showed. While very well-produced, Interview With The Vampire was an obviously glossed-over version of the book, with many of the basic ideas and situations changed from the kind of clever ideas you see in a decently-written book and into the kind of rather less clever ideas you see in a typical mainstream Hollywood movie. The first movie, put simply, tried too hard to be mainstream. In my judgment, the second movie - Queen of the Damned - didn't make that mistake. Sure, there are changes in the story, but the thing is, it doesn't show. If you haven't read the books, Queen of the Damned works very well as an independent entity. And what's more, it preserves the feel of the books' ideas and situations extremely well. There's so much in this movie that is obviously taken directly from the books, because it's just that kind of clever scenes. This is not just fancypants Hollywood producers taking an original story and warping it into some soulless commercial sludge. This movie, despite the changes, shows respect to the original work, retaining much of its mood and atmosphere. How can I say this without having read the books? I dunno. It just feels that way, very strongly, when I watch it. I'm certain it's the case. The whole feel of the movie came across as thoroughly literary.I had heard, of course, that this movie was going to be bad, but the fact is that, quite surprisingly, I was thoroughly entertained by Queen of the Damned. Good story, cool acting, fun vampire action. It captivated me all the way through, and I even liked the ending. I'm not an Aaliyah fan, and while her acting in this movie technically wasn't very good, her character was still megacool, and she made a great ""supervillain"". Maguerite Moreau also needs special mention. She is indeed stunningly attractive, and one thirsts for more material with her after having seen this.Ultimately, Queen of the Damned was a good movie. Not a great masterpiece, but an honest, coherent romp of an adventure, with some great ideas and generally good performances. As with the previous movie, I rate it a 7 out of 10, but it is a bigger 7 (which I have since raised to an 8). The first movie was melodramatic and too Hollywoodized; two shortcomings that the sequel did not have, which makes it more watchable. Furthermore, Queen of the Damned managed to use the entire goth subculture, and its stylistic similarities to the vampire concepts, so well that I became engrossed in a kind of culture - and music! - that I've never had any interest in before. That's quite an achievement!!I salute the producers of Queen of the Damned.Finally, I have to mention another cool vampire movie I watched recently: The Twins Effect. It's a Hong Kong produced vampire comedy, superbly well-produced and uproariously enjoyable. Better than either of these Rice products. See it.",Queen of the Damned
36,mentalcritic,What a pile of @#!*,1,21 February 2002,"I was unlucky enough to catch this film on a bootleg VCD (I will never pay good money to see films in which African Americans verbally masturbate), and I still felt ripped off. Although I have fully outgrown Anne Rice's shallow, meaningless, and dull vampires, I still felt that her work deserved better than this.Apparently, the filmmakers turned down her offer to pen the script for nothing. They should have been begging her to write a script for them! Not only does this film miss what little point the novel had, it also glosses entirely over everything that makes the characters what they are.While I am on the subject, what the hell is up with the casting directors? An afro (c)rap star as the queen of Egypt? What the *&!%? But wait, it gets worse! They cast a tall, gaunt New Zealander as her *African manservant*. Yeah, you heard me right. How ironic that, in the year that the second part of a highly faithful adaptation of one of the greatest books ever written is due out, they should peddle this unfaithful rendition of a trendy hack's work.

38,jhclues,One You Can Sink Your Teeth Into,7,27 February 2002,"If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience.  A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `Queen of the Damned,' directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.	The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate.  What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome.  And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms.  Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known.  He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.	Lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' Lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert.  And they are not going for the music.  But there is something else, as well:  At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the `Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King:  Lestat.  And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be in attendance, without fail.	Make no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `Interview With the Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker's Dracula.'  He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect.  In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff.  There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern.  It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.	In `Interview With the Vampire,' Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly.  He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing.  It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.	As Marius, Vincent Perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good.  	Turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are Marguerite Moreau, as Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha.	And as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence.  What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty.  And, tragically, she has left us much too soon.	The supporting cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy).  With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans, especially, will be pleased with `Queen of the Damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast.  By focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same.

But what grandeur!!,7,10 June 2005,"QUEEN OF THE DAMNED Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSAt the end of the 20th century, the vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend) rises from his undead slumber and adopts the guise of a rock star, which draws the attention of a beautiful vampiress (Aaliyah) who wants to conquer the world...Forsaking the introspective melancholy of its highbrow predecessor (INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES), this ill-conceived sequel plays like a Gothic MTV fantasy with delusions of grandeur. But what grandeur! Combining elements from two of Anne Rice's celebrated 'Vampire Chronicles' ('The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned'), the narrative is anchored by Townsend's ultra-sexy turn as anti-hero Lestat. Flamboyant without ever seeming camp, he strikes a more dynamic figure than Tom Cruise's foppish blade in the previous film, and it's all too appropriate that he should locate himself within the modern music industry, with its outlandish characters and overzealous visual style (several of Lestat's music videos - inspired by German expressionist cinema of the 1920's - are convincing down to the last detail). However, while most of the songs - co-written by Richard Gibbs and KoRn vocalist Jonathan Davis - encapsulate the spirit of Lestat's heartbroken worldview, their aggressive fatalism will alienate some viewers and date the movie pretty quickly.As in the original, director Michael Rymer (IN TOO DEEP) downplays the homoerotic undercurrent which forms a significant aspect of Rice's literary style. Nevertheless, the script - written by Scott Abbott (INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE) and Michael Petroni (THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) - actively celebrates the 'outsider' lifestyle (vampires, Goths, rock fans, members of secret societies, etc.) and tips a knowing wink to the initiated when Lestat exhorts his fellow vampires to: ""Come out, come out, wherever you are!"" Aaliyah makes the most of her extended cameo as the Queen of the Damned - she even manages to steal some of Townsend's erotic thunder! - and her final sequence includes one of the most visually stunning vampire disintegrations ever captured on film. Sadly, the singer-actress died in a plane crash shortly after completion of principal photography.

He is perfect to play an attention seeking bloodsucker and was surprisingly good in the Interview.

45,Antagonisten,Weak,3,16 January 2005,"Vampire movies are a genre filled with many absolutely detestable movies. Sometimes a miracle happens and a Vampire movie can be very entertaining. But most of the time it turns out like ""Queen of the damned"": unwatchable.Lestat (you know, the character from ""Interview with the vampire"") wakes up and needs a way to cope with todays society. He decides to become a rock star, and his music wakes up the ""Queen of the damned"". A vampire queen that has been asleep for centuries, now she wants to rule the earth with Lestat as her husband.This movie displays almost everything that is wrong with Vampire movies. The acting first of all is terrible. Everyone walks around trying painfully hard to look cool in leather and rubber, most of them using thick fake accents since apparently no Vampire has ever learned to speak proper English. Worst here is Vincent Perez as the man who made Lestat a Vampire. Second of all it always seems that every film-maker doing a Vampire-movie has to try and introduce some sexual tension. Apparently Vampires are very seductive and alluring, something that the actors are usually completely inept at portraying. Stuart Townsend as Lestat falls completely flat in his attempt.There has been much talk about Aaliyah and this film since it was her last role before her tragic death. But it's hard to comment her performance considering she was not actually on screen very much. Her thick accent was not flattering though and personally i wish she would have had something other than this as her last performance.There is so much i could write about why you should stay away from this movie. But what's the point, it seems these movies have their loyal following no matter how poorly made they are.

I found the movie not quite as beautifully done as ""Interview With the Vampire,"" but it was rather well done nonetheless.  While I wasn't entirely happy with Tom Cruise not returning to play Lestat, I thought Stuart Townsend did a very good job in his place.  He played Lestat as a classic vampire, being both seductive and fear-inducing.  And the late Aaliyah also turned in a very good performance. However, I can't help but wonder, along with the multitudes of Anne Rice fans, why didn't they make a movie out of Rice's ""The Vampire Lestat""  right after ""Interview With the Vampire.""

Stuart Townsend, by far inferior to Tom Cruise's Lestat in ""Interview"" stars, with the vampire awakening out of years of seclusion, and decides to come out of the closet and become a rock star! I thought about this- and for today's audiences, with David Blaine and everybody, I honestly don't think they'd really notice all the vampire stuff- I think they would just think it's just one big special effect- Oh, yeah, HE's a vampire- surrrrre. LOL The late Aaliyah is really hot as the queen of the vampires, who decides she wants Lestat all to herself (I feel bad about thinking of the dead like this- but kept hoping she would take her clothes off at some point- ?? :( ), and that actress I recently saw on ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (also on the US version of ""Shameless""), Margeurite Moreau- absolutely BEAUUUU-tiful!!All in all, I'm a bit on the fence on this movie. I think if you go into this expecting the great film Neil Jordan made in '94 with Cruise and Brad Pitt, etc.. you'll be sorely disappointed, but if you go into this just on it's own merit, it's not too bad. That being said, at times I was thinking that the acting was kinda lousy- or at least, a tad over the top-?? Lena Olin (also pretty hot for an old lady) also stars.",Queen of the Damned
49,chrisbrown6453,"Queen of the Damned is alternately an aggressive film and then tame, but it never finds equilibrium.",5,24 June 2002,"The soundtrack is blaring with punk rock through the entire movie, during some of its music-free moments there is filler sounds of screaming and thunder that seem to be coming from hell and beyond. What is ultimately the most notable is deciding whether the special effects or the dialogue is cheesier in this B-grade vampire movie. Allegedly based on Anne Rice's The Vampire's Chronicles, the movie certainly raises the question on whether director Michael Rymer has ever read the source material. There is some kind of plot here, but the reckless visual style never is able to distinguish anything of storytelling clarity, especially in the final third of the movie. Stuart Townsend plays the multi-centuries old vampire Lestat (there's a reason why Tom Cruise didn't come back), whom in the present day has become a punk rocker in effort to capture a legion of fans. This movie however is showcasing it as the feature film debut of the 22-year old singer Aaliyah, who died tragically earlier this year.  By the way, it's not her feature debut, it's not even her first `starring' role either; Romeo Must Die has those honors. Some of her fans will be disappointed that she doesn't arrive with her first speaking scene until the first hour into the movie.
There is an adrenaline of excitement when Aaliyah does make her arrival which sends the screen blazing. As the 6,000-year old vampire Akaska, the late singer has an electrifying introduction, but it is too bad however that the movie's thrills are few and far between. Townsend has a few amusing scenes where he invites a couple of groupies into his private sanctuary. The groupies are hot for this punk rocker, but Lestat is hot for their blood which is fortunate because some of the nastiness does generate some chuckles. Blood is a welcome palette of color in this movie because it is photographed in dreary, dark gray-blue tones. The scenery is often very bland, and so after awhile it becomes easy to welcome bad dialogue in order to spark some kind of amusement. Cheesy sample dialogue: `There's nothing [left] but the cold, dark wasteland of eternity,' Lestat bemuses, bored with his immortality. He thankfully has a publicist and fanfare that will encourage him with compliments like, `You're bold like your music!' A vampire scholar played by Marguerite Moreau (in need of some of Mariah Carey's acting tips) tracks down Lestat in order to learn from him, and then becomes seduced by his black charms. Unsurprisingly, there is little interest between them.
The real heat in the film exists between Lestat and Akaska, whom together momentarily resuscitate a movie in danger of flat-lining. The scenes between them, especially the ones that involve them drinking from each other's blood, are morbid but teasingly erotic. Also in this movie exists scenes of underground night clubs that patronize the vampire culture, and surprise, they are all into grunge rock. What is worse however is that much of the movie's sensationalistic scenes are filmed and edited like a bad grunge rock music video. Also, once you get past the thin and unrealized potential of the plot, there isn't much left here that will make you give a damn.",Queen of the Damned

57,RhapsodyReviews,Guilty Pleasure.,7,28 October 2019,"Review:
'Queen of the Damned' is a horror film directed by Michael Rymer. It is loosely based on the third novel in The Vampire Chronicles series by Anne Rice.
This is not you're typical vampire tale. It's a gothic and fun story and is not heavy like 'Interview with the Vampire'. If you're a fan of vampire lore and can't turn your brain off about the information on them, you might have a hard time with this movie. Although, not as bad as 'Twilight'.
Lestat de Lioncourt (Stuart Townsend) is awakened from his slumber. Bored with his existence, he has now become this generation's new Rock God. While in the course of time, another has arisen, Akasha, (Aaliyah) the Queen of the Vampires and the Dammed. He wants immortal fame, his fellow vampires want him eternally dead for his betrayal, and the Queen wants him for her King. Who will be the first to reach him? Who shall win?
While the acting might not be the best I've seen, the actors are portraying their characters in such an overly dramatic way that it makes sense still. Especially Aaliyah when she comes on screen as the Queen Akasha. You know right off that this is not a character to be messed with, and she will get her way one way or another.
I do like a lot about this movie aside from the acting, such as the amazing soundtrack. Being made in the early 2000's when goth-rock was in the up and up even if for a short while. I didn't once believe that the character of Lestat was singing these songs because they all sound like distinctly different voices, but the songs were great. I enjoyed the overall story being told, but for it being called 'Queen of the Damned' I think it should have been her story instead of Lestat's. Akasha was very under utilized in this film.
Overall, the movie had no short of entertainment and while it might not have been the tightest structure, the characters, soundtrack and story are enough for this to at least be a guilty pleasure when the moment calls for it.

58,jrfranklin01,Aaliyah & Townsend - A Terrific Pair,6,8 June 2004,"We are brought back to the miseries of the lonely Lestat (Townsend) as he roams the earth undead, yet in the shadows and otherwise dead to those around him.  For a vampire it must be quite a frustrating experience to live forever.  Exactly how many different things can you do with eternity before you begin to get sick and tired of the enigmatic life?  This in a nutshell is what drives the vampire Lestat out of hiding and into the limelight.  In a complete bipolar opposite move and as a cathartic release for his rebellious emotions, Lestat joins a band and becomes an international rock star.  He does not attempt to hide his identity, rather he shouts it out to all the public in an attempt to rouse and anger other members of the vampire clan to come out of hiding.  But exactly who he wakes up in particular is of grave importance - Akasha (Aaliyah), queen of all vampires (hence the title).What make her different (spoiler!) is that as the most pure of vampires, she can walk in the daylight and can set her enemies bursting into flames at will.  Her evil is as limitless as her hunger for blood.  What more perfect a match than Akasha and Lestat?But the joining of the two morbid souls leaves Lestat looking like a altarboy by comparison.  Akasha's darkness threatens to destroy all the world, humans and vampires.  Meanwhile, Jesse, a member of the Telamusque (vampire observation group), has become fascinated with Lestat and the mysterious of vampires.  She pursues Lestat in an attempt to become one of the undead.The battle for vampires and humans remains in jeopardy under Akasha's rule. Aaliyah's acting abilities are remarkable in one of her final performances and Stuart Townsend's portrayal as the new-celebrity Lestat is exceptional. The film carries well amid a macabre metal soundtrack appropriate to the plot (similar to The Crow soundtrack's theme).  The Queen of the Damned chronicles the vampire ancestry, proving it's not one big happy family.",Queen of the Damned
59,gtc83,"Not great, but better than I expected",5,28 February 2005,"Once you get past all the Nu-metal music and MTV pop culture overload (which is really prevalent in the first half hour or so), this is actually a pretty good movie. Back in ancient Spain (I think) a guy named Lestat (Stuart Townsend) is bitten by a vampire named Marius (Vincent Perez), who then takes him under his wing and introduces him to the vampire lifestyle. He really likes the power and immortality at first, but grows cool on the idea when he figures out that he will be pretty much alone for eternity. While sneaking around Marius' castle one evening, Lestat comes across a secret room where he finds two statues, the king and queen of all vampires. The queen's statue (Akasha, played by Aaliyah) comes partially to life, and Lestat drinks a bit of her blood and gains a bit more power, and perhaps a lot more attitude than he had previously. This increased amount of arrogance comes to fruition hundreds of years later (fast forward to the present), as Lestat is a Nu-metal rock star and has publicly stated that vampires are among us. The rest of the vampires get mad, Akasha comes back to life, they kill off all the vampires that oppose them, then Akasha offers Lestat the opportunity to be her king and rule over the world with her.There's also a subplot about some girl who was raised by vampires but wasn't one herself, who was sent away to live among the mortals but who always wanted to be a vampire, and she hangs around at a vampire bar and eventually comes back to the vampires who raised her just in time for the big showdown. Overall that whole subplot seemed like a distraction more than anything else.This movie has a lot of cool stuff in it. In ancient times, Lestat was a violin player, and when he finds the statues of the vampires, instead of being fearful he cheerfully asks them if they'd like to hear some music. It's scenes like that which make this a good movie. I'd say the acting is very good overall, as Lestat is quite a fascinating character in old Spain, though he turns into a complete cliché when he's a Nu-metal star. Aaliyah does an excellent job as the queen of the vampires, totally unsympathetic to humans, vampires, and pretty much anything else. It's the way the character needs to be, and she pulls if off very well. Looks very good doing it too!The biggest problem is all the MTV pop culture stuff. This movie is going to seem incredibly dated in 10 or 20 years. But Lestat's violin playing makes up for it. Some of the dialog and action sequences are supremely corny and very B-movie in attitude, but it doesn't drag the movie down too badly. It could have been great, but it turned out pretty good.",Queen of the Damned

And I could spit in the face of anyone who dares compare Stuart Townsend to Tom Cruise. There's no contest. Tom understood the character, felt for him, became him. Anne Rice, herself, said he was the perfect Lestat and called Townsend's... Whatever that was as being too cold and humourless and not her Lestat but these teeny boppers (Oh, dear, I'm labelling) can't accept that and latch on to what they consider to be a pretty face. Townsend wasn't playing Lestat. He was playing Dracula in a leather coat but I could rant for hours about that.When Tom Cruise played Lestat in Interview with The Vampire there was layers to the personality. The pleading look as he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' The way he worried for Louis as Louis ran out into the rain, the way he saved Louis from the fire, the angst the personality it was all there.WIth Stuart Townsend you had nothing. The acting was wooden. Shallow. And even if you had never read the Anne Rice novels this movie doesn't stand up on it's own. It makes little sense. And the 'hero' kills innocent girls at random because according to the director's commentary good and evil are too abstract to feed on evil doers as he did in the novels. What's so abstract about killing murderers who feel no remorse? Good and evil were major themes in the book but anyway... Aside from the book this 'hero' had to be told twice that Akasha had killed her old king from two completely different characters. And each time he was surprised. Talk about a short attention span. This movie was designed to appeal to people with a very low IQ and little respect for the original source material, be it Interview with the vampire the movie or the novels. And as a stand alone film I don't think I'd even tolerate it on Mystery science theatre.I did like the songs Forsaken and Not meant for me so I'll give it credit for that but ONLY that.

I can do the math, straight to video = bad.

I thought the whole concept of LeStat the Rock n Roll vampire holding a press conference to announce that he his a real vampire and challenging other Vampires to ""come out, come out where ever you are"" was as stupid as it sounds. and when the lady at the press conference asked him ""how others in the vampire community felt about him announcing that he is real vampire."" and so seriously nodded her head as if it were totaly normal and vampire were some form of ethnic group--that whole sceen was an insult to the inteligence of the average movie goer.- and if the Rock n Roll vampire thing wasnt bad enough the writers added a ancient Egyptian Vampire God-Queen to the story who just worders around killing people and vampires both just because she can.

I hated to see such a waste of good actors, great costumes and briliant soundtrack. this movie is an insults to your intelligence 15 mins after it starts and gets worst and worst as it goes along.",Queen of the Damned

67,giancarlorocks,"'The Lost Boys' it ain't, but it will surprise...",7,20 February 2002,"The gullible movie fan can always count on the Hollywood Sophists to mislead us all with a trailer. Upon viewing the trailer for Queen of the Damned', one would assume that since it boasted the late singer Aaliyah's final film debut, she would have quite the predominant role. Yet how presumptuous would be to assume that. For it is not the case, the singer's scenes in the film have been unevenly slashed since her death and she appears mostly in the final stages of the film. Yet, that is not to say that the film revolves around her character, for she is the titular character, but actor Stuart Townsend owns the film In this apparent sequel to Interview With the Vampire', Townsend portrays the character Tom Cruise made famous in the former film. In this Gen-X film, Lestat returns after a century of sleep only to find himself bored with immortality. Thus making way for Akasha, a 6000-year-old Queen Vampire who promises him much more than he could ever imagine. I must admit, expectations were low coming into this film. I am not an avid horror fan and do not find myself caring much for films of this caliber, yet many surprises were in hand upon the viewing of the film. Released by Warner Brothers, the film was certainly modestly budgeted but contained some great production values. The settings were elegant and the film captured a seemingly eerie yet graceful aura that did not make this film seem something it was not. Perhaps a borderline thriller, the film rarely makes an attempt to terrify. Yet tells a story of a vampire who awakens an ancient evil in order to search for more. The film opens in an interesting manner and makes us realize that we should take this film a little more seriously than at first glance. Lestat returns only to find himself in a rock Band and while the public thinks his Vampire gimmick is a front; Lestat has other plans that are conveyed by Townsend decadently immersing himself in the role of the lustful and bloodthirsty vampire.      Director Michael Rymer (Perfume, In Too Deep) is at the helm of what appears to be his first mainstream film and certainly surprises. Though the script may be quite weak, and the visual effects may also be characterized as ordinary, the discerning viewer will notice a solid attempt at creating a haunting and at times enchanting tale about a vampire's quest for something that just might be unable to achieve.      The film certainly has its' flaws, if dissected; the objective viewer will note the pacing will be a tad bland at times and many things seem to be too convenient. Yet the film does have an interesting cast including a surprisingly elegant and masterful French actor Vincent Perez as Lestat's mentor Marias. Lena Olin also joins the cast as the watchful aunt of Jessie (Marguerite Moreau), a fanatical Vampire Scholar who will stop at nothing at discovering the secrets of the nocturnal.      As aforementioned, I was quite surprised at the outcome of the film. Based on Anne Rice's follow up Novel to Interview With the Vampire', the same sensual and erotic themes are contained within the film yet are handed gracefully.  The film does not turn itself into a soft porn romp, but neither does it connect the sensuality to the cause. This in my view is one of the main conflicts within the film. The sensual undertones seem to be overshadowed by the film's explicit attempts to woo us with its' style and appeal.      Furthermore, the film seems to be gearing itself towards a Gen-X audience. How can one tell? Listen to the soundtrack, heavy metal tracks bombard the viewer in the film and makes an attempt to connect to the grunge attitude encompassing the present day world. Yet, in relation to poorer films that have the same target audience, this film escapes the trap without the slightest pretense.  Instead of overflowing itself with stupidity that it could have easily engulfed itself in, the film is embedded with an ambitious, admirable and tender eye that Rymer brings to the film. Is it the best film out there? No. Is it the best Vampire film? Leave that to The Lost Boys'. Just enjoy this film for what it is; a matinee-like thriller that looks great and that may surprise many.Giancarlo's Rating: **",Queen of the Damned
68,fibreoptic,Stupid but good.,8,19 February 2004,"When i learnt of a new Anne Rice vampire movie coming out about Lestat becoming a goth rock star with his very own band i automatically assumed this would be terrible but i really enjoyed watching this movie. It has some shocks and most of the acting is good. Don't mean to speak ill of the dead or anything but Aaliyah's (R.I.P.) acting is very bad and she acts far too over the top but she's not in it that much so that's a plus (sorry Aaliyah fans, i thought she was a good singer though). Stuart Townsend's performance was in general good even though he looked a bit weedy near the end when he was half naked and i do think Tom Cruise played Lestat far better. Vincent Perez as Marius did an awesome performance and was the best thing in the film (he should have been in the movie more, not Aaliyah). Queen Of The Damned didn't follow on correctly from the end of Interview With The Vampire which left me a bit miffed as i like continuity and some elements of the film did seem stupidly cheesy (the whole goth band thing) but it was fairly original in places. I liked the music even though i don't really like rock music. I know a lot of people don't like this movie but i don't care, i enjoyed it. All in all pretty entertaining. 8/10",Queen of the Damned
69,TheArgentWolf,Brilliant!,8,18 May 2005,"I prepared myself for this movie in case I got confused by attempting to read the book - but at seeing the length of the book, I quickly thought it better watching Interview With A Vampire - but it seems I didn't need to, because Queen Of The Damned was so captivating in itself, all other movies could be forgotten.Being honest, I watched it and bought it because of Aaliyah, but I loved her, and every other person in the movie. It's also turned me into a Marguerite Moreau fan, because she was excellent in it as well.It has been criticised by saying it doesn't stay true to the book - but I challenge anyone to try and fit the entire length of the book into one movie, without needing to miss parts of it out.The only thing I didn't like and that I wished I was warned about was the bit with Akasha first in the club - I'm not giving anything away, but it made me feel pretty ill.A perfect movie to watch with friends late at night.",Queen of the Damned
70,moonmonday,"Lestat, the Queen of the Damned!",3,14 April 2010,"To understand that this film was intended as a direct-to-video one but was released into cinemas seemingly to capitalise on Aaliyah's tragic death makes me hold it in even higher contempt; the fact that they essentially eliminated any homoerotic content from it is contemptible enough (especially as plenty was present in Interview), but trying to invent an artificial female character who is barely even a part of the story, then asking the audience to assume some kind of bond that does not exist is far too much. Was Akasha not enough for our apparently homophobic screenwriter? Thankfully, at the very least, she is a more compelling villainess than in the books, where she was nothing more than a maniacal feminazi, and Aaliyah does give a compelling performance...for the twenty or so minutes of screen time she has.Pacing is probably the largest problem with this film, as too much time is taken with attempting to showcase the frankly awful music that Lestat and his band make. One imagines they desperately needed the gimmick of him claiming to be a vampire, as otherwise few would have even paid attention to the melodically bereft noise they generated. This time would have been much better spent developing the character of Akasha, trying to make Lestat even remotely likable or sympathetic, or adding some form of coherency to Jesse's bare-bones backstory. Viewers may complain about Akasha being too over-the-top, but what else could she do when the script refused to give her any development whatsoever? All she could do was present herself as a would-be conqueror. And at the very least, she had more screen presence than any of the rest of the unfortunate cast.Lestat came off as a poseur, a douchebag, and a completely unsympathetic, unlikable character. The audience were supposed to be concerned, several times, when it seemed he would be destroyed by 'evil vampires', yet the film failed to make him anything but annoying, selfish, and pedestrian. This was not helped by Stuart Townsend's weak performance and inconstant accent, nor was it helped by the fact that the makeup department dropped the ball on several shots where he was clearly supposed to be powdered and made up to be deathly pale, yet was not. Visual appeal was all he had, and several times that failed.Jesse was nothing but a cipher, as transparent an audience insertion character as could be. Her story could have been made interesting, but the audience was asked to make too many leaps of logic that would have been better developed by the film itself.In fact, that in many ways is the greatest problem with the film: it makes no sense at all, leaps around constantly, and never ends up with any logical coherency. I find it problematic that Rice's vampires always kill their prey (but inexplicably not the last drop) because that would be like taking an apple from a huge apple tree and then cutting the tree down and throwing the rest away. I don't have a problem with vampires out during the daylight because even the original fictional vampire, Carmilla, could do this. Akasha being out in the day wasn't a problem I had. It was the rest of the story that constantly failed.I repeatedly found myself asking 'what?' and 'how does that even work?' in this film. People turning to statues for no reason...people suddenly being in one place or another without any explanation...some clandestine organisation of extremely bored presumed researchers who never do anything...a temple in the middle of the desert that has no real reason for existing...what does it all mean? Wouldn't the vampires attacking Lestat right when he calls them out call more attention to them than his divulging of supposed secrets? More likely it would seem they'd just ignore him and everyone would assume he's just another second-rate goth demagogue looking for attention. Why would Marius try to hide something behind an easily-uncovered passage from his sensory-enhanced scion, then blithely leave him alone, presuming he wouldn't uncover it? Why would Jesse be chosen as one of the fans to see Lestat, not even remotely looking the part? How is it possible that Lestat managed to cover up the dead bodies of the people he ate, especially after telling everyone he's a vampire? Wouldn't the police kind of find it suspicious that dead, blood-drained bodies had been showing up wherever he went? Wasn't he supposed to feed only from killers and the morally bereft, instead of just any and every tart brought to him? Everything on the story hinges on tremendous coincidence, with inadequate plausible premise presented.Along with the problematic title -- which seems to indicate more that Lestat himself is the queen of the damned, and quite a queen he is -- the whole thing is just a huge mess.And you can't expect me to believe that they couldn't afford to get someone to walk on for five minutes at the end as Louis, for some small modicum of continuity. Maybe if they had used, I don't know, 500 less extras, they could've afforded at least a decent actor to give it something of a satisfactory conclusion.But no, they didn't even do that. At the end of it all, it was a big ho-hum where nothing much happened and what did happen was completely confusing and incoherent. It's annoying enough that Anne Rice is regarded as such a go-to person for vampires (though perhaps not anymore as she's become a tad bonkers), even more annoying when people use her work as so much window-dressing and actually manage to make a much worse story.",Queen of the Damned
71,Ripe Peach,Unpleasantly like being drunk...,1,17 April 2002,"...in the ""ask a glass of water"" kind of way.  This extended rock video actually induced nausea in me.  The most likely cause of my retching was probably the deeply cynical butchering of Anne Rice's (admitedly somewhat angst ridden and tiresome) original novels.Not much survived.  Some names.  Some plot elements cobbled together from two books, at least in as much as they involved the named characters.  A very few scenes.  Perhaps three lines of dialogue.  But the *core* of the titular novel was gutted, and most of this film is just pure lowest common denominator pulp, undemanding celluloid fantasy for the under-21 MTV audience.  It feels cheap, and it feels tacky, and that's because it *is* cheap and tacky.  I really wanted to shower after watching it, and not in a good way.Then there's Aaliyah.

72,jimorris,Charming Aaliyah,8,22 February 2002,"""Queen of the Damned"" is an MTV horror film in the tradition of the Hammer Films of the 60's, VERY loosely based on the Anne Rice novel.  It is also a vehicle for the displaying the charms of Aaliyah.  Her performance reminds one of the following stars:  Ursula Andress in ""She""  Claudette Colbert in ""Cleopatra""  Rhonda Fleming in ""Queen of Babylon""  Gina Lollobrigida in ""Solomon & Sheba"".  She's the best part of the film and has too little screen time.",Queen of the Damned
73,mocaler,Stopped watching it after the killing of the girls,1,15 May 2020,"In the second book and onward, Lestat restricted himself to killing murderers. He developed a sense of ethics about how to sustain his existence. So I was astonished when his manager brought in 2 girls who Lestat killed. There was no sign of them being the kind of evil-doers who the books' Lestat would have killed. So that was the sign for me that the movie was going to move far away from the books. One of the attractions of Lestat, after Interview, was that he endeavored to be more ethical. But the scene with the girls seemed like the movie was sexualizing the murder of innocents. I stopped watching it. Although Anne Rice's vampire novels went too far into supernatural territory for my tastes, I still feel that her portrayal of an ethical vampire was more interesting. I read that the director believed that concepts of good and evil would not fit in the vampire story. But I think that it makes for a more compelling story to have vampires able and willing to consider ethics in how they survive. Plus I think that some behaviors, such as those of this movie's Lestat, should not be portrayed as somehow OK.",Queen of the Damned

The movie also took a bad tole on reality. Who knew after rising from a hundred year rest in a cascate, you could instantly become a rockstar? If I was a vampire I would have a very dry throat and couldn't even talk. DAMNED is just another excuse for seeing people get their necks bitten, their blood sucked, and then turned into vampires--and its all too boring. Don't waste your money.

A lot have read Anne Rice and think ""why did they take 3 books into this film and leave half questions unanswered?"". So did I. There is far too much in Anne Rice that would get the poor woman into trouble if her writings were read by the man on the street that it was a reasonably safe bet to remove this religiously sensitive material from the film and work on the fun bits of ""how much fun can you have when you are a vampire"". It looks more like a ""Dracula is my friend"" than like the strong material where it came from but the whole remains very enjoyable. Photography and set design in particular are exceptional and if you're not tempted to dress in black, leather jacket, piercing where nature can allow, well you probably never will. I guess young Goths will simply love this film and rush out buy something - anything provided it's black with silver on it.In my view a very well done sequel that does not claim to be 100% sequel, and a fairly good use of a material which was not easy to get on screen.",Queen of the Damned

However, releasing this movie after Aaliyah's death does not do her justice.This movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.

You can stop living in the 80s.What I did find to be... pretty good... mostly... was the acting. Aaliyah was pretty good, and Stuart Townsend was... ok. His acting went flat a few times.I believe that if you see that this movie's on HBO or Cinemax, by all means knock yourselves out.

It's got a lot of flaws - it's never a good sign when the deleted scenes and DVD commentary are more enjoyable than the stand-alone film - but it's not at all a horrible movie. It messed with and compressed/redid the Anne Rice novels so much that few people seem to like it - but I think if you go into without expecting it to be Anne Rice's Lestat, but rather a story loosely ""inspired by"" her books, it's a decent little goth movie.Particularly Queen/Damned's music, by guys from Korn, Static X and even Marilyn Manson (who has one great album, Mechanical Animals, his Ziggy Stardust glam tribute/ripoff), and Stuart Townsend as Lestat. While no Tom Cruise, he's a lot better than you'd expect, and certainly believable as a rock star.As surprisingly dynamic as Cruise was in Interview/Vampire, there's no WAY he could have done the rock star turn without making everyone laugh while remembering the tightie whitey dance from Risky Business!",Queen of the Damned

I Still can't understand why so many over rate that garbage?Stuart Townsend was pretty slick as the vampire Lestat, so much that he resembles Brandon Lee's look from The Crow. It's not surprising to learn as to why this movie was given a lukewarm response from the critics as to a rather weak story and thin plot. However it was also nice to see that many took notice of Aaliyah's performance as this not doubt helped provide more publicity and success received. Though I'm a fan of vampires I was annoyed that it was only granted a ""15"" rating in the U.K. as I'm sure it would've been more gorier.It was also nice to see French actor Vincent Perez playing another dark Gothic role as Lestat's vampire maker since his role in The Crow: City of Angels (no way better than the original). And the beautiful Swedish actress Lena Olin and newcomer Marguerite Moreau for their supportive performances. One of the most beautifully crafted scenes that really deserves a thumbs up is the ""concert confrontation"" involving Stuart Townsend and Vincent Perez and a large group of angry vampires battling it out on center stage in front of a large crowd of fans.

From what I can recall, my lasting impressions of the movie had been that: 1.  It was one of the better vampire movies within the last ten years; it beat Interview with a Vampire hands down. 2.  It was an erotic film, and Aaliyah was quite seductive. 3.  It was disappointing in that important scenes were cut from the movie. (Where did these people learn to edit a movie??  Why in the world they cut out the introductory scenes for the ancient vampires, in addition to a few other important scenes?  Before I saw the DVD feature about the scenes cut from the movie, I had to guess who Armand, etc. was.) 4.  The soundtrack kicked ass. As with any movie, it was different than the novel.  For example, Lestat could not fly until he drank enough of Akasha's blood in the 20th Century. At least the movie wasn't as gay as the novel.All in all, it was an excellent movie.  If you had to decide between the DVD and VCR formats, purchase the DVD version.  It has important cut scenes that you can watch after the movie, in addition to a few other features, including background information about the soundtrack.  Jonathon Davis of Korn did an excellent job putting everything together.",Queen of the Damned

86,jimboduck,Read the book first -- 7 (Worth the time),7,13 March 2005,"I haven't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything.JYJimboduck-dot-com",Queen of the Damned
87,seeingbystarlight,When The ldea Of Eternity Becomes Momentarily Unbearable...,4,17 October 2018,"Queen of the Damned has been a complicated film to me ever since I saw it at age 16 when it was first released in 2002.On the one hand it's a very sad Swan Song for Aaliyah whose role as Akasha doesn't do her any favors, and who should have never taken it to begin with. She was dazzling as Trish O'Day playing opposite Jet Li in Romeo Must Die. And she should have just left it at that.On the other hand, we have the vastly superior performance of Stuart Townsend over Tom Cruise as Lestat (Tom Cruise is an incredible actor but Lestat just doesn't suit him at all), as well as a relationship no one cares to comment on...A relationship which effectively ends any future he might have with the titular character before it's even had a chance to start.It's all there, in the synopsis, for anyone to read:Lestat, a vampire, reinvents himself as a rockstar, awakens Akasha the Queen of the Damned, and catches the eye of a beautiful young London woman named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who falls passionately in love with him.Yet the critics, for some reason, have decided to ignore this one little detail: Roger Ebert skips the relationship all together, focusing instead on there possibly being more to his association with Marius (Vincent Perez). Still another reviewer from the San Francisco Chronicle chops it up to Lestat's ""seduction of a librarian"" as if Jesse Reeves were an extra he had a fling with in passing, instead of a driving force to be reckoned with throughout the story...A story which is extremely low on suspense once we see where it's all going. That Jesse Reeves is responsible for cancelling out a lot of that suspense is something that seems to have been lost on people.That's probably because they choose to see her as just another groupie, instead of a character who eclipses any enchantment Akasha might have in the eyes of Lestat...albeit on a subliminal level.Marguerite Moreau is good here. She has a poise and solemnity which make it believable that her obsession with him (which will take over her entire life) is rooted in something deeper than contemptible rockstar erotomania. The fact that he reciprocates--that there's an actual attraction between them--gives the plot it's edge while, at the same time, spoiling Akasha's entrance.It's the only part of the story that's interesting, and it's a part of the story people callously chose to ignore.It makes you wonder if anybody was actually watching the movie.",Queen of the Damned

The acting, generally, is at least consistent with a gaggle of hysterical shrieking queens--Stuart Townsend, in particular, is reminiscent of Hayden Christiansen Darth-Vader-pouting-teen, but with really bad eye makeup.And then we have the alleged sole queen, Akasha, interpreted by Aaliyah--a new candidate for worst eye-scorching-shockingly-horrible-the-universe-is-about-to-collapse performance by an (alledged) actress. Yes, friends, she slinks, she pouts, she snarls, she looks about as Egyptian as Debbie Boone. Not even the COSTUME looks Egyptian.And what's the single worst thing about this film--without further examination of more bad acting, without examination of flatfooted direction, without even noting the utter absurdity of the plot, even by Anne Rice's dubious standards? It's not even good campy fun. It's not even so-bad-it's-good--it's too bad for that. It makes the average Ed Wood film look like Citizen Kane. It combines the portentous pretension of The Unbearable Lightness of Being with grade Z-minus acting standards. Not even the (fair) production values save it.Do not waste your time. You actually risk brain damage by watching it.",Queen of the Damned

Gee, that takes willing suspension of disbelief to a new level. I don't know if the book this is based on is this dumb but whoever greenlighted this movie should be shot. Bad acting too but not bad enough to be funny. Just a dull dull movie. I adored interview with the vampire and this movie does not measure up in any way whatsoever. The actor who plays lestat lacks any charisma as well. I fell asleep during this film. Avoid like the plague.",Queen of the Damned
95,owen_twistfield,A story of a bored vampire and his bad tempered super-vampire girlfriend,5,22 June 2008,"Let me state beforehand that I have not read any of Anne Rice's novels nor seen the movie Interview with the Vampire, so I will concentrate on this movie as is. Also you need to be prepared as the movie is a bit confusing as there are no less then three threads woven in the story. I have read that the movie is based on two of the novels of Anne Rice, which the writers then try to work into one movie. This might explain the obvious complexity.The main thread of the movie tells us of the vampire Lestat who gets involved in awakening Akasha, a god-like vampire, who's first and only thought after rising is to destroy anything in her path. Since us mortals can have a sour mood after one night, this might reflect the hangover an immortal can have after sleeping several thousands of years(and been fed upon by Lestat somewhere along the line). Not an unreasonable sentiment I suppose. This first thread is getting more confused because for some reason Akasha has decided that Lestat will be her consort and therefore is excluded from the list of beings to exterminate. We are not told why. Maybe this is what sucking on super-vampires will do for you. The second thread of the movie is taken up by the story of the world-weary vampire Lestat in which we are told that his unlife is dull. In fact he is bored from the moment he is turned into a vampire and in the end he is so bored that he exposes himself to the public by becoming a Gothic rock-star(hint: Marilyn Manson) thus invoking the wrath of the other vampires, who don't like to be exposed to the general public. Anything for a little bit of excitement I suppose. The third thread is the story of a girl named Jesse who's only mission in life seems to be to offer herself as a sacrifice to Lestat. Lestat refuses to do his duty as a vampire and serves anyone else but this girl up to the very end. Maybe not unreasonable in hindsight, as this girl chases away his boredom this way. However this idea is never brought forward in the movie. But with all this complexity you need to have a good crew to make the movie work and here is where it starts to falter. This movie has an obvious tight budget with it low budget gci graphics and inexpensive movie tricks and works with a unremarkable crew starting from the director down to the screenplay writers and cast. The director might not be bad, but in this movie he is certainly not great. The writers(Anne Rice seems to have declined the honor of participating) have difficulty to work the novels into a proper story line. Not strange since they have no track record to speak off. Unfortunately the movie for a large part is made up out of dialog and while this might sound easy to achieve, it is in fact very difficult to keep an audience captivated with dialog for more then five minutes. And in this movie more then half of the running time is made up out of dialog only. The main cast isn't inspiring. Stuart Townsend I found uninteresting. Aaliyah certainly is interesting and she was around that time a popular singer, but as an actress she had almost no experience and in this movie she moves and speaks in an awkward way as if she is partly a snake. Maybe this was on purpose, but the reason is not explained and to me it just looks likes bad acting. Perez and Moreau are decent actors, but their characters are so locked down that they can't save the movie whatever they do. What I found a bad point for the movie is the fact that it to obvious tries to attract various audiences. Aaliyah is added to attract her admirers, Townsend is a Gothic rock artist to attract the Gothic crowd(and gives away a almost ten minute performance halfway the movie for this end only) and the story itself is set to entice Anne Rice fans. None of these people will watch the movie with satisfaction I think.My entire point is that the movie could have been better if the team had concentrated on one main thread, added more action and had made more of Aaliyah's other talent: performing. Personally I would have replaced Townsend by Perez. The entire 'Jesse' story was pointless and could have been left out. The look back on Lestats past seems also rather pointless so it could have been left out as well, or maybe only brought up as flashback. The Gothic look of some parts of the movie is so overused that leaving it out would alone have improved it instantly.All in all the story was to much for the crew and in the end they where overwhelmed by it. So when you go and watch it, don't expect too much as it is a mediocre movie at best.",Queen of the Damned
96,TheRowdyMan,Good Soundtrack but...uh...that's it.,3,17 January 2003,"A major disappointment on all fronts. The soundtrack, provided by, Korn front man Jonathan Davis, is not bad at all: it's just a shame I can't say the same about the film. This routine vampire flick, dogged by pedestrian acting and un-charismatic characters (which is a major problem given that Lestat is meant to be a rock star!) is pretty average. And married with Stuart Townsend's wooden acting is some laughably bad dialogue. Ascetically, it comes off like a big budget tele-movie. Do yourself a favour and rent 'Near Dark' instead.NOTE: You know a film's in trouble when the author of the book (Ann Rice) offers to help with writing the and they turn her down.",Queen of the Damned
97,zerodegreesk,Good Stuff!,8,25 February 2002,"I went in expecting the worst.  I came out really, really surprised by how much I liked it.  Maybe the key was I was expecting horrible trash because the majority of reviews were soooooo critical.  However, Stuart Townsend was so much better in the part of Lestat, in my opinion.  This movie LOOKED fantastic.  The style was great, especially the whole  Kabinett des Doktor Caligari theme to the Lestat videos and stage show.  It doesn't take itself too horribly serious, either, which should be apparent during the vampire battle during the Death Valley show.  The only part that I thought took away from the film was the whole Talamasca bit.  It just seemed to be in there to help explain so many things that couldn't more easily be crammed into an hour and forty minutes.  So, it was kinda weak, but necessary for production's sake.  That happens sometimes.In all I give it an 8 out of 10.  It was something I wanted to see again right after, which doesn't happen very often and for me tells me it was something good.Also, if there wasn't so much baggage to be taken in with this movie, it would be considered much better.  It kicked ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" weak ass!  It was better than ""Interview..."" in total value, though the first obviously had a lot more money and production thrown at it.  The story that was arranged for this movie was good, period.  It may have butchered the books, but it's true to itself, and is at least, at the VERY least, as good as the ""Blade"" series that's out there.",Queen of the Damned

Kind of half vampire movie, half rock video.The reason I like Queen of the Damned? Stuart Townsend as Lestat - he is utterly beautiful in this film. Sexy, seductive, with model-looks. The man looks the part and he plays the part very well too. You can understand why characters are seduced by him. He totally oozes that kind of sexy rockstar charm.I know the movie is literally nothing like the novel, and it garnered a LOT of criticism for that, as well as it generally not being a particularly great movie even if you treat it as stand-alone.I tend to put this movie on when I fancy watching something a little silly that doesn't require an awful lot of thinking about. Its kind of early 2000s trash at its finest.",Queen of the Damned
99,Musidora,Fun schlock for a Friday night...,6,2 March 2002,"I remember when Rice's book, INTERVIEW..., was released the FIRST time in the 70s.  I was in junior high school at the time, read half of it, and tossed it in the bin to take its place with the rest of the trash.  For the life of me, I never dreamed the book, one of the most poorly written I'd ever picked up, would be resurrected years later AND find an audience. So, all that said and bitchy as I am, I thought the film version of INTERVIEW... was abominable.I was particularly disappointed in this film because it was directed by Neil Jordan who, having worked with Angela Carter on THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, should have known better how to convey the eroticism and arcana of vampirism.  Sadly, none of Carter's insight into vampire lore seemed to have rubbed off on him or Rice.  As I mentioned, I never finished reading INTERVIEW; but, judging the film version on its own merits, it was as bad as the book; ultimately, a film of wasted opportunities and too much posturing; an exercise in pretentious presentation of a subject as if it is new and undiscovered; an assumption that its audience is too dumb to know more or better.But QUEEN...is another story altogether.  When I first saw the film's trailer, I groaned audibly, but, a few days later, I began to rethink it. Why was I taking it so seriously?  Why didn't I just go see the film for fun, for fantasy, for Friday night and leave it at that?  So I went to see it this evening, and I enjoyed it!I must admit, I'm not entirely sure why I enjoyed it. The opening credits sequence with its homage to DAS KABINETT... is, at this point, cliched. Townsend's accent is dodgy and his posing and sneering tiresome.  Frankly, posturing, by a number of the film's actors, is a major flaw of this film. And there was just too much MAC and talcum powder all around and not particularly well applied, I might add. And was so much money spent on make-up that there was none left to pay a script editor or language coach with even a basic knowledge of French?  Between all the different pronounciations of the name Lestat and such glaring mistakes as ""Je suis Lestat..."" I have to wonder.But, on the plus side, there is a real heady dose of artful, decadent, old, and older, world arcana on display particularly when the narrative shifted, early on, to the vampirizing of Lestat and his first encounter with the gorgonized Akasha.  Also, Akasha's later presentation is splendid, bizarre, beautiful, and grotesque all at once, and, as far as I'm concerned, worth the price of admission. Also, it was interesting to see a heroine who is hairier than the hero--adds a certain earthy frisson to the proceedings.Having seen so many horror films and vampire films, in particular, I have to say that QUEEN's plot holds its own.  Frankly, in terms of plot, I've never seen a thoroughly satisfying vampire motion picture; and, to make it easier on my willing suspension of disbelief, I find it best to approach them completely on their own terms.  Sometimes it works--the enchanting vampire film VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS comes to mind--sometimes it doesn't (see INTERVIEW...).  QUEEN falls squarely in between, and it's just right for a Friday night.",Queen of the Damned

The music was a joke, but what would you expect from a film that Korn's lead singer put the music together for?

It was much better than watching a bunch of Fabio vampires prance around in frilly costumes and whine about having to kill people (Interview).  My wife, who enjoys Anne Rice's work, also really enjoyed this one.  If you're expecting high society dressed in Victorian costumes, you will not enjoy this movie.

104,exterminator_99,"This is a bad, bad film",1,11 April 2002,"I'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films I don't think deserve a mention.  But, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I DON'T like a film.  ""Queen of the Damned"" is one of those films.Anne Rice's popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful ""An Interview With A Vampire"". Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience.  While it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I have never been that enamoured with the Vampire genre in general).
Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on to much bigger things. It's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel.  They would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome.  ""Queen of the Damned"" typifies the type of cr*p Hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.Needless to say this film is terrible from the start.  Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of ""Shooting Fish"" fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, Nu-Metal.  He freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is.  Along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a Vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen King.The film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour.  Anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general!  Watching Townsend is enjoyable.  He knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting.  The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role.  She has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest.  The poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.It is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until Aaliyah's untimely death last year.  With the possibility for people to see her final film, Warner Bros put this out to a general release.  Otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.No doubt films like this will continue to be made.  Look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like ""Not Another Teen Movie"".  If there is a market to exploit Hollywood will do so.The biggest issue I have with this film is not the film itself.  Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it.  That's business.  But what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it!  I guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is film art first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around?  The only people who can decide that is the audience.  If you like and are intrigued by good films, stay clear of this turkey.",Queen of the Damned

And I, as a fan of vampire books etc, I like the unlikely story, Ayliahs acting, and most of all, the feeling when I watch it.It is not a scary movie.

106,sallyshirla,I'm surprised,8,11 March 2019,The rating is a bit low for what I consider one of the better vampire films of the modern era. Aaliyah had such a promising career and does deliver in this film.,Queen of the Damned
107,Ace_of_Sevens,"Great Soundtrack, Lame Movie",3,10 October 2003,"With Queen of the Damned, as with many adaptations and sequels, there is the question of whether it should be judged on its own merits or relative to the original.  As this movie is an adaptation and a sequel, this applies double. The answer I suppose, depends on how familiar you are with the original works.This project showed problems from the beginning.  Though it was a sequel to a critical and financial success , the budget was 30% lower and Anne Rice, who adapted her own novel the first time around, was denied the chance to do so again.In fact, forget what I said about this being a sequel.  None of the cast and crew from Interview with the Vampire return, the events of the previous movie are never mentioned, the style is quite different and only one character returns in any identifiable way.  What you're left with is two movies with a vampire named Lestat who seems to be full of himself.  If it weren't for the novels and Anne Rice's credit, people would probably regard this as a coincidence.Queen of the Damned inadvisably combines Anne Rice's novels Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat into a single feature.  Fans of the books will be upset by the nearly eliminated back-story and the numerous changes, many of them significant and without apparent reason.  People who aren't familiar with the books will probably be a little more receptive, but even on its own merits, the movie isn't very good.Its main problem is that the script is full of ideas that aren't developed very well.  We're left with characters that are doing things, but why and why we should care are barely touched upon because the sections explaining that were removed or altered.  For instance, the ancients, who played a major part in the book, are in the movie, but we aren't told why they're here or who they are.  They're  just some vampires who show up for some reason.A slightly more serious problem is we aren't given any characters to like or identify with.  Unlike the book, the vampire characters kill indiscriminately, making them come across as much more villainous. Jesse, the only major mortal character comes across as dumb.  If we don't like anyone or understand what's going on, how are we supposed to care how it all turns out?The acting is serviceable, but not great.  Vincent Perez is quite good as Marius, and Aaliyah has a strong  screen presence, but her dubbed dialogue doesn't really work.  Everyone else is one notch above bad. Accents are a particularly notable problem.  Lead Stuart Townsend's attempt at a French accent is unfortunately one of the worst.The special effects are a mixed bag.  The vampire deaths are very impressive, but the speed and flying effects are laughable.  The sad part is that the DVD shows a documentary about the special effects and several of the other ideas they considered for this effect looked much better.The only real saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack.  Richard Gibbs and Jonathan Davis collaborated on an excellent score and also several original songs Lestat's  band performs.  While I know a few people disagree with me, I feel these are very fitting .  It's perfectly believable these songs could become hits and they seem just like what Lestat would come up with.I'm giving this movie a 3/10.  The music and a few good effects and production design decisions are all that keep it from being a one.  It isn't campy enough to be fun, isn't scary at all, so doesn't work as horror and has no apparent point or themes so it doesn't make for good drama either. Recommended for the morbidly curious only.  Watch at your own risk.",Queen of the Damned

It is a great movie and is interesting to see more Lestat than Loey because the first one (Interview with the Vampire) focused more one Loey. It was neat to see it in modern day instead of in the 1700's to 1800's. Also John Davis from Korn sings as Lestats' voice. It has a great story about how Lestat is very lonely and went to sleep.

As a film, it sort of spent 90 minutes getting started, just in time for Aaliyah to go ""RAR! I will kill you all!"" and then time for some more vampire-fu. A real shame that the depth and complexity of Ms Rice's better early Vampire novels were lost. Characters crossed the screen for no apparent reason, and only reformed goths like me could point and say ""oh, that's Mael"". In fact, the film bore so little resemblance to ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" that they may as well have called it something completely different. So, no story, no development, poor pacing. But it's a very pretty film, and Stuart Townsend is a very pretty Lestat (better in some respects than Cruise). The stage fight is hilarious (watch out for the wires!). Paul McGann occasionally looks like he's asking himself what the hell he's doing in this film.

112,mysteriouspersonage,Can't hold a candle to 'Interview with the Vampire' but...,6,10 December 2008,"There were good and bad things about this film.Good things: Props, costumes and in particular sets were generally excellent the mise en scene was altogether perfect.The story was generally quite good, the script wasn't late and some of the dialogue was... well... just naff and stupid but the plot expertly worked into all Anne Rices novels shone through.It had vampires in it and i do love vampires.Bad things: The acting was poor, the main actor playing Lestat (is it Stuart Townsend?) seemed to think he was playing a cross between a Gothic American school boy and a classic Dracula but Lestat isn't either. The performance lacked the sense of unique angry insanity brought to it by Tom Cruise in Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire' now ordinarily i wouldn't dream of saying such a thing about Tom Cruise but we all have to make exceptions and he played Lestat to perfection.The ending was Hollywood not Anne Rice, it all seemed it end rather suddenly in a dark Indiana Jones sort of way. In a dramatic final scene with serious over-kill as far as visual effects are concerned Lestat saves the day.I swear Lestat has had a personality change! In 'Interview-' he was so... flawed with no care for human life and yet here he practically becomes Louis and it doesn't suit him.That character: Jesse, she annoyed me and i don't know why she just did.Overall: It's worth watching but nothing about it exceeds Interview with the Vampire so don't expect anything nearly as good.",Queen of the Damned
113,mushrom,"For a vampire movie, it sucked :P",1,11 September 2002,"I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed.  Being a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was ""how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?""Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it.  If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.What we loose is a very important piece of Lestat's character.  His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.Also important to the story is that we loose the ""Story Of The Twins"", which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires.  And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.Even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story.  For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics).  But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female.  While I am sure many men object to the ""gayness"" of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way.  For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.And the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast.  At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet.  Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period.  Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself.  And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle.  I think that is a huge shame.  Is like seeing ""Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs"".Overall, the movie I thought was really bad.  About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack.  Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows.  Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.In ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned.  It is obvious now why this was.  It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.",Queen of the Damned
114,pnc777,"The book is always better than the movie,",8,22 February 2002,"however, with this movie, it is quite different.  I rushed to screen this movie with the excitement of a kid...and well, it wasn't quite what I thought.  First of all, there are MAJOR differences in the movie, like how Maurius supposedly fathered Lestat (a flashback) which, in the book he was friends with Maurius..he was fathered by someone else.  The ending happens in a different way, and the characters have much different qualities than those of the book.  Basically, the plot is KIND-OF the same...but as far as the characters, they should have changed the name of the movie along with the name of the characters and it might have a chance in the movie theaters. The way it is, however, is going to upset quite a few Anne Rice fans, me included.  The visual effects are exciting, but in a few places, it gets really grainy.  I feel that the character Lestat needed more background..which is WHY there was a book in between Interview with the Vampire and The Queen of the Damned.  There was much too much emphasis on on making the bad guys seem somewhat scary and not enough on development of characters and actual plot.  I have to say that Stewart Townsend tried, however, in his failure, I hope he realized that he tried TOO hard to seem cold hearted.  The frequent head movements reminded me of junior high girl fights...with the chicken neck and everything.  Marguerite Moreau however, was wonderful here.  I think she portrayed her character very well and was, to me, quite convincing until the end.  The settings were VERY well done, just like something out of a dream, and it was beautiful.  Alliyah's last performance was ground shaking.  She was most convincing and actually seemed to become the queen, Akasha.  However, there are some questions I have about the movie's vampire rules.  I mean, every movie has to have them...just what are their limits?  And their clothes seem to have a physical connection to their bodies...I would love that to be explained.  All in all...don't go in with much expectation...and you'll love it...that, or see the movie, THEN read the book.  I think you will enjoy it more.  The camera angles were interesting...some different techniques.However, the rotating room/box is boring and they could have done better.  I mean, does a vampire's hair flow down his back when he's upside down?  Just curious.Don't take kids to see this movie, please.  I know, I'm one of those parents who take my kid to movies that are not meant for his age, and even though he is much more mature than most, I refused to take him, and I'm glad I did. It was gory at times, and unnecessarily bloody most of the time.  It's been done before, but I wanted to go home with more than I did.  Oh well.  I WOULD recommend going to see it, to judge for yourself, but don't expect much and you will walk out happy.",Queen of the Damned
115,cng777,The mother of all Vampire Movies,8,16 March 2002,"I am not quite sure where to start with this movie.  It seems like this movie fills in a lot of holes as far as how one becomes a Vampire; willingly or victim.I thought the story line of 'Queen of the Damned' was pretty good.  I was really into the idea that Lestat was a rock star.  The way the concert scenes were shot from a bird's eye view really gave the feeling that he was a true rock star, and he was the star of the movie, not Aaliyah, who played her part exquisitely.  It's just a shame how she didn't live to see her work on the Big screen. Her part was very little but she played it well.  She seemed very into it.  I noticed that about Aaliyah, in her other movie.  She really gets into her parts.  The movie, in the beginning, was slow, but it picked up quickly.  The action started and the film suddenly became really exciting.I think what made it exciting for me was Lestat and the relationship he ended up having with the girl who was obsessed with him.  It was kind of romantic, because she died for him,to be with him; and she knew she would have to become immortal to be close to him.So,overall the movie really turned out to be about love and what people do for love.",Queen of the Damned

The dialogue is abominable, the acting even worse. I feel so bad that this is what the film career of Aaliyah will end with. She only has about 3-4 lines and her acting, well, she was a great singer.

117,ambimom,"Fine Cast, Lousy Script, Bad Editing, Great Special Effects!",4,14 March 2003,"Unless you have already read, as I have, each volume of the vampire chronicles written by Ann Rice, there is no way this movie makes any sense. It's a shame too because it's a fantastic cast that is totally wasted. Stuart Townsend (""About Adam"") one of the sexiest screen presences in many years, plays Lestat as if he were impersonating Larry Hagman doing J.R. Ewing. I suppose the reason for his performance is shame about accepting money for it. He looked as if he couldn't wait for this movie to wrap. Victor Perez, another fine actor with enormous sex appeal who was devastatingly touching and heroic in ""Indochine"" seems equally embarrassed to be in this turgid mess. The homo-erotic connection between Lestat and Marius in Rice's novel of the same name might have been powerfully kinetic in the hands of these two sexy actors, but this movie cares more about admittedly stunning special effects showing bodies self-immolating. Akasha's hand in that is explained in the novel but not here, nor is Jesse's fascination with Lestat ever explained, or the reason for the Talamasca or the importance of Maharet (played by the always wonderful Lena Olin). These are important recurring themes in Rice's vampire chronicles that drove the novel, ""Queen of the Damned.""  Without them, the final coupling of Jesse and Lestat makes no sense at all or anything else, come to think of it. If Ann Rice was upset about Tom Cruise playing Lestat, I can't imagine what she thinks about this mess.",Queen of the Damned
118,deamond9,Could have been better,6,21 December 2006,"The movie is alright, but I got the feeling that they HAD more story but didn't use it. Seemed like there wasn't enough plot. Especially when compared to Interview With The Vampire. The first movie had a complicated story with three dimensional, complex characters. This one didn't.In the commentary, the director mentioned and explained all the various changes he made between the book and the movie. But it seemed like almost every single change he made would've made the movie better.Example; in the movie, LeStat has short brown hair, which is both inaccurate to the book and contradicts the first movie. Especially since vampires can't cut their hair: this was not only established in the last movie but was actually a plot point during Kirsten Dunst's tantrum.There was another vampire who sired LeStat but he has REALLY short hair, again, vampires can't cut their hair. And in the book, apparently, he had LONG GREY hair.The Queen of the Damned herself had been petrified, and is first seen as a statue, but was reanimated by blood. In the book, her clothes, jewelery and hair were still real. This would've made allot more sense. In the movie whatever petrified her turned her gold jewelery and her cloth garments to stone, too, and these things are also turned back into gold and cloth by blood.The only change I'm not complaining about is her skin. The Queen of the Damned, like Cleopatra, was not actually of Ejyptian blood, but was white. She looks fine as she is.",Queen of the Damned
119,avidnewbie,Better Than Expected Less Than Hoped For,6,11 March 2014,"First off let me say that I have never read either of the books that this movie was inspired by. In fact Memnoch The Devil is the only Anne Rice Book that I've ever read. However, after watching Queen of the Damned for the first time now, nearly 12 years after is release, I am intrigued by it's premise and will make time to go back and read both books. As for the movie, it is a middling affair. There are many positives, among them are Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat, Aaliyah as Akasha, fantastic songs written specifically for the movie and a few stylistic flourishes here and there. I absolutely bought in to Lestat's hard rock persona. On a lesser note I couldn't help but make involuntary comparisons to Interview with a Vampire. Needless to say THAT is a better movie. Yet this movie could have been much closer in quality had some more elaborate choices been made in regards to special effects, a moodier screenplay and a greater focus on detail in general. There is absolutely zero tension or suspense in this film in thanks partially to it's metal music overload. I like the songs yet I feel that the dramatic scenes would have been better served with a more brooding or sinister soundtrack. Also, the climax was a bit rushed or underwhelming or trivialized. Not bad though.",Queen of the Damned

121,katana_one,"Not that bad, but not that great either.",5,20 February 2002,"I saw this film last night at a free sneak preview. I have to say that while I was entertained, there were some things about the film I did not like.1) The acting is sub-par all around. Aaliya may have been a gifted musician (I'm not familiar with her music, so I don't know), but she was a horrible actress. Townsend was not much better. Considering that these two are the top-billed cast members should prepare you for the lackluster performances from the rest of the cast.2) I have never read any of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"" so I don't know what specifically was cut out for the screenplay. What I do know is that they obviously cut out too much. There is too much that is not explained adequately on screen. It was plainly apparent that many sub-plots had been deleted, and therefore, a lot of potential was wasted.3) The score, in several places, became an annoyance as the music ""dramatically"" elevated to a piercing screech that only made me wince in pain.4) The eye makeup of the vampires in the movie made me wonder how they have managed to stay secret for so long, being that they all look alike. They all had the exact same discoloration at the corners of their eyes (near the nose). Visually, it was very distracting and failed at making the vampires look otherworldly - it looked more like that crud that forms in the corners of your eyes while you're sleeping.Now, all that being said I feel the movie is not a complete waste of time. Aaliya, while not a great actress, is certainly pleasing to the eye. And there is enough action and special effects to keep the lukewarm plot going until the end. See it at an early matinee and save a little cash.I gave it a 5 (out of 10).",Queen of the Damned
122,wiredrabbit,"The more I think about it, the less I like it",1,7 March 2002,"When first I saw it, I did find a few things I liked.  The attitude of the producer was not one of them.  His past as a studio exec haunts this formula driven film.  The music was OK, if a bit done - I love industrial music, but would have liked something new.  The concert scene was the worst.  What was up with all the plastic props?  OK, so you found a few Goths on the street and you think that qualifies you.  I got so sick of hearing them say they were ""Goth""  Not that I would claim the sickening title, I just like black and hang out in basement clubs.  Obviously the creative director of this movie didn't.  First, Industrial does not equal Goth.  Second, where was the dark, beauty?  And everything else about the lack of continuity is true. The only people who like this film are Aaliyah fans who get off on seeing her squirm in a bikini.  But she doesn't even do that much.  And what is with the accents?  After thousands of years you figure she could learn not to lisp through the teeth?  And wouldn't hundreds of years old vampires have some power and intelligence.  Lestat comes across poorly, but Marius is the worst.  They do show him to be an accomplished painter, but gloss over the reason why and there is no other hint than any of the characters might actually have lived for some time.  Isn't that the appeal of Vampires? Eternal life and all the benefits?  This movie was a poor Hollywood standard action flick trying to stuff in too much intelligence.  Somewhere along the line they should have made the choice between compelling drama and action. Instead the achieved neither.",Queen of the Damned

They basically reinvent relationships and mix and match plot points between the characters so they are faithful to the books in name only. Even if you haven't read the books, the movie is just too much of a mess to recommend. The plot jumps around randomly, characters are cardboard, acting is rather feeble, and it feels much longer than the 90 minutes running time. Many of the major characters from the books (Pandora, Armand, etc.) are not even referred to once by name. They were badly cast and the only fun I had was to guess who they're supposed to be. Aaliyah was channeling Bela Lugosi as Akasha, that's was funny. So, why did I even give it 3 stars instead of 1. Well, at least it doesn't look cheap, that deserves one star. The special effects on the vampire movement is pretty cool and interesting, that's another star.

She not only played the role of Akasha she became it.  Her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well.  It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian Queen (No, I'm not predjudice against white people, I am one).  True it's not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were but this was a nice change.  Stuart Townsend completely made me forget about Tom Cruise's portrayel of Lestat and Marguerite was striking once again.  All in all it was a good time at the movies.

126,bigbadjohn-46034,An Outstanding Vampire Movie,10,5 June 2019,This movie was entertaining to watch but as I have not read the books that it is based on I cannot comment on the changes that were made. That said despite Ann Rice and some critics not liking the movie I found it to be a movie that had a well written script. The actors especially Aalieyah who had the potential to be a great actress based on her performance did an outstanding job in their roles.The musical score and the cinematography along with the special effects were just outstanding. Also the DVD that I watched had a commentary track which is worth listening to along with deleted and extended scene plus making of featuettes all of which are worth watching,Queen of the Damned
127,NYKMarin8161,Using Aaliyah's memory for the wrong thing,1,27 June 2003,"** some spoilers**   Queen of the Damned was a disappointing film. I saw it in anticipation to see Aaliyah's last appearance in a film. I also thought the story of a vampire becoming a rock star was interesting. Aaliyah's character, Akasha, had a few appearances as a cold marble statue. But to see Aaliyah in action, you would have to wait until most of the movie unfolds. When Aaliyah actually appears, she gets only 2 minutes in the friggin' movie. The scene where she goes into the vampire hang out spot and kills every vampire in the joint was pure entertainment. It actually gave the movie a boost but before you know it the movie is ending and Aaliyah's character is killed off. Here's some advice, if you are naming a movie after the alias of the character, give her some time in the film. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) gets much more time. They are busy showing how he became a vampire and his success has a rock star. Aaliyah is a good actress, she actually had high hopes after her appearance in Romeo Must Die. In Queen of the Damned, Aaliyah's name is basically used to bring in the dollars and her acting is wasted. This was a poor choice by Warner Brothers and the Village Roadshow production company.",Queen of the Damned
128,pigletgirlkp,More like Lestat,6,3 July 2005,"I read all the books after seeing Interview with a Vampire and still to this day go on tangents about how poorly they cast Lestat in that film. I was a little scared of seeing this because of that but my fears went away after one look at Stuart Townsend. This man was born to play a vampire and played Lestat like he knew him intimately. I put aside the small differences in appearance and fell in love with the sharp wit that I have learned to embrace from this, unfortunately fictional, character. The movie was not named right and I was surprised that Anne Rice let the screenwriter change so much of the background story. Anyone who loves the chronicles will be able to sit and make a list starting with Lestat's real sire and the non-existent twins never mind the choice for Akasha, which WAS well performed. The movie is mostly Lestat (the book) but turns into a summarized version of The Queen of the Damned. If you are not a big fan of the chronicles of have not read them it won't matter to you. The story is good and the cinematography is top notch and Best part of all...Stuart Townsend is shirtless through most of it (which in my opinion could make a lesbian straight.) In short one of the best vampire movies but the novels are still better.",Queen of the Damned
129,A Jay,At least Aaliyah was good,3,16 March 2003,"It's a shame that the talented Aaliyah died just after principal photography was complete, because had she lived she could have put this mess behind her. Not criticising Aaliyah at all, she was good as Akasha and she made me give this movie 3 rather than 1. The rest of the film is terrible, Stuart Townsend is a really bad choice for Lestat.Tom Cruise made the character his own in Interview with the Vampire and Townsend completely changes the way the character was. Lestat was a cold blooded killer and was still happily killing at the end of the last film. Are we supposed to believe that because of rock music he somehow reconnected to his human side. Some of the music was just about ok to listen to, but it's not life changing. If the names weren't the same you really couldn't connect Queen of the Damned to Interview with the Vampire at allI haven't read the source material, but I do believe that in the book Lestat becomes a rock star. In my opinion that was a rubbish idea to begin with. Maybe the film makers should have just got permission to use the characters names then make up their own story instead.",Queen of the Damned

Face it, Rice fans. The project had SO many things working against it, mainly because QUEEN starts in the middle of a complicated story. The clever screenwriters managed to condense Lestat's history, blend in the Queen story, and (thankfully) reduce the unnecessary complexities of Jesse's psychic links to Ancient Egypt.  (Reality check: INTERVIEW didn't profit enough for Hollywood to gamble on a two-part film; this was before the RINGS trilogy and KILL BILL). But hey, this film has a pair of KILLER PERFORMANCES by Townsend and Aliyah, stylish direction, a cool score, and a fast pace that THIS Rice fan, at least found VERY satisfying.

132,wolfcub7,"This is a film that ""was never meant to be"".",3,14 July 2010,"As an independent film, this is almost entertaining, but more a pain. Let me explain first, why you shouldn't trust this as an adaptation of the novels by Anne Rice. The film makers think they stayed true to the spirit of the books. But how could it be possible, if they don't respect anything about the books?Most of the original character's personalities are totally altered or reversed; especially Jesse has no personality characteristics in common with the novel version what-so-ever. Lestat, who in the novel is joyous and happy, and becomes a rock star ""to see what happens"" and to do good for the world by revealing secrets of evil... is suicidally depressed in this film!! Marius is aggressive and cold, though in the novels he is very loving and gentle, especially with Lestat, and would never ever do some things he does in this film. Does that sound like sticking to the books's spirit and adapting the books's characters into a story adapted from the books?But then, what the heck, they also completely rewrote the ""guts"" of the story - the producers himself uses that phrasing about the matter. Completely rewriting something that crucial, isn't adapting. ""Rewrite 'the GUTS' of the story"", says the producer. Tthat is in other words 'multilating the insides'. As in, butchering. They butchered the books and they admit it! They just don't give flying *beep* about it! But still, they talk about the production as if it was adapting type and this film is unfairly advertised as ""Anne Rice's"" though pretty much only the names are in common with her work. It's very misleading for others and very infuriating for some of the passionate The Vampire Chronicles fans, who usually are already dropping heads for the butcher in itself.I find it funny the producer complained about ""information overload"" as for why they couldn't stay more loyal to the books - yet they waste half of the film on something that wasn't in the book(s) at all. I'm talking about the so called ""romance"" between the characters Lestat and Jessica.Those minutes they could've used for real information from the books, on the Queen of who the title is about and the vampire history. Not only is that history important but it would've also given a lot of awesome atmosphere for this film as a vampire film as well. But even without this actually does work. You are only left to use your own imagination and speculations, which should not be all that bad thing.I think some changes they made good and working perfectly for the film since they were not really adapting the books anyway. They changed the person who makes Lestat into a vampire - that change just serves the film's limited amount of minutes so well, and even for the characters that was perfect. Even when comparing to the novels. (I have in-depth analyzed Lestat and that character's relationship in the novels, for two years.) This film however lacks showing how excellent substitute maker he is, because they abused the original characters' personalities.)Can't compare Townsend and Cruise as Lestat. They had completely different scripts in their hands: Cruise had a wonderful script helped by the author herself. Townsend has a horrible mess of a butcher from a production that literally told Anne that they'd do whatever they want. And since that was a story completely different than in the books, it wouldn't have made any difference if Townsend had read the books. It's the story what makes the character who it is. But it's undeniable that Tom Cruise did put 100 times more passion into his portrayal, than Townsend did. But ST still makes a very fine Gothic rock star vampire and showed potential for a true Lestat in the very few in-character moments that were left for him in the film.As an independent film this is a pain because it's full of old clichés, which however could be bearable if only they had a logic storyline & relationships there, but it's all utter nonsense! Above all the Lestat/Jesse ""paiting"" they have there. Lestat clearly hates the woman and has every reason to, and he doesn't even imply at any point that he'd be interested in her in any emotional way - actually at all as a person. I don't know what the film makers were smoking when they made the certain two scenes, which had NO realistic development into them. In fact, one of them had a moment that totally contradicts something very crucial that Lestat had said in the same scene, like 5 seconds earlier! WTF!? I repeat; I don't know what the writers were smoking. And why there is no realistic development for the Lestat/Jesse relationship, is because the characters had NO romantic nor sexual chemistry what-so-ever, while they also meet only twice before the ending and they're both loaded with negative emotion from Lestat's side.This works well as a vampire movie in general - but if you want to introduce yourself to Anne Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" and ""The Vampire Lestat"" - this film is not the way. If you do not know the books, and can ignore utter nonsense, you're probably the one enjoying this the most. And if you are a fan of the book - do keep open mind and think before you judge.The cast; everyone are great in their roles. They would've just deserved more true versions of their characters! I especially love Stuart Townsend as Lestat and Vincent Perez as Marius. The atmosphere of this film is darkly romantic. The music is hooking.Pick this film if you like vampires and you don't have anything else but this and Twilight at hand. Because, the two are the worst you could waste your time with, but this one is superior to Twilight, as this has actually vampires in this.",Queen of the Damned

Why they even bothered to use the names of Anne Rice's vampires at all is beyond me. A blonde Armand (I had to read the credits to see who that vampire was). Pandora and Mael bursting into flame, are you serious?  The movie was so far from the book that they should have named it something else like. ""Vampire Woman Arises for all of 10 minutes"".I tried to watch it as a stand alone movie but Stuart Townsend was the most unconvincing vampire I have seen on screen, he didn't look like the uncaring, emotionally void Lestat at all he looked like he couldn't wait for his scenes to be over and his voice for the character was worse than his acting.OMG, they turned it into a LOVE story. How pathetic trying to appeal to a teenage romance audience. The biggest farce after watching this on a borrowed friends DVD was listening to the comments of the directors/cast/whoever,  trying to justify why there were so many changes (I borrowed it to specifically to listen what the director had to say for himself).There just wasn't enough time to show this or that, was the biggest excuse.

Like Interview With a Vampire, the story was chopped into bits, spit on and layed out in disney sub-realistic mode. I was confused most of the movie as it was contrary to most of her books, and even the movie Interview (where they drain people, but here they aren't allowed to). What dissapointed me more than anything else was the fact that they left out her entire theory on the origins of vampires and the story of the ancients (they didn't even name most of them, but they were all there at the end) I, personally, was very dissapointed. Although I am glad that my friends did enjoy it...none of them have read the books.",Queen of the Damned

The acting was poor, but it didn't really matter.  The movie could have starred Orson Wells and Katherine Hepburn and it still would have been one of the worst movies ever made.If you want a good vampire movie, check out ""Dracula"" and ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn"".

Even most of the loser goth kids who it was targeted for don't seem to like it.The whole concept is just utterly ridiculous...A vampire who is the lead singer of a nu-metal band. Thats what it's about. Just think about that for a few seconds. Take some time to process the thought. A vampire...singing...in a (crappy) rock band...What the HELL were the people who made this movie thinking? I've never read the books so I don't know how similar the 2 are, but if the premises were the same, I officially hate Anne Rice.I was actually laughing at how awful this movie was. The ""action"" scenes were so over-the-top-matrix-wannabe that it was just too pathetic for words. Worse than that were Lestat's lame attempts for a ""shrouded in mystery"" pretense.It's not good in a bad way either if you were maybe thinking it might be. I can't understand how people rip on Uwe Boll so much (not that he doesn't deserve it, because he does) but I don't hear this atrocity mocked nearly as much as it should be.Don't even watch out of curiosity. 1/10 (I wish it could be 0)",Queen of the Damned

142,KittyGrimm,Not for those who've read the books...but enjoyable,6,19 April 2008,"I'll be honest, I do admit to actually watching this film and enjoying it even after reading the books, mainly because I saw the film first and was glad that it didn't spoil the books. It is a big guilty pleasure of mine, but I will grant that now reading most of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and I also will grant that it about as faithful to them as ""300"" was to history, but once you put the books aside and forget all about them, it's a decent film to say the least.Many fans have despised this film for butchering the books and some actually enjoy it because it had introduced them to the books in the first place (as it did to me), but personally I think it would have done a good job as a film if it was just in chronological order and faithful to the book. For example, Stuart Townsend has been criticized for is performance as he wasn't playing the character of Lestat from the books. Frankly, I think Townsend could have played a good Lestat if he wanted to, seeing him in other films where he had done a good job, but clearly the writers had different ideas. Needless to say, the film would have been good if it had either a different title and different names or was at least faithful to the book. But apparently, the writers had only looked up a fair few pages of the books and thought that was a good idea.But there are some good points to the film: The soundtrack is brilliant, Vincent Perez (Marius) appears to be the only one in character, Lena Olin is wonderful as Maharet (despite her lack of blindness, let alone a twin sister) and although Townsend does not play the twisted and humorous side of Lestat, he does add the seduction, arrogance and edginess that Tom Cruise did not have. After all, it might be hard to take Tom Cruise seriously as a rock star lip- syncing to Korn, though he did do a brilliant job in the original first installment of the chronicles on film. And to my astonishment, I watched the film in French for practice not too long ago and Lestat was a lot more in character when dubbed in French...very strange.Anyhow, yes, on a whole the film does little to no justice to the books, but it is enjoyable if you're bored and in need of something semi-dark or if you're in need of an introduction to the books to get a taste of what they're like. Although, the books, to me, are almost unfilmable since they are filled with rather heavy metaphysical matters.",Queen of the Damned
143,jlongstreth-1,Utter garbage,1,1 April 2009,"I had some time to kill, and being a fan of the books, decided to watch this. I'd heard it was bad, but had no idea how much worse than the rumors it actually was.Bad acting, bad music, bad cinematography. Laughable special effects. Incomprehensible plot. The list goes on. It was as if the director decided to pander to the MTV generation's Goth base, but instead, insulted their intelligence and aesthetics at the same time. That's a good trick, right there. The movie is like a 103 minute music video for a Godsmack-inspired Monkees.If you are a fan of Anne Rice's books, you will hate this movie for the massive changes to the story arc. If you have not read the books, you will not understand the story. My recommendation? Don't even bother with it.",Queen of the Damned
144,epichiphop,Not the worst,6,4 March 2019,Not the worst vampire horror film. Definitely some shoddy acting but I loved the soundtrack and Aaliyah was amazing (RIP),Queen of the Damned
145,suburbannightmare,"oh dear, oh dear, oh dear....",3,3 November 2006,"This is the most recent adaptation of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Lestat has arisen after a hundred years of 'sleep' to become a rock star. His music reveals names and secrets of Vampires the world over, enraging the entire vampire community. Akasha, the mother of all vampires, has been awoken from her sleep by Lestat's music. She decides to make him her consort and resume her rule as Queen of the Damned.Firstly, Michael Rymer needs to be chased naked through nettles by a pack of rabid dogs. Secondly, When Anne Rice offers to do your screenplay for free, ACCEPT! Then you might end up with something that amounts to more than a prolonged music video for a very bland and childish character. And that's what Stuart Townsend's Lestat is. Yes, he's gorgeous, and OK, his Creole accent's passable, but how do you follow on from one of the most amazing portrayals of Anne Rice's most beloved vampire? Quite simply you don't. (Tom Cruise spoils it for everyone again.) Bit of a shame, because Townsend does have his moments. He is very slick and sexy in the music video segments of the movie, but with dialogue as inane as this screenplay's it's hard to make a character believable when he spouts idiotic lines like ""Boo Back"" not much of the sensuality, egotism or charm of the original character remains in this version  this time around, Lestat is a whiny, tantrum-throwing angry young man. And there's a big difference between hammy acting and lack of talent. So it's a bit of a shame the whole movie centres around him, really.Aaliyah's portrayal of Akasha is good, although she unfortunately does little more than squint in a sinister way, belly dance about in a small metal bra and set other vampires on fire. Aaliyah's acting  dodgy Egyptian accent aside  is probably the best in the movie, but again, she's that underused that her character loses her menace. After a while she's just this pissy bitch who wants her own way all the time. Which is a true shame as her motives in the book do actually have a point. And to say this movie's title is Queen Of TheDamned, said Queen is curiously shoved into the sidelines, and the movie becomes more about Lestat's rise to rock superstardom and his moral struggles. Akasha's attempt to regain her rule over the world of Vampires is almost an afterthought.The rest of the vampire alumni included in this movie were, on paper, really rather exciting (for a vampire novel-reading geek like me). Marius, Maharet, Mekare and Armand are all included (apparently) but harshly overlooked, and dismissively underused. No time is spent on these characters at all, despite them all being some of the most important in the story and for those who haven't read the books, there's probably a certain amount of who-the-hell-are-these-guys?-syndrome happening. It's almost like the writers took a pair of garden shears to the book, put it through a blender and then filmed what was left. Yes, the sets, costumes and makeup effects are good, the Death Valley concert scene is well done, but the whole movie dithers about for 97 minutes, unsure as to whether it's following the' Queen of the Damned' or 'The Vampire Lestat' plot lines. A tad ambitious I feel. And look what happened. The movie falls flat on its face with all it's glamour, black leather, body piercings and tattoos in a heap around it. And I just want to stand pointing and laughing.",Queen of the Damned

And I swear, as much as I hated it then, it was just a pathetic mess this time around.
If you've read the books.. prepare to be sorely disappointed.
Lazy writing, basic cable grade special effects, and lackluster acting made this painful to revisit. Even more so when you realize this was Aaliyah's final performance.. and although hers is one of the better performances, it's not enough to make this watchable. Even Twilight managed to feign a plot... it's a shame that the superior book ended up being an inferior film to that rotting pile of ridiculousness.",Queen of the Damned
148,jamalhugo,"Entertaining, nothing more....",6,24 December 2009,"First of all, I found ""Queen of The Damned"" to be extremely different from ""Interview with The Vampire"" probably because of all the special effects and difference in actors. As I watched the movie the plot was quite simple and easy to understand, as well, there was not much suspense at all or the creation of curiosity. In no way was the film as powerful or emotional compared to the last film (Interview with The Vampire). I had expected more from it by seeing the trailer. The acting was okay, but the last film had some of the best and most well-known actors so once again if I compare it, it would not be as good. The ending was quite predictable. It seemed to me it was one of those movies you watch just to be entertained and not to make you think what so ever really. I didn't quite like it being at some points a dark movie, it was done in my opinion to make the viewer uncomfortable (not sure if that makes sense). Overall it wasn't that much a waste of time.",Queen of the Damned

150,esther70,Not a bad vampire movie for non-Anne Rice fan,7,2 February 2019,"I am a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, at least the first 6 or 7 books. So, I could understand why many fans hated Queen of the Damned. It took away what made each vampire unique, making them a bunch of power rangers fighting a common enemy, Akasha. Lestat also faced danger as he disregarded the ancient rule of secrecy of vampires among humans. Unlike the Interview with the Vampire, this is not a character building movie that tells the origin of Lestat & his clan. It is a fight for survival movie, like from Dusk till Dawn.
I guess the main problem with the fans was that the book Queen of the Damned was indeed an origin movie and introduced the all the ancient ones. However, at least in the Queen of the Damned, they got most of the look of the ancient ones right. Unlike in Interview of the Vampire where Armand was no where near what he looked in the book, and his wig was a pure horror.
Despite not dyeing his hair blond, Stuart Townsend nailed Lestat's attitude much better than Tom Cruise. Aaliyah's Akasha was exotic, beautiful and dangerous.

Is there anything more tiresome than the whole goth-vampire cliche?  We've seen it all before, folks, and there's nothing new here. Aaliyah manages to light up the screen for a very short time, but is given very little to do... a sad note for her career to end on.  There is no atmosphere, no real tension, and none of the sensuality that made ""Interview with a Vampire"" such a pleasure.  This isn't even a sequel, having one inconsistency after the next from the first film, but rather a cheesy, midnight-movie knock-off.

156,Hypnotica,"I guess it depends on your point of view, but I think it's good",10,24 November 2004,"I'm notorious among my loved ones for my love of movies that most people wouldn't like. I'm blessed with a gift to appreciate them, I guess. And I'm also blessed with the ability to take movies as totally separate from their book counterparts. Die hard Ann Rice fans might not like this movie because it slams two books (The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned) into one to make a relatively short film. So, obviously, a lot of the story was changed or left out. Which makes it understandable why some were upset. I mean, come on, Interview With the Vampire was over two hours long, and it was the movie version of just one book.However, taken as it's own story, the movie is actually very good. Well, in my opinion. Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat is wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that he takes off his shirt quite a bit (he has a really nice, defined, if lean, body) and wears leather pants quite a bit. He also has the rock star quality that is often missing when most actors play musicians. You can see how into the music he is. He also is able to project Lestat's arrogance and loneliness very well.Vincent Perez, who plays Marius, also does a wonderful job. Though quite popular in Europe, he is sadly under-appreciated in the U.S. I can't honestly say that his portrayal was dead on (so to speak) because I haven't read any of the books the character appears in, but I thought he was quite good. (Another one that is good-looking, ladies.)Akasha, unfortunately, displays very few emotions, so Aaliyah didn't get a chance to really showcase her acting talents in her final performance, but she did play the evil vampire convincingly. Since she was said to be quite pleasant in real life, I'd say her performance was excellent.Most of the remaining cast were also enjoyable, if not impressive in their performances.There are also interesting special effects.I loved this movie.If nothing else, you should at least check out the soundtrack. The songs are well penned and preformed by a number of talented musicians. My advice? At least give this movie a chance. Despite the bad reviews, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",Queen of the Damned
157,ailinon,Enchanting with the music and the mood.,9,3 April 2003,"The movie, although not faithful to the original novels, succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision. Somebody tried to insult QotD calling it a 1,5h music video clip. Actually it is a complement. The everpresent gothic music combined with the music-video-like shots made the movie so moody - and ""Queen of the Damned"" is a mood-driven story.I do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters had been lessened and I have no problems with changing Lestat's maker or skipping Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me.Actually, I think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, that was perfect to XIXth century New Orlean and Louis's angst, wouldn't fit Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well, the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic. ""Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" can be split into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something.Some of the special effects, like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing I actually didn't like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially on the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius though. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient-Egyptian accent.So if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios) ""Queen of the Damned"" is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. But please do not compare it to the ""Interview"" movie. It has a completely different style, precisely as much different as different were Louis and Lestat. Personally I find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from Louis' ""bottled hunger"" point of view, and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, Lestat.I'd give ""Queen"" 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown.",Queen of the Damned
158,NightoftheDawnoftheDayoftheDead,A Travesty,2,24 June 2003,"I'm a big fan of Anne Rice's vampire books.  Queen of the Damned is my least favorite of them all, however it is still a very good book, though slow in a few sections in my opinion, and that Queen is damned better than this damn Queen.Others have explained how this movie doesn't bother to follow the books so I won't dwell on that, but I wholeheartedly agree.  What the hell were they smoking when they wrote the script to this?  Or perhaps, since some drugs do make people more creative, (throw your music collection away if you don't think so) what WEREN'T they smoking?The only storyline gripe I'll go over here is all the vampires fighting Akasha at the end of the movie.  Those other vampires are MAJOR characters in the book.  They're given a glimpse of screen time in the movie.. all of a sudden the vampire posse you've seen 3 frames of previously shows up and wipes out the main villain who wasn't even in the movie much. (yes, I know she died, doesn't make the movie any better)  They really needed to at least introduce some of the other vampires before they came in to play the hero role.My biggest gripe with this movie is the soundtrack, and more specifically the garbage Lestat sings.  Why does Lestat suddenly turn into the guy from Korn when he sings?  Does that make ANY sense??  ANY?!?!  Besides, Korn is awful, and regardless of their talent, I don't exactly think of that when I think of something a vampire would sing.  I think maybe something similar to Type O Negative music, with NEW vocals, not just an existing band's song, may have fit a little better without sounding like glam rock, which is kind of what the book makes it sound like, and I think even that would work beautifully in comparison with the crap that comes out of Lestat's throat... oh sorry, I mean out of nowhere since it doesn't sound like Lestat or even close to it.This is pure tripe that was thrown together to take advantage of Vampire Chronicles movie rights, was made for a quick buck.  As a fan of the books I was insulted by the plot, and I don't think there would even be enough there for this thing to even make sense to people that haven't read the books.Avoid it.  Interview With the Vampire didn't follow the book 100% either, but it was beautifully filmed and retained the feel of the book.  This is crap.  Read the books The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned and you'll understand why, and you'll likely get a lot of enjoyment out of them in the process.",Queen of the Damned
159,Von_Stalhein,Uuuuh...,1,24 September 2009,"WWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL, let us see here. This might contain spoilers for anyone stupid enough to watch this.... movie? Let us start with the beginning. Lestat did not go ""to sleep"" in the 18th or 19th century and when he did he was still horribly wounded from being repeatedly stabbed, having his throat cut, being set on fire, and being thrown from a large tower. As I am a fan of the books this flick annoyed me so much I started shouting at the TV. As far as I know Lestat wasn't a fan of the goth genre. He was supposed to have risen in the 80s and was a ROCK star... not goth, not metal, not rap, but ROCK star, proper 80s rock. He wore denim and huge 80s sunglasses, rode a Harley Davison or a Porsche, which sadly got totalled but thats another story (that SHOULD have been in this movie). Thats the least of the flaws. As many here have stated, many characters and about 90% of the story and background has been cut out and probably sh*t on by the B-movie hacks responsible for this tripe. Even those characters that were wedged into the background were just nameless, funny looking freaks - i had to look up these people on the internet to find out who they were. The character of Armand looked more like Marius was supposed to look than the actual Marius character himself. AND, since when did Akasha have a semi Russian accent and an African heritage? The concert scene in the books was much more interesting than the awful spectacle in the movie. It was a nice touch that in a giant arena Lestat didn't need a microphone because of his powerful vampiric voice. Jesse was supposed to be severely injured at the concert too, having her spine smashed and it was Mael (the freaky old scarecrow guy in the movie) who turned her. Don't even get me started on the P!SS poor ending of this overzealous mtv ad because that was just a load of crapola!I'm gonna stop now because thinking about it is just angering up the blood.

This is the erotic and beautiful character that millions of people have fallen in love with.  Stuart Townsend shoots lightning bolts off of the screen.  He is sex personified.  If you want to watch Lestat explode off of the page and walk and talk onscreen, skip Tom Cruise and rent this movie.

This movie doesn't even come close to portraying the Chronicles' characters, and in fact doesn't even include some of the most important people, leaving you with a bunch of vampires who just happen to have some of the same names.On a light note, the soundtrack rocks, Lestat is looking delicious, and the over all scenery can be very beautiful. However, only the digital effects, makeup, and the music made this film even worth trying to satisfy one's curiosity.The movie itself is very unstable. The characters are confusing, and Lestat even has the wrong accent; he's supposed to be French, but in the movie he's Irish. The narration was retarded. I felt myself looking away a few times because I couldn't even watch, and just sitting there laughing the whole time at the movie's absurdity. Like Townsend said, it really is a cheesy film.If you've read the books, however, you're in for an inside joke with David and Marius.

After reading Queen of the Damned, the book written by Anne Rice, I was so ecstatic to be finally seeing the movie. But as the movie progressed, that ""ecstasy"" that I felt for the book turned into disappointment for this movie.BOOK vs MOVIE As we all know, whenever books are made into movies, most of those movies, are nothing like what they're supposed to be and this one is the same with them. It's really really different from the book. Its plot wasn't copied, I think that they just used the book for names and such. And also, the book is a masterpiece, compiled and put together by one of the smartest being on earth. If you were turned off by this movie and opted to not read the book, then you are so missing a very great chapter in your life!STORYLINE It was bogus. Anybody could make that up. A story where the main lead (ML) was lonely needed somebody, found that special someone (SS), said bogus line, but was caught in the net of someone, not quite beautiful but more of a s*** (S), if you know what I mean. Then S is bad who wants SS to die by the hands of ML who turns back on S. LOOOONG story short, SS and ML live happily ever 'till death do them part, which is unlikely since we ALL know that they live forever. EFFECTS I was expecting more, since hello, DUH!!! These are the Warner Bros. we're talking about! I mean a year before they made the greatest movie ever! Harry Potter with very, VERY awe-inspiring effects. Then we just get crappy burning effects and decomposing, audiences doubled in the concert arena and don't forget the flying and jumping and grabbing hold of their so-called victims. Oh wait, that last part when the spirit inside Akasha went out and it was like doing the atom-like movements around her, it was almost okay, almost that is.CHARACTERS If you are particular to the ""vampire"" world, authors would usually say that they are the most beautiful creature that roam the world, that wherever they go if not concealed turns heads around, not literal of course, but the only person who was beautiful was Lestat aka Stuart Townsend. Jesse (M. Moreau) was beautiful too, just that she was better looking when she was still alive and not in her vampiric state. I don't know what to make of their acting since I do not really know on how to judge it, but one thing's for sure, Stuart Townsend is the best looking vampire actor in the world who beats Edward(Rob Pattinson) hands down! And Townsend is better at acting too.TOTAL All in all, if you're intrigued, I'd rather you just watch it online, no need to get out of your house to go out and rent it for you're just wasting your time. But, as I've said before if you're interested about the whole queen rising up again and rocker vamp next to her, go and look for the book, it's worth it and there are tons of lessons to learn from this book. OTHER COMMENT I wish that they'd make another movie out of this. They'll follow the real sequence that was in the book, find more people who are pleasing to the eyes to play the parts of the vampire people. And that they use Townsend again to play as Lestat with his cool and angelic voice that sounds demonic which doesn't make sense but if you listen to him you'll understand.",Queen of the Damned
164,tinusa007,Music and vampires over storyline,6,15 January 2013,"I don't know why people assume that just because a movie is based on a book it has to have the same storyline. And it happens very often actually when someone makes a book adaptation we expect to see the characters as we imagined them and the background about them as well. But what we need to understand is that when someone bases the movie on a book, it only mean that they are going to use their names maybe some major storyline, they might even only use names and the fact that they are vampires. It doesn't necessarily mean that it have to be all the same as the book.That being said I have to say that as for the movie, it is not a masterpiece, but it did become a cult. Probably, it wasn't because of the script, but that doesn't change the fact that at least every goth or vampire loving person knows the movie and it is highly possible that he/her saw the movie. For me it was actually a nice easy going movie. I can watch any time. O actually saw the movie more than I can count. And to be honest I don't know why it has such a bad reviews all the time. I mean for Stuart Townsed was genius as vampire. And Jessee was great and Marius and the girl with violin. If you really think about it, it is very sentimental, romantic and about someone who is lost for so long and found by love at the end. It is so cliché and so predictable, but also it is very controversial, because of the music that is provided.I think you will all agree that QoTDhas one of the best soundtracks ever. For me personally it was a start of being addicted to that kind of music. It is shame that didn't find an actor who could actually sing, I believed Stuart when he was singing. I can't imagine for example Jonathan Davis to be Lestat even though he sings his songs. Also we had Chester from LP, Deftones or Marilyn Manson. It was really incredible. Or the violin parts, it has kind of ethereal feel to it. I think about the movie more as musical than a serious piece about vampires. At least they didn't sparkle and had fangs.",Queen of the Damned
165,Leiten,Queen of the Damned is amazing!,10,8 January 2005,"Stuart Townsend plays the role of Lestat better than anyone could have ever dreamt. Pale skinned, dark haired and red lipped, he does mysterious, intriguing, irresistible and evil all rolled into one. Aaliyah is not quite as wonderful. Although she wasn't bad, her acting was slightly wooden or way over the top and she should have stuck to the day job. (No offence.) This is an incredible movie with a great plot and generally stunning actors. The sets and costumes are just SO Gothic (obviously) and some of the scenes are breathtaking. It's one of those rare occasions where the sequel is actually better than the previous (Interview with the Vampire). A brutal tale with a happy ending. A perfect movie.",Queen of the Damned

The changes were terrible & it was like spot the bad Aussie actors.. Not mention the whole Marius made Lestat & the fact that David Talbot looked really young for an old guy in his 70's. The last scenes with all the vamps was interesting since unless you have read the books you would have no idea who they were suppose to be & that the ones that exploded really shouldn't have.,Queen of the Damned

It must have cost hundreds of thousands to add those to the movie.Lestat really had a good heart, and he demonstrated that by being ever so gentle and loving with Jessie, don't you agree? And in turn, she showed love and tenderness for him even before that much desired first bite....and he knew it instinctively. He truly ""made her,"" and she seemed so happy and so content to finally feel like she was where she belonged.I love happy endings, don't you?I recommend this highly--it's just the DVD to watch with a large crowd who appreciates tongue-in-cheek humor.

169,cjtoys,Stuart Townsend is a marvelous actor!,10,1 February 2005,"Stuart Townsend and Vincent Perez had good chemistry with each other. I enjoyed watching them act because they became the parts they played and were believable. I think this movie was visually more stunning than Interview with a Vampire. I like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, but as vampires they looked malnourished and seemed uncomfortable in their roles. I would like to see Stuart Townsend in the role of Lestat in future movies. I give QOTD a 10 for the music as well. But the soundtrack is performed by other artists and not the same singer as in the movie. Just listen to the DVD. I also recommend the DVD widescreen version over the full screen.",Queen of the Damned
170,SinisterDreamMaker,Much Better Then I Though It Was Going To Be.,8,14 September 2006,"When I saw previews for this I was thinking ""lame"" so I put off watching it for a while then I saw it on HBO and I'm not going to lie it is a good Vampire flick. On scale with other movies I mean yeah it is bad, but you really not need to get mad and fired up about it, just take it for what it is; a movie made for a certain group of people. Stuart Townsend is freaking brilliant as Lestat he really seemed like a vampire unlike Mr. Cruise who just played Lesat as himself...like he does in most of his movies. Aaliyah did a pretty good job, I think she got the feel of the character, but at the same time there was something missing. Keep in mind though Aaliyah was a singer trying out acting not a professional actress. Some of the lines where a little too predictable and stupid which over all just made the movie way too corny at parts when it really didn't need to be at all. I loved the movie soundtrack, I am a big fan of Korn, Deftones, and Static-X, Jonathan Davis did a good job composing the songs they had a believable feel that this is what a vampire who was bored with immortality and didn't care anymore would write about. They probably should not of had Davis sing for Lesat though his voice is just too recognizable it made way to obvious that Townsend wasn't singing. I'm sure they could of just had Townsend sing and messed around with it in post to make him sound good, and it would of seemed believable. If you like vampire movies like me and you like ""nu-metal""/goth rock like me you will probably like Queen of the Damned.",Queen of the Damned
171,banjogal,Lestat come out come out where ever you are...,7,22 February 2002,"Hahaha!  If you watch this film and pay close attention, Lestat's humor is right on target.  Its a good thing Louis didn't show up, he would have been a downer for the movie.  Sure there are things I missed that were in the books but I think Stuart Townsend's take on Lestat made up for it.  Whew, he can suck on my neck any night.  Remember this film is Lestat's story and don't expect Akasha (the late Aaliyah) to be in the majority of scenes and you'll come out feeling better about it.On Aaliyah's performance let me just say she did very well with what she had to work with.  She looked luscious and acted with regal abandon.I also enjoyed Vincent Perez as the ancient, Marius.  He seemed to be a combo of Marius and Armand as I envisioned them.  He certainly had Armand's playfulness and persistence.The script was weak in parts and some of the special effects were a bit cheesy (think of that scene in Interview with the Vampire where Louis is pissed off and chops Santiago in half and burns the Theatre des Vampires down) nothing monumental and a bit low end.  Oh well...My advice is, if you like vampires go see it, give it a chance.  Remember it is not Louis romantising via Anne Rice's pen and you'll enjoy it much more. Focus on Lestat and you'll be ready to surrender your mortality for a few sensuous minutes of life as an immortal rock star.Denise vv",Queen of the Damned
172,tliebe-1,"Overheated, Ridiculous, Often Utterly Insane - IT'S GREAT!",8,30 June 2021,"What you need to know is that this film is a mishmosh of the Anne Rice novel it's named after and the earlier book THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, and that Anne Rice has effectively disowned it -- which may be why it's so MUCH more entertaining than INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. Also, Lestat's played by Stewart Townsend, so you don't have Tom Cruise and his Black Hole-like power to make everything about HIM to deal with.What you have is Lestat becoming a rock star -- many of his fellow vampires want to see him dead because of that; his Sire Marius (Vincent Perez) is trying to protect him despite it; the Egyptian Progenitor Vampire Akasha, played by the late rock star Aaliyah, who's awakened from a LONG nap by Lestat's Rock&Roll and now wants him to sit by her side as her new Prince Consort... Oh, and a commune of loving, life-affirming Ancient Vampires headed up by Maharet (Lena Olin), who's as old as Akasha but isn't all evil and stuff, raised and is still watching over her human descendant Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), claiming to be her aunt!Confused? Don't go away, it gets crazier -- Jesse works for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, headed up by one of the lesser-known actors to be DOCTOR WHO (Paul McGann), who's fascinated by Marius. That's okay, because Marius is equally fascinated by The Doctor -- I mean, ""David Talbot!"", and wants him to come play in the deep end with all the vampires.Like I said in the title of this review, it's overheated (Aaliyah and Townsend don't walk so much as they writhe sinuously), the late Aaliyah's line readings are amateurish (though that could be due to her post-synch being done by her brother given she died shortly after production ended) as she projects all the Terrifying Menace of a Daddy's Princess trying to talk her way out of a speeding ticket, and the idea of New Agey Vampires (they literally have a Tree of Life in their main room!) is the stuff of camp.But... Townsend is an excellent Lestat (even if his singing's overdubbed by Johnathan Davis of Korn, who wrote Lestat's songs), Lena Olin's maternal warmth and strength sells the absurdity of her character, Marguerite Moreau is winning as the ""nice girl"" drawn to Vampirism, and the music really slaps. My wife refers to it as a ""rock and writhage"", and she's not wrong.If you're in the frame of mind for a gloriously silly vampire rock movie, and you don't worship at the altar of Anne Rice? This is definitely a movie you should watch at least once....",Queen of the Damned

They changed so much it's SCARY So much was changed they should have just renamed all the main characters. Its a lame Teen Flick. If you like cheesy B-Movies, this is probably your thing. Because the whole thing is a train wreck IMHO.One of the Worst book to film translations I have ever seen. Lestat in Love with Jessie, she is in the book for maybe 2 chapters, and the Twins are nowhere to be found are the center of the story. (Only Maharet is there...) Marius as Lestat's creator?!?!? A women with a violin?!?! what?!?! Leaving out Louis, Lestat's Mother, and Daniel, and Lestat having Brown Hair is a crime. Lestat's diary?!? LOL! Lestat would never keep diary, that was Claudia's diary in the book. AWFUL! I could list changes forever.Stewart is passive, forgettable and corny as Lestat (what is with the Dracula-ish accent!?!?!). And poor Aaliyah is completely sub-par to completely horrible to cheesy. The two main stars are below average. And the rest of the casting has got be some of the worst casting I have seen this year. I HATED Jessie, they turned her into a stupid teenager! Completely hated her character. She was a minor character in the book anyway (and not to mention she was 35 years old in the book).Vampire fans who have not read the books, might be kinda entertained.

Stuart Townsend does a wonderful portrayal of Lastat.  He looks SOOOOOO gorgeous in the movie as well.  There was something about the seductive way he moved and spoke that literally sucked me into the movie.  But it was Queen Akasha that stole the show! This role allowed Aaliyah to shine, even though she didn't get as much screen time as she deserved and that the film focused more on Lastat than the ""QUEEN OF THE DAMNED"". But besides all that, she did an amazing job of bringing Queen Akasha to life.  Aaliyah looks absolutely beautiful in this film, her natural beauty really stands out throughout the whole film. The music in the film is really awesome as well, but as I said before, the is movie rocks harder than the soundtrack! I give this movie a a HUGE thumbs up! I would also like to add that Aaliyah is greatly missed by all of her fans and she will be remembered not only for her beautiful voice, but also for the wonderful job in this film.

The special effects looked straight out of Xena Warrior Princess (when the vampires would fly around there was sort of a ""trails"" type effect--egads!). The Lestat character in this movie was not at all like the one in Interview. He seemed more of a Jim Morrison knock off, if you ask me. The acting was dull and the atmosphere was campy.

The lack of Aaliyah was reminiscent of the lack of Darth Maul in Star Wars Ep 1.  Disappointing.For a sequel to the very good Interview with a Vampire, this flick did not resemble its predecessor in any way shape or form.  Without the death of Aaliyah, this movie would have been straight to video.  Bad story, bad plot, bad special effects (the vampire speed shots were laughable).  A low budget bomb.

I've never really listened to her music but I'm guessing she stretched herself too thin, artistically.This movie was gawdawful; the fault largely resting with the paper-thin acting talents of the title character.

179,kicangel,"Anne Rice it ain't, good? I thought so.",10,14 April 2002,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Those of you going to see this film and expecting an exact copy of the book will be horribly disappointed. This is a story based on two books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned), and is one version of them. Parts have been changed, left out and not mentioned to give you a whole story and to fit in the time allowed.However, i REALLY enjoyed this film. I am a big fan of Anne Rice and the difference in the story didn't matter to me at all (e.g. one change being who sired Lestat). The settings were well constructed, and i could really see Lestat on the screen. I think that Stuart Townsend really caught Lestat's character, how he wants to exist in both the supernatural and the natural, much more than Tom Cruise did. I found that the people playing the vampire characters were like how i imagined, with only few changes there.Some of the acting by lesser characters was questionable, sort of stiff, but these are not on the screen long enough to really ruin the film.I especially liked how the movements were made to seem more supernatural than those of humans, some may call it flashy effects, but i think that it showed how different vampires are, especially in the 'feeding scenes'.The one thing i would warn against is for people not to expect normal vampire films, this is not Buffy or Blade. Those are made up of 'evil vampires kill good humans, so good humans kill evil vampires', this isn't like that. This film, and the book, are about how the vampires live, what happens to them, evil or good. This film, for me gave a feeling like that only one part of a long story had been told, which is how it should be, what with Vampires living forever.As i have said i really liked this film, which i was happy about since i had heard a lot of critics (mostly middle aged men who this film is not aimed at) say how bad and stupid it was. I think it was a good way of escaping to another world for a couple of hours, which is the whole point of films.

In the meantime I read the books, and was a little disappointed, though not dettered in the slightest.  Tonight my wait was finally over when I saw my long awaited sequel...  Despite Tom Cruise's fantasic performance as Lestat in Interview, I think Stuart Townsend did the character justice, while adding something Cruise couldn't have even tried to pull off.  It still retains the sensuality of the first film, though in a darker kind of way.

184,kaffee24,Great entertainment,9,16 May 2007,"This movie sits between all chairs: Too careless to please die-hard Anne Rice fans towards her epic novels, confusing all others who don't know them - even if you have seen the predecessor ""Interview with the Vampire"" to which Rice herself wrote the script.Starting but not stopping with Lestat, it mistreats characters who have become icons to fans: The mysterious Marius, Lestat's powerful maker, finds a rather sober incarnation in the short-cropped not-too-beautiful Vincent Perez (the haircut is okay for a classical Roman, but not in the all-out vain Rice universe!) Akasha, mother of all vampires played by the sexy Aaliyah, is not the least bit rusty in her ancient bones and could have been born yesterday - and what happened to her dark-feminist (book) plot to kill or enslave every male on the planet to stop humanity from destroying itself? Pandora and Armand are not even recognizable, but most of all the great Maharet (and her entirely left-out sister Mekare) whose story made up the red string of the novel is not a fraction as impressive as she could be. But then it would be a different film (one to which Rice would have written the script, supposing she didn't because of the above), and maybe one as dark and fraught with tragedy as its predecessor.Instead, this is thrilling, funny and sexy entertainment, and you won't leave the theater feeling depressed. I bought the soundtrack right away, but the music surely isn't to everyone's taste. The story focuses on Jessie of the Talamasca who tracks down Lestat and in the end is made a vampire by him (and they live together happily ever after). The prince of darkness appears more human than ever - bored by immortality, lonely and desperately reckless, this Lestat is dead only on the outside. He plunges into the remote-public guise of a rock star to draw out other vampires - ""better dead than alone"" is his motto. Their human-vampiric love affair starts out as mutual fascination with each other's boldness. While all back-row vampires in the movie are over-made-up caricatures, Aaliyah-Akasha is truly frightening - and very believable as a powerful, spoiled half-goddess that rips apart anyone she likes to, though not an old-Egyptian one (as far as we know, ancient queens didn't try to always act in the most sexy way).The end of the movie is the disappointing part - Maharet's ragged band of involuntarily funny creatures sucks beautiful Akasha dry, after traitorous Lestat has drained her enough for them to overpower her. She disperses in a cloud of golden dust, a special effects feast - but seems like it didn't take that much to get rid of her after all. More like a storm in a teacup, compared with Anne Rice's mountainous final struggle. So, 9 out of the 10 it would otherwise have been.I love Anne Rice's books, and I like the first film adaptation, but I think this movie has been treated unfairly in judging it by ""Lord of the Rings"" standards. The authors apparently thought that one and a half hours are not enough to deliver more than a snapshot of the ""Queen of the Damned"" epic, and they're right. So they based their version loosely on it and made up a new core of their own. Oddly enough this Lestat resembles the one in the novels very much, and Steward Townsend plays him with a funny snobby style full of self-irony that truly brings the voice from the pages to life.",Queen of the Damned

And my God, the role of the ancients was reduced to nothing. There is a deleted scene on the dvd when Maharet recruits them to fight the Queen, had this 1 scene been in the movie, it would have made a little more sense.

Anyway, he starts a hit rock band, but unfortunately, the QUEEN OF THE DAMNED wakes.

These guys couldn't get ANYthing right. example one: Lestat was sired by Magnus, NOT Marius. Marius sired Armand, who also didn't fit this role at ALL (Armand was the short, blond guy). And as opposed to IwtV (Where Lestat is played by Tom Cruise) Stuart Townsend didn't make a good Lestat. The only thing about him that really fit was his height (Which, incidentally, was the only thing the Cruise's performance DIDN'T have to make the perfect Lestat).

189,carlphillips1,Don't expect a lot from this one.,7,1 June 2005,"Despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books' main themes, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED/THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not stay true to Anne Rices's complicated story telling. The deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.However, there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the affect that Lestat (among other vampires)had to the public, especially young girls. The movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, though it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS, which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned book had that, and more.This movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. The effects are dull and very disappointing. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not how I pictured them in the book, and I think that many of them weren't even taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps itself up fairly neatly, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book).Somethings that I feel the movie needed include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; though I had no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction. The scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. I'd recommend this movie for people who has seen INTERVIEW or have read the books, so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption.",Queen of the Damned
190,jlcdwmartin,"Nice, fun, stand-alone vampire film",5,27 July 2016,"In comparing both ""Interview"" and ""Queen"", one can say definitely that Tom and Stuart both had an excellent time ""chewing up the scenery"".Who was the better actor to portray Lestat? Tom or Stuart? Let us be certain of one thing: Many different actors will play the role, just as in Shakespeare, over the centuries, different actors have portrayed Hamlet and Richard III.We know that Lestat was only about age 20 when he was turned into a vampire. I'll have to give the gold star to Stuart in that direction.One is often reminded of the comment by Maharet at the end of the novel ""Queen of the Damned"" to Lestat about writing his autobiography, ""Get it right"". Despite all the variances from the established plot line, I would say that both films capture the ambiance and the tension inherent in all of the first three novels of the Vampire Chronicles.In the movie ""Queen"", there is that telling scene where Lestat gives Jesse an ""op-ed"" practical example ""of what it is all about"", when in the park, he chases away the glasses-wearing vampire and takes the intended victim for himself.CHOMP!Good night! Pleasant dreams!",Queen of the Damned
191,fadestar,I knew that rock stars were vampires!,9,5 March 2002,"I saw Queen Of The Damned four times, and I  think I'm going to see it again. I really love this movie, and Stuart Townsend who plays vampire rock star Lestat just melts me like butter! Aaliyah was really good in the movie too, as Queen Akasha, the main villain. Some people have dismissed her acting because she was a pop star. But I think she can act better than Britney Spears and Mandy Moore combined.The best thing about the movie for me was the music, especially the songs ""Forsaken"" and ""Slept So Long"". Those songs would feel right at home on any modern rock station today, and the videos could play on MTV or any other music channel.There's a minor spoiler ahead:10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Serena Atschul of MTV makes a cameo appearance as herself, introducing a video for Lestat's band. Atschul also appeared in Josie and the Pussycats as herself, introducing that band's videos. It would be so funny and very twisted if Josie and the Pussycats and Queen of the Damned were in the same universe.",Queen of the Damned
192,glibchick,Terrible! A pain in the neck.,2,24 January 2007,"Being borderline obsessed with all things even remotely connected with vampires and Gothic art, I was thrilled when I heard ""Queen of the Damned"" had been made into a movie. If it was anything like ""Interview with the Vampire"" (which was pretty darn good, even though there might have been some deviations from the book), it had to be good stuff. For all those Anne Rice fans out there, prepare to be sorely disappointed. Better yet, save yourself the pain and just avoid this film altogether. Then again, if drastic plot reworkings are your thing - go right ahead. But if you are expecting the cinematic brilliance and glamor of ""Interview"" or ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" forget it! First off, the casting director should be shot. Obviously he/she is completely unfamiliar with the vivid world of vampires and creatures of the night lovingly crafted by Anne Rice. Marius and Pandora are grotesque parodies of the stunning characters in the books. Armand is a joke. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah were the only saving grace - however, Aaliyah (gorgeous though she is) commands none of presence and authority of the vampire queen. The special effects make me want to watch Ghoulies 3 all over again. Second, although this would have been a challenging screenplay for anyone to write, the writer does a useless job of establishing the characters and their motives. For those who have never read the books, it's like being thrown into the final act of an intricate detective plot - there's no establishment of characters, plot, or intent. Marius and Armand have always fascinated me - I wanted to cry after I watched this film...from frustration. Enough said. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sad piece of celluloid. Until someone (once again) treats Anne Rice with the respect she deserves. Len Wiseman, James McTeigue, Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski....are you listening???",Queen of the Damned
193,lonno,Good Actors and a Killer Soundtrack do not a Great Film Make,3,26 March 2002,"I have been following Anne Rice's books for the better part of a decade, and if am disappointed with this adaptation of Queen of the Damned, I cannot begin to imagine the disappointment of the real purists who have been reading since the appearance of Interview With the Vampire in 1976.One could forgive the executive decision to combine and condense the books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned if certain key plot elements had been retained.  It certainly makes for a smoother plot to shift the credit for Lestat's creation onto Marius; after all, it gives the viewing audience a much more credible motive for Lestat's seeking him out, at least more credible than an insane vampire ""turning"" Lestat and immediately immolating himself.  But what is completely irreconcilable in such a compaction of two novels is the altering of the protagonist's basic character.  Lestat, in his own words, prefers to feed on evil low life types.  It is just this predilection which sets into motion the events of Memnoch the Devil.  And yet we see him preying on the innocent at least twice in this film.And what have we lost in this foul and pestilent congregation of vapours? The story of Lestat.  Allusions through wolfskin rugs just don't cut t.  -- Marius and the making of Armand; the mystique of ""Those Who Must be Kept"" and Rice's take on the true origin of vampires, a good story in itself set in ancient Egypt.  -- Lestat's friend Nikki and the origin of the Theatre des Vampires; and, integral to Lestat's character, his struggle with the concept of the world as a Savage Garden.To me, it's a terrible tragedy that movies like this make it to perhaps a much wider audience than the books they're based on.  The Vampire Chronicles have established Anne Rice as a crafter of stunning prose filled with sumptuous imagery, and horrors that are not so much visual as they are emotional and spiritual.  Those of us who know her characters long for more of her stories about them, and to us, this movie is a rude insult.",Queen of the Damned
194,amykatherine,A steaming heap of crap,1,24 December 2003,"I am so sorry that I paid to see this movie. Bad dialogue, bad plot, bad acting, bad special effects (the heart that Akasha bites into? Why so cheap and unconvincing? Why??) It's so lame that I can't think of one nice thing to say about it other than Aaliyah is gorgeous. Rent Romeo Must Die instead. That movie is watchable at least. I can't believe this movie has such a high rating! I know tons of people (me included) love Aaliyah. But this movie is just terrible!",Queen of the Damned
195,rantingraj,Not bad at all,8,1 February 2012,"This movie has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it and I still like every bit of it with a very few exceptions. At first when I heard they were making a movie on Anne Rice's third book I prayed they don't take Tom Cruz again for the role of The Vampire Lestat and thank god they didn't and thank god again they chose Stuart Townsend. After reading 3 books in which The Vampire Lestat had featured, I had formed a definite image of him in my mind, of a bold but very sensitive immortal and Stuart Townsend's performance as The Vampire Lestat is the best performance as a vampire I have ever seen while that of Vincent Perez as Marius is severely lacking - nowhere in the movie does he manage to portray himself as an ancient Vampire and being superior to Lestat in elegance and power of character and his performance is one of the shortcomings of the film. Coming to other things, after seeing the movie for the first time I felt disappointed that they changed many things from the chronicles but at the same time, I did not fail to appreciate how so many other things like the spirit of Anne Rice's tales were still there in the movie and the music they included was simply spectacular. If The Vampire Lestat were real and would make a musical album he might write the exact same one. As for things being changed I understand their reasons.. Anne Rice's chronicles of Vampires is too huge a tale and there's no way they could cram every thing in a 2 hour movie. They had to include the essence of it and still have it make sense and changing a few things here and there had to be done.As for the special effects, it does look artificial at times and is a little too excessive, they should have relied less on it and relied more on the old disappearing from one place to another instead of showing them blurringly flying perhaps. Anne Rice did however explicitly state that her Vampires were capable of all this and it was an attempt to be as true to the book as is possible.",Queen of the Damned
196,indecentmoon,interesting accents and really nice pale skin,10,5 September 2003,"Stuart Townsend is the best person to play the part of Lestat he has that...look about him. The girl who played Jesse, Marguerite Moreau, just wasn't the right person. I think it was her voice, she was too innocent and they really didn't show a lot her character. I love vampire movies and this is one of my favorites. I think it's the heavy metal music mixed with the confusing plot that did it. Plus Stuart Townsend is much cuter when hes pale with long hair.",Queen of the Damned
197,charmainepunk,It's a pretty sh** movie,3,8 October 2021,"The only reason this movie deserves any credit is it is well cast (Stuart Townsend is hot, Aaliyah is twice as hot) & the 2 scenes that get reposted all over the internet because of ~aesthetic~. Lol, past that it's...a mess. Bad effects considering what was available at the time, soundtrack
is pretty bad unless you were into Korn & NIN in the 2000's, underwhelming story arch, wayyyy overacted - too serious & lacking self awareness to be funny. The first two points have always made me wish it was a good movie though. I'll just live in the two good scenes.",Queen of the Damned
198,gcoregistrar,Anne Rice must have had a fit!,4,12 June 2018,"How could a movie with such high production values get so much wrong? 
1. With exceptions of Mahatet and Akasha, the entire cast was, well, miscast! Lestat is constantly described by Anne Rice as tall (got that right), with long full blonde hair (oops!), and was French (oops again!) Lestat was turned into a vampire not by Marius, who was described as being very tall (oops!), with long flowing blonde hair - the Kelts that kidnapped him in the book kept him captive until his hair grew long. He was the illegitimate son of an Italian father by a Keltic slave woman.
2. Lestat was actually turned into a vampire by an old (as on he was old when he stole the blood from a vampire to make himself immortal) vampire, told Lestat a few basic things, gave him his wealth and a tower in Paris, then promptly killed himself by going into a fire. Lestat was now alone in Paris, having traveled there with the son of a rich merchant neighbor, Nicolo, who played the violin. 
3. Lestat learned to love and play the violin, not from a random gypsy he met on a beach, but from watching and listening to his beloved childhood friend, Nicolo.
4. Lestat met Marius, not on an island as the vampire who brought Lestat immortality, but in Egypt, where Lestat had eventually wandered with Gabrielle, his mother, whom he had rescued from near death from consumption, turning her into a vampire as his companion.
5. Akasha was killed, not by Maharet drinking the last of her blood after Akasha had been drained by the other vampires at Maharet's compound, butby Maharet's tongueless, mute twin sister, Mekare, who tore Akasha's head off, taking the demon spirit into herself, not into Maharet.
 I can understand changing around a few things in a movie to make the plot run more smoothly, but to get so many things completely wrong, is just plain wrong! Blonde hair versus dark brown hair may not sound like much, but Lestat was known to be very vain about his appearance, and big brautiful fluffy long hair seems right - aside from the fact that Tom Cruise had long blonde hair in the prequel to this (albeit he was almost half a foot shorter than Stuart Townsend), and I doubt that list start would have died his hair brown every morning after having had blonde hair for so long! Another messed up element is one of Lestat's sidekicks, Louis, who was nowhere to be found in this movie. In her book, Anne Rice had Louis spend the night before the concery with the band at Lestat's secure compound in Carmel, California, and rode with them to the concert, which took place not in Death Valley but in San Framcisco. In her book, Marius is described as being of a towering height due to his Keltic forbears, even taller than Lestat's described 6 foot height. I don't know who wrote the script, but it wasn't Anne Rice...at times the actors seem to be speaking lines straight out of a bad soap opera. The movie us, at times, a fun one, but it would have been 10 times better had the scriptwriter kept to the story and to Anne Rice's characterizations. I was expecting so much more, but I was truly disappointed!",Queen of the Damned
199,modwolf,fans of the books i advise you not to even go near this movie,1,24 July 2005,"This movie has the promise of a great film and a fantastic soundtrack which in truth is the only good thing to come out of this film, but thats about it.the acting was reasonable expect for Maurius, the acting was as dead as the character.nothing in this movie stays true to the books from to the color of Lestats hair and ever onwards, I don't care if Stuart doesn't look good with blonde hair, he is not Lestat unless he's blonde it is a strong part of the character.Nothing makes any sense in this movie for example five characters appearing without any explanation of who they are, even avid fans of the novels like me could only speculate. the idea that sunlight would be ineffective after drinking Akasha's blood was ridiculous and over the top stupid.I have heard from a friend that in the extras the director has given his excuses for these faults but that doesn't make up for the stupid film, if you can't make it right don't make it at all.interview with a vampire managed to interpret the novel brilliantly.",Queen of the Damned

201,troniix,Warner Bro's crap on a stick.,2,18 April 2006,"OK, heres the deal, I have the entire vampire chronicles memorized, including those that wasn't even written as of the release of this movie. And this movie is horrid. Interview with the Vampire, was despite having bad casting in many roles, a good representation of that book, the mood was right, the ""look"" was right..and the story was only moderately hacked leaving most of the story intact. Queen of the damned on the other hand, was strictly to get the Gen ""X"" crowd to see Allyiah in leather and silk, Stuart Townsend shirtless, and Jonathan Davis's original songs..The story was cut to the point it wasn't the same story. Lestat's maker is NOT Marius. Where's Mekare? (the real QUEEN of the damned) Where is Louis? Why wasn't more attention paid to Khayman, who had an important role in the story...Azim...Gabrielle ...Armand, Daniel (The interviewer from Interveiw with the Vampire) Why did the Queen die in that fashion, part of what makes the ""real"" ending cool, was the fact that as powerful as the Queen was, she is killed by simple, common, mortal beheading, done as a human would do it with a large sharp pane of glass..Why did it not show the Queen Killing innocent men everywhere she went, as that was her whole purpose for waking, not Lestats music. There was no mention of how Vampires came to be, which is really the true point of the entire Queen of the Damned story. I know they couldn't leave everything in with film time constraints, but they cut out most of the important characters, and almost all of the relevant story. It's pretty, the music is decent. but its not the same story. Anne Rice was on set during IWTV. and it showed, Warner Bros. refused to allow Anne Rice any rights or say on this film, and wouldn't even allow her to come to the sets, again. It showed. The casting was bad again. Lets clear this up. Lestat is about 6 foot tall, 175lb-ish, medium length blonde hair, eves that range from blue to Gray. Not 5'6"" with brown hair, and brown eyes, or 6'0"" with brown hair and brown eyes. Armand is not a 40 year old Latin guy, he's about 14 human years old in appearance and is Russian, has long CURLY auburn hair and is small, and looks ""boy like"" Sorry Antonio..he's not you. Marius also has long curly hair and is roman/Anglo Saxon. Allyiah looked great, and considering she did a great job, but as an African-American, she doesn't look Egyptian... overall I feel like I just watched a pre-packaged, music video, not one of my favorite stories of all time. Thanks Warner Bros. jerks.",Queen of the Damned
202,freshpro-82639,Not that bad.,6,19 October 2020,"Haven't read the novel/book to make a comparison, but this vampire movie is worth watching.",Queen of the Damned
203,GaelinWade,Where Do I Begin,5,28 February 2003,"I've just finished watching this on DVD. And.......As a 21st Century vampire movie, Queen of The Damned, isn't bad. Despite its plot flaws, it's visually appealing and has an awesome soundtrack. (Not really my preferred type of music, but I do appreciate some of it. And the music was very fitting for the film and Lestat character.) Chock full of special effects, the roles were well cast (for Gen. Y'ers to whom the movie appears to be directed) and performed.....for a vampire flick.Just not an Anne Rice Vampire flick.Granted it's been a few years since I've read Rice's Queen of the Damned (a book I adored btw), but this movie bore no resemblence to the novel whatsoever. Why on earth it bears the novel's title, I have no clue. Aaliyah's Akasha appears in only...maybe...15 mins of the entire film. The rest is a rather disjointed mess (relative to the novel) and runs like an overly long music video. (Why is Pandora---a former Roman noblewoman---walking around in an Indian Sari?!??!!?)The DVD's special features section has about 10 deleted scenes, which in my opinion, the producers should have left in the movie. That way, the movie would have made a heck of a lot more sense and we would know who the hell is who.  Other than Lestat, no one else is recognizable. And Lestat only because his name is repeated over and over and over and over again.Though Stuart Townsend makes an appealing and sexy disaffected and rebellious vampire turned rock star, Lestat he is not. His portrayal (more a flaw of the writers than his acting, I think) shows none of the maturity, cunning, nor charm Lestat should have had after a few hundred years of existence. This is particularly true given the Lestat character Tom Cruise played in ""Interview with A Vampire"" and given that the events of that movie took place long before those of this one. (Please note that Cruise wouldn't have been my choice for Lestat either, but in the end the character he turned out was well done.)I found Akasha's shimmying around annoying.  If its purpose was the emphasize the Queen's etherealness, it failed.  She comes off looking more like a second-rate backup dancer/groupie than Queen of all that is unholy. Again, this is not the fault of the actress, but one of the writers and director. However, I did get the impression that Aaliyah's portrayal would have been much better had they given her more to do than shimmy around.Vincent Perez's Marius was one of the more all-around appealing characters, if inconsistant. Of indeterminate sexuality, the character of Marius displays at times his loneliness and disenchantment, yet a certain mischievousness (sp?), as he should be. The inconsistency comes in the fact that he's never really one or the other in the same scene. His personality seems to shift for no reason. Yet another fault of the writers.The Jesse character was well-played by the actress (sorry, I forget her name). And the ""love story"" between her and Lestat was fitting for **this** version of ***a*** vampire movie.  Tho, she kind of made me feel, ""will someone please slap her."" But since, I can't remember the character from the book at all, I don't know if that was intentional or not.As for the other characters, there wasn't enough of them on screen to really offer an opinion.In sum, if you want to see a visually appealing vampire movie for the new millenium, rent Queen of the Damned. If you're expecting any resemblance to Anne Rice's books and their characters stay far, far away.",Queen of the Damned

It might as well have been completely different story from the original novel. All of the characters...well most of them, perhaps a few...fine there was one character that came close to following the book and that was Akasha. And she wasn't even that similar. Usually, when adapting a book into a movie the screenwriter usually cuts parts to make it fit into a time slot. In this case, they cut out so much and added things that never really happened. For goodness sakes, Mael was older than the man who played David and David is supposed to be in his 60s during this time. They completely cut out Louis, Gabrielle, Mekare and the entire story of how the Vampires came to be. Then the characters of Pandora, Armand, Mael and Khayman were merely extras and only showed up at the very end. They never even speak their names. And Pandora is a Roman woman, not Indian. Khayman was young when made a vampire, not an elderly man. Marius did NOT make Lestat and he should've been typed out of the role. Finally, Lestat. There is almost nothing right about Lestat. Lestat is a BLOND and was made by MAGNUS and had several fledglings, including his mother and best friend. Thats where he got the Stradavarius violin.",Queen of the Damned
205,mrandall,Lestat's lament,5,25 February 2002,"I love Anne Rice and what's more important, I love The Vampire Lestat. Anne Rice created the perfect anti hero ... child like, living life (or death) to the fullest, sexy, seductive and of course evil.... but not always evil, just when he feels like it. ""Interview with the Vampire"" (the movie) had the mood of the first book, had the darkness and the sensuality and it had the pain of Louis.  It also included a bit of the homoerotic theme that is so prevalent in Anne Rice's books. ""Queen of the Damned"" is lighter more full of fun, and that was perfect because Lestat had none of the pain and deep internal struggle of Louis from the first book/movie. Did it capture the mood of the book? Well, no. It was sexy and the actor who played Lestat was PERFECT!(Stuart Townsend) He was lithe and sexy and smoldering and devilish in short the brat prince himself.... Basically Tom Cruise's performance as Lestat is rendered lackluster after seeing this guy.... Now the rest of the movie: <sigh> Well, if you love the characters and the story of The Queen of the Damned (the book) then you will be disappointed, because this does not follow the story at all.... no Daniel, no Louis, Lestat is Marius's fledgling and they basically take Armand's story of becoming a vampire and turn it into Lestat's re- birth... Only one ancient red head instead of the twins of the book, and she is played by Lena Olin (who does not have red hair....) I'm not sure which one of the Vampire Coven was Armand.... but in the credits he is listed so apparently he was there... and finally Aaliya, she was not good and that breaks my heart since she is no longer with us, she was so beautiful, much like all the Anne Rice characters are supposed to be, sweet, pure and lovely.... Very disappointing performance as Akasha. So see the film for the sexiness, see it for the Stuart Townsend, the man who plays Lestat, or for the fun music ( sounds like Korn) but if you are a fan of the book, don't expect the story you loved, it is not there.For horror fans it is great fun, violent but over the top violence, for anyone else I would give this a pass, I'm sure the story is even more confusing if you haven't read the book.",Queen of the Damned

Even though this movie contradicts itself throughout and if you are fan of Anne Rice's Lestat and her books going there you could probably find mistakes throughout this flick.

I was incredibly impressed with Stuart Townsend (sp?)'s Lestat...He was sooo much better than Tom Cruise..I always thought that Cruise was too old to play Lestat, and I think Stuart's portrayl was definitely closer to the Lestat in the novel: charming and dangerous, and at the same time, alone and tragic.  The supporting cast was great: Aliyah was effective as the Queen of the Vampires; Vincent Perez was great as Marius.Maybe it is just me; I loved the whole dark, almost Goth theme to the movie, along with a Lestat who is tired of living through eternity alone.

The fact that Aaliyah would be playing the title role was not comforting, nor were the previews, which showed extended shots of Aaliyah eating a still-beating heart. And still I pushed aside my doubts, reminded myself that ""Interview with the Vampire"" hadn't been too bad, and forked over the five dollars for a ticket to ""Queen of the Damned."" I was surprised not to be surprised.""Queen of the Damned"" is exactly what it sounds like--a group of pretty actors and actresses (and singers) vying for the position of most ridiculous role. Whether it's Stuart Townsend's laughable portrayal of the dangerous Lestat (who, I had thought, was supposed to be French--I suppose one must disregard Townsend's lisping, almost Germanic attempt at an accent) or Marguerite Moreau's bland performance as the enigmatic Jesse, watching this movie was rather like watching a train crash.

Two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.I maintain the only way for these two books -Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY same names different story.If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.If you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, will hate it.",Queen of the Damned
216,RichieRich1,A huge disaster!,3,16 July 2006,"When I heard that they were going to do this movie I felt very excited and really looked forward to seeing it. Interview with the vampire was a wonderful movie and I think Tom Cruise did a wonderful performance in that one. Unfortunately when I heard that Aaliyah was cast as Akasha I knew something had gone terribly wrong. First of all Anne Rice should have written the script (like she did for IWTV). The Vampire chronicles are very popular and the film company wouldn't have had any problems getting famous actors in the leading parts. I think Catherine Zeta Jones could have been wonderful as Akasha, Jude Law as Lestat, Lena Olin was great as Maharet and Ralph Fiennes as Marius.With a great director this movie could have easily been as great as IWTV but Warner Brothers were so cheap and did not care s### about this movie so they hire this nobody from Australia to direct and cast a couple of Australian actors in supporting parts. Claudia Black was alright as Pandora but the Australian actor who played Armand was totally wrong for the part.Stuart Townsend was a disaster, I don't understand where they found him cause he looked like he was acting in a totally different movie. Aaliyah (God rest her soul) was a beautiful and talented singer but her acting abilities were limited and that is clearly shown in this picture. (Her accent is awful in this movie).The screen writers, producers and director is to blame for this mess and that they dedicated this movie to the memory of Aaliyah was a disgrace. She will be remembered for her wonderful music and not for this huge disappointment.I don't understand why Anne Rice haven't gone out stating how the movie company totally ruined this movie. She was angry that Tom Cruise played Lestat but at least he did a good job in a wonderful movie but this movie should have given her a heart attack cause they haven't been true to her books.They only good things about the movie is the Music (Jonathan Davis rules), the Score written by Jonathan and Richard Gibbs and Lena Olin's performance, the rest is crap!!!Stay away from this one!!!!",Queen of the Damned
217,AnAlienFromVenus,Pretty bad,3,2 November 2020,"I liked the cinematography, the color palletes and moods of some scenes but the acting was really bad at some places and made me cringe. Only after watching the movie I found out that it was supposed to be a sequel for ""Interview with a vampire"" and I can say that it didn't do any justice for the storyline, would not watch again.",Queen of the Damned
218,Greg-232,An insult to Anne Rice,2,4 March 2002,"When the 90+ minutes of this drivel ended, I felt slighted.  I felt as if I had been cheated of my matinee $5.  As an avid fan of the Vampire Chronicle books by Anne Rice, I wonder how she ever allowed her name to be put on such complete and utter crap.The absolute plot inconsistencies are completely ridiculous.  It is as if the writers took the book, read it, and threw it out the window before beginning the screenplay.  I would understand some small omissions in order to condense a long book into a movie, but drastically changing the integral plot points (such as individual vampires' makers, lovers, and friends) is completely inexcusable.There were only 2 things that I can even imagine complimenting in this movie.  First, the soundtrack.  With bands like Disturbed, Orgy, and Korn on board, the driving rock of The Vampire Lestat was perfectly set.  Second the performance of Stuart Townshend was terrific.  As I read the books, I formed a mental picture of Lestat.  Tom Cruise wasn't it.  Stuart Townshend was. From the patterns of speech to the latent sexuality, to the dark beauty, he was everything Anne Rice described in her hero Lestat.  Townshend's acting was the only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1.",Queen of the Damned
219,santosped,Only for Vampire fans...,7,9 June 2002,"The film really does what it promises: vampires, cool visuals and hard music.If you're a fan of Vampire stories, hard rock music and gothic environments, then you should see it. Of course it's not a masterpiece but it's cool and entertaining enough to spend 100 min. There is a really good work in the production of the film and well accomplished character and scenario visuals. Vampire Lestat is really good. Shame for a not so good Queen Aqasha.You must see the Woodstock-like concert with an epic Vampire battle!!! Cool!!!",Queen of the Damned
220,nydrydoc,Different. And good. Damn good!,10,24 February 2002,"People are just dumping on this sequel because it isn't `Interview with the Vampire.' It is different.And it is good. Damn good.Aaliyah was absolutely WONDERFUL. Townsend was a very good Lestat, again, different, but good. Overall, the movie didn't quite manage the dark erotic power of the first, but it came damn close-and Aaliyah had all the same erotic energy.I look forward to the next installment.",Queen of the Damned
221,EZamor,"A Nice-Looking, Fun Vampire Flick",7,14 September 2002,"I don't understand why there's so much controversy over this movie. Expectations not met regarding its deviation from the Anne Rice novels, or from the movie `Interview,' and Aaliyah not being used to her full potential, etc.  Forget all that.  `Queen' is surprisingly an enjoyable movie.The visuals look sharp, the action is fun, and the songs and score sound great.  This movie kept me entertained from start to finish--isn't that enough?My real complaint is that the storyline isn't thoroughly cohesive, and the plot leaves a few things utterly unexplained.  However, the deleted scenes in the DVD extras make up for this.  Apparently, they needed (?) to cut a few important and interesting scenes due to time constraints or some nonsense.  Too bad the DVD wasn't released as a director's cut or something.",Queen of the Damned
222,XvPanteraX,People Were Expecting Too Much,10,2 March 2002,"Alright for the Anne Rice fans, myself being one of them...this movie was, it really was a bad book adaptation. But I really feel that if fans and non-fans alike view this movie as simply ""a vampire movie"" they'll enjoy. Don't go into a movie already having expectations of what it is going to be like. And don't expect it to be close to Interview With The Vampire. Why did I like this movie so much? As the girl in Lestat's band stated, ""Sex, blood, and rock n roll"" I thought Stuart Townsend did a pheonomonal job of playing the modern/rocker/playful Lestat.  I thought the music was excellent and if you actually read the lyrics that make A LOT of sense, seeing as Lestat was supposed to be the one who wrote them. Aaliyah fans who are going to see this movie simply because she is in it...a word of caution she is only in it for about 26 minutes, but...it's a very good 26 minutes. With the little screen time she had she carried the role of Akasha very nicely. The movie does express some ""corny"" lines, but they make you laugh...and the communication between Lestat and Marius is also rather entertaining. This movie has a lot...action, gore, a twisted love story, rock n roll, amusement...it's something you can really sink your teeth into.",Queen of the Damned
223,lorilou14,GREAT!,10,2 September 2002,"I, being a devout Anne Rice lover, was not let down at all by the film Queen of the Damned. I thought that it was excellent! I thought it was very erotic and sexy, along with being mysterious, like it should be. I think they did a wonderful job of catching everything. Usually when a film is based off of a movie, things are weird and skipped at times but I did love everything about this movie. Aaliyah was wonderful and how many times would I have to sing about how beautiful Stuart Townsend is? The movie was just wonderful!",Queen of the Damned
224,Blaze_Darkmoon,Brilliantly Done Film,10,26 February 2002,"I had known about this film since the Fall of 1999. I had seen ""Interview with the Vampire"" which intrigued me to see ""Queen of Damned."" I patiently counted down the months until the films debut. On the night of the premiere, I had come down with a stomach virus, but that did not deter me from seeing it on opening week. The Sunday after its release, I called a few of my friends and we went out. I sat in awe as I watched the movie. The acting was brilliant. Stuart Townsend captured Lestat in ways Tom Cruise never could. And Aaliyah- There is no other person that I thought could tackle the role of Akasha as well as she did. And THE MUSIC! Even if you hated the movie, you could not have hated the soundtrack. Jonathan Davis of KoRn had the perfect vocals for the rock star vampire. It was slightly upsetting that Davis' voice could not be heard on the CD, but the artists who were chosen in his place were equally as excellent. It is certainly as must have album. The film was incredible in my opinion.",Queen of the Damned
225,SandyFury,Absolutely Awesome... Anne Rice would be proud.,10,22 February 2002,"I just came from seeing Queen of the Damned and cast my 10 vote. I was very much looking forward to seeing this particular book of the Vampire Chronicles as it was my favorite of the original three that I'd read many years ago. I thought it was divine fate it coming out on my birthday so my friend and I went to the first show. I was definitely NOT disappointed and I don't think anyone else into vampire  movies will be either. I absolutely think this movie did complete justice to the sentiment of the author and her characters. First of all: The sets of the movie were beautifully done. The backdrops, the props, all of it. Special effects were awesome!!!! Another great thing about the movie were the original songs that Lestat sings. This was something that could've potentially been a disaster for the films makers had they not been both believable and very very good. They were more than believable and more than good.. I foresee the soundtrack being a big seller with me at the front of the line. The vampires were beautiful and terrifying as was my impression when I read the book. I thought the depth and scope of the ""companion""s relationships were underplayed but was very happy it was note entirely overlooked Ie, Marius and Lestat, Marius and Dave Upon leaving the theater the only semi fault I could find when speculating on how this fabulous film could have possibly been any better was the relationship between Lestat and Jessie was not explored enough to jive with the ending. I felt like there was a little skip in the record there. Why would Lestat care so much? etc... The movie surely could've done with another hour to develop the intensity and length of all of the relationships: between Lestat and Marius, Jessie and Lestat, Marius and Dave, Marius and Akasha, and Lestat and Akasha, and so on. As a Lestat fan I certainly would sit through any length film with Lestat... But for the time given to the films makers it was really well done.I loved this film and would see it again and recommend it to everyone who likes vampire movies. My friend who went with me who has never read an Anne Rice book, but who is very into vampire movies like Blade, loved it.",Queen of the Damned
226,SladoledMan,Was this a movie...or a Music Video?,3,25 February 2002,"So I'm sitting there in a packed theater opening night of this movie thinking to myself is this just another episode of MTV's TRL (Total Request Live) or a movie?  I was just waiting for the plain faced tool known as Carson Daly to pop out and start interviewing Lestat.  You know Interview With a Vampire...shoot i think that was done already.  Honestly I had low expectations going into this movie and i was not let down.  This movie really left me asking a bunch of questions, it left so many loose strands that probably someone not familiar with Anne Rice novels (like myself) do not understand.  The premise was pretty interesting I thought...Lestat coming back into the public eye through a Goth Rock band.  A very smart and modern type of way to go, and you would figure in your head if an immortal vampire did exist in our time it stands to reason that he would probably be a member of a Goth rock band.  Unfortunately the union of Lestat and a band seems really rushed.  We get introduced to an even older vampire Marius, whose past seems very interesting but you feel cheated because they do not even develop this character at all.  Its all about the good looking/modern vampire Lestat and any other vampires in this movie are secondary because they are not as good looking as Stuart Townsend.  The late Aaliyah was beautiful in this movie, she really did look  goddess like but her role was a bit short and underdeveloped too i felt, more Aaliyah would have been a good thing.  This movie really felt like it was targeted to the TRL audience ages 13-18 so if you fall below or above that or are not a HUGE Ann Rice fan skip this damned movie.",Queen of the Damned
227,LMBeth,"Not the book, but not bad...",8,23 February 2002,"Let's start with what is not so good: Being an avid Anne Rice fan, the prospect of my favorite of The Vampire Chronicles making the jump to the silver screen thrilled me. Then I found out how many changes they had made, and I was a bit peeved. There are moments when the speed of the rock videos interspersed throughout the 100 minutes seems to be fighting against some drag in the story. I have a feeling that if the script writers had cut some of the longer camera pans and taken that extra time and another twenty minutes, not only could they have been more faithful to the book (the Legend of the Twins, some more character history), but they also could have fleshed out some more of the characters, especially Akasha, who lacks the complexity that made her such an interesting and seductive villain in the book.That being said, I give the film makers this defense: I have a feeling that while a good percentage of the people coming to see this film will be Anne Rice fans, another percentage will be fans of the late Alliyah, a group who I doubt (1) have even HEARD of The Vampire Chronicles, (2) would understand the poetry that made the book so intoxicating, and (3) have the attention span to sit for those additional twenty minutes, much less read the book.Let us, therefore, remove the movie from the book, and look at what was good: the pace, though slow at times, did have enough moments to keep you enraptured and get your heart pounding. The camera work helps transport us into the world of the vampire. The story (there ARE elements of the book present) worked and flowed, connecting and explaining most of the questions it posed.As was said above, the characters and their histories could have been established a bit more, but what was there was good. The concerned and wise David Talbot (McGann), the pure passion and power of Akasha, and the weary but ever fighting fatherly figure of Marius (Perez) all transfer to the screen well. While disappointed at the lack of development from Armand (Newton), Pandora (Black), Mael (Manon), Khayman (Spence), and especially Maharet (an albeit luminous Olin), and the complete lack of Gabrielle, Louis, and others, I must give kudos to Stewart Townsend and Marguerite Moreau.The chemistry between the two was AMAZING and one of the best points of the movie. Of everything that was changed from the book, this is perhaps the best and the choice I agree with the most. The conflict, love, and passion between Lestat and Jesse drives the movie and even manages to slip in some of Anne Rice's messages from the book.If you are an Anne Rice fan and you go expecting a near word for word adaption as was seen in ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something that takes rich characters, plays with them, and creates a fun and (at times) truly intoxicating movie, then spend the money and trust that ""The Queen of the Damned"" will take you on a journey you may not want to come back from.",Queen of the Damned
228,Zfire9969,Great adaption which most will enjoy...,10,25 February 2002,"After seeing this movie I was left with an unusual taste. This was the taste of satisfaction. It is unusual because I haven't seen many vampire movies that could produce like Queen did. Not having the big named stars of its predecessor, (i.e. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas) Queen still managed to be a very entertaining and interesting film for ANY movie-goer yet alone just a vampire fan, Anne Rice fan or not.The film takes points in the books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned and forms them to make one helluva movie! This was questioned by many fans of the Anne Rice novels and was answered by the explanation of the Producers are making one movie and did quite frankly one of the best damn jobs possible. The sexy bravado of both Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend mix as they form a great on-screen vampire duo. Fans of Interview With the Vampire won't be left missing the same actors as the new cast adds a better feel for the ethnic backgrounds of all the vampires. Also, the character of Lestat must be thought about for a second or two. In Interview, Lestat was shown as he was in the eyes of Louis. In Queen, Lestat is how he is in his own point of view, these are two different images with some likenesses but many major differences.Queen of the Damned showcases great acting, a great sense of atmosphere, a kick-ass soundtrack, and an all around vampire feel. I enjoyed the movie as will you!",Queen of the Damned
229,saifulf,"A treat for Rice fans, for everyone else...a chance to ruminate on how low Hollywood can sink to.",10,16 April 2002,"This movie should satisfy the thirsts of all Rice fans who have been waiting for a sequel to ""Interview.."". It is not the book per se but rather a mixture of Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. Also, not as stylishly shot as ""Interview"",but still to any fan of the Vampire Chronicles, the movie is so much more intimate and personal. I gave this a ten just because it was made and because It felt wonderful to see Lestat on screen again, not because this movie is one of the best I have seen. And I think it deserves a lot more credit than people have given it, true, the accents are annoying but, whatever... it's still cool, plus the music rather kicks ass. So to all Rice fans and hard rockers, don't miss this one. And Stuart Townsend does a better Lestat than Cruise, much more vampirish and with more charm.",Queen of the Damned
230,thehop20,Decent yet superficial.,5,21 February 2002,"While it's no where near as good as Interview with a Vampire, Queen of the Dammed is pretty decent. Thanks in part of Steward  Townsend performance as the Vampire Lestat He is actually better than Tom Cruse in the role because he at least plays the part with The charming flare Ann Rice intended it to have, unlike the spoiled brat Tom Cruse played in Interview with the Vampire. While his and the Late Aaliyah performance are good, the movie unfortunately is not.  It feels more like a Music video than a film, and Aaliyah does not even come into the film int'l the last forty five minutes of the movieIt's decent but it could have been a lot more.",Queen of the Damned
231,Mercian,It didn't suck [Contains Spoilerish Material],8,23 February 2002,"If you are expecting a faithful rendering of Anne Rice's novel, you will be sorely disappointed.  You will also be somewhat foolish - we all know that it is be nigh on impossible to create the depth of character, landscape, background & mythology in film that one finds in any good novel, let alone novels as densely written as the divine Ms Rice's.If, however, you have the basic common-sense to expect a film loosely based on the Anne Rice novels, you may well enjoy yourself.
One reviewer has noted their annoyance at the accents used by certain members of the cast.  In my humble opinion, it seems reasonable that a French nobleman would have a French accent; a Roman would have a Latin accent; an Egyptian would have an African/Arabic accent.  And, of course, as any non-American can tell you, whether or not an accent is irritating is purely subjective.As in any film, there are times when more information on a character, motivation, or background would have been nice.  In this film, more information on Akasha herself would have been invaluable.  Aaliyah (Akasha) herself is shamefully under-used, it's true; however, Stuart Townsend (Lestat)fairly burns up the screen.  Vincent Perez's (Marius) wisdom & puritanical adherence to the rules clashes beautifully with his desire for mortal contact (& obsession with red velvet).  Marguerite Moreau (Jesse) thinks she knows what she wants, but her romanticism cannot withstand a dose of reality.The lack of reference to the history & role of the Talamasca, information about Davaid Talbot, & explaination of Akasha's origins & powers weaken the film.  That said, there is much to enjoy here:* Lestat's realisation that the 'MTV-age' is the best possible era for an egotistical vampire to exist in * His revelry in public adoration & notoriety * Marius's jealousy & internal moral wrangling * Maharet's quiet authority * Jesse's panic when faced with the reality of vampirism * Akasha's amusement at Lestat's ego * The tongue-in-cheek observations of the rockstar-fan relationship; our cultural refusal to believe in the supernatural whilst being obsessed with the idea of power beyond our ken; the entertainment industry's identification with the vampire * The sumptuous sets, costumes, make-up, & effects.To summarise: Don't go expecting Anne Rice.  Go expecting a vampire film. It's really rather fun.",Queen of the Damned

I just enjoyed the visuals, the music, the actors. Just shows how subjective the art form is. After seeing it ten or fifteen times, the plot made perfect sense to me. I'm a rock musician and the notion of a vampire using rock to reconnect with humans and upset his own breed resonated with me. I like this Lestat better than Tom Cruise's, and Marius almost steals the movie for me. Aliyah's scene in the vampire bar (slinky!) and the concert are visually stunning. And the cinematography takes full advantage of the many interesting faces. Not quite Eisenstein, but effective.

237,hjohnny37,Aaliyah couldnt save it !,2,11 May 2003,"Well I didnt read the book nor did I see 'Interview with a vampire', maybe thats why I didnt understand a damn thing about this movie.  I used to like vampire movies but it seems they just become worse every year.  Maybe its becos I have seen it all about vampires and sucking blood doesnt surprise or shock me anymore that I didnt like this movie.  The acting wasnt very convincing either, the best actor was the guy who played 'Lestat' although I didnt think he would be a cool vampire.  Aaliyah's first appearance was quite stunning but after that she didnt add anything exciting to the movie. A vampire who reveals his past and comes back after a long time, sounds a good idea indeed but it got me so sleepy, so lil action sigh.  And the end was pretty pathetic too. I wonder why Lestat and Jessie get together in the end cos they dont care for each other, my opinion is Jessie just wanted to be a vampire herself.  But if thats wrong dont blame me cos I dont know what this movie should have learned us.",Queen of the Damned

If you make an opinion of Anne Rice or her body of work from viewing this aberration please go check out her books and resculpt that view. However 'Interview with the vampire' did a great job of staying on track and stayed almost true to the books. But if yo uare expecting Q.O.T.D. to be anywhere near as good as I.W.T.V. be in for disgust.,Queen of the Damned
241,Christophe44,"Less good than it's predecessor, but it has the spirit of it's time.",7,24 March 2004,"In itself, ""Queen of the damned"" (QOTD) is not a bad movie; the problem is that it follows ""Interview with a vampire"" from Neil Jordan. If we make a difference game between the two movies, QOTD end with a lost.The actors: Tom Cruise will always be the perfect visualisation of Lestat, he had a good comprehension of the evil inside Lestat. Stuart Towsend, even if he has the intelligence to not act as a 'Tom Cruise clone', is fader and he doesn't seem to be an old vicious and experienced vampire.
The directors: Neil Jordan has made a romantic  story (in the litterature sense of the word), due to his intense collaboration with Ann Rice. Michael Rymer has made a good video clip for ""Lestat Rock Band"", it's the MTV style, certainly a consequence of the absence of Ann Rice for the supervision of the script.The Music: Elliot Goldenthal has made a partition that brought the visual style of the movie to another level. Just listening the music makes you feel the vampiric emotions. In QOTD, close tour eyes and you feel nothing exept that you want to break something.The visual effects: They seems to be better in QOTD but, if you look at the first movie,  you'll notice that they're just visual effects, not supernatural effects. They try to representent supernatural, but they are just fake ones.BUT, even if QOTD seems to be a less better movie than his predecessor, I think it isn't right to say it's a bad movie. Making an adaptation is making choices, and QOTD is an harder book to adapt that the rest of the Vampire Chronicles, because it's story is more complicated. The principal argument of Interview with the Vampire was that the vampire has to live with the current time, not with past. The adaptation choice results from that: Lestat is no longer a romantic character, he now live in another time, where all is fake and superficial. That's the essence of QOTD, and it's not as stupid as it seems. SEE IT, it's no waste of time, if you like gothic atmosphere...",Queen of the Damned
242,soupdragonz,Bad to the bone and not in a good way,4,27 June 2004,"I realize that no movie can ever be as good as the book.. but the screenwriter took the book and wiped his ass with it. It mishmashes Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned into a choppy story line that left much to be desired. The casting not done well either; Vincent Perez and Stuart Townsend are good actors but NOT good choices for the downy haired,seductive beautiful, pretty boy killers that the characters are described to be. Marius' character looks like he walked out of a 50's vampire B movie. Interview with the Vampire was an outstanding adaptation (mind you not the same as the book but still very close to the point) this not even close.

In fact Queen of the Damned is my favorite of the Vampire chronicles. This movie in no way even resemble the book. In fact, I don't even think the script was written using the book. Hardly anything that happens in this movie actually happen in any of the vampire chronicles. Putting that aside, did this movie even have a plot? Or a story line at all? It was so hard to follow, nothing made sense. someone needs to give the writer a copy of the book and teach him the definition of a vampire, If anyone is interested in the story of the queen of the damned, I highly recommend reading the book. Burn this movie.",Queen of the Damned
244,Koosler,Below par,3,9 November 2018,"As a fan of the Chronicles I remember eagerly waiting for this movie, having liked the previous one a lot. Boy, what a disappointment.The main problem is the acting, generally mediocre and especially bad in Stuart Townsend's case: it's as if he was so absorbed by the coolness of playing a vampire, he forgot to put depth to his character -which, for the absolute protagonist and supposed emotional center of the story, pretty much sinks the movie. For the Chronicles geeks out there, he might have been good enough as Killer. Certainly not as Lestat.Marguerite Moreau was passable for her role, but Lena Olin simply didn't give the slightest feeling of being a supernatural creature, let alone a 6,000 years old one; Aaliyah did a comparatively better job, taking in the eerily slow moves, the sense of indifference to others' feelings, even the brutal arrogance that was so characteristic of the Queen. And Vincent Perez, while a bit too flippant for the professorial Marius, at least put his trademark charm to good use.Alas, there's but one good performance in the entire movie, that of Paul McGann: understated but nuanced, sympathetic yet cautious. Like he was the only one taking the job seriously regardless of his secondary role.The rest is barely worth mention; the music is rarely interesting -not a fan of hard/metal rock, but I get Lestat wasn't supposed to go for opera, so whatever-, the cinematography unengaging, and the script... well, it did the exact opposite of ""Interview with the vampire"": took out all the elements that give these vampires and their stories a soul, leaving most without a motivation: why did Marius make Lestat in the first place? Why did Akasha awake suddenly after thousands of years to pick him as her new consort and then go on a ""villain of the week"" rampage? True, she wasn't necessarily more rational in the novel, but at least a backstory was provided to frame it. The movie ditches all this for a trite, Twilight-esque love story between Jessie and Lestat that dumbs down his character's tendency to become enamored with just about everyone -regardless of gender, age and even species.",Queen of the Damned
245,hackfox,Worst movie I have seen in a long time,1,11 June 2020,Honestly I think Aaliyah must have driven the plane herself into the cliffs to end her life instead of finishing this god awful movie. Enough said,Queen of the Damned
246,Shadowhardt,Watch it first,10,14 September 2006,"Personally, I LOVED TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it. It's amazing! The music, the acting, the story lines the emotion, everything...... well except for one minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. I saw this movie before Interview with the Vampire and before i even knew the books existed, so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie. I picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter movies due to lack of book loyalty)i stayed silent. Eventually i picked up ""The Vampire Lestat"" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. It is completely different (The movie Queen of the damned is a combination of ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned""). But i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it. If you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie.",Queen of the Damned
247,Kael-4,"Terrible, terrible",1,25 February 2002,"What an unfortunate way for Aaliyah to go out!  She's about the only good thing in the movie.  It's bad in so many ways that I can't even think of what to mention here.  The worst thing, I think, is that it is totally unclear why most of the characters do any of the things that they do. This is the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, and that says a lot, considering how many bad ones there are.",Queen of the Damned
248,MJenius,the festering scent of this film still burns,3,5 March 2002,"The festering scent of this movie still burns in my sinuses. Someone should stake the screen writer and the producers for releasing such a worthless, inept film upon this world. By the first hour I was wishing someone would put me out of what seemed to be the eternal misery cursed on me by the filmmakers.As a writer myself, and a fan of Anne Rice; I expected much more. I at least hoped for an adaption even worthy of the other misguided Vampire flick based on her ever worthy series. Unfortunately I did not even get that. Instead we are presented with a rambling, pointless showcase of Jonathan davis's Music, which is not even up to par of his past forayes into the subject. We were given a descent performance by the late great Allyah who only had a total of 19 minutes screen time, that is unless you count the time she was a statue in the film. Even then her acting job was much better than the rest of the cast.being a published writer in this genre, I believe i know a little about the subject. Therefor I must say it is most unfortunate such a excellent novel could be misconstrued to the point that the very essence of the story is lost in the process. I dread seeing what they can do to ruin the best book of the series ""Minock THe Devil"" in its rumored upcoming production, I suggest the movie company look into hiring the screenwriter used for the flm adaption of Red Violin, another of Anne Rices great books, and the director of The Kindred series, that was based on the game Vampire of The Masquerade. At least both of these were worth 7.50 admission and the 2hrs of your life you will never get back. Because unlike the protagonist in this film, we do not live forever and therefor our time has value.My final review: Put a stake in it. it's done. Now bury it where it will never have to be endured by another unfortunate soul.",Queen of the Damned
249,delfin-4,Don't waste your money!,2,22 February 2002,"Queen of the Damned was a beautiful film visually.  The sets, costumes, and visual effects were a feast for the eyes.  But this wasn't enough to make it worth seeing again, especially if you're an Anne Rice fan.  The first turn-off was the over-simplification of the plot and a total lack of character development.  And then came the Queen.  If Aaliyah's excessive undulations weren't enough to drive me to fits of laughter her transylvanian ebonics accent certainly did the job.  My advice - buy the books and forget the film ever existed.",Queen of the Damned
250,meggui,Crazy fun,10,12 March 2002,"One good thing about 'Queen of the Damned' is that it doesn't seem as if it were written by a committee. It's loopy and personal, somewhat loose and rambling. It seems as if it were written by a real live human writer, a person; perhaps not the world's most talented person, but a person nonetheless. This has to count in its favour when you compare it to other recent robotic exercises in camp such as the horrid 'Tomb Raider.'The other good thing about 'Queen' is the casting. Stuart Townsend makes a far better Lestat than Cruise did. Unlike Cruise, he has a certain malevolent effeminacy that is appropriate to the character. Also, he's tall.Aaliyah demonstrates a truly commanding presence as Akasha. At times, she almost makes you want to laugh; she's so over the top. But at the same time, you really can't take your eyes off her. She's so beautiful, so confident -- she really does manage to pull off this quite ridiculous character. Kudos.In spite of the low ratings the film seems to be getting, here's hoping it goes on to find a loyal cult audience.",Queen of the Damned
251,elmo55,"Meh, not great, but not horrendous",3,17 June 2002,"I must say that I went into this movie with mediocre expectations. Having heard the rumor that the film was almost scheduled for video release only, I doubted that it would be winning any Oscars. However, while I wasn't blown away, I can't say that it wasn't enjoyable.  There was eye candy in Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, some kick-ass music, and a middling story line.  I was disappointed and misled, because I thought Aaliyah would have a larger role, but that couldn't be avoided.  Some of the lines caught me halfway between a cringe and a laugh. I have to give some of the actors respect for being able to say them without wincing. And, of course, as any true fan of Farscape (a sci-fi TV show) I wanted to see the radiant Claudia Black on screen more often.  But overall It was a decent movie that is just something to pop in the VCR and kill 2 hours with. Switch off your brain, keep your eyes and ears open and have some mindless fun.",Queen of the Damned
252,mnelson1999,"Though butchering the book in one fell swoop, still a stunner.",8,27 February 2002,"Alas, if you go to the theaters expecting some sort of unbelievable trek through Anne Rice's books you are going to be distinctly disappointed.  So forget the book, for the most part anyway, and simply enjoy the tale thats been INSPIRED by her wonderful series.The acting was honestly sub-par, some of the early scenes in the movie made me want to snicker.  But once the movie starts to progress you become extremely ingrossed in the entire scene; darkness, loneliness, love, and music music music!  Once you set aside your expectations and WATCH the movie it's really quite a good flick.As for the music, I can't say enough about how amazing it is.  The videos for Lestat's songs are incredible, very dark, and very modern.  If you like Nine Inch Nails, Marylin Manson, Korn, and etc. then you'll LOVE this soundtrack.So in short, don't expect to be DAZZLED by the acting but other wise sit back, shut up, and enjoy the show.  A great movie....and for the record it makes me SICK that it only got a 5.0 rating on here.",Queen of the Damned
253,copperboom,A movie gone right...,5,23 April 2006,"...a book portrayal gone wrong. *Warning: lots of spoilers ahead* When I discovered ""Interview with the Vampire"" a few years ago, I instantly fell in love with the story and read all of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"" books. I found the movie stuck so true to the book that I couldn't wait to get my hands on the fairly new ""Queen of the Damned"".I found the opening of the movie to be kind of confusing. Even though I'd read the book, I couldn't really follow it. I was highly disappointed that the vampire Lestat, who is supposed to be blonde haired and blue eyed, was dark haired and dark eyed. That would be something I could easily overlook if the rest of the movie had gone well.I found the movie totally lost the message of the book. The book was about Lestat's accidental awakening of the Queen of all vampires and the journey they go on to, in her belief, ""fix"" humanity. Meanwhile the vital story of the Twins is incorporated, as well as a few minor stories along the way that show just how much of the world is affected by the vampires and how much hold Akasha has on the fate of humanity. The movie basically focused on Lestat and Akasha's romance. The story of the Twins was touched on but not really fully explained. The character of David was totally off, not British enough, too young and a bit too harsh. And random characters were almost thrown in front of the Hollywood sign, never explaining who they were, why they appeared, or why they cared about Lestat and/or Akasha. It was just horrible to sit through.However, if I hadn't read the book, I probably would have enjoyed the movie. It was very well filmed, the casting was well done and the romantic storyline was interesting. I actually really liked the visual aspects of the movie, except for the fact that the only character who remotely looked the part was Jesse. I know many people who have seen the movie without reading the book and loved it. My overall opinion is this- if you are looking for even a minor interpretation of the book, don't see this movie. However, if you like vampire/sci-fi movies, or you aren't picky about how novels are portrayed, then go for it. If you haven't read the book, I can almost guarantee that you'll like at least some aspect of it.",Queen of the Damned
254,mariannasierra,A Bite of good taste!,8,24 February 2002,"I just watched this movie. Although I never read one of her books I was taken in by ""Interview"" so I was compelled to see this one too. I appreciated the coming of age format in which it was set. ~~Spoiler~~ The scenes in the caves where Akasha is awoken and Lastat is introduced to his creator were some of the best scenes. I would of loved for the movie to be set in those times. It is nothing like the ""Interview.  Cruise definately was a better  vampire. Here Lastat has feelings of mortal concerns which differs totally from the previous character. However nothing is left unturned. Aaliyah shines as Akasha. There realy is not much to say if you appreciate a good vampire movie then you must go see this.It is only two hours long so you are not bored. Those who didn't know Aaliyah as a musician will leave the theater wishing they did. I am not into rock and roll but the music in this movie helped it along. All in all not bad. I am glad they opted to put it on screen instead of a MTV movie as it was originally intended to be.",Queen of the Damned
255,wulfette,"All right, fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, hold on tight, take a deep breath, because it may be your last. and come out come out where ever you are.",7,7 March 2002,"THE DAMNEDHonestly, this movie is really more about the Vampire Lestat, portrayed in an enticingly dark delight by Stuart Townsend. Lestat has been lonely too long; he decided to roam the earth in light among mortals. Against all other vampires consent, he became a rock star and exposed himself as a vampire, not to mention sharing deep vampire secrets to the mortal world. If you have read the book, Lestat has exposed himself before by becoming an actor in a theatre.In the movie, Lestat was made by Marius, who left him in despair and loneliness, but not after he taught Lestat enough lessons to live in shadows amongst mortals. You might understand Lestat's loneliness and his delicious pompous b**tard attitude more if you read the book and realize that he was in fact made by Magnus, who killed himself just after he transform Lestat into a vampire. Lestat was probably one of the only vampires forced to roam the mortal world without proper introduction to vampirism.So, what is the movie got to do with the Queen of the Damned? Basically, Lestat awakens Akasha who wants to rule the earth with demonic powers again as she did in the old days. Akasha, or She Who must be Kept is well portrayed by Aaliyah, although I must say, she does not have to be in this movie. I mean, she's only appearing in probably 15 minutes of the whole movie! I think they should just call this movie The Vampire Lestat and dedicate another separate movie to Queen of the Damned. Anyway, salute to Aaliyah who is very beautiful and graceful as well as demonic as Akasha. even though she could try a more Egyptian accent instead of the usual Vlad Dracul's Romanian/Hungarian accent...And finally, the rest of the characters. hmm. what can I say about the rest? Why oh why do you have to portray Marius to be so gay? I thought that Vincent Perez would be a good choice to play Marius, but Marius is not gay. I don't have any problems with gay community, but again Marius is not gay. And please tell me that the blond Leonardo DiCaprio look alike is not Armand, he who has been perfectly portrayed by Antonio Banderas in 'Interview'.THE FORSAKENA tribute to Goths all over the world, this movie is more of a Goth MTV celebration than an adaptation of Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned. First of all, this movie, which is far too short than its predecessor, Interview with the Vampire, is trying to capture both essence from The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. I mean, if it takes more than two hours to describe one book in 'Interview' how could they thought to achieve 2 books in a less than two hours movie.Nevertheless, it is, like I said, a tribute to Goths and as a Goth, I truly appreciate the music, the depiction of the band, Davis' cool voice and Stuart's wonderful stage performance. Stuart, you should really try forming a Goth band!!I truly despised the depiction of Lestat's tenderness towards Jesse by the end of the movie. This is not the Lestat I know, this is not the Lestat that was portrayed earlier in the movie. The Lestat that was afraid to bite when he sees blood. hello? What's going on here? And the Lestat that fly with too many sequences, especially the scene where he took Jesse for a flight. it made me think of Superman!Oh, and the ending, where he walks hand in hand with Jesse, saying hello to David Talbot. what can I say. this movie is really just worth to watch to hear great music and see beautiful people like Stuart and Aaliyah. Think of it as a video clip with a story...",Queen of the Damned
256,Dizturbd1,In memory of Aaliyah...,10,23 February 2002,"This movie is a very good movie no matter what anyone says.  It's smart, kinda qwirky, and the music rocks.  But that is not what makes this movie so kick ass.  Don't listen to anyone who thinks otherwise until you've seen it. This movie is beautiful.  At first it started out kinda weird....Lestat being a rock star just isn't right...and the whole creepy cult chic in love with Lestat really p***ed me off, but I'll get to that later.  The place where this movie starts to transform is the most hauntingly beautiful scene I've ever seen.  Aaliyah walks into a bar decked out in her ancient egyptian best.  I don't want to give anything away, but lets just say a lot of bloodsuckers fry.  The reason this movie, especially this scene is so beautiful is that it makes you feel like Aaliyah is alive.  That is also why this scene is so haunting.  You know she's dead.  And she's just incredibly beautiful.  But then again that stupid cult chic (Jesse just incase u don't know who I'm talking about) gets in the way and ruins Akasha's plans to rule with Lestat at her side.  Akasha's final scene painfully reminds everyone of Aaliyah's tragic death, but it is almost like a tribute the way she died so beautifully tragic.  So if you like vampires, Aaliyah, kick ass music, beautiful things, or just great movies go see this flik.....It's ten dollars I'm glad I spent.",Queen of the Damned

261,Jacksrevenge,Good material which went to the wrong hands,4,7 April 2002,"I was, like, REALLY interested in this movie.Ever since I saw 'Interview' on TV, I was fascinated with the moral dilemma of Vampires and its dramatic possibilities. The story on which the movie is based on, is very interesting and offers a possibility of a dramatical, visually powerful Vampire flic.Well, and after that, most things went wrong.First of all, the script is BAD. Scenes which could be giving dramatic thrills are scripted to boredom or even TOTALLY OMITTED! Akasha's second awakening, for example, is brought into the story by Marius saying: 'Oh well, yeah, she just woke up, y'know...' This is NOT dramatic. In other moments, the dialogue is so stupid you don't have the slightest idea of what is going on, for example when the part with the Family Tree is 'explained'.Secondly, there are only two people in this movie which could be called 'actors' (Townsend and Perez) and they, well, 'do their best'. Aaliyah just shows her body and beckons around in her stupid accent and could as well just be replaced with an animated character from Final Fantasy. The rest of the actors are, on the main, forgettable. Marguerite Moreau simply makes you wanna run out of the cinema and does make you think about Lestat's motives: How can he want to spend eternity with this BORING BORING person? The actor quality does the part to the film which is the greatest sin for a movie wanting to have some drama: You don't care about anyone, except maybe for Lestat. Even the beach covered with corpses does only make you feel glad you didn't experience them alive, 'cos they probably would have been bad actors, too.I gave this movie 5 out of 10 because, well, Townsend tries REALLY hard, and I really liked the music part (Jonathan Davis does a good bit here). Besides, the scene with thousands of fans approaching the concert is stunning. The movie design is also very good.Well, maybe the next Chronicles movie is made by the right people.

I personally have never read the book although I watched the movie with a friend who did and had to endure hours upon hours of her complaints and her ""NO!!! it's all wrong!!! *sniffle sniffle*"" five minutes into the movie I was LMAO and she was in tears because they destroyed her book, which apparently is a decent read. ""Where's Armand?"" she squealed angrily and that was just the beginning. Personally, I wanted to see Louis, as he was my favorite character in ""Interview,"" and she claims he was in the book. *sigh* they screwed up again. Leave it to hollywood to take a perfectly good vampire story and turn it into MTV's worst nightmare. yes it's sad to say that this corny excuse for a vampire movie actually entertained me sadder still is the fact that i wouldn't mind seeing it again. as for my friend, she's content with one of the two things they got right...the soundtrack...the second thing they actually did right was the wardrobe.

I spent the whole movie hoping he, and all the other characters would just die.  The best part of the movie was in the preview when I saw Harlan Williams doing his Wookie impression.  Townsend ruined what Tom Cruise portrayed in Interview.  The songs in the movie were decent, although from what I have been told are nothing like what they were supposed to be in the book(which I have not read).  Apparently this was a complete mockery of the book. But let's forget about the book and look at it by itself, and it is a horrible, uneventful ride.

I was hoping that goth was on its way out, but this movie shows that there are still some strongholds of dorks trying to be dark.The major characters seem to have been cast from the same lot, nothing but self-important, cooler-than-thou, Calvin Klein model wannabes.

I've seen some bad ones(""Little Women"" the one with Winona Ryder as Jo), and some very good ones(the HP movies, the Firm, IwtV). But this movie definitely falls under the ""bad ones"" category.Just before this movie came out, I'd made a vow never to support Anne Rice again by buying her books or watching her movies because of the travesties that were ""The Vampire Armand"" and ""Merrick"".  So I didn't see until a week or so ago on cable.First, kudos go to Stuart Townsend.  I believe that for the most part, he captured Lestat and made him his own.  The scene with the two blonds at the beginning was very Lestat-like.  He captured his innate curiosity and his arrogance, as well has appreciation of living human beauty.  It also helps that his stature and carriage and beauty is appropriate for the role.The actor who played David Talbot did well with the lack of character development.  He may have been a tad too young, but he played the concerned father-like archivist/researcher true to character.Now Marius, what a piss-poor job of putting this remarkable and wonderful character on the silver screen.  The actor, in spite of this, is very good. I hope to see him in more, and better, things.Aaliyah, may she rest in peace, easily captured her character and portrayed Akasha expertly.  Her early death has robbed Hollywood of an actress with potential.The lack of the story of the twins and the explanation of the Great Family, one of the main plots in the book, is reprehensible.  This part of the book explained Marius' role in the vampire hierarchy, as well as Maharet, Khayman, etc. value to the storyline.  It puts Jessie in a frame of reference.  Without it, her character has very little importance.On the same note, the omission of Mekare is just unfounded.  There was no reason whatsoever to cut her out.  Especially as she is essential to the end.The scenery, costumes, music, and all the behind-the-scenes type stuff was done well.  The sound of Lestat's rock group was excellent, very well done for the modernization of it.I thought that for a stand-alone, it doesn't function as well as IwtV did. Because of all the gaps in the story and lack of character development, I'm glad I've read the book to fill it in.All I'm going to say about the end is that it is completely wrong.  And while that worked for ""The Firm"", not so well for this one.In the words of Capt. Blackadder from ""Blackadder Goes Forth"":  ""Well, it started badly, and it, it tailed off a little in the middle, and the less said about the end, the better.  But, but, apart from that, excellent.""Well, maybe not ""excellent"", but maybe you'll like it anyway.  Afterward, read the book.  But just a warning, after this book, AR goes absolutely barking, and she loses her focus.  But this book is just amazing, one of my favorites.  Make up your own mind.",Queen of the Damned
274,diontelove,great movie,10,28 October 2004,"I have watched this movie at least a hundred times. It is fantastic. Aaliyah did a great job and so did the other actors. I am a fan of vampire movies an also of Aaliyah's work so for me it was a good combination. The title is a little misleading since the movie is not based around akasha but it is still a great movie. If you have not seen it yet, go out and buy the DVD. Personally I would have enjoyed seeing a bigger fight scene and more of them between akasha and the other elder vampires, I did not understand why they were so set on protecting mankind. They are the biggest group of vampires I have seen with consciouses. It was different, refreshing. Can't wait until Ann Rice makes another one.",Queen of the Damned
275,daniel_00_33,My favourite vampire movie!,10,25 November 2008,"Don't listen to the critics, seriously i loved the book and loved the movie even more! Stuart Townsend was incredible.. i had never seen him act so when you see Lestat for the first time you don't think oh thats just tom cruise in make-up... the image is much more believable this way.Aaliyah was beautiful and the fact that this is one of her last pieces of art made it that much more intensifying, especially given her role in this movie.Marguerite Moreau & Vincent Perez also play there roles quite strongly and fit the story line well.The plot gives a great mix of rock and horror, it brings alive not only the dream of being a vampire but also a rock-star. The soundtrack is wicked! For someone not interested in vampire movies or rock you probably wont enjoy it too much and why should you... However if your into both i highly recommend watching it! If you were really keen id even recommend reading the book first by Anne Rice.",Queen of the Damned
276,locholmez,This movie ruined my life,1,14 December 2005,"This is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. I can't BELIEVE it has an INCREDIBLE 4.6 here at IMDb. That makes it the most overrated piece of crap E V E R. Makes me sick!About three years ago, I was fooling around with this hot blonde in my class. We had been back and forth because of her insane boyfriend, which kept me from reaching my goals. However, they were also back and forth, and she broke up with him (like fifty times, but this time it seemed to be for real). So she finally agreed to watch a movie with me some Saturday night, in my home. Sex was REALLY in the air, and I had been trying to get into her pants FOREVER. Get it? FOREVER, damnit! She practically said ""Hey, we should have sex after that movie we're going to see.""... not that she hadn't been inviting before, but with the boyfriend out of the picture and everything, I figured this had to be it. And it probably would be..So before she shows up I had to get downtown to rent a movie. I remember seeing K-PAX in the shelf, and this ""Queen of the Damned"". I also remember reading the word ""erotic"" in a bi-sentence or something on the (Norwegian) back cover. Seemed perfect for the occasion, so I rented it.I got back home, she showed up (first and last time she set foot inside my house). We started watching the movie. Needless to say, a movie has the power to change an atmosphere completely. It can be a great way to get things going with someone. It doesn't have to be sexual or romantic, anything exciting or just funny usually gets the atmosphere right for more flirting, and so on. Even some bad movies might work; if you can start making fun of it in some way, it might kill off the nervous tensions and break the ice.Queen of the Damned failed miserably at everything. Not only did it NOT break ANY ice, it killed off all hope by adding several layers! It seemed like we sat there for ten hours scratching our faces, not being able to communicate. When the pain was over, she left within 15 minutes.I can't describe with my poor English vocabulary how painful this movie was. I didn't get in anybody's pants, AND it was actually awkward to see her again the next Monday. As I'm typing this, she's pregnant with her about-seven-years-older-than-me-with-a-sports-car-and-tattoo dumb-ass new boyfriend. THANK YOU, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED!",Queen of the Damned
277,rrodscott,Call it a derivative of Rice's novels,6,28 April 2019,"Alright, most of the bad reviews are linked to the fact that this movie isn't an attempt by a studio to duplicate a single Rice book on film. However, this film takes some of the more interesting aspects of two Rice books and uses those elements as the basis of a movie.
If someone made accurate movie representations of ""The Vampire Lestat"", and ""Queen of the Damned,"" and then released a two-hour enhanced highlights feature that described both movies, this movie would be the highlights version.
Fans of the books will remember that Lestat was a kind of musical trickster who didn't agree with how he was described in IV, and this movie shows a completely different aspect of his character, while at the same time introducing viewers to some of the more interesting characters in Rice's Chronicles.
Aaliyah, Townsend, Moreau, Perez and especially Lena Olin all managed to use their screen time to create memorable and mostly genuine representations of Rice's characters, which wasn't easy in a movie that as as free-form as this one.
I think people who watch this movie will be drawn to Rice's books in an effort to better understand these characters, instead of the other way around, and that's not a bad thing.",Queen of the Damned
278,janeweed717,amazing display of feminine power,9,16 November 2007,"I love this movie, mostly for Aaliyah's incredible performance as the newly revived Queen of the Vampires who is brought back to life and begins to stalk the Earth in search of the perfect mate. The scene in the modern-day vampire bar when she comes slinking in in her archaic glory is iconic: when the young male vampire approaches and threatens her, she calmly rips his heart right out of his chest and starts to eat it ... Admittedly, the ensuing attack on her by modern-day vampire posers whom she handily dispatches is filmed in a less than convincing manner--for me these details are overwhelmed by the presence of this electrifying woman. Also, Anne Rice's idea to turn Lestat into a rock star was a stroke of brilliance that is acted out convincingly in this film. This movie is far more worthwhile than the film adaptation of ""Interview with a Vampire."" Aaliyah lives!",Queen of the Damned
279,sukadiction,disappointing,5,29 March 2002,"There are parts of the movie which I find quite visually beautiful, and I liked a lot of the music (though I just can't get used to Jonathan Davis's voice coming out of Stuart Townsend), but as a whole it left me pretty disappointed.  As a huge fan of the books, my main complaint is that I didn't really get a chance to care about any of the characters. First of all, there was way too much emphasis put on Jesse; I didn't care about her when I read the book, and secondly, Lestat (through no fault of Stuart Townsend), came off as possessing precious little personality. The fact that Lestat didn't have blonde hair is rather unnerving, but I am willing to forgive that blunder simply because Stuart Townsend is REALLY frickin' hot! Also, in comparison to ""Interview with the Vampire"", which was handled with oodles of class, this one came off feeling kinda cheesy, and I found myself laughing at times I probably wasn't supposed to. I will give the writers a smattering of credit though, simply because they had a hell of a lot of characters and events to squeeze into 100 minutes. All in all, the movie wasn't a total disaster, but it left me feeling pretty let down.",Queen of the Damned
280,saxangel,What a disappointment,2,24 February 2002,"There was alot of hype leading up to this movie because of the death of the lead lady.  This movie was so bad that I regret I wasted my money on it. It did have a few redeeming qualities. The effects, the costumes, and Stewart Townsend(but not for the role of Lestat.)",Queen of the Damned
281,Irene-14,Oh my God...,10,22 February 2002,"This movie rocks.  I just came from the 10:30 PM showing here in my town, and I am totally blown away.

282,Lindy-18,Loved it!,8,27 February 2002,"I went expecting to hate it ..from some of the things I read here..and I walked away loving it..the effects were great, the cast was well picked and I even enjoyed the story. Maybe it is the fact that I haven't read the book..so I wasn't expecting it to be in SOME way...anyway..I enjoyed it..I also enjoyed Interview With a Vampire! I thought both actors, Tom and this one, played their parts very well..I thought it was a great night of entertainment!",Queen of the Damned
283,jj87,Just too pretty and predictable. And no surprises lead to a mediocre movie.,3,22 February 2002,"Queen of the Damned started out slick, but as most vampire movies go, it became too predictable. There was a comment on how to kill the queen, and in the end, that's how the movie ended, which was another slick moment. It was just too predictable with the foreshadowing handed over. No surprises, at all, which is the key for this type of movie. However, the cast was impressive, but that just is not enough for a higher mark.",Queen of the Damned
284,paradox9,I admit it...I liked it.,8,1 March 2002,"Okay, so it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen. But I can't get it out of my head. I've read the books, and so I was a bit disappointed that tons of things were left out. But THIS IS A MOVIE!!! Tons of things from the book always get left out. So I can accept that. I saw this with another avid Rice reader and we compared notes all during and after the movie. However, Stuart Townsend was just a super Lestat. I never really liked Tom Cruise's Lestat as he seemed too much like Tom Cruise. But that's just my opinion. Anyways, it was an entertaining flick, and a chance to ""reunite"" with familiar characters despite the train wreck they made out of the plot. Rice purists will have a lot to gripe about after seeing this one. Fans of Interview with the Vampire should not expect QotD to be the same flick. First of all, it's a completely different movie with different director and cast. Second, Interview is told from Louis's point of view and is told with his tone. QotD is told mostly from Lestat's (in a way) and so it has his ""wild child"" tone to it. Different characters, different movies. Both very entertaining...",Queen of the Damned
285,netochka,"look sharp and act vaguely menacing, life for a vampire is a is not much more than a snappy editing and effects, a change of wardrobe, and usually an irksome accent",3,9 February 2002,"the mystery of the spoken language of the egyptians has been SOLVED, rejoice! they sounded as ALL vamps since Bela Lugosi, HUNGARIAN! it's in the blood, one must assume.early in the film, we were treated to a bit of a video, shot in a style reminiscent of the expressionistic german film, ""Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari"" which gave me high hopes for a visually stimulating night out. eh. you can only go so far with flashy MTV type editing, flash, and racket, if you saw the preview, that's as deep as it gets here.many of the scenes were awkward enough for the audience to laugh out loud, and this wasn't the effect in most cases.  Aaliyah Haughton succeeded in her role, which consisted of keeping her wig on and softly undulating in bronze bodypaint. there was little more required of the actors, looking good visually and possessing a vaguely badass attitude was enough in most cases, as it is in most music videos. life for a vamp is burdened by a never ending change of wardrobe and usually an irksome accent.  not a lot of introspection here, which you would think a 400+ yr vampire would have had some opportunity for.the other plot possibility was the ""meddling kid"" talamasca, a bit thin on the characterization, and somewhat unbelievable. one character followed her obsession to request full knowledge of the experience of a vamp. this woman, who we are to believe is DRIVEN for knowledge, rapidly backpedaled when offered the opportunity to become a vamp after a demonstration of ""a light snack in the park after dark"". this woman was an EXPERT, having studied lestat from his own DIARY, did she think he drank slim fast to stay looking so thin and chic?  the fans of the Anne Rice books will be disappointed, as the story is further diluted by the direction and the choice to make this as flash as possible.roland s. howard and hugo race were featured in the film. look QUICKLY, as their role in the BAR band consists of a quick tracking shot in the ""admiral's arms"" and one fleeting close up reaction shot before he and the rest of the barflies buy the farm. go rent ""der Himmel über Berlin"" one more time if you want more than this.

288,rey_nadia,not according to the book,8,19 December 2006,"What I recommend is that you read the book, it's probably the best one in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. The movie is not very faithful to the book, it's more like a joint a story of The Vapire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. Actually I would say it is BASED on The Vapire Lestat rather than Queen of the Damned. Watch the movie, and THEN read the book, it's really better if you do it in this order: read the book first and you will not appreciate the movie. I know I didn't. I've grown to love Anne Rice and her Vampire Chronicles and I hated the dark-hair Lestat, whose hair should have been blond and long, and I also hated the fact that the movie presented Marius as the maker of Lestat, instead of Magnus. I also can't imagine why the movie did not include Maharet's sister, Mekare, who played a huge role in the book. The movie is good, I would say even great, but don't compare it to the book too much..",Queen of the Damned

It's a movie, not a book, and certain artistic interpretations have to be gained and lost by the transition from book to movie. Also, notice how it says ""based"" on the novel. It doesn't say, ""exact replica of the novel"". So as it stands alone as a movie, it's entertaining(granted, that doesn't mean it's good necessarily, but if it's entertaining, it can't be all bad). Plus, it has vampires, and biting, and blood, and good music, and more vampires, and more blood, and more biting, and hot girls, and more vampires*gush*. And for those of you who wish it was a sequel to Interview, it's not. It's not meant to be. They are two completely different types of movies. I read a local review saying that QotD is just a very long music video, what's wrong with that? It's just a different way to make a movie. Sorry it isn't Schindler's List. So for those of you in want of an entertaining movie, with a great soundtrack, featuring Static-X, Deftones, David Draimon, etc., that has lots of vampires, biting, blood, and hot girls, Queen of the Damned is very cool.",Queen of the Damned

I'd say it's good enough to see again, but not to watch over and over, as it's one of those you'd get sick of easy. The actors did their parts great. It was believable, dark, and sexy.

It is quite unfortunate, since the original novels provide enough excellent material for two or three feature films.Even the beauty of Marguerite Moreau cannot absolve the film of its cluttered pretensions.

This poor girl Aaliyah's performance was really bad for such an important character. But again.

After visiting the movies' website and finding several key characters missing, or horribly miscast I wanted to know just how bad the film was going to be. And it was worse then a nightmare.In adapting a book to a screenplay I understand that creative liberties are taken and important to telling the story in a purely visual format. But this movie was so changed I didn't even recognize the story!The pace of the story seemed to be forced and twisted off from the books plot unnecessarily. The personalities or histories of the characters, such as LeStat, Jesse and Marius are so altered that they are Anne Rices' characters only by name. And missing characters so important, like Mekare - put huge holes in the storyline. The vampires seemed to fall to the stero typical Hungarian sort, even Queen Akashas' Egyptian heritage was replaced by a poor accent and over the top dialogue. Although with one exciting development (warning SPOILER) the Queen was strong enough to walk in the daylight and was even able to share her gift with LeStat! The visions of Akashas' perfect world and her steps to make it were abandoned in favor of a blood hungry vampire who fed in extreme. Also cut from the story is HOW Akasha became Queen of the Damned - which seemed to miss the point of the story completely. It seemed that the rich story was cut in favor of some fancy visual effects, catch phrases and pretty posing. Along with some crazy casting choices the acting was for the most part weak.It was by far the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.",Queen of the Damned
305,Slatan9,Anne Rice Fans beware..,4,26 February 2002,"I tried to give this film a break, I took my wife with me (she has never read a book from Rice) to give me her opinion on the movie.  Her exact words I can't even put here, they are really that bad. The plot line changes from the book didn't work in the movie, they made no sense to anyone.  From the changes in how Lestat was made a vampire to the ending (while visually stunning) left the viewer with too many disjointed fragments that never make any sense.   Akasha (Aaliyah) did a great job, but it is sorry to note that is about all I can say of the cast (maybe the cast members should have read the book instead of watching a few vampire movies for their inspiration). An `A' for effort to the writers and producers in not fearing the ` Rice Wrath ` in making changes to the story line, but sorry you Flunked out because they didn't work. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) ends up looking like a rip off of Jim Morrison of the doors.  The Talamasca looks like some sort of thrown together club for a `Hidden Camera' show.  I kept waiting for Marius (Vincent Perez) to start rapping and putting on the `Colors', or at least steal a car throughout the entire thing.  As for the rest of the cast, well, who was the rest of the cast?  While the other members in the book are an integral part of the ending, they are no more than cheerleaders that could have been completely skipped in the movie and no one but a Rice fan would know.If you are a dedicated Anne Rice fan, wait for the Bargain Shows to have it, or the video store.If you know nothing of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, then you may B rate the movie at best, although much mind altering drugs may help that rating.",Queen of the Damned

I read the book and knew beforehand the movie did not follow the book very closely (as basically none of the character's physical features were kept true to the book).  If I had paid to see this movie, I would want my money back.  This has to be one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.For those who have not read the book and/or are not Anne Rice fans: if you really want to see it, don't expect much from the script or from Aaliyah's acting.  The story seems very shallow and skips around without really giving any character or situation any depth.  The movie has a bright spot with songs from Jonathan Davis of Korn, Godhead, Deftones, and more.For those Anne Rice fans: Do not see this movie unless you want to walk away mad and with your head shaking.  The fact that they changed so much from the book is astounding.  Let me give you some examples.  Lestat has brown hair and eyes.  Maharet does not have red hair, but luckily Jesse does.  There is no Legend of the Twins, and there are no twins- just Maharet.  The origin of the vampires is not told or even hinted at.  Louis, Gabriel, and Daniel are omitted from the movie.  Marius makes Lestat and teaches him all about being a vampire (but in Interview, weren't we told Lestat learned nothing from his maker?  Hum.) Marius is never trapped in ice.  Jesse longs to become a vampire and it is Lestat who turns her into one, she is never injured.  Armand has a minute of screen time, in which he is a blond haired fop.  When Akasha massacred, they were men and women.  There is no ""female liberation"" is this movie.  David Talbot is young.  Akasha kills Pandora by making her burst into flames. Akasha dies when Lestat, Armand, Maharet suck her dry and because Maharet got the last drop, she is now stone.In addition to all this, the opening credits and first 10 minutes or so are pure cheese.  The theater was laughing at its corniness.  Other scenes seem silly, though they were not intended to be this way.  Lestat lacks the fire and cockiness that Tom Cruise's character possessed.  Every character is a very watered down version of what they should be.  It was also just so lovely to hear Aaliyah speak every word with a Dracula accent.
Basically, if you are going to spend any money on Queen of the Damned, spend it on the soundtrack, not this butchered, Hollywood version of a great book.",Queen of the Damned

I expected more excitement, more horror, just more, I guess and it never happened.  I left the theater unfulfilled.  Must say that I did love the soundtrack -- great mix of contemporary hard music lent itself well to the feel of the movie.",Queen of the Damned
308,imtbarker,Faithful to the book,8,24 February 2002,"Having read the book definitely helps in understanding the plot, but in appreciating the characters. If you haven't read the book, this is just another vampire movie. I'm very disappointed they didn't tell the twins' story, but... I liked it a lot.",Queen of the Damned
309,okami092002,Damned Be The Viewer...,5,26 February 2002,"I went to see `Queen of the Damned'  on its opening night with a simple expectation: to be entertained.  Yes, I have read the books (all the way up to `Memnoch the Devil'), but I was fully aware that, unlike the film version of `Interview With A Vampire', `Queen's screenplay was not written by Anne Rice nor did any of the stars from that project appeared in this cinematic installment.  But I am not going to get into how much the film diverted from the book (which is expected with  adapting one format to the other) but on the film alone.  Rest assured, other Anne Rice fans have already nit-picked by now, already. ;)First off, the acting was not bad.  Aalyah was the PERFECT Akasha and deserves any awards she is nominated for this role, her last performance.Stewart Townsend was, visually, a superb Lestat, however, his excessive posing and blank `Bono-like' stares were just a little annoying and got in the way of his performance in some scenes.  The rest of the cast did workmen-like performances.However, I fault mostly the script, which was, in of itself, hard to follow. For a movie titled `Queen of the Damned'  we know far more about Lestat than we do Akasha.  So much is left out that even HOW she became a vampire (the Mother of ALL Vampires, at that)  is missing!  Plus, there's the attempted forced love interest between Lestat and the mortal Talamascan Jesse, the rather rushed flash-backs of Lestat's past, and other undeveloped characters (did anyone even KNOW that the other three vampires were Pandora, Armand, and Mael?).  Add to the confusing focus of the direction of the film (is this a Vampire flick, a Alternative/Goth Video, or a kung-fu/Buffy the Vampire flick?) with its  nausiating, overused crane and helicopter shots for most of the scene changes, you have a patch-worked film that just feels as though it was rushed to be released and tried to compensate (and failed, CGI and all) substance with style.",Queen of the Damned
310,littlevlahgirl,more holes then swiss cheese,7,18 March 2002,"Ok I'm not an Anne Rice purist. Quite frankly it took a long time for me to pick up the Vampire Lestat after the absolute chore it was to read Interview. But if you are going to make a movie based off a book or a series of books at least pick a shorter book or make a longer movie! Half the plot was missing! There are more characters in the book then in the movie, or so I thought. Half of them show up in the credits, but you'd never know they were there since there was hardly any character development. And what was the deal with Maharet and Akasha? Can we possibly get some clue as to their connection before we have this big showdown???  If you haven't read the books then you'll probably like the movie. I have to say once I let go of the whole ""it's not at all like the book"" thinking it was actually rather enjoyable. Stuart Townsend,in my opinion, was a great choice for Lestat especially compared with the ham job Tom Cruise did in Interview. Stuart actually came off as mysterious, sexy, and lethal. Aaliyah was beautiful as Akasha, but I think it would have come off better if they hadn't used sound effects to give her this big spooky voice. They had some good visuals and the soundtrack was very cool. I had to laugh at the bit spot they gave to Jonathan Davis as a ticket scalper. All in all not as bad as I expected. I will probably get the DVD and definately get the soundtrack.",Queen of the Damned
311,imcholly,Did Anne Rice like this movie?,3,22 March 2002,"I did not really like this movie because it really roughly followed the books.  I have read all of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and I really respect every thing about them.  That is why this movie got to me so much. For one thing, Marius did not make Lestat, this vampire Magnus did.  Now I know that it is just a movie but to take the books Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned, and come out with a movie this choped up, is just wrong.  I think any true Anne Rice fan would hate this movie because of how chopped it is, but if your looking for a fun will directed Vampire movie then is the Queen of the Damned.  And if you have not read the books see the movie first so you are not so mad at the end of it.  The one thing that I really like was Jonathan Davis' Lyrics and background vocals for Lestats sing.  This movie had it ups and down like all movies do but I would have to say that it was entertaining to watch because you did see Lestat come to life, Stuart Townsend was great for the part, except for his black hair, Lestat has long blonde hair, but he was good for Lestat de Lioncourt.",Queen of the Damned
312,cureton,"Although incorrectly titled, a supremely entertaining movie",10,22 April 2002,"Having read and loving the Vampire Chronicles, I had to force myself to enter the theater with no expectations.  (I was lucky enough to see Interview before reading it.  The proper way to do it.)  What I got out of Queen of the Damned was a wonderful movie that was BASED ON THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES.  I emphasize this because the movie was as far from the novel as night is from day.  The entirety of the events in the movie Queen of the Damned took place in the novel The Vampire Lestat.  And there are elements from other Anne Rice books (The Talamasca) thrown in for spice.  But, this movie perfectly blends the music, setting, acting and directing in order to show the vampire world as it should be experienced.  Fun, exciting, thrilling, and totally engrossing, this is an incredible movie that I've gone to see again and again.

Not even close.,5,26 December 2007,"Anyone who is even somewhat familiar with Anne Rice's book ""Queen of the damned"", the vampire chronicles in general, or any of the characters therein, will be disappointed with this movie. Anyone who isn't familiar with the book, or her work in general sadly wont rush to read any of it based on this movie. The only thing this movie shares with the book by the same title is , well... the title. In short everything from the plot to the characters (with the exception of their names) has been changed. To list the ways in which the movie falls short of the book would be an almost endless task. That said, the movie on it's own (with no comparison to the book / story from which it was derived) is at best teetering the line of ""worth watching"". The acting isn't bad, the soundtrack is good, and for those who like vampires - a little blood is spilled. However, in changing the original storyline and characters of the books the story gets botched and the movie seems choppy at best. So I wouldn't go into it with high hopes of a great storyline.

They were both great actors, both very convincing and both really attractive.

If you want the book, go read it!  If you haven't read the book, do so!  The actors are near perfect visual representations of their parts.  If you have read the book, then you should have been able to fill in the parts that were missing and enjoyed the film for what it was.

318,bubblefyfe,A let down,1,18 July 2008,"I was actually looking forward to seeing this film, as I had been pleasantly surprised by Interview with the Vampire's adaptation. Though not a massive Anne Rice fan, I enjoyed both The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned and thought I would enjoy the film.I was wrong.I think possibly I would have enjoyed the film much more if I hadn't read the books. The vast majority of the plot has been left out due to time restraints on a contract or something like that, so there is no legend of the twins, and Lestat's actual maker Magnus is not mentioned at all. But none of this annoyed me as much as the fact I spent the whole film patiently waiting for my two favourite characters to show up, those being Louis and Armand. Louis didn't appear at all for some good awful reason, and although I was told Armand made a brief cameo appearance I didn't work out who he was until after I'd seen the film. Daniel was also left out completely, and Pandora, Khayman and Mael were cut down big-time. Marius' character was butchered. Now, I've only read the books twice in the past 3 years, so I fail to see how I managed to see what gaping holes these emissions left in the plot line and the writers didn't. I just didn't get Jesse and Lestat. In the context of the film, yea, it sorta made sense, but to anyone who read the book it was just weird, to be honest. Stuart Townsend did a good job as Lestat, and although I do think Tom Cruise was better, you can't really take the fact that Townsend is GODLIKE in the looks department away from himThough I am giving this film 1/10, I can maybe, POSSIBLY see why someone who hadn't read the books might enjoy it to some extent. Nonetheless, i think overall it was just a massacre of 2 very good book.",Queen of the Damned
319,remifasolati,Much better than I'd been led to believe.,7,25 November 2002,"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the major players from the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the music was faithful to Anne Rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but I thought it was a nice supplement.I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.

Otherwise, yes, it was a little crappy with representing the rest of the events in the book, but oh well! It was a twenty first century interpretation, what do we expect? I've seen countless recent movies that deserve a 4.7 rating more than this one does!!

However, if - like me - you had read the series...you likely knew what you were getting into when you let your curiosity override your better judgement and watched this monstrosity.The casting was so poor it was actually amusing. Lestat, whose blonde hair and ironically good-natured personality have been reduced to a sullen, uninspired and dark-haired Stuart Townsend. Akasha, a queen of the old-world nile...arrogant, and self-righteous, played by a R&B star whose take on the role seems to be her best (bad) Bela Lugosi impression. (Nile Hungarians?) The ever-pale and very red-headed Maharet represented by raven-haired Lena Olin?The writers of this schlock also apparently didn't pay very close attention to the Cliff Notes they used for reference. Glaring omissions can be understood given the (ridiculous) challenge of combining two of the novels, however wholesale changes to the story abound...so much so I can't imagine how Rice let this horror into theatres without massive protest.
Toss in extremely poor acting, cheeseball atmosphere that would have Corman wincing, and enough Mtv trendy styling to host a Spring Break party...and I felt more than sufficiently punished for ignoring my instincts. I'm just thankful I didn't shell out any money for this.",Queen of the Damned

There is lot of very bad movies about vampire and they have great ratings here, so I don't get how this great movie is rated so poor. I've seen this movie many many times now and still love to watch it like the first time. Lestat and Queen Akasha are totally sexy Vampires, dark and cruel.

First of all it's based on half the story (the book before it in the series ""The Vampire Lestat"" ended with the beginning of ""Queen of the Damned"") They left out main characters, omitted the histories, and even changed how Lestat became a vampire, what was left out of ""Interview With The Vampire"" felt like they just needed to fit into some time constraints, what they did with ""Queen of the Damned"" was a hack and slash job. Even taking it separately from the book, it was at best mediocre. The characters were two dimensional, and bland, and the plot was boring and unconnected.

The acting was par at best, the storyline was a mess as was the CGI work. For some insane reason I watched the whole thing, waiting for a good plot twist or a bit of excitement, it never came. A good, albeit totally predictable soundtrack (plenty of nu-metal, goth, and hard rock tracks), was the only shining light in this mess.In summary, if you are a huge goth/vampire fan/vampire you may find this mildly entertaining.

If you've never read the books, don't watch the movie, you won't understand what's going on.

The Interview with the Vampire is one of my favorite movies. But this is the worst movie I have ever seen! Since they were making Queen of the Damned they SHOULD have had Anne Rice do the screen play and not some 2 other dudes. Anne Rice did the screen play for Interview with the Vampire and it was great, even though some parts were changed they wernt drastic changes and it didnt make a difference because the story was still the same as the book.  It seems as if they only got a summary of the movie and never actually read the book. They changed WAY TOO MUCH for it to be acceptable. They changed important things, like who made Lestat. They were way too vague of how the Queen was made a vampire and how it all started and why they wanted to kill the Queen. They didnt fully introduce all the characters. Like near the end the have , some might I add, of the vampires that are there when they kill the Queen and they were never introduced of who the heck they were! Seriously, if you wanna KNOW the REAL story of the Queen of the Damned, READ THE BOOK, it is a VERY GOOD BOOK.

Also, even if I wasn't a huge fan of Anne Rice and didn't read any of her books, I still wouldn't have liked it. It lacked a plot. It was very sugar coated. It barely went into detail in anything. As an Anne Rice fan, I know that all of Anne Rice's work is very detailed and precise, which is one thing that I really enjoy about her books.

My opinion, it was the best movie I've ever seen, and my favorite.

333,markiskenny,Good vampire movie. Does not follow book.,6,5 February 2007,"First let me say this: If it weren't for Anne Rice's artistic and beautiful vision of the modern day vampire, I would have ZERO interest in Vampire novels. ""Interview With the Vampire"" was a gorgeous movie that almost, closely follows the book's plot. One could read ""Interview"" and then watch the movie and not be disappointed. Now comes ""The Queen of the Damned."" The upside to this movie is that it was a good vampire film. The downside is that it had very little to do with the book and completely mutilated the actual book's plot. I was very disappointed in this. Why did the director completely avoid the story of the red-haired twins? Marius did not make Lestat! Lestat and Jessie do not end up together in the book. Maharet does not turn into a pillar of salt at the end of the book (well, that's what she looked like in the movie). Lestat does not get the violin from a gypsy on a beach. This movie had the potential of being an ""Artistic"" vision of the book, but it ended up being a campy, rock and roll MTV vampire story that didn't capture anything close to the spirit of the book. I think the fans deserved something more. Overall, this is a decently made good vampire movie  but it could have been done as ANY vampire movie. I just don't think the Anne Rice fans deserved this. I think SOMEBODY needs to step forth and take all of her books and turn them into a new set of movies that actually do the books justice.",Queen of the Damned

Anne Rice has created and incredible and intricate world of seductive Un-life, and this movie destroys it's soul. I give it a 2 out of ten only out of pity: I wish the series did not die when Tom Cruise refused his role as Lestat. This is a movie to watch at your own peril. It combines too many of her books in the same, short, skinny movie. It is tragic, however, that the main character, a beautiful and talented woman, died in the making. I think that this only compounds the issue. If you've ever read any of Anne Rices' Vampire novels, or any of her work for that matter, you know that this oversimplifies her created world. If you've got a movie that explores only one book of an author, The Interview with a Vampire, and it lasts just a bit over 2 hours, how can you justify a movie that summarizes 4 books in a little over 1 hour?",Queen of the Damned

The actors, the raped script, the corny music etc. This can't be Anne Rice, can it?Stuart Townsend was so much better in his role as Dorian Gray. Why did he ever want to compete with Tom Cruise? In my mind, Lestat is Lestat, not some cheesy youth-idol prettyboy as Stuart is. Yeah, he had his tight leather pants on, vow, he must be good then! Lol.

This is only undermined by Lestat falling in love with a human girl called Jesse, who wants to be a vampire herself. Her curiosity leads her to have several meetings with the elusive vampire Lestat.

Queen of the Damned is only loosely based on the original and there are some significant changes to the story and certain characters, even to the extreme of characters being left out completely.I myself am a huge fan of the books, but am also realistic enough to accept that the books contain such detail that they do not lend themselves easily to screen, except perhaps in the form of a film series such as The Lord of the Rings. So, as a stand alone vampire movie that is heavily influenced by the book, any grievances can be left outside.The film's story (spoilers!) in brief then, tells us about Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has been at rest for decades but stimulated by the sounds of the time he rises, soon becoming the front-man of a successful metal band. Publicly admitting that he is a vampire and revealing vampire secrets within his lyrics soon draws the attention of the authorities, both of the living and the un-dead. It even wakes up the original vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), a very different creature to the rest of them, with near god like powers and an insatiable blood lust.We learn of Lestat's past life and of his creator Marius (Vincent Perez). We also meet a few of the other Ancients, namely Maharet, as the aunt of another main character, the Talamaskan Jesse who develops a fascination with Lestat. Jesse is the link the ancients have to the living but she soon becomes caught in the middle of the action.Marius therefore is a change from the book where he is not Lestat's creator, and the changes don't end there, however he is a compelling character and is well played by Perez. The plot is far from complex and has holes, but then it was never intended on being taken too seriously. Accept it for what it is and not what it isn't. It is not an accurate adaptation of the book to film, but as a stand-alone vampire movie inspired by it, what's left is a decent and entertaining vampire movie.The soundtrack of the movie is from Jonathan Davis of Korn, and other famous names from the industry including Maralyn Manson feature so the movie gives a very credible musical contribution from what is ultimately a fictitious rock band. This aspect is worth consideration after all, as if it had not been good, this film could have stunk!",Queen of the Damned
338,HotPinkHooligan,Vampire rock-stardom at it's very best!,8,19 December 2006,"This movie, while poorly received by fans of the book(Whose taste we should question anyway, simply because they ARE fans of Anne Rice's poorly constructed work), was supremely entertaining, and has long-since earned a permanent spot on my top shelf. The casting was rather good, even though it doesn't compare to 1994's 'Interview with the Vampire' (I mean, it IS hard to compete with Brad Pitt). But, most of all, the...SOUNDTRACK. The music for this movie is a amazing, and was produced/performed by very talented and well-known individuals. (Including THE Jonathan Davis).

When I got up at the end I heard someone saying, ""That was the worst film I've ever seen"". It is just being marketed to make money from Aaliyah's death. It's very disrespectful, especially the ending. Don't waste your money, it's boring, badly acted, and shouldn't have been allowed by her family. The book is MUCH better.",Queen of the Damned
340,splhcb78,Visual Guide for Those who have Read them All,7,27 February 2002,"Aaliyah's delightful as the Queen Akasha.  They cast the vampires young, as Anne does in her books.  But they change too much story to satisfy the faithful, and leave out too much story for the uninitiated.  However, for those who have read the books, this will be a delightful visual companion to the series.  They capture much of what we have all read about (the blood-swoon drunkedness, the marble-like appearance of Enkil and Akasha, the speed at which the vampires move, etc.) with technical achievement - but David Talbot seems to have already lived through ""Body Thief"" - it's story items like this that make it difficult to figure out how they will deal with any of the other novels, and further confuse those who haven't read Ms. Rice's work.  Will they treat all of them as a separate story?  Who knows, but if you are a fan of Anne Rice, you will enjoy yourself.  If you haven't, bring someone who has, at least to explain the ending!",Queen of the Damned

This was an entertaining tale of the conflicts in the vampire community...kept me watching, even though I have never been much of a horror fan...reminds me of my first visit to the Rocky Horror show, but with a different slant with the music ....All the actors were all above caliber...who was that gypsy girl with the violin?...Aaliyah, you are missed...her early accidental death in an airplane crash is sad and will be a loss for future film effortsIf you do not like Vampire films, you will like this one...This novel by Anne Rice and the screen play translation by Scott Abbott was excellent....In summary, well done with credit to all",Queen of the Damned
343,Tabyathe,It's about time!,9,8 April 2002,"Yes, indeed it was about time that a book-to-movie was done properly. Granted, it took two books to put one movie together, but those fans of _The Vampire Chronicles_ by Anne Rice, have been waiting with baited breath to see Akasha and Lestat brought into the proper light. If you haven't read the books, the movie gives you enough history that you can follow along the storyline. If you have read the books, then you finally get to see the atmosphere and hear the voices that until now have been ghostly echoes in our heads. Stuart Townsend was perfect as Lestat. Head to toe and back again: vicious and mysterious and bold. Aaliyah brought Akasha an age-old beauty that few others could have done so well. She will be missed. I enjoyed this movie greatly! I've seen it twice and intend to go a few more times! Forget the popcorn, though, it just gets caught between your fangs...",Queen of the Damned
344,MtlVegan,Don't be sucked in: this movie is bloody awful!,6,20 February 2002,"Much-hyped vampire film fails to live up to to the bill. Entire movie feels like a MTV video, as we watch Lestat (Townsend) lead Marilyn Manson look-a-likes as the ridiculous pretext for the vampire story. Director Michael Rymer brought us such other flops as Perfume (2001) and In Too Deep (1999). Aaliyah's last screen appearance is wasted in what amounts to little more than a few words in 10 minutes screen time. The only scary thing about this film is how it managed to be made.",Queen of the Damned
345,jaesonk,This movie bites...,1,2 March 2002,"Let's not beat around the bush, this movie sucked more than the vampires in it.  Ignore for the moment the awful translation of Anne Rice's work into this celluloid mess.  You can still make a great movie based loosely on a novel and take liberties.  But this movie didn't even achieve that.  The characters & their performances were bad.  Perhaps that's just the extension of poor direction and a worse script.  There were very few moments when Townsend could connect with the Lestat character and even less for the other characters/actors.  If I were Cruise, I'd have turned down the offer too. There was so much more life to the performances in ""Interview"".  I hope that someday, someone with more talent can deliver a better movie translation of these novels than the ""direct-to-video"" quality of QOTD.Take this coffin and put it in the sunlight where it belongs.Jaeson K.",Queen of the Damned
346,grneyz,Wait! Those five seconds were from the book!,1,25 February 2002,"If you liked Showgirls, you just may like this film.  If you have read any of the Vampire Chronicles, this will make you cringe.  Myself, I was laughing so hard tears were streaming down my face.  The vampires speak.... so.... slowly...with....such.......fake....emotion.  Egad.  As  literary adaptation....well, i don't think they referred to the book much, so I won't either.  The dialogue was so vampire cliche, and the plot was so nearly non-existent that it played like fan fiction.  Bad fan fiction.  As for the cast, Stuart Townshend is unbearably sexy, but I can't help feeling that all of the actors were directed to exhibit no feelings and to walk around in ""i'm a vampire"" mode.  I was disappointed that such a vital, sexual actor was misused.  Overall, if you go into this knowing you're about to witness a train wreck, it can be an enjoyable experience.",Queen of the Damned
347,acilva,Worth the price of the ticket...,7,22 February 2002,"The special effects were great, I loved the way the vampires would fly through the air.  Costuming was done very well.  And the soundtrack is just fantastic.  As far as the cast goes, overall good casting.  Stuart Townsend made a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise, despite the changing accent. Townsend doesn't match the physical description of Lestat but he definitely had the attitude.  I really enjoyed Townsend's performance.  All in all, it was a good show.",Queen of the Damned
348,Akira-43,Read up before you critique...,10,1 March 2002,"First off, before you critique a movie, it's a good thing to have your ducks in a row regarding the director's vision of the movie.  Those who bothered to read up on the movie would know that Jorge Saralegui did not make this movie as a sequel to 'Interview', and that he intended for the movie to make an entirely different kind of statement than the first. As well, each movie is, in itself, a different story.  Remaining true to the novel is not always possible, and is sometimes impossible due to time constraints and intricacies of plot development that do not come easily to the screen.Having said this, I believe the movie was very well done, and captured the characters' personalities quite well.  The interpretation from the original book was appropriate, even if some of the characters' roles had to be left out.  The sets were lush and the camera work was well done, providing a lot of eye candy for most scenes.  The acting is effective and thought provoking.  All in all, a decently done movie I would recommend to anyone with the ability to appreciate the darkness the director provides.",Queen of the Damned
349,desslok-2,"Good movie, too short",9,9 February 2002,"Queen of the Damned really seemed to be a merging of some content from both the Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned novels.  I think it stressed Lestat much more that Akasha, but I believe that is due to the untimely death of Aaliyah, which occurred before filming ended.  Had she lived, this would have been a truly spectacular movie.  Nevertheless, the effects and acting are impressive, and the actors seems well suited to their roles. Stuart Townsend makes a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise.",Queen of the Damned
350,joseph_01,Awesome Movie,10,25 February 2002,"I'm not sure whether people have seen the same movie as I have so I don't understand what there is NOT to like about it. Everyone was played excellently. The movie did not follow the books exactly and as an Anne Rice Fan, that ticked me off; however, the movie was still quite excellent. I enjoyed it so much I've seen it twice and still want to see it again. The imagery and music still play in my mind everyday. Obviously, the good reviewers and bad reviewers each believe they know how vampires should be portrayed. I think both Interview and this movie portray them as they should be; past and present. Although Tom Cruise played Lestat well in the first movie, Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat as he also should have been played; sensual, dangerous, and emotional. A definite must-see for vampire fans.",Queen of the Damned
351,out_ofthe_crypt,I love the movie!,10,26 May 2006,"I thought Queen of the Damned was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only did it cater to my vampire interests I got my Stuart Townsend fix as well. The music is spectacular & I love Lestat! The plot line was a little all over the place but if you've read the Vampire Chronicles it should be fairly easy to follow. Personally I thought the special effects suited the film. The make-up and costume of the various vampires in the movie were outstanding and really makes you believe that there could be vampires out there. Once again, the music is amazing, Jonathan Davis is a genius! Stuart performed so well in the concert scenes making it very realistic and I could almost feel like I was there watching. All the supporting actors did a wonderful job and I think Marguerite Moreau is a great Jesse. Aaliyah makes for an intriguing and beautiful Akasha, as well as Marius & Maharet being played exceptionally. I could just think about Lestat all day......",Queen of the Damned
352,sanchezcarlos123,queen of the damned was all right,7,2 May 2006,"In Queen of The Damned,Akasha(Aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger,demanding presence, she just caught your eye and attention. now the movie did have faults, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past. What i also Did not like was the that the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was/ or was like.Akasha's (Aaliyah's) role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off, her(Akasha's) death came 2 quickly.But i liked how Akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The ancients was rather boring (they killed Akasha in like 2 secs).Akasha's head got knocked off in 1 sec and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world.Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not have picked a better Akasha or Lestat.

354,rb46628,So bad that I was compelled to come back!,5,24 February 2002,"Let's just pause for a moment to appreciate the shear awfulness of this movie. Good. Now, let's take a moment to go over how much I thoroughly enjoyed this.Why? Because, just as 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' was good, unclean, campy fun, 'The Queen of the Damned' is a Vampire Chronicles blessing. You can just see the filmmakers giggling as they went through the dailies and shaking their heads ""Man, we are going to p*** of *so* many Anne Rice fans.""To be fair, Stuart Townsend was *excellent*. Bloody brilliant. He was younger and prettier and more charismatic than Tom Cruise ever could have been in his part as Lestat (though Cruise's rendition was also uniquely commendable). The costumes were superb (the same designer from 'Moulin Rouge' pulled this delightful set of vampire garb) and I would go back just to sketch the clothes. Aaliyah was wonderfully camp, playing her motions as if in pantomime and echoing a Dracula-esque tone.Jesse was miscast, but who cares! This movie produced more pure laughs than Hollywood's most recent comedies.All of this doesn't make a good movie, however, just an entertaining one. Laugh at the deadpan one-liners and oogle the yummy silk and velvets. It's a fun little ride.",Queen of the Damned
355,LestatLouis,Entertaining and wild,10,22 February 2002,"Woohoo, what a wild ride. I'm not even sure what I really expected but it sure paid off. A friend who I dragged along said that it all looked ""like a big video game"" referring to the vast number of scenes that span across a large terrain  making it look and feel like you're inside.To start I must say that Stuart really captured the ""Lestat"" look, he very sexy as my friend remarked, and I must agree, wow!!! I did not see anything wrong with his accent I actually enjoyed his part the most in the whole movie. He captures Lestat and his wayward ways perfectly, and his skin looks beautiful in the movie. The concert scene was very well done and the song ""System"" playing along, while Akasha killed the vampires, was a nice touch. The little Jesse was adorable and the grownup was also compelling. Marguerite Moreau pulls off her part with a lot of flair and innocence, she's probably the only innocent in the whole movie. Akasha was physically enchanting though it was hard to make out the dialogue especially when she and Lestat were on the beach. Even though her role is not overly large she  holds your attention when she is on screen. I enjoyed the scene when Lestat crawl away from the groupies and then crawls up the wall, very nice. Also when Lestat is listening to music lying in his coffin and then he realizes another vampire is in his mansion that is also very for lack of a better word, yummy :). The ancients who were barely featured seemed very reserved and not enough lines for them all, if they had any. I counted only about three lines from Armand, and Matthew Newton did resemble a ""pretty girl"" as my friend interjected. I think he was a pretty good Armand in appearance, he did not speak enough to find out if his character was very complex and dark, like it is. I like that Lestat calls his band ""my children"", very paternal and sweet of him, if Lestat can ever be sweet :) Also his biting sarcasm and humor worked well for the movie especially the line: ""Sorry I'm late, I was trying to catch my breakfast."" And when Maudy (a band member) first saw Lestat and was surprised about his statement that he was a vampire: Maudy-""Vampire, that's funny."" and Lestat's reply: ""Yes, it's hilarious."" Some of the special effects were a little shoddy and I'm not sure why but the way that the preternatural speed was conveyed was a little funny looking. Overall the movie deserves recognition for all the hard work put into it by everyone. I don't think it's fair to judge it so poorly especially because of the fact that it wasn't what you expected.",Queen of the Damned

I feel that Interview with the Vampire was a good movie and and very true to the book.  However, Queen of the Damned was kind of like the book, but left out waaay too much. So much that i doubt i would have understood the movie if i had not read the book first.  The biggest mistake was trying to take two really good books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen Of the Damned) and trying to squeeze then into 100 minutes of screentime.  Thats shorter than Interview.  Of course there are somethings that can be left out, but you can't leave out the plot! Besides my complaints with adaptations the film wasnt sooo bad.  The acting was mediocre.  Special effects and sound were ok.  The music was decent. Editing was average.  But what good is a movie if theres no story?",Queen of the Damned

(And there WILL be rants.)This film wasn't just a brutalization of Anne Rice's novel, it was an all out massacre.  Did the writers even really read the book?  Ordinarily, I like to give a little leeway to screenwriters trying to convert a novel into a film, but in this case, far too many liberties were taken--combine that with the ridiculous characterizations of these vampires (all shallow glammers), and you have a total waste of $8.It seems they never figured out that Anne Rice's novels aren't really about vampires--they are really about human beings.",Queen of the Damned

After the first twenty minutes, i realized that i had to see this movie as a stand-alone and not compare it with Interview with the Vampire. I was kept attached to the TV screen almost the entire way, except i started to fidget in my seat towards the end. My mate and i talked through it and we agreed that the movie would have been a whole lot better if the actors were different. Steve made a great Lestat, as he has the vampire look about him, however we came to the decision that Criss Angel would have made the movie complete hands down.All-in-all, i was overly satisfied and the soundtrack put a smile on my face",Queen of the Damned

If you liked the book, spare yourself and let your imagination play the movie for you - you will enjoy it so much more.But if you want to watch a slick movie that needs very little attention and you like a good perve and a few special fx, by all means go along and watch - but when you get the chance, read the book and see what you missed out on.Personal note for Anne Rice.You wrote such a fantastic, intriguing book.

Anne rices books are some of the most amazing things I've ever read, and i recommend them. but the fact that the movie doesn't walk closely doesn't mean the movie isn't amazing as well. if it wasn't, do you think Anne would have put her name on it?

He sings way different from the songs. But the way that the movie is built on is great, the persons in the movie has very good character and how they ""saved"" the movie when Aaliah died in a harmful car accident, by faking her with some computer effects is just unbelievable.I would say that this movie isn't for everyone, specially not those who can't stand blood, supernatural things, vampires, a.s.o.

The movie is certainly not perfect, and it presents some information differently from the books, but, despite this, I enjoyed this adaptation much better than ""Interview with a Vampire.

365,Faking_Beauty,A Very Bad Movie,1,11 June 2002,"I went to see this movie opening night because for years I have been a big fan of the vampire chronicles.  I was expecting something along the lines of what they had done with the first movie, however, that was not the case. In fact, it seems to me, with this movie they did everything they could to distance themselves from the first.  The script for this movie was nothing but trash.  Some of the lines were so cheesy I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The acting wasn't the best it could have been and a lot of the scenes were so awkward that I laughed at loud.  It didn't flow very well, and I'm not sure that someone who hadn't read the books would be able to identify the characters or have any idea of what was happening.  Though, I went with a good friend of mine who is also a big fan of the books, and even he had trouble trying to figure out who was supposed to be who because the characters we so drastically different from what they were supposed to look like.  They kept introducing new characters (which most they didn't even bother to name) before they had even developed the existing characters. They moved so fast that you weren't even really sure who you were supposed to side with.  I would advise hard core Anne Rice fans to stay away from the movie because it will only upset you.  Anyone who was going to see it because it was a ""sequel"" to ""Interview With the Vampire"" should avoid it because it was nothing like the first one.  Anyone going to see it because it's a new vampire movie shouldn't waste their time because it was more cheesy then the sequel to ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" I really wouldn't advise anyone to see this movie at all.  There is no need to waste your money on nonsense like this.

367,okiram,Bela Lugosi is dead.... *SPOILERS*,1,1 November 2002,"Too bad the accent has survived. Ugh... two hours of ""I vant to suck your blood"" did not heighten either my fear, or my opinion of this film. But it's not only the cheap special effects and the questionable acting that taints this film for me - it's the terrible incongruncies that spoilt what could have been a reasonable film.""Queen of the Damned"" is loosely - very much so - based on the two sequels to Anne Rice's novel ""Interview With the Vampire"": ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned"". The difference between the two films is immeasurable. Neil Jordan's taut and spine-tingling story of 'the damned' suited Rice's prose; the characters of Louis, Lestat and Claudia were made not only fearful, but sympathetic. And, no, I am not about to bash Stuart Townsend when compared to Tom Cruise - he had the ability to make it work as Lestat. I'm blaming ""Queen of the Damned"" on someone not letting Anne Rice script the film (something which made ""Interview"" so great).So, obviously, Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni chose a different path. Good for them. But it doesn't make for a good film. After reading the book I was surprised at all the strange decisions they made: such as the scene in which Akasha(Aaliyah) ate the still-beating heart... when you consider that Akasha, 6000 years earlier as Queen of Kemet(Egypt), killed cannibals mercilessly, even those who consumed the flesh of their relatives religiously, its rather an unusual choice to make. Marius as Lestat's maker COULD work: but it simply doesn't fit. This is the only fleeting reference to ""The Vampire Lestat""(the book, not Lestat's band); along with the Stradivarius violin - please, if Nicki could just rise out of his vampire grave! :(Performances were weak as could be. The finale was incredibly disappointing, with the absence not only of Mekare, Maharet's sister - but also LOUIS and GABRIELLE(the former of whom is never mentioned in the film, although obviously when viewing ""Interview"" he appears quite important to Lestat; the latter a character from ""Lestat"" and therefore has a reason to be excluded). And, if I remember correctly, wasn't KHAYMAN destroyed? Laughable.Apart from the fun side of things - giggling at the accents, the strange appearances of Australian television and film icons(heh... John Barton...), and the off-chance you might spot someone you actually KNOW(people from my hometown were in the 'Death Valley' scene) - ""Queen of the Damned"" makes for fairly ridiculous viewing.Anne Rice endorsed ""Interview"" with a full page advertisement. I doubt she'd give ""Queen of the Damned"" a one-liner.",Queen of the Damned
368,teen7365-1,This movie is one of the my favorite film,10,27 January 2007,"I watched the movie ""Interview with the vampire"" before I watch the ""Queen of the damned"". I though ""Interview with the vampire"" was great. and I still think like that. But ""queen of the damned"" is my favorite! Can you imaging that Tom Cruz is rock star? Umm...;-( ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; I think Stuart Townsend was perfectly fit the role of the vampire Lestat. Stuart was so sexy and gloomy....T^T Every scene of the 'Queen of the damned' was so wonderful. So fierce,gloomy,beautiful and sexy. I am totally fall in love with this movie. So I bought the set(include 4 book)of vampire chronicles in the Amazon. Even I am a Korean,and my poor English. 5days ago, The books was arrived. And now, I am reading 'the Vampire lestat'. Sooooo wonderful and awesome. Anyway, I recommend this awesome movie ""The vampire lestat"".",Queen of the Damned
369,hyperfrec01,Typical,5,10 July 2002,"For those of you out there who are fans of Anne Rice, you will be DEEPLY disapointed with this movie. Hollywood big shots have absolutely trashed it. It doesn't follow the wicked, tempting, spectacular tale that we all loved in the chronicles. Lestat has black hair(small, yet noticable difference) The most DISGUSTING change was that lestat was created by MARIUS. When i saw that, my jaw dropped open, and I must admit that my friend had to scoop my chin up off the floor. Even after that Marius doesn't show the caves to Lestat, Lestat simply tumbles in. Not to mention Akasha simply raises her palm to let Lestat, as opposed to thrilling spectacle described in the book. Instead of Enkil turning to ""glass"" The statue has its neck slashed through, and is still made of clay. Lestat doesn't meet up with Louis or Gabrielle before the concert. I could go on and on and on into an oblivion.. which i must admit, i have already done.. but i'm going to stop now. Please Anne Rice fans, don't waste your time and money.HOWEVER, i'm sure that if i did not know of the book, or did not read the book, the movie would be rather thrilling. So those of you who don't care, feel free to waste time and money.Thank ya",Queen of the Damned
370,Janarrah69,Easily the best new movie of this year so far...and all that I expect from a modern vampire movie,9,24 February 2002,"For my money, QUEEN far outshines INTERVIEW as an enjoyable movie. The story made perfect sense to me, the characters were portrayed well and interesting to watch, and the effects added to the plot, rather than acting as an excuse for the plot. Alliyah would have been proud of her performance and I think Townsend made a much better Lestat than Cruise's overly-mannered performance. A good popcorn movie, well worth the price of admission....and who cares if it varies a bit from the book....different mediums often require story variations. I even think the soundtrack helped build the mood and style of the film. See it, you'll like it!",Queen of the Damned

372,Darth Athena,badly miscast and bad adaptation,3,26 February 2002,"Queen of the Damned....  Simply an effort on the part of the moviemakers to make money.  From the viewpoint of someone who has read and enjoyed the books, and knows the storyline, and Anne Rice's descriptions of the various characters, this was a truly bad movie.  Essentially, it was a strange melding of the two books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned), which neglected many of the elements that made the stories enjoyable and interesting in the first place.  In the case of Queen of the Damned, massive parts of the storyline were left out even though they were main portions of the plot of the book.  It was badly miscast, with most of the actors nothing like the descriptions of their characters in the books.  They even had the vampires' fangs on the wrong teeth!  The main thing that leaves me puzzled about this movie though, is how they could call it ""Queen of the Damned,"" when, in actuality, the storyline centered around the main plot of ""The Vampire Lestat.""Despite the many, many faults, it could be enjoyable, provided one had not been an avid fan of the books.  Stuart Townsend, despite his physical differences from Lestat, was excellent in his portrayal of the vampire. But other than that, I have nothing good to say about this movie, except that it would be fun to go see it again, just to yell at the screen whenever something strayed from the books.  Unfortunately, that would leave me quite hoarse.",Queen of the Damned

375,Adam595,Different,5,23 February 2002,"""Queen of the Damned"" has gotten a lot of damnation from critics, but I stand up to disagree. It simply took a completely different twist than its predecessor ""Interview with the Vampire,"" and is thought much less of as a result. I believe that they are too different to compare. I find it quite valuable to have Tom Cruise's take on Lestat, then Stuart Townsend's. They are very different, and they shine where the other's lack, and vice versa. Stuart Townsend is better at the modernized Lestat and Tom Cruise is slightly more archaic. As for Aaliyah, she made quite a presence for herself. She succeeded at being a real bad-ass with sex appeal. Who wouldn't want her to suck his/her blood? It was indeed a shame that this was her last movie, for she was convincing of her evil role despite her ""perfect popstar"" image.People in my opinion were afraid to appreciate a pop culture vampire story. Think about it, modern pop culture and a classic myth like vampires? I guess some mixes don't stand much of a chance in society these days...",Queen of the Damned
376,PreemPalver,"Is not based on the Anne Rice's novel, but it's entertaining",5,22 April 2002,"Definitively it is not based on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. The story becomes such twisted that you cannot recognise it. By several moments you think the only thing that remains from Rice novels are a few names of the characters.Apart from that, and that s few of the actors/actress in the film overact too much for my taste, the film it's well made. Nice camera movements, good special effects, FANTASTIC music (not only the rock songs but also the score), good photgraphy, well balanced sound, etc... A good job, pity they missed the story...If you want to see the Vampire Chronicles this is not your movie, but if you just like the vampires films no matter which they are, this is good fun...",Queen of the Damned
377,greywanderer9,Insult to the author,2,23 February 2002,"I can't believe a director would make a film that is such a glowing insult to the book it apparently derives from.  In what seems like a two-hour Calvin Klein Advertisement, Queen of the Damned changes just about everything it uses from the two Anne Rice novels it uses for its basis. With Wide ranging changes from character involvement, the WRONG creator of Lestat, to the wrong vampires defeating Akasha at the end, this film is more full of holes then a Troma films screenplay.  This movie was an insult to any fan of Anne Rice's novels and needs to be lead out to pasture before it encourages other mis-guided directors to do the same. With its plethora of changes, the above mentioned are only skimming the top, this movie is an abomination and should be left alone.",Queen of the Damned
378,bigpurrs,Stuart Townsend IS Lestat,8,23 February 2002,While not a perfect recreation of the books I did find that they did a great job with what they did bring to the screen.Stuart Townsend captured Lestat perfectly!

I actually was excited about the movie because the book was awesome, but then I saw the movie and It was just wrong. The graphics were okay, the people couldn't act, the plot was all off and the characters just weren't themselves.",Queen of the Damned
380,getshorty_019,"It's a MOVIE ADAPTION, people.",8,11 January 2008,"I loved this movie. Yes, I have read The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. The movie wasn't consistent to the book, but what do you expect? Is the Harry Potter franchise identical to its literary counterpart? Exactly. This film is not aimed to please Anne Rice fans: we have books for that. This movie is sending the TVL/QOTD story to a wider audience. Onto the comment: Queen of the Damned is about the Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has just risen from a century-long sleep, drawn to the power of ... heavy metal music. He finds a band, and sets himself up as a 'new god', a rock star. I can see parallels to real life already. The Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah, god bless her soul), is likewise drawn to heavy metal, and, as explained before in the film, Lestat has some history with her, drank her blood and got off on it, yadda yadda yadda. As a twist, Jesse(Marguerite Moreau), a young Talmasca, is drawn to Lestat for diversity. She reads his journal, is touched, falls in love with him, has some rather romanticized ideas about being vamped, and eventually gets turned by Lestat. Oh, and there is some b******t about the Ancients, but really, you don't pay to much attention to the storyline and end up just listening and watching Stuart Townsend. And little else.Biggest beef with the movie? Jesse. In the book, liked her. Played by Marguerite Moreau, she is boring as all get out, boring enough to speak in a near monotone. Also, Jesse and Lestat do not get all romantic. Sorry, folks. In my opinion, Stuart Townsend IS Lestat. He has the charm and sex appeal of the book Lestat, even without the correct physical features. Oh plus, he's a HOTTIE. Unlike Tom Cruise, who was plain creepy as Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. And Aaliyah. I wasn't an Aaliyah fan, and yet I find myself converted. While not really the Akasha in the book, and having a grand total of I think four scenes, she does her best with what she got. And considering she died, then some. The Ancients supporting cast, all good. Save Matthew Newton as Armand, and if you live in Australia, you know it's not his acting ability I'm talking about. He's creepy too. Lena Olin as Marharet is fantastic, although to old, and leaves me question who would play the phantom (filmwise) twin, Mekare. Marius, Vincent Perez. Oh, where to start. He was... confused. And factually incorrect. Not a great Marius. Fantastic soundtrack, alright special effects (the flying? Beg your pardon?), hot Stuart Townsend, above par costuming, boring Jesse, surprisingly good make up for a vampire movie, and no overcompensating nude scenes make for a good vamp film.So, unless you're a stickler-for-facts, whiny, anal Anne Rice fan, watch this film with an open mind, and you shall love it. Especially the concert scene, and not just for Stuart's see through shirt.",Queen of the Damned
381,MadamNY23,"The second best move Aaliyah has made, to bad it had to end!",10,12 February 2002,"I saw ""The Queen of the damned"" at a sneak preview at my school. Being a big fan of Aaliyah, anything she does musically, and movie is DYNAMIC! So it was no BIG surprise that this movie was going 2 get a 10. It's better than all vampire movies, because the Queen Vampire is Sexy, And Beautiful, and VERY TALENTED! Aaliyah was the best, no IS the best and no matter how many years go by she will not be forgotten! And on top of that she gets 2 work with a hott Co-Star! So on a scale of 1-10 this movie gets a 100% ONE AND A MILLION!",Queen of the Damned
382,NormanBatesLover,What I thought of Queen of the Damned...,3,4 March 2002,"When I saw the movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to think. The special effects weren't too good, Aaliyah was barely in it, and the singing voice of Lestat (which was Jon Davis of KoRn) didn't fit Stuart Townsend. I would have liked to have seen Tom Cruise return in the role of Lestat, but I guess I can see why he didn't. But I guess it would be a little weird to see Tom Cruise play a rock star...I think that Queen of the Damned was a movie that would have been better unmade.",Queen of the Damned
383,LittleMissScareAll,"Damned, Forsaken, and Irredeemable...",6,26 February 2002,"So it's not all that bad...If you have never read the books. Being a long-time Anne Rice fan, I found it hard to sit through this movie without laughing into my hand and the absurdity of many of the situations.  My friends were constantly smacking me in the shoulder and telling me to shut up.The story the writers came up with was quite good, but nothing like the original story.  For instance, we don't have Lestat...we've got a Louis/Lestat combination.  And what is Marius doing telling Lestat ""you must be dead to the world"" when he himself was an artist and art dealer, the majority of his interactions with THE LIVING??? Did they just not read the books? Where's Mekare?  Um, last time I checked, she was the one that did away with Akasha, not Maharet... Lestat's just a little too straight for my taste in these movies...I mean, everyone knows that Lestat prefers the company of men, not Jessie...how else would you explain Marius, Armand, Nicki, Louis and David? and what's all this about Armand looking like a Def Leppard reject? Come on, people!!! This is nuts!But Stuart Townsend makes a good Rock Star Lestat.  The story, like I said, was good. I didn't think it was as bad as I had originally planned on...though I did have a few good laughs.And the music was good.  I personally think Jonathan Davis did a great job creating music worthy of our Brat Prince, though it's a bit depressing that he doesn't sing on the soundtrack.I also liked the makeup. The post-drink blood was a little...um...FAKE! but that's beside the point.  The overly-white, reflective skin on Lestat was pretty good.The special effects were too much like The Matrix.There's my two cents...sorry if I make anyone mad here, but it could have been done much better...",Queen of the Damned
384,shiri-1,Take A Bite...,10,19 February 2002,"The movie focuses on Lestat (Stuart Townsend) a vampire lured into the whole new rock scene. So tired of hiding underneath the shadows, he was quickly engulfed with his new discovery he joins the goth band Satan's Night Out and before we know it in a flash--- he has the music industry and legions of fans attention. Part of his mystery is he kept people guessing if he was a ""real vampire"" about to ""catch his breakfast"". Enter Jesse(Marguerite Moreau ) a Talamasca member, her job is to research on all things out of ordinary, you guessed it right she gets to know about vampires! She stumbles across Lestat's old journal which gave us a background about his 'life' or whatever you want to call an undead's life. Instantly Jesse has this little school girl obsession towards him. They meet, have a connection.Meanwhile,we come to learn about Lestat's fascination of the ""Those Who Must be Kept"" the very first vampires and that is Akasha(Aaliyah) and Enkil who are hidden in Marius'(Vincet Perez)chamber as statues sleeping. We later learn Lestat drank from the Queen the night he played his violin for her. Marius his teacher and maker warns him about the danger of the Queen. Back to modern day,Lestat has a Death Valley Concert and Oh no! Akasha has awakened! Lestat joins her and gets to do the ""vampire nasty"". Now this beautiful evil lures Lestat to become her lover and partner in her wrath to destroy. Will Lestat turn his back on her now?The film is not something to be taken seriously, I don't think that was the intention. It's a fun vampire rock movie, no more,no less. It's flashy, fast paced,funny,vibrant and violent, at times scary. It completely butchered the book. First of all,Queen Of The Damned and Vampire Lestat combination already sounded awry, it's completely hard to adapt that part of the chronicles. The vampire history was completely scrapped in the movie, which disappointed me.  I do see why though, it will turn out to be so long-winded and that's like a whole movie by itself. Lestat is basically the focal point here and the filmmakers basically had a new spin on his story. I believe if they did take themselves seriously as a page by page adaptation for a film, I don't think it might work quite as well.The acting was decent, my favorite would be Vincent Perez's Marius though odd looking as a short haired, pale and thin lips, he surprisingly caught the essence of the character. Lena Olin was a great Maharet what the hell she's great in everything. Stuart Townsend though he got the evil, mischievous, sexy and androgynous side of Lestat, he's no Tom Cruise.  I literally squirm at the sound of his horrible accent, he would've been good but that accent really irks me. He should've been mute all through out,aaah! The nightmares I will have. Marguerite Moreau (Jesse) suffers with such a boring and lousy chracter with hardly any depth, at times how I wanted Akasha to drink her all up or do that heart stunt to her. Poor girl, she did what she could do, I can't blame her she can only do so much to a bland character. I must disagree though about the comment given about Aaliyah's acting, coming from someone who was never a fan and am never familiar with her work both as a singer and an actress, I thought she played Akasha very well indeed. Sensual,arrogant and totally intimidating and screwed up as hell. Sure, she's a mediocre villain but that bar scene made me want to clap as she walks over the fires with this serpentine movements,so alluring. As a sophomore film effort, she was great.About the soundtrack Jon Davis and Richard Gibbs did an amazing job integating the nu-metal influence in this vampire flick, although I thought it was a bit overdone, I would have wanted more of the violin score from time to time. Maybe because I'm not a big fan of hardcore metal/rap music anyway.Overall, take a bite it's an entertaining ride. You're right this is no 'Interview'...I don't think it wants to be.",Queen of the Damned
385,electricdischarge,"I was expecting a dud, but I really dug it!",7,22 February 2002,"I had read several reviews on this film, all of them trashing it, but I loved Anne Rice, so I gave it a shot. Right away I knew I should have NOT doubted this movie. Of course it's not amazing..but I did enjoy it, and I would go see it again..right now if I wasn't sitting here at home writing this. Stuart Townsend is excellent as Lestat. Not exactly as the book, but of course what movie is. No Louis..flashy ""Matrix-ish"" cgi, but MUCH better than alot the more recent Vampire movies that have been out in the past couple of years.",Queen of the Damned
386,Clown005,What was everybody expecting,10,22 February 2002,"First of all people, a book is not a movie. In a book Anne Rice's creativity is limitless and not limited to what you can do in ""real life"". Also Anne Rice did not really have direct interaction in the movies production so do not base you opinion on that! For people who say they are ""real fans"" and hate the movie, readers be warned they are not true fans. First of all this is not a ""sequel"" to ""Interview with a Vampire"" this is the third book in the series. Therefore the director had to give some kind of background (mostly made up but loosely based on the book ""The Vampire Lestat"") on Lestat and the other vampires present.The movie in directing and screen play was Excellent. The voices were great and for people who said there wasn't enough of the vampire queen in the movie... well Aaliyah died before the editing was done so forgive them for that!To end the movie in my opinion was an A+. Mainly because it wasn't based on the book. When I read the vampire Lestat and queen of the damned the way I pictured things in my head the way Anne Rice intertwined the language she used is in no way re creatable on screen. The movie was a great ""original"" ideaPlease go see it and do not be discouraged by these reviews.",Queen of the Damned
387,i3felicity,"Sorrow for all Anne Rice fans, and for Aaliyah",1,22 February 2002,"Obviously the writers and director of this movie couldn't have known it would be one of Aaliyah's last, but it is sad that her final effort had to be so poorly written. If you're a big Anne Rice fan, or even if you have only read this book, don't bother to see the movie, it will only make you angry.  I can't say too much without spoilers - so here's a quick one and I'll get off my soapbox.
Vampires in the sun??  I think not.And that wasn't even the worst of the changes.  I wanted to cry when I left the theatre, not because the movie was moving, but because they took a wonderful book and made a movie that was crap based on it.Remember Lost World and how different it was from the book?   Magnify that and you have Queen of the Damned.Absolutely horrible.",Queen of the Damned
388,YHWH,This is a very good movie.,10,22 February 2002,"Was it entertaining?  Yes, it was.  Was it believable?  No, but I did leave the lights on that night.  Was it predictable?  No, not really.  But, it is a very good movie.  A little scary with just a touch of humor, this movie proved to me that the good guys do not always have to win.  Conversely, the bad guys do not always have to win either.  This blood sucking spin on reality (Whatever that is?) seems to blur the concept of good versus evil by pitting 'popular' evil against a more 'meat eating' version of evil.  Or in todays parlance we have the non-vegetarian evil up against the pork eatin' type evil.  Okay, so in summary we have Anne Rice depicting a rather bad group of the living-dead as having some type of a soul or conscience or who knows what. So I give it a 9 out of 10.  And, I thought it a better movie than INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE which I gave a 7.",Queen of the Damned

This poor little movie is very campy in parts, to the point that instead of being scary, it's funny.Stuart Townsend is beautiful to look at, but his performance is a cross between Jim Morrison of the Doors and Beef from ""Phantom of the Paradise"". Instead of fearing him, you feel sorry for him -- NOT the way the Vampire LeStat should be portrayed.  I hate to say it, but Tom Cruise actually nailed the persona much better.Vincent Perez as Marius was also miscast.  He looks nothing, sounds nothing like the Marius of the books, who is a tall, blond philosopher.It's such a shame that Aaliyah will be remembered only for this role. Someone older would've been much better than this child.  She just didn't pull off the sophistication that should've been required for the part. She was very pretty, but had no depth.",Queen of the Damned

Also, Marius (the gaurdian of ""those who must be kept""), was credited as being the creator of Lestat. Right...Lestat was a friend of Marius, but was created by some psychotic vamp who committed suicide soon after he created Lestat.  Marius was the father of Armand (who was in the credits but never mentioned in the movie). I guess what I am trying to say is...it could have been much better (why, oh why didn't Anne do the screenplay for this one too) and if you've read the book...wait for the movie to come out on HBO.

The movie as a movie was awesome! I did see ""Interview With the Vampire"" and I actually prefer Stuart Townsend as Lestat rather than Tom Cruise. He brought much more charisma to the character than Cruise did and I enjoyed his on-screen presense more.Unfortunately, it is the late and great Aaliyah's last movie (unless they use her few filmed scenes in the Matrix 2), but she definately proved herself as an amazing actress in this film (and Romeo Must Die); better than all of the other singer-turned-actors. It's a shame she is only in about 20 minutes of total screen time (the ONLY disappointment with the movie)The movie was just awesome. It had amazing special effects that enhanced the great plotline BASED ON, but not exactly interpretted from, the book. Queen of the Damned is the best vampire/horror movie I've seen in a while. All this was tied in a nice length of time that wasn't long or drawn out. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD! See it no matter what!5/5",Queen of the Damned

The fight scenes were really neat.  Aliyah did a good job as the Queen of the Damned, even though the character itself was very one-dimensional.  I liked Stuart Townsend, too - he was really sexy as vampire-boy.  Yum!  Also I thought it was neat that Claudia Black (Aeryn Sun from Farscape) was in the movie as well.",Queen of the Damned

When it comes to vampire movies, no one gets it perfect.As for the acting, Aaliyah is way too hyped up with her role. Sure she's the movie's title character, but I really think they used all the footage they had of her in the movie to make the preview. Stuart Townsend successfully portrays the vampire Lestat with his brooding tendencies and pale skin. And yes, there are actually humans in this movie! Unseen in the previews is the character Jesse Reeves, who has a major role and gets my vote for the person whose identity I would want to replace had the movie been real life.Maybe I'm just a shmuck for vampires, or just movies in general, but I found it to be a moving thriller with a few unexpected, yet appreciated, twists.",Queen of the Damned

401,wellsd,Waste of time,2,26 February 2002,"Where do you begin when you talk about a movie this bad?  First of all if you are an Anne Rice fan avoid this movie at all costs.  They not only destroyed ""Queen of the Dammed"" but also many other of her novels through misinformation and poor casting.  Lestat is cast a brown haired dark eyed man.  This is hard to accept for a vain vampire who constantly brags about his blonde hair and blue eyes.  Many of the scenes in the movie never occur in the book and vice versa many of the scenes in the book never make it into the film.  The action of the film actually combines part of another Anne Rice novel ""The Vampire Lestat"".  The movie's only saving grace was an abundance of stunning visual effects,  however, a multimillion dollar effects budget can't save a film this bad. Anne Rice: I'm sorry your work was destroyed by Hollywood.",Queen of the Damned
402,Strahd13,Wait for bargain bin at rental store,1,27 February 2002,"I have read the books, and my wife did not.  We equally feel this was a waste of money.  It won't be a long trip to video and then you can pick it up once it hits the bargain rack, any effort to see it earlier would be wasted energy.  Like many have said Akasha is about 10 minutes of the 100 and the rest is like some 15 year old dork's (who plays Vampire RPG) idea of a story.  Anne Rice only supplied names for as much as they follow her writing.  Lots of money lead to some high cost scenes but that is hardly a movie.
If you are mostly numb above the neck level, and into the other braindead work out there, then by all means this is your movie.  Anyone who tests above Gump-level in IQ should save the time.",Queen of the Damned
403,QueenAleta,If you liked the book don't go see the movie,2,1 March 2002,This movie was awful! The only bright spot in it was the performance by Aaliyah. She was mesmerizing. Unfortunately the movie wasn't. Queen of the Damned has very little in common with the book. They changed Lestat's back story. Some of the major characters are missing and their main interest in creating this film seems to be to sell the sound track. This movie was so bad that for me it almost tied with Knights Tale & Evolution for being the worst film I've ever seen.,Queen of the Damned
404,jalgari,Movie To Be Damned,1,2 March 2002,"Horrible movie. Save your money. Did no justice to the book, to vampire lore, to movies in general...Saving graces to the movie (but still not enough to allow me to rate this movie higher than ""awful""): (a) Stuart Townsend -- when he did not speak. His physical portrayal of Lestat was dead on, but the way he said his lines just irritated me. Made me feel as if someone had seen one too many Bela Lugosi movies. Or perhaps he's seen Bram Stoker's Dracula one too many times; (b) the soundtrack. Music always makes a movie better. This was the best aspect of the movie; (c) Aaliyah as Akasha. She portrayed Akasha as you would want her portrayed -- vulnerable yet powerful, seductive yet coy, independent yet dependent (esp. dependent on Lestat's love, the love of her brood, etc. -- of course had they followed the book a little better this would have been more prevalent in the movie).My advice -- buy the soundtrack (even though Jonathan Davis does not appear on it) SKIP THE MOVIE.",Queen of the Damned
405,Emaleth_,The best movie I have ever seen!,10,3 March 2002,"This movie is the best I have ever seen!  Queen of the Damned was my favorite book from the Vampires' Chronicles.  I must say that Stuart Townsend was Lestat!  I loved everything about how he portrayed my favorite vampire.  He was soo much better than Tom Cruise.  Aaliyah was awesome too as Akasha.  I couldn't have think of a better person to play her.  Even though the movie isn't like the novel, I just loved it!  The love story between Jesse and Lestat was beautiful.  I would have like to see the Legend of the Twins and more of the Ancients!  But the Death Valley concert was awesome too!  The music!  The actors!  WoW!  Truly the best movie I have ever seen!",Queen of the Damned

410,thevampiress,"Wasn't expecting much at all, but was still violently let down",1,9 March 2002,"I did the opposite of what people usually recommend doing. I decided to read the book then watch the movie and try to spot the differences. I read the Vampire Lestat about a year ago and loved it and I was fully prepared to watch the movie by finishing Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned the day before I watched it.I found myself getting more and more furious as the show progressed. None of Anne Rice's characters were recognisable except that maybe they shared the same name. Lestat was obnoxious, cruel and totally unlikable in the movie, which seemed very surprising considering that millions of readers love him in the book. Marius was nothing like the wise, cultured and kind Vampire in the book(he wasn't even the one who made Lestat in the book) The makers of the film had such fun twisting the whole story upside down, I reckon. There are so many things I could say about how the movie does not do the books justice, but I would have to write an essay then. The story of the Legend of the twins was very essential to the story, but they left it out totally which leaves for so many questions.I read their official website where the producer explains why this was done, that they had no time to fit a lot of what the book is about into the movie, but I just don't buy it, Interview with the Vampire managed to do so, so why couldn't they. They should probably have cut down the long draggy shots in general, or not add additional cheesy scenes that did not exist in the book, THEN they could have got some content in. They just had to turn it into a stupid, cheesy, trashy Vampire flick, sigh. They shouldn't have called it the 'Queen of the Damned' if it wasn't really even safely based on the book, I bet Anne Rice had sleepless nights over this horrible movie.Okay, let's just put aside the books for a while and try to imagine that this movie wasn't based on one of the greatest Vampire characters and stories of all time.The effects were low budget, and the actors in general were bad not to mention the over excited and amateur actors in the backgrounds, obviously goths they pulled off the Melbourne streets. None of the exquisite detailing of Interview with the Vampire. The vampires in general were a scruffy bunch especially the group of Vampires that sucked Akasha dry at the end. And the ending was oh so convenient.And what's with the love story element anyway? I hate this movie and how it has taken away the chance for some other worthier director and production team to do Anne Rice's books justice",Queen of the Damned
411,ibrockie-1,"Visual junk-food, lots of eye-candy ... a good easy weekend film.",9,10 March 2002,"I enjoyed ""Queen of the Damned"" far more than the other Vampire Chronicle adaptation, ""Interview With The Vampire"" (I like Jordan's work generally). I think that many people, who like the books, got swept into them: into the fun historical milieu and eroticism.  Jordan's film took itself a little seriously and tried to draw that world in too much detail.  This movie knows that the immediate appeals of this novel are the classics of escapism: youthful sexuality, delusions of grandeur, and big effect violence. Viewers want all of these and want them serving some simple didactic theme.  In this case, even an egotistic cruel vampire, like Lestat, can have a shred of humanity and will make the choice to serve humanity's best interest (even though to him they are an amusement). The new faces in the cast were good. Aaliyah looks great, but her dialogue was a little flat, nonetheless she shows the same charismatic potential that River Phoenix and Tupac Shakur showed and her untimely death, like theirs, means that her talents will be forever represented as ripening.  I liked Stuart Townsend, his Lestat was sexier and more charismatic than that ""other fellow"" who played the part years back. I liked Marguerite Moreau and Vincent Perez but felt that more of their work may have ended up on the cutting room floor.  Not enough of Lena Olin! I wished that they had attended a little more to Louis and some of their backstory (a mention of Claudia and Armand might have been nice.) The presentation of the goths was interesting. I wonder how many of them will see this film and realize that most of them are more like the naieve or dorky characters who the vampires denigrate, than they are like vampires themselves.  Basically, where the novels ""Interview"" and ""Lestat"" were fun pseudo-history and pseudo-biography, ""Queen"" was a little soapy and glitzy. The movie is an eye-candy version of  a word-candy book ... not too nutritious but sensationally satisfying.",Queen of the Damned
412,ingakolla,This is about how I liked the movie! Super cool!,10,16 June 2002,Hi I just want to say how much I loved that movie The Queen of the damned. I have the cd right now and that is the only cd in my player ever since it came out.  The music is so good. I know it by heart.  And the movie! I went 7 times to see it in the movies and now I'm just waiting for it to come out on DVD. I've been waiting forever it seems. I have always had a thing for vampires and I think I have seen almost every single one there is about them. But the Queen of the damned is cool. Not like the others.  It is different. Cool. Sexy!

As one who has read the first five vampire chronilcles, I must admit some dissapointment. No with Aaliyah, who was wonderful as Akasha, or Stewart Townsden. But with whoever brought the book to the screen. Facts were wrong (Lestat's maker, for one) while some were altogether missing (the story of the twins). Where is Maharet's reason for wanting Akasha dead? Why a gudge to last 6000 years? What makes Akasha such a danger? Because she killed a few vampires who tried to attack her? Because she helped Lestat? These are questions the movie leaves you with. And Lestat? Where is his lust for the kill? Why turn him into Louis? Now, as much as it pulled from Anne Rice's novel, it was, unto itself, an entertaing movie. Townsden s amazing with the filmaker's version of Lestat and Aaliyah is grand as the doomed Akasha. Too much time explaing ""The Vampire Lestat"" and not enough explaining ""The Queen of the Damned."" But fr all its cons, its still worth Aalyiah's acting. It will see my movie shelf.",Queen of the Damned
414,Superbaum,Disappointed fan of Anne Rice's artistry,3,15 March 2002,"As an amateur writer what I witnessed as I watched this tragic misconception of Mrs. Rice's work was quite simply murder in the first degree, and quite brutal.  Mimicking is one of the highest forms of flattery, yes; but when you destroy the essence of that which you're trying to recreate you end up doing more harm than good.  What I saw was a man attempting to recreate a Monet (my own favorite artist) and ending up with something that resembled roughly a mangled corpse's viscera thrown at an old yellowed canvas.  I use a rather graphic example, I understand that, but it is only to appropriately present my concerns.  I think all the fans would have much rather enjoyed a movie 3 1/2 to 4 hours long giving us a whole and accurate story.  Even if the actors from the the ""prequel"" (IWTV) could not be hired to play their old positions, the least that could have been done was to match the style of makeup and mannerism that the vampires beheld.  It's an insult Mrs. Rice and to ""us"".. the ""outcasts""...",Queen of the Damned

My only real gripe (that I talk about here anyway) is with the writers.  So, with that said, I will now proceed with the bashing.**What happened?  The writers had an excellent book with which to work, and they killed it.  No wait, they raped it, mutilated it, and then burnt it, all while obviously in a drunken stupor.  How anyone who knows anything about the original _good_ story line can rate this above a 3, I just cannot understand.  Not only was the entire story line way off base from the books (since about half of the movie was from ""The Vampire Lestat""), and thus the entire series, but there were even parts that ruined the entire theories behind vampires themselves that Anne Rice put into all her books.  The defamation of the characters is one thing, the omission of extremely important characters is terrible also in itself, but undermining the entire vampire persona is simply inexcusable.   I truly feel sorry for all of Aaliyah's fans that had to see her for the final time in this terrible film. I don't mean to sound like some idiot who is just ranting, but after watching this film, I can't do anything else.  I would say more, but as you can see, I've said about all I can while staying as polite as possible.Please, if you know anything about the Vampire Chronicles (and not just the movie version of ""Interview with a Vampire""), do yourself a favor, and stay sane by refusing to watch this film.",Queen of the Damned

I read the books, I liked them, and was told that in order to generate the script for this movie, the writers had taken a copy of ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" and squeezed them together until all the good bits ran out into the gutter, and used what was left over to make this movie.I didn't realize that all of this had been horribly understated.  Most movie adaptations of books aren't true to the storyline, but this movie was atrocious, all on it's own.  Even if you discount the fact that there was a perfectly good story the could have told and ignored, this movie was terrible.

426,Nick Knight,Why God... Why??,1,11 May 2002,"I manage a movie theatre in a small town, and as such am privileged to screen the films before we release them.  When we received ""Queen"", I was so excited I just had to screen it (normally I don't screen the movies... afterall, who wants to spend more time at work than they have to?).  And though I saw it for free, I wanted my money back.  It was so bad, I would discourage my own customers from watching this filth.I love Anne Rice.  I've read nearly everything she has wrote.  I was even honored to meet the woman 6 years ago.  She is very talented, and Queen of the Damned was by far my favorite of the Chronicles.  Now, when the deal to make the movie FINALLY went through, Anne volunteered to write the screenplay... FOR FREE!  You'd think any studio would jump at the chance to have the creator of their film subject write the script at no charge. What did these pillars of genius do?  They turned her down!  THEY TURNED ANNE RICE DOWN!  And the film suffered for it.In no way is this a Vampire Chronicles movie.  In no way is this a good movie.  In no way is this even a mediocre movie.  The plot was hollow, as where the characters (who in no way resembled those from the books). Townsend is no Lestat.  Aaliyah was definitly NOT Akasha.  From what I saw, the only ones who liked this movie were those fans of the late singer. People would get up and cheer when she came on the screen.  But fans of Anne Rice would groan and complain.  That's who this movie should've been made for.  Instead it came off as an Aaliyah-vehicle.  And not a very good one, at that.In my opinion, this film should be destroyed, the DVD never released, and all memory of seeing it wiped from the public's conscience.

That was the notion I enternained until I saw Queen of the Damned.The idea of painting a picture of a ""modern day"" vampire is to me inspired genius and may recreate the way the world looks at this genre in the future. The backdrop of the gothic/heavy metal music industry brings an extra facet into this movie and in a way modernises the whole way I look at these blood guzzling brutes.A convincing performance by many of the cast members adds to the alure of the film and hopefully (although not being a huge fan of gothic music myself), will lead to this style of music coming to the fore in future soundtracks of this sort. I would encourage all moviegoers to give this one a watch, if not for the storyline then certainly for the moving and inspiring musical content, and the thought provoking backtones to this film.",Queen of the Damned
429,mango_addict,Sigh,1,5 September 2009,"I think Stuart Townsend was a GREAT vampire. He was however NOT a great Lestat. Other than the obvious appearance differences, Stuart made Lestat sexy, seductive and slinky. Lestat is charming, loud and in love with himself. I think Tom Cruise (and I'm not the biggest Cruise fan) did a way better job of Lestats character. If you have read the books then watching this film will be painful. If you pretend that the only thing in common are a few of the plot ideas and the names then I'm sure it's a half decent vamp flick. I've actually not seen a book so butchered before. At least this new Twilight movie got its characters correct.",Queen of the Damned

I liked the movie, if you let go of the damn book you'll probably enjoy it too.  I think Aaliyah was perfect for this role, and the music was very good.Overall I loved it.

The actor who played Lestat was very realistic, also the special effects were great. What I missed a bit is that the movie was not deep enough. In the book is explained how vampires arise and some characters are too superficial. But I can understand why the director has not explained all this, then he had to make a movie of 2,5 or maybe 3 hours. What I really  found great, is that the character of Lestat was really deepened. He's  a kind of devil and enjoys taking lives but at the same time he is very sensitive (the scene with the girl at the fire). He loves being a vampire but he also admires us for our mortality and our weaknesses. For me this movie is a big succes.",Queen of the Damned

I admit that I did find myself sitting there and watching the DVD and saying, ""that's not really what happened"" but I just told myself that it was hollywood.  At the beginning it says that the movie is based off of the Vampire Chronicles, not Queen of the Damned.  It is about more than just one book.  I thought Stuart Townsend was a great Lestat and Aaliyah was amazing. She's how I pictured Akasha.  Although I was upset that the ancients were not mentioned that much.  It wasn't until watching the deleted scenes that I realized Pandora and Armand were even in the movie!  I also love the music. Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs did a great job and I think they were really able to make Lestat fit in with the sounds of today.  Forsaken is my favorite song and I love David Draiman singing it on the soundtrack.

I have to say that the movie doesn't reveal as much as the book, but it still kicks butt.  The soundtrack to go along with the movie was absolutely mind-blowing;it's such a cool soundtrack.  I can listen to the entire CD without skipping one song.  That tells me it's kick-ass. I loved the movie because of obviously the vampires, but also it's so dark and dramatic and intense and erotic and romantic in a way.

I must rescue the performs of Marius and Lestat, (they did the best they could)keeping in mind the awful scripts. on the other hand i was totally disappointed with the performs of David Talbot, Akasha, and Jesse, Jesse and David felt kind of ""empty"" and Akasha is over acted. some important characters of the actual story were omitted as some of you have commented, but my biggest concern about the movie is that any of the characters show the true essence of the actual characters AT ALL! I think the movie is maybe acceptable for the ones who haven't read the book, but for the ones who have followed the vampire chronicles is highly disappointing.",Queen of the Damned

442,gothgirl1222,Very Great,10,13 October 2002,"""Queen of the Damned"" is one of the best vampire movies I had ever seen! The movie had suspense, action, and gore.  The combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the Queen and the rock mood of our star, very well acted by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create.  I'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if ""Queen of the Damned"" is worthy, I tell them it's worthy of buying.  This movie is most for sure a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!",Queen of the Damned

At first the only reason I wanted to see this movie was because I thought Akasha's (played by Aaliyah)costumes looked cool, but to my surprise, this movie was actually a love story-go figure! I was very impressed, especially with Stewart Townsend's performance(he played Lestat, a vampire), he was sexy, mysterious, dangerous, and he had some great lines. Yeah there were some gross parts, but the whole love story between Jesse (a mortal)and Lestat made up for the gross parts.I had to watch it twice to really understand everything that was going on, but it was well worth it!",Queen of the Damned
444,banderina_r,One of my favorite movies,10,8 August 2009,"I have to say this movie is absolutely amazing. I don't understand why it got such a low rating. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also Stuart Townsend did a great job of being Lestat, the acting was great. Also, normally I am not into that music, well sometimes. But I have to say in this movie the music fit it perfectly. If you like dark movies about vampires this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story to this.But,all I can say is one word: Amazing! My Rating is defiantly: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I seriously suggest you watch it. I remember not seeing this for years, I watched it again about a year ago and im addicted to it again. lol. Great movie!!!",Queen of the Damned
445,free_spirit18,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!",1,28 October 2009,"This is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times. I started to watch this right after Interview With the vampire and I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only did this movie's script have craters as big as the grand canyon, the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible-having a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the viewers intelligence. I'll give this one star because Aaliyah actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Other than that I would advice Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story.",Queen of the Damned

His longing to end his loneliness and his ""living in the light"" attitude along with his music, anger his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been slumbering for thousands of years.
This film is not for those looking for a true book-to-film adaptation. Those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in for a huge disappointment.  This film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the ""Interview With the Vampire"" film.There are a few plot holes and incongruencies, but as a whole, this film was satisfying.  Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a sensuality and sexiness lacking in the previous film.  The relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling.As a film, the story compels you and draws you in.  Casting is wonderful. Loved this story and film.  If you like simmering sensuality and sexual tension you'll love this film!",Queen of the Damned
447,westher,queen of the damned,10,29 October 2002,Queen of the damned is the best vampire movie of this decade with potential to be the best of the centry it has a more reality fealing then Blade and Dracula 2000. Stuart Townsend does a better portrait of Lestat then Tom Cruise did in Interwiew with a vampire. And it's Soundtrack is the best of all time thanks to Jonathan H.

Third are the totally terrible characters in general. I love great vampire movies like Dracula and Interview with the Vampire, but this is unbelievable, unremarkable, Hollywood at it's worst!If there is anything worth watching you must be a true Goth and a childish one, as this movie leaves you feeling embarrassed for it's makers, unless you have a naive way of sucking even bad drama and cult influences in your veins.If you absolutely must see all vampire movies, rent it.

451,jano-l,"Could have been MUCH MUCH better, if they had followed the books",3,27 November 2002,"First of all, this movie shouldn't have been called Queen of the Damned. Nor Vampire Lestat. People who have read the books will probably be disappointed. I was, and it even was painful to watch this movie. They mixed the books, and sliced them at will, removing important parts of the plot, removing really important characters, and changing others.Next few lines might be considered SPOILERS, so be warned:SPOILER WARNINGSPOILER WARNINGSPOILER WARNINGThey even removed the twins' story, and even one of them, changing their importance and the ending in the meantime. Other vampire characters are removed, like Louis, and the ones that do get shown can't even be recognized (Pandora, for instance, says two words in the whole movie, and I read in another post that Armand was in the movie, although I have no clue about who he was). The story about the Family was also removed, it was only mentioned near the ending. There are many other things that were changed, but I'll keep the list short.What's the point in making a movie about a book, if you're going to change most of it? Running time is not an excuse, it could have been a bit longer (it wasn't too long).",Queen of the Damned
452,mrchips_2003,Queen of the Calvin Kleinites (still queen of the damned),1,29 November 2002,"The movie is more about style (if you can call it that) than substance. It frequently has contemporary ""hip mtv"" soundtrack tunes blaring in the background while showing pretty boy Stuart Townsend prancing around half-naked as Lestat. I can guarantee you, if you liked Interview with the Vampire, you will HATE this movie. They are total opposites in every facet. Interview was a serious attempt while this movie is nothing more than an attempt to draw in the under 25 crowd. The movie has no redeeming artistic contributions. It's a glorified Calvin Klein ad, plain and simple. Avoid.",Queen of the Damned
453,aaronsrx,"Just seen the Movie, some thoughts",5,15 February 2009,"As an avid reader of the Vampire Chronicles, I was optimistic of another adaptation of the series. I enjoyed Interview with the Vampire, and was hoping for a film on the same level. However I was let down. The storyline of the movie was completely skewered from the novel, and failed to adequately touch up on the book's main themes. The acting wasn't the worst, as there were some good performances out there, particularly those by the actors portraying Marius and Lestat. However the failures of the film were the lack of character development and skimming of important details of the book which translated into a jumbled mess. For example there was no mention of the Legend of the Red Headed twins and no insight into the history of the Queen Akasha. If you are going to make a movie of the Queen of the Damned, then you better put her on the screen more and develop her history or her motives. While interweaving a whole novel's content into a 90 minute film is challenging, it's like the producers/directors didn't read the book but settled for the Cliff Notes version. In the end, the film is merely entertainment for those who have NOT read the book and pure folly for those who are avid readers of the Vampire Chronicles. I will see this movie only once but will read the book many, many times.",Queen of the Damned
454,variablepurgatorygrl-1,"For sensitive Anne Rice fans, it might be a pain to watch",7,8 March 2009,"Even though the story is not entirely consistent with the original, written by Anne Rice, small example is Lestat himself and the story of his ""rebirth"". However if you're not to bothered to by that, or to sensitive to such mistakes, it still has some strange appeal. It sort of draws you in, could be said there is some strange magic to it, or at least to the characters in the movie, especially that of Akasha. Aaliyah seems to have really lived into her character, which adds the plus points to the movie. The special effects are also pretty decent. If you're into vampires then you'll love it just for the sake of the ""vampiric"" romance the movie tries to portray.",Queen of the Damned

456,irenawest,Awful,1,21 October 2009,"Even if I had not read Anne Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" from the ""Vampire Chronicles,"" I probably would still have thought this movie was just awful.It was tasteless, plot-less, it made absolutely no sense at all. I sat for a while pondering the plot disassociated from the book, and the longer I thought of it, the worse it was. To associate it in any way with the prior Chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie, let alone the book. The bare few ideas taken from Rice's genius in ""The Vampire Chronicles"" were butchered and ridiculed.It is an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being Aaliyah's last film. Truly, it's an insult to Aaliyah fans as well.Possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics. Good as they may be, it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie. As a matter of fact, I signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film (7 years after the release, as it may be) to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment.",Queen of the Damned
457,hellomoto666,This is an amazing movie.,10,14 February 2010,"I remember disliking this movie the 1st time I saw it, but it has grown on me. I love the costumes and poses the actors make, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich, and it moves very quickly. Every time I watch it, there is something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough.Also, the Lestat in this movie IS different, it is not the same character. You can see that the character Armand has been given Lestat-like qualities because I'm assuming Anne wanted it in. But there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books, it's a fascinating by itself.",Queen of the Damned
458,Hareb,Disaster!!!,1,23 March 2003,"I must say that this movie shouldn't even been released. Trash in the words true meaning. I saw Interview with the vampire some years ago. I thought it was a great movie. Then I heard of the books written by Anne Rice. But it was not until I had seen Queen of the damned I really took interest in the whole ""vampire chronicle"" thing. I felt so confused after seeing Qotd. And even more after have read Anne Rices books. The story in Qotd doesn't seem to have anything incommon with the real story, that's very disturbing. Interview with the vampire held itself within the frames of the storyline of the book it was based on. Like Qotd mixes two books in the chronicle series, skipped parts for example who made Lestat a vampire etc. I looked trough some comments before writing my own. I can't believe why people have to defend Aliyas (spelling?) performance. OK she is dead, but hell!! Does her life's work become a splendid masterpiece because of that? Her acting in the movie sucks. So does everything else in the movie. Not even descent effects. Like the scene were she walks out of the burning nightclub. Damn good job, NOT!!I could go on about how awful movie this is. It should not have seen the day of light (haha).",Queen of the Damned

461,cddeloach,"Good movie, bad adaptation",7,29 November 2003,"I am a huge fan of Anne Rice, and particularly ""Queen of the Damned"" so I really looked forward to this movie. I left with mixed feelings about it. On one hand, the movie was a terrible adaptation of the book with more plot coming from ""The Vampire Lestat"" than ""Queen"" and most of those were distorted or completely changed. However, I really did like the movie. I LOVED Stuart Townsend as Lestat! I think he captured the ""brat prince"" so much better than Tom Cruise. Just the right mix of arrogance and vulnerability. Not so great was Aaliyah's Queen. Sorry, but I think she was WAY over the top and her accent was really annoying.I do wish that the ""twins"" story of the book had been covered. I thought it was the best thing about the book. Since there is no mention in the movie, it is hard to figure out the plot. It leaves too many holes.Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it was and I will probably buy it if only for Stuart Townsend's performance.",Queen of the Damned
462,technopup,Review and SPOILERS!,3,18 August 2003,"This movie worked and didn't work for me.First off, the movie was visually stunning. I liked the dark and brooding quality of the backdrops and the scenery. I thought that the locations and sets used for Lestat's various residences fit his character really well. The costumes were beautifully done and really modernized the story (remember the book was written about 15 years ago and fashion/media trends change quickly).I thought the acting was - for the most part - pretty good. The screenplay, on the other hand, was tragic.First off, I've seen arguments for and against movies following the plot of the books they've been adapted from. I'm one of the people who believes that the storyline in a movie should follow that of the book. Otherwise, why not just write a whole new story? That said, there are certainly times when cutting corners works and others when it doesnt.In my opinion, Queen of the Damned is one of those screenplays where the cutting of corners clearly doesn't work. It's an amalgam of one of the story archs connecting The VAmpire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, rather than just the story of QOTD in itself. That said, it appears the movie makers were assuming people had either read the books, or at least seen the first movie. However, the tone of this movie was so severely different from the first that it can't be said to be a true sequel.While Townsend played a passable Lestat in some ways, the other characters were atrocious. Aaliyah seemed to be directed to convey extreme age and power by walking slowly and talking in a vaguely eastern european accent. Transylvanian is what it sounded like to me... straight from the Lugosi school of vampiric arts. Cheesy, though I think Aaliyah still managed to carry off a decent portrayal of the ruthless egoist that was Akasha.The story was mangled beyond belief. Some of the central points of both books carried through, but the real beauty of Anne Rice's works are in the detail. Rice is a better story teller than she is a writer (in my opinion, of course), and so I read her books for the tapestry of settings, character traits and observations more than for her word choice or phrasing. Most of this was simply lost in QOTD.Talamasca? What's that? No explanation of how Jesse came to be involved that was clear to me (in the movie, of course). Why did Lestat rise? What happened to Luis? Remember, it wasn't just Lestat all the other vampires were after, it was Luis as well. Then again, this was QOTD, not TVL, in name at least.There was no way to fit the entire story of QOTD in one film without cutting in large pieces of The Vampire Lestat, so almost everything but the extremely central plot points were completely omitted. So, no depth, no exquisite tapestry.The whole Jesse/Lestat thing was just annoying. Jesse was a strong character in the books, and just a vampire groupie in the movie. ""Please, do it. I want you to."" Ick.What they did to the character of Marius was a horror. Again, the only way I can account for any screenwriter seeing this digression from Rice's story as excusable was that they were simply trying to bridge the gap between Interview and Queen with as little effort as possible.Why pull in a bunch of characters from the novel and give absolutely NO explanation as to their presence? I read a post where someone said that the extras on the DVD explained who the people were. Feh. When I saw the movie originally, I saw it in the theater. I sat there wondering who they were and when Mekare was going to arrive. It must have been a minimal nod to Anne Rice fans who the writers assumed would be in the theater trying to pick out the details. Sadly, they forgot the actual details. A cameo by a woman in a sari hardly qualifies as intelligent character development.We won't even mention one of the main themes of the book: the story of the twins. The movie certainly doesn't.All the complaining aside, if one tries to divorce the movie from Anne Rice's characters and stories, one is left with a passable view of vampires as seen by MTV. It's a 90 minute music video that is, in places, breathtakingly beautiful.If you want to see a movie with some really hot actors and actresses, you like a gothic edge to your music and favor the incredibly young and thin, you will probably like QOTD. If, on the other hand, you want to see the third book of The Vampire Chronicles brought to life, you'll have to wait for Anne Rice to write the screenplay herself, it seems.",Queen of the Damned
463,Chaotx,this movie was really bad,1,7 September 2003,I saw this movie before i ever started to read the Vampire Chronicles and i thought it was a bad movie. The story was to simple and well stupid to have it be the part of the movie that grabbed and held you. The characters (the ones that were actually introduced) were never explained enough for you to have more than a superficial interest or empathy toward them. On a side note i would like to ask who and why would anybody ever think that chest plate thing would look good on Aaliyah? Rather than being seductive and beautiful like the character was supposed to be akasha (Aaliyah) looked kind of odd and retarded. Not qualities one would usually associate with the supposed vampire queen. The special effects were both bad and good depending on the scene. Most any use of vampiric power looked more cheesy than supernatural. The one saving grace of the movie effects wise was the really well done CG of Akasha turning into ash and slowly blowing away. I wont even mention how horrible the movie is after you read the books. If the characters did not share names you would never think it was the same story or characters.,Queen of the Damned
464,imdb-2823,Awfull,1,2 October 2003,"This movie is really poor!

465,ElohimLore,"Unlike the ""first"" movie, this was much worse.",2,15 November 2003,"I was going to see this at the cinema, but decided against it. I tried to work myself to see it on video, but I again decided against it. Now I finally saw it on Cable TV, and still wondered why I bothered.Queen of the Damned, where do I start? I read the books nearly a decade ago, but I still remember quite a lot about the story. To make the novel into a two hour movie is a really BIG ask. To release it as this ""tragedy"", well.The origin of Lestat is completely wrong (as any Anne Rice fan will tell you.)The back story of Akasha and Maharet was completely neglected. How and why did they become what they become? I know, let's not tell the viewer and let them work it out!Stuart Townsend as Lestat was okay, but he could only play with what he got. The major vampires from the story were delegated to ""background"" characters - Armand, Pandora, Khayman and Mael. And just where the hell was Louis???Aaliyah was surprising as Akasha, although I still believe someone unknown should have played the role; much goes the some for all of the characters.Jesse however was not turned into a vampire by Lestat, but by her Aunt Maharet after having her neck broken at the concert during a crowd crush.And they completely forgot that Maharet had a twin - Miriam - but that should have been covered in the ""back story"".If they were to make a decent adaptation for this book as a movie, it would be close to four hours long, if not over. So I can see why they cut a majority of the story for a two hour movie.I just hope that some day, that Anne Rice's ""The Vampire Chronicles"" will be remade as it should be - a mini-series for each novel. Yes including The Vampire Lestat. But I can see that won't happen none to soon.It might have been better not to have made the books into movies at all. After all, Anne Rice's descriptive style made the reader imagine vividly what the characters were going through.Completely disappointed.",Queen of the Damned

It is a true mystical romance - I have seen it many times and never get tired of it.  It is pure fun, the way movies should be.  The characters are colorful, the soundtrack is awesome and the plot follows through.  I fell in love with Stuart Townsend as Lestat.  He flawlessly expresses Lestat's dark sensuality throughout the movie.  I feel absorbed by his darkly affectionate eyes, sympathetic of his windswept infatuation for Akasha and stirred by his veiled passion for Jesse.The ending is perfect, which is the main element of a movie that makes you want to see it again.

468,ez_dreamer,Seriously lacking and lacking in seriousness,1,18 December 2006,"I haven't read the books so I was watching this as a stand alone product. The main thing lacking here is the atmosphere and tone that made Interview with The Vampire ""work"". The acting here is, in a word, inelegant. These characters move and talk like drunken teenagers showing off while their buddy records a clip on his cellphone. Visual effects look amateurish in some scenes and too much too out of place too unnecessary in others. The dialogue (and its delivery) is uninteresting. Come on... these creatures are supposed to be hundred of years old, where is the whimsy? In the end I movie didn't sell me. It comes off as ""comical"" instead ""vampire""",Queen of the Damned
469,Eibzesii,Damned good fun,5,6 January 2005,"As a fan of the novels and the movie Interview with a Vampire, I spent a good half hour yelling at the screen before realizing the following:1. These are not Anne Rice's vampires. Every character is different, despite their names (The only one to nail a character was Vincent Perez, the highlight of the movie as Marius. Good job.) 2. The plot of the movie is not based on the books. It as if someone picked up a copy of The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, opened to random pages, made assumptions, got bored and stopped reading, then wrote a screenplay.3. The vampiric rules adhered to in the books are not followed in the movie. The vampires just do whatever is coolest. A certain vampire can't fly? Why not? And why not give him a trail?Once you have acknowledged all these things, you can watch the movie. Have fun. This is not heavy stuff like Interview with the Vampire. Watch Stuart Townsend dance around in a mesh shirt and tight pants, and applaud when his shirt disappears, or, if you like it better, watch Aaliyah gyrate in a scanty metal bra contraption. It's what these two do best. Embrace its plot holes and stupid dialog (which lends itself to random quoting), sing along to the entertaining rock songs. Try and figure out what each of the ancients are named. Pride yourself if you can provide any explanation for what happens at the end of the movie, because ""trimming to help the pace"" leaves the ending fairly incomprehensible, especially to those who have read the books.Be sure to watch the extra features, the gag reel for laughs and the deleted scenes if you want to know what happened in the movie. Also try the various documentaries, which are entertaining when they throw in weird special effects while people are speaking.Perfect for a loud, popcorn-filled Friday night with the friends!Prindora (Eibzesii)",Queen of the Damned
470,iluvtownsend,Loved it!,10,17 April 2004,"Although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. It's great campy fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat is most definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have. The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is Louis' story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat's. In any case, I highly recommend.",Queen of the Damned

All this was so well done by Stuart. I HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE MOVIES FROM HER BOOKS IN THE FUTURE.Sheila Kautmanps...I have loved vampire stories and movies since I was a small child, watching all the Bela Lugosi,Christopher Lee,Frank Langella ( really a sexy vampire ) and Gary Oldman, and less we forget Klaus Kinski as Nosferatu.",Queen of the Damned
472,Ferris_Atenea,"Not that good, but not that bad either (without considering the novel)",5,7 November 2006,"To say that the movie sucks because it doesn't follow the books, is to underestimate the fact that, when seen on screen, the lead characters just don't lead. They're not convincing enough, not half as impressive as they're supposed to be in the first place.I somehow think that it's not their fault, I mean, I believe no actor, good or bad, could ever nail the part of Lestat.He's too magnificent, too irresistible to be played by just anyone. So that makes the movie not credible at all.Perhaps they should have choose a rock star to play that role. Personally, I think that Ville Valo would have absolutely nailed it if he just dyed his hair blonde (although I'm not sure if he can actually act, but he would have fitted the part more than Tom Cruise or Stuart Townsend, or just any actor at all).And then, of course, following the real story on the books, working on the dialogs, letting the author get involved in the screenplay and focusing on the facts that go along on the movie more than just use them as an excuse to make some sort of erotic goth love story would have helped a lot.I give it 5 out of 10 just because, watching the movie without considering the fact that it's based on the books, it is somehow entertaining.",Queen of the Damned
473,Ali_B,EXCELLENT!!!,10,14 May 2004,"I thought the movie was excellent. Aaliyah (R.I.P) was the most sexiest vampire I have ever seen in any vampire movie. She did wonderful as well as her music and dancing. Stuart Townsend was also one of the sexiest vampires I've ever seen. He also did a wonderful job as well as being sexy in general. Marguerite Moreau, I would love to see her in more movies not just because she's attractive with that long hair but a good actress as well. Vincent Perez, I believe, really did a good job as in actually looking like a very sexy vampire from back in the day. The music was awesome. I think it fitted straight into the movie. All the artist were very good. As I say again, I thought the movie was excellent.",Queen of the Damned
474,arrnloki,7/10 : Story apart from the books,7,21 October 2012,"It's been said in many reviews before this one, It does not follow the books. The basic idea is there, but there's too much book to cram into a 2 hour movie. Not to mention that it tried fitting ""The Vampire Lestat"" in with an already massive book to cut up. Trying to have Marius as Lestats maker...*sigh* And changing a few of the physical appearances of the characters. Leaving out important sequences of the story. The book, Queen of the Damned had an excellent story to it, which like most movies based on books, destroy.So from that aspect, don't hope for anything too similar to the story you love.The movie, apart from the book, was pretty cool. The music was excellent as well as some great camera angles. The actors chosen did a fairly decent job. In all honesty, it's one of my favorite movies. And the only reason I rated a 7, is because I REALLY wish it had been like a 2-3 part series covering the book better. I think it could have done well. Like I said before the actors did well portraying the characters, and would have continued doing well, in a 2-3 part series.Sex: A really nice Bathtub scene. Drugs: None. Unless you count cigarettes. Profanity: Mild use of some 4 letter words. Violence: YES.Overall, I'd recommend this to vampire fans, these ones don't sparkle. I'd also recommend this to Anne Rice fans who can set aside the differences from the book, because this is a good movie on it's own. Give it a try :) Thank you for reading, I hope you all found this review helpful.",Queen of the Damned
475,arielchan,Brilliant Comedy or Bad Movie?,3,12 November 2004,"My friends and I enjoyed this movie immensely when it came out, but were almost tossed out of theatre. We'd read all the books, so to us the film was high comedy. Most of the other people in the audience were just Aliyah fans. (I remember hearing a guy behind us going ""Oh! They're <i>vampires</i>!"" lik they hadn't mentioned that in the trailer.)The saving grace of this movie: Stuart Townsend, who has his godawful moments, but is mostly quite good, and very pretty.I bought this DVD used for $6 and my friends and I put it on at parties. Since it has no real plot, we can talk through most of it without missing anything.",Queen of the Damned
476,fireprincess_070,Great Vampire Movie...I Loved It,10,14 July 2005,"I loved this movie. Not only is Aaliyah's performance as Akasha absolutely amazing, but Stuart Townsend is HOT as Lestat. Although they didn't follow the storyline of the book, they did the best they could considering the circumstances of Aaliyah's death would not allow further scenes with Akasha. Vampires are portrayed in this movie with a human sensitivity as seen in Lestat with the violin and his care for Jesse. Again I say that I loved this movie and watch it over and over again. The music is also amazing and I bought the soundtrack after I saw the movie. Vampire attuned songs and great melodies that accommodate the mood of the movie itself. All in all, I love vampires and I loved this movie about them.",Queen of the Damned
477,Elfy_Vampiress,An Entrancing Movie For An Enchanting Story,10,2 February 2006,"I just wanted to warn all that this may possibly contain spoilers to some amount for those of you who are a bit picky. This movie I find to be very interesting and entertaining. Yes, maybe it should be entitled ""Parts of THE VAMPIRE LESTAT mixed in with THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED"" but that wouldn't be very catchy now would it? It's true that the movie does contain scenes from both books, but that's not so bad. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT leaves you hanging a bit with the concert anyway.Though some things are a bit changed, all movies do that. I think that this movie stays fairly close to the book even though it does bring in some artistic changing rights. I've heard some people complain that there's too much 'sexual hinting' in the movie. However, I must ask how much of the book these people have read? Ever noticed that Lestat's a bit of a perv as well as several other characters? But yes, overall I would give this movie a ten. Nice effects, brilliant story line. And a very nice Lestat. ^_-",Queen of the Damned
478,KindredsDisdain,Potential to turn into an all time classic,10,8 September 2004,"Now first to the obvious, this film is inseparably linked to the tragic demise of Aaliyah, which is playing Akasha the Queen of the Damned.This has directed some attention to it.In case of The Crow, the film has gained its special status to its Fans due to the Death of Brandon Lee during the making ... and both films have more in common than that.. I love both and both touched me, though Queen of the Damned took some time to do so, it did not when I saw it in the cinema first. It did as I rerented it for some reason I am still not really sure of, maybe because I love everything that is connected to Vampires and if I do not find a movie to watch I like to return to watching one of those I already know... and this one I had not seen as often as the others, well - now I have it in my collection and it is one of the most stressed DVDs.To the plot: Vampire Lestat is not the usual kind of Vampire. Supposed to seek the night he yearns for being among the living, cannot understand why he as one of the powerful kind has to hide and be lonesome as seems to be his fate. So one day he lays down to take a time out of a hundred years and awakes in the London of the present. He sees it fit to finally do as he always pleased, he joins a punk band playing in the ruins of his old house (or rather makes them join him)and with the help of his Vampiric charisma then turns famous, groupies yearning to be bitten by him not really aware what that means... but that is not enough to him, he openly states to be Vampire, breaking the rules of his kind, telling of their secrets in his songs and challenging the other of his kind. Those are afraid of a world aware of them and seek out to kill him. Lestat is not alone though, there is an organisation dedicated to observe the Vampires and among those there is a female apprentice who slowly succumbs the aura of Lestat. And there is the ominous queen of the Vampires, Akasha, who once ruled the earth with terror, living a life in the open, who one day with her King went to a sleep over the millennia as they were simply bored with their life. Sensing in Lestat the same yearning to be out in the open she is awaking and looking for her new king after she killed her old mate asleep. Lestat finds himself between two women, the Vampire Queen that was born Vampire, has incredible powers and offers him his share of those on her side, seeming to offer all he always wanted and the feeble and soft woman, mortal and still fascinating him with her yearning of joining his kind or die in the effort.I think Aaliyah is presenting us with a very attractive and credible Queen of the Vampires. I also think her role in this film is overstated, in the title as well as in many comments. She is contributing to the plot exactly what is needed and not more. I join others in the statement that for her, this was an ungrateful last film. She will not be remembered because of it like Lee will be for the Crow, but not because this is a bad movie, only because her role simply is not the central one. The central person is Lestat and his way through time. So we learn about his making, his dissatisfaction with his Vampire fate, making him the murderer of those whose attention and worship or even only company he craves and then the sort of suicidal decision to challenge all of his kind with breaking unwritten rules and do as he feels compelled to. This almost suicidal tendency he has in common with Jesse, the girl that has been raised under ominous circumstances and does seek the Vampires for reasons she herself fails to understand, there they are alike.. they are driven, forced to act in a way that other warn them is beyond reason and would lead to their destruction.This movie is fascinating in many ways. First there is the music, a score full of singers of bands like Orgy, Excess, Marilyn Manson.. something you not really would expect with a Vampire Movie, but really working well in exchange with the classical tunes one would expect, going along with the plot of the film and being of importance, not only some background aspect as in most movies.Second we have those main characters that really are well composed. Aaliyah personates the totally inapproachable cruel ancient Egyptian goddess returning on earth to spread terror again in a way she could not have done better. Stuart Townsend is making Lestat a sinister and profound creature of the night, wrestling with what contradicting emotions he is exposed to without getting a whiner. His way to interpret Lestat is superior to Cruise's performance in the prequel ""Interview with a Vampire"".. for what reason ever. (IMHO this role here would have been asked too much of Cruise)Marguerite Moreau is making us almost feel Jesse's fascination, making us understand why she is the moth drawn into the fire and accept it as in its own twisted way logical.The plot is not as action packed as many would like and it is dwelling in its slow moments as well, it is a film you are drawn to on an emotional level and either it accomplishes that with you or it does not. What I love most though is its subtle humour and that not everything is stated obviously. Sometimes less is more, that has been proven to be true with this film again. It is a classical like or distaste case, I think. I for one love it.",Queen of the Damned
479,carol-128,"Lestat, I salute you!",9,3 January 2005,"As a big Lestat fan i was a little dissed at Tom ( Cruise) he just wasn't Lestat, but then came Stuart ( Townsend) who was sexy, smart and a great actor, he looked like Lestat and sounded like him.I was totally dissed at some of the characters, like Marius, good actor, but looked nothing like him, same goes for Pandora and Mael.Plus the story was totally different from the book, which was annoying, but the music was good and the lead was terrific, i really enjoyed it. Just hope they don't plan on another one.And if they do, please guys choose Stuart as Lestat, he rocks!And this time, keep the story, Anne Rice is an iternational best seller for a reason!",Queen of the Damned
480,stevo_fantinel,Bloody Brilliant!,10,8 July 2006,"I quite this Anne Rice book adaption. While most of the film is filmed here in Australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. Meanwhile Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) a orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez)who is an ancient vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire too. Jesse is given Lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned- Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there Akasha may come as well. Meanwhile Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. With Lestat tempted with royality and loving care by Akasha the ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) plot against them. Join Her Or Die?I thought the film was fantastic, it had great fight scenes, great music and great locations. Aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere, but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets.I gave this film 10/10 because it was a fantastic film and I urge you to see it!",Queen of the Damned
481,tromans36,Queen of the Damned,8,4 October 2010,"OK.. Queen of the Damned is a hard film to review. I have seen it countless times and to me i will never get bored of it. The storyline leaves a lot to be desired but, hey the music more than makes up for it! As soon as i watched this film i was straight on the internet ordering the soundtrack and its now one of my fave cd's. the music is ace.Anyone who is a fan of vampire flicks and rock/metal should defiantely check out this film because it has both to the max. and anyone not into those things and just want a good perv fest, Lestat is your guy. I don't know whether its down to Stuart Townsend rocking as Lestat or the killer soundtrack. But one thing i do know is I <3 this film!!",Queen of the Damned
482,scoutervix,Loved it...,10,30 October 2004,"I for one loved the movie. For one, I am not a fan of Anne Rice at all. I saw 'Interview' and was so not impressed with Tom Cruise playing a vampire. He was totally unbelievable to me. I thought Stuart Townsend did an excellent job in his role as Lestat, washing away the distaste I had for Cruise in that role.I know a lot of hardcore Rice fans detested the movie and that's their opinion and this is mine. I loved the movie, the music was great and the cast was excellent! (Props to Vincet Perez as well for playing Marius and of course....to the late, great Aaliyah for her portrayal of the Queen.) My only complaint of the movie was that it should have been titled something other than 'Queen of the Damned' due to the fact that she was not in it for a considerable amount of time.",Queen of the Damned
483,theshedevil6662001,Worst film ever,1,30 December 2004,"This movie is horrid. I could sum it up in a lovely gagging noise. Not only was the acting intolerable, but it was like they didn't even bother with reading the book. The book itself was never structurally made to be brought to the screen. The concept of a vampire rising from his 'sleep' to join a rock band, simply works better in writing then in moving pictures. Even if Tom Cruise himself hadn't passed over the role, it still would not even have risen near ""acceptable"". Tom Cruise was Lestat without a doubt. Townsend pretty much destroyed the character! He raped Lestat of his personality, his cunning, his wit, and every other trait we've come to adore him for. Townsend turned Lestat into nothing more than a jerk with an ego problem and a lust for groupie blood. Other characters were also maimed in the making of this film. Marius's portrayal especially made me cringe. In the books, Marius is a LONG BLONDE haired, BLUE eyed roman man. NOT, and I repeat NOT a short dark haired, brown eyed Spanish man!! I love Vincent Perez, he did wonderfully in ""The City of Angels""...but failed miserably in ""Queen of the Damned"". Now another blaring moment, is that fact that a good share of main characters are MISSING. Louis and Armand do not make a reappearance. Gabrielle is gone. Maharet's sister is missing. Or in some cases characters were diminished. I believe I saw Mael at some point, but he was never given a name. Same with Pandora. I only knew she was in the movie because the credits told me so. Well there is so much more I could detail, but there is a word limit. Strictly speaking ""Queen of the Damned"" fell so far behind its predecessor that I don't blame Stuart Townsend for basically disappearing off the face of the earth. ""Interview with the Vampire"" is still the best, and probably always will be. If you have questions, read the book. You'll hate the movie too after that.",Queen of the Damned
484,ElijahBaley,Utter tosh,2,8 January 2005,"This movie fails first and foremost as an adaptation of Anne Rice's novel. A secondary failure is certainly that it fails as a standalone movie due to a dull, abbreviated script, laughable dialogue, poor casting and all-round abysmal acting. It neither brings across the general appeal of vampires nor the specific intricacies of Anne Rice's vampire lore. If it had been a good movie in it's own right I wouldn't say anything, but the makers of this movie fill in the gaps they tore in the original material with convoluted MTV trash. Just read the books and forget about the film, you won't be missing a thing.P.S. The song ""sickness"" by disturbed is great, the only spark of brilliance in this pile of refuse.",Queen of the Damned

The story ,written by Anne rice, is truly brilliant in its new and interesting take on the vampire genre. This is one of those films which every goth who has ever seen it loves it because of the Gothic darkness of the story and characters. i love the dark humour that runs though out the film and the brilliant music that sets the mood and makes that rock goth feeling complete.queen of the damed out does its predecessor interview with a vampire in every way and really brings the world created in Anne rice's books come to life.

487,tarr89,it was only off a bit,7,29 January 2005,"In general, I thought the movie was great (being a vampire/fantasy/romance lover myself). Although, I'm also a big Anne Rice fan, and I noticed that the storyline in the movie did not match up hardly AT ALL with the storyline of the novel. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler (it doesn't seem like it), but Lestat was NOT made by Marius, he was made by MAGNUS. Magnus threw himself into a fire, and Lestat went from there to teach himself most everything he knew. And, here's what may be a spoiler towards the end of the movie -- but Jesse was NOT drained and turned by Lestat, but I believe by her aunt, Maharet. And this was only done due to acquired injuries at one of Lestat's concerts, which was also never mentioned in the movie. The rest seemed okay, but those were two huge factors that greatly bothered me. Other than that, it just seemed like the movie script left out fantastic parts of the novel that I would've loved to have seen acted out in the movie.~K~",Queen of the Damned
488,tsubasa_ute,Saw once and refuse to see it again,1,5 May 2005,"This is a horrible movie, especially for those who've read the novels the movie is adapted from (The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned). One: I can't believe the disregarded Anne Rice writing the screenplay, the morons, they were her books for pete's sake, vultures! Two: MARIUS!! Look what they did to him. Someone wrote that the actor nailed Marius, I think not!!! Marius is described as a blue eyed blond hair roman, that guy did not strike me as Roman! Plus Lestat first met Marius in Egypt, with his mother in tow. Marius made Armand not Lestat... Three: Lestat was made into a vampire by Magnus, who was searching for a blond haired blue eyed man. Also Lestat learned from Marius to seek out the evil doer, so that scene with the two girls and having his manager get them for him....CHIGAU DAI YO!!!!! (wrong) One in the book, I believe the manager was female and two He hunts on his own. Four: Jesse was made by Maraharet and Maraharet didn't become the next Queen of the Damned that was her twin, Mekare. Also the others didn't drink from Akasha. (Mekare ate the heart and brain of Akasha, taking in the spirit of Amel, who was a spirit of sorts who liked the taste of blood and knew Maraharet and Mekare first because they were witches). Five: David Talbot was in his sixties, seventies damn it all!!!(though he became a vampire in book four...in another body)I saw this movie once and I swear to never see it again. It was absolutely horrible and didn't do justice at all to the books it came from. Interview, was wonderful but this was just crap!!!! Hell they made the Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings movies quite close to the books why couldn't they do it with this one!!!!",Queen of the Damned
489,alimagmel,"Great soundtrack, HORRIBLE movie.",1,6 February 2005,"The soundtrack for this movie, made by Korn's Jonathan Davis, is fantastic! But that's all that's good about this film. From a purely film point of view there are a bunch of under-developed characters, plot holes, and it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's not really surprising, since the director (Michael Rymer) has done nothing but 'B' movies, as have the two writers (Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni). I'm truly surprised that Anne Rice supposedly liked this film. If the screenplay had followed the book in any real way, the film would have been EPIC. No matter what the producers say on the official website, it could have been done right, as with The Vampire Lestat, if they had found the right writers and had actually wanted to work at it. But they were more interested in making a money maker, and so ended up with a movie on the threshold of 'B' movie, with a story that makes no sense, and actors that are only so-so. And some may say that the effects are cool, but I say they could have been a hell of a lot better. Especially given the fact that the film was made in 2002.Now here are my biggest pet peeves about the movie: 1. MAHARET IS A TWIN! In the book she has an identical twin sister, Mekare, and they can both see and speak to ghosts. This is a very important fact as to how Akasha is made into a vampire. The Story of the Twins in the book would have translated fantastically into the movie. They are also very important as to how Akasha is killed. Both of them kill her, not just Maharet. And Maharet does not turn into a statue afterwards. She just goes on living.2. AKASHA IS NOT African! Don't get me wrong, Aaliyah was very beautiful, was a good singer, and may have become a wonderful actress, but Anne Rice's Akasha was not African. Despite what the producers on the official site say is historical accuracy, it is not. Akasha was a princess from the historic city-state of Uruk, located in what is now Iraq. THIS is historical fact. Akasha would have looked Middle-eastern. Her husband, Enkil (who was sadly under-represented in the movie compared to the book), may have been African, since he himself was from Kemet (very ancient Egypt before it was known as Egypt). But Akasha was not. And I don't understand how in the movie Akasha and Maharet knew each other in the movie, since it is never explained. In the book, they meet in the ancient times, when they are both mortal, along with Maharet's twin sister, Mekare, Enkil, and Khayman, who was Enkil's steward. (Khayman was another destroyed character in the movie. He is also an important part to the creation of vampires.) 3. MARIUS DID NOT CREATE LESTAT! It was a vampire called Magnus, who kidnapped Lestat when he was a young man living in Paris. (This is in The Vampire Lestat.) Magnus then burns himself to death after creating Lestat, leaving Lestat on his own, with no idea what is going on. (Which is why Lestat says what he does in the movie version of Interview with the Vampire.) Marius does play an important role in Lestat's life, and IS the keeper of Akasha and Enkil, but he is not Lestat's maker.4. JESSE IS NOT A 'COOL, HIP' TWENTY-SOMETHING THAT IS MADE INTO A VAMPIRE BY LESTAT! Yes, she is made into a vampire, but by a vampire called Mael, who lives with Maharet. Yes, she is a member of the Talamasca, because she can see ghosts like Maharet, but she is in her thirties, not twenties. Also, she is a direct descendant of Maharet and Khayman through about thirty generations. Confused? Well, in the movie, Maharet mentions something about the Great Family. Some may have interpreted that to mean the whole human family. Not so. In the book, the Great Family are the descendants of a child that Maharet had right before becoming a vampire, whose father was Khayman. Maharet protects ALL of them, which is why Jesse ends up with her at times when she is a child. Another cool fact about Jesse from the book: She goes to New Orleans and sees the ghost of Claudia from Interview with the Vampire.5. AKASHA DOES NOT GO AROUND JUST KILLING ALL KINDS OF HUMANS. Yes, she does kill a lot of people, (and just about every vampire), but the humans she kills are MEN. And she doesn't kill them just for their blood. In the book, Akasha, while sitting on her throne like a statue, has come to believe that she is some type of goddess, and wants to rid the world of vampires (who can try to destroy her again as they tried to in the vampire wars of the ancient world), and of men, so that she can rule a peaceful society of women. She believes that all of the worlds problems will be solved that way. She takes Lestat to be her lover, and together they rid a couple of islands of all but a few men (for breeding purposes).I have a bunch more pet peeves, but I'm running out of room. All in all, if you like the movie, fine. But do not assume that the movie is based on the book in anyway other than title, and the characters names. The actual book by Anne Rice is sooooo much better, and I highly recommend anyone who has seen the movie to read the book. With the book you will NOT be disappointed. (And for those who may have tried to read Interview with the Vampire after seeing the movie, and found it tedious, all the other Vampire Chronicles are a lot more entertaining. They don't read like Interview with the Vampire. Give them a try!)",Queen of the Damned
490,sparklesthehamster,Gay!,7,12 February 2005,"This movie was pretty good, but, the characters didn't match the descriptions, and neither did the settings. Akasha and Enkil are portrayed as pale. I am reading The Vampire Lestat at the moment because the Queen of the Damned book seemed too far into the story for me to understand the full meanings of what is going on. But every thing is different from the movie and I feel that the name of the movie does not suit the movie. It only suited half of the movie. Because for the most part, it is of The Vampire Lestat. The tub scenes are really hot, but I don't know if they are really of importance to the story. I guess, all in all, it was a hella tight movie and I love the music.",Queen of the Damned

The fact that this movie butchered the books wouldn't matter to me if it were a meaningful, interesting to watch movie that could stand by itself (not that something like that happens very often). This one didn't work that way.To put it simply, the movie is mind numbingly boring. The plot inspires no thought beyond the possible ""the guy is hot""/""the music is great"" reaction. Since I don't care whether the guy is hot, and I don't find the music at all original or interesting, I can only wish this were a music video instead of a movie.

But it doesn't make much of a plot.My first major problem is the music. I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote ""The Vampire Lestat"", the Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though I could be wrong). I know relating to current ""goth"" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.Second, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. ""Lestat"" could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. I honestly don't think ""Queen of the Damned"" lends itself to a movie very well. Though I would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, ""inaction"" in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. And the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. Now mind you, it's been a long time since I've read it, I always thought ""Lestat"", ""Tale of the Body Thief"" and ""Memnoch the Devil"" were much more action packed and would have made better movies.I know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture.

The camera positions/movements are quite professional ; I don't see the acting itself to be very bad, all of the actors have charm and they hide efficiently the understandable discomfort during some somewhat complicated performances. I find the special effects to be good for the time of the release of the movie.At first, I expected to be watching a random supernatural movie, with goofs, etc... but I hardly found any. Music is great, color is great, camera-action is great and, of course, the story is very well told ; we don't get lost and every scene is logically linked to another at a time during the movie, which means everything has an explanation. And what not might be properly explained is what IS supposed to be left to one's imagination.I encourage every one who has , at least once in their lifetime, thought of Darkness in general, to take the time to watch this movie : you might get sucked into deeper, meaningful thoughts of yourself and whatever scares you.",Queen of the Damned
494,shellybellybaby2008,it was so great,10,23 February 2005,oh my god i loved this movie my best friend and i watched this movie over and over again because we loved it so much!! we know all the words!!we have the songs from it on CDs!! i know what you mean about the song system i love it it is my favorite song besides slept for so long.Stuart Townsend is so hot and i have always been curious about vampires and i love vampire movies and it is definitely better than interview with a vampire because Stuart plays a better Lestat than tom cruise any day.Gosh what else is there to say except for this movie is the best! i am in a really bad mood right now and i am mad at my mom and my neighbor and i am gonna kill someone!!! is that enough lines for you???Jesus... i hate it when my family does this it is really making me really mad!!! well i like this movie!!,Queen of the Damned
495,fairyfeet86,Fatal script errors,8,4 March 2005,"If anyone hasn't read any of the Vampire Chronicles this film seems fine enough but if you have then you will notice that half of the film is wrong! Lestat wasn't made my Marius, he was made by a vampire called Magnus who then went into the fire! Seriously its as if the writers just glanced through the book, saw Marius's name mentioned and made up their own minds. This annoys me very much when people don't follow details in the book! Having said that, i enjoyed the film a great deal (though i had to ignore all the huge mistakes). The soundtrack is awesome and really adds to the overall feeling of the film. It has to be said that Stuart Townsend doesn't look anything like the Lestat described by Anne Rice but he does however pull it off very well. I think a performance by Tom Cruise would have not had the same effect. He's more of an 'old school' vampire whilst Townsend suits the rock and roll vampire very well.",Queen of the Damned
496,snonbi,I like it,10,7 November 2005,"Maybe it is a low quality movie, but I like it!Maybe it doesn't follow the Anne Rice book, but I like it!I feel that one misses out on a great thing by NOT watching this movie (if you like Vampires that is) another thing is the soundtrack/score to it. Its wonderful! The violin-score on the beach for example is just absolutely magnificent! The artists on the score did a great job on this film, and so did Aaliyah (R.I.P) she was amazing as the Queen. Stuart is incredibly convincing at the role as Lestat. That was All !hope you can use this for something :)",Queen of the Damned

I figured by the reviews I'd read the movie would be cheesy... well, not in my opinion.As for the posed question, ""Who portrays a better Le Stat?"".... I think this goes to Stuart Townsend over Tom Cruise by far. If your skeptical to watch, don't be. You won't be disappointed.Prior to watching this movie, I did not know that Aaliyah had died. Saddened to read this as I think she had a very viable acting career.Having watched this on the USA network, I'm sure there were some very critical parts removed. I'm quite tempted to go out and purchase the DVD. This movie has seriously turned me into a vampire film fan. :)",Queen of the Damned
498,silkar_amurana,"If you read the books, avoid this movie.",2,24 March 2005,"I should have known when I heard Anne Rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing, and while I understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. I hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The acting of the Queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can't bring myself to laugh. The charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. The movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and ""dark"" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny Goths of America would lap it up. Part of the appeal of the first movie, of Louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness I read the books first, or I'd have never touched them after this movie.",Queen of the Damned
499,amy_de_lioncourt,Pretty good but could be better,6,3 April 2005,"Firstly i have to say i love this movie just because I'm a Lestat addict. Considering the film is only 97 minutes long i'd say they did quite well with the plot but it could have been soooo much better. My main suggestion for improvement is to stick more closely to the books because they are excellent. The description and dialogue in the books is so much more detailed than in the movie. in the movie its cut so much if you haven't read the books you barely know whats happening. in the film the character of Jesse has too big a part and too little a point, she actually has a point in the book. they should have either included more of Lestats history or made 2 separate films, The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned because there is simply too much story to be told in 97 minutes. Lestat should not be made by Marius and the legend of the twins should be included and most importantly Mekare, Maharets twin sister. the demise of Akasha was so much better when Mekare killed her and became the new queen of the damned. the merging of characters in this part was the worst mistake the film makers could make in my opinion. i really hope someone does this again in the near future but hopefully a new one would be more accurate. on a positive note Aaliyahs portrayal of Akasha was great because of her i don't care what you want approach to the other vampires. overall good viewing but don't take it too seriously or you will just get confused.",Queen of the Damned
500,sapnaprabhu,Nothing like the book,1,4 September 2005,"Sorry but this movie does not represent anything from the Anne Rice books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. After Interview with the Vampire (great except Antonio playing Armand), I had expected The Queen of the Damned to be amazing. Tom Cruise did a fantastic job of being Lestat, so much so that many of us could not imagine any other face on Lestat. Tom Cruise has that fun, smiling devilish presence, which like the character would appeal to everyone and make everyone forgive him. Brad Pitt was the perfect Louis and the Claudia actress did the best job of all. Just too bad about Antonio with his 35+ yr old face trying to play a 16 yr old. Someone like Antonio Sabato Jr would have made a perfect Armand. The actor who played Lestat, Stuart Townsend, did not do Lestat any justice at all. Lestat is a golden haired, sexy, laughing and smiling monster, not a brooding, dark and sombre person. Magnus made Lestat not Marius. Marius has long white blond hair, with a large friendly face, not short dark hair a thin mean face.Where was Gabrielle, Mekare, Khayman, Eric...????? Maharet was just as powerful as Akasha! Same as Khayman and Mekare. The dramatic ending was horrible and not realistic at all. After looking forward to the movie, I was extremely disappointed as were many Vamp. Chronicle fans.I hope someone remakes the VAMPIRE LESTAT and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED as 2 separate movies that are more related to the book.",Queen of the Damned

Now that thats out of the way, i am a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, i own everything she has ever written,so i might be a little bias, but, i love vampire lore in general but this film was not true to the book ""queen of the damned"" at all first off, lestat is 6' with blonde shoulder length hair, i feel that Stuart Townsend would have played him excellently if they would have gotten the make-up right, and trust me this isn't the only thing wrong with the story, well if anyone has read the books then they also know that lestat de lioncourt was not given the dark gift by Marius, but he was forced into it by magnus, all in all this movie has nothing in common with the book(S) it is trying to bring to life. the only things that are true to form are the names of the characters and certain scenes, like i said you will know what I'm talking about if you have read the books. all in all the effects were pretty good but as i have stated this movie is a huge let down to the AR fans out there.",Queen of the Damned
502,oluchi79,bit of a disappointment,6,17 April 2005,"The only reason I bought the movie was because the late Aaliyah was in it. I decided not to watch the movie because of the many critics I had heard about the movie. And I did not want to remember Aaliyah in that way. I have had the movie for over 2 years now. And yesterday I decided to watch it. Of course I was disappointed because the role of Aaliyah, Akasha did not seem to make much sense to me. She only appeared in the last part of the movie and did some flashy stuff there was no depth in the story. The movie seemed rushed. I guess this is because it was two books in one. Which I thought was a real pity. I have seen ""Interview with a vampire"" and I liked it because the movie seemed to have many complete stories in one. Also it worked my emotions. I especially can remember how angry i was at a certain point of that movie. This movie on the other hand seemed to lack any kind of storyline at all. There was no suspense in the movie. If the last scene had played directly after the first scene it would not have made any difference. Because for me the movie left so many questions unanswered.",Queen of the Damned

When you watch this movie, try not to view it as you would Interview with the Vampire. It's a completely different story. Try to watch and enjoy a film for once. It isn't one of the books. Books and movies are completely different mediums. This movie was created with the audience in mind and it successfully engaged most viewers.

Or you will be angry, unsatisfied, sad, and lost. It is a beautiful film as just a film but as a film adaptation of a book it is the spawn of crap and the cousin of vomit. But again it is a great movie for itself and by itself. The actors did well for the script and description They were given and I honestly hope that in the future they will attempt to redo the vampire chronicles in film media again.

505,mizabizou,What A Great Horror Movie!.,10,16 August 2015,"Queen of the Damned is a 2002 vampire horror film and a loose adaptation of the third novel of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles series, The Queen of the Damned, although the film contains many plot elements from the latter novel's predecessor, The Vampire Lestat. It stars Aaliyah as the vampire queen Akasha, and Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat. Queen of the Damned was released six months after Aaliyah's death and is dedicated to her memory.Vampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a heavy metal band which he proceeds to take over as the lead singer. Achieving international success and planning a massive live concert, Lestat is approached by Marius, and warned that the vampires of the world will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile.Jesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. He also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and is now in the Talamasca library. In a flashback to his origins, Lestat recalls how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Jesse tracks him down to a London vampire club where he saves and confronts her. She later goes to Los Angeles for the concert and gives him back his journal. The two spend some time together and Lestat shows her both the horrors and the perks of being a vampire. Showing him that she's not scared of him Jesse stays with Lestat as she sees how lonely and miserable he is. She asks him to turn her as she reveals that it's her dream to be a vampire, but he refuses as he won't do it to her. The more time they spend together, the closer they become and soon Lestat and Jesse start to fall in love. Meanwhile Akasha is awakened by Lestat's new music. She arrives and torches the club, and all the vampires inside, who want Lestat dead.At the concert in Death Valley, a mob of vampires attack Lestat and Marius. Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her as her new King. The two vampires then proceed to have a sort of sexual intercourse in Akasha's home where they mutually feed on one another. During which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her. Empowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires at the home of Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who is an Ancient Vampire. The Ancient Vampires were planning to kill Akasha, to save the human world from demise. Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse as The Queen sees her both as an enemy and as food as she is Maharet's mortal niece and Maharet is a big enemy of Akasha's. Queen Akasha also wanted to make an example out of Jesse because Jesse dared to stand-up to her and to put fear into the other vampires. Lestat ostensibly obeys the Queen, but afterwards he quickly comes to his senses and is released from her power. He then very angrily turns and begins to drain Akasha's blood with the help of the Ancients. Mael and Pandora are killed by Akasha's power. Armand is almost killed, but is saved as The Queen's powers diminish. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, and thereby ends up becoming a marble ""statue"". Maharet then becomes the new Queen Of the Damned.Lestat then turns and walks to where Jesse is lying lifeless, and cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood, turning her into a vampire. Jesse, now a vampire, and Lestat then return the journal to the Talamasca, and walk away, among mortals, into the night. As they exit it is shown that they are now a couple and hold hands while Marius enters the Talamasca. The film closes with a scene of David reading the journal as Marius's voice catches his attention, cheerfully saying, ""Hello, David.""",Queen of the Damned
506,ss_luvgh,It had potential. Oh it had potential!,1,8 October 2006,"This movie was horrendous, and is definitely not worth your time, nor money. I must admit, this movie had potential, but in the end some major factors made this movie rot.First of all, aside from probably the names of the character, this movie respected nothing of Anne Rice's enthralling book. Oh yes I know,to those who haven't read the book it doesn't matter much. But you see,it does because those who haven't read it are deprived of the depth of the characters, and their powerful inter-relations with each other and the whole 'human' aspect of the book. All of which made the book so appealing. The whole point of the book! Some characters were excluded from the movies, characters that carry import to the plot, such as Mekare, Maharet's twin and the sorrowful Legend of the Twins, Armand, Daniel, and Louis and Gabrielle, both Lestat's fledglings and lovers. Akasha had a whole maddened plan to bring peace on Earth. You see, Akasha isn't evil. She is simply single-minded and selfish, lost in her own reasoning. So many characters had so much to offer. And the movie failed to deliver that, which made the characters utterly one-dimensional, and not ones the audience can relate to. It stripped so much of the book, which saddens me, because believe me the book was wonderful. I find some scenes were completely irrelevant, and that they could have been replaced with some decent book-respecting ones. There were a considerable amount of factual errors.Second of all, the acting and faulty accents was enough to make me want to cringe.Also, the movie was too fast-paced. I know, I know, a movie cannot last eight hours to fully capture the profoundness of a character or action, but honestly! The whole Jesse/Lestat love affair could have blossomed if only they had some decent dialog and a little more time! It was like everything had to be hurried. A two-minute scene with Jesse and boom! He has a soft spot for her. Give me a break. Make it believable at least!By the way, Lestat's singing was horrible. He sounded tone-deaf.So I leave you with one advice: go to the library, loan the book and read it. Well I would advice you to start from the first tome (""Interview with the Vampire""). It is such a worthwhile experience to discover Anne Rice's awing piece of literature.",Queen of the Damned
507,metheomnipotent,Useless,2,4 July 2005,"I had read the book before i watched the movie, and as they say, the movie is never as good as the book. So i didn't go in expecting much, yet i was still very disappointed. First Marius didn't create Lestat. It seems that Lestat is only living with Marius for a day or two, when it was much longer. Tons of characters are missing. Maharet seems to have no power, even though she is one of the oldest vampires. Akasha whisks Lestat away from the concert. wtf!! All the hair colors and styles are wrong, except the red-heads. Nothing about the history of anyone. What happened to the temple in the mountains where she killed whoever that vampire was and all his followers? What happened to Daniel? And WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR MIND-READINGPOWERS??? all in all a lame, lame movie. granted, if you haven't read the book then it may entertain you, but knowing what really 'happened',i felt so cheated.

The plot was incoherent, the dialog was no more than blubbering, and the actors were jokes. The books were wonderful. This movie definitely does not follow Anne Rice's writings. Set this aside and you still have one monstrous disaster of a movie.This movie was an example in how to milk more dollars out of an unassuming public by leaching off the name of a hit.This movie was so bad that I haven't paid for another movie in a theater since... and this has been several years. I know it's not fair to the other multi-million dollar movies out there, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.Ignore all advice to ""Just Have Fun"" with it, this is what robs us of our intelligence.

The setting is Gothic and it has all the trappings of Gothic setting with gray stone walls and stone gargoyles and Egyptian dresses etc. You can compare it to movies like 'UnderWorld', though the stories of both the movies are totally different from each other. But the idea that the world is shared by both mortals and immortals and the way they roam about freely amongst us is very similar.Stuart Townsend, after the initial shock of seeing him milky white with dark circles around his eyes dressed in weird clothes, grows on you. He acts well as a dark brooding lonely figure with macabre sense of humor. Aaliya as queen Akasha looks very pretty, but was really too young to play a powerful negative character. Besides she looks too young to be the mother of all vampires. The actress who played Jesse looks older than Townsend, but she seems to act well. Vincent as Marius is very good.",Queen of the Damned

The book in itself was not very good either, but what's always most important is that a movie be based on the book it was made after. I honestly think that the only thing this movie had in common with the original book were the names of the characters affiliated.The actors were all good, even though some chosen did not fit the book's description of the characters they portrayed (i.e. Marius, Akasha, David Talbot, etc.). These people really would have had a chance to shine if only the screenplay were done with better effort.The book ""Queen of the Damned"" contains so many different characters that at first it becomes tough to catch on and follow along with the story. If you have not read the books, ""The Vampire Lestat"", and ""Queen of the Damned"" prior to seeing this movie, you are guaranteed to feel confused. It moves at a very fast pace, and deletes many scenes that are critical to the story's plot...not to mention that some of the characters that DO appear in this movie are never introduced, so when you start seeing a gang of goofy looking vampires near the end, you're going to wonder, ""Who in the hell is that?""",Queen of the Damned

524,kolcsar_mihai,i hated the movie,3,7 August 2006,"OK OK...good acting from stuart townsend, aaliyah was very seductive i have to admit this (OK OK, very good special effects, good goth rock, even i don't like goth rock...i don't want you to think that i am being ignorant of this things) but still let's face it the movie only scored this good because aaliyah's death(someone had to say it), it would have gone directly to video if not for that extremely tragic accident...i mean the story was poor(a very sad reap-off of the novel, i wonder how rice alowed the novel, which was brilliantly constructed and much more complicated, i mean the movie left out almost every single crucial plot point)... and we ended up with this junk, i mean the fact that none of the vampire's names who attacked akasha wasn't mentioned in the movie but they appear in the credits... i mean please...",Queen of the Damned
525,elphaba15,Disappointment,4,29 March 2006,"I only give this movie a bad rating because the movie is nothing like the book. At fifteen i have read and admired all the books from the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles and i was greatly disappointed in the way Queen of the Damned was depicted. it told nothing of the red haired twins or the Talamasca and the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was far more interesting. it is my belief that if you want to make a book into a movie you should make it as close as possible to the book. However, this movie wasn't even close. they never even explained the real reason for Akasha's rampage of killing. Once again, i was disappointed.",Queen of the Damned
