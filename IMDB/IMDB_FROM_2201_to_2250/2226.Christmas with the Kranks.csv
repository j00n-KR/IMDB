0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not quite a Christmas turkey, but it is still rather dire",3,8 January 2011,"Christmas with the Kranks is far from the best Christmas movie, but it is not the worst either, that's Deck the Halls. That said, despite a nice soundtrack, decent camera work and scenery and a talented cast that includes Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd it is pretty bad. A lot of the problem is the film's humour, there are some raise-a-smile sight gags, but overall it is very unfunny and predictable. The story is also rather bland and has some dumb, incoherent parts, complete with a cloying, cliché ending. The direction is lacking too, and the pace is lethargic. The cast do try their best, and they do have some good moments and decent chemistry, but they deserved much more with a tighter script and direction. The real problem with Christmas with the Kranks is the lack of Christmas spirit, at the end of the day it all comes across as cold and mean-spirited. Overall, not absolutely dreadful but with the cast as talented as they are it should have been better. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Christmas with the Kranks
1,SnoopyStyle,Tim Allen is a prick and Jamie Lee Curtis is scared little housewife,2,1 December 2013,"When their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) leaves home to go to Peru for the Peace Corp, Luther Krank (Tim Allen) decides to skip Christmas and go on a cruise with his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis). He refuses to do anything related to Christmas causing resentment from the rest of the neighbors led by Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd).Tim Allen usually plays arrogant pompous pricks. This character is best balanced out by somebody more reasonable. The resulting conflict is where the comedy comes from. In this movie, Tim Allen plays an especially large prick. The problem is Jamie Lee Curtis plays such a weak compliant partner. She is some kind of scared '50s housewife. The partnership doesn't generate any comedy at all.Then there are the neighbors. They are too annoying. In fact, everybody in this movie are too annoying, well everybody except the cancer lady. They are as ridiculous and unreasonable as Luther Krank. Luther Krank writes a letter to everybody telling them that he's not Scrouge, but that's what this is. The big disappointment is Jamie Lee Curtis. She's suppose to fight back. Without that, there is no comedy. It's just a lot of annoying people bickering.",Christmas with the Kranks
2,Prismark10,Skipping Christmas,3,4 December 2016,"This film is actually based on a John Grisham novel but is a misguided misfire that has little by way of symbolism relating to the Christian meaning of Christmas. For goodness sake you have a Catholic priest hanging round a party on Christmas Eve instead of preparing for midnight mass.Luther Krank (Tim Allen) upsets his neighbourhood as he decides not to take in Christmas festivities and instead go on a Caribbean cruise with his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) as their daughter has now left home and joined the Peace Corps. His neighbours are upset with this Scrooge like attitude and try to coerce and shame them into celebrating Christmas like decking the halls, buying gifts and putting Frosty the Snowman up on the roof just as everyone else on the street has done.The film gets syrupy and manipulative at the end as their daughter at the last minute decides to spend Christmas with her family and wants to introduce them to her new fiancé. This means succumbing to the commercialisation of Christmas and now at the last minute they need to buy a tree, honey ham and invite everyone around to their party.This is an artificial and uneven film with a mixed message that relies on Home Alone type antics for a few laughs. No surprise there as it is written by Chris Columbus who directed Home Alone 1 & 2 and directed by Joe Roth who was Head of 20th Century Fox when Home Alone 1 & 2 were released.",Christmas with the Kranks
3,gavin6942,Tolerable Christmas Mush,6,28 November 2014,"With their daughter away, her parents (Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen) decide to skip Christmas altogether until she decides to come home, causing an uproar when they have to celebrate the holidays at the last minute.What makes this film somewhat bizarre is just how spiteful the neighbors are to turn on the Kranks for their lack of holiday cheer. Skipping Christmas to save money is sensible, especially if the kids are grown up and their are no grandkids. This seems reasonable, but instead the neighbors all attack the family and even the police get testy.This odd premise makes the film a bit hard to swallow, but it still has its enjoyable moments. When Tim Allen acts as though he has received a Botox injection, that is just comedy gold (although it may be dated... that seems to be a fad no longer in vogue). Dan Ackroyd is strong, but unfortunately not playing a funny role.",Christmas with the Kranks
4,jboothmillard,Christmas with the Kranks,1,16 January 2011,"I may have watched this film a week or two after Christmas had come to an end, but I missed it when it as on and I had the chance to watch it, so I decided to do so, from director Joe Roth (America's Sweethearts). Basically the Krank family are saying goodbye to only daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) as she is off to a Peace Corps assignment in Peru after Thanksgiving, so parents Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) are going to be alone at Christmas. Luther has an idea that means he and Nora will skip Christmas and not have to go through all the commercialism nonsense the normally do, he is planning a Caribbean cruise for him and Nora. All the neighbours hear about their plan however, and the know that the ranks normally embrace Christmas quite a lot, including putting their favoured Frosty the Snowman up on the roof, and they are not happy. So whenever Luther and Nora refuse something Christmassy or charitable because of their plans, the neighbours are going even more against them, maybe even trying to show how much they should be celebrating the season and not going anywhere. Of course the Kranks quickly change their mind about the tree, decorations and charity as soon as a phone call from Blair confirmed that she is coming home early for Christmas Eve dinner with her new fiancé. So with the neighbours turned nice again and agreeing to help the Kranks are doing their best to make a welcome party the best they can. After spending time with all the neighbours, including Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) and unfamiliar guy who knows everyone Marty (Austin Pendleton), the umbrella Santa, the cruise doesn't look doable. Luther decides that he should not be selfish, and he gives away the cruise tickets to the Scheels, Walt (Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh) and Bev (Elizabeth Franz) to stay home with Nora, Blair and the fiancé. Also starring Erik Per Sullivan as Spike Frohmeyer, Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Officer Salino, Jake Busey as Officer Treen, Kevin Chamberlin as Mr. Scanlon and Tom Poston as Father Zabriskie. Allen is used to silly Christmas films after playing Santa Claus three times, Curtis is a comic talent who is wasting her time, well, everyone involved is. The treatment of the two main characters is completely unfair with the whole skipping Christmas thing, it may make a little point that commercialism is very high, but even after this passes, you haven't had one laugh, and you never do throughout, a stupid and unfunny seasonal comedy. Poor!",Christmas with the Kranks
5,paul_haakonsen,Wholesome Christmas movie...,6,24 December 2015,"While ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is surely an entertaining enough movie, it is not going to be a Christmas classic such as the 1989 ""Christmas Vacation"" movie. That being said, then it should be stressed that ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a wholesome movie that does prove entertaining enough for the entire family.The story is about Luther Krank (played by Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) whom are living in a small, tightly-knitted community where the Christmas season is a major event. And when Frank and Nora decides to skip Christmas and go on a cruise the entire neighborhood is turned upside down in disbelief.There are some hilarious moments throughout the movie, and the cast list was really great, having some impressive names on it. Aside from Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, then the movie also had Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmet Walsh, Cheech Marin and Jake Busey on the cast list. So you know what you are getting here, and people do deliver. There are also some good laughs here and there, which do of course add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.But as I said earlier, it will not be a Christmas classic, as in it being a movie that you watch every Christmas. I have just watched it now, and I don't think that I will be making a return trip to watch it again.",Christmas with the Kranks
6,tavm,Christmas is a slightly enjoyable holiday movie,4,18 December 2007,"Christmas with the Kranks is a slightly amusing, slightly heartwarming slapstick comedy starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curits as the title couple who initially want to skip the holidays because their only offspring, a daughter, is leaving the country to join the Peace Corps. In fact, Luther Krank is planning to leave with his wife for a cruise on that very day. As a result, they get harassed by the neighbors led by Dan Aykroyd. Other neighbors include M. Emmet Walsh, Felicity Huffman, Caroline Rhea. There's also a couple of cops (Cheech Marin, Jake Busey) who Luther refuses to buy the annual police calendar from. Also appearing are David L. Lander, who I fondly remember as Squiggy on ""Laverne and Shirley"", as a tanning customer who causes Curtis to hit her head on the tanning bed and, in his last role, the late Tom Poston as a priest who discovers Jamie in her bikini after she goes to the receptionist for a band-aid. Those scenes were funny as were those between Allen and a white cat that he keeps stepping on (also loved when the cat got frozen with only the eyes moving) and his botox scene when he has trouble putting things in his mouth. Others were either too frantic or too predictable. Best surprise was Austin Pendleton as someone no one knows at first but then Allen remembers from somewhere else. Like I said, this wasn't very funny but by the end I was willing to overlook many of the film's flaws and just enjoy the celebration that filled the last 30 minutes with wonderful singing from Aykroyd and nice accompaniment from Marin, Busey, and especially Poston in his final minutes of screen time. Oh, and Rhea and Huffman are completely wasted in their few minutes as Curtis' neighbors. Still, a tolerable time waster from screenwriter Chris Columbus who adopted John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"", and director Joe Roth.",Christmas with the Kranks
7,wes-connors,Roth and Allen Krank It Up,2,2 December 2014,"When their beautiful blonde daughter goes off to spend Christmas in the Peace Corps, apparently wealthy suburban Chicago couple Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis (as Luther and Nora Krank) decide to skip celebrating the holiday. For unexplained reasons, Mr. Allen needs to save money. He figures to save around $3,000 by taking Ms. Curtis on a Caribbean cruise. Allen later says, ""It's not about the money."" Well, he and Curtis plan to wear skimpy bikinis and copulate on days other than Saturday. Allen's neighbors are miffed. They especially miss seeing the Kranks decorate their house and lawn. Every year, Allen puts a ""Frosty the Snowman"" ornament on his roof. Jolly challenged Dan Aykroyd (as Vic Frohmeyer) leads a campaign to free Frosty...Everything changes when their daughter decides to come home for the holiday, after all. Now, the Kranks must arrange their annual Christmas party and decorate at lightning speed...Allen and director Joe Roth rely on a lot of physical comedy. None of it is especially funny. Partially, this is because the story makes little sense. The unappealing leading man has been very popular on television and stand-up comedy. Here, he may simply be out of his element. There is filmmaking competence evident. For example, the editing and camera-work during Curtis' supermarket pursuit of a holiday ham would have worked in a better movie. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is garish and obnoxious. It celebrates blanketing your house with lights, conforming to the crowd, and gross materialism. Some TV airings delete most of the ""speedo and bikini"" scene involving Allen and Curtis. You may only see the best of Curtis' bikini. Count your blessings.** Christmas with the Kranks (11/15/04) Joe Roth ~ Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmet Walsh",Christmas with the Kranks
8,michaelRokeefe,It won't seem like Christmas without you.,5,18 November 2005,"Chris Columbus is responsible for this comedic screenplay of a John Grisham novel. Put the nix on Christmas. Just skip the holiday. Luther(Tim Allen)and Nora(Jamie Lee Curtis)Krank set about to put the kibosh on the usual Norman Rockwell holiday doings by taking a sea cruise. With their daughter away for the first time; there is no reason to decorate or even put Frosty on the roof. The neighborhood is in shock and dismay...no Kranks for Christmas. Uh oh, Blair Krank(Julie Gonzalo)decides to come home; now Luther and Nora need to rush about to prepare for the holiday after all. Situational comedy that gets old in a hurry.

9,sunwarrior13,One Might Be Tempted To Skip Christmas After Viewing It,3,14 November 2014,"Christmas with the Kranks is a Christmas comedy that was based on the novel by John Grisham known as Skipping Christmas.It stars Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis.The plot is about a couple who decided to skip the Christmas celebrations for the year as their daughter isn't with them to celebrate it.However,things begin to change when they received a phone call from her and providing him the big news.Well,everyone probably already knows what's going to happen next.This was total disaster.It was unfunny and unoriginal.No wonder it was bashed by the critics and moviegoers alike.There is nothing added to the celebration of the holidays upon watching this film.The jokes are corny and the emotions does not even generate anything positive and special at all.Despite of having a great and talented cast,they basically could not even lift its screenplay to becoming at least an average film and it did not do any justice at all to Grisham's readable non-legal thriller.What's worse,one might be even tempted to skip Christmas after seeing it.",Christmas with the Kranks
10,Scarecrow-88,Christmas with the Kranks,3,21 December 2015,"There's an actual scene where Jamie Lee Curtis is going after a runaway ham she paid way too much for and Tim Allen is almost arrested for ""borrowing a Christmas tree"". It is one of those unfortunate comedy misfires that seemed to pop up a lot around 2004 (like the awful Ben Affleck flick, Surviving Christmas), with too good a cast to be stuck in. Allen nearly kills himself while trying to put a Frosty Snowman figure on the very top of his roof, decides to forgo Christmas with the whole neighborhood up in arms and laying it to them thick for doing so, and purposely plasters water on his driveway so that noisy carolers will slip and fall (!) pretty establishing himself as a major bone of contention during the Holiday Season. Allen wants to use the money normally spent on Christmas festivities and his daughter (gone away to work for the Peace Corps) for a cruise with his wife, but the neighbors are not happy with his decision. Dan Aykroyd is kind of the neighborhood watchdog, a type of respected voice considered a high authority. If he is displeased, then the community backs him. At first, Allen will not decorate, including the Frosty displaythis is considered a standard that the neighborhood expects and demands. Allen is at odds with old man M. Emmet Walsh (whose wife is battling cancer), particularly his cat. Their relationship, no matter how strained, doesn't stop Curtis from caring about Walsh and his wife. The film is desperate for laughs: there is a scene where Curtis is attempting to get a tan in a tanning salon, in a bikini, with Tom Poston's priest, among other passersby, catching an eyeful and unable to look elsewhere, while Allen has a botox injection, unable to eat or drink! And the uproar to get a party and decorations together at Allen and Curtis' house before their daughter and her fiancé arrive is a bit far-fetched and rather silly (why not just tell Blair they had planned a cruise and, reason being, her absence was the catalyst in this decision? She is a big girl and can handle disappointment. It is her fault for springing on them her arrival), but the point of it all is for the Kranks to repair their rift with the neighborhood and to show how the holiday spirit would bring about a coming together and forgiveness. Oh, and the movie wouldn't be complete without a Peruvian ballad! Oh, brother. And Arthur Pendelton, as Marty, who knows people but no one knows him! Cheech Marin and Jake Busey are two cops who have a disregard for Allen over his not buying a calendar from them while not contributing to the cub scouts in buying a tree sets off the animosity of the neighborhood against them. Allen could give tickets to a cruise to two neighbors at the end, but it takes Curtis scolding him in order to do ithe's quite a dick. Curtis, stuck in Christmas sweater and a mop of hair, is too sexy for this rather unflatteringly plain part. This is pretty much exactly as its reputation suggestsnot a particularly worthwhile experience. The cast tries hard but the material utterly fails them. It is hard to fathom a neighborhood would give a rat's ass about Allen enough for him to be rescued from a deserved humbling.",Christmas with the Kranks
11,lastliberal,You're skipping Christmas! Isn't that against the law?,5,2 December 2007,"It was Tim Allen's second film (The Santa Clause), and the first where he was the star, that stands as the only film he has done that I would recommend watching. I am not a fan of Allen and never will be. The fact that he was beaten by none other than Adam Sandler for an award says it all.But, we did get to see the great Jamie Lee Curtis, who played his wife, and Dan Aykroyd, who shone as the the neighborhood ruler.The story was funny at times, but too predictable in the neighborhood from hell.So, skip this and watch The Santa Clause.",Christmas with the Kranks
12,zardoz-13,"""Christmas With The Kranks"" isn't worth a bah-humbug!",1,18 March 2005,"The trailer for the Tim Allen comedy ''Christmas With The Kranks"" (* out of ****)promises a lot more merriment that this yuletide yawner yields. ""America's Sweethearts"" director Joe Roth and ""Harry Potter"" scenarist Chris Columbus serve up strictly warmed-over, recycled laughs in this modern day rendition of ""Scrooge,"" and their gags lost whatever their spontaneity that they may have had over twenty years ago. Imagine how hilarious it is to see Tim Allen plunge off a roof as he struggles to place a huge snowman up there? Imagine how hilarious it is to see people fall down on an iced-over front lawn? Or how about the scene where a guy nearly electrocutes himself putting up Christmas lights? Of course, we're supposed to guffaw when Jamie Lee Curtis accidentally crashes a supermarket buggy into product display stand. The only thing worse than this hackneyed hokum is seeing both leads humiliate themselves by cavorting in Speedos and a bikini. Far past their athletic prime, Allen and Curtis should conceal all that cottage cheese. Things might have been funnier with younger leads. This half-cynical, half-sentimental drivel about an upper-middle-class, suburban, Chicago couple who decide to skip Christmas and take a Caribbean cruise plays like a 1950's tale of conformity in the Joseph McCarthy era when everybody feared that Communists were lurking under their bed. Predictably, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" celebrates the holiday on the alter of consumerism gone mad. Religious references are held to a minimum, and the message is that you should decorate your house so it resembles an intergalactic eye-sore with a constellation of multi-colored lights, snowmen, reindeer, and Saint Clauses. Bestselling author John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"" serves as the basis of this forgettable farce. Incredibly, there isn't a lawyer in the story or a scene in a courtroom! Luther (Tim Allen of ""The Santa Clause"" movies) and Nora Krank (James Lee Curtis of ""True Lies"") have spent the last 20 years celebrating Christmas with their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo of ""Dodge Ball"") in the Windy City with expensive house decorations and costly holiday social gatherings. As the movie opens, our protagonists bid their daughter goodbye. Blair has joined the Peace Corps and is heading off for South America. Christmas just isn't Christmas anymore, because their daughter has flown the coop. Luther gets to thinking about things. An upper-level manager at an accounting firm, he calculates that he drops $6-thousand dollars each year at Christmas on food, gifts, and parties. Luther discovers that for half the cost, Nora and he could spend ten days lounging in the Caribbean. No sooner has Nora okayed the idea than the neighbors start to harass our heroes about their anti-Christmas mind-set. A greeting card clerk berates Nora in a public restaurant for her refusal to buy seasonal cards. Their ward boss of a neighbor Vic Frohmeyer (paunchy Dan Aykroyd of ""Ghostbusters"") gives them withering looks, and the subdivision where they live tries to bully them into putting up Christmas lights and shelling out to charities. The Kranks even refuse to buy a police's calendar when two policemen (Cheech Marin of TV's ""Nash Bridges"" and Jake Busey of ""Starship Troopers"") come calling for their annual contribution. In fact, everybody in the neighborhood reacts with shock, suspicion, and contempt when the Kranks refuse to honor a holiday tradition. One character accuses the Kranks of being Jewish. Just as Luther and Nora battle their neighbors, they receive a phone call. Not only is Blair coming home suddenly from Peru, but she is also bringing a native that she plans to marry. Suddenly, Luther and Nora revert to tradition and their neighbors help them in their last minute attempt to deck their halls with boughs of holly. When ""Christmas With The Kranks"" isn't behaving anti-Semitic, the movie acts anti-African-American. Of course, any predominantly Caucasian subdivision in a movie must have its token black characters. A black couple loans Luther their Christmas tree because they are clearing out of town to stay with relatives.Director Joe Roth just doesn't know when he has beaten a stale gag to death. In one scene, the neighbors besiege the Kranks and demand that they bring out their giant snowman and display him on the roof. Luther and Nora dodge from room to room to avoid them, but the neighbors follow them from window to window. Later, an obnoxious neighbor (veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh of ""Raising Arizona"") invites a truckload of gung ho Christmas carolers to serenade the Kranks with expected results. Worse, the humor sinks like lead and the story is so prefabricated that Allen, Curtis, and Aykroyd sleep walk through their one-note roles. One gag that gets repeated ad nauseam has Allen tromping on a cat's tail. Matters aren't helped when the cat owner turns out to be a poor old lady suffering from incurable cancer.""Christmas With The Kranks"" isn't worth a bah-humbug.",Christmas with the Kranks
13,anaconda-40658,Left Me Cranky.,1,26 January 2016,"Christmas with the Kranks (2004): Dir: Joe Roth / Cast: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmet Walsh, Cheech Marin: If the family name is any indication as to how one is to respond to this film, then this is one of the poorest excuses for holiday entertainment. When their daughter is unable to be home for Christmas, Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip the holiday to go on a cruise, which doesn't set well with the neighbors. The first problem with this garbage is the actions of the neighbors. They protest when the Kranks fail to place Frosty the Snowman on their roof. Why is this any of their business? They harass this couple in a way that is more disturbing than funny. The premise is rushed with jokes that fail miserably and an ending that is phony. Director Joe Roth does his best with the flimsy sets but Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis labor under flat material. Both are terrific performers deserving of material worthy of their talent, which isn't this. Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmet Walsh and Richard ""Cheech"" Marin play meddling neighbors and not only is this trash bad for the obvious talent involved, the characters being so unlikeable that it tarnishes any empathy that viewers could have. Regardless of any moral contrivance this film is garbage disguised as fun filled holiday holly jolly dancing crap. The film is so mean spirited that it will likely leave you cranky.

14,movieman_kev,"Stick to courtroom dramas, Mr. Grisham",3,16 March 2006,"When Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Curtis respectively) decide to take a sea cruise in leu of having a Christmas of an kind, in part because their daughter Blair will be in the Peace Corps, their neighbors don't take the news particularly well, which draws the ire of Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) the self-proclaimed 'head of the neighborhood'. A battle of wits ensues (pardon my laughter, I just never thought I'd go nowhere NEAR typing the word 'wit' in relation to this movie).It's the little things that make this movie not worth watching. Such small nitpicks as Allen and Curtis not having any sort of chemistry whatsoever, and the film not being particularly funny or clever or what have you, but my biggest gripe is that the usually talented John Grisham choose to stray from what he does best (ie. courtroom dramas), but hopefully the mind-blowing travesty that this film is has proved for him not to deviate from his true talent.Where I saw it: Starz on Demand My Grade: D",Christmas with the Kranks
15,SimonJack,The Grinch did NOT steal this Christmas.,9,10 April 2011,"But he sure seemed to have stolen the hearts and sense of humor of many who have watched and commented on this film. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a mostly clean, clever and witty, film without the vulgar and crass stuff of so many other more recent ""holiday"" movies. It's a great comedy that's fit for the whole family, although the humor will be mostly understood by the older kids and adults. I just came across the film when organizing my library, and recalled the poor rating it got but how much fun it was to me. So, these comments are written in the spring with the film still fresh in my mind – that's how good it is. What's not to like about this movie? It covers so much of what happens in middle America when Christmas rolls around. But, here's a family whose only child is grown and she's off to work in a social program in a foreign country. So mom and dad can skip all the usual holiday chores and regalia in their neighborhood, go away on a romantic cruise alone, and still save money. Then the complications set in, and what a hoot as Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis go from one miscue to another with neighbors and friends. It's got a great cast, and everyone delivers well. What's funnier than Tim's fruit cocktail dribbling down his chin because he can't close his mouth to chew after receiving a Botox injection? Or, Jamie Lee stepping out of a tanning parlor dressed only in her bikini right in the middle of a mall crowd of onlookers – including her parish priest? Or Dan Aykroyd, the neighborhood ringmaster, organizing the rescue effort to set up the Kranks' Christmas house when daughter Blair changes her mind and flies home. This movie is full of gaffes and laughs, one-after-another, as Tim ""Grinch"" Allen gets back into the Christmas spirit with family and neighbors. Of all the very funny Christmas holiday movies over the years – there are some quite good ones a few decades back (black and white), I rank ""Christmas with the Kranks"" right behind the very best one – National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. So, don't listen to the sour faces who have no sense of humor, or who don't dig clean fun. Watch this film with family and friends around the holidays this year and next – or at any time in between. Unless you're a Grinch, you're sure to enjoy it.",Christmas with the Kranks
16,StevePulaski,Do we really want people (including our children) seeing a movie like this?,1,18 December 2012,"What kind of Christmas movie is this? Christmas With the Kranks is not jolly, whimsical, wholesome, or humorous like the typical American Christmas film, but a wretched, loathsome comedy capitalizing on the things the holiday season isn't about such as competition, self-centeredness, cruelty, and worst of all, conformity.The American Christmas movies fall in three possible categories, the great, the good, and the bad, like most films in specific genres, although it's quickly shortening to two, the good and the bad, with emphasis on the bad. Christmas classics are those such as A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and White Christmas, which cloud the networks annually, with their cherishable whimsy, and incredibly earnest presence. Christmas trash are films like Christmas With the Kranks and Jack Frost; films that take a contrived, corny idea and make the near-fatal flaw of not satirizing their material and taking them seriously, creating a forced and awkward atmosphere. But this is just a grain of salt compared to the number of problems with this film.The films pairs Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, two wonderful stars playing two horribly unlikable characters, Luther and Nora Krank. They're a suburban couple who has just sent their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) on a plane after Thanksgiving for a Peace Corps in Peru, leaving both of them to contemplate how to spend the Christmas holiday alone. Luther has a proposal; after spending well over $6,000 on Christmas decorations, he feels they could take a $3,000 cruise and have plenty to show for it. The only catch is that they'd miss Christmas, not decorate for it, and completely overhaul plans to host a party and send Christmas cards.Seems like a fine idea to me, but the film makes a controversial setup explode by having the neighbors (mainly the neighborhood ""king"" Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd) overreact to the idea of the Krank's taking a year off. They are infuriated at their proposal, ostracizing them, manipulating them by excessive caroling, crowding around their house demanding they return ""Frost,"" an iconic staple of the neighborhood. Good lord, this is the kind of thing you do if you discovered noted hate-monger Fred Phelps was your neighbor. Not if you found out your neighbor simply wants to take a year off from Christmas by doing the kind, noble event of taking his wife on a cruise.The Krank couple is content with fighting them off, until their daughter calls a few days before Christmas and says she can make it home for the holidays with her new Peruvian fiancée. This sends both Luther and Nora into a scurrying state, accentuating the character trait I hate seeing portrayed cartoonishly and that's desperation. Desperation as a form of urgency and poignancy, where one character is genuinely at a loss and trying to do right but is consistently barricaded by unforeseen, unforgiving circumstances is one thing, but being played for laughs is another.In one terribly depressing sequence, we see Nora Krank, after being informed of her daughter's unexpected arrival, rushes to the grocery store to get hickory honey ham, because it's her daughter's absolute favorite. She races an old woman through the whole store (guess who gets the damn ham?), and then pleas a young couple with an infant to buy the ham off them for larger than the sticker price. Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis (In one what be her final starring role until 2010's You Again, which I hear was roughly the same degree of appalling as this one) desperately succumb to petulant beginning for a damned ham, as if the store didn't carry turkey or normal ham as a substitute, is incredibly unfunny. Then when she finally gets the family to cough up the ham for a large sum of money (after bringing up their kid's future), she is bumped and it rolls down the steep pavement into the middle of the road to be crushed by a sixteen-wheeler. Curtis then leads out a blood-curdling scream similar to the one she released in Carpenter's Halloween, when she had a better reason to shriek.The nail that drops into the coffin for this film is that it takes the somewhat original idea of portraying the Krank's as non-conformists, but then collectively makes them into the enemy to the point where they give in to the neighbors' orders of celebrating the holidays. Since when did celebrating Christmas have to involve a tree, lights, ornaments, parties, cards, caroling, and neighborly devotion? Since when did the message of being an individual and being unique, things we've been told since birth, be traded for the message of conformity by force? It's appalling to believe this film got past the stage of production, let alone the fact that Chris Columbus found this material acceptable to be placed on screen during the season of love and jolliness. It's also incredibly saddening to hear Columbus was the same man who directed both Home Alone films and the wonderfully potent Goonies. And please don't get me started on the persistent incorporation of unnecessary, grueling animal cruelty. It's unwarranted in almost any movie, but here, it's simply unacceptable.Christmas With the Kranks contains no laughs, humor, love, or anything resembling that of a competent holiday picture. It drains the talent of its two stars by making both of them succumb to something stupid such as Tim Allen's Luther getting botox, with a terribly unfunny sequence of him trying to eat something when it keeps falling out his mouth, and Jamie Lee Curtis' trying to get a tan in a mall tanning salon and finding herself exposed in the middle of the shop. Not only is this movie terribly not funny, but it's pathetically unconvincing; especially when it tacks on a mawkish ending that just oozes cutesy sentimentality.Starring: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Dan Aykroyd.

17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Yeah, it's stupid, but cut it some slack",5,2 January 2007,"It seems like on IMDb, a lot of people bash the newer Christmas movies, which in some ways I can understand, because most of the older movies could never ever be touched like A Christmas Story or It's A Wonderful Life, but I think we do need to be more open to these new family Christmas movies. I borrowed this movie from my friend and both her and I agree that it really wasn't all that bad. Although that it reminded me of another very bad 7th Heaven episode, I have to admit that I laughed a couple times, you have to just let up about these types of movies.The Krank's daughter, Blaire, has just gone away for the Peace Corps. and she will be away for a year, figuring it might be a good chance to think of only themselves, the parents decide to skip Christmas. But the Christmas loving neighborhood won't hear of it, they have their hearts set on getting the Kranks to love Christmas again and get all the decorations out along with the annual Chrismas Eve party they through. But they won't hear of it... until Blaire unexpectedly decides to come home for Christmas with a big surprise! Over all, I wouldn't say that this was a fantastic Christmas movie, but it wasn't a bad one at all. It had flaws, a lot of movies do, but we need to cut it a break. You have got to admit the botox scene with Tim was pretty funny, even if it was a little over the top. So, honestly, just let go and have fun, you can't take this type of movie seriously, otherwise, what's the point of watching it if you just expect bad? 5/10",Christmas with the Kranks
18,DKosty123,High School Math Wrong,4,23 December 2007,"In high school math, or was it 5th grade, I was taught that the whole equals the sum of its parts. Never is that less true than in this film. There is lots of talent in this cast. Sadly it is the last major supporting film role for Tom Poston who recently died. When you look at the cast, it makes you expect a pretty good film. When you look at the results, you realize that it is possible to get much less than you expect. This film definitely delivers.The film was done at a time when Tim Allen was having career problems. Maybe that is part of the problem. Dan Ackroyd appears to be having them in this film too. Maybe it is just the script? If your tired of classic holiday films, try this out to reverse that trend.",Christmas with the Kranks

20,sddavis63,Not A Great Addition To The Christmas Movie Collection,3,29 November 2011,"In keeping with many Christmas-themed movies, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" has the almost obligatory heartwarming scene at the end where a person is magically transformed in some mysterious way and comes to realize the real meaning of Christmas (well, not the ""real"" real meaning - not the birth of Jesus, I mean - but the other ""real"" meaning; you know, being kind and generous and thinking about others - which is fine.) It was a nice ending as Luther Krank (played by Tim Allen) sacrifices something that was very important to him (a Caribbean cruise) in order to brighten the lives of an elderly couple with health issues and seeks nothing from them in return. Nice. I'm glad he did that. But aside from the obligatory Christmas transformation of the ""scrooge"" character, there was very little charm in this movie. As a parody of the secular Christmas I suppose it made some points, but it wasn't an especially fun or pleasant movie to watch, in spite of the efforts of a very talented cast - including Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd in addition to Allen.)There are two things going on here. The first is Luther's desire to just get away from the whole Christmas scene after daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) goes to Peru with the Peace Corps. To accomplish that he refuses to have anything to do with the trappings (including the giving and receiving of gifts - although, given his fanaticism on the issue, I wondered where the Christmas wreath on the front door came from!) of Christmas, but he does so in a rather cold-hearted way toward those friends and neighbours who normally partake of the Kranks' Christmas Eve party or his co-workers who normally receive gifts from him. Now, if Luther's boycott was intended to make a point about over-indulgence during the Christmas season, it might have worked, except that Luther simply wanted to take the money that he and Nora (Curtis) would normally spend on Christmas and treat himself (and Nora) to a fancy Caribbean cruise. So there's nothing noble about Luther's motives. They're totally self-serving. In contrast to Luther is the neighbourhood they live in, headed by the deceivingly friendly boss of the street Vic Frohmeyer (Aykroyd.) The neighbourhood apparently demands that everyone take part in meaningless rituals like putting up fake snowmen, and the absence of Frosty from the Kranks' home seems to be all that they really care about - and it reaches the point where the neighbourhood almost seems to become a frightening mob at their front door demanding Frosty's appearance, while Nora cowers in the bedroom. There's even a thinly veiled criticism of various charities and community groups (the Scouts and the Police Benevolent Fund come to mind) using the holiday to raise money, even though they have no particularly clear connection to Christmas. Yeah, there's a statement in all that, but it leaves no one in the movie especially likable.As Christmas movies go there are those that are more fun, and there are those that make the point far more clearly.

21,Buddy-51,Christmas turkey,2,10 December 2005,"The Kranks live in a neighborhood inhabited by Christmas Nazis - evil elves whose idea of holiday spirit is making all the residents put up a tacky lighting display on the front of their houses...or suffer the consequences! (I would sure hate to be a Jewish person living on this street). When Luther and Nora make the fatal mistake of foregoing Christmas (their daughter has joined the Peace Corps and won't be home for the holidays), all hell breaks loose in the community, with all the resident goons attempting to strong arm and browbeat the benighted couple into submission. Where's good old Scrooge when you need him? Watching ""Christmas With the Kranks"" is like finding a lump of coal in your stocking on Christmas morning; it makes you wonder what bad thing you did to deserve it. Instead of love and good cheer, we're treated to a witless holiday farce replete with labored slapstick and fake snow. All these neighborhood buttinskis are so annoying and irritating that they make you want to scream ""Get a life!"" every time they commit another holiday-related atrocity. Actually, given a more courageous set of filmmakers and a better script, ""Christmas With the Kranks"" might have been a slashing little satire on Christmas materialism (on the order of, say, a ""Bad Santa""); instead, it turns all feel-goody and mushy, converting the vicious neighbors into goody-two-shoe, Santa's Little Helper-types in time for the tear-soaked finale.Screenwriter Chris Columbus and director Joe Roth go for the lowbrow, easy laugh every time. Columbus even seems to be trying for a bit of that old ""Home Alone"" magic again by bringing in a couple of bumbling cops and a light-fingered jewel thief who burgles the upstairs bedrooms while a Christmas Eve party is in full swing below. Nothing works in this film, not the premise, not the humor, not the sentiment. The saddest thing is that the film wastes the talents of Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, M. Emmett Walsh, and Cheech Marin among others who probably signed on believing they were creating a Christmas classic that would live on through the ages. Instead, it joins all those other seasonal misfires like ""Santa Claus- The Movie,"" ""Jingle All the Way"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" Ah well, you can always serve this instead of a stuffed bird for Christmas dinner. At least this turkey is not fattening.",Christmas with the Kranks
22,thesar-2,Skip Skipping Christmas,1,5 December 2011,"Damn. Damn damn. 'Christmas with the Kranks' is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever, EVER seen. The book's title is 'Skipping Christmas' and I can see why they changed it: so no one had the bright idea of skipping this movie. In fact, the best line was one of the last ones spoken: ""Skipping Christmaswhat a stupid idea."" Yes. Yes, it was. The movie started bad, got progressively worse, and I stayed watching to see how much further down into hell they'd venture. I will say this that separates this from the rest: it has the absolute worst concept for a film. Mr. & Mrs. Krank want to skip Christmas to save money even though they claim it's not about money. They spend half the film denying the annoying neighbors the pleasure of butting into their business of why they won't spend 5 minutes putting up a Christmas light and the other half selling out in order to lie to their daughter. This movie is an absolute mess, has horrible morals, utterly unfunny and a train wreck with brilliant comedic stars that should know better. SKIP SKIPPING Christmas!!!",Christmas with the Kranks
23,Robert_duder,Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha!,7,16 December 2004,"There is nothing better than a great Christmas movie. Everyone can name their favorite and there is nothing more nostalgic than watching your favorite Christmas special every year. It remains to be seen whether The Kranks will become one of those for us, or for me anyways. Christmas With The Kranks which I was stunned to learn, the novel from which it was based, was penned by the amazing John Grisham and the screenplay by the equally amazing Chris Columbus was a fun, heart felt, and often laugh out funny Christmas film. It had it's shortcomings as the critics are shoving in our faces but a Christmas film must be given some slack for being a seasonal film anyways.The story is The Kranks, Luther and Nora have had to say goodbye to their beloved Daughter Blaire as she moves on to the Peace Corp. Suddenly their empty nest syndrome kicks in and they realize their whole reason for having extravagant Christmas's is gone. Luther realizes that this is the perfect opportunity to leave it all behind and take his wife on a luxurious cruise of the Caribbean but in order to truly appreciate the Christmas cruise they will have to boycott Christmas altogether which sounds easy at first but they realize their Christmas happy neighbors, co-workers and town are not going to stand for it. Everything comes to a grinding halt when Blaire calls to say she is coming home for Christmas which changes everything. Now all they've worked towards avoiding they have to bring back, set up, get ready for and prepare the best Christmas ever!! Tim Allen is wonderful in this movie, probably the best of the cast. The character fits him so well and he doesn't come across as Tim Taylor which is always good. Jamie Lee Curtis who I love don't get me wrong but she didn't quite hit the note on this one. She was okay but she wasn't well matched with Luther and she wasn't given the best of scenes in the film, although her bikini scene was very funny. Dan Akroyd makes an unfortunately brief appearance as the ""mayor"" of the neighborhood who at first appears to be hassling them but in the end rallies everyone to their support. The movie dragged a little, it's slightly longer than expected and the beginning of it was a little off putting. It felt like it was going to suck basically. But it got so much better half way through and ended perfectly. From the moment of the hilarious carolers outside their house, the movie was funny, heart warming, and fun to watch. The dialog felt forced at times and some of the gags did as well but it was still fun to watch. Throw in some necessary Christmas magic, and a little heart warming moment of Christmas realization and the film is wonderful. I can't wait to see it again next Christmas. I often wondered if Grisham or Columbus wasn't trying to be a little satirical at parts with the neighborhood perfectly aligned and snow perfectly placed. It felt like maybe they were poking a little fun but nonetheless it's a great family, Christmas movie. I also think they should have stuck with the title ""Skipping Christmas"" but that doesn't effect it much I suppose. Check it out!! 7.5/10",Christmas with the Kranks
24,MLDinTN,not that funny,3,28 March 2006,"This was a very boring, silly Disney comedy with one problem: It's not that funny. Maybe an 8 year old would like this, but it's definitely not for adults. From the first part of the film like when Luther is in the rain under than canopy, you know he's about to get soaked. So when it happens, it's no surprise. And the thought of a 50ish woman hiding because neighbors are chanting Free Frosty is so silly. And why they don't just tell their daughter they had a trip planned instead of telling her the party's on. No one could have gotten the party together and Christmas lights up in just a few hours. The only redeeming scene is Nora chasing the honey baked ham.FINAL VERDICT: Too childish, a waste of time.",Christmas with the Kranks
25,g-bodyl,A Feel-Good Holiday Movie!,8,12 October 2008,"I have no idea why people complain about this movie. I hear more complaints about this than the current President in office. I thought that this is a good film. The story is about a family whose daughter is leaving for the holidays apparently. The family played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen decides to go on a cruise on Christmas Day. As the day nears, the daughter calls back saying that she'll be home for Christmas. Now the family have to celebrate Christmas or else. This movie is not very funny, but it's funny enough that I'll chuckle here or there. Mostly, I was interested in the plot line. The acting is a bit cheesy but nothing totally bad. The soundtrack is average but I like to listen to Christmas songs. The screenplay by Harry Potter director Chris Columbus could have been written better. Overall, this is a good film designed to make you feel good.

26,ericstevenson,Too nice,2,16 December 2017,"I'm surprised that the score isn't a lot lower seeing as how frequently this appears on worst Christmas movies lists. I think this is mostly deserving of its hate. The thing with Tim Allen is that a lot of times you expect his movies to be forgettable, but he ends up making really good ones like ""Galaxy Quest"". This, on the other hand, is probably his worst movie. This movie's plot is that the Kranks are skipping Christmas and their neighbors harass them until they conform. That's the main problem.It would have been wonderful if the film had a scene where the neighbors realized that would they did was wrong. Instead, they never learn their lesson and it turns out they were right the whole time. Even the live-action Grinch movie delivered a better message against materialism! Santa Claus does in fact appear, but it's not revealed until the end of the movie. It ends with Santa riding a car led by reindeer. They couldn't even get Santa right.The characters in this are just dumb. There's a scene where a boy lets out a guy who's in the back of a police car! There's this giant Frosty house ornament that actually seems to come to live and wish destruction on the Kranks. It's just creepy. The message is that we shouldn't stop doing what we've been doing for the longest time. It's about how we shouldn't change and that's a terrible message any movie should send. *",Christmas with the Kranks

Easier said than done when their Xmas fascist neighbors (led by Dan Ackroyd) gang up on them and force the Kranks to conform to brainless consumerism.Man if that ain't the most important Xmas message ever committed to film then I just don't know what is. It's hard to believe Chris Columbus (a veteran at Xmas movies) produced a such a laugh-free 'comedy'. Only a couple of the gags work, which is half the reason I'm giving this 3 stars, but the cast just don't have any comic timing.The other reason I'm giving this a 3 instead of 2? Well, we're kind of shafted when it comes to Xmas movies this year.

34,southdavid,Happy Xmas (Film is over),2,10 December 2020,"Sigh. I try not to just be a grinch with Christmas films, but sometimes they really don't help themselves.With their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) away for the first Christmas since she was born, Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) decide to skip their festive period and instead plan to go on a cruise. Much to the annoyance of their neighbourhood they forgo decorating their house, their regular donations to charity and the Christmas parties. Then, unexpectedly on Christmas Eve, Blair decides to come home, so the pair desperately try to reinstate Christmas at short notice.I think I genuinely hated every moment of this tedious, witless, experience. The cast was pretty impressive, Dan Aykroyd, M Emmet Walsh, Felicity Huffman and Cheech Marin all appear but the performances aren't. Nobody except Allen and Curtis really do anything that awful (and there's some terrible slapstick foisted on both of them) - but by the same token its really bland, particularly when someone like Dan Aykroyd initially threatens to do something interesting with his character. The cast, however, is pretty much all the film had going for it. Despite being written by Jon Grisham, it's a tedious and disjointed story and one that only gets more and more preposterous and random as it runs on. It's quite badly made too, with the occasional moment of awful CGI and then there's one of the worst Christmas songs I've ever heard over the end credits.It's an odd movie message wise too. Generally, films have more of a ""Christmas is not about the superficial stuff"" theme, but here it appears to be more of a ""conform or you are worthless"" premise.

That's a reasonable, cool and frugal thing to do and I would like to root for you when all your cookie cutter neighbours try to make you feel bad for being a bit different.But then things go bad.

It's not that Mr Krank bizarrely baits the neighbours apparently on the principle of the thing (he says early on to everyone he's not doing it out of spite). It's not the lamely executed gags and vindictiveness of both the characters and the authors of this script.No, what makes this move so ugly is that it either a) has no idea what kind of message it wants or b) worse. It promotes conformism and excessive consumption and calls it ""community"" with the worst people paraded as heroes of the moment.And then it gets worse:Oh wait: your kid calls to say she's coming home after all? Why would she do that if you're on your cruise? What? You didn't tell her? Well she well be disapoint- wait, what?

I'm not a big fan of Holiday films, I often find them quite corny and ridiculous. This film isn't exactly an exception, but for the most part, I have to admit, I did enjoy it, and i'll tell you why. Tim Allen truly gives it his all in this film, as he often does in all his films and shows, and I just feel his character really fit his performance and although he was far from great, he was perfect for the role. I enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in a role like this, often very similar to my own grandmother, which I find kinda ironic. She is a bit over the top at times, and her character is written quite poorly, but she certainly doesn't way down the film in anyway. I enjoy the look of the film, as well as the atmosphere. It has some awful lines of dialogue throughout, really whoever wrote this films script, as well as directing it, really wasn't trying very hard. However, the actors are all up for the job, even in small parts, and it's sweeter spirit can get the best of you at times. It's beginning, or at least first half or so, can feel a bit ridiculous, just by peoples reactions and such, but if your willing to turn your brain off and just enjoy the film for what it is- a goofy sweet little xmas flick- than you are sure to have a good time.
My Rating: 6.5/10",Christmas with the Kranks
44,rbverhoef,A waste of time,3,30 November 2005,"What a terrible movie this is! 'Christmas with the Kranks' is a Christmas-comedy that is neither funny or about the spirit of Christmas. It is about a terrible neighborhood where Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) want to skip Christmas for a change to go on a cruise. Christmas has cost them six thousand dollars last year, mainly on decoration, so this year they don't do Christmas-stuff and go on the cruise, still saving three thousand dollars. Unfortunately their neighbors disagree. It is a tradition that the whole neighborhood takes part in this holiday; skipping is not an option. The ending of the film basically says that the neighbors are right and that their cruel methods to stop the Kranks from going on the cruise is justified. How stupid can it get?Well, even more than it already is. Of course the Kranks fail to skip Christmas because their daughter, only away for some weeks to join the Peace Corps in Peru, returns for the holidays together with her new fiancé. Right. So suddenly the Kranks have to do their usual Christmas-things that includes giving a Christmas Eve party. There is quite some hurry needed since the two lovebirds are already on their way. What do you know? All the cruel neighbors are willing to help! In a series of unfortunate events we see how things almost go wrong the entire time and turn out the way they should after all. How surprising.The movie rolls from one stupid event into another, never funny, most of the time even annoying. It is hard to believe this story seemed funny on paper and that gives us the obvious question of why this movie was even made. Probably because it is about Christmas and could make some money, which it did. If there is one Christmas-movie to avoid in whatever year it definitely is 'Christmas with the Kranks'.",Christmas with the Kranks
45,vertigo_14,Illogique. (spoilers),4,26 November 2005,"Christmas movies come en mass as though filmmakers are trying to score that one film turned holiday tradition. I don't know that it has successfully been done since the early 90s with the Home Alone movies (although by part 3, everyone pretty much lost interest). 'Christmas with the Kranks' joins a long line of these mediocre over-achievers.We once again join middle class white suburbanites for their Holiday woes and misadventures as the Krank spouses, played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, decide to opt out of Christmas this year. Their daughter heads off to Peru for the Peace Corps. and without her, the holiday just isn't the same. Resisting all holiday traditions from Christmas greetings to charitable donations, the Krank spouses decide they're going to just spend Christmas in the Caribbean on a cruise.But, in some kind of bizarre neighborhood which cannot seem to fathom someone not celebrating this particular holiday--Christmas--hinting of the absence of any religious or ethnic identities who follow other traditions, they just can't leave the Kranks alone. And the slapstick mayhem ensues as the neighbors, headed by the obnoxious leader (played by Dan Akroyd) taunts them about their decision. This kind of plot is immediately one of forced conflict and for the most part, is unbelievable because, one the one hand, the neighbors won't leave them alone (although this is another satirical poke at the obsessive suburban class), but because the Kranks seem to be very reluctant to stick firmly with their decision. Especially Mrs. Krank, who seems so helpless in the face of all the persistent resistance.But lo! It all turns around when the Krank daughter decides that she's going to come home for Christmas after-all, and the Krank parents, not wanting to disappoint her, have to ditch their anti-Christmas plans and hurry up and get everything together that they would've done had they not decided to boycott the holiday. And yada...yada...yada...it's chock full of family sentiment and slapstick comedy (although much of Tim Allen's subtleties are mildly amusing in this otherwise bland comedy).I wonder if this is one of those comedies produced out of the sudden irrational fear that there was an assault on Christmas. It was idiotic hoorah at the time and as a result, spawned a pretty boring movie. Even if influencing it in part. Oddly, this amazingly boring family film was based on a John Grisham novel.Your best bet for holiday-based humor is to stick with the classics.",Christmas with the Kranks
46,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Christmas with the Kranks (2004),4,14 December 2011,"This film had a strange effect on me. It was so excruciatingly bad that I turned into an absolute Grinch. Allen was so out of time with his comedic quips, that I had to replay his dialogue in my mind to be sure it was supposed to be a joke. The film has typical holiday mishaps. None of these amount to any classic moments. The first half misses out on doing some excellent parody, as the neighbours increase their creepiness. This would have been a great time to send-up some of the horror greats. Unfortunately, as much effort is put into this film, as the Kranks put into Christmas themselves. It's also hard to feel anything for characters used to giving $600 a year to charities. They are obviously financially well-off, so skipping Christmas doesn't seem like much of a sacrifice. The odd part comes at the very end. A moment of pure Christmas bliss, which is so touching my heart grew three times larger. It made me wonder if the film was supposed to be this bad, for the impact of these last scenes. The genuine concern and sorrow as Allen hears about his neighbour unable to walk across the street is rather moving. This film needed more moments such as this, rather than focusing on the mishaps of putting up decorations, and shopping around this time of year. Been there, done that.",Christmas with the Kranks
47,Kingslaay,Light hearted fun,7,1 October 2021,Christmas is a great time for joy and happiness and this film serves that purpose with some easy viewing. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are fun to watch and it has the odd dose of humour that lands well.,Christmas with the Kranks
48,Rob_Taylor,"Christmas in ""Xmas Geek Land""",5,27 March 2005,"or ""How to make a comedy movie starring Tim Allen and Dan Akroyd and have it NOT be remotely funny"" I think my dislike of this movie stems from its awful premise - that a couple might want to give Christmas a miss and end up being bullied by their neighbours into doing it anyway.This movie stinks! Are we to believe that people are so anal about the festive season that they'd go out of their way to make ""non-believers"" convert back to the their awful, over-hyped and commercialized version of it? Give me a break! Allowing for the fact of it being a comedy doesn't excuse the ludicrous way we are expected to believe people act where Christmas is concerned. None of the characters give remotely plausible performances as ""normal"" people. Instead we are treated to some writer's ridiculous vision of how Christmas should be and how people should behave at that time of year. Sadly, given the otherwise excellent cast, this fact causes the film to fall flat on its face. Instead of laughing at the antics of Tim Allen and Jamie Curtis to escape for the holidays, we are scowling at the absurd behaviour of every single one of their neighbours and their zombie-like ""must celebrate Christmas"" mentality. As a result, the gentle humour evident in the story is completely overwhelmed by this nonsense and only the strongest of visual gags gets a guffaw.And what is with Tim Allen and Christmas movies anyway? Give 'em up guy! You've done your quota! Move on. To think that this man gave us Galaxy Quest and has now sunk to this level. Someone check him into ""Christmas Movie Actors Anonymous"" before its too late! Much like the Christmas season itself, this movie seems to go on and on and you're relieved when its finally all over.But you know what the real horror of this movie is? The fact that, in a couple of years, the networks will start trotting it out ad nauseum every single Xmas season on TV. The horror....The only level that this movie does succeed on is that it really makes you want to forget about Christmas and never celebrate it again. Ever. Bah humbug! Summary: Not funny, very annoying, highly unbelievable. Characters you want to punch the Christmas spirit right out of. Avoid it like the rush hour traffic.",Christmas with the Kranks
49,Matt_Layden,"""It's Time For Tim Allen To Move Away From The Holiday Films.""",2,14 March 2006,"After their daughter leaves for the Peace Corps, Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip Christmas all together. No decorations, no gifts, no parties and no holiday spirit. Instead they decide to ""save"" money by taking a cruise...this does not settle very well with their neighborhood.Christmas With The Kranks seems like the perfect movie to start up a new series, Griswold style. With two comedy powerhouses in the starring roles, Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, and with Christpher Columbus penning the script, Kranks had potential to last longer then just one film. But Joe Roth makes the film so utterly boring and unbelievably unfunny, that instead of dreading any sequel in the works you dread the entire experience that you just went through watching this thickheaded attempt at a funny film.Where does the torture begin? Well, if I had to pinpoint the moment it started when the opening credits hit the screen. The bottom line is that Kranks is simply not funny at all. In what is suppose to be a family holiday comedy, Kranks is nothing more then a dim-witted, inane, atrocious piece of crap. Tim Allen should honestly stay away from anything Christmas related for the rest of his career, or sooner or later the Toolman's career will be over.Jaimie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen do not work very well together as a husband and wife. There was no real chemistry and neither of them manage to get any laughter out of the audience at any point in the film. Being scared of your neighbors to the point where you are scared to leave the house is not funny. Getting botox to the face and not being able to drink is not funny. Maybe is Allen and Curtis had better material to extract any piece of comedy from then this film would be one level above abominable.As well as not being funny Kranks is predictable. Scrooge finds a heart. That scrooge is Allen and the heart comes from giving away his cruise to an old man across the street, with whom he does not even like. After the Kranks decide to throw a Christmas party after all, all the neighbors join in and everyone lives happily ever after, except those that had to sit through this thing. There's not one interesting character in the whole film, not even one of the Christmas Crazed neighbors is able to connect or get any part of enjoyment from. Akroyd seemed okay in the role he did, but that doesn't make the role funny.Joe Roth has yet to make one entertaining film and after this and Freedomland, I predict he never will. He should stick to producing and let someone with a little bit more talent stay behind the camera. Roth had no clue how to direct with the talent that he had. If he had lead the cast in some kind of direction maybe the film would have had a stronger comedic tone. With not a funny joke or scene in the entire film, or even a story-line to keep the audience from leaving their seats to slit their wrists, Kranks manages to make it to the bottom of the heap in a list of bad movies.Everybody involved with this thing should have known that it was going nowhere. It's main draw in was the star power and everyone involved should read Comedy For Dummies, so the next time a garbage script like this comes their way, they are able to burn it.",Christmas with the Kranks
50,FlushingCaps,Laughs and sentiment=wonderful Christmas movie,8,14 December 2020,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie several times together. I just saw it again in 2020 and thought it high time to review it. I happened to see on IMDB that Roger Ebert gave it 1 star only, out of 4 as his rating, saying he thought the Kranks actions were all logical and the neighbors were terrible for forcing him to comply. He adds that ""the movie is not funny, ever, in any way...""Well, I am one of millions of people who disagree with the famous critic on this one. Actually, I tend to disagree with Mr. Ebert-even though I liked him on his TV series-about 85% of the time. I have watched movies he raves about and found them dreadfully dull. I have loved some movies that he totally disliked-including this one.Christmas with the Kranks is taken from the John Grisham novel, Skipping Christmas. I write this a month after seeing the movie, again, having just finished reading the novel for the first time. It is surprising how closely the movie follows the novel. Names of characters and events are mostly the same. There are a few scenes added to the movie-many of the funnier ones-and, of course, some that didn't make the film that were in the novel. The novel, while lighthearted, didn't seem nearly as funny to me as the movie.As to the movie, it begins with Luther and Nora Krank taking their adult daughter, Blair, to the airport on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, as she leaves for a two-year stint in the Peace Corps, in Peru. On the way home, they stop for a couple of items at a specialty grocer that Nora likes, but because it is raining hard and cold, Luther insists on being gallant and going out through the miserable weather to get the items. He steps in a pothole and gets cold water all over his socks and shoes.As he is entering the store, a man outside tries to sell him an umbrella, insisting he could really use one, but he politely resists. In a hint of the holiday mayhem to come, he can only get one of the two items his wife wanted, because he didn't know to ask the butcher for a certain kind of candy. Nora tells him how useless he is because everyone knows to ask the butcher for that.The story: Luther and Nora Krank are saying good-bye to their adult daughter, Blair, joining the Peace Corps the Sunday after Thanksgiving, taking her to the airport from their suburban Chicago home.The couple are concerned that Christmas, their first without Blair in 23 years will be quite sad because it'll be so different. Luther gets an idea and after spending much of his working day at the office figuring out money matters comes up with an idea.He presents it to his wife that night, and I don't know how anyone who hated various elements of this movie could not at least say this scene was funny. Luther is somewhat quiet, we figure, trying to figure out when to present his idea to Nora. Finally, he says he doesn't want any more pasta, that he has something special to show her. He dashes off and she starts thinking he wants a little dining room romance. She starts unbuttoning her vest and giggling waiting for him to return. He does with a portable stereo in a Hawaiian shirt and as she turns to unbutton some clothing, he plops out his ledger showing how much they spent on Christmas last year-over $6,100, which includes a huge party on Christmas Eve for all their neighbors and friends. This was a rather funny scene and is one that was not written in the novel in this manner. He did show her the spreadsheet in the book, but there was no thought of romance by Nora.She asks where he's leading, and he tells her about a cruise they can take-departing on Christmas afternoon. ""What's the catch?"" Nora asks. She is told the cruise will take over $3,000 so they can do it if they skip Christmas altogether. Now she does get him to agree to give to two important charities, a total of $600, like last year, but otherwise, the idea is, to skip all elements of Christmas, lest they wind up spending too much and not save anything.One thing that does make sense is not having their big party Christmas Eve, since it's a major expense, AND it would be hard to be ready to leave for a cruise the next day after being totally focused on the party up until hours before they leave.My biggest complaint is that they could have done the inexpensive, or free Christmas events and just cut out the expensive ones. Luther had the feeling that they would not be able to do only a little, thus it was necessary to ""skip"" the holiday altogether.The Kranks live in a neighborhood that has everyone together putting up a giant Frosty the Snowman figure on their roof. In the novel, it is explained how they all agreed to do this so their street would win an award from their community. The film doesn't really explain it, so it seems weird to see the same 7-foot figure tied to the chimney atop everyone's house-everyone except the Kranks because they wanted to totally skip Christmas this year.The novel does a better job of explaining the parts of Christmas the Kranks don't really like-Nora isn't fond of endless Christmas cards, for example, or having to work so hard on the Christmas party for dozens of people when Luther does so little to help. Luther isn't big on the endless decorating competitions and the endless bills for everything. One of the first things he cuts off is his annual donation to the Police Benevolent Association through the purchase of a calendar. The two policemen who are rebuffed are stunned.The neighbors are shown as being quite pushy, and it is this that makes Luther want to go against everything, even refusing to let them put up the Frosty figure when they offer to do so. Much criticism I have read focuses on the question of ""Why didn't Luther just do the non-costly things, like letting the neighbors put up the Frosty instead of seeming so hostile?"" I concede that the movie didn't really explain this as well as the book and is a weak point in the film.Luther ""snubs"" the boy scouts selling Christmas trees. Here I thought he should have just counted it as a charity and paid for a tree, telling them to just accept the donation. He also keeps stepping on the white cat that belongs to their older neighbors across the street. The neighbors, Walt and Bev are clearly friends, even though Walt loves to call the much younger Luther ""Old Man."" Bev is fighting cancer, again.Nora is troubled by neighbors coming over while Luther's at work, wanting her to let them put up the Krank's Frosty, so their neighborhood might win the contest again this year. Luther tells her to sneak out and meet him at the mall. There he shows her some skimpy bathing suits and leads her to a tanning salon, where they are going to get tanned in time for their cruise.Christmas is upon us and with the trip just one day away, the couple get a phone call from their daughter-she's at the airport in Miami, calling to tell them how her plans have changed. She's coming home that night, and will be there in time for their ""famous"" Christmas Eve party. And she's bringing her boyfriend, who wants to marry her. Now he is never called her fiancé, which seems like the proper word.Suddenly the trip is off, according to Nora, and they have to arrange the party for that night. For a while, the only person Nora can get to come is a friendly old guy at the store who seems to know her and Blair, even though she has no clue who he is. Luther, after buying a tree that makes Charlie Brown's look good in comparison, arranges to borrow a tree from a neighbor couple who are driving away for a few days to visit relatives. The cops are alerted to the apparent burglary, and only because the neighbor kid Spike backs up Luther's story does he avoid going downtown. The scenes where Luther and Spike are trying to move the tree across the street and down to his house were very funny to me.The leader of the neighborhood is Spike's father Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd, who does a great job of making him be a busy body, yet he treats everyone very nicely, even though he doesn't understand why Luther won't have anything to do with the usual Christmas festivities. But when he hears that Blair is coming home, he gathers everyone and leads them to do all they can to help the Kranks put on their party, even though Luther has upset them for the past few weeks.Many of the funniest scenes are as they are hastily putting together the party, including a police escort for Blair and boyfriend, that includes picking up a burglar in the process.
To me the weakest part of the whole movie was Nora's attempt to buy a special canned ham that her daughter loves. At the market, she finds herself sort-of racing down the aisle beside an old lady with a shopping cart, not truly knowing if the other lady is going for the same ""last can"" that Nora is. Nora would have beaten her if she had not kept turning to see where the lady was beside/behind her, as she runs into someone, and loses out. She finds another, expensive"" way to get her ham.Then she's depicted swinging the heavy can in a plastic bag while walking through the parking lot. Of course the bag breaks and she loses the ham-more stupidity on her part. Those bags will hold a heavy object, but swinging them frequently leads to them breaking, as any grocery shopper knows well.To me, the message of the movie is the wonderful spirit of Christmas displayed by the neighbors to help the Kranks, even though the Kranks had been very frustrating to them for several weeks. There's also some real spirit shown by Luther toward neighbors that I won't reveal in case someone reading this has never seen this movie.It wasn't the funniest Christmas movie of all time, but it does rank pretty high-much funnier than The Christmas Story or other famous ones. I also think it was much funnier than Grisham's novel Skipping Christmas. This merits an 8 out of 10 score from me.",Christmas with the Kranks
51,dunmore_ego,Dreaming of a Fight Christmas.,1,5 January 2010,"Christmas WITH THE KRANKS is about selfishness, viciousness, hypocrisy and homogeneity - you know, the true spirit of Christmas.From a John Grisham novel, Skipping Christmas (which I presume is as compelling as his other books - and therefore nowhere near as asinine as this movie), KRANKS is about middle-aged upper-class couple Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) who decide to ""skip Christmas"" when their beloved daughter leaves for overseas.But the neighbors won't let them, cursing, terrorizing, belittling and ostracizing them from the community until the Kranks yield to communal pressure; until they step in line with the prescribed collective psychosis.You see, the Kranks are hooked into traditions of donating to many town charities, purchasing Christmas goods from the town vendors, throwing the best parties - in other words, other people's fun and profit depends on them staying in town and paying their dues.Rewritten for the screen in a blind haze by Chris Columbus, directed by Joe Roth like he was distracted by Jamie Lee Curtis's bad hairstyle, Christmas WITH THE KRANKS is a fake-smile, mean-spirited, half-baked stinkfest.Dan Aykroyd is the town burgomaster, whose iron hand decrees the Kranks shall be terrorized for their omission: empowering kids to phone them incessantly in protest, hammering ""Free Frosty"" signs into the Kranks's lawn (next it will be a burning cross and no one will think twice), publicly humiliating Nora for not buying Christmas cards, terror-caroling, veiled threats and petty vengeful acts.In the true spirit of Christmas.Luther has bought tickets for a Caribbean cruise which leaves on Christmas day, but daughter phones and informs she is unexpectedly returning for Christ's mistaken birth date. So for the sake of daughter having a traditional Christmas (whatever that means) the Kranks decide to stay in town and have their vaunted party. Okay - but at what point did the filmmakers think that the decision to not tell daughter of their other plans was a funny one? The Kranks's recant now gives the townsfolk even more grist for their vengeance mill, as they extort Luther for every article he needs to make the ruse believable, making life as hard as possible for him.In the true spirit of Christmas.Nora goes shopping for a ham and ends up in a gladiatorial battle with an old lady for it.In the true spirit of Christmas.Comrade Aykroyd gathers the villagers together and tells them to help Luther make his party a success ""for the sake of daughter."" In other words, you can still hate the father - let's fake amity for his offspring. And organize a party (which they all wanted to attend anyway).In the midst of the ersatz party, Luther can't bring himself to speechify thanks to anyone. Can you blame him? Just yesterday they were vilifying him, now hypocritically pretending that nothing transpired. And Nora chides him, ""All those people out there sacrificed their night to make this party happen?""-- --sound of needle scratching across record---Those people ""sacrificed""? Sacrificed WHAT, exactly? She actually says, ""After all they've done, you couldn't drop in a 'thank you'""! ""All they've done"" is treat us like lepers for the past few days! But nothing has to make sense any more, as long as Nora toes the line with everyone else in the inculcation factory of mediocrity. And that's all that matters to Big Brother (aka Christ the Savior, Jesus the King, Santa the Doom Bringer, and Patsy the Hit-man Elf).Movie hints at one of the major reasons people would want to avoid Christmas - to save money - a message lost immediately as Nora twists the topic into hypocrisy again.Jamie Lee Curtis starred with Dan Aykroyd back in 1983's TRADING PLACES, when he was actually funny and she was as close to a '10' as a woman with a man-'do could possibly be. Here, she looks bloated and haggard - obviously before her Activia diet - with a hairstyle that I think is called Middle America Bowl.Can we please have a moratorium on ""rocking up"" Christmas songs. It's the Polishing A Turd syndrome: no matter how interestingly you arrange Mustang Sally - it's still Mustang Sally. Playing Christmas carols with drums and electric guitars doesn't disguise that they're stupid Christmas carols. In fact, they sound stupider.Luther gives his precious Caribbean tickets to the grumpy old codger (M. Emmet Walsh) - one of his biggest detractors. Doesn't the fact that Grumpy accepts the tickets not only mean he is a hypocrite, but that he is also an insurrectionist deserving of vitriol from the community now?Now you're vilifying ME for pointing out these discrepancies and inconsistencies and hypocrisies in this ""fun-filled family romp""; your hatred swells your Balrog glands and washes through the internet's series of tubes, only to ebb like icy vituperation onto my keyboard like liquid nitrogen at an Alice Cooper concert. You wish you could defile my lawn; you wish you could overcharge me for a Christmas tree; you wish you could beat me to death over a canned ham. Be proud of yourselves. You're behaving-- In the true spirit of Christmas.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Christmas with the Kranks
52,Sirus_the_Virus,Corny.,5,12 September 2009,"Christmas with the Kranks is such a corny movie that I have to roll my eyes repeatedly every time I see it. The film isn't a total loss but is it a smash?No. Christmas with the Kranks is a ridiculous comedy about The Kranks, a couple who's daughter has left for the Peace corp. The Kranks are spending way too much damn money on Christmas, so they decide to skip Christmas. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis play the Kranks. Anyways, once everyone hears about this fiasco, everyone gets up in their face about it. The Kranks live in an imaginary type town where Christmas matters a lot. So they are harassed a ton by the neighbors, but the one it shocks the most is Roy Fromeigher(It's a good guess)(Dan Akroyd). Once the Kranks learn that their daughter is coming home for Christmas, everyone makes a big deal about it. Really, everyone acts like this girl has been kidnapped and is reuniting with her parents for the first time in years. It's only been a month people, cry me a river.I give Christmas with a Kranks a thumbs down because it just seemed too... I don't know. There are many bad things about this movie. It's not a total wreck. Allen and Curtis do a good job and I laughed a couple of times. But most of the film seems a bit too silly and cheesy. Some of the film doesn't really seem that chipper either. I don't think giving a woman with cancer a cruise is a good idea. I didn't hate Christmas with the Kranks, but it could've been a hell of a lot funnier. The idea sounds funny, but the film isn't a bust a gut. It's an okay family comedy. I still give it a thumbs down, but the film isn't a total disaster. Perhaps I am being too kind on this film, but that is because I am a kind person, most of the time.

54,Beta_Gallinger,Another unfunny film starring Tim Allen,5,27 July 2008,"I recall seeing the theatrical trailer for this Christmas movie, so I've been familiar with the title, ""Christmas with the Kranks"", for several years. Before seeing it, I knew it wasn't very popular, and didn't remember anything funny from the trailer (though I don't think I remembered much from the trailer, other than a clip showing Tim Allen's face frozen). I enjoyed ""The Santa Clause"" (an earlier Christmas movie starring Allen) as a kid, but the last time I watched it, which was just last December, I no longer cared much for it. So, it was no surprise that after finally seeing this less popular movie nearly four years after its release, it wasn't too satisfying.Blair Krank is a member of the Peace Corps and will soon be leaving for Peru, so it seems her parents, Luther and Nora Krank, won't be seeing her for a while. Soon after her departure, Luther comes up with an idea. This idea is for the Kranks to skip Christmas this year, which will save them a lot of money, and the couple will be able to go on a Caribbean cruise on December 25 instead. With some effort, he manages get Nora to agree to boycott Christmas this year and go on the Caribbean cruise with him. However, facing the holiday season without participating turns out to be rather difficult, with the neighbourhood constantly trying to make them change their minds, pressuring them to bring their Frosty outside and caroling outside their house! It gets worse when they receive a call from their daughter on Christmas Eve and she tells them she is coming home for Christmas! She will be arriving that night, so her parents now must try as hard as they can to set up the house for Christmas within the last hours before her arrival! As a comedy, I can't think of any memorably terrible gags, but overall, there aren't too many words I can think of to describe the humour in the film other than mediocre and forgettable. I couldn't keep a straight face the entire time, I have to admit that some parts made me smile, the first one being where water comes pouring down from the roof outside the store on Luther while a man in a Santa suit is offering him an umbrella. However, when it comes to humour, there's nothing classic in this film. One of the things that's supposed to be funny is the bad luck Nora (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) tends to have while the Kranks avoid Christmas, and how she reacts, but I didn't find it too amusing, and I don't think I explain why (if it was appalling, I'm sure I would be able to, but it's simply so-so). As for Tim Allen in the role of Luther, well, of all the live action movies starring Allen I've seen in the past couple years, the only above average one was ""Galaxy Quest"", in my opinion. In ""Christmas with the Kranks"", as usual, he doesn't play the most considerate, caring individual, and as usual, he's not that funny. None of the characters in the film are notably likable.Like probably many movies I've seen, ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is an adaptation of a book I haven't read. The book is called ""Skipping Christmas"", by John Grisham. So, I don't know how the book is in comparison, but regardless, this is another lacklustre family Christmas movie. I might be able to say there are some mildly touching moments towards the end, but that doesn't make the movie worth it, and looking back after watching it, none of those scenes really mean that much to me. I'm sure I could watch superior Christmas movies with equally or more touching moments. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the humour should have been a major priority, but there aren't many laughs, if any, so I'm going to have to give ""Christmas with the Kranks"" a thumbs down.",Christmas with the Kranks
55,vip_ebriega,"No! Ho! Ho! ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is not that terrible, but not that good either",4,24 April 2007,"My Take: A few laughs and that's about it.I enjoy watching holiday-themed movies, mostly not during the holidays, because it reminds me of the joy. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was bashed (both by critics and the public) when it was released. It was silly; a big mess with scattershot characters and a silly plot. Although it has a few laughs, it never really picks up steam.Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are occasionally funny, but burdened by humor they're too smart to be doing. There was some truly messy things, like the ""Free Frosty"" subplot which rarely makes sense (and managed to make Dan Aykroyd into a total jerk). Still, director Joe Roth may not be as successful as director Chris Colombus when he directed the two ""Home Alone"" films, but he does give some rather fine bits to the film.

56,adamscastlevania2,A fair reason to change religion,2,23 December 2014,"(11%) Yet another star-studded, well sort of, Christmas movie that likely paid off more than a couple of turkey dinners. The plot could have possibly worked here, maybe as an antidote to the typical sickly glut of good cheer Hollywood nonsense, but if anything this overall works out even worse than if it were plain sugar syrup. The concept of a couple bypassing Christmas completely is easily interpreted as being somewhat mean spirited, because after all what is Christmas all about? Well according to this movie it's spending vast amounts of cash ($6000+ on a single day, really?), and eating heavily processed pork products. The more broken aspect of the movie though is once the couple start to reject the season everyone around them makes such a big fuss about it. Why do they care so much? What's it got to do with them anyway? But of course the couple then at the last minute have a change of heart and delve right into rampant consumerism, and conformity is fully resumed. Dan Aykroyd is hardly in the film, Curtis is really annoying at times, and Allen has always been a very hard man to like. Overall not utterly dire, but third rate all the same.",Christmas with the Kranks
57,krorie,The first half of the movie is much better than the second half,5,1 January 2006,"The first part of this movie is filled with dark humor and makes a worthwhile statement: Most of those who celebrate Christmas do so because of the trappings, not because of the substance. The huge snowman that each family who lives on the block is supposed to inflate and put atop their house points to the frivolity of the holiday for the average observer. I haven't read John Grisham's book ""Skipping Christmas"" yet but the first half of the film seems to be pure Grisham. Luther Krank (Tim Allen) is something of an antihero declaring his own private little war on Christmas abuse, unlike Dickens' Scrooge who simply doesn't want to be bothered with the holiday because he's a miser and worships money. Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) on the other hand really wants the show of Christmas to impress the neighbors and not to rock the boat. Having her only child Blair Krank (Julie Gonzalo) away from home at Christmas for the first time kills her holiday spirit anyway. She is pictured as a doting mom who has spoiled her child rotten at the expense of her marriage and anything else not involving Blair. The second half of the film becomes a standard traditional type outing with Luther Krank being the scrooge-like selfish oaf who wants to spoil it all with his bah, humbug attitude. He comes around by giving the best gift of all to his neighbor whose wife is dying of cancer. In other words, the film cops out during the second half and with it the humor sours. A potentially funny holiday treat becomes just another lame copy of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""There are some truly funny sequences during the first part of the movie. Note when Luther Krank waters down his sidewalk to make it slippery for the terrible carolers. Keep your eye on the neighbor's cat. The botox part is excruciatingly laughable with Tim Allen at his best. The tanning scene with the glorious Tom Poston as the Krank's priest is also hilarious. Too bad this level of humor was not maintained throughout.The cast is well chosen with one exception. Cheech Marin is wasted in a thankless role.

They do an about-face and try to get their house in order for her imminent arrival. Everything that could go wrong does, and it is up to their neighbors -- most of whom Mr. Krank is not exactly on speaking terms with -- to save the day. I've seen worse, but I don't know when. Curtis is completely out of her element here. An awkward bit depicting her mad rush to buy a canned ham and get it safely home has to be about the lowest point in her career. The ending is so similar to the equally bad DECK THE HALLS, you have to wonder. Both borrow heavily from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and THE KRANKS additionally borrows from the end of HOME ALONE 2, but does so very badly. As we all know, Allen has no shame, as the movie is just one more notch in his by-now very tired tool belt (Have you seen THE SANTA CLAUSE 3?).",Christmas with the Kranks
64,movieguy1021,Christmas with the Kranks: 5/10,5,29 November 2004,"Have you ever heard of Ben Affleck? I'm sure you have, but if I ask you the same thing next year, I'm sure you won't know who I'm talking about. It's primarily from his October release Surviving Christmas, which grossed about as much as the latest Uwe Boll movie. That flop is the reason why Christmas with the Kranks is so awkwardly titled. Instead of Skipping Christmas, like the John Grisham book on which the movie is based, the law, or MPAA (what's the difference?), or someone, made Revolution Studios change the name. Directed by Revolution bigwig Joe Roth, it's a movie that Sony thinks is necessary for post-9/11: how the spirit of Christmas can cure even the most insane of individuals. The Christmas portrayed here isn't even close to the Christmas displayed so beautifully in The Polar Express. This is the annoying ""ho-ho-ho Santas on every roof"" type of Christmas that everyone despises so. Therefore, it's hard to get a palpable feeling out of Kranks. But, it could have been worse. I could have been watching Surviving Christmas.Luther and Nora Krank (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) have just become empty nesters in their northern American town (at least I think so-everyone seemed to have a ""Minnesota Nice"" accent). Their Christmas-obsessed town has not only depleted their wallets, but also, finally, their spirits. The Kranks decide to skip Christmas and take a Caribbean cruise instead. This upsets the town, especially Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd), the so-called ringleader of the street for its annual Christmas contest. Then, about halfway through the movie, something ""surprising"" (i.e. shown in the trailer) happens which causes a reversal of the skipping of Christmas. Will the Kranks be able to pull it off?Roth (having directed such other gems like America's Sweethearts and Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise) is quite possibly the worst director in the history of film-making. Not only could he find a director to do this (so he had to resort to it himself), but the way he changed focus-he must have done it a dozen time. What he did was let the focus go from one character to something else for a few second, then slip back. He tries to do it on the sly, but fails miserably. It's almost condescending to the audience, like we can't figure out what in the shot is important for us to look at. He, obviously knowing what to expect from the results, doesn't seem to really care about the movie. Instead of trying to make the movie realistic, all of the sets are obviously Hollywood backlots. I suppose that the town's supposed to be Anywhere, USA, but that doesn't mean it has to look like every other town in films.Chris Columbus, writer of the script, is known for writing (and/or directing) overlong movies with sappy endings. Kranks satisfies one of the two, and with a 94 minute runtime, you can guess which. The Kranks are such crazy characters (as evidenced by their names, too) who go on such crazy adventures (or as crazy as they can be for PG), that they suddenly become sane because of The Christmas Spirit. It's that type of baloney Christmas sentimentality that really bugs me about many movies. But on a completely different note, the movie did have its moments (especially during its ""raunchier"" moments), but the thing was that it was constantly entertaining. I never felt bored, or really upset by it (until, of course, the last ten minutes or so, when it went all Hallmark on me). The movie did have a bit of satirical wit through it, although not as sharp as it could be or wanted to be. But still, it's kind of remarkable for satire in a PG movie.Both Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis annoy me. Allen did annoy me here in Kranks, but for some reason, I really liked Curtis's over-the-top performance. After her fluke success in 2003's Freaky Friday, I suppose she isn't really struggling for work (unlike Allen), and can have more fun with these kinds of roles. Aykroyd (when's the last time he's had a 'real' role?) does what he needs to do, but, seriously, get this guy better roles! He's better than this! The movie could also do better than it did, but it's a diverting diversion, nothing more.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for brief language and suggestive content.",Christmas with the Kranks
65,baileycrawly,"Well, I Liked It",9,4 December 2019,"This movie isn't something that will ever be cited as having changed the face of cinema, but it's not trying to. All this movie is trying to do is give you a bit of a laugh and much-needed dose of the holiday spirit.
The reactions of the townspeople when they find out the Kranks are skipping Christmas are over-exaggerated, but that's what makes it funny. The fact that such a tight-knit community (on the surface) would have a cult-like leader dictating their actions is every bit a social commentary as it is an entertaining comedic subplot.
This movie is funny. It's got a lot of holiday spirit in it. It's a joy to watch.
Plot-wise, it's not perfect. It's a faithful adaptation of John Grisham's novel, ""Skipping Christmas,"" which was just like the movie: funny but flawed.
It's just not Christmas without some of the scenes in this movie, and it hasn't failed to serve up the laughs year after year for me. So, maybe it's that veil of nostalgia and tradition that I'm forced to look through because I can't see it any other way, but I really love this movie.

66,RiffRaffMcKinley,Pointless and Irritating Fare,1,23 September 2007,"The story of ""Christmas with the Kranks"" has to be one of the most sinfully moronic in history, but then director Joe Roth had to go and dumb it down even more by hiring great (but here very bored and uninteresting) actors and not doing his job by them.What infuriates me most about this film is, of course, the story. The Kranks had plans because their daughter wasn't coming home for Christmas. But then, on the spur of the moment, she decided to do so after all, so they scramble to impress her? I don't *think* so! I'd be saying, ""Sorry, you brat, we're on vacation!""Tim Allen gives his most unbearable performance ever, as does Jamie Lee Curtis, and as does Dan Aykroyd.

67,TheHonestCritic,"A holiday train wreck? Or, a holiday classic?",10,31 January 2021,"""Christmas with the Kranks"" (2004), I remember going to watch this movie in the theater. As I watched it, I was invested and laughing from beginning to end. Then, I just watched it recently and it still holds up today. This film is so good, that it has actually found a place on my top 10 all-time favorite Christmas movies list. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is based on the novel, ""Skipping Christmas"", by John Grisham. I have read some of the book, but not all of it. What I have read so far is very good, and this film is a great adaptation of it first glance, the plot may surprise the average person, especially if they enjoy celebrating Christmas, like me. I will admit, when I first saw the trailer and story, I was kind of shocked. The plot is, the Krank family's daughter, Blair leaves home to join the Peace Corps. With Luther and Nora Krank home alone for the holidays, Luther suggests that they go on a cruise and skip Christmas altogether. That infuriates their fellow neighbors and then from there, it's non-stop comedy and shenanigans. Then, a shocking twist comes when Blair changes her mind and comes home for Christmas. It's every bit as funny and over the top as it sounds. All of the jokes hit bullseye and it also has a heartwarming subplot and ending that I won't spoil in case you haven't seen the movie yet. All of the acting is stellar from all of the actors and actresses. Tim Allen is hilarious as Luther Krank, Jamie Lee Curtis is funny as Nora Krank, Dan Aykroyd is fantastic as Vic Frohmeyer, etc. The cast is amazing, you got: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dan Aykroyd, Julie Gonzalo and more. What a lineup! They all do a flawless job with their respectable characters. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give this film a very beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are outstanding. They do get a little cheesy at times, but overall, the special effects still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Debney is perfect and the film score definitely sets the tone for the movie. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a holiday classic, in my opinion. I enjoy it every time I watch it and I laugh just as hard, if not harder each time I see it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. To all of the common people out there who hate this movie, take a good look at yourselves and re-think your lives. It's time you grew a spine and developed a sense of humor!

68,freakfire-1,Tim Allen likes him some Jamie Lee Curtis...,4,8 October 2008,"Jamie Lee Curtis, the woman known for her curves in ""Halloween"" and ""True Lies"", is combined with 'Tool Time' Tim Allen for a Christmas movie. I guess that answers the question: ""Can Tim Allen get the same women Arnold Schwarzenegger can get?"". Unfortuneatly, yes he can. Although I wouldn't want Mr. Allen to run for political office.What we have is, for the most part, an average Christmas movie with the main protagonist not wanting to join the festivities. Instead, with JLC, he plans a Caribbean vacation. And while it works for the most part, it all unravels when his daughter decides to come home for X-Mas unexpectedly.It sure does take a long time for the film to get going. Seriously, over an hour of the film is about Allen and Curtis avoiding Christmas. And while there were some kind of crazy moments, nothing that was really funny. The only time it was kind of funny was when Tim Allen And Jamie Lee Curtis go to the tanning salon and wear skimpy bikini outfits.So many things could have been funny. We could have had Allen and Curtis just hating Christmas, much like Bill Murray did in ""Groundhog's Day"". Instead, we are left to ponder. Nobody goes insane. It is, for the most part, everybody lives happily ever after type at the end.Where is the comedy?

70,Pookyiscute,Right down there with 'Surviving Christmas',4,4 January 2006,"I saw a few previews for this last Christmas, and thought that it looked hilarious, and although I'd heard dismal reviews over it, I gave it a chance, since not only had I heard that the book was excellent, and that it was written by none other than John Grishman, but because sometimes, the reviewers and I don't always see eye to eye.So, I gave it a try. I am so sorry I did. This movie was so bad, that it was hard to watch. I only stuck with it to the end, because not only was I really bored, but because I enjoyed the characters, too. Jammie Lee Curtis was excellent in this, and portrayed the role of a tired, older, unattractive housewife to the T. Tim Allen, was also good in this, but I feel that he's been a bit type casted in movies ever since 'The Santa Clause'. He seems to be doing a lot of Christmas movies lately ever since then, and in fact starring in reprisals of the movie, twice. Dan Akroyd, must be looking for work these days, and it's actually a bit sad when you think he was nominated for an Academy Award once, and now he's making a stupid slap-stick comedy that made Dumb & Dumberer look intelligent. But, the few things that I will give the film credit for are these: 1. It had a good heart-felt message towards the end of the picture 2. There were a few funny moments, that will genuinely make you laugh aloud 3. The film was very character driven, and that's what had most of its appeal and finally, 4. It is extremely clean. So, it's good for watching with the whole family during the holidays. However, with this being said, if you're looking for a family tradition, like 'Christmas Vacation', this is not the place to look. And, most of what went on, was so totally unrealistic, that its hard to watch at times, because its almost to the point of frustrating, and irritating. However, because of the fine job Curtis and Allen did in the film, I'm willing to overlook some of the films faults, and give it a full 4. But, like I said, 'Surviving Christmas' is just a small notch below this, and I wouldn't be surprised, if from that film, they got some of this one's plots.",Christmas with the Kranks
71,D_Burke,"When It Didn't Try So Hard To Be Slapstick, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" Worked Best",5,12 January 2011,"The first problem with ""Christmas With The Kranks"" is its title. Would you want to spend a holiday with a family named Krank? I wouldn't.The film should have been called, ""Skipping Christmas"", as it is an adaptation of the John Grisham novel of that name. The name was actually changed so as not to confuse it with ""Surviving Christmas"" (2004), which came out around the same time. Whereas ""Surviving Christmas"" was as disposable as the wrapping paper of an unwrapped gift, ""Christmas With The Kranks"" was slightly more memorable only when it didn't try so hard to be funny.I will say that I am a sucker for the sugar-coated Christmas specials of my youth, such as Rankin-Bass' ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (1964) and ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"" (1976). That said, such cynical holiday movies as ""The Ref"" (1994) and ""Bad Santa"" (2003) are hilarious because they are so uncompromising and have a lot of freedom in their comedy. The problem with ""Christmas With The Kranks"" is that it tries to be cynical and heartfelt simultaneously, and it just doesn't work.Tim Allen is Luther Krank, an accountant who, along with his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis), has just seen daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) board a plane to Peru where she would be doing social service as a Peace Corps volunteer. She won't be home for Christmas, which prompts Luther to plan a Caribbean Cruise in place of doing any holiday preparations. No Christmas tree, no lights and decorations, no gifts, and no guilt.The story has a good premise in showing how, while the holiday season, particularly Christmas, is a happy and exciting time of year, the preparation leading up to the major holidays can usually be exhausting. Unfortunately, Tim Allen gives a one-dimensional performance as a guy who wants to skip Christmas not to avoid the stress, but solely to save money. In fact, he doesn't even seem to miss his daughter as she flies away, as he remarks, ""You had to fly out the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the busiest travel day of the year."" If Luther Krank is a grumpy old man a la Archie Bunker, that's one thing, but Allen is not convincing enough in this movie to be frugal, grumpy, or even comic relief. It's not that he's monotone, but he just fails to convey any of these emotions, and it's all because his character is not as fleshed out.I actually liked Jamie Lee Curtis in her role. I especially liked how it's emphasized that her character shares more of the burden for skipping Christmas because women (let's face it) generally have a lot more obligatory holiday preparations than men do. When those preparations are put aside, there's bound to be a lot of guilt in its place. Curtis does well playing someone who is initially reluctant to skip Christmas, but shares more of the consequences for doing so.However, the consequences in this film seemed quite contrived, particularly the nosy neighbors led by Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd). The way these neighbors reacted to the Kranks' alternative holiday plans not only seemed completely rude and inconsiderate, but almost too over the top. The scene that tried way, way, way too hard to be funny was when Nora pulls her car out of her driveway, only to have Frohmeyer put his hands on her driver's side window and allow himself to be dragged alongside the car. I don't care what holiday you celebrate. If you have even one neighbor who harasses you to this extent because you don't put a snowman on your roof, it's time to move.That part and others make up a classic case of how this film, produced by ""Home Alone"" director Chris Columbus, was not sure whether it wanted to be a holiday classic for the whole family, or a parody of the holiday's excesses. ""Home Alone"" somehow succeeded in being both, mainly because writer John Hughes seemed to focus on making a good story with Christmas being a backdrop. His intent probably was not to parody Christmas as much as it was to make a coherent story with convincing characters, which he did. ""Christmas With The Kranks"" has neither elements, nor the overall charm to pull them off.This film has one touching moment in the end involving Walt Scheel (M. Emmet Walsh) and his wife Bev (Elizabeth Franz), who was recently diagnosed with cancer. I actually did shed a tear when Luther Krank visits them, because it was so well written and without the frivolities of the various minor characters and sitcom-like subplots. Once that scene was over, there were some more useless occurrences that tried and failed at comic effect, including a stranger who you later find out just might be (guess who) Santa Claus!John Grisham's novel on which this film was based was good, but not great. However, it was better than the film because it told a decent story without giving way to slapstick comic effects too much. Considering Grisham himself had no involvement in this script, my guess is that a number of producers took the script and said, ""Hey, let's have a Botox joke here."" and ""How about a burglar in this part?"". It bogs the movie down to mediocrity that will probably not make it a Christmas classic. It's just a good thing these producers weren't alive when ""It's A Wonderful Life"" came out, and they kept their hands off ""A Christmas Story"". Let's just hope they steer clear of future holiday movies too.",Christmas with the Kranks

I was really hoping that they would get to go on the holiday, but thanks to a horrible crop of bullying neighbours, a disgusting commercialised overtone and a spoilt brat of a daughter, it took the worse possible turn, became so unrealistic and became one of the worst Christmas messages that a show can give.Whatever the opposite of a 'Feelgood film' is, here it is.

75,RhapsodyReviews,"Not Bad, Not Great.",6,23 December 2019,"Review:
'Christmas with the Kranks' is a Christmas comedy film directed by Joe Roth. It is based on the novel 'Skipping Christmas' by John Grisham.
This movie pisses me off instead of putting me in the Christmas spirit. I'm personally on the Kranks side throughout this whole movie. If they don't want to celebrate Christmas one year, who cares. Get off their backs.
It stars Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis as a couple who decide to skip Christmas one year since their daughter is away, much to the chagrin of their neighbors.
Tim Allen seems to be carving out a career with these Christmas movies. Though his performance is not even close to his Santa character, he still manages to put in a performance that has some memorable moments. Jamie Lee Curtis acts as if she hasn't done a comedic role before and is too over the top.
There are some truly funny sequences during the first part of the movie. It's just not maintained throughout the rest of the movie. It becomes enraging and almost cartoonish at times.
Overall, it's a fun movie to watch with the family, but if you're looking for a Christmas movie to make you feel good and put you in the Christmas spirit, watch something else.

78,bob-rutzel,Almost a Disaster,4,9 November 2005,"The Kranks (Allen, Curtis) decide to skip Christmas since their daughter is going to Peru with the Peace Corps. They plan on a Caribbean cruise instead. Their neighbors and co-workers treat them like Mr. and Mrs Scrooge and just as they are about to leave, the daughter calls and says she is coming home for Christmas. OMG!I never have seen a movie where the first half was a total disaster and the second half, while not all that good, actually saves itself.barely. The first half was like an eight-year old getting a Brownie movie camera and deciding to make a movie. No, wait. That does a great injustice to the eight-year old, who I am sure would have made the first half of this movie a lot better. The first half was completely dumb. And, there was room for it to be great. John Grisham wrote the book Skipping Christmas, which is a far better title than what we have. I am sure Mr. Grisham is seeking his lawyers for his reputation being besmirched with this disaster. He didn't write the play-script and should have. Tim Allen knew this was bad and he played it straight as did Ms. Curtis. In fact everyone did okay acting-wise. It was the script itself that was bad. Yes, and the direction was bad too. This all turns around, somewhat, when the news of the daughter returning is announced. What helps this turn-around is guess what? The music. Christmas music has a way of not letting you see the bad things. You sing along and everyone is happy. Cheap shot, I say.Funny moments were few. Luther Krank making his front yard a virtual ice rink so the neighbors can't stand on the lawn and harass them. Here the neighbors slipped all over the place and that was funny and the scene should have lasted longer. There were laughs here, but the scene was cut too short. Don't we laugh when someone slips on a banana peel or ice? Sure we do. Don't we want to keep watching someone slip on a banana peel or on ice? Sure we do. We could watch it all day long. Cheech Martin as a policeman with dead-pan humor gave us the rest of the laughs. He should have had a bigger part.Dan Aykroyd looked like Tom Hanks with a fuller face. Can you see the resemblance?Yes, it is a disaster and if it weren't for the music and some pretty good dialogue in the second half, this would not have saved itself. But it did. Do we still have the Peace Corps?",Christmas with the Kranks
79,haydenluz,Christmas with the Kranks,1,6 January 2021,"Christmas with the Kranks was astonishingly stale, lacking creativity, heart, comedy, and everything else around it! The story was very unappealing and portrayed so poorly, just going beat for beat like any other Hallmark Christmas film. The screenplay by Chris Columbus was surprisingly dry, with terrible jokes, considering Columbus' history. Not even Tim Allen or Jamie Lee Curtis could save this monstrosity.Overall, it was very messy, unappealing, and a complete cash grab.

80,joe-pearce-1,Put Away Your Minds and Simply Enjoy the Film,8,16 February 2016,"I can't understand all the negativity from so many people about this film. This is basically a slapstick comedy, and aspires to be little more than that, with perhaps a bit of a moral at the end regarding selfishness. But it wasn't meant to be ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" or ""You Can't Take It With You"" or even ""Some Like It Hot"". The fact that it doesn't rise to Grisham's book's level is totally unimportant to almost anyone unless he or she has read the book. Even then, though, a film must be accepted or rejected, hated or enjoyed, based on its own inherent quality. A lot of book critics thought ""Gone With the Wind"" an overrated book, and then decried the classic film version as not being worthy of the book. Come on, now! This film was a lot of fun from beginning to end, with some exceedingly funny scenes and performances that made me laugh out loud (mostly from Curtis), and with no dead spots. It also contains a certain amount of sentimentality towards the end, but hell, it's a Christmas movie - should it have ended like ""Night of the Living Dead""? The lead performances of Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis really make the film, and they are ideally cast as polar opposites in the acting department. Allen is forever low-key and rather accepting of his fate, while Curtis is almost the Bette Davis of slapstick, and over the top in almost every second scene, but to these eyes and ears hilariously and appropriately so. The best actors, comedians, opera singers, etc. can make a special art of going over the top (think of John Barrymore, Tod Slaughter, Boris and Bela, Gregory Peck as Ahab, Eleanor Parker, Faye Dunaway, Mario Del Monaco and, of course, Ms. Davis). Curtis has been one of that elect company in everything from her early years in slasher films (what actress ever expressed more believable fear and horror in such unworthy fare?) to the hilarious housewife of an Arnold Schwarzenegger secret agent (what secret agent's wife was ever funnier?). But she is FUNNY, and Tim Allen is FUNNY, and that is exactly what they're supposed to be. This isn't Shakespeare and the director isn't David Lean. It is a slapstick comedy and must be accepted as such, and judged on whether or not it does the job. For me, it does the job superbly, and I would just mention that even the actors who are called upon to play it straight here, or even slightly dramatic, like M. Emmett Walsh and Elizabeth Franz, are totally credible (but when has Mr. Walsh ever not been frighteningly real?). So, if you can enjoy the film for what it is, and take note that the kids are probably greatly enjoying every minute of it, and that everyone around you is laughing as well, that's surely all the director and the actors ever strove for. As Clint Eastwood might have said, ""Go ahead. Watch the film. Make your day!""",Christmas with the Kranks
81,mungflesh,More horror than comedy,3,10 December 2018,"I tried hard to enjoy this film but alas, it's pretty abysmal. Its biggest flaw is that it isn't funny.Tim Allen's character is a man who has some sense in the middle of a street of bible-belt brainwashed suburbanites. One year he decides he's not going to spend/waste an obscene amount of money at Christmas and instead do something for himself and his wife (a holiday), whilst his daughter is travelling in Peru. Unfortunately, the Stepford neighbours have other ideas and are out to drag he and his wife back into robotic conformity. Sounds more like a horror movie really.It's in the Christmas sub-genre that contains Christmas Vacation and Deck The Halls but lacks the charm, wit and comic delivery of the others. The comedy is clichéd and infantile, yet deals with subjects that only adults could relate to; it just doesn't work.After this, I need to re-watch Secret Santa (2018), which is intentionally tasteless but loads of fun. Kranks is just tasteless - but it didn't mean to be.",Christmas with the Kranks

But their enthusiastic neighbors didn't agree with their action. Although the neighbors tried everything they could to persuade Kranks, it didn't work. When Kranks were preparing to leave, a sudden call from their daughter changed everything. Their daughter would come back. Time obviously was not enough to prepare the impending Christmas for just both of them.When I watched that Luther Krank gave the travel tickets to his neighbor who he didn't like, I was moved by the scene. Leniency is virtue indeed.Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis showed fully their comedian ability. Especially Jamie's exaggerating performance was better. She is my favorite comedian actress.

Is it really that odd for some folks to skip Christmas?All the acting is terrible, especially Tim Allen (as usual). The direction is flat, the editing is bland, the humor is only suitable for grandmas who aren't cool.Ugh this is miserable. Oh and it's very clearly shot on a sound stage, like a cheap TV show.Also there's no real point or moral to the story; I guess you shouldn't respect other's differences?

84,Sunsphxsuns,GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS!,10,12 October 2021,"""Christmas with the Kranks"" is based on the best selling novel by John Grisham, ""Skipping Christmas."" Like its distant holiday film cousin, ""Surviving Christmas,"" it was officially released in 2004 with the name change. Upon its debut, the film was indignantly maligned by mirthless film critics and audiences in mass numbers. It is difficult to fathom why so many good reviewers angrily transformed their ball point pens into ruthless, razor-sharp sabers. It was as if they wanted to shred this well intentioned movie into tiny pieces, reassemble the remaining fragments, then shred them again a second time for good measure.Perhaps ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is simply a misunderstood film, much like ""It's a Wonderful Life""(1946). It is likely that the film also needs the wisdom and healing powers of time to extract all of the vital ingredients which comprise this precocious and entertaining features.It's easy to follow the straightforward plot. It's Christmastime. It's snowing. And it is cold. Really cold. Desperate for a change, Luther Krank (Tim Allen) manages to convince his wife, Nora, (Jamie Lee Curtis) to recklessly abandon their expensive and frustratingly chaotic Christmas traditions. Instead, on Christmas Day, the Kranks will embark on a majestic cruise ship which will escort them to the sun-drenched, white sand beaches of the Caribbean.And why not? The weather is turning bad. Nearly all of the important retail stores are inundated with overzealous Christmas bargain hunters. Inventories of the better items are nonexistent. Even the overpriced, non-chain supermarket (Chip's) isn't going to be able to rescue Nora's failed quest to secure her family's traditional ""hickory honey ham."" Dan Aykroyd turns in a stunningly funny performance as the Krank's self-proclaimed ""neighborhood watchdog."" Aykroyd's fluid acting is blessedly over the top as always. And if that's not enough, the rest of the veteran cast is rounded out with slick contributions by M. Emmet Walsh, Elizabeth Franz, Erik Per Sullivan, Cheech Marin and Jake Busey.What works here? Practically everything! It is a joy to watch the middle aged Allen and Curtis struggling in their ""too small"" bathing suits and tanning booths. The not so subtle vein of ""holiday cynicism"" that runs throughout the film cleverly adds ""comedic depth"" as the couple faces each new holiday challenge.No spoilers here. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is not your typical holiday fare though it certainly has the ""legs"" to someday become a classic. It reveals plenty of holiday cheer (some rejected, but more accepted). If you can get past the stinging, bad reviews, and simply enjoy the cast and the excellent soundtrack, you're sure to find yourself adding this film to your perennial holiday ""must watch"" films.",Christmas with the Kranks
85,byson5186,You've Basically Seen The Movie If You've Seen The Trailer,2,9 December 2014,"It's the Holiday Season. A lot of us like watching Christmas movies during the Holiday Season. It seems like the most popular ones are the first two Home Alone movies. It seems like most other Christmas movies since then haven't done that well, and this is one of them. This movie tried to be funny, and I believe it is based off of a book called Skipping Christmas which I haven't read. I'm sure basically everybody who knows about this movie, knows it's about a couple that decides to skip Christmas to have a vacation and becomes vilified by people because of it. The movie tries to be funny, and tries to do well in making a holiday classic movie. I mean let's think about it, they have famous actors: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Dan Akyrod. If you've seen the trailer, or even if you look at the cover for this movie you know it's supposed to be a comedy with slapstick humor. But, what is wrong with this movie. Well, one I feel like this movie doesn't have much of a plot to it. I mean it almost seems like something that could happen in real life, minus the slapstick humor, and I doubt there's any neighborhood that obsessed with Christmas, trying to get every house to decorate for Christmas. I mean this movie shows familiar locations around the holiday season, like the mall, airport, and supermarket. It shows decorations out, and people dressed Christmas style. I mean kind of giving us that warm feeling of Christmas. It's taken to an obnoxious level in that neighborhood, and things get chaotic during the 2nd half of the movie. While if you've seen the trailer, or have even read the plot of the movie you'll know what it is. A family changing their mind to get Christmas ready at the last minute because their daughter is coming home. That doesn't seem like too much of a plot for a movie. I mean seriously, they could have just told their daughter the plan and apologize rather then try to make everything perfect for her, and just say something like maybe next year, because life continues and there have been 10 Christmases since this movie has been made, so Christmas will come again. I feel like my parents would do the same thing as Blair's parents, because I remember 6 years ago in 2008 when my parents made a last minute trip for Christmas, and I couldn't talk them out of it. My oldest sister was living in Slovenia with her husband who was working at the embassies at that time. They were supposed to have my brother in laws parents come over, and my parents were saying we definitely will not go to Slovenia. But, his parents ended up canceling sometime around now 6 years ago. My parents weren't planning on going, and we had even seen her and her family over at our house on Thanksgiving, but after hearing about her looking anxious to see if we'd be coming, they decide to come. I was mad at the time, while the trip was nice I don't like last minute plans when I had other plans, so it was flat out annoying. I feel like my parents and Blair's parents in this movie, could have kindly and pleasantly just said sorry that wasn't our plans rather then expect to satisfy what someone else wants. I mean plans have gotten cancelled for me, and you just need to learn not to take them personally, to see how life moves on, look for solutions, and accept it. So, I'll tell you that if you watch this movie it will almost seem like a waste of time. Tim Allen plays a comedic person as usual, but not a likable character, and this movie isn't as good as the Christmas movie he was in 10 years earlier called, The Santa Clause. A lot of this movie from remembering it seems slow. It doesn't seem like a fast paced Christmas comedy that will make you feel really lively after seeing it. It also doesn't seem to give a really good message for Christmas, so I wouldn't recommend it and I'm giving it a 2/10.",Christmas with the Kranks
86,Barry0169,Absolutely Dreadful,1,23 December 2018,I didn't make it more than 20 minutes into this movie because it was absolutely dreadful -- and I liked the book.

87,saint405,Predictable from beginning to end,4,2 December 2005,"What can I say about Christmas with the Kranks? Here is a little holiday movie based on a classic holiday novel written by John Grisham which involves a grouchy couple planning on skipping Christmas to save money. Sounds like a good idea for a movie right? It made a good book so why shouldn't it make a good movie? Well director Joe Roth asked himself that question and decided to make Christmas with the Kranks a big screen movie. Bad idea Joe! Tim Allen plays Luther Krank who's daughter just moved away to join the Peace Corps. While shopping with his sad and dreary wife Nora, played by a depressed Jamie Lee Curtis, on a really rainy evening he see's a poster advertising a Caribbean ship cruise that is only half of their shopping bills. Luther springs the idea on his wife and she agree's, only their neighbors don't. While all the other neighbors put up Christmas lights and Frosty the snowman, we have Luther and Nora getting tans and buying swim ware. But when their daughter calls and tells her parents she's coming home with her foreign boyfriend to spend Christmas with them at their annual party, it's a race against the clock for the Kranks to have another happy Christmas with their daughter.Here's the main problem with this movie. We have three great actors in this movie: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis, and the late and great Dan Akroyd. They seem funny enough to be in a little holiday romp, but they do not exceed as their characters. Tim isn't as evil as his novel self, Jamie is nothing but dreary and out of shape to play her part, and Dan is just showing off his age and receding hair line rather then playing an annoying neighborhood snoop. The film is weighed down to a level of corny with tacky jokes and a gooey plot that keeps falling apart every minute. You just begin to ask questions as the film progresses. Why should the neighborhood be angry at the Kranks for skipping Christmas? Why doesn't Luther and Nora just flat out tell their daughter they are skipping Christmas? Why not even invite their daughter with them on the cruise? It's major plot holes that shuts this film down without it even taking off.Now the writer of this film has never seen really good comedy's. This movie never shows a real funny moment. And if it does, it's usually a joke that's been reused over a thousand times. Throughout half the film, the plot just goes from corny, to tacky, to flat out dull. It's all about the neighborhood calling for a battle with the Kranks. Here we see Luther spraying his icy stairway path with a hose to topple carolers and freeze a white kitten to death. Is that really the only good joke the movie can offer? It's goofy twists like that is what sends the film into a spiral of wreckage. The neighbors do nothing but wine, smacking signs into the Kranks property, putting wreaths on their doors, neighborhood children shouting ""Free Frosty!"" at the top of their lungs. What else can we expect? Luther and his wife flee to their basement with their Frosty statue looking at them with an evil snarl of pain and hate.I expected better from Tim and Dan while watching this film. It shows how old they have become and what age does to your personality. It sucks the energy from you! The film begins slow with stupid wine jabs and rain humor, soon dishing out tacky neighborhood pranks involving stealing Christmas tree's and having the police come to the rescue, and it ends with a tragic note of sour bitterness and the happily ever after moment that makes you cringe with the thought of ""That never happens in real life."" Christmas with the Kranks is nothing but a tragic miscalculation turning a wonderfully written novel into a predictable flick that shows off actors age and slamming your head against doors. Christmas with the Kranks gets a 4 for being nothing but predictable. I say you should skip this train wreck and see another holiday movie fun for the whole family. This sure wasn't.",Christmas with the Kranks

We have to marry, we have to wear accepted dresses, we can't smoke marijuana but we can drink. So we have to live how other people want, if you decide differently you are done.

In the second half of the film it is pinned on him as his idea and that he's selfish. What?!

97,colettesplace,a crock!,1,14 March 2006,"Santa Clause and Married With Children's Tim Allen champions mediocrity once again in this tiresome film that glorifies the most commercial aspects of Christmas.After their daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo) has joined the Peace Corps in Latin America, Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and his wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) decide to save for a holiday cruise by ""skipping"" Christmas. Unfortunately, this reasonable notion inspires the wrath of their neighbours, led by Christmas Nazi, Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Ackroyd). While Luther encounters the resentment of his fellow office workers, housewife Nora's so terrorised by local children she has to hide in the basement. The two even make the front page of the local newspaper for their apparently churlish behaviour.Director Joe Roth struggles with a hackneyed script by Chris Columbus (adapted from the John Grisham novel, ""Skipping Christmas"") that suggests Christmas decorations, rather than cleanliness, are next to Godliness. As expected in this saccharine milieu, an emergency forces the Kranks and their tinsel-happy neighbours to band together and celebrate the ""true"" meaning of Christmas.It's almost impossible to enjoy Christmas With The Kranks, although being a child or an American might assist. Although there are some humorous moments, particularly earlier on in the film, even Jamie Lee Curtis' normally welcome presence can't save this movie.

99,Zoopansick,Ho-Ho Ho-rrible,2,9 December 2005,"This movie is one of the worst comedies I have seen in a long time, oh and yes I did catch Comedy Central's airing of ""Armed and Dangerous"" last month. The movie suffers from not having much of a plot and a non-existent screenplay. Instead it goes along from unfunny slapstick gag to unfunny slapstick gag. I usually like Jamie Lee Curtis, but she is so spastic and over the top that I was embarrassed to watch. There are no believable characters in the movie, or really anyone to root for. I didn't like either of the two leads, nor was I on the side of the obsessed neighbors. Dan Akryod was in this movie, but you wouldn't know it, his character might as well have been played by some other actor because none of his comedic talents were used (though it is arguable whether he's had any left since the 80s). The pace of the movie is fairly uneven, with slap stick bit following slap stick bit until the daughter finally comes home. You would think the movie would end there, but instead it drags on for another twenty minutes, incorporating a supposedly ""touching moment"" which feels way out of place in this movie and an unfunny side plot with a strange old man. Oh yeah and there is a burglar who gets arrested, and then released so he can come into the party...where he tries to steal some stuff. Yeah, I thought something was missing, good thing they put that in right at the end. Bottom line is this movie sucks, there is a lot of yelling and people falling down and very little dialog or laughs. But guess what, there are a ton of movies about Christmas, and pretty much all of them are better then this. Go rent National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, or Scrooged, or A Christmas Story, or The Santa Clause, or Muppet's Christmas, or Miracle on 34th Street, or It's A Wonderful Life, or anything else you can think of. Or better yet go to the store by like a bottle of Stoli and then go out in the back yard with like 2 of your friends and a camcorder and try to make a movie about Christmas, I bet it will be a lot more fun then sitting through Christmas with the Kranks.",Christmas with the Kranks
100,eXtreme23,Could've been better in a few ways,6,22 March 2006,"Based on John Grisham's best-selling novel Skipping Christmas, this comedy stars Tim Allen as Luther Krank, a man who decides to skip Christmas and all the surrounding trappings and go on a vacation with his wife Nora (Curtis) instead. But when his daughter decides, at the last minute, to come home for the holidays, he is forced to put Christmas back together, from his wife.Jamie Lee Curtis was actually funny in this movie. But I liked her performance better in the 2003 hit ""Freaky Friday"" where her performance was better. Tim Allen was okay in this movie. It seems like he is getting older, but he did alright. Now lets talk about the movie. I had a feeling that this movie was going to be funny, and it is. I liked how the whole neighborhood cares what Luther wants to do and how they act like it's there business. But I think the movie could've been better in a few ways. Let me just say this may have *BREIF Spoiler* but someone may expect this to happen, but how Luther and Nora decide to put Christmas back together, the neighborhood wants to help, after what they did to them. Also, how the fake the neighborhood could be. There is no way a neighborhood could act like that. Screaming ""Free Frosty!"" over and over again.This could be a delight to some families, but I think the best Christmas movie is definitely ""Home Alone"", I love that movie so much. I think families could see this movie and enjoy it, but there are better holiday movies to choose from. 6/10",Christmas with the Kranks
101,joliet-jake,the Santa Claus was better,7,10 December 2004,i saw this movie on a date with my girlfriend. I was thinking you know this will be good because Tim Allen is in it and he was good in the Santa Claus but I was wrong. I mean the movie has its good points but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. She had a great time but I thought it could have been better. For those who do not know this movie is based on a John Grishm book Year Without Christmas. the over all premise of the plot was a good idea but i guess the script could have been better. If you have a desire to see this for the same reason i did maybe you will find it a bit better than i did butt I guess that it could have been better. But because it made me laugh and i had a pretty good time 7 out of 10,Christmas with the Kranks
102,DaRick89,"Annoying, smug little Christmas 'comedy' which fails to draw any laughs",2,18 February 2006,"Christmas with the Kranks is the kind of Christmas movie you are better off avoiding. It thinks it is a funny film with funny antics which relate to Christmas, but instead it is a smug little film which managed to irritate the hell out of me with it's unfunny slapstick rubbish and annoying neighbours, not to mention the false, wannabe feel-good cop-out of an ending. All of this and it thinks it's the essential Christmas film? Ha! It's more anti-Christmas than anything else. While I'm pointing out this movie's flaws, I may as well mention that the best parts were on the trailer and that the trailer ruined this movie's only major twist (yeah, good one studio hacks!). After this twist, laughs are supposed to ensue, but all that ensued for me were blank stares at the screen, frowns and intermittent 'walk-outs' from the lounge room, spent doing something more worthwhile, in this case, watching the cricket.Why is it an anti-Christmas film? Well, for starters, after sending their daughter off somewhere, the male Krank (was the surname meant to be funny or ironic?) decides to pass up Christmas in favour of a nice Caribbean cruise. A major plothole occurs here when the male Krank types up a memo saying that he will not celebrate Christmas. Now why the hell would you type up a memo saying that you will not celebrate Christmas? Wouldn't you keep it to yourself? I would. Ah well. Anyway, his neighbours find out and hound him and his wife consistently, for days on end, precipitating antics which often fall flat, such as Jamie Lee Curtis' character diving out of sight of the window and Tim Allen's botox injection, which sent my parents into fits of laughter, but which made me frown in bewildered disgust. Then the major twist comes along, you know, the one which was exposed on the trailer. Then apparently, things start to get really chaotic and funny. Well, chaotic yes, but not funny. But by this stage I was intermittently watching the cricket, so I missed a lot of it.There happens to be a fair amount of talent in this cast, but all of it is more or less wasted because of this film's lack of - functional, for lack of a better word - humour. Yet again, Tim Allen tries to make a poor movie funny, but is unable to. Jamie Lee Curtis also tries to inject some humour into proceedings, but to no avail. Also, what is Dan Aykroyd doing here? He normally garners laughs, but here he is more smug than anything.Apparently, this movie is meant to be based on a novel by John Grisham. That in itself is quite funny, as I thought John Grisham was actually meant to be a good writer. Also, Chris Columbus wrote this. Just looking at his movie credits and I notice that he has written the screenplays for stuff like The Goonies and The Gremlins. You wouldn't know it, judging by the consistent flatness of the 'comedy' in this film.In the end, what more can I say? I really wanted to enjoy this movie as it is - a Christmas comedy. But the problem is, it's more anti-Christmas than pro-Christmas and the comedy, as I have obviously mentioned before, is as flat as last century's beer. I have been searching for a reason to give this movie higher than one measly star, but I haven't been able too, as redeeming qualities are in short supply here. My verdict? Pass up this smug 'Christmas' rubbish and go see a Tim Allen/Christmas comedy which actually garners laughs. Like both of The Santa Clause movies. Or Toy Story.1/5 stars",Christmas with the Kranks

104,vesil_vesalier,No. Just... NO.,2,31 October 2018,"The one thing that always gets my goat, regarding movies, is wasted potential. Tyler Perry ALWAYS strikes out just when I think he's finally going to make something special, kind of like Charlie Brown insisting on trying to kick that $%#&@*& football that Lucy holds for him, dropping the ball instead of throwing the touchdown. And this @#$%&^$ movie is no different.I don't hate Tim Allen. Sure, I thought HOME IMPROVEMENT was more annoying than entertaining, and the primary reason for that was because Tim the Toolman Taylor was a @#$$%^&$ idiot, but I think his comedy has merit, and I liked him in GALAXY QUEST. So he's not a complete waste of time.I don't hate Jamie Lee Curtis. Who could hate Jamie Lee Curtis? I loved her in the truly surprising TRUE LIES. I loved her in HALLOWEEN. I loved her in TRADING PLACES.I didn't #$%^&*@ love her HERE (though that's hardly HER fault).Dan Aykroyd isn't terrible, either. Loved him in GHOSTBUSTERS. Even loved him in MY STEPMOTHER IS AN ALIEN (yes, really. Lighten up. It was FUNNY). Sure, I kind of hate him now because he's a total sellout when it comes to how crappy the GHOSTBUSTERS remake was (and how he muscled everyone into pretending to like that swill), but before that, I liked him a lot.What sucks here is the PLOT.Mr. Krank and Mrs. Krank rule the Christmas scene for Maple Street and its inhabitants (No it's NOT actually Maple Street, but for those of you who understand THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this will make sense. For the rest of you, GO WATCH THE TWILIGHT ZONE EPISODE ""THE MONSTERS ARE DUE ON MAPLE STREET"", AND GET A TASTE OF WHY THIS @#$%^& ME OFF SO MUCH), a bunch of well-to-do middle class white folks, who love competing with each other when Christmas comes around, to see who is the better decorator. Fun, charming, not-at-all morally bankrupt morons, to be sure!This year, however, Darling Daughter is leaving the Kranks, to {bring fiancee home as a surprise shot to say ""Hey Dad and Mom! Getting Married!""} go to college.Well! No reason to celebrate this year! Let's go to the Bahamas instead!#$%^ that, says Dan Aykroyd's character, you better decorate with the rest of us!#$%^ that, says Tim Allen's character, we're going to get suntans!And merriment ensues! Merriment including vandalism, fear tactics, and isolationism! Hoo howdy!!The comedy falls flat, because it's out of place. The behavior of the Kranks' neighbors is SUPPOSED to be comedy, I guess, but it is ominous in its nature. Because the Kranks decide to go their own way, to diverge from the plans of the rest of the Maple Street inhabitants, a comedic WAR begins, failing in both potential and delivery. All to find out that, in the end, none of it was necessary.Daughter's actually coming home, Christmas is coming a la the Whos in Who-ville style, and the neighbors, now victorious (even though it is accidentally), band around the Kranks to make Christmas awesome again. Wa hoo.And then you have the mysterious Umbrella Santa, the guy who keeps showing up at the weirdest times in the movie, seeming to be a kind of Rod Serling character who's really steering the main plot in the direction it's supposed to be going in, without any real identification of who the heck he is or why he's in the movie.There's the suggestion here of Maple Street, a place where neighbors are friendly up until an aberration in behavior turns them into predators. There's the suggestion here that there's a supernatural being nudging at the main characters in subtle, simple ways to drive the plot in such a way as to make the final delivery something more than the sum of the parts of the film. And there's the joy of Christmas, sort of thrown in there, peanut-butter mashed against a window style, reminding me of WAR OF THE WORLDS with Tom Cruise in it, frustratingly smashing a piece of bread against the glass that separates him from the nightmare that he's found himself in.But for all its suggestions, there's never a DEFINITION. For all its possibilities, nothing gels. This is a movie full of ideas, and lacking of delivery. It's like seeing half a bikini on a mannequin in a window, of a shop that's going out of business.It's a mess. A horrible, terrible mess. But it could have been GOOD. Hell, it could have been GREAT.It's not. Stay away.",Christmas with the Kranks
105,Whythorne,"Pathetic Christmas ""comedy"" is laughable in effort",1,30 December 2005,"""Christmas with the Kranks"" deserves a place among not only the worst holiday movies ever made, but one of the worst of all time in ANY genre.The story closely follows the novel by John Grisham. The book itself is challenged from the get-go because it employs a formula which is all too familiar among holiday fare: the man who has lost his enthusiasm for the Christmas season but eventually goes through a personal redemption which restores his spirit. It is a theme that has been visited by everyone from Charles Dickens to Dr. Seuss, and so needs a lot of creativity and hard work to appear original. Unfortunately, Grisham""s plot followed a very predictable course and the result is a tale that is so tiresome that you can even sense the actors and the director of the film version were just as completely bored by the premise as most viewers will be.The story also suffers from the assumption that a family not blatantly participating in outdoor lighting, greeting card sending, party-throwing, etc. would be branded and immediately set apart as rejects of their local society. I don't know about the neighborhood where John Grisham lives, but in my midwest suburb, most of the houses don't even bother to decorate at all. Yet I don't see neighborhood protests occurring every Christmas season. Further, in an age when Nativity scenes are routinely banned from public display and use of the word ""Christmas"" itself is discouraged as politically incorrect, it is hard to believe there would be such widespread condemnation of one family's decision to ""skip Christmas"" so they can go on a Caribbean cruise.Having read the book, I was curious to see if the movie version improved upon the sub-par story. It is much, much worse. The development of the main character, Luther Krank (played by Tim Allen), into a man who is tired of the Christmas grind went too fast in the book and in the movie is barely established at all. In fact, we are led to believe it all comes about after one scene in which Luther makes a dash into a specialty foods store in the pouring rain to pick up a couple of items for his wife. What passes for creative slapstick at this time is Luther getting splashed by a car and his foot being submerged in a watery pothole.Brace yourself, because that is about as original as the pranks in this film get.While the main characters - Luther, and his wife, Nora (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) are hardly given any time to get INTO character, the character of the neighbors, and the Kranks' relationship to them is given none. It is almost as if the screenplay was written assuming the viewer had read Grisham's book and could fill in all the blanks. Hence, the much needed dynamic tension between the neighbors and the Kranks in order to establish some of the comedy is non-existent. Without build-up or justification, the animosity the neighbors have for the Kranks is forced, untrue, and very unfunny.It is unsettling to watch highly paid actors go through the motions, looking as tired as the story. It is as if they themselves had no faith in the film, and just couldn't wait to get it done and over with. Ditto for the director. I can just visualize the director saying, ""Okay, Tim, Jaimie Lee. One take and let's move on to the next one.""Even the cinematography looks tired and passionless. It appears as if even the outdoor scenes were filmed in a brightly lit studio. The story ached for a wide angle or bird's-eye panorama of the neighborhood to emphasize the Kranks' lack of participation with the lighting displays but we never see such a view. In addition, the scenery itself is so brightly lit you can hardly tell a difference between the Kranks' ""dark"" undecorated house and the well-lit homes of his neighbors.When a comedy falls this flat it is not pretty. Especially when the script tries to inject some instant pathos at the last scene! Ironically, Luther's ""conversion"" into a caring person, a scene that is intended to be moving, may be the most laughable aspect of a film that is entirely contrived and more pathetic than anything else.",Christmas with the Kranks
106,galahad58,Kranky from being robbed,1,19 November 2005,"Christmas with the Kranks. By far, this movie is one of the worse movies to ever have been filmed. Comedy? There was a total lack of comedy throughout the entire film. Luther Krank decides to skip Christmas. He informs all his co-workers and neighbors that the Kranks are skipping Christmas because his daughter is away on missionary work. He is rude and crude to everyone, which did not promote a single laugh. He avoids everything Christmas for no reason, except for a lack of good screen writing. Suddenly, the daughter calls and says she is in Miami and headed home. Now the Kranks have hours to get Christmas ready. Prepare the ham, decorate the house, buy a tree, buy gifts and arrange a party. You would think that maybe the laughs would come here, but they do not. Luther falls from his roof while trying to put Frosty the Snowman on the rooftop. His fall attracts his neighbors who ""suddenly"" decide to save the Kranks Christmas. Like it needed to be saved. They could have gone on their trip and still enjoyed Christmas. But what to do? Send the police to get the daughter at the airport so they have time to prepare. Here the movie drops into pitiful. The police try and delay and end up fighting a criminal. Was this shot needed? No. Did it do anything for the film? Just made it worse. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are just pitiful. Allen is terrible. Nothing he does is funny or enjoyable. Curtis, who has been a non-factor since her sexy dance in True Lies, whines the entire movie. Curtis is so annoying that you wish she would be left off the screen. This movie is a good representation of why box office receipts are down in theaters. I felt robbed of good money after seeing this film. I paid a rental fee, imagine taking a family to see this trash. I had to rate a 1, since it is the lowest you can rate. This movie is below a 1. Avoid at all costs. Burn the DVD if given as a gift, the temporary heat, it gives off, is worth more than viewing the film.

Has some decent laughs in it too.This is one of the few books I have read too. I had read the short book maybe a year before realizing there was a movie for it.

It can be funny in some places. I certainly don't regret seeing this movie. But I wouldn't have missed anything that great by seeing it either. It has a nice point. But I'm not entirely sure that everything in it was thought out that well. It could have worked out better than it did. But it can still be a nice movie. It just depends on what your thoughts are.

Always a talented supporting actor, he appears in this as someone who no one knew.

Christmas with the Kranks isn't bad, it's just... kind of boring.I mean, the first half was good. It set up our plot, it introduced the characters, it did a few jokes here and there, but then the second half came, the moment when the Kranks decide ""Screw going on vacation! We're going to stay home so we can please our 20-something daughter!"" You may be saying, ""Aw, come on! How could that be bad? They're just getting things all ready!"" Oh, believe me. It gets bad. The second half just goes on and on and on, from the scene with the burglar, to the scene with Luthor actually wanting to do the cruise while they're having the party, to the Marty bit, it's just so, so long and so, so boring. It just drags on and on and on and it feels like the movie isn't ever going to end! That's what has always bothered me about this movie. But on the other side, it has some good parts, but that second half really gets me. But then again, this was based off of a book, so I'm guessing the long and padded second half was also in the book, but you don't always have to follow the book when it comes to making a movie. I'm sure fans of the source material won't get mad that you didn't follow all of the book's aspects, but I never read the book, so why should I be talking?Anyway, that's Christmas with the Kranks. It has an okay premise, but the second half really goes on like a telethon. It sort of has the Christmas feel to it, but it's not the same feel as Deck the Halls. Hey! At least there's snow!....

115,whizkids,This is fun!,9,1 December 2004,"Based on the book 'Skipping Christmas', Tim Allen's latest movie is about a stingy accountant and his wife who are planning to skip Christmas because they're daughter's with the Peace Corps, and they wanna save a little money and take a cruise, which will actually cost less than half of what they spent for Christmas last year. But their neighbors are aghast. Skipping Christmas? Is something like that legal? Not on Hemlock street. And when Tim refuses to put up the Frosty decoration like everyone else, that's the last straw...This is a really good movie. Tim Allen does excellent Christmas movies, and this is his best one to date. This movie teaches about love, community, the downsides of selfishness, while showing, in a way, that Christmas has become a little too materialistic of late, though it forgets to point out why we really do celebrate December 25. But it also doesn't replace the real reason for the season with Santa, either. Well-done, funny, only negative scene is in a tanning salon, but it's tolerable.

I could only vision Tim Allen as Santa Claus - from the Santa Clause movies, and as for Jamie Lee and Dan Ackroyd - I was thinking in my head of what other movies they'd starred in together (Trading Places was all I could think of) The cast was incredibly under used, especially Austin Pendleton who I remember from Short Circuit!

Watching this movie is more harmful to your health than cocaine. That being said, here is a summary of what will go down in history as a movie that truly reflected its time.The Kranks, though they have such a harsh name, are your regular family. Father, Mother, Daughter. Its the day after thanksgiving, and their daughter leaves them (see, before the movie started, she had joined the peace corps). And the rest of the day doesn't work out for Luthor Krank. Chicago weather gets the most of him, and while walking drenched outside a store he sees a sign, advertising a nice tropical cruise. And this is a man who really needs a vacation.Soon, he looks at his enormous Christmas expenses, compares it to the price of a cruise, and he gets a brilliant idea: Skip Christmas. And so all is well. Until people find out that Luthor and Nora Krank have denied Tradition. What follows is an assortment of disturbing scenes as the neighborhood tries to win back the Krank's hearts. Two exceptionally troublesome scenes: The newspaper reports the family's wish to not celebrate Christmas in a smear article (front page no less), and the constant arguments about the family's decision to not but up a snowman completely identical to the snowmen on every other roof.When I was a child, I read the store Tootle the Tank Engine. Tootle was given one rule: Stay on the Rails no matter what. When he went off the rails, nothing was harmed. But he was not supposed to do it so all the conductors and engineers tricked him into staying on the rails. This book was written admittedly as propaganda to keep children following America as the assumed threat of communists grew. Right now, there is an aptmospher in our great nation, that says your for us or against us. If we don't follow, we are wrong. Whether or not this is intentional, the film feels like cold war era propaganda as it does not satirize the neighbor's constant assaults on the Kranks, but supports them.At any rate, this movie is a frightening monument to conformity and blind faith, and teaches us not to respect the wishes and ideas of others.See a much better Christmas film with political undertones: Santa Clause Conquers the Martians.0 stars.",Christmas with the Kranks

With no rooftop decorations on just one house, the usually glistening neighborhood will be in disgrace. When daughter shows up unexpectedly, the Kranks have to change plans and throw things together fast. While the film allows Christmas as a joyous holiday of basically good cheer, its tone is often cynical, artlessly showing the holiday as a tedious job dumped upon people without genuine sentiment.

The neighbourhood have obviously gotten so used to the tradition with the Christmas party always being at the Kranks' house, that they decide to harass and try and control the couple.In real life, the neighbours would simply make other plans instead of trying to force two grown people to do something that they don't have to and don't want to do.The ending of this Flick tries to get the viewers to see the ""neighbourhood community spirit"", and that would be fine if the movie plot wasn't the way that it was. I don't actually have an issue with the story line, but the ending I think should have been equal to the situation of the entire film, meaning NOT to have those terrible neighbours in their home and just have a quiet Christmas at the house with the daughter and boyfriend and explain to the daughter what went down.Don't be fooled by the ending of this film...when Jamie Lee Curtis says ""After all they've done...you couldn't say a simple 'Thank you?!' "", but what about all of the BAD that they have done?! I'm not saying that they shouldn't forgive the neighbours, just don't have them in the house after all the crap that they pulled.I actually do find this movie watchable until they decide to have the neighbours at their house.I'm not into Christmas that much anymore, but I like the Christmas vibe, and this motion picture delivers on that.",Christmas with the Kranks

How could they live next to people for so long and not really know them? Ackroyd's character, the neighborhood busy body...and his son, virtually steal the show from the Kranks'. It was a crime to see so much talent wasted on this movie. It could have been so much better. But, either so much was cutout of the movie or never written in...the losers were the audience.

126,Moonhawk1975,"Depressing holiday ""comedy""",1,10 April 2005,"How can you go wrong with a holiday movie that pairs Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis? Director Joe Roth has found a way. Based on the novel ""Skipping Christmas"" by John Grisham, the movie centers around a couple (Allen, Curtis), depressed because their daughter will not be home for Christmas, who decide to skip the celebration and take a cruise instead. While I admit I would've still decorated, the movie goes overboard in the reactions of the neighbors (led by Dan Aykroyd). Turning into Christmas Nazis, they begin stalking and harassing the pair to try to get them to decorate. I was not aware Christmas spirit meant decorate at all costs. I don't find the humor in the characters here who believe so. Making matters worse, about halfway through the movie, when the Kranks change their minds, it seems more like they did so out of giving in than because they wanted to. And their reason for changing their mind is preposterous: the daughter has gotten engaged to a man from Peru and wants to bring him home for Christmas. She goes on to explain to her mother that he has never seen a snowy Christmas because he spends it in Peru every year with his family. Why would she go through all the trouble of making last-minute changes to take him away from this traditionwhen she was already in Peru? I guess it fits the rest of the movie: everyone is centered on themselves. Allen and Curtis are the best things about the movie, but the scene of her in that tanning salon in the shopping mall is the least funny in a movie full of dead jokes. We even get a Santa Claus finale that does not fit the tone of what came before. Good job, Roth! You've made the worst Christmas movie of all time. Bring on ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians!"" Please.",Christmas with the Kranks

128,terrors89,Pretty darn good Christmas movie full of fun.,7,23 April 2005,"I disagree with the critics on this one. I thought Christmas with the Kranks was quite hilarious and ignored the sappy meaning of Christmas theme until the final 20 minutes. However once the movie reached that portion of the movie it slowed down painfully and left a sour taste in my mouth.The story is pretty basic, Blair Krank, played by Julie Gonzalo (Freaky Friday,) joins the Peace Corp. and heads to Peru during the holidays for a full year. The Kranks, Luther, played by Tim Allen (The Santa Clause 1, 2) and Nora, played by Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies,) decide to boycott Christmas and head to the Caribbean on a cruise, much to the dismay of the neighborhood lead by Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters, 50 first dates.) On Christmas Eve, Blair calls and tells her parents that she is coming home for Christmas with her boyfriend who wants to experience a true American Christmas with parties, snow and all of the trimmings. So it's a race against the clock to see if they can pull it off before she gets home.Like I said the beginning of the movie is quite hilarious. The scenes between the Kranks and their neighbors who want them to celebrate Christmas are the funniest I have seen in a Christmas movie since Natl. Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Luther with his Botox is just great.However, the last 20 minutes of the movie when the Kranks are trying to get the Christmas Eve party together, with the help of the whole neighborhood, drags the movie down a lot., so much in fact that you almost forget the laughter in the first act of the movie. There is also a pointless couple of scenes with a burglar that don't make since.I thought Tim Allen and Jaime Lee Curtis were cast perfectly for each other, all though at times Curtis reminded me of Patricia Richardson who played Allen's wife in the TV show Home Improvement. Along with Aykroyd, the supporting cast is full of very recognizable faces and some even provide humor to the story.Overall, I say that this movie is a pretty good Christmas movie. If the last half of the movie was as funny as the first half, and if they would have ignored the whole spirit of Christmas message, this movie would have been as great as my favorite Christmas movie of all time, the afore mentioned National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. However, since it wasn't and they didn't, this movie only gets a pretty good rating. But I still say go see and ignore the rest of those idiot reviewers and listen to me! *This movie review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*",Christmas with the Kranks
129,shacmasta,Very underrated and under appreciated,8,20 July 2019,"Another simple movie review....Christmas with the Kranks starring Tim Allen & Jamie Lee Curtis is a Christmas movie that seriously takes a lot of slack and doesn't make it onto many favorite Christmas movies lists, which is pretty hard to fathom.First Tim Allen is a Christmas movie giant. His ""Santa Clause"" films are a holiday season staple for the newer generation of kids who can't relate to the old time classics.Second...The premise of Christmas w/the Kranks is probably one of the more relatable storylines in recent memory. Anyone who has lived in neighborhoods where one can feel forced or pressured to decorate or keep up with ""joneses"" can honestly relate to the Kranks ordeal.Third...The cast. Allen & JLC are obviously the stars but the supporting cast is top to bottom hilarious. Dan Aykroyd as Vic Frohmeyer Is a classic. Hallmark channel's Rom-com vet Julie Gonzalo is another familiar face. Then you have strong on-screen gold with Emmet Walsh feuding w/Tim AllenThe cast rounds out with Malcom in the middle's - Erik Sullivan ,

My wife and I talked about the movie after seeing the trailer before ""Spider-Man 2,"" and we were not disappointed. It's not Oscar-winning material, but I'd rather watch a light-hearted movie like this (a matinée for $5.25) than any ""Kill Bill"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" extravaganza. Tim Allen, Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis have done MUCH better work, but who cares. If you want, or need, to laugh and feel good when you leave the theater, check out the ""Kranks.""

132,gspencley,Horrible,1,28 November 2015,"In my review I discuss the general plot, but I try not to give away any specific events or spoilers. However, I marked the review as ""containing"" spoilers just in case my discussion of the plot details is too much for those wanting to watch ""completely fresh.""I had the feeling while watching this movie is that Luther Krank (Tim Allen) is supposed to be a version of Scrooge. In Dicken's classic novel, Scrooge is both the villain and protagonist. He is mean and you dislike him, but he learns a lesson and ultimately changes. However, unlike with Scrooge, I sympathized very strongly with Luther Krank. After years of celebrating Christmas with his daughter, all he wants to do is take a vacation with his wife now that she has grown up and moved away. But his neighbours and peers, who are some sort of weird cult-like Christmas version of the Stepford Wives, harass and bully him to no end. Therefore watching this movie I didn't want Luther Krank to change. I didn't want him to give in and bend to the wishes of his horrifically creepy and annoying neighbours (who should have been charged for trespassing and harassment). I completely recognized his right to be ""selfish"" and live his life for his own sake rather than the sake of his community who have no business interfering with his desires. I do not think it is a spoiler to say that, predictably, Luther Krank learns a lesson and changes his ways at the end of the movie. However it is the wrong lesson. In Christmas with the Kranks the bad-guys win. I think the movie might have been originally intended as a horror movie instead of a family Christmas movie, a theory supported by both the evil neighbourhood and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis was cast as co- star. Perhaps if you watch it as such, it won't be so awful.",Christmas with the Kranks

I can't believe the director of this film didn't fire her while filming. It's such a stupid plot, two married couple decide to skip Christmas one year and go somewhere tropical. So the entire neighborhood flips out and does everything to stop them because the Kranks won't decorate their home with holiday lights and this massive sized snowman that everyone puts on their roof.

I was expecting something different going into this one, but I was really floored, like watching a train wreck. The entire first half of the movie revolving around the neighborhood Christmas Nazis demanding that the family decorate was really annoying. What business is it of anyone if someone doesn't decorate? People cant go on vacation for a holiday because the community demands you decorate for the holidays? Then the sudden change in game where they have to put it all together and make it happen with all the trappings. Apparently it's not about family and friends, but the lights, parties, decorations and presents, as well as conforming to status quo of what is expected. There is an attempt to make it warm and fuzzy, but it just comes off as a Tim Allen vehicle, including the neighbor who played his father in law on his TV show.This is pathetic attempt to solidify his standing with Christmas movies and leave a legacy. he should have stopped at the santa clause 2.",Christmas with the Kranks

And Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen are always fun to watch in comedic roles. But this movie felt like a short story with more morals that had to be thinly stretched to a full length movie. I would skip this altogether.The Chicago scenes are only missing the palm trees of LA to be a complete farce of the location. The humor sometimes hits like a 'Home Alone', but more often is so forced as to almost be funny as to how bad it is.

In that respect, the film is successful and in the end, a harmless holiday movie that tries to help us forget all the real world darkness going on. Tim Allen seems to be carving out a career with these Christmas movies. Though his performance is not even close to his Santa character, he still manages to put in a performance that has some memorable moments (the scene after his fat injection is a hoot). Jamie Lee is over the top and at times can be a little too much, but still, she fits right in with the rest of the decorations that are wrapped around this Christmas tree of a movie.

However, when I saw it not a single person walked out. Don't listen.

Ooops, my bad, the fake snow was so obvious that it took away from the nail biting script at times that it was hard to follow that these two people didn't want to put up Christmas lights. Save your 5 dollars and the 90 minutes that this film will steal from your life. It is so bad that if Jaime Lee actually cared about her career, she might be in trouble.

Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were quite hilarious together. I admittedly was not much for Jamie's hair cut, but that's my only complaint.Other then just being a funny movie, this movie's message is to put aside our selfish desires that can be so prevalent around the holidays and give of ourselves expecting nothing in return, just like Christ (who is the true reason for the season) did.

On the plus side, Tim Allen, though no Jimmy Stewart, is terrific as the man who disagrees with everyone and Dan Akroyd excels as the neighbor who makes a big deal of nothing. I feel the story flowed pretty well, containing some pretty clever present day humor, such as the use of botox and the overdecorating of houses during Christmas time. I also found some of the more serious scenes to be very heartwarming and a nice change of pace from the constant goofy jokes.On the negative, however, I must say that the story was a bit unimaginative/unbelievable. I highly doubt that an entire community would oust a family just for a refusal to take part in Christmas. In a sense, this is almost a show of distaste towards Hebrew families and their celebration Hanukkah. Similarly, I feel some scenes weren't necessary for the progression of the movie such as the little section with the thief.Despite the shortcomings, however, this movie is definitely worth watching. Kids will love the humor and even adults can find entertainment in the over-exaggerating of simple situations.

I don't care about its message, because in the end they showed he had the Christmas spirit after all. I like Dan Akroyd's militant neighbor role, and Tim Allen is no stranger to Christmas movies. It was generally meh though, but got a few laughs from me. One of my favorite bits was right at the start when that Santa was trying to sell him the umbrella, and later when the priest (Looney ""It's Lun-nay, it's French"" from Family Matters) encounters them at the tanning salon was pretty funny too.

Her performance was great too. The scene whenever she and the other woman shopper are trying to get the holiday ham is priceless. She reminded me of my mother with her mannerisms and her subtle cheerful smile to ""nice"" lady next to her. Tim Allen was also very good in this movie.

It reaches its apex through a winding road of logic that makes very little sense. I actually liked where this film was going at the beginning- a delightful commentary on the commercial obsession that is Christmas, and I felt a little jilted when it fell back into the feel-good Christmas movie at the end. HOWEVER, after I thought about it for awhile, it started to make a little more sense.Let's face it, Christmas is an insane holiday. It gives people a lot of grief, stress, and sometimes depression. In many ways, the amount of money that we spend on it is downright ridiculous. We don't NEED the to spend that much, but we do because we love this holiday so much. We put ourselves through hell for the perfect Christmas, a holiday who's many rituals mostly don't even have any roots in Christianity.This is a bizarre, crazy film about a bizarre crazy holiday- a bunch of neighbours get wrapped up in the trivialities while trying to express why they love Christmas so much. Are they psycho neighbours that 'turn on a dime' and suddenly become forgiving saints? No, they're just people. Christmas makes people insane, and insistent on tradition, but it also makes them forgiving and generous. And as much as this is not the most well made movie in existence (far from it), I admire the fact that it shows both sides of the coin- an amusing little glint of originality.It's a fun film.

153,sedenhansen-61849,Skip this one,3,20 December 2018,"Adapted from the John Grisham Novella Skipping Christmas (in which he unwisely departed from his legal thriller turf), the film tells the tale of a newly empty-nest couple who decide to forgo all their usual commercial Christmas festivities in favor of saving the money and spending half the saved amount on a warm Caribbean cruise. All their neighbors, friends and associates react with disdain or panic at the news. Not since the dreadful ""40 days and 40 nights"", in which a young man's associates become bizarrely obsessed with his decision to try a few weeks of celibacy, have so many film characters been so preoccupied with something that doesn't concern them. The casting seems like so many stunts; Tim Allen, who literally became Santa in the ""Santa Clause"" franchise, here turns his back on all things Christmas; Jamie Lee Curtis feels terrorized in her own neighborhood, an oblique nod to her scream-queen film career origins; Dan Akroyd, who in ""Driving Miss Daisy"" rubbed his traditionally Jewish mother the wrong way with his wholehearted embrace of Christmas, here plays the ""unelected ward boss"" at the center of the neighborhood's efforts to bring the Kranks back into the Christmas fold, and the often -lawless Cheech Marin plays a cop (who seems exclusively based on one street). Spoiler alert (though anyone who has seen a preview would know this): their daughter decides she'll be coming home for Christmas after all, and the Kranks go on a crazy crash effort to get all the traditional decorations and foods in place in time for her arrival. In addition to lots of irrational or clichéd characters, lame slapstick that deifies both physics and common sense pervades the sitcom-y story. Plus there's an utterly throwaway subplot involving a burglar. My wife and I saw this film free online, and that was bad enough. Paying to see this film would have been a lot worse. One final irony was that the film was released in late 2004, just about the time the farcical notion of a ""war on Christmas"" was entering the public debate; this story is of a communal war on those who would dare turn their backs on Christmas, or at least, its commercial aspects.",Christmas with the Kranks

155,mrfabulous1025,Don't bother with this wretched piece of crap,1,27 July 2014,"When a man and his wife decide to have a second honeymoon instead of an overblown expensive Christmas because they think they will be without their twenty something daughter, the plot of this hideousness exposes itself. They are made to feel guilty and harassed like they were child molesters by an assortment of evil and obnoxious neighbors and coworkers. Who are these jerks who think they are better than the Kranks. The Kranks would have an excuse ""if they were Jewish"" although the mention of the real reason for Christmas seems to elude the writers of this slapstick drivel. My birthday is on Christmas, I happen to believe in the holiday and I work retail. I find the horribleness of the totally commercialized Christmas ruining every frame of this disaster. It shows the worst parts of a ""Christmas"" celebration with some token tries at the end that are supposed to redeem its vile and selfish characters. This is easily in competition for one of the worst Christmas movies ever. Putrid and creepy this one should make Tim Allen ashamed. If you really want see a good movie about Christmas try The Family Stone with Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Keaton. Its not slapstick stupid but it is a much richer holiday experience,",Christmas with the Kranks

A surprise for me was not seeing one child in the theatre. I'd expected it to be full of children. Most were young adults. Come to think of it, I didn't see any older people either. Odd... But, the audience seemed to like it. There was quite a bit of laughter. And, everyone left with a smile on their face.Some of the humour was a bit cheesy at times...and, a good portion of it isn't believable at all. But, it was still a fun movie to watch. Unless, of course, you're one of those that requires a lot of sex and/or violence...then, this isn't the movie for you.The scene with the Christmas carolers gave me the urge to run out and find a group to join.

Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen vs a flock of mean and vengeful neighbors along with police officers, because they aren't decorating their house is supposed to be hilarious, but only comes across as unrealistic. You don't warrant arrest and destruction by not decorating your house, that needs to be convincing for the movie to work but it doesn't.

Then the cringe factor begins when the annoying neighbours come to the aid of the Kranks thats when the movie jumps the shark and makes the art of putting house Christmas decorations that would take many days to 1 and half hour rush getting the whole street involved to the whole town involved. including the firemen and their ladders and the only police officers in town to please Blair and her new Bo. Its unbelievable how the movie can change direction and you see the obvious hallmark moments in the 2nd half the halo Christmas by the front window effect. Anyways you cannot beat the movie Christmas Vacation for its dark humour, comedy, christmassy, but not going overboard with the halo effect and over the top family values something Christmas with the Kranks does which makes me puke.",Christmas with the Kranks
163,The_Master_Critic,this is one unfunny comedy,3,7 December 2004,"Watching 'Christmas with the Kranks,' I could feel my life slowing ticking away, along with what is left of Tim Allen's career. Save for a couple humorous moments, this is one unfunny comedy.Tim Allen plays Luther Krank who, upon hearing his only daughter will not be coming home for Christmas, decides that he is fed up with the commerciality of Christmas and decides to skip the Holiday and instead take his wife on a cruise with the money saved. At the last minute, his daughter announces that she will indeed be coming home for Christmas and the entire neighborhood must scramble to ready the Krank household for her Holiday visit.The story itself is interesting. It seems like a great setup for a funny comedy but somewhere along the way the movie just stops being funny. It drags along far too long and left me wondering throughout how much longer it could possibly last. The only funny moments in the film are showcased in the many trailers promoting the film, leaving the actual movie feeling worn out and tired.The movie is based on the book 'Skipping Christmas' by John Grisham. Not having read the book, I'm not sure if Grisham is to blame for this terrible movie, or if I should place the blame on Chris Columbus who adapted his novel into a screenplay. Or maybe I should blame Tim Allen who says he ad-libbed most of the lines anyway.The performances really aren't bad. Tim Allen does a good job with what he has and Jamie Lee Curtis is likable as always. Dan Aykroyd isn't as annoying as you think he will be and the other players do a fine job with their roles. As mentioned, the real fault here really is the script. I have a feeling that the finished movie is much more entertaining with the embellishments of Allen and Curtis than it ever should have been, which isn't a complement. I really can't stress enough how dull Kranks really is.Painfully Unfunny. It felt twice as long as it was, and it was twice as long as it needed to be. This is a terrible Holliday movie, and the chants of 'Free Frosty' may haunt you long after the credits have rolled.mastercritic.com",Christmas with the Kranks

165,w00die,What's the message here?,3,12 December 2004,"I think Tim Allen is a very funny comedian but I came away from this ""Christmas"" movie feeling like the Kranks had it right before they caved in to pressure from the well-meaning neighbors. There is no pre-defined way to celebrate Christmas. Each person has their own reality to face during the holidays. I think the ending missed the mark. Jamie Lee Curtis suffered from the script and direction. She's such a incredible actor and personality, I found her entertaining inspite of this crummy movie she couldn't save. But this movie is probably more entertaining and uplifting than if you rent Passions of the Christ which is the anti-thesis of Christmas.",Christmas with the Kranks
166,aschaper,Cloying Christmas Experience,2,13 January 2005,"When I saw the commercials for the film ""Christmas with the Kranks"", I actually thought it might be a pretty good movie, considering the fact that I liked Jamie Lee Curtis in ""Freaky Friday"" and Tim Allen in ""The Santa Claus 2"". At any rate, I waited until after Christmas to see this awful film, paying three dollars for a bargain matinée. Even for such a cheap ticket price, I still think I was robbed.Although I did laugh at Jamie Lee Curtis' scene of her frantically scurrying through the supermarket and Tim Allen's occasional sarcasm, as a whole, this film was just not funny. Moreover, it was deeply flawed and unjust. Who in their right mind would go around informing everyone at the office that he would not be celebrating Christmas? Moreover, what couple would have remained living on a block where every neighbor unwittingly minds everyone else's business, finds ways to torture and shame the one couple who chooses to leave the area to go on a luxurious cruise, and then that couple accepts the ""charity"" of those rotten neighbors as if they have done the couple a favor in getting them back into the Christman spirit? The neighbors were evil, and they should have been blasted, not rewarded and treated like friendly saviors. I wanted to see Curtis and Allen get away for the holidays, but to endure the torturous nosiness of the neighbors, the rotten children and their taunting crank calls, and even the priest eying Mrs. Krank's bosom. . .that was horrible, not hilarious.Some of the scene's were just plain stupid. Luther Krank's botox injections were dull, but his insistence on trying to eat with a frozen face bugged me more than it amused me.On top of that, at a later point in the film Mrs. Krank claims to be looking forward to leaving the wicked neighbors behind and go on the ten-week cruise with her husband; but when their daughter finally calls about coming home for Christmas, Mrs. Krank just changes her mind, without any real or believable explanation. Personally I would have (rightfully) told the daughter that I had other plans. Instead the mother agrees to prepare a party, shaming Mr. Krank the whole time about the ""stupid trip"". What kind of a reversal is that? Not even a believable one, let alone a funny one.This film had no point to its inception, it was unfair from the very beginning, and in the end it attempts to tie a bow of cloying Christmas cheer on top, as if that will make the whole thing bearable.I don't think so. This film teaches people that one should do everything possible to please neighbors and family, even if they are past placating, or even if it means selling out yourself and your own decisions: a terrible Christmas message.If I had seen this film before Christmas, I know I would have skipped the holidays without a smidgen of guilt.",Christmas with the Kranks

The story is pretty bad and dumb. But it has it's funny moments. The acting is even worse then the movie. The characters are not very good. And there are super much clichés in it. Even the secretly real Santa was there. The storyline is mostly a Christian indoctrination. Where they tell you it is impossible to skip Christmas or not be a part of it. And everything will push you in the way of still celebrating it. If you want to or not. If this was not the main issue the film would maybe not as bad as it is now.

173,neil_ward,As hilarious as frostbitten orphans,1,29 March 2005,"Adopted from the best-selling John Grisham novel and produced by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Home Alone 2, some other stuff), Christmas With The Kranks squanders a talented cast (Curtis, Akroyd) and portrays the eponymous holiday as a time for ugly lynch-mobs and soul-destroying conformity. Well done, girls!Former cocaine-dealer and Home Improvement star, Tim Allen plays standard 'everyman' Luther Krank. With his daughter leaving home for Peace Corps, Krank and his wife decide to ignore Christmas and save money for a Caribbean cruise instead. Unfortunately, what could have been a barbed critique on the shallow commercialism of a religious festival eventually conforms to high-street psychosis. After The Kranks' plan is exposed in the local newspaper, outraged neighbors subject the couple to a militant harassment-campaign, which successfully persuades them to re-consider (it is disturbing to contemplate how the neighborhood would treat Jews).Furthermore, The Krank's daughter announces her intention to return home for the festive season and tiresome, wacky scrambles ensue to decorate sufficiently and buy presents. There are numerous scenes of idiot-pleasing pratfalls (people slipping on ice, walking into lampposts, etc) while Luther observes the chaos with the perpetually 'stunned' expression of a man who has just found a penis in his ice-cream. Sufferers of any terminal-illness are likely to be offended by a spectacularly misjudged subplot.The nauseating conclusion implies that anybody who doesn't decorate their house in ludicrous neon-lighting and spend like crazy is un-American and has allowed their 'inner child' to die. As hilarious as frostbitten orphans, Christmas With The Kranks only succeeds as further incitement to despise Allen and Columbus. Rubbish.",Christmas with the Kranks

177,dadorner,Enjoyable,8,9 March 2016,"People criticize this film for a lot of reasons. Some vald. But to me I think the quality of the cast and some of the gags all result in a fun to watch holiday movie that is both enjoyable as a seasonal film and as just a light comedy. Sure some of the situations are contrived. And sure, some of the gags are predictable, but it has enough laughs and a Strong supportiing cast that flushes out enough family fun that we enjoy it a time of year. The novel this was based on was written in 2001 by John Grisham and was on the NY TIMES best seller list. The film doesn't follow that book to the letter but the film goes for more over the top gags. Jamie Lee Curtis is both the weak link and the Christmas junkie in the film. She shouts and laughs weirdly throughout the film as a simpleton , but on the other hand she plays nicely off Tim Allen's more subdued character. Tim wants to skip Christmas and take a cruise since their daughter won't be there because of a peace corps assignment. For some reason everyone in town, is especially upset that they are skipping Christmas. A little over the top. But the main problem is they won't be participating in the neighborhood decorating collective. Anyway one thing leads to another. And bedlam persists when plans have to change. Overlook the obvious pitfalls and enjoy some of the comedic moments brought to you by Allen and a cast including Cheech Marin and Dan Ackrpyd.",Christmas with the Kranks

179,hidarimaki,Ho Ho Hum,4,3 December 2005,"The past 70 or so years have provided us with some great Christmas movies, some decent holiday themed time wasters, and some true classics. ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is none of these.The basic premise involves a set of parents living alone, and their plan to forego spending thousands of dollars on Christmas decorating, instead using that money for a holiday cruise. The conflict though, is their neighborhood assuming that every house on the block should go overboard, and pressuring Luther Krank (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) to do likewise. Do the Kranks still want to set up a flashy holiday display? Was there a death in their family recently, or some personal matter which prevents them from enjoying Christmas this year? Did they just happen to change their religious beliefs over the previous 11 months, for one that doesn't celebrate Christmas? To the neighbors, that's irrelevant. And to those behind this production, such attitudes are normal. Even though I celebrate Christmas, I'm glad not to be in that neighborhood.Of course, even the writers, producers, and directors realized that they needed more to sell the story. So Luther Krank decides to forego decorating the house with the decorations that they already own in the house as well. If it's in response to his neighbors constantly harassing him on the matter, as a ""dig in your heels"" response, that would be understandable. Because even if Luther was the type who shouted obscenities and waved his finger at every sight of his neighbors, it wouldn't be justification for the ""comedy"" which the neighbors and their actions bring. From there, the rest of the movie should be easily guessed by anyone who has seen at least a few ""family holiday movies"" before.Is it worth seeing? That depends on your tolerance for mediocrity, really. Picture the blandest stew that you've ever had. If you walked into a restaurant which offered that same stew, with other entrées which you could actually savor, would you still have the stew? Your answer will probably be the same for whether this humorless, predictable, Christmas themed movie is worthy of your entertainment palette.",Christmas with the Kranks

188,enochbrandon,"Depressing, Angering",1,23 December 2008,"This is one of the worst, if not the worst, Christmas movie I have ever seen in my life. The movie depicts very scary and unfunny moments when the two main characters decide not to celebrate Christmas in the usual manner and go the Bahamas rather than putting out a large amount of money, almost the same, for decorations and other holiday items. Once Allen and Curtis opt out of the normal routine the are at once set upon, not surprised or merely baffled friends and neighbors but a collection of psychos, protesters, stalkers, and bullies. It is like, as another writer put it, like the Nazi's came out and are forcing them to do Christmas. I felt angry at the people and the neighbors, not just frustration but real anger, I would have frankly called the cops or something because it is sheer outlandish harassment and abuse. I felt like the movie was trying to portray those who celebrate Christmas as being over-the-top zealots and scary people. I know some neighborhoods have guidelines and letters for decorative ideas but the man in charge in this movie is like a neighborhood Gestapo (played by Dan Akroyed in his worst role). Allen's character and Curtis also do not allow for one to be way to generous. They are an aging couple of people who have sent their daughter, only daughter off to the Peace Corps for a winter mission, or longer. There were a couple of moments that made me think of my folks and made me laugh but I assure you that these were few and far between. Most of the time they are fighting with each other and tugging against each other and against the neighborhood. Two things I will say and then sum up. One, having left home during the Christmas time I know my parents, and I believe most parents, would not think twice about skipping the big Christmas traditions and would not hesitate to go on a trip somewhere, anywhere to enjoy their second freedom especially the Bahamas, so it's a rather lame premise to begin with. Second, it makes me wonder what kind of image this gives people in the world about who American's really are and how we celebrate Christmas. Again, I am living and working abroad and trust me Hollywood has far more to do with shaping their ideas about us then any one person or political party.

The true meaning of Christmas is evident in this movie as a man who puts his heart and soul into a vacation, learns that it feels a lot better to give, and to bless others. After snubbing the entire neighborhood, Luther is still blessed by all of their efforts to help him and his family.

When watching it the first time Christmas was months over and I guess I was doing something else while watching it as didn't see this as a classic. Now watching it 15 years later I can truly see Chris Columbus's influence. Although made in 2004, it has the feel of the 80's and early 90's classics that I'm used to seeing Dan in or even John Candy type John Highes films, such as #Thegreatoutdoors, #Unclebuck and even #homealone to name a few.

Maybe it was funnier for children. The only other movie I have seen Tim Allen in was Galaxy Quest, which was so cleverly written, it didn't give him a chance to bomb like in this one. I blame the director for the lack of quality in this film. Jamie Lee Curtis is a terrific actress, but every time she talked to her daughter she would absolutely flip out. The problem was, the daughter called about 8 times during the movie, so it was pretty unbelievable.

Who doesn't want a ""feel good"" movie for the holidays! Everyone needs a good laugh every once in awhile! Don't miss this movie. It's great for the whole family!

On top of it all, their daughter is coming home with her boyfriend, to spend Christmas with the family. She has a mad obsession with Hickory Honey ham and we have to go through some forced scenes, with her mother going to every shop, trying to get the ham.Tim Allen's character gets Botox and he tries to eat his food, with his face frozen.

199,jeff-tick,A very very juvenile Christmas film,3,29 December 2016,"The story-line had potential. A couple decide to disavow Christmas, opting instead for a dream cruise. I didn't read the John Grisham book,but can only imagine how much fun and intriguing it would be to portray a story of denial and a break with this iconic tradition. Instead, Hollywood plunged into their seemingly endless trove of clichés,corniness, and ""crappola"" to serve up something so ridiculous it boggles the mind that people are actually (well) paid to produce this insult to the art of film making. Luther Krank (Tim Allen) decides on a whim to buy a cruise and skip Christmas. His wife Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) hee haws for about 30 seconds (her inner conflict is irrelevant) before agreeing to go along with his plan. What ensues is a neighborhood and communal outrage (involving the police department no less) that is so juvenile and ludicrous that one has to wonder at what mentality this film is aiming at. Even if (and it is a big if) the story had managed some association with reality and character development, the acting (on all sides) is so void of any semblance of portraying a real person that there is really no reason to get involved with the hackneyed spectacle or even waste time on a more substantial review. I gave it a 3. (2 points are free, just because I like Christmas.)",Christmas with the Kranks
200,CoolMovieNerd23,"Remember, if you skip Christmas, then you're a heartless jackass...",3,20 December 2014,"For a movie that tries to have a heart, it just fails.So this is Christmas With The Kranks, one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen. You wanna know what's strange? The fact that this is actually based on a book, WRITTEN BY JOHN GRISHAM!!! Yes, the writer of The Firm and A Time To Kill wrote a book that was turned into this film. I've never read the book, but I just hope that it's less bad than THIS.So, the movie stars Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, as a couple that has a daughter going to Peru for Christmas. So as a result, Tim Allen's character decides to skip Christmas in favor for a 10-day- cruise, except NOBODY approves of this. However, their daughter, at the last minute, says that she's coming back engaged. Okay, for a movie with this premise, it should just be a Hallmark special. Because the movie is 99 minutes long, yet it feels like it should be shorter. I mean, the whole cruise plot line stops 46 minutes INTO the film, and when the daughter comes home, there's like a half-hour left, just to have Tim Allen's character have a change in heart. While giving the cruise to the old man character was somewhat sweet, it barely makes-up for everything, like introducing a burglar character, just to throw in the Santa that sells umbrellas to save the day, and it comes out of NOWHERE.Not to mention, it tries to have the ""Christmas is about family"" message, but all I got from this was that skipping Christmas means that you're a jerk, and it comes from the entire neighborhood. I mean,I know Christmas is a big holiday, and if it was up to me, I'd never want to skip Christmas, but if someone I knew wanted to not celebrate Christmas for ONE YEAR, I would be alright with that. But here, the neighborhood is constantly forcing these neighbors to celebrate Christmas, despite the fact that they don't have a family member with them, not to mention that they would probably do this just this ONCE. But it's not just the neighborhood, it's everyone around them. Our main protagonists literally have a news article about them skipping Christmas! Seriously, is no one considerate? There are like thousands, or even MILLIONS of people who skip Christmas, and you don't see people getting whiny over that!!! Yet, when they volunteer to throw the Kranks' Christmas party, they call out Tim Allen's character for being selfish. WHY?! I mean, yeah, he was rude, but he just wanted to go away with his wife since their daughter was gone for the holidays, not to mention that they were trying to save money. He was only ""selfish"" because you guys tried to force him into celebrating Christmas. So yeah, YOU GUYS are the ones that are selfish. You know, I wonder how they would react to the Jewish people.As for the jokes, they aren't the main flaw, but to be fair, some jokes DID get a laugh out of me, like Tim Allen's character on botox. But some jokes are just really mean-spirited, like the frozen cat gag, because I do want to see a poor kitten nearly freeze to death, and to remind me, you put it in the end credits.Just, skip this movie. I know that this film tries to have a heart, but it just sends a bad message. Do what you want every Christmas, don't be forced to celebrate it.",Christmas with the Kranks

The jokes were slow building...very slow building and when the punch line finally arrived it was disappointing. Most weren't even deserving of a groan. I think I chuckled once at something Tim Allen did, but I can't even remember what.(Notable because I am known for my ability to recall movie lines.) Even the costumes were boring and repetitive. (How many vests can one woman own?) There were so MANY vague, meaningless and extraneous details regarding 'supporting' characters that left us confused, bored, and stupefied. I don't know if the film lost it in editing or in the screenplay adaptation, because I heard that the book was great, but this film insulted my intelligence and wasted my time.If I had a choice between watching ""How to Style Hair"" the free video that came with an electric hair trimmer set, or Christmas With The Cranks, I'd rather learn to master the fine art of the Flat Top.",Christmas with the Kranks

I admit, the first about 15 minutes of the movie... boring, slow, and not worth my time. It's like they were saying things just to say things. HOWEVER, as time went on, I found the movie fun and engaging. I will admit the characters were overly dramatic, but it added to the sarcasm of the movie.

Allen and Curtis snipping at each other reminded me a lot of my parents and overall I enjoyed the film. It was no deep plot, laugh until you cry humor, but Kranks has its moments and you are left feeling good. I don't know if the film would have held together without Tim Allen, as he brought 80% of the big laughs, but overall a decent effort, not less than expected.",Christmas with the Kranks

Even if the setting is innocent, the contents is the same.In the end the Kranks are redeemed by fully complying with the Christmas festivity, and all is well, I guess as well as all those Jews that converted to Christianity during the first half of the 20th century.If you are tolerant and compassionate, don't watch this movie, it will provoke you and ruin your Christmas spirit.If you didn't understand anything I typed in this review, just go ahead and watch the movie...you probably will like it.",Christmas with the Kranks

I laughed a lot during this movie, and I love the parts where Nora is trying to get the honey ham. I want to cover my eyes, because it's so frustrating, but I can't not watch it. The end is also very good and heart-warming: what Luther does for those people, how the whole neighborhood pulls together to help Luther after he's made a complete fool of himself, and the whole thing with ""Marty,"" a.k.a. Santa Clause. I did think the part where he drove a Volkswagen bug instead of a sleigh was kind of nonessential and maybe a little dumb, but I have to give the movie a nine out of ten because it satisfied me. People who are against this movie need to just let go and let live; it is a good holiday movie, and if you weren't blinded by your uptight standards, you would enjoy it.

211,Sac-10,Good idea gone bad,2,27 December 2005,"My parents rented this on DVD for us to watch on Christmas eve (We were gonna watch harry potter, but I was working too late that day).Now I wasn't too sure about this movie, in fact based on the previews I wouldn't have gone near it normally. Still, the premise had promise, with the idea that after his only child is gone, the father of a family(Tim Allan, ""Mr Krank"") starts thinking ""Why am I wasting so much money on all the Christmas stuff, when I don't especially care about it? Why not a cruise with my wife?"" reasonable idea.The first bad point is how insanely idiotic the Kranks neighbors are, especially the Dan Ankyroyd character, who at one point takes to harassing Mrs Krank about a frosty statue by screaming out (with some kids) 'We want frosty'. It seems like everyone takes the idea of skipping Christmas to be some huge scrooge type thing, when it's painfully obvious that's not the case.Then the daughter says she's coming home, so we have the ""crazy"" Christmas dash, and in the end the neighbors all pitch in to help and show Tim how wrong he was, plus the wife keeps screaming on at him what a ""bad idea"" the cruise was, and then we get the silly ""Is Santa real? YES LOOK HE IS! AND HE HAS A CAR!"" at the end, to top off the stupidity.The whole point of the movie is constantly trying to cram down your throat about what a mongrel krank is for skipping Christmas...which is not the case. What made this point more annoying for me was the complete 360 the wife does and basically stabs her husband in the back at the end.As others have said, the botox scene is funny, but one scene doesn't make a movie, and the second half of the movie annoyed the hell out of me.All I can say is, thank goodness they rented Bad Santa and we watched that after this pap.Maybe good for kids who need the ""magic of Christmas"" but all others...steer clear of this garbage.",Christmas with the Kranks

I think some of the comments here are a little harsh, yes the film is not believable but the fun side of Christmas is all about ""make believe"". The characters are funny, Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are great in there roles, especially the bot-ox scene and the honey roasted ham scene. A one time or another we all would like to skip Christmas and we all have had the mad dash at the last minute to organise things. This film just takes all of those moments and pokes fun at them. It also manages to squeeze in a small moment of being aware that sometimes other people's problems are greater than yours. The film is full of different emotions and they all seem to work well, we all left with a Chrismas feeling as the last few scenes of the film are just plain old feel good moments that we all want out of to have.

As a huge fan of ""Trading Places"", and consequently also of Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis (both of whom are wonderful in TP), I mistakenly thought that this would also be worth watching.It wasn't.It was just... dull. The plot was extremely thin: someone doesn't want to spend money on Christmas decorations, and the neighbours get upset. That's what it comes down to. It's not enough of a plot from which to make an entire film. Okay, so there was one nice bit: when he gave the cruise tickets away. But to spend £6.50 on two minutes of predictable sentimentality is something I'd rather not do again.What I found most pathetic is how worked up everyone was getting over nothing.

216,mainsman,Pure drivel,2,25 November 2015,"This is not a good movie. While the premise is an interesting one, the move is a failure on almost every level. To start, the acting is dreadful. Being a Tim Allen fan (The Santa Clause is one of my favorite Christmas movies), his acting in this movie is wooden and listless. In most scenes, it appears as though he is struggling to remember his lines. As bad as he is, Jamie Lee Curtis is somehow even worse. The entire move she appears frumpy and disinterested, until her daughter calls and suddenly it's as though she just found out she won the lottery. Three or four times she shrieks, ""BLAIR!"" when her daughter's name is even casually mentioned. Just awful. The supporting characters don't offer much either, even with some decent comedic names (Dan Aykroyd, Cheech Marin, among others). Next, the script is bad. As stated earlier, the premise of a family choosing not to celebrate Christmas amongst a community that holds the season in the highest regard could be funny if done correctly. Unfortunately, the reason behind it is murky. Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) are spending the first Christmas without their (now) grown daughter. Luther, who is portrayed as a real tightwad, suggests that the two of them sail on a luxury cruise instead of spending the holiday at home, thus saving money and escaping the depression of having an empty nest. Fine. How that leads to a full boycott of every aspect of Christmas is not really explained. However, Nora buys in hook, line, and sinker. Then, the daughter surprises mom and dad by flying in from Peru with new fiancée. Suddenly, Luther is chastised by Nora for having planned this in the first place. Why, you ask? It's not really clear. Yet, for some reason the mere suggestion of planning a vacation over Christmas is so awful, they go to great lengths to hide it from their daughter. ""She must never find out about your idiotic plan,"" says Nora. Huh? Finally, the movie is disjointed. It's almost as though the Director finished filming and noticed he only had a 70 minute movie. How do you fill the extra time? Add a strange Santa Claus character, and a robber that serves no purpose to the story. Also, add plenty of physical comedy gags that are overly done and fail to hit their mark. In fact there are two funny parts in the entire movie: Tim Allen eating/drinking after getting BOTOX injections, and an inadvertent scene of a fireman getting hit in the face with a ladder - which the director (thankfully) left in, increasing the comedic value by 100%. Avoid this movie.",Christmas with the Kranks

It will also make you feel like you need to be with your family this Christmas. The ending is so heartwarming and it shows all the true sides of Christmas and what it's really about. If you're looking for a great Christmas movie to watch than this is it! The actors themselves were great, but I think that we needed a little more background information on the characters to be able to understand what they did and why they did those things. We need a little more information about their past. All we know is that they are major Christmas freaks that go WAY out of their way to throw parties, decorate, and get get everyone in their neighborhood into the Christmas spirit.

Firstly there's the belief in the old triumph of hope over experience that this Christmas will be better than last year; secondly there's the exploration of human relationships on a personal, family and community basis. Luther sets out to please himself and his wife; but deep down he knows it's just an attempt to fill the void in the empty nesters' lives. As a family they are close and the plot develops the changing relationships within the family. On a community level, it takes a few pot-shots at the pressure to conform in society, but ultimately it celebrates and affirms community values, however tiresomely they may present themselves from time to time. The essence of the movie is that we should take time to appreciate that which we have, as when it's gone, it may be very hard to bring back.",Christmas with the Kranks

But I feel the need to comment on this, and this is based solely in ANGER.Acting, direction and camera are all run-of-the-mill solid. The slapstick is predictable and not funny because of that.But for the script? A couple with a kid in the peace corps (ooooh, good) has the audacity to ""skip Christmas"". Their neighbours (and his colleagues), led by a fascistoid overseer, decide that because of this they are worthy of scorn and hassle. ""We only want Frosty"", is the neighbours' demand put forth (in the Christmas spirit, I am sure) while the wife calls her hubby on the phone in a panic. The feeling conveyed by that scene would actually allow for a SWAT team; the viewer wouldn't be surprised.The couple changes their minds, because peace-corps-daughter apparently decided that her help wasn't needed over Christmas. And since she is only 20-something, she and her fiancée need to have a bells-and-whistles Christmas prepared for them. Of course, now the community that hassled our protagonists before rallies to make this come about. This is accepted gratefully - no hard feelings. Even the cops pitch in by picking her up from the airport. Hadn't they done so (and prevented crime instead, let's say), the overseer would've called their chief.The underlying theme is, sorry to say, fascist. If you divert from the norm, you are prey for the community to attack freely.

227,red_eye-56581,One of the greatest things humanity has ever put out,1,8 February 2021,"Luthor and Nora Krank make the single most offensive choice in human history: they don't want to celebrate Christmas one year. Oh, they come up with many lame excuses for why - mainly that their daughter has left home for the peace corps and they want to go on a holiday cruise liner to recover from their empty nest syndrome. Thankfully, those horrible excuses do not work on yours truly. I knew immediately the true reasons why they didn't want to celebrate Christmas: they're mean ol' grinches, looking for any excuse to not celebrate the holiday.Thankfully, their neighbors are bold enough, heroic enough, gallant enough, to harass, stigmatize, and picket the Kranks on a near daily basis. As Jesus would have wanted them to. In an equally bold show of strong priorities, the neighbors place their emotional well-being on whether or not the Kranks put up a couple decorations that year. As they should for that is what's most important about the birth of Jesus Christ. Our block of heroes urge the Kranks to make the right choice of forsaking their individuality and conforming to the smallest whims and wishes of these brave souls. And mean ol' Luthor has the audacity, the sheer nerve, to hold a grudge against the people who mock him to his face.Thankfully, the daughter makes a very smart life choice in returning home with only a few hours notification to show off the fiancé she's been engaged to despite knowing for less than a month. This forces the Kranks to give in the neighbor's demands and celebrate the holiday that has burnt them out. And the neighborhood, in a great show of compassion and open arms to others, make this task as difficult as possible for the Kranks. This is a wise move as it ensures the Kranks will only grow closer and more thankful to their neighbors as time marches on.Christmas With The Kranks takes a stance for the true meaning of Christmas: spending money on a lotta stuff. It shows the unending evil of a couple who refuse to buy Christmas trees and put up a Frosty the snowman decoration just to help themselves heal from a life crisis. It shows just how fulfilled and spiritually complete you are after you've spent $6,000+ on things you don't need. It shows the unity of a neighborhood coming together to bully and harass those who act differently And it teaches you the most valuable lesson of all time - that anyone who doesn't celebrate Christmas is, as Dan Aykroyd so maturely puts it, a spoiled, selfish little baby.We could all learn a lot from this film. Its message of anti-individuality and pro-conformity could only help heal this Earth that has been so violently ravaged by cults and domestic terrorist groups built upon independent thought and freethinking. This is a must watch film for anyone who wishes to maintain their sanity.",Christmas with the Kranks

229,richio_r87,Nice Lil' Xmas Film,7,5 March 2007,"If like me you shake with excitement at the first mention of x-mas, even if its mid July you will appreciate this film. It has all what you would expect from any stereotypical x-mas film and more. With a storyline more over the top than the jokes you find in your Christmas crackers over dinner and more lovable characters than the Muppets Christmas Carol i can safely say you will want to put your trimmings up early after sitting down with this film and a cup of Eggnogg. Its almost a guarantee you will laugh at a number of different scenes but at the same time be deeply touched by others. I wouldn't say this film was up there with classics such as Home Alone and National Lampoons Christmas Vacation but it is worth a look and will definitely be included in my play-list this coming Christmas.",Christmas with the Kranks
230,mbrookbank,Should be titled Cranky Christmas,1,5 December 2004,"I went into this movie expecting a sort of silly slapstick comedy, a la National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation - silly but fun, something to make me laugh after a long hard week of work. But don't believe the trailers - this movie is nothing of the sort. In fact, what I got was something very frightening and disturbing - the moral of this story is ""conform or else"". What sort of twisted Christmas message is that supposed to be?**Spoilers below this point**The Kranks are having that empty nest feeling for the first time this Christmas - so to help themselves out, Mr. Krank decides to take them both on a wonderful 10 day cruise for Christmas instead of doing the regular holiday schtick. Frankly, what woman wouldn't love that? I know I would...So to save up money for this trip, they forego the traditional cards, presents, tree, etc, and basically just tell folks Merry Christmas and we'll see you next year. You would think they admitted to being Satanists and that God was dead. They are ostracized by neighbors, coworkers, so-called friends. The neighbors all whisper about how 'selfish' they are being. How 'terrible' that they are acting this way. What is this, the Borg Collective? Be assimilated or die? Since when is it not OK in this country to do something different? To act in a different manner? (Can you say Mccarthyism kids, I knew you could...)There is something fundamentally wrong with the message this movie sends. Why is doing something nice for your wife a bad thing? Since when?? This is just not right. And frankly the fact that a movie like this made it to the theater is downright scary.Oh and am I the only one who found the Frosty on every single friggin' roof a tad freaky? I felt like I was watching the Stepford neighborhood...just very very weird and bizarre to see that. Overall - if there was a negative rating I would give it. This is bad on so many levels. Please don't go see this movie. See the Incredibles. National Treasure. Heck there are more laughs in Seed of Chucky. Or better yet, go rent National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Now THATS some good old fashioned fun....",Christmas with the Kranks
231,wizardfan,"(Speculatively) Horrible, but No Worse than American Culture in General",1,22 July 2007,"This film is based on the John Grisham novel, ""Skipping Christmas."" Tim Allen, who has done other Christmas movies, stars in it.That is all that I can factually say about the film. The rest of this review is pure speculation, as I can assure you that I have never seen the actual movie. But when you are finished reading this review, I think you will see that my review is in every detail totally correct.Taking into full account the fact that ""Skipping Christmas"" is one of John Grisham's rare ""non-legal"" novels, I can nevertheless speculate based on everything I know about Grisham's work, that it necessarily contains the same kind of trite plot lines, clichéd emotions, telegraphed catharses, and wholly quotidian and maudlin epiphanies that we see in the rest of Grisham's novels-- and in just about the entire rest of American culture from, say, about 1970 through the present.How do I know this? Because I think clearly and because I live in America.The average American who reads this might be thinking, ""That's mean,"" or ""That's an unsubstantiated claim."" I don't think so.As an aside, Tim Allen adds to his list of Christmas movies. Some might say he has done the Santa Clause films one through -- how many? 17? -- because he is in the Christmas Period of his career, much like Picasso's Blue Period. Some might say that Tim Allen would not do a movie that is bad. Therefore, reasoning back from ""Christmas with the Kranks"" a/k/a ""Skipping Christmas,"" Grisham's novel becomes by this logic a dizzying artistic height, and if ""Christmas with the Kranks"" does not give us ALL the theatrical glories of Allen's work on, say, ""Home Improvement,"" it is nevertheless a developmental stage in a career of cinematic genius.Some might say these things, but I don't know who they would be, and if they exist, they would be pretty crazy and/or stupid.By the way, there is no need to rent this movie right now (7/22/07), because it is a Free Movie on Comcast on Demand; another clue, and a very telling clue at that, as to its quality.",Christmas with the Kranks

The DVD case smelled of slapstick humor wrapped up as an all American Hollywood Christmas flick. It was. But it was an all American Hollywood Christmas flick trying so hard to be ""oh so sweet"" - and it failed completely!The plot is ridiculous - avoiding Christmas at any cost and that apparently includes being a modern Scroodge, only this is a ordinary average Joe, changing his Christmas attitude because he wants to go on a cruise - not even saying merry Christmas! Performances are okay, but it could just as well have been lousy actors - it wouldn't have made it any worse. Even the best actors in the universe wouldn't have been able to save it.In short: Totally superficial Hollywood nonsense, not the least heart felt and best to avoid.merry Christmas to all",Christmas with the Kranks

I actually waited for the end to see there was any redeeming value to it; no way. These morons ruined Christmas; I'm scared permanently from this pile of crap.

We have a DVD Player that cuts out any cursing so it bleeped out only once. I love Tim Allen, he's so funny to me anyway, I'm not hard to please. I thought that Luther was being a little selfish at the end. I don't think going on a cruise instead of participating in Christmas traditions was wrong, hey they could have save money. (but who wouldn't want to be with family & friends during the Holidays) I thought his neighbors should have respected that, but at the end when his daughter surprises the parents, he should have been a little more excited about his daughter being home for the Holidays. I'm not hard to please when it comes to movies. I can tell the viewer that didn't like it must have been a man, only men down chick flicks:) I think thats what made it funny, that you don't see nosy neighbors that care so much to do the extreme things that they did.

Based on John Grisham's, Skipping Christmas, the Kranks do just that. Well, they try. Christmas with the Kranks is a different kind of Christmas movie, trying not to follow in the footsteps of classic films before it. Instead this an unique movie with a unique story. Sure it has a few issues, some parts of the plot are just plain dumb, and some of the humor doesn't quite work, but none of that really matters as here is a movie that, while it doesn't tell the viewer what Christmas is all about, it does its best at showing some important aspects of our Christmas culture, and the importance of tradition",Christmas with the Kranks

A funny movie filled with the realistic pitfalls of living in suburbia while maintaining individuality and free will. The neighbors are the perfect representation for how the ""spirit of the season"" gets swept up in the commercial excess. Continually seeing the Kranks get socially and emotionally pummeled as each new antagonist reacts to not getting their demands met gets a little annoying, but overall it hits the mark in message and delivery.

I was disappointed to see so many horrible reviews of ""Christmas With The Kranks"" but decided to see it anyhow. I am glad that I decided to see it. I laughed throughout the entire movie. It followed the book very closely. If you've read the book and liked it, you will love this movie. I've read some reviews either here or elsewhere that act as though there aren't neighborhoods where EVERYONE is expected to join in on the Christmas celebrations and lights, decorations, etc. Well, I'm here to tell you that there are MANY places like that. It's in the deed restrictions and you know it before you purchase your home there. So to those of you that are reviewing this movie badly because of that aspect of the movie, deal with it!! You don't have to buy your house on a street like that... but this movie does take place in that kind of neighborhood.

240,robbyscot,Utterly disappointing. A true waste of time. Get something else.,1,28 November 2005,"How can I begin to describe the disappointment offered by ""Christmas with the Kranks""? It is truly mind-boggling. For a comedy to be funny, it must have at least a *shred* of believability . . this one doesn't. I had heard a good review of this film from a particular critic (whom I won't name, to avoid committing SLANDER). So I rented it and I got the wife and kids together to share the fun. The kids left within the first twenty minutes. My wife and I kept looking at each other in bewilderment at the lack of any real humor. We kept agreeing to give it ""just five more minutes"". We finally gave up at about the 45-minute mark. If you want to be actually entertained by Jamie Lee Curtis, then rent ""True Lies"" or ""Trading Places"", both of which are very good. If you want to have fun watching Tim Allen, then get ""Galaxy Quest"" or even ""Jungle 2 Jungle"". But whatever you do, skip ""the Kranks"".",Christmas with the Kranks
241,DKANTE21,A Feel Good Movie Attempt Misses the Mark,3,14 December 2004,"This movie was like a ride on a small roller-coaster. There was a lot of anticipation of a good time, but this did not happen. There were a few funny moments, but they were repetitive (Jamie Lee falling on her face, Tim Allen eating after the Botox injections) for example. The ending was so sappy that I am surprised that there were not buckets to catch the syrup running off the screen. These actors generally are in films of higher quality, and I was disappointed with the end result here. I have not read the book, so I do not know if the original was lacking, or if this is just a poor translation to the screen medium. I was relieved when the movie was over, and did not find the sound track memorable.",Christmas with the Kranks

The actual plot was some-what unique, but the underlining story was very common for this sort of movie. Very much a seasonal movie to bring the kids to. It had some nice humor in for the older people though. If you're a Tim Allen fan you probably will like most of his jokes through out the movie. I recommend waiting for DVD/video, but if you see an x-mas movie this year, this might be the one to catch. The chemistry between the two main characters (Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis) was just like in Home Improvement.

It has a lot of great laughs but doesn't forget to add in the necessary heartwarming (but not too manipulative) feel-good Christmas moments.Parts of it were reminiscent of ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation"", but much less vulgar and violent.We only had two problems with the movie. One is that parts of it were very predictable, as we were commenting on what would happen, and even coming up with the correct dialogue, before it happened on screen. The other problem is a specific scene, which involves people wearing swimwear that they're not built for.Other than that, we highly recommend it.

I read the book and loved it (John Grisham is a great author!), and I figured that since his other books that became movies were pretty good (The Firm, The Client, etc.), this one would be no different. I was wrong. It follows the book pretty closely, but I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the characters in the movie, which I did feel when I read the book. They've added some fluff to the movie that wasn't in the book (Marty is Santa Claus, the thief, etc.) that doesn't really do anything to make the movie more enjoyable or funny.

It's hard to describe, but watching this movie was a very disturbing experience.I'm honestly wondering how this piece of crap ever made it into the theaters. The only explanation I can think of is, that maybe the company thought the big names would be enough to make people pay for watching this 'thing', despite the warnings of everyone who has already seen it.",Christmas with the Kranks

There was barely a moment where the movie can break a smile onto your face let alone laugh. Chris Columbus has obviously lost any ability to write a decent screenplay because even with a lame plot the characters were given no depth and pathetic attempts to give Tim Allen something he could work with to bring a chuckle to a disappointed audience left everyone flat. Jamie-Lee Curtis is not believable as the very day housewife. Perhaps the only character who fit in was the cat who had to make a few hissing noises to bring humor.

The movie, I thought, was actually better than the book. When you have good actors/actresses, playing the star roles it really comes over the top. I thought this movie was hilarious. It puts me in to the holiday spirit. I can't wait until the DVD/VHS comes out, I will definitely add it to my movie collection. This movie gets very high marks from me.

As most people would agree the book is always better than the movie. Well in this case the movie is equally as good as the book. One problem was at the start we see Nora going off somewhere at the airport. We don't know why???!!!! We don't know where she's going???? It is a bit frustrating watching all the angry neighbours getting angry at Lutor for some reason.They are ridiculously making comments on his antics this Christmas.

I would like to say something like, ""If it had more closely followed the book, it would have been better"", but that would be a lie.I have read the book, and hated it. During the height of John Grisham mania, someone did a sketch on ""John Grisham can write a laundry list out, and some publisher will fight to sell it."" I honestly thought, this was John Grisham's testing that ludicrous theory by writing the worst book he could imagine, and seeing if it sold.The plot was something out of a sixth-grade writing assignment. I felt nothing for the characters but vague distaste.Take a lackluster book, and mix in silly sight gags and you have a must-miss film.

The feature's site at Sony mentions within the director's comments an extensive tribute to Alan King, who played Luther Krank's boss in the movie.. I believe credits in the movie also dedicated the film to Alan King, as he died three weeks after the shoot. I couldn't find his name in the credits section on IMDb, and was curious about his actual performance -- it got a lot of positive notes on the actual site -- which I actually fail to remember in an otherwise uplifting film. I saw the movie with my younger kids, but due to distribution vagaries, it was shown a few months after Christmas. What came out was a message that transcended the actual Christmas season and impressed them about the values of solidarity beyond a festive occasion.

259,sont97,Tim Allen's A Christmas Carol,2,11 January 2015,"In this film, Tim Allen plays Tim Allen, better known as Luther Krank. He is a stingy man, but somehow is married to Jamie Lee Curtis. How much money he had to pay for this arrangement, the world may never know. It must have been enough money to convince her to have a child with him, though not enough to have two. In any case, their money child is not planning to be home for Christmas, so good ol' Tim decides that it would be a good idea to get a fake tan, go on a cruise, and skip Christmas this year. But his plans are sabotaged by the 10th Crusaders, his friendly neighborhood Christian soldiers, led by Dan Aykroyd, who insist that he decorate his house, and in particular, put up Frosty the Snowman. Frosty makes a nice cameo in this movie, though he seems to have gained some weight since the 50s. It was especially heartwarming when later he is hoisted onto the Kranks' roof with a noose, and tragically falls to his death, conveniently getting to miss the rest of this terrible movie. But everything changes when the Kranks' daughter shacks up with a handsome Peruvian and decides to come home for Christmas. The Kranks decide to celebrate their neglected holiday, and this makes for the classic Tim Allen plot device: just when you think they can't possibly mess it up any more, through a stroke of luck they do just that. From stealing a Christmas tree to fumbling a ham to picking their daughter up in a cop car and driving her home with a convicted felon, the Kranks manage it all. But luckily, in the end their neighbors all come together to help them set up for Christmas, and spread the wonderful spirit of the season.I'm trying to figure out how to craftily mention the moral of this story, but I've decided that I'm going to do it just as cleverly as the writers did when they revealed it: Santa Claus is real! Who would have thought that an unsuccessful umbrella salesman was actually old Saint Nick himself? The moral doesn't involve the spirit of Christmas, no no my friends, it involves the fact that Santa Claus truly exists. And worst of all, he has neglected the Kranks for years, forcing them to spend money on their own gifts (the driving plot point of the movie), until he finally relents and gives them a ham when he is randomly invited to their Christmas party.The only saving grace of this movie was the token black family, who add a lot of diversity, and really distract the viewer from the complete absence of Jewish people in Tim Allen's neighborhood. But I have to give this movie two stars for the only two jokes: one for a Scrooge-like Tim Allen, and the other for a Stalin-esque Dan Aykroyd. The perfect movie to watch if you can only get over the writing, the acting, the plot, and the grim realization that you have contributed to financing Tim Allen's career.",Christmas with the Kranks

261,butterflykissesforalways,A late night looser,3,15 December 2005,"I would recommend, Christmas with the Kranks, is viewed by only people who are looking for a brainless movie to watch late at night, because it doesn't have any extraordinary aspects to it, and because it has no thought provoking values. Furthermore, the acting in very elementary and easy to follow so serves as easy watch. On the day of November 27, 2005, at 3:30 pm I watched this movie twice through, in my living room, at my house in Bells Flats. This gives me the information and background to be able to review this movie. By saying a movie is brainless I mean that it doesn't take any brain power before, after or during the movie. Watching the movie is like watching a soap opera, the story line is straight forward, so the mind is at easy watching it. This movie is basically shot with a wide angle standard lens the entire film. The camera plays no tricks on your eyes and is pretty much straight forward. The scenes are not abstract in anyway. They incorporate no tilt effects or panning effects that make the eye cautious in watching. Most of the scenes are evenly lit and give no suspenseful play to the movie. No special features are brought in such as masking, or a hidden item, that would add any sort of depth to the film. These aspects of film weighted it, it allows for easy watching. Nothing is suspenseful and your eyes become lazily satisfied with the scene. However, being so easy to watch, if it is late you might just fall asleep half way through it. In film some directors, make the audience guess what is going to happen next. Not in this film. Although there is a plot and a storyline the movie doesn't have the watcher on the edge of their seats asking, ""What is going to happen next?"" It doesn't engage the watcher mind. Therefore it is great for those people who have had a long day and don't really want to engage themselves. Those people also tend to be the people who don't have a long attention span at night, and this movie won't help that. The acting in this movie proves to be very elementary. The main characters have no up's and down's to their personalities. They have their semi-freak-out moments, but other than that their characters are dry. Not very engaging the characters become normal human beings on screen and are not hard to watch or follow. Not true for all of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allan's movies, but very true for this one. They didn't give the extra humph that the comedy in this movie needed and therefore the film became dry and a half a laugh movie at most. For those people on a late Friday night this movie maybe in the stack coming home from Blockbuster, but for all those other viewers, there are better choices to be considered for a laugh out loud sort of movie.",Christmas with the Kranks

It's definitely not in the league of It's a Wonderful Life, but it certainly bats in the same ballpark as National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, which currently boasts a more appropriate 7.2 stars.Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis both give great performances in this movie. As the empty-nested parents of departing Blair Krank, they show typical-but-humorous reactions to the pending holiday absence of their 23-year-old daughter. Many American households could resemble that of the Kranks as the baby birds begin to take wing. It's easy to understand how the departure of your children can have a huge impact on the celebration of Christmas traditions.While it is true that the movie doesn't pull any punches, we should all know from the onset that the conflict in this movie is about a middle-aged couple attempting to escape the traditional capitalist trappings of Christmas. And, obviously, there is going to be a change of plans as well as a change of heart as Luther's Christmas cruise ship scheme unravels with the unexpected return of their daughter and her new boyfriend.There are many funny moments in the movie as the Kranks try to avoid the Christmas rituals of their neighbors, co-workers, friends and community. The unwanted Christmas carolers and coping with the effects of Luther's botox injections are just two scenes that come to my mind. But, even after the Kranks decide to host their annual yuletide celebration, the laughs continue as Mrs. Krank contends with the unmentionable honey ham debacle and Mr. Krank tries unsuccessfully to mount Frosty on the roof.My entire family loves this movie. We have watched it several times both before and after Christmas. My kids and my wife laugh every time. To its credit, the movie is not an embarrassment for parents with young children, which entitles it to at least 5 measly stars.We have a good time watching Christmas with the Kranks, which is all I expect from this movie. I would not ever describe it as a Christmas classic, but I can recommend it as a happy holiday diversion. Apparently, there are many people who expect a great deal more from a fun-filled Christmas movie.",Christmas with the Kranks
264,jmhenry850,Christmas with the Kranks-absolutely awful,1,19 November 2005,"What a waste of film, money, time etc...I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. I'm only laughing at myself for paying money to see it. I'm very disappointed-I had high hopes to add this to my Christmas collection of movies such as (Christmas Vacation, Elf, A Christmas Story). I like Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, but they should have known how awful this was during the making and refused to be a part of it. ""Boycotting Christmas"" yet hanging a wreathe on the front door, the ""Free Frosty"" garbage. Rolling around on their living room floor like commando and hiding under a blanket because ""people"" are wanting ""Frosty"". None of it was believable, I couldn't get a feel for any of the characters, and I didn't like any of them either. I'm not blaming the actors so much for the bad movie, but the writer instead.Maybe a refresher course in film-making would be appropriate.",Christmas with the Kranks
265,killianferrel,Christmas with the Kranks is as Inviting as it Sounds,1,2 December 2005,"If ever one wishes to be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas, one must first garnish large sums of regret by spending any amount of time and money at a local theater watching Christmas with the Kranks. Secondly, one should tempt the fates with an audacious act of self-loathing by purchasing this movie, exceptionally devoid of any depth or merit, as a staple for a family's holiday video collection. Lastly, one then stunts the development of youthful innocence by exposing his or her children to Christmas with the Kranks and immediately explaining to them how the movie is an adult's shallow interpretation of the holidays as a forewarning to never grow up.Pinnacle Talents:Christmas with the Kranks is the film adaptation of author John Grisham's novel ""Skipping Christmas"" adapted by Chris Columbus (writer of Nine Months), directed by Joe Roth (director of American Sweethearts) and starring Tim Allen (Santa Clause), Jamie Lee Curtis (True Lies) and Dan Aykroyd (Driving Miss Daisy).Plot in a Nutshell:Tired of succumbing to the commercialism of Christmas at home, Luther Krank (Allen) convinces his reluctant wife Nora (Curtis) to take a cruise during the holidays since their daughter Blair (played by the forgettable Julie Gonzalo) will be away in the Peace Corps. Unfortunately for Luther, his coworkers and neighbors consider him the proverbial Scrooge for not participating in festive traditions or buying into annual commodities. This results in the Kranks taking drastic measures to avoid most everyone they know until early December 24th when the doting parents learn that Blair is returning home with her new fiancée for a surprise visit and to experience Christmas with all the opulence the Kranks feverishly worked so hard to avoid.Film Impressions:The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had promise. The concept of a suburban Grinch, though a century-old cliché at best, would have been humorous to watch if the plot demanded the slapstick comedy found in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, the dark humor of Bad Santa, the endearing magic of The Santa Clause, or the solemn morals of It's A Wonderful Life. Unfortunately, this is another case of a movie with an underdeveloped plot forced towards a conclusion without any regard for potential or polish.For instance, the Chicago neighbors are made so ridiculously obnoxious that audiences can't help but sympathize with the Kranks. If by the end of the movie Luther and Nora took on the sadistic roles of Mickey and Mallory in Natural Born Killers and terminated everyone around them in a flurry of gunfire it would have been a welcome relief.The only neighbor that is written without any nuances is Bev Scheel (played by Elizabeth Franz) who suffers from cancer. This fact does absolutely nothing for the plot save to draw in the reins and bring the movie to its obvious ending.Jamie Lee Curtis screams and retreats in nearly every scene, Tim Allen takes a Botox joke well beyond the boundaries of funny, a criminal aspect is shown that should have been edited from the script, a nonsensical last minute bit of wonderment as to whether Santa Claus is real is included, and a two second appearance by David L. Lander (Squiggy of Laverne and Shirley fame) that fails to flourish into anything more than a quick glimpse of entertainment history among many other things makes this movie pale in comparison to other holiday classics save for a dusty lump of coal.",Christmas with the Kranks
266,hannahmarrin,I liked this movie,8,27 December 2005,"I saw the movie Christmas with the Kranks for the first time in theatres. I now own it. I really liked it. It was a light, funny, laid back movie. I don't know why so many people disliked it. I think that you have to have a certain sense of humor to think it was funny. I thought the plot was very entertaining and yes heartwarming. What's wrong with a heartwarming movie about spreading Christmas joy. Why is it so unrealistic? Is it really impossible anymore for people to be nice to one another? To be thoughtful. I think this movie portrays the values of enjoying the little things and simple things in life and perhaps this is why people automatically think this movie is dumb because they don't enjoy and embrace the little things and therefore they are quick to say these certain situations are unrealistic. All movies are a little unrealistic. So what. Like lord of the rings is realistic? come on folks. lighten up.",Christmas with the Kranks
267,unixguru10,Ishtar is no longer the worst movie ever! This is!,1,2 January 2006,"I am sorry, I can not recommend this movie. Don't pay to see it, Don't rent it, Don't buy the DVD or VHS Tape. I saw it so you don't have to.Jamie Lee Curtis does not do herself justice. Tim Allen is completely not believable in his role. How they got the funding to finance this movie is beyond me. Also the actors that were in the movie were of high caliber! I am wondering if the studios had to blackmail them to get them to star in this movie.This movie will never be a classic. As bad as ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" was, It will never amount to the only at midnight only movie status. Maybe someone will enjoy it if they have had one or ten too many drinks.Save your time and money and see something else.",Christmas with the Kranks
268,foursfine,Occasional moments of slapstick relieve the monotony,2,7 January 2006,"The only reason I didn't walk out on this movie was that I watched it on an airplane flight. I am still reeling over the shock of how much Jamie Lee Curtis has aged. She has completely lost what little attractiveness she once had. Obviously she used her fathers ""old boys network"" in the picture business to get this part otherwise no one would willingly waste film on her. Staring at her face and cellulite turned this movie into a horror film. For the love of God woman, don't show us what you look like in your underwear! No one could possibly believe Curtis was the mother of cutie Julie Gonzalo. Too bad Gonzalo cannot act other than portraying her actual bubble head self. Does anyone else feel that Tim Allen looks like he just finished serving 25 years hard labour for murder? Tim, please stay out of comedy as you look so scary that you aren't funny any longer. Cheech Marin was no funnier than a circus clown - he is a generation behind the times. Cheech man, please save what little dignity you have left and stay out of film from now on. Tom Poston is his usual psychotic self except older and even more senile. Dan Akroyd should have quit 15 years ago - why does he still want to torture us with his horrid acting?. I am still upset I paid $1 for headphones to see this bomb. Clearly a film that stars washed up has-beens who are clearly not going to ever make a comeback. Don't spend one cent or one second on this disaster.",Christmas with the Kranks
269,pureblackheart,Spoiler-don't watch this movie,1,18 December 2018,"John Grisham's book, Skipping Christmas, was mediocre in my opinion. The pacing was horrible, and the plot was overdone. Roth managed to fix none of this and still create more problems. It's like Roth was a firefighter who runs into a gas station on fire to try to put out the fire - and then realizes he has a flamethrower instead of a hose. So, yeah - horrible. And it had so much potential. With talent like Tim Allen (Luther), Jamie Lee Curtis (Nora), and others, and a big budget and a talented director, this movie could've been an Avengers, but it ended up being Batman v. Superman. Go watch The Santa Clause. A much better Christmas title also starring Tim Allen.",Christmas with the Kranks
270,vjboomer-73554,"Not ""objectively awful""",10,27 December 2018,"I was just perusing sites about movies. One mentioned ""Hollywood's Best Thanksgiving Films"" (I think). However, they described ""Kranks"" as ""objectively awful"". Change that to ""subjectively awful"", as the more perceptive among us rate this classic up there with ""Home Alone"", ""Christmas in Connecticut"", ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", ""One Magic Christmas"" and other holiday gems! Many, many laughs and even some tears. (It always amazes and disturbs me when, after being utterly amused and wonderfully entertained by a great movie, I find the inevitable trashy ""review"", usually from a troller.) If you ""don't get"" ""Christmas With the Kranks"", it's gone over your head, and you need to be visited by Marley's ghosts. Then, watch it again with your newfound heart, sanity and sensitivity. ""Kranks"" will rise higher on your list.",Christmas with the Kranks
