0,MartinHafer,It makes you want to leave the theater and step in front of a bus!,6,22 February 2016,"""The Cider House Rules"" is a very well-crafted film. The acting is generally quite good, the music terrific and the story interesting...though also depressing as can be and a bit repellent. The story is set in two places--at a god-awful orphanage and at an orchard nearby.When the story begins, you learn from the Doctor (Michael Caine) that little Homer was adopted and returned twice...and so the Doctor has raised him himself and taught this teen to be a doctor. And so, in this world of ""makin' your own rules"", he has the young man deliver babies and even observe abortions...though Homer thinks abortions are wrong. Of course, you KNOW that this will come back to haunt him later...after he leaves the orphanage to inexplicably become an apple-picker. Dying kids who cannot breathe, abortions, abandoned babies, incest and murder---this film is the ultimate in awfulness. Enjoyable it clearly is not...though the film did win two Oscars. One, oddly, was for Michael Caine. While I love Caine, in this film his accent was just bizarre...yet he got the award. I assume it was like John Wayne's win for ""True Grit""...not one of his best performances but given more for his body of work than anything else. I could see the film's technical merits but found it about as enjoyable as chewing on glass.",The Cider House Rules
1,SnoopyStyle,soft poetry takes darker turns,7,21 May 2021,"Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) runs an orphanage located at the isolated train stop St. Cloud's, Maine. Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) was twice rejected in adoptions and grows up to be Larch's apprentice. Larch teaches him everything including performing abortions but he disagrees on abortions. Everybody loves him. In 1943, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) come for an abortion. Homer decides to leave the orphanage with them to everyone's chagrin including Dr. Larch. He works at their apple farm staying in their Cider House with the seasonal workers. Wally goes off to war. Candy and Homer start an affair together. Dr. Larch is setting up for Homer to return as the new doctor in the orphanage as Larch fakes all the medical credentials even without Homer's approval.The movie floats through many points and many themes in this story. The movie opens with a slow but interesting orphanage story. When Homer leaves the orphanage, the movie diffuses the attention between him and back at the orphanage. It is still interesting but the movie loses some of the little intensity. The romance lacks a certain heat. I don't think Tobey Maguire is a particularly good romantic lead. The story does have a nice slow burn. It's a fascinating dark poetic feel that keeps pulling back the audience. It takes some dark turns. The movie is based on a novel. Like many of these adaptations, it's a tough thing to squeeze a large book into a much shorter form.",The Cider House Rules
2,Prismark10,You princes of Maine,8,10 December 2015,"If you loved the book then you might be disappointed by the film adaptation of The Cider House Rules done by the author John Irving himself.Irving condenses the time-span and gets rid of many of the novel's subplots.Dr Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) runs an orphanage of abandoned children in an isolated New England town of St Cloud. He raises orphan Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) as his medical apprentice after he was twice rejected by adoptive parents.Under Larch's supervision he is in essence an unqualified doctor. Wells also reluctantly performs abortions. Larch carries out the abortions because the alternative for the women is much worse with dangerous backstreet abortions.In 1943, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) come for an abortion, Wally is a soldier. Homer is unable to serve in the war because of his weak heart decided he wants to experience the world and leaves with them even though he is popular at the orphanage and Dr Larch treats him like a son.Homer works at the Worthington's apple farm staying in their Cider House with the seasonal workers who are mainly black and illiterate. The workers never realised the rules posted in the Cider House as no one told them about it or explained it to them. They certainly could not read it.Wally goes off to war and soon Candy and Homer begin a passionate affair. Back at the orphanage the staff hope he will return soon he regularly writes letters to them. Dr Larch sets up fake qualifications in order to pave way for Homer's return as the new doctor in the orphanage one day.The film has a central theme about rules and how they are set and made to follow by those who do not realise that if the people who the rules are for can read them, understand them or know what purpose they are for. This applies to the Cider House rules which is presumably for the worker's safety and the rules against abortion which is more biblical.Surrounding these issues we have the unwanted kids at the orphanage and the love given to them by Dr Larch and his staff who try to shield them away in this remote part of Maine from the big bad world as best they could. It helps that the kids are sweet, some get adopted, some stay until they grow old enough. A few die because their health is not strong enough.The film goes to and fro from the orphanage to Homer as he enjoys his life at the orchard and his illicit affair with Candy. He also gets mixed up with the dramas of the workers as one of the women has an unwanted pregnancy. However things take a turn when Wally returns from action paralysed and Dr Larch's health worsens and Homer feels the need to return to the orphanage.The film is a sweet tale with dark themes which can blind side you with the scenes involving the young kids watching King Kong. It is a film of Homer being protected from the world and discovering it himself the good and the bad.Caine gives a strong performance as the kindly Dr Larch. An actor who was never good at accents but gives a good New England flavour here. He won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Tobey Maguire is also excellent as the sweet natured, naive but principled Homer who has the urge to become adventurous.The film has been much shorn from the novel but is also the sweeter for it.",The Cider House Rules
3,lee_eisenberg,this cider house really does rule,9,30 August 2006,"""The Cider House Rules"" was the first of several movies in which Tobey Maguire played someone searching for his place in the world (the others were ""Wonder Boys"" and the ""Spider-Man"" movies). He does a top-notch job as a young man raised in an orphanage and now trying to get a better understanding of the outside world. The whole movie really gives one the feeling of New England, with the crisp air and all. Also great in their roles are Charlize Theron as an acquaintance, Paul Rudd as her husband, and Michael Caine (who won Best Supporting Actor) as the man running the orphanage.What's really amazing is that the original author John Irving - who also wrote ""The World According to Garp"" - actually adapted the book to the screen, and even won an Oscar for it (the pro-abortion content drew protests from anti-abortion groups when he won). All in all, a great movie. Also starring Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, Erykah Badu, Kieran Culkin, Kate Nelligan, J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man's boss) and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle"").",The Cider House Rules
4,jboothmillard,The Cider House Rules,10,11 July 2005,"I first saw this film in an R.E. (religious education) lesson, and seeing it again I realise how good it was, based on the novel by John Irving (who did the screenplay) from director Lasse Hallström. Basically Homer Wells is an orphan, and since childhood has been raised by, and become the favourite of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sir Michael Caine). Growing up, Homer (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire) gained medical knowledge and learnt the service of abortion (illegal). But Homer yearns to make his own life away from the orphanage, so when couple Wally Worthington (Friends' Paul Rudd) and pregnant Candy Kendall (Monster's Charlize Theron) come along, he hitches a ride with them to start his own life. Wally goes off to war, and Homer starts working for Arthur Rose (Ransom's Delroy Lindo) picking apples, for eating and cider (explains the title, the cider house has rules the workers have to obey). After being very good friends, Homer and Candy eventually give into temptation and fall for each other without anyone knowing. Homer's new life crumbles though when he gets involved with other people's problems, e.g. he finds out Arthur is abusing his own daughter, and he performs Candy's abortion. In the end, after the death of Dr. Larch he decides to leave Candy, when Wally comes back, and go home to the orphanage to be the new manager. Also starring Jane Alexander as Nurse Edna, Kathy Baker as Nurse Angela, Kieran Culkin (Macaulay's brother) as Buster, Kate Nelligan as Olive Worthington and J.K. Simmons as Ray Kendall. The story is very compelling, the acting is great, particularly from Caine, and Theron is gorgeous, especially her arse. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Director for Lasse Hallström, Best Editing, Best Music for Rachel Portman and Best Picture, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Sir Michael Caine was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Outstanding!",The Cider House Rules
5,moonspinner55,"Supremely icky at the outset, the film does eventually manage to be absorbing and moving...",6,12 August 2007,"John Irving won an Oscar for adapting his own novel to the screen concerning a New England orphanage in the early 1940s that houses as its caretaker an ether-addicted general practitioner (and sometime abortionist) who takes one orphaned lad under his wing and turns him into a first-rate medical assistant. As the years progress, the young man grows weary of being a part of a profession second-hand and travels to a neighboring town to work in an apple orchard. Coming-of-age story with an episodic dramatic structure starts to work after most of the orphanage-preliminaries are blessedly out of the way (Irving and director Lasse Hallström, two jaded souls, go surprisingly heavy on the sick-child and snowball-fight scenes), and the casting is terrific. Michael Caine, who won a Supporting Oscar, isn't a wily eccentric or a fanciful dreamer; he's playing a deeply troubled man with conflicting views of the world, rebellious against the law but also a realist with flagging energy. As his protégé, Tobey Maguire overcomes the obviousness of his role and handles the latter portions (where he's front and center) exceptionally well. Maguire is given some difficult scenes to play, and he carries them off without being showy (his solemn face and calming manner are mature and yet boyish, but never gregarious). As a dimpled, honey-dewed soldier's sweetheart, Charlize Theron has an even more cookie-cutter role to fill, but she does just what is needed and looks beautiful to boot. There are some bummer scenes such as Maguire's speech on the docks about the futility of making decisions and an incest/murder plot-thread that takes up time on the clock. Worse, there's a bit of impatience in waiting for this circular story to do its thing (with the passing of the torch and so on); yet, the film is carefully mounted for a moving pay-off, and only true curmudgeons would fail to be stirred emotionally by that finale. **1/2 from ****",The Cider House Rules
6,Quinoa1984,Reccomended,8,30 April 2000,"The Cider House Rules is a nice old fashioned movie that works OK, but this is not in my top 10 (maybe top 20).  The reason it works is because it has a good (and Oscar winning) screenplay by John Irving, from his novel.  And the actors work well together, including Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, and in his 3rd Oscar on, Michael Caine as the ether addicted doctor in a orphanage (his performance was good, but I feel Michael Clarke Duncan or Haley Joel Osment were more deserving for best actor).  It has a nice sprawling story and is very likable, but maybe It' s a little too soft. Good entertainment nevertheless.  A-",The Cider House Rules
7,michaelRokeefe,Sometimes you must break rules to straighten the situation.,8,23 March 2000,"This movie will be looked at from many different views. I forgot about race and religion and watched a very good movie about the human condition. John Irving did the screenplay of his own novel. A young boy, played by Tobey Maguire, is born and raised in an orphanage. He is taught the ways of childbirth and abortion by the headmaster, Dr. Larch, played by Michael Caine. The young boy wants to be more useful in life and goes on his own way to end up working in an apple orchard and learning about lobster fishing.The Maguire boy/man character fights with his own morals and lack of worldliness as the movie progresses. The predictable ending probably couldn't have been any better. Life happens. Bad things often happen to good people. This movie does question your thoughts of humanity.I found raw emotion, humor and tenderness in this movie. The story is set in Maine; but actually filmed in Vermont and Connecticut too. Scenery is awesome. Maguire's timid, monotone character does take some getting used to. Caine was very good. Charlize Theron proved that not only is she beautiful, but she can act as well. Erykah Badu did extremely well in a small, but important role. This movie is worthy of its many Oscar nominations.",The Cider House Rules
8,sunwarrior13,It Is All About Choices We Make,10,28 October 2011,"The Cider House Rules is a film based on John Irving's novel of the same title.The film stars Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells;Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch;Charlize Theron as Candy Kendall;Paul Rudd as Lt. Wally Worthington; Delroy Lindo as Arthur Rose; and Erykah Badu as Rose Rose.It was written by the author,John Irving himself; and directed by Lasse Hallström.The film touches on themes such as humanism,abortion and incest.The story is about Homer,who is an orphan in remote St. Cloud, Maine. Never adopted,he becomes the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch, who imparts his full medical knowledge on Homer,who becomes a skilled but clearly and unschooled and unlicensed physician. But Homer yearns for a self-chosen life outside the orphanage. When Wally and pregnant Candy visit the orphanage Dr. Larch provides medically safe as well as illegal abortion,Homer decides leaves with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. Wally goes off to war, leaving Homer and Candy alone together. While Wally is away, Homer and Candy have an affair. Later, Wally's plane is shot down and he is paralyzed from the waist down.When he returns home, Candy takes care of him and leaves Homer.While he is away from the orphanage,Homer lives on the Worthington estate. He goes to work picking apples with Arthur Rose's team. Arthur and his team are migrant workers who are employed seasonally at the orchard by the Worthingtons. Mr. Rose impregnates his own daughter,and Homer,who disapproves of abortions, realizes that in Rose's case, he must perform one for her. Later, when Arthur makes another amorous advance toward his daughter, she stabs him, and as a last request, the dying Arthur asks the other workers to tell the police that his death was a suicide. Eventually Homer decides to return to the orphanage after Dr. Larch's death from inhaling an ether overdose, and works as the new director.The performances of the cast were great.Special mention goes to Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron.But most of all,Michael Caine truly deserves the his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Dr.Lurch.No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards as the story and the cast were flawless in this movie.The movie has managed to capture many themes as it blends romance with the love of children, the warmth of family with the darker side of human nature, and the all-encompassing belief that everything has a purpose.Aside from that,it is also controversial in the sense that it touches on topics such as incest,suicide,adultery and abortion.But overall,it was all about the decisions we make in life.That is why this movie works as it remained focus and single-minded from beginning to end.No wonder that Irving won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.Overall,this film is one great film that would truly allow a viewer to give a deep introspection on the choices we make and the effects and consequences it brings into our life.The Cider House Rules is definitely highly recommended for everyone who wants an extraordinary film.",The Cider House Rules
9,Doylenf,"Charming rural landscapes, old-fashioned charm, and morality tale...",7,16 September 2006,"TOBEY MAGUIRE is really the heart and soul of this moving story about a boy's coming of age, his troubled young manhood and then his decision to return to the orphanage where Dr. Wilbur Larch (MICHAEL CAINE) rules everything with an iron hand and a warm heart. It's the kind of story Charles Dickens would have loved and depressing at times.Maguire's taste of freedom (which results when he leaves the orphanage, has a brief affair with CHARLIZE THERON) and becomes mired in a sub-plot involving abortion and incest, is all dramatized with sensitivity that gives the whole story a very poignant flavor. The crisp color photography of New England during various seasons is also a plus factor.If you're looking for a warm-hearted tale of intense character relationships that moves at a rather leisurely pace (and has the feel of a Merchant-Ivory film at times), this is your ticket. MICHAEL CAINE truly deserved his Supporting Role Oscar.Highly recommended.",The Cider House Rules
10,preppy-3,"Funny, moving, incredibly well-done",8,27 December 1999,"I didn't think it was possible, but one of John Irving's most difficult books was condensed by the author himself (the last third of the book is gone) into a very very good movie.  All the acting is great (especially the nice low key performances by Macguire and Caine), BEAUTIFULLY shot (in Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts), a score that fits the movie like a glove and fully realized three-dimensional characters.  Plot-wise there's nothing new (young man goes out to see the world, discovers himself, etc etc) but the cast makes it seem new.  They all find depth in roles that have been done before--especially Caine who speaks with a very convincing Maine accent!  Bring lots of tissues with you--the movie is sad and disturbing at points (all kept in the PG-13 rating however), but it has a happy ending. Well worth seeing.  See it on a BIG screen--all the beautiful shoots won't work on TV.",The Cider House Rules
11,view_and_review,Weak Sauce,2,25 December 2020,"I was half in half out with this movie from about the point Homer (Toby Maguire) left the orphanage. I was about three quarters of the way checked out when Homer started sleeping with the girlfriend (Charlize Theron) of the WWII pilot (Paul Rudd) who took him in. That love story could be seen coming from the next galaxy away. I was 100% checked out when the poor little Black field hand, Rose (Erykah Badhu), got knocked up by her father (Delroy Lindo). It was already a disgusting and unnecessary part of the movie except to make Mary Sue Theron more angelic because of her intense concern for the help and to make Homer more of a hero because he stood up to Daddy Daughter Doer.Take your saccharine, cheap, poor, attempts at white aggrandizement at the expense of poor dumb Black people and shove it down someone else's throat.",The Cider House Rules
12,evanston_dad,"Tasteful, inoffensive and bland",6,29 July 2021,"Tasteful, inoffensive and bland, ""The Cider House Rules"" was director Lasse Hallstrom's bid at prestige in 1999, and he was rewarded with Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture.Tobey Maguire plays a young man who learns about life by pining after the girl of his dreams (Charlize Theron) and through his friendship with a benevolent abortionist (Michael Caine). Maguire has exactly one facial expression as an actor (big-eyed dopiness), Theron looks lovely, and Caine brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.The film skitters quickly away from the story's darker terrain (including abortion and incest) and prefers instead to linger on images of pretty New England scenery, glossy as a magazine cover.Grade: C+",The Cider House Rules
13,anaconda-40658,Cider House Ruled Out a Decent Screenwriter.,2,16 September 2015,"The Cider House Rules (1999): Dir: Lasse Hallstrom / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd: Boring drivel staged as an art film. Too many disjointed subplots, none of which regard those stupid Cider House rules so the title functions on absolutely nothing. Tobey Maguire was raised in an orphanage by an abortionist played by Michael Caine. When a couple arrive for an abortion Maguire travels to the Cider House where he will pick apples and have sex with Charlize Theron while her husband is off to war. A real yawner with three pointless deaths that present nothing to the movie. There is a knife guy that is suddenly written out of the story. The incest factor leaves more questions than answers. Does any of this garbage matter? Director Lasse Hallstrom is backed with fine production. Maguire is miscast as this apple picking playboy who will ultimately make a controversial decision. Theron is there for no other purpose other than to sleep with Maguire then feel guilty when her husband turns up injured as oppose to dead. Caine begins well then witnesses pointless death scenes. Delroy Lindo is wasted as another apple picker. Paul Rudd has the misfortune of playing Theron's cuckold husband who was risking his life while she spread her legs. Its appeal depends on one's view of abortion. Overrated mess that should be aborted with a shotgun blast. Score: 2 / 10",The Cider House Rules
14,HotToastyRag,Beautiful and moving story and performances,10,27 November 2017,"The Cider House Rules is a beautiful, beautiful film. Based on John Irving's novel, it's set in the years before WWII, as a boy who's spent his entire life in an orphanage chooses to explore the outside world. It's extremely difficult to sum up the story, or even to describe central themes, because this film means so many different things to different people. For some, it's about the relationship with between a father and son, how the father tries to impart his wisdom, and how the son wants to forge his own path. For others, it's a story of youth and maturity. Others still will look at it as a historical film preserving a way of life that doesn't exist anymore.While it lost the Oscar in 2000 for Best Picture to American Beauty, it won gold statues for Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor; the latter was a highly competitive contest, including Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. I'll leave it to you to decide which extremely talented performance deserved the award that year, but if I had my way, I'd have given a two-way tie, plus a special award for Outstanding Juvenile Performance. If you read the book of The Cider House Rules, you'll see that Michael Caine's character is actually the lead in the story, but in the long, complicated process of turning his novel into a screenplay, John Irving made the focus of the story Tobey Maguire's journey. Michael Caine is still the heart and soul of the film; his lines are the most memorable long after you leave the theater, and his scenes inspire the most tears.Tobey Maguire, who was not even nominated that year, also completely embodies his role. He's raw and emotional, mature in some ways but completely inexperienced in others. It's truly exhausting to watch this film, because as Tobey lives through his imprinting experiences, his face shows every hurt.Lasse Hallstrom, whose films are sometimes a little more sweet than serious, gives incredible love and care to his direction. The colors are beautiful, paying tribute to New England, and the scene transitions are smooth, paying tribute to the time period in which the film is set. He compiled a star-studded supporting cast, all of whom are authentic and full of emotion: Paul Rudd, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander, Kate Nelligan, Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, and J.K. Simmons. Charlize Theron plays the love interest, and while I don't happen to like her as an actress, she doesn't really detract from the film too much. There's so much more to love, so whenever I watch it, I concentrate on the other cast members, the poignant and heart-wrenching script, beautiful music, and lovely scenery.I watched the film before reading the novel, and as much as I absolutely love the book, I recommend watching the film first. The novel spans decades, and if you read it first, you'll probably be disappointed that certain plot points and characters are cut out. The book starts decades before the film, and continues decades after the ending. However, watching the film first allows you to fall in love with the story and then learn more about it. I love both versions of The Cider House Rules, even though it inspires buckets of tears every time I watch and read it. It's so incredibly lovely, and it's so rare that this degree of near-perfection is reached.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult subject matter, a rather intense sex scene, and scenes of abortion, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",The Cider House Rules
15,Wuchakk,Beauty and the beast in Maine during WWII,7,22 September 2018,"On the surface ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999) is a quality period piece about life at an apple orchard and orphanage in Maine during WWII. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, who was raised at a remote orphanage and favored by caretaker Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who imparts his vast medical knowledge & skills to the young man. At the age of 21 Homer decides to leave the orphanage with a couple that stopped by for an illegal abortion and ends up working at an apple orchard. Will he ever return?It's the subtext where the film soars for those interested in ruminations on the complexities of morality and the place that outward or inward rules play.Here's a taste: The movie contrasts outer rules with innate moral rules. The former can be broken as it suits the individual without any ill-effects, like the cider house rules in the film or stepping over the wall at Niagara Falls to get a better picture; innate moral rules, however, cannot be broken without severe consequences. To illustrate, the apple workers rightly mock the cider house rules made by people who don't know what it's like to live & work there, but one laborer breaks a universal spiritual law and so loses a close relationship and something worse, which conveys the idea that ""the wages of sin is death.""Another example involves the rules of society demanding that a person have proper credentials in order to do the work Dr. Larch performs, and understandably so, but official credentials on a wall are irrelevant in regards to some people, like Homer, who's thoroughly expert at his craft, credentials or no credentials. And so Larch creates fake ""proper"" credentials to appease officials and patients.Also, Wally & Candy (Paul Rudd & Charlize Theron) impulsively have an illegal abortion at the beginning of the movie but, by the end, it doesn't look like they're going to have very wild sex anymore (which is different than saying they won't have any sexual relations). They no doubt strongly regret deciding to break the rules and have an abortion, which was illegal at the time.Obviously the movie's not far Left or far Right; it's somewhere in the middle in its realistic reflections on moral complexities and ambiguities. Both sides of the abortion debate, for instance, are presented. And, while it could be argued that the movie somewhat supports the pro-choice position, it doesn't neglect to convey the conservative view and effectively shows how the debate is more complex than black or white. For example, if a man forces his self on a woman and she gets pregnant, the life within her is not there by her choice and therefore she arguably has the right to abort that life with the blood of the child being on the head of the impregnating male.Elsewhere, Homer argues the conservative position, suggesting that people should be responsible enough to control themselves BEFORE a woman is impregnated and the ugly issue of abortion rears its head. Dr. Larch later remarks that he wishes the world were as idealistic as Homer sees it, but instead we're stuck with an intricately phukked up planet where people make wrong choices all the time, which have a negative domino effect.The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in Northampton, Massachusetts (orphanage); Dummerston, Vermont (orchard); Bernard, Corea and Sand Beach, Maine; as well as surrounding New England locations.GRADE: B+",The Cider House Rules
16,JamesHitchcock,"A Warm, Rosy, Nostalgic Film about Abortion, Drug Addiction, Infidelity, Suicide, Incest and Death.",5,3 July 2007,"""The Cider House Rules"" tells the story of Homer Wells, a young man born in an orphanage in a remote part of Maine. As Homer grows up, he is virtually adopted as a son by Dr Wilbur Larch, the doctor in charge of the orphanage, who trains Homer to become his assistant, even though Homer has no medical qualifications. Eventually, Homer moves away to work on an apple farm and as a lobster fisherman. Homer's motives for leaving the orphanage are twofold. Firstly, he wants to see the world outside the small town where he grew up. Secondly, he has moral scruples about the fact that Dr Larch, whom he otherwise respects, is carrying out abortions which were unlawful at the time. (The story is set in the early 1940s).The film has aroused some controversy because of its position on the abortion issue. Dr Larch is a strong believer in the right of women to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Homer (himself an unwanted child, who is uncomfortable with the idea that he might have been killed before his birth in order to suit someone's convenience) initially serves as the voice of the anti-abortion school of thought, but later, while working on the farm, he reverses his position and agrees to perform an abortion on a young woman who has become pregnant through an incestuous relationship with her own father. (We are asked to believe that, although he has never been to medical school, he has become a highly skilled surgeon as a result of assisting Dr Larch).The film's title is taken from a list of rules which are hanging up in the ""cider house"", the building where apples are made into cider and which also serves as a dormitory for the farm's migrant workers. Although some of these rules, such as the one about not smoking in bed and the one about not operating machinery while drunk, seem eminently sensible, they are resented by the workforce on the grounds that they have had no hand in making the rules. Eventually, the list is ceremoniously thrown into the fire.One of the key lines in the film is ""Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right."" This piece of cracker-barrel wisdom is actually spoken by the man responsible for violating his own daughter, which must cast some doubt on his status as a moral philosopher. I doubt if John Irving intended his moral libertarianism to extend as far as the rules forbidding incest, but he seems to want to apply it to just about every other ethical question raised in the course of the film, not merely to the abortion debate.Both main characters carry out actions which, from a moral point of view, are highly questionable. Larch falsifies Homer's medical records (without his knowledge) to enable him to avoid military service during World War II. Later, he forges a number of documents which purport to show that Homer is a qualified surgeon, hoping to get him appointed as his successor at the orphanage. Homer is initially reluctant to go along with Larch's deceptions, but later allows himself to be appointed as the orphanage doctor after Larch's death. (He dies as a result of becoming addicted to the ether he uses in operations). He also has an affair with a friend's fiancée while that friend is away on military service. Irving (who wrote the screenplay from his own novel) and director Lasse Hallstrom, however, try to pass all these matters off as being morally justifiable, shrugging any moral issues aside with ""Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right,"" a sentiment which in the circumstances seems inadequate.Michael Caine has spent most of his film career playing Englishmen; there are occasional exceptions, such as his German sergeant in ""The Eagle Has Landed"", but the only other film in which I recall him playing an American was ""Hurry Sundown"" from the late sixties. I will leave comment on his accent to those who are more familiar with Maine than I (I have only visited the state once, and that only briefly), but I felt that his was the best acting performance in the film. For all his faults, Larch is basically a kindly man, deeply attached to the children in his care, and Caine brought this out well. I was less impressed with Tobey Maguire as Homer. As a result of Larch's falsifications, Homer believes himself to have a heart condition and that he must avoid too much excitement. Maguire, however, seems to have interpreted this as meaning that Homer must never show any emotion at all, and his performance seems lifeless and wooden.The film has an attractive neo-classical musical score from Rachel Portman, and is photographed to show the Maine countryside in all its beauty (although, as with a number of other films set in New England, I did find myself wondering why it nearly always seems to be autumn). The film's visual beauty, however, is part of what is wrong with it. There is a serious disconnect between its visual style and its sombre themes. From what I have seen of his work, Hallstrom has always struck me as an overrated director, and ""The Cider House Rules"" reminded me of another of his films, ""Chocolat"", in which he also uses lush, sumptuous visuals to disguise some highly questionable philosophising. Here, he manages the remarkable feat of bathing in a warm, rosy, nostalgic glow a film whose themes are abortion, drug addiction, sexual infidelity, suicide, incest and death. 5/10",The Cider House Rules
17,=G=,An ample helping of the warm and fuzzies.,8,16 August 2000,"Part of the charm of ""Cider House Rules"", a coming-of-age movie with Tobey Maguire at the center, is the finesse with which it presents itself as a ""feel good"" movie when most of the characters have precious little to feel good about. The film could easily have had a harder edge to it. However, the makers of this carefully crafted film tiptoe so adroitly around such issues as abortion, murder, infidelity, and incest as to leave the audience with an ample helping of the warm and fuzzies. The film deserves high marks for enjoyability and for bringing back the charm of Hollywood's golden years.",The Cider House Rules
18,sddavis63,Dull Adaptation of John Irving's Novel,3,3 March 2001,"Not every good book should be turned into a movie. ""The Cider House Rules"" is a classic example of that rule. Tobey Maguire plays Homer Wells in this story of a young man raised in an orphanage desperately searching for his identity and his destiny. I have to confess that from a personal point of view, that was the first problem with the movie. Maguire, to me at least, is not a first rate actor. He's not bad, but lacks the power to be a lead actor. The same applies in this movie. Maguire is OK, but not great. Michael Caine offers a good performance as Dr. Wilbur Larch, the operator of the orphanage Wells was raised in, but he doesn't have enough of a presence in this movie to make a huge impact. Charlize Theron was good as Candy, Homer's love interest, but it was hardly a role that stretched her talents. The best performance, in what to me became the most interesting of the several sub-plots in the movie, was offered by Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, who, as the head of the apple-picking team, teaches Homer everything there is to know about apples.The problem with the movie wasn't with the individual performances. They were all - I'll say it again - OK. It's just that I really didn't think that the cast meshed all that well as a team (in particular, Theron and Maguire just aren't a credible couple.) On top of that they were burdened with a dull, slow-moving script that seemed to take forever to get going. The movie picks up in the last half-hour or so, but only to a crawl, and the end is completely predictable. How this ever got nominated for an Academy Award is completely beyond me. I give it 3/10.",The Cider House Rules
19,ElMaruecan82,An uneven pacing and a Maguire's performance prevented the film from being the masterpiece it should have been...,7,4 September 2019,"There's something so soothing and comforting in Michael Caine's voice and so few movies set in an orphanage that when Lasse Hallström's ""The Cider House Rules"" began, I found myself immediately absorbed by St. Clouds serene atmosphere, to the point I was about to turn off the lights and really go to sleep when Dr. Larch uttered his unforgettable ""Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England"". This is how powerful Caine's Oscar-winning performance is. This is a man who dedicated his life for his ""children"", providing them the love and caring they didn't and couldn't get, making them feel precious, not important but precious.I'm making the film sappier than what it is, the kids actually joke about the ""good night"" catchphrase, their cuteness isn't overplayed although the sight of a pre-Dewey Erik Per Sullivan playing a severely ill child broke my heart, but the film has life in it, in fact, the film is about life, so much about life that it also handles the difficult subject of abortion, but I'll get back to it. It's important to mention the prologue because it is really a winner part. We're taken into this orphanage, we see the good hearts who populate them, the two loving nurses (Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker), the kids who grew there (Kieran Culkin is particularly moving) and of course Homer Wells, who was rejected by his first adoptive family because he didn't cry, and was taken back by Larch because the second family made his cry too much. According to Larch, he was born to stay an orphan and grow up in St. Clouds.Being an orphan is a tough existential ordeal to begin life with, many children give their best smile to visiting couples because it's one thing to be loved by the doctor and the nurses, but kids crave from a more exclusive form of love, since they didn't even have it in the first place. It's so difficult being an orphan that some rational minds would put it in equation with the film's main subject: abortion, which Larch practice, with the young Homer as his assistant. Larch doesn't play God as much as acts like his assistant, fixing men's mistakes and preventing the losses of two lives instead of two, and the film reminds of the pains and struggles of couples or lonely women going through 'illegitimate' pregnancies in the 1940s. It doesn't advocate it but offers a fine balance of views, especially with Homer being reluctant to such practices, despite his competence and his routine consisting of throwing a jar's content in a furnace.The film has the tact to take a firm stance on the issue without trivializing it, and it's a credit to John Irving's adaptation of his own novel. But there's something of a catch in all these well-handled aspects, there's a moment where Homer meets a couple played by Paul Rudd, as a young army Captain, dashingly handsome in his pre-""Friends"" years, and a no-less beautiful Charlize Theron, they come for the obvious reason but their presence triggers a sudden desire for Homer to leave the orphanage. I understood the motive, a man his age would want to see the world and not having it framed by the chaperoning of a father-figure who wants to pass the torch. However, I didn't want the film to leave the place, it was such a perfect expositional start with so many endearing characters that the rest could only depend on Maguire's screen-presence, and while the actor did a decent job, his character wasn't engaging enough.Maguire founds a strange note to play his Homer, he has a sort of monotonous or laconic voice (was he trying to channel Forrest Gump or Sling Blade?) but then it appears that's the way he is, which is fine, but then it makes harder to believe that such a boy would have that magnetism operating with a character like Theron's. There's a romantic subplot that anyone would see coming, but while Theron plays the perfect touch of sweetness, Maguire makes it difficult to believe he deserves it despite his obvious boyish charm. I could understand why Larch would have that affectionate patience with him, he's the child he never had, but even Rudd's character is so nice to him I was under the impression he regarded him as a harmless child-like man. It's interesting to have a character like this in the lead but somewhat it didn't fit with the mood the movie put me into at first, with Caine's narration.To put it simply, I'm not sure I enjoyed the ""apple picking"" and ""cider house"" part as much as I was supposed to. That part introduces us to interesting characters, especially the veteran picker Mr. Rose, played by Delroy Lindo and his daughter Rose (Erykah Badu). Obviously the part was intended as the meat of the film, dealing with these so-called rules no one paid attention to, the romance growing between Maguire and Theron but I found these part hard to connect to each other. Even the climactic abortion in the third act, playing as a catalyst for Wells' final life decision (again the 'life' issue), wasn't handled in a satisfying way, it was actually disturbing that the closest character to an antagonist was offered a kind of redemption as if what he did wrong was ever forgivable. That such a brave film could weaken at the part where it was supposed to be the strongest left me with a slight disappointment.I understand it's difficult to adapt a novel, especially if the book is a doorstopper, but while Irving did a fin job for the most part (he won the Oscar), his story is so rich and multi-layered that it needed more discipline in the structure and maybe a more engaging actor to play the lead, at least as powerful as Caine, who was extraordinary.",The Cider House Rules
20,paul2001sw-1,Watered-down cider,6,6 April 2003,"""The Cider House Rules"" is an earnest, polished and ultimately muted movie that ambles along agreeably but with little real purpose.  Tobey Maguire's character doesn't know what he wants, so he leaves his sheltered life in search of some experience, which he duly gets: but he never really has enough at stake to add real dramatic tension to this movie.  While Michael Caine's Oscar must have been more of a lifetime achievement award, his performance is competent but it is impossible to believe that an unknown would have been given such a prize for a relatively straightforward part. In conclusion, a slight disappointment from a director who has done better work (notably ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") before.",The Cider House Rules
21,ThomasDrufke,"You Go Where You're Needed, Not Where You Need to Go",7,19 June 2019,"I have a soft spot for a few of Lasse Hallstrom's movies. Sometimes critiqued as overly sentimental, Hallstrom often finds a way into my heart with human stories built around tragic tales. The Cider House Rules contains what may be Tobey Maguire's best work, and gave Michael Caine his second Oscar. The performances are clearly the strong point of the film, which story feels a bit dated in 2019 and doesn't hold together for 2 hours all that well. With that said, the first and third act are pretty poignant, as it tells a story of a man searching for his true calling, only to find that it was right there in front of him the whole time.7.3/10",The Cider House Rules
22,g-bodyl,"Emotional, Plot-Driven Story!",9,10 March 2014,"The Cider House Rules has seen it's share of controversy mainly because of it's take on abortion. I am against abortion myself, so I was able to connect more with the main character. But this film is an old-fashioned tale of a young man wanting to explore the world and fall in love. This drama is one of those films that made the 1990's an exemplary decade in film because it's this genre that defined the 1990's in my opinion.Lasse Hallstrom's film is about a young man named Homer Wells who grew up in the orphanage under the guidance of Dr. Larch. But Homer decides a life as a doctor is not for him, so decides to go out and explore the world. Out in the world, he becomes an apple picker and happens to fall in love with the beautiful Candy.One of the strengths of the film is the display of acting. This film has a strong ensemble led by Tobey Maguire and the very good Michael Caine. In strong supporting roles, we have great performances by Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd, and especially Delroy Lindo.Overall, this film is a strong growing-up tale and a good way to close out the decade. This is a passion project by screenwriter John Irving and it shows by a very sentimental script. The film has a good, old-fashioned look to it takes to beautiful cinematography and skilled editing. A very fine drama indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",The Cider House Rules
23,lesleyharris30,"A Nice, Classical Feel with Solid Performances,",8,6 August 2017,"The Cider House Rules is a great movie with a well developed plot and a very talented cast. It is a very hard hitting movie that deals with some very surreal themes. As we follow Homer Wells leave the orphanage that he spent his whole life in, we get to experience a young, naive man seeing the world for the first time, and being put in to his shoes in such an effective way by the writer and director makes it feel like it is our first time as well. I have to agree with the late great Roger Ebert in saying that this movie has far too many sub plots that is barely gets a chance to touch on several of them. I understand that it is based on a book that had all these stories, which works out fine for a novel, with a movie, however, it would have been far easier to cut it down to under five stories that could fit in to a two hour gap effectively. The cast is phenomenal from beginning to end, Tobey Maguire delivers a rich, layered performance, and his chemistry with Charlize Theron makes for an effective on screen relationship that is without a doubt one of the movies highlights. Michael Caine delivers one of his most versatile performances to date in this role, playing a loud, well spoken Amerocan, he showcases his range and takes home an Academy Award for this role, which he could not deserve more. Slow moving plot that is a pleasure to watch unfold. Well written with top notch performances, The Cider House Rules is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. A young medic clashes with his mentor at the orphanage where he was raised and takes a job on a cider farm. Best Performance: Michael Caine",The Cider House Rules
24,vincentlynch-moonoi,"Uncomfortable topic for some, but a brilliant film",8,16 March 2015,"I've never gone to a movie BECAUSE Michael Caine was in, though I have gone to quite a few movies that Michael happened to be in. And it has always seemed to me that few A-list actors have so frequently been in awful movies AND been in so many top notch movies. So, I guess you could say I tolerated Michael Caine in films. But with this film, I came to truly appreciate his abilities.I had planned to go out with a woman friend to see ""American Beauty"", but when someone asked if I knew the premise of the film -- the desire for sex with an underage girl -- I changed our plans and we went to see ""The Cider House Rules""...which to my dismay turned out to be about abortion. I'm not sure that was a better film choice for a date movie.I have to admit that my liking of this movie has improved a great deal over the years. Abortion simply makes me uncomfortable. I'm politically pro-choice, but morally pro-life...although it's a difficult topic. But watching a movie like this shouldn't be about affirming or knocking down your political views, it should be about being absorbed in the story.Michael Caine is simply brilliant here. He's certainly not a beloved character in this film -- an abortionist (when needed) and addicted to ether -- but it's not about loving the character, it's about respecting the profession of acting. And so, Michael Caine -- A+.I'm also not a fan of Tobey Maguire, but again, I felt he was terrific in this film! It just seems as if Mr. McGuire needs to pick his roles very carefully.I have long thought that Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses out there...as well as, perhaps, the most beautiful. She doesn't disappoint here in either category.I believe this was the first film I ever saw Paul Rudd in, and he's quite good here, and usually.Delroy Lindo does a great job here in a role that is hardly a crowd pleaser. He's as close as this film gets to having a villain. Rose Erykah Badu is good as Rose.Two of my favorite character actresses are here as nurses -- Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker.Will you like this film? I think it depends on whether you get wrapped in the politics of abortion, or if you just want to see an excellent film, which is what this is.

Based on about a third of Irving's sprawling novel, this film lacks a sustained narrative flow, coming across as a series of scenes put together to promote an agenda. As such, the plot seems contrived, meandering, and preachy. Instead of the themes being integral to the story, it's more like the themes being the dots that are connected to form the story.

His direction was as good as in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" of 1993 and I believe that he succeeded for one more time on both presenting us the main characters of his movie and make us understand some of their choices. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I was amazed by the interpretation of Tobey Maguire who played as Homer Wells and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael Caine's who played as Dr. Wilbur Larch, Charlize Theron's who played as Candy Kendall and Delroy Lindo's who played as Mr. Rose.

Someday, you feel you can't be happier. The next, you lose everything. I think it the first movie that I saw where this profound truth about the meaning of life is told with such clarity!But the story is much: It ponders about what's feeling home, the parenthood, ""wrong"" romances, and the choices that had to be taken.The New-England locations are very beautiful and it gives life to an encapsulated settlement, where feelings take more weight. If Maguire is perfect in his gentle, naive character, I must recognize that Theron is indeed a great actress and that she doesn't steal her Oscar. Unlike Belluci who would stay forever a model, Theron shows great acting talent and doesn't rely only to her charisma! One memory of this movie would be the movie night at the Orphanage and especially the state of bliss of every one: they are mesmerized with wide-open eyes & mouth by ""King Kong"", and it was funny because I share the same reaction from any good movie, and this one belongs to that category!",The Cider House Rules
28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"With a strong story, ""The Cider House Rules"" has that intangible period piece magic",8,29 September 2012,"It's exactly not easy for a period film to feel magical, and this is something ""The Cider House Rules"" achieves almost instantly. No single element of the film feels completely original or totally inspired, but the entire package crafted by Lasse Hallstrom and John Irving has the fairy tale quality that Oscar contenders are made of.Component number one: the voice-over narration. Michael Caine, who plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, is a narrator comparable to Morgan Freeman in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and that's not a comparison to be drawn lightly. Caine's words (credit to the script noted) set the ideal tone for this kind of a drama, and the story of an orphan who grows up and longs to experience is its lucky recipient.Although his origin story comes in fairy tale fashion, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) isn't some child with a special gift or a misunderstood outcast; he's just seemingly fated to not find foster parents. Consequently, Dr. Larch takes Homer under his wing and trains him to be a doctor at St. Cloud, the obstetrics hospital/orphanage in middle-of-nowhere Maine where they all live.Life at St. Cloud is isolated to say the least, and as much as Homer enjoys being a role model to the boys there, he's not ready to just assume the mantle of doctor that Larch has prepared him for. The arrival of a young couple seeking an abortion (St. Cloud had a reputation for performing them illegally), World War II pilot Wally (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron), inspires Homer to see life beyond St. Cloud.The archetypes of ""The Cider House Rules"" seem all too familiar, but Homer isn't your typical clueless, naive young man whose world view gets him in trouble though he inspires. Instead, when you consider Homer's regular interactions with women and their anatomy, it's clear he's anything but prude. His sudden departure with Wally and Candy is not an act of rebellion, but of pure curiosity.There's a lot of Peter Parker in Maguire's performance, though to be fair ""Spider-Man"" came three years after ""Cider House."" Homer is almost foolishly self assured, and Maguire dials down the wide-eyed wonder you might expect from his character.If we're going to talk performance, however, it's Caine who takes the cake, and deserves his Oscar win. Larch is a loving father figure to Homer, overprotective at times and even hypocritical, a tad jocular and mischievous, but passionate about his work. As our elders so often do, he fails to recognize that Homer needs to experience the world in his own way, even if Larch's wisdom is worth being heeded.Homer's time as an apple-picker and lobster-wrangler seems far from an enviable existence, so it's tough to completely empathize with his choice to abandon St. Cloud, but his blossoming relationship with Candy provides the ultimate justification in love. Homer experiences the loss of innocence he never had in his time living in the cider house, whether it be learning from the workers who he lives with or discovering love through his intimate affair with Candy.During Homer's excursion, there's no question that something will call him back to St. Cloud. ""Cider House"" can't get away with hiding anything given its classic story structure and obvious tropes, but it can infuse everything with genuine emotion, and that's where it succeeds. In terms of original thinking, ""The Cider House Rules"" does explore notions of family. Whereas most films lean on traditional family values in terms of themes and eliciting emotion from the audience, there's a notion in ""Cider House"" that suggests that the biological notion of family isn't all it's cracked up to be, and in some cases can even be detrimental to our well-being. At the same time, Homer learns that role models — people who care about us wholeheartedly no matter our circumstances — are the real necessity. Even romance takes a back seat in this notion.Director Lasse Hallstrom presents this story in straight-forward fashion. His strength can be found in the way his style works so well in tandem with Rachel Portman's uplifting score. You could almost say that the tone of the movie dupes you into believing it's Oscar worthy, but because Irving provides such a solid story for the rest of the production, there's no trickery involved. ""The Cider House Rules"" is a triumph of writing to be certain.A pleasant drama aside from a few ""challenging"" moments, ""The Cider House Rules"" has that unmistakable quality of greatness, even in its predictability. It stands as testament to how the familiar can sometimes be a great thing.~Steven CThanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com",The Cider House Rules
29,freemantle_uk,A Coming of Age story,8,22 July 2008,"This film is a good coming of age story based on a novel John Irving, set from 1943 to 1945. It tells the story of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), who leaves the orphanage he grew up and works at an orchard.Homer was the orphan who the orphanage director Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) treated as a son and taught him to be a gynaecologist. Wilbur hopes that Homer could take his place and run the orphanage. However Homer feels that he needs to leave the orphanage, and having not seen the world outside it. He befriends a young couple and he falls in love with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron). He works on the family orchard befriends the seasonal workers. Wilbur thinks that Homer is better then that. At the same time their is a moral issue about abortion. Wilbur performs illegal abortions, thinking that its the right thing to do, but Homer is against it, believing that it isn't moral and a unborn child has a right for life. My personal view is that abortion should be legal because it is dangerous if it was illegal and just force it underground.I will said that this movie is not the greatest story and does sometimes go off the beaten track, but it makes up for it with its acting.

30,dfranzen70,"Thumbs-up to Caine, down to Maguire",8,9 April 2000,"John Irving's novel about the tribulations of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), a young man who lives all of his childhood in a relatively placid Maine orphanage, is in some ways a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, although it's nearly sunk by the rather bland, Forrest Gumpishness of its lead character. Homer Wells is given up by his natural parents as a baby, and for one reason or another is never adopted. Because of his long tenure at the orphanage, the home's good doctor (Michael Caine, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) teaches him how to be a doctor, and the two share many of the child-rearing duties at the orphanage. Assisted by Nurses Edna (Jane Alexander) and Angela (Kathy Baker), the duo perform countless deliveries of unwanted babies. There's a flip side to this issue, of course - the unwanted pregnancies that are aborted. Homer can't bring himself to perform the abortions, but Dr. Larch can. While the abortion issue isn't central to the plot of the movie, it is an integral piece to Homer's own coming-of-age. At some point, Homer must fly the coop and live life on his own, and here is where the comparisons to characters such as Forrest Gump or even Robin Williams' Garp come into play. Homer leaves the orphanage in due time, but he also leaves behind his family, including his fatherly superior, Dr. Larch, who loves the boy so much that he doesn't want him to go out into the world and be a failure when he knows Homer could stay at the orphanage and ""be useful."" This sweeping tale checks in at over 2 hours, but it's not a yawner by any stretch. Homer is forthright, honest, and above all respectful, all qualities sadly lacking in many people today. (Luckily, this film takes place in the first half of the 20th century, so those characteristics don't seem out of place.) Caine is amazing in his role, completely dropping his famous Cockney accent in favor of a stentorial New England dialect. Once you get past hearing him sound like an American, you'll be fine - but it's a little jarring at first. One could almost make an argument that Caine could have been up for Best Actor, but this is clearly a movie about Homer, not Dr. Larch.   As for Maguire.... Well, there's something to be said for subtle performances, to be sure, but there's also something to be said about underplaying a roll too much. Maguire simply is miscast. He's earnest, but there's not much expression to be read on his face. To put it succintly, he's more than underwhelming in the lead role. The antithesis of Maguire is the lovely and VERY talented Charlize Theron, a young woman who comes to the orphanage to have an abortion. Theron is stunning, but what really grabs you is her magnificent, moving, and endearing performance. This is an actress to keep your eyes on, ladies and gentlemen.

Various contrived conflicts keep the plot moving along in an episodic way. And thusly, the film could easily have been transferred to TV as a weekly miniseries. Mercifully, it wasn't.The film's theme I suppose is that, amid life's conflicts and problems, we all need rules to live by. But this lesson, rather self-evident to any five-year old child, and taught implicitly in kindergarten and Sunday School, is presented here in a way that reeks of sap and sentimentality.The story's adult characters are stereotyped. The little boys and girls at the orphanage really tug at your heartstrings. The manipulative score, heavy with orchestral strings, is annoyingly drippy. My impression, therefore, is that the film is aimed at viewers who can easily lose themselves in the emotions of the various pitiful characters. Further, the script's plot is awkwardly contrived. And the story's ending is so predictable you can see it coming the proverbial mile away.Casting and acting are marginally acceptable. But if Tobey Maguire had been any more somnolent he would have been comatose. The film's direction and color cinematography are bland and mediocre, totally unremarkable.""The Cider House Rules"" is the kind of film that Hollywood insiders dearly love: sweet and uplifting, a real feel-good movie heavy on manipulative emotionalism.

The North was just as segregated as the South, but it was merely de facto, rather than de jure. Delroy Lindo's character was oddly compelling, in spite of his abhorrent conduct.

Homer however wants to see the world. He leaves with a young couple and takes a job picking apples. What does his future hold, and will he ever return to St Cloud's ?Scripted by John Irving (who has a cameo as the stationmaster) from his novel, this is an evocative, charming and thought-provoking period-drama with a great cast, a highly original setting and skillful direction. The only thing I'd change about it is the pace - the first quarter with Caine in the orphanage is pure magic, but when it moves to the ménage à trois subplot it becomes a much more conventional love story; I'd have liked more of the former and less of the latter. The relationship between Homer and Dr Larch is much more interesting, and Homer's naivety, moral instincts and quiet unassuming nature make him a wonderful leading character. The movie is brilliantly cast - Maguire's subtle, soft-spoken portrayal of Homer is right on, and this Caine is superb, giving one of his very best performances (he won an Oscar, as did Irving), and all the children are terrific, particularly Culkin (Buster) and Diamond (Curly). Rachel Portman's score is wonderful, an exercise in heartfelt piano and strings, which is guaranteed to make even the stoniest heart break. This is a great humanitarian film, dealing with death, loss of innocence, unwanted pregnancies and unloved kids with great sensitivity and completely from the point of view of those affected. A fine bow in Swedish director Halström's distinguished career. Shot in lovely locations in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts. 6/10",The Cider House Rules
38,Spleen,A word about the analogy drawn by the title,7,30 July 2001,"The ""cider house rules"" are regulations posted on the wall of the shed in which the orchard workers live.  When Homer reads them out they turn out to be ridiculous, and other characters in the film helpfully make fun of them for us, just so that we notice how ridiculous they are.  Clearly the rules were posted by someone who didn't live in the shack and had no understanding of the lives of the people who did.  The metaphor is this: the rules represent the religious imperatives we are taught as children, imperatives ""posted"" by distant ancestors who don't have to live in our ""shed"", etc.There's a difference between expressive metaphors and didactic ones.  This is one of the latter.  Besides which, two things bother me:(1)  When we meet the owners of the orchard, the people (presumably) responsible for posting the cider house rules, they turn out to be intelligent, understanding, down-to-earth - not the priggish know-nothings capable of writing such things as ""do not sleep on the roof"".(2)  More importantly...  The ""cider house rule"" Homer learns to disregard is the one prohibiting abortion.  Why did he ever follow this rule in the first place?  Where did his disapproval come from?  No doubt his parents disapproved of abortion - if they hadn't he probably wouldn't have been born - but since he was raised from birth in an orphanage, the director of which for obvious reasons did NOT disapprove of abortion, it's not clear how he managed to inherit his parents' views.  Of course, Homer was free to disagree with his father figure and we don't even need to be told how he came to do so - except we ARE told, through the ""cider house rules"" metaphor, and what we're told is false.  Homer was not given ANY ""cider house rules"" at the start of his life.It makes a nice enough story without the metaphor, though - perhaps a trifle rambling, which is why we get the impression that someone, at some point, said, ""Quick, someone think of a moral.""  (Note that I haven't read the novel; IT may give an entirely different impression.)  Growing-up stories may be better if they naturally contain morals but they don't really need them.  This one is fine without.  The cinematic craftsmanship is pleasingly solid, and we care about the characters, and that's enough (in this case) to make a decent movie.",The Cider House Rules
39,doomedmac,A movie with a message,7,21 May 2021,"The House Cider Rules is a good movie with a great cast. It gets a little bogged down in the pro-abortion message, but the film as a whole is very solid.",The Cider House Rules
40,pc95,Well Handled and touching movie,7,1 July 2008,"The Cider House Rules is a well done movie that manages a pretty remarkable feat: it handles no less than 3 story-lines seamlessly while giving each enough substance. Often in the majority movies, the screenplay leaves loose ends or dead-ends a side-story to a flaw, but not here. The screenplay obviously has a lot of care and thought put into it - there is little pretentiousness or overcooked drama. There is simplicity and truth in feelings and dialog as well as character development, especially with Homer, the lead. There is a marvelous sense of continuity and effective breadth, especially considering the running time. Another thing going for it is excellent acting from support to leads - indicating competent direction and editing. Only real quibble would be the music and soundtrack which seem a bit clichéd if vanilla. Yet this doesn't really detract and is minor. Worth a watch surely",The Cider House Rules
41,philip_vanderveken,Thanks to Lasse Hallström this has become an enjoyable movie,7,26 July 2005,"""The Cider House Rules"" is one of those movies that I always wanted to see some day, but somehow never came to it. For some reason or another I thought I wouldn't like it all that much, despite the fact that it gets so many good comments from many reviewers. But when it was shown on television a couple of days ago, I decided to tape it and to finally watch it, so that once and for all I would know what this movie would be like.Homer Wells has grown up in an orphanage in a small and remote town where the only strangers that visit it, come to have an abortion, to give birth to an unwanted child or to adopt one. Homer was never adopted, but has become the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch, who has thought Homer everything he knew about medicine. Now Homer has become a skilled, but unlicensed physician who takes care of the other children and helps women giving birth. But he knows that there is more in life than the orphanage and he wants to see something of the outside world. When Wally and Candy visit the orphanage for an abortion, Homer leaves, much against Dr. Larch's will, with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. But soon after their arrival Wally has got to go back to the war in Asia (it's 1943), leaving Homer and Candy alone together. With a lot of problems on the farm and the loneliness that's never far away, they soon grow closer together...With a story like this one, this could easily have become a syrupy TV-movie, but Lasse Hallström has avoided that trap perfectly. Not that I expected otherwise. I've seen his ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""Chocolat"" before and I liked both movies, but even the best director can sometimes chose a completely wrong way of telling a story. But he hasn't, with his choice to make this movie emotional, but not extremely sentimental, he is able to keep a large audience interested. And even though the movie conveys a message about pro-abortion (which is fine by me, but which could cost him a lot of viewers), he never forces it down your throat. I guess that the fact that they have made doctor Larch pro-abortion and Homer Wells pro-life gives both sides a reason to like this movie.Next to the good story, this movie also has some very fine acting to offer. Tobey Maguire was very well casted as Homer Wells and his performance makes that not all attention is drawn towards him, but allows you to see the other people in the story as well. Charlize Theron also did well and made her role as the main character in a difficult romance look a lot better than what you might expect. Michael Caine's performance was OK as well, but it's Erykah Badu and Heavy D who surprised me the most. Both aren't exactly known as actors, but what they did in this movie was more than OK.Overall this is a good movie that could have gone wrong in many departments. It's probably only thanks to Hallström that it didn't happen. I liked the story as well as the acting, even though it isn't as perfect as some people say. Still, it's more than just worth a watch and that's why I give this movie arating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.",The Cider House Rules
42,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Well acted, but misguided as a whole.",6,18 May 2014,"I started The Cider House Rules once a long time ago. I couldn't stand the falseness of Michael Caine's American accent and it pushed me away from the film with a thirty foot pole. Round two of giving it a go, and only motivated by the fact it won an Oscar for its screen writing and I guess Caine's second Oscar, I was quite pleasantly surprised at first. It's much more cinematic and iconic than I expected, rather than being derivative of the sentimental scope of a film such as Forrest Gump. It wasn't necessarily great, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but that kings of maine line is familiar. I can't say that Caine deserved his award over Tom Cruise, Haley Joel Osment and Michael Clark Duncan, but it could have been a bigger crime.While it has a handful of potentially effective moments which is entirely down to the pleasant surprising conviction of its otherwise unsuspecting cast, it's all squashed in favour of a forced tearjerking attempt at sentimentality which results in an eye roll. The plot begins its windy path to nowhere and it feels terribly formless and unfocused, just a checklist of themes and scenes. The script has a relatively good sense of drama but the way certain things are approached feel nonsensical, especially when we're supposed to buy that Tobey Maguire would confront a big black man about an incestual relationship. I know story lines were cut, but it still feels too densely packed, like three movies in one. That doesn't make it three times as rewarding.6/10",The Cider House Rules
43,xredgarnetx,Expressive,6,10 October 2007,"CIDER HOUSE RULES, from a John Irving tale, is an eloquent if not totally satisfying yarn about a boy being raised by a doctor, played by Michael Caine, who takes in unwed mothers. The doctor also performs abortions as needed. The young man, played by Tobey ""Spiderman"" McGuire, eventually takes off with one of the young lasses to see how the rest of the world operates. When he returns to the doctor, nothing is the same. Caine is great, McGuire is McGuire, and the film sort of hangs there. Worth a look, but be prepared. It is an Irving story, after all. And a Lasse ""Shipping News"" Hallstrom movie. I have read several Iriving works and watched two or three film adaptations of his works. There is a perverseness to all of them that is different and more elusive than, say, the works of Kurt Vonnegut, another major 20th century writer and (very) roughly Irving's contemporary. Approach with caution.",The Cider House Rules
44,baumer,A very fine film,8,15 January 2000,"There are films that you see for the sheer velocity of them.  Then there are films that you see because you know that they will not be around at the theatre for very long.  Last year I saw a fine film called Something More that was a sweet film about the perils of dating in the 30 something age group.  It had a cast of relative unknowns but it looked, for lack of a better word, nice.  It was quite the film and after I saw it, it abruptly left the theater about a week later.  Cider House Rules may last longer than Something More, but not much.  It too is a sweet film that doesn't boast of a huge cast.  Let's face it, Tobey Maguire and Clarize Theron are not on the A-list of actors that can open a film.  Maguire is probably best known for his stint in Pleasantville and Theron is gorgeous and probably known maybe for her role in Mighty Joe Young.  Not huge hits by any stretch but together in this film they are wonderful.  Michael Caine is always terrific in almost every film he chooses ( we'll forgive him for Jaws 4 ) and here he even pulls off a Maine accent quite well.  But CHR is not the type of film that is going to make 100 million at the box office and bring in droves of people.  But what it is, is a great character study of one character named Homer Wells and it is also a story about finding out who you are, even if that means making mistakes.  After all, how are you supposed to learn if not by trial and error?  It is also a film that tells us that sometimes what we think we know isn't always the truth.  As one of the characters in Secret of My Success said, "" There are no right and wrongs, only opinions. ""The richness of the film stems from the screenplay, which was written by Irving himself, and the actors that portray his characters.  As I said, Tobey Maguire is a great young actor and you can see his ability shine through here.  He is not over the top in any of scenes and sometimes it may seem as though he is very comatose in certain scenes, but then you watch a bit more and realize that he is his character.  Homer Wells is exactly the way Maguire plays him.  He is always thinking, always wondering and always perhaps a step ahead of the other people in his life and Maguire's perfect interpretation of him is one of the best performances of the year.  I would love to see him get a nomination this year for best actor, but that is a tough field already.  Clarize Theron shows great range as well and Erika Badyhu is quite good as Rose Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose.  He is played by Delroy Lindo.  You may remember him from Ransom with Mel Gibson.  In this film he is perfect.  This is a man many layers to him.  At first you love him then you don't like him so much.  But that would be too easy.  I think the screenplay paints this man with many shades of gray.  And we are left to decide at the end of the film how we feel about him.  What I enjoyed most about the film was showing how people are people and that we all make mistakes.  The seduction of flesh and power of love are hard to ignore, no matter how loyal you may feel to one person.  It's funny, in some ways I can draw parallels to this film and Magnolia.  Both try to tell us that human beings are fragile and mistake prone.  We all sin and perhaps we all have to pay for those sins somehow.  But the difference between this film and the obnoxious, smash mouth Magnolia is that this says it in a way that doesn't annoy us or make us want to rip the projector out and set it a blaze.  Magnolia made me angry, Cider House Rules touched me and made me happy.  It made me think a great deal as I left the theater.  It also showed me that it is okay to make mistakes.  We all do, it's what you do to rectify the situation that counts.  Cider House Rules won't be in the theaters for very long but it is one film that should be seen.  You'll be glad that you did.",The Cider House Rules

47,gftbiloxi,A Superior Soaper,8,3 June 2005,"Conservatives, Fundamentalist Christians, and Pro-Lifers will automatically dislike THE CIDER HOUSE RULES on principle. Although such individuals may couch their criticism in terms of script, actors, and production values, the cause for their dislike is the film's highly existentialistic tone re personal values, its pro-choice stance re abortion, and the fairly compelling argument it makes in favor of that position. Set during World War II, CIDER HOUSE is the story of a child named Homer(Tobey Maguire) raised in a Maine orphanage by stubborn but likable Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who trains Homer in medical arts. As Homer comes of age, however, he becomes increasingly unhappy with Dr. Larch's tight grip and extremely displeased with the fact that Dr. Larch also casually provides safe but highly illegal abortions to women who demand them. Consequently, Toby sets off to see the world--and finds himself working in an apple orchard, where he lives in ""the cider house"" with black seasonal farm workers.There is a great deal to recommend this film. Although Tobey Maguire sometimes overplays the innocence of the character, his performance of the unworldly Homer is generally effective; the real stars of the film, however, are Michael Caine, who brings remarkable humanity to the difficult role of Dr. Larch, and Charlize Theron, with whom Homer falls in love. The supporting cast--which includes Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and Erykah Badu--is quite fine. The cinematography is remarkably beautiful, and although not necessarily memorable in terms of dialogue the script is quite effective.Still, the film tends to rely more upon mood than upon actual substance, and as such becomes increasingly predictable as the action progresses, and most viewers will know how the story will end by the time they reach the film's midway point; it also has a very leisurely feel that some viewers will read as slow. Although it forms the crux of the conflict between Homer and Dr. Larch, the issue of abortion is never really fully explored and is presented in a rather one-sided (although very effective) manner. Those expecting an intense, fast-paced drama will be disappointed, and as previously noted pro-life viewers will despise the film from the word go; even so, and in spite of its occasional failings, most viewers will find it thought-provoking, extremely touching, and quite memorable.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Cider House Rules
48,jhclues,Memorable Film From Lasse Hallstrom,10,20 February 2001,"The boundaries of our lives sometimes seem self-ordained, while at other times they seem predetermined by a higher power, and life itself often becomes a quest to ascertain which is which.  And so it was with a young man who grew up an orphan in the State of Maine, in the years preceding World War II, in `The Cider House Rules,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom.  Under the tutelage and watchful eye of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the administrator of the orphanage in which Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) had lived his whole life, Homer, by 1943, had become quite knowledgeable and adept in the field of medicine.  What he lacked, however, was the formal education that would have enabled him to practice what he had learned, if indeed, he had so desired; which in fact he had not.  The orphanage was a world unto itself, a loving haven for unwanted children, but a place apart; and a larger world loomed just beyond it's perimeter, a world Homer Wells wanted to see.  And when circumstances present Homer with an opportunity to get away, he grabs it, and embarks upon his journey of discovery, much to the consternation of the good Dr. Larch, who fears that he has lost Homer-- whom he loves as a son-- to the world forever.  And forever is a long, long time. 	Hallstrom presents the story with acuity and care, drawing upon the innate humanity of the characters--especially Dr. Larch and Homer-- to bring it all to life.  While Dr. Larch epitomizes the benevolent nature of man, one who has known the world and has come into his own, has found the place from which he can do some good, Homer represents the longings of youth; no longer a boy, but a man who must discover on his own what Dr. Larch already knows. And, as it is in real life, it becomes a matter of experience; and though fate ultimately intervenes with a nudge in the right direction, it is Homer who decides the direction his own life will take-- it is he who finally realizes what is meant to be.  And under Hallstrom's steady and skillful hand, the journey becomes, not only Homer's, but the viewer's as well, as he mines the emotional depths of the characters, making them people with whom the audience will be readily able to identify. 	Affecting an American accent for the first time in his career, Michael Caine gives a performance that deservedly earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  He brings Dr. Larch so vividly to life, capturing the deep concern and humanity of the man, while conveying his sincerity and exposing his vulnerability; it's a complete and real portrayal, enriched with nuance and altogether memorable.  As good as Caine is, however, the film clearly belongs to Maguire, who gives a masterfully understated performance as Homer.  There is such expression in the pacific nature he lends to the character, along with a sense of mature acceptance that serve to accentuate his inner yearnings, that make Homer so believable, a person with whom it is easy to sympathize and relate.  There is something of a wistful poet beneath his stoic, though gentle, outward appearance that makes him endearing.  With a subtle ability, Maguire makes it clear that Homer is a person of intrinsic good, and it gives not only the character, but the performance, a ring of truth and integrity.  It's exceptional work, and taken in conjunction with his turns in `The Ice Storm' and `Wonder Boys,' firmly establishes Maguire as one of the best young actors in the business today. 	The extraordinary supporting cast includes Delroy Lindo (Mr. Rose), Charlize Theron (Candy), Paul Rudd (Wally), Jane Alexander (Nurse Edna), Kathy Baker (Nurse Angela), Kieran Culkin (Buster), Kate Nelligan (Olive Worthington), K. Todd Freeman (Muddy), Erykah Badu (Rose Rose) and Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy).  Highlighted by outstanding performances and the sensitive interpretation and delivery of the story by Hallstrom, `The Cider House Rules' is a touching excursion into the depths of human emotions, and a taste of what life is all about.  More than just a film, it's an experience; one that will create a lasting impression on your soul, and one that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.",The Cider House Rules

He decides to leave and find his own way in life and accepts a job from a young woman (Charlez Theron) who has an abortion at the surgery.

Tobey Maguire is superb as is Charlez Theron and Delroy Lindo but suprisingly the acadamy award went to Michael Caine. Caine is good but i was slightly put off by the accent he was trying to do. Why didnt he just use his normal accent?

50,gbheron,One of 1999's Best,10,25 February 2001,"""Cider House Rules"" is the best translation of a novel to film that I've ever seen. It must help that the novelist adapts his own work and writes the screenplay. This novel is a large, complex work with many characters and sub-plots. It would have been easy for the screenwriter to become bogged down in details and losing their way. Irving doesn't. He grabs at the major thematic thread and defines an engrossing tale of growing up and discovering one's self and one's calling. Set in rural Maine during World War II we follow Homer Wells, adolescent ward of an orphanage run by Dr. Larch. Visually it's a dark foreboding place, put emotionally full of love and happiness, excepting the sad women who trek to the orphanage to unburden themselves of their pregnancies, either by adoption or (illegal) abortion. Dr. Larch helps with both. Dr. Larch has also provided Homer with an education in practical obstetrics that would be the envy of any medical school. I don't want to go on further with the plot, it's a sweeping tale told with great acting, camera work, and scoring.What worries me about this near perfect film is that my views are colored by having first read the novel.  The characters and locations in the movie are exactly as I visualized them. It's spooky. And this provides me with information to fill in gaps about the character's motives and drives.

This film was nominated for 7 Oscars for the 1999 season, winning 2 - including a 2nd BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR OSCAR for a veteran actor. It is based on a wonderful novel and features 3 young actors well before they became stars.Sound interesting? Then check out THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.Based on the novel by John Irving, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES follows the life of Homer Wells (a pre-SPIDERMAN Tobey Maguire), a young orphan who is raised/mentored by the head of his Orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). When Homer decides to leave the orphanage and experience the world, he learns quite a bit about life including THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.This is one of those ""coming of age/follow a person through their life""-type films that relies heavily on style, substance and the performance of the actors on the screen. And under the Direction of Swedish Director Lasse Hallstrom and with words of the Screenplay by the author of the novel, John Irving, and with terrific actors like Maguire and Caine (amongst others) speaking those lines - a spell is cast and a heartwarming, life-affirming experience unfolds.Caine won his 2nd Oscar for his role as Dr. Larch. This is a complex character who has his own, very certain, views on the world and is uncompromising in his care for others. It is a wonderful performance - even taking into account the peculiar Maine/United States accent Caine puts on. His character's empathy, strength and vulnerability are at play throughout this performance and he is a very deserving recipient of the Oscar.A very young Charlize Theron and a (then) unknown Paul Rudd are engaging, charming and extremely photogenic as a young couple that Homer leaves the orphanage to see the world with. Rudd is the embodiment of the ""nice guy"" in this film - you can see the seeds of a career of playing ""the nice guy"" in this performance. Theron radiates beauty, power and a self-reliance that shows the strong actress she will become. While Homer's relationship with Dr. Larch is the heart and conflict of this film, the trio of McGuire/Theron/Rudd are the soul. The film also features a bevy of strong character actors in smaller roles that prop this film up. Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, J.K. Simmons, Kate Nelligan and Delroy Lindo all shine in smaller roles - as do some of the child actors that portray other orphans like Keiran Caulkin and (especially) Per Erik Sullivan as the physically compromised Fuzzy.But...none of this works if Maguire doesn't hold this film together (for we see this world/film through his eyes and he is in every scene) and he brings it. He has a quiet charm and innocence that helps bring us into his world in a welcoming way. Certainly, the awkwardness that Homer shows around Theron will be in evidence when he plays Peter Parker years later, but it is the inner strength that Maguire shows that really makes this character shine.John Irving wrote the screen play based on his novel - and the results are satisfying, both to those who've never read the book (or have encountered an Irving novel/book before) or veteran readers/lovers of Irving's work (like myself).All of this is wrapped in a package by Director Lasse Hallstrom (MY LIFE AS A DOG) in a charming, loving way that show the people, events and times through a lens that amplifies the proceedings in a way that is welcoming and engaging.It is always a bit of a concern of mine to revisit a film that I remember fondly, but in this case, I am glad I jumped at the chance to revisit this charming film.And you'll be glad you did, too.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Cider House Rules

That overall resulted in a film that there's no right demography for. I wonder whether John Irving's novel itself is muddled like this or is it the screenplay, also written John Irving, intentionally glossed over said themes in order to match Hallström's sweet-natured direction, which I have no problem with to be clear. One last issue I have, I think the first 15-20 minutes are slightly overly-expository, unfocused and jumpy, and therefore it took me a while to be invested in the story.However, I think I liked it a little. I was quite invested in the character of Homer Wells as I mentioned but other than that, I think all all the performances are great: Paul Rudd really surprised me in this dramatic role; Michael Caine is great as ever even if I still believe Tom Cruise deserved the Oscar for best supporting role in Magnolia more than him; Charlize Theron really brought her character to life; and Tobey Maguire delivered one of his best performances to say the least.

Dr. Larch in his strange eccentric way believes that although the boy has not studied at a University he has gained all the necessary knowledge through him and is thus well-equipped for the job.There is a happy atmosphere about the orphanage because of the devoted staff. There are sad moments when couples arrive to adopt a child. There are cries of ""Take me!"" and ""I am the best!"" as children see a good future when adopted into a new family.

Some tissues may be needed at times in the story.Dr. Larch is quite shaken when Homer decides to leave the orphanage and seek his fortune elsewhere. He does everything he can to stop him, but Homer is determined and ends up as a casual worker picking apples in a fruit orchard. The cider house where the pickers bunk up each night has rules but they argue they are not meant to be kept because the person who wrote them does not sleep there. Homer breaks a cardinal rule when he has an affair with the proprietor's wife. Another casual picker has sex with his daughter so predictably Homer steps in when the distraught daughter becomes pregnant.One of the loveliest scenes in the film is Homer's welcome back to the orphanage when Dr. Larch dies. An interesting scene prior to this is Dr. Larch's meeting with the Medical Board where he shrewdly uses a psychological approach to get Homer appointed.It's a very absorbing drama, predictable at times, but always interesting particularly when the ether-sniffing Dr. Larch is concerned. Toby Maguire renders a good performance as the simple orphan Homer who has never seen the sea nor a lobster and who Dr. Larch would firmly agree was a Prince of Maine.",The Cider House Rules
58,FlickJunkie-2,Poignant and powerful,10,19 August 2000,"Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last year, this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant, exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are ordinary people struggling with problems we all face. We come to have affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or hope. From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of What's Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom, working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to do enough development of each character (often just visually without any dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right combination of idealism, naiveté and inner strength to make him an unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness, she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary career spanning close to half a century. He has long been one of my favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character; egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly, self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",The Cider House Rules

60,khatcher-2,"Well-balanced, delicious story-telling",8,2 September 2001,"Beautifully told and photographed story with a wonderful cast. Even Michael Caine had to do a bit more than just appear to be a British Gentleman, and despite his accent failing at rather frequent intervals, this must be one of the best rôles I have seen him in. And from Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron down to the apple-pickers and the kids in the orphanage we have some fine performances, masterfully conducted by Lasse Hallström. Rachel Portman's score is also excellent.John Irving's own screenplay from his novel, together with Hallström's superb directing combine to make a very pleasurable couple of hours which is rather more than just entertainment: together they manage to convey more characteriology in whispered tones than anybody else I can think of at the moment. This film has some of the best dialogues I have heard for a long time. My second viewing of this film was even more profitable than the first: many more little nuances became manifest, especially some of the characterization by the `lesser' members of the cast  like Erik Per Sullivan, Spencer Diamond and Erikah Badu, for example. Oliver Stapleton's filming is right up to the mark: just simply beautiful.However, certain observations made by many people that this film is just a bare-faced apologia in favour of abortions just do not do justice to either Irving's or Hallström's intellectual capacities: in neither case can they be cheapened to such unworthy comment. Or is it that today people have forgotten that the ravages of poverty in the aftermath of world war left hundreds of thousands of children in orphanages of all kinds, both in the USA and in the UK  as well as other countries? Just how many children  undesired or unwanted  arrived in an unkind world? I can remember my time in an orphanage in S.E. London in the early fifties.",The Cider House Rules
61,MichaelMargetis,"""Goodnight, you princes of Maine. You kings of New England. "" - Dr. Wilbur Larch",8,29 October 2005,"'The Cider House Rules' is a great heart-warming kind of picture that was one of the best films of 1999. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer, a young man who grew up his whole life in an orphanage under the care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (the fabulous Michael Caine). When a WWII veteran (Paul Rudd) and his beautiful wife (Charlize Theron) come into the orphanage to get an abortion performed by Larch and Homer, Homer decides to leave the orphanage for the first time to go out and see the world. Homer leaves with Theron and Rudd where he works on Rudd's parent's farm picking apples under the supervision of Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his team of apple pickers including his bright and interesting daughter Rose (Erekah Badu). The film shows how Homer learns what the world and people are like outside the orphanage and how he deals with it. Tobey Maguire gives a wonderful performance as the lead role, while Charlize Theron is solid in her role (before her turn in Patty Jenkin's 'Monster', when we all discovered what a truly magnificent actress she really was). Delroy Lindo gets a chance to exercise his dramatic abilities as Mr. Rose, and he does a fantastic job with it. Michael Caine is only in the film for perhaps a combination of 25 minutes, but in those minutes he steals the film from every other actor on screen with his breathtaking and beautifully-crafted performance that won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that very year. Lasse Hallstrom does a nice job directing and the film is smoothly adapted onto the screen from it's original theatrical play format. The movie also stars Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander as nurses working under Caine's Dr. Wilbur Larch. If you haven't already and don't mind a semi-sappy but very good film, consider renting 'Cider House Rules' sometime at the videostore. Grade: B+",The Cider House Rules

Well I was delightfully surprised by a delightful story and superb acting job by the whole cast. I thought the acting job by Michael Caine was great and he certainly should have been awarded the Best Supporting Actor award, justly deserved. Tobey Maguire is a new face to me, but for a newcomer he certainly did a fine job of acting. Look forward to more work from this young man. What can I say about Charlize Theron, she is a beautiful woman who can act as well. If there is a movie that will move you better than The Cider House Rules I would like to hear the name. Go get the DVD of this outstanding movie, you will certainly enjoy.",The Cider House Rules
63,AKS-6,Another great film by Lasse Hallström,8,9 March 2000,"""The Cider House Rules"" hasn't exactly been praised here in Sweden -- rather the opposite. So when I went to the cinema today I didn't expect much even though I really like Lasse Hallström's films; especially ""Mitt liv som hund/""My Life as a Dog"". There's something very special about Hallström's tone and mode and even though ""The Cider House Rules"" is more Hollywood than his earlier films (only natural since most of his films are Swedish) I still felt what I usually feel when watching a Hallström film: quietly entertained, if you see what I mean.Michael Caine was brilliant, I hope he wins the Academy Award this year. And okay, so I have a thing for Tobey Maguire I really, really like him, but most of the reviews I have read have said that he's barely able to change his facial expression which I think is unfair: he manages to convey Homer's feelings without going to extremes, I thought he was great. As for the rest of the cast: they did a good job. I'm quite impressed by Erykah Badu who seems to be one of those multi-talented people; not only is she a great singer, she's also a good actress.So, I really liked this film; I liked the acting, the directing, the cinematography and the score. Definitely an 8 (out of 10).",The Cider House Rules
64,Angeneer,This is a miss,7,23 January 2004,"It is not clear as to what this movie's point is, to boost the pro-choice agenda, to describe the life at an orphanage or to explore a teenager's blossoming. As I see it, it fails at all of them. It is too soft and moralistic, full of cliches and obligatory scenes. Moreover it proves beyond any doubt that Tobey Maguire can't lead. Charlize Theron might be the most gorgeous actress on the earth today (and she has a naked scene that will drive all her fans crazy), but still her role is too vague and superficial. Michael Caine on the other hand is by far the redeeming value of the movie. He is pure class.",The Cider House Rules
65,chrisbrown6453,"With more women visiting the orphanage to have abortions or to abandon their babies than to adopt one of the many children available, The Cider House Rules --set in the early 1940s-- comments on the problems",7,9 July 2001,"The Cider House Rules, directed by Lasse Hallstrom and based on the novel (as well as written for the screen) by John Irving, explores the world of Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the director, obstetrician and abortionist of St. Cloud's orphanage. Although Wilbur develops a strong paternal bond with all of the children, The Cider House Rules examines his special dedication toward Homer Wells, a baby boy who, after proving to be ""un-adoptable"", remains under his tutelage. Throughout the years, Homer (Tobey Maguire) learns about the philosophy behind Wilbur's profession, while resisting the idea of adopting the same. The plot evolves as Homer leaves Wilbur and the orphanage, finds employment in a cider-producing plant, and a new home in the Cider House. Here Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), fiancée of the Cider House owner's son, and a pregnant ""Rose Rose"" (Erykah Badu) force Homer to revisit the philosophies of the distant Dr. Larch.Aside from the good humor and the delicate sympathy with which The Cider House Rules portrays its characters and their situations, the film delivers reasonable pro-choice arguments, which state that: 1) ""in order to allow the opportunity of being a good parent, the choice of being parents to begin with should be allowed as well""; and 2) ""If those who are qualified don't perform the abortion, others will"". Most importantly, The Cider House Rules is successful in supporting these arguments by approaching --subtly, yet sensibly-- the dilemmas which envelope the issues. In this same careful manner, The Cider House Rules interweaves meaningful relationships among its characters and adds optimism to all resolutions.",The Cider House Rules

There are no forced feelings in this film.  Lasse Halstrom guides a talented cast through a great script and makes it so easy for us to identify with the characters on the screen.  Michael Caine delivers a great performance and manages to make his role both comical, and tragic.  Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron shine as two young people falling in love, and you can tell that there is chemistry between them, and you can feel the pain of what each must do at the end of the film.  The film is about finding yourself and realizing that you don't have to go very far to find out where your family is.  The Cider House Rules slowly creeps up on you and envelops you into a story that is heartwarming, funny, and sad. Truly, a great film that will leave you with moist eyes.",The Cider House Rules
67,bsinc,This was nominated for best picture?,6,4 March 2004,"""The Cider House Rules"" is one of those movies that never really reach me, they just become another number on my SEEN IT list. The movie moves nowhere and even when it does it doesn't feel like it. As if the director intentionally captured a single scene(and the emotions it provides the viewer with) and stretched it into two hours. Whether something sad or terrible was happening or whether, by coincidence, something nice and positive struck one of the characters it didn't make a hell of a difference to me, I couldn't care less for any of them. Surprisingly, after having said all of the above, the movie doesn't come out like some terrible boring mess that patients with insomnia get prescribed, but rather like yet another ""English Patient"". Overly long, incapable of making enough real sense and highly over-praised at the Oscars. Mr. Caine never convinced me he was even from the States, let alone speaking a certain dialect and the comment after mine best describes Tobey Maguire's retarded-like performance. All in all, not worth spending money on renting it, but if you catch it on TV prepare for a two hour apathy that is broken for some only when the always lovely Mrs. Theron gives a glimpse of her behind. 6/10",The Cider House Rules
68,majikstl,Slaughter House Rules,2,2 April 2004,"THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a cowardly film. Taking on one of the most morally complex issues of our time, the film hides its pro-abortion sentiments behind a facade of New England picture-postcard autumn landscapes and adorable freckled-faced children fresh from Kodak commercials. Those who oppose abortion are just nameless, faceless ""rulemakers"" who should be ignored or naive children who haven't learned about life. That is the depth of the film's political discussion.More than this, the film is about as loathsome and morally bankrupt as you can get. Right up front, I'll admit that I am adamantly anti-abortion, therefore the film offends me at its very heart, because it is unabashedly a commercial for abortion. But having said that, there is so much more in the film to find offensive. The moral bellwether of the film is Dr. Larch, who 1) is a drug abuser, 2) sexually exploits his nurses, 3) commits fraud and forgery to leave his practice to a young man who is obviously woefully ill-prepared to handle it. But, golly-gee-whiz, the arrogant Dr. Larch is so much smarter than any silly old college or government board. All of this unfolds at the orphanage that serves as the front for Larch's illegal abortion mill. But Dr. Larch is played by lovable old scamp Michael Caine, who reads bedtime stories to the orphans, so we are expected to overlook that the man is an amoral creep.Secondly, I found the film to be racist. The entire subplot at the apple orchard exists solely to get Homer into a situation where he feels compelled to perform an abortion, an act he has stated he finds morally wrong. To this end, the film introduces a black man and his daughter, who, at first, seem like kind, decent people. But they are mere props: The man gets his daughter pregnant -- that's what ""those kind of people"" do -- so Homer abandons his moral beliefs to embrace a more pragmatic (read pro-choice) stance. (This, of course, let's us know that abortion shouldn't be just for rich white folk.)So, a young man rejects his fundamental belief in the value of human life for the sake of social convenience. That he sells out his ideals would normally be considered a tragedy. I mean, if he voiced his disapproval of, say, lynching, but helped hang a man, no one would applaud. Innocence would clearly be corrupted. But abortion, the feminist equivalent to lynching, is somehow a clean killing, a type of death that anti-war, anti-death penalty, anti-fur, vegetarian liberals can embrace without any moral qualms. (How, I'll never understand.)Then there is the issue of ""the cider house rules,"" a set of simple rules that the workers at the orchard are asked to respect. The film, however, does not, and suggests rather boldly that any rule you don't like, don't understand, or just plain disagree with should simply be ignored. A line of thought, no doubt, endorsed by any self-respecting sociopath or career criminal. But ""the cider house rules"" are symbolic representations of The Ten Commandments (apples, first love, The Garden of Eden, etc.), so in effect the film suggests that basic concepts of morality are to be rejected as well, if they conflict with humanly wants. Abortion is so much easier to embrace if ""thou shall not kill"" is shrugged off as a silly, oppressive joke.The film's moral integrity is absolutely perverse. Using Homer as our surrogate, the film expects us to reject the rules of God the Father for the rules of Larch the Father, the drug addicted, sexist abortionist. More than being anti-Christian or anti-religion or even anti-God, the film -- for all of its fuzzy sentimentality -- is cold-blooded and nihilistic. It mocks ideas of spiritual values in favor of a ruthless hedonistic value system that recommends that you do whatever it takes to get whatever you want.

70,steiner-sam,Homer Wells is very bright but very passive,9,31 October 2021,"It is set in Maine from 1943 to 1945 and follows a boy raised in a private orphanage run by an older doctor who specializes in obstetrics and abortions.Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) was raised in the orphanage run by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Homer's two early adoptions don't work out, so he is raised by Dr. Larch and nurses Edna (Jane Alexander) and Angela (Kathy Baker). Homer is very bright but also has a very passive personality. Dr. Larch teaches him obstetrics and how to perform abortions, but Homer refuses to participate in abortions.After an air force pilot, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), and his girlfriend, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), come for an abortion, Homer becomes friends with them and decides it is time to leave the orphanage. He ultimately chooses to work in the apple orchard owned by Wally's family, and in the winter, he works with Candy's father in the lobster business.The rest of the movie follows the development of the relationship between Homer and Candy after Wally returns to war. Another plot addresses a group of African American migrant workers working in the apple orchard in season. Homer lives with the workers and becomes intensely involved in their lives which includes significant tragedy.The film ends as Wally returns home from the war, and Homer must decide what to do next in his life.This is the kind of movie I often reject because the plot is unbelievable. But the John Irving novel hooked me when I read it, and the film captures the complex story magnificently. Thus I set aside my disbelief and willingly absorbed the story. Michael Caine is spot-on as the damaged but beloved leader of the orphanage. Tobey Maguire has a pretty straightforward role as the passive Homer Wells who lets life happen to him except when he makes a few critical decisions.

Somewhat mushy, the film captures much of the sense of awe and wonder that the book has and tweaks them a bit, so it's a bit more sentimental. Michael Caine is of course beyond any criticism - but I'd like to give Tobey Maguire a hand for his acting: he manages to BE Homer Wells as I remember him from the book.

Along his journey, Homer comes experiences the throes of working class life, the feelings of despair among the migrants and longing for fortune, an incestous relationship, and heartbreak, all of which he takes in with a wide-eyed curiosity.

Lasse Hallstrom has a real pension for this brand of gooey, saccharine weepies (basically anything Miramax financed in the late '90s/early '00s) and it fills itself up with so much ""bring your tissues"" sentimentality that it made me want to vomit in the final act. It wouldn't be so bad if it was actually saying anything important, but it's not at all.The film is the most basic coming-of-age story of a young man experiencing life for the rest time and it doesn't strive to do...anything, really. It's further proof that Tobey Maguire has no charisma at all and can't lead a film if his life depended on it. Honestly, I'm having trouble thinking of someone with less screen presence in his age group and I am so glad that that late '90s surge of people constantly trying to make him the next big thing died out as quick as it did. Michael Caine and Delroy Lindo do fine supporting work, but Caine disappears after the first act and Lindo's character goes down a narrative path that is probably the worst thing about the film -- it's so absurd and out of absolutely nowhere, I'm honestly still trying to wrap my head around what that was even doing here.The whole thing sets up so many strands for the plot but doesn't center itself well enough and when it tries to tie all of those strands together it comes apart completely. It's so miserably paced, the final act drags on for eternity. It felt like it's probably a decent novel but in adapting it to the screen they tried to condense it so much and as a result it falls flat and entirely worthless.

The movie is set in the mid 1900's, in a Maine where abortion is quite illegal. Dr. Larch long-ago decided the law didn't make enough allowances and has dedicated himself to right these 'wrongs'. The movie deals with the coming-of-age of Homer: Originally seeing the sanctity of all life, seizing an opportunity to see the larger world, and eventually coming to agree with Dr. Larch's philosophy.

Homer gets to use the lessons he learned during his inner search for the common good of others, just like Dr. Wilbur did. That is the core message of the movie to me. Favorite scenes: the apple pickers doing their job. Homer saying good bye to Curly. Favorite quotes: ""Sometimes you have to make some rules to put things straight.""  Dr. Wilbur Larch I ask you, what has the law ever done for this place? Dr. Wilbur Larch: ""Goodnight, you princes of Maine. You kings of New England.""

The ""sleepy"" performance by Toby Maguire is a real problem. He is in most scenes and his inept acting obviously has a major impact upon the movie. Michael Caine gives a great lesson on how to get ""inside"" a character. There are controversial aspects here...abortion, incest, and the problems with prejudice. The dramas, however are too obviously constructed. Its pace is moderate, but that is O.K....after all....serious material like this should not be rushed.

81,The_Core,Underrated...,9,27 January 2000,"Very few of the critics seemed to ""get"" the deeper message of this movie, which is in fact the binding message that holds the entire movie together: that life isn't about rules, life is about living, and making the most of each moment and the best of each situation we find ourselves in.  Perhaps that's because critics like to think of themselves as 'rulemakers' in a sense, and the simplicity of this movie's message is either missed entirely or seen as threatening.  I'm not a critic by profession (thank goodness), but this movie indeed has a deeper message to convey.Very few people seem to be capable of looking beneath the surface of things anymore.  Our consumer- and youth-oriented culture seems to strongly encourage a surface orientation toward everything.  Almost nobody wants or is interested in deeper things anymore.  To know is enough... to *understand* seems like too much work.  The simple faith in the *moment* shown in this movie is breathtaking.  In ""The Cider House Rules,"" life is presented as taking place within a particular context, in an amazingly realistic way (not everybody is in control, just like in real life -- there are times when things get out of control, and we don't know why).  Boring to some people, maybe.  It doesn't get the adrenaline rushing.  There are plenty of other movies that do that.Controversial issues be damned - let the pundits argue, let the critics criticize, let the masses with the attention span of gnats (not to blame them, society as a whole is responsible) yawn... in its simplicity, humanity and *lack of direction* (which is a very common element encountered in real life, for those who hadn't noticed!), this movie has a depth, a subtlety and a greatness that I've rarely seen on the big screen.  9/10.",The Cider House Rules

What is St. Cloud's relationship with the locals? That we're asked to accept one doctor and two nurses care for dozens of orphans 24/7 is stupid and sloppy.Although Mr. Rose pays for his acts, Irving has the chutzpah to make this monster a figure of decency. It is he who tells Homer in so many words that The House Rules, which serves as a metaphor for the moral code people are taught to live by, are for suckers and dummies (and the pro-life ""wackos"" Irving railed at at the Oscars.) Homer, the supposedly naive lad, already knows this. When crises hits, he conveniently abandons the ""principals"" that forced him to break with Larch, and repays Wally by shagging his fiancée because poor Candy ""isn't really good at being alone.""Then Homer, as we knew he would, returns to St. Cloud's. Armed with phony degrees and board certification - none of which he questions and the Trustees don't even bother to verify - he (literally) takes Larch's place and readies to make the underage Mary Agnes his next conquest with the eager approval of all around him!

For example, the white apple-picking overseer, who probably made up the Rules, is given scarcely a thing to do, other than grumble through two scenes.  Kate Nelligan did a cameo, making me wonder if her part was condensed out of existence.  An ethical dilemma which is firmly established in the early part of the film, virtually disappears toward the end.  Maybe I was seeing a dilemma where none existed.Obviously a novel cannot be filmed without some deletions.  I thought the film was a very pleasant telling of a story, with plenty of parallels, lots of sentiment, but very little motivation.",The Cider House Rules

Starring: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd and Michael CaineI am a big Tobey McGuire fan, but after seeing this film for the second time, has not really changed my opinion on him in this film. Being a McGuire fan, I never thought his delivery could ever bring the impact of the movie down. It seems this movie is the only time I have a problem with Tobey's lack of emotion and energy. It works great with Peter Parker or his portrayal in Seabiscuit (2003), but hurts here. This was the first movie with him I ever saw, but even after watching this film, I knew he was born to be Peter Parker.

Of course, we ruled against taking Grandma to see this film at first because it sounded like a coming of age sex story, where a boy leaves home, starts work on a farm (or cider house) and he learns about the world from apples and a girl named candy.Well, the story did turn out this way, but it was much more down to Earth and much more 40's than expected.The movie has good acting and a good story. Irving's cameo and the appearance of the ""Cider House Rules"" are great. It is also very interesting how very minor elements, like say lobsters and reading rules are tied into topics like abortion, sex, relationships, not-following rules all the time, death, etc...This, while being more of an intellectual level is one that a lot (including Grandmas) would enjoy. It does not really send messages over the top and it does manage to entertain or at least keep most interested and thinking.While I do recommend this film I don't really think of it as best picture material.

One of these children is not actually a child. His name is Homer Wells, who has about 20 years old and live in the orphanage since he was born. While growing up, he learns some medicine technics. His life can be resumed to this. He has never seen the ocean and has met only the people who went to the orphanage to adopt a child or to do an abortion. One day, a young couple goes to the place trying to give an end to the girl's pregnancy. Suddenly, Homer decides to take a ride with them to somewhere. What happens after that will literally change his life.This is the story of ""The Cider House Rules"", which surprised everyone (including me) because of its 7 Oscar nominations, including best picture. If it didn't deserve the nomination in the main category, it doesn't affect on its quality. It is a great film, with important messages about life. And director Lasse Hallstrom could pass this to the audience in a very beautiful way.Everything in our life needs some rules. The rules have to be established in infinite situations, even in a cider house. But what happens when we break this rules? Well, that's what this film answers, and very well. What could have been a soapy drama is one of the most beautiful and touching films of last year. It is impossible not to be touched by the story of Homer Wells. The film mixes drama, romance and some mild laughs, resulting in a delightful experience.All the cast gives great performances, specially Michael Caine, who is being nominated as best supporting actor. This great acting wouldn't have been possible without a good screenplay- not just good, nearly perfect. John Irving adapts his own novel using good sense and discussing some polemic subjects, as abortion, incest, adultery. And he does this very well.""The Cider House Rules"" may not be the best film of '99, or a masterpiece, but it is a great film. That thing of ""The Haunting"", 'home is where the heart is', would serve better to this. And while its 2 hours, our heart is Homer Well's heart. Go see this one!9/10",The Cider House Rules

But it's so well crafted, so well written, so well acted, & so well directed it's OK. It just shows you the discomfort without preachiness or excessive commentary, and let's you absorb & process on your own. It's a difficult film to get through, but it definitely hits an emotional nerve, like all good movies do. A very strong film.

Honestly, I don't generally look for a message, I'm happy to enjoy a beautiful film for what it is and be happy with that.And then I come to the reviews. I mostly check reviews because it's nice to see other opinions agreeing with my own. Sometimes it's nice to see a decent arguement to my opinion, I might even learn something or find that detail that I missed. Sometimes, as is the case in question, I disappointedly find comments from those who seem to have no understanding of, well, anything. Wow, some of the bitter comments here.

95,Nate-48,"Interesting, some good acting but a little bit way too much going on which makes the script hard to believe",6,4 October 2018,"Ambitious movie, with some good acting from the great Michael Caine - Tobi Maguire plays the same guy who he always plays which is fine but how many times have you seen his act? I enjoy him but I can't get crazy about his roles because he is always the same guy,
But the main problem with this movie is the story, which asks us to believe in about 15 unbelievable things happening. It is not so much that a couple of the things could happen but it's just that all 15 (maybe a little more or less) would be highly unlikely to all happen in this small window of time (seems like about a year or two, maybe three - they never really tell you which is another problem).
Charlize Theron is the female lead here and I guess she plays the role fine, but I do not really love Theron or the role. 
Personally, I feel like a lot of the lines in this script are unlikely to have been uttered in the 1940s when this takes place - or frankly at any time.
I would probably have given this film a 4 or 5 based on the problems with the script but I bumped it up to a 6 because the ending is good, and you get two powerful performances from Lindo and Caine - who coincidentally are both English actors though most people would not know Lindo is English .... that's how good he is.",The Cider House Rules

The story is that of a young boy who grows up in under the wing of a country doctor. He learns the trade of his mentor, and then ventures out to make it on his own.

But this film is not about that. We are all brought to feel a range of emotions regarding orphans and orphanages. Today orphanages are replaced by foster care, and by arsinine abortion laws. You be the judge of the better option.
This film not only exposes us to migrant workers, but also apple picking, a little about lobsters; but far and away we learn about people.
There is envy for Homer Wells. Everyone seems to want him! What a treasure that must feel like!
Excellent performances by all; and I didn't miss webs not shooting out of Tobey's hands at all, hardly; ... OK, maybe just one time.
Charlize is as beautiful as ever.
The scenery is breath-taking -- not because it's fancy or dripping with wealth, but because its REAL. If you ever travel to Maine, you will be familiar with the red buildings!

98,imagiking,The Cider House Rules: Feels Somehow Incomplete,6,7 January 2011,"Having watched the film adaptation of The World According to Garp— perhaps John Irving's most well known novel—I was unconvinced that the epic scope of the Dickensian author's writing could be appropriately translated to film. Just hours after finishing The Cider House Rules— superior to Garp, in my opinion—I decided to watch the film. Its Oscar- winning, Irving-scripted screenplay, I reasoned, was about the only chance I had of being convinced otherwise.The Cider House rules follows the story of the unadoptable orphan Homer Wells. Trained in obstetrics by the orphanage founder and ether addict Dr Wilbur Larch, Homer grows up being told that he must ""be of use"". When a young couple comes in search of Larch's less legal form of ""delivery"", the now adult orphan is motivated to return home with them to experience life outside the orphanage.What I like—nay, love—about Irving's writing is its comprehensiveness: the encompassing, breathtaking scale of how he writes. His novels often follow characters from youth to old age; from birth to death; from one extreme to t'other. The book-to-film transition is one of the most difficult jumps to make between media, and one which so rarely works to create a brilliant offspring. But enough of that for now. The Cider House Rules about which I write is the film, and must be judged as such. The beginning offers us a quick introduction to life at the St Cloud's Orphanage and to Homer Wells and his mentor, harried ever so slightly by the irritating and mawkishly sentimental music which floats at the threshold of audibility—it's so cliché as to be emetic. This is a minor problem however in the face of Michael Caine's performance—the cause of the film's well deserved second Oscar; the way in which he masks his distinctive accent alone is fascinating. The scenes of the emotional Caine are clearly the best the film has to offer, his quiet moments of breakdown genuinely quite moving. Unfortunately much of the film is spent away from St Cloud's, dealing with Homer's budding romance with Candy. The relationship never seems quite as complex or well-explored as it could be, doing little to really draw the audience into it. Little in the film is especially captivating, just barely hanging onto our attention as it lightly brushes themes and topics without ever really doing much with any of these. It remains consistently interesting, but never anything much more. Ultimately, this film suffers the same fate as the film version of Garp: in attempting to bring a wide-ranging comprehensive story to the big screen, it loses the thematic and character depth of the source material. Whilst it does a fair job of exploring the rules with which we govern ourselves—the crucial cornerstone of the novel—it feels somehow incomplete. And despite the wonder of Caine's performance, his Larch is never so engrossing as the one on paper.Never boring, but never compelling, The Cider House Rules turns a fantastic novel into a just-better-than-mediocre film. Strong performances nevertheless and a touch of the book's important message give something of a positive spin however. Doing nothing so much as highlighting the gross differences betwixt the two media, it proves further to me that Irving is inherently unfilmable.",The Cider House Rules
99,bburns,"Norman Rockwell, with abortions.",6,1 April 2000,"In ""The Cider House Rules,"" Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) is trying to protect young Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) from the big bad world.  In this film, however, the big bad world is a Norman Rockwell painting.Well, that might not be fair to Norman.  After all, this film has sex, abortions, drug abuse, incest and knife-fights.  But it does share Rockwell's old-fashioned New England subject matter, his belief that all people are essentially good, and his basic feel-good shallowness.Ultimately, the films downfall is that the ugliness that creates the conflicts necessary to create a compelling story are glossed over.  Say what you will about ""Forrest Gump,"" it did not give short shrift to the things in life which are not pretty.Another problem I had with this movie was the moral message:  ""No matter what, you must behave selfishly, especially if it's out of love.""  It's okay for Dr. Larch to try and control Homer's life because they love each other. It's okay for Homer to have sex with his boss' son's girlfriend because they love each other.  Incest can be forgiven because daddy really loves his little girl.If you're into Norman Rockwell and have no moral code, I suppose you might really enjoy this movie.  As for me, I much prefer the Picasso of ""Being John Malkovich"" or the Van Gogh of ""American Beauty.""  I rated it a 6.",The Cider House Rules

101,PeterJackson,Boring and predictable right to the very end,5,11 March 2000,"I know some people decided to give this movie 7(!)oscar nominations, but it was also one of the biggest surprises when this was announced. And I can understand why it was such a big surprise: this movie is pretty bad! One of the rules(not those of the cider house)of the IMDB is that you should not write any spoilers. I will not do that, but the result will be just the same. I mean,when you make it through the opening scenes(which are rather confusing)and you know what's going on, you can also easily predict the rest of the film. IT'S THAT OBVIOUS! First of all, the story isn't very interesting. A boy that was raised inside a hospital gets  a chance to know ""the world"".(and see the sea...haven't we heard this before?BEING THERE,even the TRUMAN SHOW,...) Meanwhile some questions are raised about abortion, drugs and incest. But this was obviously too much to take for the director. So he put them aside and got on with the film. Nothing really seems interesting enough to explore and actually...nothing in this movie IS interesting enough to do that! Plus, the story is filled with clichés and is so incredibly corny that this doesn't even work as ""just an entertaining movie to sit through"". The symbolism(especially towards the end) is also very obvious. It's actually so obvious that they were probably thinking no one would get it if they didn't show it this way. Then the actors. I thought Tobey Maguire was pretty monotonous in this movie. Did they want him to act like some sort of good-natured idiot, a bit like Homer(indeed,the same name!) from THE SIMPSONS? Well,it's hard to compare these two (apart from the name)characters.But the major difference is that Homer Simpson is a funny, interesting character who seems to be more real-life than the dull,unappealing Homer Wells character in this film.Michael Caine however gave a fine performance(enough for an oscar nomination?), as did Delroy Lindo. And Charlize Theron? I think she wasn't bad, but wasn't very good either. In fact, I don't think she will ever be a great actress. Only good for small parts in films such as this one or THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE(in which she fit in very well,certainly much better than in this film).All in all, a film that isn't extremely bad. That's why I still give it 5/10. There are certainly films that are far worse than this one. But this film is too ambitious and predictable and also succeeds in being boring. A film that can easily be forgotten. And let's face it: does this really stand a chance against AMERICAN BEAUTY or THE GREEN MILE on oscar night? I honestly don't think so. As I said: 5/10.",The Cider House Rules

This is the most striking thing about the movie how Homer just Kind of cruises through never getting really upset or angry just thinking ""we shouldn't do this"" and ""Apples, I can pick apples. I like picking apples"" (Pronunciation on every syllable). Is entirely all there?
What I can't say about Toby I can say about Charlize Theron. She is fantastic in a role that portrays a fairly complex character in a realistic way. She really captivates the audience in ways that we wish Homer would or could.The story is slow paced and deliberate. I never for a moment doubted that Homer would go home to the orphange, not for even the slightest moment, Forest Gump couldn't leave his Jenny and Homer will never leave the orphange.The cinematography was beautiful but nothing really special a lot like the movie. It wasn't the actors though but the story itself.

108,shahrad,very delighting,8,9 May 2001,"How charming this movie is. It was a relief after watching it. The movie represents a different world, in which all the characters are peaceful and lovely. A world where you can find no sign of evil. A world which is so close to idealism. A magical innocence can be easily felt throughout the movie. I wish I could be there and experience the joy of living in such a wonderful place full of emotion with no sign of violence. This movie also touches your eyes with dazzling views of landscapes. Michael caine is wonderful. He was deserved to get the Oscar. And, lets talk about Charlize Theron. She illuminates in this movie. In my opinion, she's the sort of those actresses whom, Hollywood will always be needing. She reminds me of Marilyn Monroe, Ingrid Bergman and many other actresses who captured the screens with their beauties and glamour for decades. The score is pretty romantic and inspirational. I suggest this movie to everyone who's in touch even a little bit with their feelings.",The Cider House Rules
109,Wulfstan10,Well Made But Artificial and Unmoving,5,14 March 2005,"This film fails to be convincing or moving.The production values of this film were good, the basic plot had some interesting elements and addressed significant issues, and some of the acting was good. Michael Caine, in particular was quite good as usual.However, this movie seems thoroughly artificial, contrived, and stilted. The whole time I had the odd feeling that someone was simply reading a novel out loud without expression or emotion, instead of showing me a film based on the novel. That may seem odd, but that's the way I felt. The events seemed just there to show us the events or issues, rather than to develop the characters or stories. There often seemed no real point to many aspects of the film, which seemed gratuitous and devoid of meaning or significance. Sometimes, I could sense that the writer, film makers, etc., were trying to present elements as meaningful (such as the ""rules"" at the end) but utterly failed to do so. In addition, and this may be tied to the above problems, I ended up not really feeling much from, or for, most characters. Everything seemed artificial and distant, and the characters gave off little feeling.In short, despite some good visuals,production values, and acting, this movie is very artificial. It seems a hodge-podge of events and characters designed to showcase some themes, but either the book itself or the adaptation of the book to film failed to get beyond the artificiality of it, make the story or characters convincing, or evoke emotions in the characters and events (aside from however one feels about abortion, etc.).",The Cider House Rules

111,MagicStarfire,Don't watch this unless you have a couple of barf bags handy,1,25 May 2007,"WARNING SPOILERS! I watched this film because critics had lauded it so highly, and because one of my favorite actors, Michael Caine appears in it. Mr. Caine does fine work, as I suppose everyone in the cast does, but the characters and story line were so annoying, irritating, selfish and stupid, I could barely sit through it.Even the children at the orphanage were not exactly speckled pups in a little red wagon.First we have Michael Caine's character Dr. Larch, who is basically a father figure to Toby Maguire's character Homer Wells. Now on the surface Dr. Larch appears to be almost an angel--here is this saintly Dr. caring for these unwanted orphans, and being kind and loving. But Dr. Larch wants to browbeat Homer into also being a doctor, and we get the distinct impression that is not necessarily what Homer wants to do.Dr. Larch also has a problem dealing with reality when it comes to the orphanage children. These children are so protected from reality they have no concept of it whatsoever. When a young child dies, Dr. Larch secretly buries him, and the other children instead of attending a funeral and coming to terms with the fact there is such a thing as human death--are lied to, and told the deceased child has been adopted.I wondered, toward the end of the film, when an adult personage who worked at the orphanage passed away, if the kids were going to be told the adult had been adopted! Then we have Charlize Theron, as Candy Worthington, and her boyfriend Wally--who apparently are too stupid to use birth control--and too selfish and irresponsible to marry and become parents. But not to worry, Dr. Larch will solve that little problem that's getting in their way of a good time.Homer decides to suddenly leave the orphanage and go pick apples instead of becoming a doctor at the orphanage, which is what Dr. Larch plans him to be--never mind that he has no schooling and has not served any kind of internship at a hospital.Wally goes off to war, and Candy is left behind with a bad case of ""hot pants."" Well there's Homer all handy, ready and willing-- faithfulness is not part of Candy's make up, and Toby feels no loyalty to his friend Wally--so soon he and Candy are rolling in the hay. I fully expected her to have a second pregnancy and abortion.The love scenes between Candy and Homer were definitely nothing I'd care to ever have to see again. Toby McGuire is a fine actor, but he is about as far from being a romantic leading man as you could get. His character, quite frankly, came across as an ignorant,homely nerd.We also have a little side story with some blacks who work at the apple farm. Now I'm quite familiar with migrant Mexicans traveling with the crops--but this is the first time I've ever seen or heard of any migrant crop and fruit picking blacks traveling with the crops.Get the barf bag ready because here comes the worst part of this movie--Rose Rose, one of the black migrants, gets pregnant. And just guess who Daddy is. What makes this so barf-worthy, however, is how they make this man, who is guilty of completely selfish lust--turn into this sacrificing, caring, sensitive person. Character reality flew completely out the window on that one.Then we learn that Wally is now paralyzed from the waist down. Good old Homer is more than ready to marry Candy, but no, she may shag everything in sight, but Wally is her one true love--yeah, right! One can only wonder how someone with the kind of sex drive Candy obviously has, is going to be able to deal with a husband, whom we are led to believe, has become totally impotent. But that's just one more stupid decision a character makes in this movie.Definitely THE worst film I have seen in some time.I voted it ONE star because I could not vote anything lower.",The Cider House Rules
112,flickjunkie-3,"A Beautiful, Dramatic Piece of Work.",8,2 December 2000,"The Cider House Rules was not a film I really cared to see, it didn't look very intriguing in my opinion. But, intriguing was not the word for this piece of filmmaking. Brilliant is a more deserved word.Academy Award winning Michael Caine is the benevolent, ether-sniffing Dr. Larch, who runs a remote orphanage and performs illegal abortions for desperate women. Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is delivered, raised and loved by the doctor, who expects Homer to succeed him. But Homer longs to experience the world and find his own way. And when glamorous bomber pilot Wally (Paul Rudd) arrives on the scene, Homer's odyssey of love and betrayal begins, with narration from Caine and the affectionate, sarcastic correspondence between the father figure and the innocent abroad bridging the two. Inevitably, the crisis demands that Homer makes some difficult choices.Many dramas are beautiful, but sometimes just downright boring. If you think The Cider House Rules is ever going to be boring, think again. No, it isn't a marvellously never-ending thriller with action sequences every 15 minutes, but the plot twists are beautifully stringed together and the connection of the characters is entertaining and lovely. The actors are all extremely impressive, Tobey Maguire is perfect for the role of Homer, while Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd and Michael Caine make for an engaging supporting cast. The direction from the well-known Swedish mastermind Lasse Hallstrom is amazing, it is hard not to stand up and cheer for his effort that went into The Cider House Rules.Beautiful, memorable, realistic and intriguing, The Cider House Rules is strongly recommended to all audiences.I rate The Cider House Rules 9 out of 10.",The Cider House Rules
113,paul-nemecek,Cider House Rules,8,3 July 2018,"The key to understanding Cider House Rules is in the title itself. Roger Ebert says he's not really sure what the movie is about. Other critics have become embroiled in a rather heated debate about the politics of the film since Michael Caine plays a doctor who runs an orphanage and performs illegal abortions from time to time. Some have accused the film of being pro-choice propaganda; others have depicted it as a balanced treatment of the subject. For this reviewer the debate misses the point, because the point of the film is, I think, a bit more philosophical and abstract. The moral philosophy of the film is, in the words of Sartre, that we are ""condemned to freedom.""Tobey Maguire plays Homer Wells, the focal point of the film. Homer has grown up in an orphanage in Maine, and ends up as one of the ""unpicked"", that is, one of the children who hopes to be adopted, but never is--at least, formally. As Homer grows into adolescence, Dr. Larch, the head of the orphanage takes Homer under his wings and teaches Homer medicine. He also tries to teach Homer how to perform abortions, but Homer is passionately opposed. As Homer approaches adulthood, he decides that it is time for him to find his own way. He leaves the orphanage, and ends up picking apples, discovering the larger world, and falling in love. Homer makes more than a few mistakes along the way. Perhaps it is not an accident that it is an orchard that initially seems like Eden for Homer. Homer discovers what a burden it is to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and this is where he confronts the cider house rules.The film is thoroughly existential in its themes and moral philosophy. I am not particularly troubled by this. The best films are those films that make me think, not those that tell me what to think in a rather heavy-handed way. I believe in God as the ground and source of all truth. I also believe that we see through a glass darkly, and must therefore, ""work out our salvation with fear and trembling."" It is in this sense that we are condemned to freedom.The story, performances, and visual artistry are excellent. John Irving (Simon Birch, The World According to Garp) wrote the novel and the screenplay. Lasse Hallstrom (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Something to Talk About, My Life as a Dog) directs the story with tenderness and an eye for nuances in relationships--as is the case in his previous films. There are clear similarities between the central character here and Hallstrom's characters in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and My Life as a Dog. Michael Caine turns in a solid performance as Dr. Larch and Tobey Maguire is perfect as Homer Wells. This is a thoughtful story well told. Still, this is not a film for all. The PG-13 rating and the previews understate the mature themes of the film, and some are offended by the film's treatment of abortion. I found the film to be thoughtful and artfully done. Consistent with the theme of the film, you will have to decide for yourself.",The Cider House Rules

Finally he has redeemed himself by taking over the screenwriting role himself and making a John Irving film. The acting, directing and cinematography were all excellent.

Not that it's easy to watch (In fact it gets sour now and then) but I do agree with the message I think it tries to send - about tolerance.

120,Dkish,The coming of age story of a orphan as he becomes faced with conflict between duty and exploration.,9,19 December 1999,"`Cider House Rules' By Dean Kish	The coming of age story of a orphan as he becomes faced with conflict between duty and exploration.	Based on the John Irving novel `The Cider House Rules' tells the story of orphan Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) who is raised by orphanage doctor Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Dr. Larch teaches Homer the magic of his craft. One day the orphanage is visited by a beautiful woman (Charlize Theron) and her GI boyfriend (Paul Rudd) this causes a dilemma for Homer. Does he really want to know what its like in the real world? Another feeling Homer isn't to sure about is his feelings for this woman. He decides to leave the orphanage in search of love and a new life.	`The Cider House Rules' is a feel good type film with an underlining of controversy. The controversy plagues a lot of mankind today. It being the abortion conflict between `Pro-Life' and `Pro-Choice'. Throughout most of the film, Maguire's hero struggles with the morals of his mentor and exactly how will he approach that exact dilemma. Without having read the novel, I am not sure what screenwriter/novelist John Irving left out of his novel but I found the story moving and interesting. Tobey Maguire delighted me with another hero role in the surprise of last year, `Pleasantville'. That role and his in this film have a lot in common as they struggle with a decision that will vastly change each of their lives. Charlize Theron continues to find strong woman roles and juicy scripts as she hones her talent. As for the chemistry between Maguire and Theron it is quite lacking and makes me think of a supermodel and a teen boy. Maguire's depth never really fleshes out Homer as he seems to hide a lot of what is occurring within Homer. What I did love in the film was the return of Michael Caine to a role he can be good at. He hasn't had one since 1997 where he starred in two great roles. He played F.W. de Klerk  in `Mandela and de Klerk' and Victor in `Blood and Wine'. The scenes with Caine were great.

127,Sam_Gray,the weakest of the Best Picture contenders (spoilers),5,3 March 2000,"To be fair, it really looks like I'm in the minority with my opinion here, but I think that The Cider House Rules is very much overrated.  For one thing, the film often comes off as much as a sermon as it does as a story. I think most of the other socially minded films of the year, such as The Insider and The Hurricane, avoid this, but The Cider House Rules is awfully bogged down by its central issue, abortion.  There's just a few too many instances in which somebody says something like ""If only she had gotten an abortion"" or ""This is what happens when somebody doesn't get an abortion."" Come on.  Isn't that just a little patronizing?  Generally, whenever someone says something like this, the movie has already argued this point through the progression of its story.  Its like John Irving doesn't expect us to understand his argument unless he bludgeons us with it.  And, by the way, Christians will probably be at least a little offended as the film does have some specifically anti-Christian dialogue.Furthermore, I don't really think The Cider House Rules presents abortion entirely realistically.  Anyone who's even a little familiar with the subject knows that women who have abortions experience tremendous emotional stress, yet Theron's character seems unaffected by her abortion.Also, the leads aren't that appealing.  Maguire really underacts, his voice rarely showing any sign of inflection.  I don't like Theron's character either, but I think that's because she's written rather one-dimensionally. No actress could have done much with that character.What I do like about the movie though is the subplot involving the Roses. In fact, I'm going to go against the grain again here and argue that Delroy Lindo delivers the film's most interesting performance.  I mean, Michael Caine is effective in his role, true, but Lindo commands your attention any time he's on the screen.  The plot twist involving his character is the film's most interesting by far.  But it's too little and much too late, for most of The Cider House Rules is, at best, average and, at worst, condescending.  5/10",The Cider House Rules

This movie is very moving and involving, with a cast all star (it's nice to see again a great actress of the 70's like Jane Alexander), which features the great Maguire, one of the best actors of his generation, the beauty-but-good-actress Charlize Theron, a great actor like Delroy Lindo and a living legend like Michael Caine, always great, funny and serious.

This movie is full of such beautiful pictures of New England, it's breathtaking at times.The actors. To be honest I hadn't seen many movies with the actors from this movie before. I thought from what little I had seen of Tobey Maguire that he might be a great actor and he is. Also very charismatic and like born for this part. Paul Rudd. Even though he has a rather small part he makes the best out of it and is very good. I'd like to see more of him. Michael Caine. He certainly deserved the Oscar for his work on this one. Great performance. Charlize Theron. She is the one who surprised me the most. I hadn't seen any movie of hers but Might Joe Young got a lot of promotion and it looked pretty bad to me and my opinion on Charlize was that she's probably another pretty blonde not gifted actress. But I did her wrong as she puts a heart to her character and performs very believable. Erykah Badu. I thought she was a professional singer and I think she really is, but in the movie she seemed like a professional actress. Very gifted!The score.

It is hard to believe John Irving wrote both the 600-page novel and the movie screenplay.  If I had written the book, I would have wanted a tighter storyline.But in all honesty, even if it were a better film, I still would not have liked its premise, themes, or ideas.  It seems to be based on the thought that ""rules are made to be broken.""  There are several instances of laws, rules, and social norms that are broken repeatedly without showing any of the consequences of those actions.  Nobody ends up in jail for breaking the law, no employees are punished for breaking company rules, and nobody is shown with hurt feelings when a trust is violated.  The characters even react to the deaths of other characters with little sadness, if any.

I was so glad to see the wondrous Paul Rudd playing something other than a gay man too. I'm devastated that one of the choices Irving made was to drop the character of Melony (she was my favorite), but I suppose you can't have everything.As a movie, there were a few too many extreme close-ups for me, but overall, it flowed beautifully. And I know it's going to get a lot of flack for being this ""abortion movie"" (as the book did for tackling the subject), but the movie, if anything puts the whole subject in relief. Like ""Dead Man Walking"" did with capital punishment, this movie shows that there are no easy answers to the whole abortion question. But every once in awhile, under the right circumstances, you just gotta...break the rules. One of the best movies of the year.",The Cider House Rules
135,screamer-13,Fully deserving of nomination...,8,13 March 2000,"Well after walking into the wrong cinema room, I was initially horrified to see Tobey Maguire gracing my screen (I had just puked my guts out at him in Ride With The Devil), but everything was soon righted when Charlize Theron made her entrance, man she is hot! Also I thought Delroy Lindo was Laurence Fishburne and didn't even realise that Michael Caine was playing a major role! Anyway, all of the above were superb and the film, although seeming to be going nowhere around 2/3 of the way through, wraps up with perfect Spielbergian circularity and the final scenes, which I would normally scorn as another happy ending, are genuinely heart-warming and made me realise why the film was Oscar-nominated. The film spans a reasonable period of time, which I tend to count against most films, but this is not just another film. It starts in a happy and likeable atmosphere to get the audience engaged, then moves on to look at various issues and relationships all of which are interesting, it creates twists for itself before righting itself and finishing as it started. It's a class act, with lovely colourful scenes of countrysides, lovely forties attire and vehicles and attitudes, and loads of other cool stuff.

136,geoaar-1,A well-made movie about not very much,6,11 November 2013,"Yes, a charming New England setting for a movie about love and incest and abortion, and situational ethics, and it sorta misses on all points.I guess the overriding message is that rules don't matter, laws don't matter, even situational ethics don't matter, it's only whatever you personally feel like at the moment. Feh, I guess that's enough for a lot of the audience.Here you have adorable, innocent children who die senselessly; honest, hardworking, likable fathers who impregnate their own daughters and are then murdered and/or commit suicide, war heros whose girl he left behind is shamelessly unfaithful, a doctor who not only performs illegal abortions, but apparently has no problem with euthanasia either. And then an orphan boy doctor who brings the whole sordid story to a heartwarming conclusion by taking up as a doctor in his own right, even though he has zero formal education and his credentials are all forged.I never really figure out what this movie was trying to be. It seemed to me to be simply a string of non-sequitors loosely based around the idea that there are no rules. It's a pleasant-enough movie most of the time, but what it was trying to say turned into a rather garbled message.Anti-abortion folks, I'm sure, hate this movie.

141,rj-27,What's the real message here?,2,13 September 2000,"I rented this film on the recommendation of a friend because in her words, it was about orphanages and we had adopted a boy from an orphanage in Russia.  It's about orphanages? Really?  I am now wondering what movie she was looking at.  The orphanage was nothing more than a backdrop for a thinly disguised social commentary on the virtues of abortion as the best alternative for unwanted children.  The very first scene shows Homer about to throw an aborted fetus into the incinerator from a porcelain pot he is carrying.  Later on in the movie he alludes to the incinerator as the certain future he would have faced had his mother come to Dr. Larch wishing to abort him.  This coherent argument is of course incinerated by the time the anti-abortion Homer meets up with a co-worker who is pregnant by her father. Of course there can be no other future than the incinerator for a child that happens to be the product of rape or incest.  Homer is thus converted to the proper faith.  Naturally, his love interest also has an abortion which is how he comes to meet her. Are you getting the picture? I'm wondering why, after all the extramarital sex Homer has with Candy, the scritpwriters didn't have her get pregnant again just so they could throw in another abortion for good measure.  That would have climaxed the movie in the best way to underscore the vocation Homer chose in going back to the orphanage, leaving Candy, and making sure no more unwanted children ended up in a place where they couldn't possibly find any self worth.",The Cider House Rules

144,gga,A conventional yet moving film...,8,2 January 2000,"After going thru all the comments, the least I can do is to agree with all of them. The movie, due to its subject matter, could have easily turned into a cheesy movie of the week, but it avoids this marvelously thanks to some great performances, great character direction and a beautiful photography. This is indeed a standard ""coming-of-age"" story.  Not having read the book, I still felt the story condensed, and some of its other threads not fully realized, like the subject of abortion which starts very strongly, but then fades for a while only to come back later at the end.  Much better and subtle is the depiction of race in the early part of the 20th century, although some African-Americans might find it a little offensive to them. Delroy Lindo gives an astounding performance with so very little.  Erykah Badu is a revelation.  Michael Caine is at his best, and shows the younger cast what acting is all about. Tobey Maguire is likeable as usual, but gives a performance similar to his role in Pleasantville -with little or no emotion and seeming to have more insight into other character's lives than John Irving, the author, himself. This worked great in Pleasantville, but it was wrong for this movie. While sometimes melodramatic and predictable, the story does deliver its punches well and you shouldn't be ashamed to let a tear wash your cheeks. Come Oscar time, you won't see The Cider House Rules in any big category, but still it is a movie that will play well and be enjoyed by many.",The Cider House Rules
145,Ken-120,A blatantly manipulative and ideologically wimpy film,8,25 March 2001,"Mr. Irving might pride himself on his oscar for this film and enjoy the money he gained from it, but it does not hide the fact that this film takes the easy ways out, both artisticly and philosophically.
First, the film bends over backwards to mine as much sympathy for the orphans as possible.  The worst offender is the feature secondary orphan character who is perpetually shown to be at death doors with oxygen tents and all.  The film throws almost all its emotional weight on him and it comes off as subtle as the proverbial brick through the window.The more serious concern is that the film tries to argue for reproductive control, including the right to chose abortion as an option.  However, for all the eloquence of Michael Caine's character, the film wimps out and goes for a mushy compromise.  I am refering to the fact the Caine character dies as a ether addict, which one reviewer saw as a punishment for his activities, while the Tobey Maguire character, who is pro life in stance, agrees to perform an abortion for a woman who was a victim of incest.  Only the most rigidly fanatically pro lifers oppose abortions under that kind of circumstance and the film comes off as too cowardly to cowardly to take a real stand for a woman's right to chose.That kind of film may satisfy the studio bean counters, but I want films with the backbone to take a stand on a difficult topic such as this.",The Cider House Rules
146,DaCritic-2,Fabulous,9,4 December 2000,"I'm a huge fan of John Irving, and have been ever since I read ""The World According To Garp"" back in the early 1980's.  I've read most of his novels, but none of them have moved me in the same way as ""The Cider House Rules.""Naturally, I was a little leery about seeing one of my all-time favorite novels dramatized.  The casting really caught my eye, especially Michael Caine as Wilbur Larch (I originally pictured Richard Harris in the role, for some reason), and Charlize Theron as Candy.  I have a lot of respect for Ms. Theron as an actress, and she's very easy on the eyes.It also helped that John Irving himself wrote the screenplay ... and took a LOT of time (ten years) to do so.  I can understand why, too ... the story arc within the novel spans something like forty years ... more like eighty, if you figure in Dr. Larch's biography as well.  To present the core of a story that massive within a two-hour block of time, without losing any major elements of the story, was quite a challenge.Well, Mr. Irving was up to the challenge, and the movie was wonderful.  The actors were convincing, the dialogue was good, the pacing of the story was very good.  I was surprised at some of the changes, certain elements that had been left out, situations that the characters reacted to differently on screen than they had in the novel.  What surprised me even more was that all of these things worked, and made the story work as well, if not better than, in the original story.SPOILERS BELOWNow, as to the ""agenda"" of the story: My girlfriend has referred to it as ""the feel-good, pro-choice movie.""  I think that Mr. Irving does have a very strong opinion about abortion, and he does express it within the story, but there's a deeper message to it; that people have to make moral and ethical judgements about laws, and decide for themselves which ones are worth following and which ones are better off ignored or only followed for the sake of appearances.Dr. Larch has decided that, since women will seek out abortions whether they are legal or not, he will perform an abortion on whoever asks, in a time when abortion was completely illegal; this is better than the potentially fatal alternatives, which are spelled out in graphic detail in the novel, and mentioned several times in the movie.So, he's risking his medical licensure, his job, and his freedom in order to provide a service in a way that will save the lives of women who might otherwise be severely injured or die.Regardless of your personal views of this hot-button issue, you have to respect the character of Dr. Larch for continuously risking so much to do something, just because he feels that it's the right thing to do.",The Cider House Rules

There is a good, hard storyline that often pulls back to reality -- a direction most movies in the ""touching"", ""heartwarming"" category drive towards.  This is the stuff of real life, and Maguire brings across the naievity of the Wells character so well.Not to typecast Maguire, but he plays young and naive SO well... his performance in Pleasantville (1998) was superb, and in The Cider House Rules, he reprises that same authenticity and sence of being genuine.  You believe Maguire IS Homer Wells...The casting in the film is meticulious, and you can tell attention was given to EVERY character, right down to the nurses (one of which is played by my favourite dramatic actress Kathy Baker of Picket Fences fame...)Other strong performaces come from the direction of some of the young actors in the film, notably Kieran Culkin and Erik Sullivan...

Get a life, Ebert).Having sat, painfully, through this film and experienced Maguire's incompetence up close,(and taking into account his similarly dismal performance in ""Wonder Boys,"" and ""The Ice Storm"") I'm at a loss as to why any director would want to hire this glacial non-entity.  The film itself was O.K., due mostly to Michael Caine, who is an old hand at this sort of thing: the crusty yet benign father figure bit is right up his alley. 
But Maguire the Comatose kept sucking the life out of every scene he was in: Maguire is to the art or acting what Jeffrey Dahmer was to the art of cooking: i.e., repellent.

Homer is taken care of by the nurses and is the protege of Dr. Wilbur Larch, played by the great Michael Caine who delivers an amazing right on target performance, an illegal abortion giving, baby delivering, ether addicted doctor who has hopes of Homer taking over for him.However Homer wants to see a bit of what's out there but he doesn't go very far simply traveling across Maine. There he works in a cider house and out picking apples in the orchard.  There he falls in love with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), a girl who has ""trouble being alone"".  Though Homer realizes that he can't have Candy, because her husband just returned from the war, and they can never be together. He accepts this and decides to return to the orphanage, the place that holds his heart and passion.While a compelling drama ""Cider"" is also a great character study going in depth on Homers struggles with accepting himself and his love of the orphanage and more importantly the children that stay there. So, How far do we have to travel to find where we really belong? For Homer, to a small cider house and apple orchard across the state of Maine.Beautifully photographed, compassionately directed by Hallstrom, and featuring great supporting roles filled by Kieran Culkin, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, and Erykah Badu among others, ""The Cider House Rules"" is easily one of the best films of the year and certainly delivers compassion and inspiration to its viewers.""Good night you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England.""",The Cider House Rules

One of the two dozen orphans, Homer, played by Tobey Maguire, has grown to young manhood in  the orphanage and assists the doctor as he delivers babies and also performs abortions.  The doctor wants Homer to stay and carry on in his footsteps, but Homer leaves the protectiveness of the orphanage and goes to work in an apple orchard, picking apples with a group of African American apple pickers.The acting is superb and the story is deep on many levels, dealing the some tough questions of right and wrong.  If anything, the characters are just a little too sweet, too loving, too good to be true.  And this is the first movie I ever saw about an orphanage where the children were not mistreated. Frankly though, I found all of this refreshing and a new and interesting reality.I understand that it is only a small portion of the novel that actually spans 30 years.  Many years ago I read ""The World According to Garp"" by John Irving and have stayed away from him ever since.

164,jmille42,Top 5 Film Class Movies: The #1 Film,9,1 August 2005,"We've made it, my number one favorite film from class, The Cider House Rules. The story of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the head physician of an orphanage in Maine who takes an ""unwanted"" orphan named Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) under his wing. As Homer grows older, he begins to question what life is like outside of the orphanage. Although he is training to become a doctor under the watchful eye of Larch, Homer decides to leave the orphanage with Candy (Charlize Theron) and Wally (Paul Rudd), a young couple looking to secretly have an abortion. Homer discovers love, friendship, and the all too familiar heartbreak in life outside of the orphanage where he has spent his entire life.Larch's big plans for Homer to take over for him at the orphanage are derailed as Homer begins the hard labor of apple picking, where he encounters the cider house rules, a set of guidelines for the migrant workers to abide by as they are a guest in the shelter provided for them. Homer along with the other workers start to realize that they are able to set their own rules for life as they seem to break every rule without consequence. One of my favorite scenes is when the migrant workers find out Homer is a trained Doctor, needing him to perform an abortion. Anyone who has seen the film knows Homer's moral dilemma when it comes to abortion (on numerous occasions he displays his thanks to the mother he never knew for having him), but in the end he breaks his own rules.I have so much respect for the author and screenwriter for the film, Academy Award winning John Irving. I was able to read his novel, My Movie Business, which goes into detail about his hard journey in getting this to the big screen. Irving's number one goal with this story is to show the relationship between Dr. Larch and Homer, a pair that begins to drift away from one another as Homer grows older. Larch plays the role of the clingy father figure who does not want to lose his only ""son."" The story works to the level that boys will become men, no matter how hard it is as a parent to accept it. In the end, the Cider House Rules shows there is no escaping destiny, no matter how bad you want to.",The Cider House Rules
165,Nikos-12,"Warm-hearted, but with just enough edge",9,28 May 2000,"A warm-hearted tale of wartime New England originally written in the mid-Eighties, the rather darker themes of abortion and betrayed loyalties runs through this film. Writer John Irving  recently defended his novel, saying that it took fourteen years for his screenplay translation (which won him an Oscar earlier this year) to reach the screen not because of the subject matter but because of the lack of a suitable director.
Fortunately, the talented Swedish director Lasse Halström, who was directing such gems as 'ABBA: The Movie' around the time Irving was writing the story, but later went onto 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', took the helm. He has done an excellent, unobtrusive job, setting this touching story of a Forties orphanage-cum-abortion clinic among some beautifully photographed Maine countryside. Michael Caine, with an unusually subtle performance and a decent accent (both of which contributed to his recent Academy Award), plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, the liberal-minded head of St. Cloud orphanage. During the Thirties a young mother leaves a baby boy in his care, whom he names Homer Wells. Homer (promising young actor Tobey Maguire) is never taken away by prospective parents and so Dr. Larch trains him in the science of midwifery and, to his increasing moral objection, abortion. However, when a young couple (Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron) in need of Dr. Larch's services arrive, Homer decides to leave with them and make his way in the wide world.
Homer takes a job picking apples with a group of migrant workers led by the enigmatic Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo). From here the plot thickens in surprising ways, ultimately heart-warming, but often edgy enough to ask important questions about their superficially staid society. With a glut of believable and moving performances from the leads, the film really benefits from an excellent supporting cast, especially the migrant workers and the orphans. Emotional, powerful and beautifully shot, The Cider House Rules is just the thing for a quiet Sunday evening.",The Cider House Rules
166,ajhall,"Good story, good acting, good movie!",7,4 November 2000,I liked this movie overall.  Story was predictable but enjoyed it anyways. Charlize Theron (Candy Kendall) was way too much woman for Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire).  Homer seemed too 'wide-eyed' at times that distracted from his otherwise interesting role.  Highly recommend this movie. 7/10.,The Cider House Rules

169,Fleapit,"Forbidden Fruit. Irresistible. Taboo, Taboo, Taboo.",8,13 August 2003,"*************** SPOILER *************     A charming and absorbing film. Readily appreciated for its superficial story it has darker inner meanings. It won an Oscar for Michael Caine, not an actor to my liking but this time he drops his silly irritating cockney accent and performs reasonably well but not really up to Oscar standard. Set during WWII in the year 1943, ostensibly the story of an orphan (Homer Wells - Tobey Maguire) brought up as the protégé of the Doctor Larch (Michael Caine) administering an orphanage in the state of Maine, the film deals with three taboos; illegal abortions; incest; the unfaithfulness of wives of serving soldiers away at war. In doing so the film spreads itself too thinly leaving many things unexplained such as the ether addiction of Dr. Larch, the background to Candy Kendall (former South African Playboy model Charlize Theron) having an abortion just before her forthcoming marriage to her army officer boy friend. How did someone find an abortionist back in 1943 and what did it cost? Surely it would have been easier for her boyfriend to find one of his Medical Officer colleagues willing to do it? Also since the medically unqualified Homer ends up by stepping into the shoes of his mentor Dr. Larch one senses the implication that the good doctor was himself unqualified. Dr. Larch regularly bids 'goodnight' to his beloved orphans with the phrase 'Goodnight my Princes of Maine: you Kings of New England' however this becomes incongruous when Homer's bogus degree certificate refers, in Latin, to 'the Republic of Maine'. The incest occurs between a father and his daughter who are part of a group of coloured itinerant apple pickers at the orchard where Homer gets his first job after leaving the orphanage. The Rules of the Cider House these workers must follow are clearly displayed but, although openly flaunted they are irrelevant to the film. In the language of cinematic symbolism the broken rules are those of life's moral code relating to the film's three taboos. Although that on the discussion of abortion has changed much since 1943 it was absolutely banned by the Hays office until William Wyler's 1951 'Detective Story' with Kirk Douglas. The other two remain as strong as ever; incest is universally repugnant and who is going to confront the soldier-hero returning from the war with tales of his wife's infidelity? One of the rare films dealing with this is John Schlesinger's 'Yanks' (1979)which earned Rachel Roberts a BAFTA award for best supporting actress. In CHR the main action takes place in an apple orchard - apple the 'forbidden fruit' of the Garden of Eden. This was the tacit theme of the popular wartime Andrews Sisters' hit 'Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree' which echoed the plea of the soldier at war to his girl friend/wife to remain faithful '....don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me until I come marching home .....'. A later hit tried to give him that reassurance when Alice Faye sang  '..... no love, no nothing, I'm getting plenty of sleep.....no love until my baby comes home.....' Here the left-alone Candy blatantly goes out of her way to seduce the naive and innocent Homer, brought up as he was in the sheltered environment of an orphanage with no mother and a foster father. In one shot we see Candy with a come-hither look on her face as she sensually bites into the symbolically forbidden apple. In another Homer is shown how to pick apples, symbolising his sexual initiation. Towards the end Candy's husband is invalided home paralysed from the waist down after his plane crashes, presumably leaving him unable to have children but the story unsatisfactorily hangs there. Generally good acting all round and, unusually for a contemporary film, there is a refreshing lack of foul language.One petty quibble: before seeing this film I found its title ambiguous as the word 'rules' can be interpreted as either noun or verb and still make sense.",The Cider House Rules
170,Einsiedeln,"Nice film, but...",7,25 February 2000,"Overall, I think that ""The Cider House Rules"" was quite a good film.  It stood out as an excellent example of filmmaking, editing, and cinematography.  However, in acting it is only moderately good.  Often, I consider good acting to be the ability to make me, as a viewer, forget that these _are_ actors, and that they actually are the people they're portraying.  That kind of experience is, unfortunately, rare.  *shrug* And was I the only one who thought that Tobey Macguire looks far, FAR too young to be bedding Charlize Theron?Again, a good film, but not the one I'll be rooting for come the Academy Awards.Rating: 7/10.",The Cider House Rules
171,hoffes,What can I say...? It's anti-human all the way.,4,7 May 2011,"-----------SPOILERS INSIDE--------------First of all - you HAVE to read the book by J.Irving before you watch this movie. This will give you the right perspective. In the movie itself many things are told in a specific way or simply omitted. Also, the characters are flat, the plot is straight and simple - in the book you really feel what they think and feel. But this is obvious, movie is just a movie and you can't copy 700 pages of a book into 2 hrs movie. Let's get to the point. The main character (Homer Wells), an orphan, leaves the orphanage, he copulates with the girl-friend of his friend (in Irvings book they (Homer and girl) have a children and the story goes for like 15 years or more - this is shortened in the movie very much). The friend goes to the war and the couple is not sure what to do. Other main character, a doctor (Wilbur Larch), abortionist with virtually a lust for abortions and proving in hundred ways the rationale for this kind of ""assistance to women's needs"", is a drug-addict, convincing everyone that abortion is just the solution when a woman has ""trouble"". There is NOT even 2 arguments for the life of the unborn babies. Abortion or being an orphan - this is how pregnancy is shown. Only once, in a discussion between Larch and Wells, Homer says it's better to be alive (than to be murdered). Once. All along the movie, you will see dozens of arguments for abortion as a solution. If you are conservative, the movie and the book will make you puke, or at least, leave you a bad taste. But it's not only about abortions - it is about changing the rules. Rules of the world we live in. Another character, who made his own daughter pregnant, is talking about changing the rules - we did not make them, so we can change them, it's our world, THEY (who? history? the world we do not belong to?) have written the rules, not us.ALL revolutions, leading to disaster, start this way. This is one big anti-human, anti-civilization movie. All character break some rules - sex with your friends girlfriend, sex with your daughter, justifying abortions as a solution, drug addiction (just barely shown in the movie, a lot more colourful in the book), breaking the law (abortion was not legal them and the doctor finds 100 arguments to justify it) etc etc. Do not show it to your growing children. I am rating this 4 out of 10 - as it is not completely bad to watch. The book is pretty nice to read (if you skip ugly propaganda) and the author has true talent for narration. But the matter, the subject - oh, sooo wrong, imho.",The Cider House Rules

While the acting was great, the direction and cinematography very good, the story was right out of Kmart.  THe writer was clearly just going down a list of about 8 interesting, even controversial themes to get the attention of the audience, but only 'skimming the cream' of each one. Never going anywhere deeper or challanging us.  In the end, he tried to tie it together by a very lightweight ""rules list.""  Give me a break..

Reading the book as a supplement to the film would help you further understand the underlying themes of the story, themes the screenplay sometimes doesn't seem to be completely comfortable with. That's the only weakness of this movie, however. Vivid sets and a fluid plot serve as background to the true strength of Cider House Rules, the acting. This is the best-acted movie of the year, with Oscar-worthy performances appearing in every scene. Michael Caine is at his strongest here as the stubborn but soft doctor/caretaker.

OK, maybe I liked the orphan girl  maybe I did feel sorry for Air Force pilot who was a nice guy who got dealed with behind his back, but if this is in any way supposed to be a feel-good movie, it failed.  There's one scene in particular where we're supposed to feel sorry for two characters actions towards each other because they're ""human.""  Well, one was a murderer and the other a monster, so I felt nothing for either of them.  If Stanley Kubrick had directed the same material, it would have been complete sarcastic satire.

176,Laurie Mann,"Quiet, understated, complicated film",8,19 March 2000,"I enjoyed The Cider House Rules.  Compared to The World According to Garp or Simon Birch, it's not as quirky as many other movies based on John Irving books.  Tobey Maguire plays one of his quiet observer roles again; but he's someone who just wants to keep things calm.  Michael Caine gives a nice performance as the pragmatic doctor but his accent is so flat it's like a newscaster's. I happened to see Cider House and Simon Birch on the same day and Cider House did a much better job at portraying a very particular time and place.  I liked Delroy Lindo's performance very much also. He has a very thankless role (and wasn't nominated for anything at Oscar time but probably should have), but was particularly good.  A few reviewers have complained about the way his character was written, but I have to disagree.  There are millions of people out there like Delroy Lindo who are intelligent, ""normal"" people to most but are monsters in their private lives.",The Cider House Rules

I was very excited to learn that Mr. Irving himself had written the screenplay for this version and was not disappointed.  Even though it has been well over 10 years since I read the novel, it was one that left a lasting impression and the movie is very true to the book.  John Irving is a master of character development and tells a good tale filled with social and moral implications. Another favorite of mine, Michael Caine, does his usual fine job, as do all the other actors, including all of the child actors portraying orphans.

182,jtpapp,One of my favorite films,9,23 June 2010,"There have been very few films over the past decade that I can watch many times over and still appreciate. Even after memorizing all of the dialogue and knowing how every scene will play out, there is still something about this film that transcends that knowledge and makes every viewing as enjoyable as the last.The story takes place in the 1940's and revolves around an orphan named Homer that resides at the St. Clouds Orphanage He is adopted on separate occasions, but is returned each time, eventually turning an age that makes him undesirable to parents seeking to adopt a child. It is then that the head doctor of the orphanage, Dr. Larch, decides that if Homer is to stay at St. Clouds, he must be of use. Dr. Larch teaches Homer how to perform births, as well as abortions. A couple, Wally and Candy come through seeking the latter and Homer decides to leave the orphanage and travel with them back to their hometown. Homer finds that he enjoys the work in the orchard that Wally's family owns and decides to stay and work there against the wishes of Dr. Larch since he sees Homer as wasting his surgical talents on picking apples. Wally is eventually called to fight in the war and the rest of the story revolves around Homer and Candy's relationship and their relationship with the migrant workers that come through the orchard on a yearly basis.The most striking aspect of The Cider House Rules is in the editing and cinematography. There are no quick cuts to be found here. The shots linger long enough to get a sense of place and setting. The actors actually have to act as opposed to just having to throw up an expression for a few seconds. Michael Caine shines as Dr. Larch and exudes just the right amount of grandfatherly guidance for Homer. Tobey Maguire does a serviceable job playing Homer, and Charlize Theron isn't bad playing Candy. Delroy Lindo is very good as the head of the migrant workers, Mr. Rose.As a final thought, The Cider House Rules should be sought out if you haven't seen it yet, and is a thoughtful drama that is heavy-handed on the pro-life debate, even though it is in there. Those with a strong opinion against abortion will probably not care for the film as much as those that are on the fence or pro-choice. Beyond that, the film is enjoyable due to the good acting and great direction from Lasse Hallstrom.As for those that have read the book know, there are many more developed characters and plot lines in the book, and Homer's time at the Orchard lasts 15 years as opposed to the few that are in the film. But these things obviously had to be cut back for the film, and the makers did a good job of adapting the material for the screen in leaving out what wasn't absolutely necessary to create a film version of John Irving's novel.",The Cider House Rules

If its many negative themes (no spoilers here... other reviews point them out) don't make you (even more) disgusted with humanity, then you will likely enjoy this movie since it was done well.

184,Verbal-20,What a piece of,1,24 March 2000,"Miramax is doubtless the most unscrupulous film--I mean, movie--distributor in the business. It puts a mediocre movie out, and come Oscar time, pours tons into a marketing campaign that gives them so much undeserved attention that those ""masterpieces"" walk away with scores of awards. Don't believe me? Last year they won TEN Oscars, and bought every single one of them. Life Is Beautiful was a fantasy, a remarkably offensive and ludicrously overrated Holocaust comedy (Roberto Benigni can't act his way out of a paper bag and we gave him Best Actor--no longer can anyone say this country is racist), and Shakespeare In Love didn't deserve Best Picture over Godzilla, let alone Saving Private Ryan.Why do I bring this up? Because Miramax is threatening to do the same with this *deliberately* directionless, fragmented, zero-plot piece of oversentimental, underwritten and overdirected garbage. Movies like the remarkable L.A. Confidential, which create fascinating, diverse plot elements and actually manage to bring them together to add up to something, deserve Oscars. But the makers of this movie have the audacity to create a movie they know is episodic without even trying to bind the episodes together. It just introduces an event, deals with it a while, lingers to let the emotions of a stupidly captivated audience sink in, then moves on to another without bothering to connect them. It doesn't even bother to go anywhere significant with any event. Maybe real life is like that sometimes, but we don't go to the movies to see ourselves, to see the ordinary. We don't have to pay for it.I'm pro-choice and I hated this movie! If The Cider House Rules wins even ONE award (and it looks like that's going to be Best Supporting Actor for Michael Caine, who worked with a dialogue coach for two weeks and STILL couldn't even keep his accent consistent), we'll know it was bought, not won. Miramax's success at the 1998 Oscars showed the world that there is no such thing as a sure thing--or a fair thing, for that matter--in an Oscar race. Who knows how many surprises it has left? One thing that didn't come as a surprise: They released a movie this idiotic and insidious and got seven Oscar nominations. Life is peachy.",The Cider House Rules

(In a year end packed with a plethora of interesting films: Magnolia, Liberty Heights, Straight Story, et. al, Cider House really captured me).  Irving's fable of a youth's odyssey of becoming a man actually has a beginning, a middle and an end (sort of).  Nothing wrong with structure on occasion.  Strengths:  the Dickensian parallel, characters with shades of gray, the wonderful direction of Hallstrom, the great sense of place, the children, the marvelous acting of Caine, Maguire, Lindo, Theron (& others).

It's the right shape and color (black) for the era (circa 1943), but it's a dial telephone.  I'm not clear enough on the history of telephones to know exactly when dial phones began to be available, but I know that in many rural areas, dial phones did not become available until the early 1950's.  Maybe there were dial phones is big cities and suburbs in 1943, but it seems highly unlikely that there would be one in a poorly-funded orphanage in rural Maine (itself something of a backwater state).",The Cider House Rules

Then this orphan, weak in the heart, founds love, from the doctor, and care taker, from an unlikely girl.It is a sad movie with romance in the mix, and a bit of historical background since the war did take part in the endings of the movie. There are many questions that comes up from watching this. The problems of the society, the nature of people, in people left behind, loyalty from those left behind, the irresponsibility and frailty in people, and the cruelty in them. The doctor who resembles the fatherly love of boundless and endless proportion has in his mind the cruelty of people and lost hope from them but not the orphan whom he, the doctor made time to take care of.Afterwards what happens, when people, a couple, do an abortion, do we see regret? Do we see remorse, satisfaction, or perhaps nothing? Questions. At the later part of the story, we see why. Mistakes, and things do why they do this things. Religion also comes in to part in this. The story do tackle a lot of fragile subjects in our society.In terms of who should watch this, it is in my good perspective that the entertainment value of this is subjected for adults.

Many people believe that they have to deconstruct movies and find their weaknesses.  They need an incredible plot and they look at things like accent lapses and messages in the film to criticize.  This is a movie.  You go because you want to be entertained.  Michael Caine doesn't really run an orphanage and he's actually British.  You go to the movies to believe and to experience different things.See, I loved this and hated American Beauty, which I know you can't say now seeing as how it's everyone's favorite movie.

WHY is this movie so highly overrated, my dear americans? Is it because there is still such a taboo on abortion in America? Jee, time to grow up.

I was wondering how they would be able to squeeze 45 years of Homer Wells life into 15 months. I well John Irving made this happen. While captivating the key points in Homer Well's ""Doctor Life"" I felt some of the best sub-plots were left out. There was no mention of Melony, a key character in the book who teaches Homer about sex. My favorite subplot, Homer's son Angel, was also left out due to lack of time.

For a good film to watch on a winter's day, you should all run to see ""The Straight Story"" and skip this over-the-top-pull-your-heart-strings, (that ends up failing even at that).

This was a gritty portrayal of a hidden but real part of our past Americana, and in some ways of today as well.  The whole issue of ""what rules are for whom"" and ""what rules do you choose to govern yourself"" was deeply thought-provoking.  A feeling of isolation pervading various characters despite being with others was also intriguing.  And it seemed that it was within each character's own isolation that the question of rules was to be asked and decided.  (My head is beginning to hurt again.)

206,envity1981,"a good but also very manipulative brainwashing, and therefore a very dangerous movie",7,7 May 2017,"If I had children, I wouldn't allow them to watch this movie. Why? The entire movie is a propaganda for abortion. It only depicts pro-choice arguments. Pro-life arguments are completely left out.The most manipulative character in this movie is Doctor Wilbur who talks Homer into guilty feelings for being pro-life (""If this girl came to you few months earlier, and asked for an abortion, what would you have done? Nothing. You would have done nothing. And this happens by doing nothing"" (a girl is dying after a badly performed abortion by an amateur). Besides Dr Wilbur, all pro-choice people are the good guys, whilst all pro-life people are the baddies. Homer is an exception to this rule because in the end, he changes his mind and becomes an abortionist himself.Dear author of this movie and the book. There are foster parents in this world who do love their adopted children, and who would never raise their hands against them. And there are mothers who live happily ever after with their rape-children. If Charlize Theron's character actually wanted to have some children so much, why did she abort her first child in the first place? Oh, let me guess, she was just not ready yet for being a mother.I rate this movie with 7 stars for two reasons. When I was a teenager, I didn't fully understand the message of this film. To me, it was a beautifully made movie about a boy searching for a home and a family before realising that the orphanage has always been, and always will be his true home and family. Now that I'm older, I understand the manipulative message (""abortion is not a crime, and should be legalised""). Because of its one-sided message, I think this movie is indeed a very dangerous brainwashing movie. If the author's intent was the legalisation of abortion, then well done! It's legal now in many states and countries. On behalf of thousand millions of aborted babies, THANK YOU very much!! I hope, you can sleep with all those painful screams of unwanted babies.

In the cider house, Homer (Tobbey Maguire) discover some rules written in a paper nailed in the wall. The rules were there, all the time, but they were not respected since people there were not able to read. They were illiterate.The message here is so powerful, once it is a direct comparison with the Bible itself and the 10 rules written there for thousands of years. I would like to say I am completely against abortion based on my own convictions, but abortion is not the point here. Not to abort, or not to kill, is a rule, like the ones in the cider house walls. But when you are a doctor disposed to abort safely, intending to save someone which is intended to kill and also risking its own life in committing suicide? All that motivated as a victim of society's prejudice, of course! Are you disrespecting the rule?

If someone decides to come to St.Clouds he had made a much harder decision before that. Either he wants to leave a child here or he wants to take one with him. That's the only reason why someone would come to Dr. Larch (magnificent performed by Michael Caine), the chief of the orphanage. But under his management the orphanage had become also an harbourage for women who got undesirably pregnant. His job to guard over the kids is getting familial, when Homer Wells (convincingly played by Tobey Maguire) gets into his life.Their very intimate relationship is one of the most important things in this movie. It's a very close ""father-son"" relationship and that's also one of my personal favourite topics in this movie. But for every child comes the time when it wants to explore and discover the world. Since Homer was a child, he has been instructed by his mentor in medical science. Now, nearly grown up, its finally time for him to leave his protecting environment.He sees his chance come when the young woman (a beautiful and adorable Charlize Theron) wants to have an abortion. And from the that point Homer Wells' life is going to change completely. Far away from home he has to face new challenges of life. The different people he meets are of a very different origin and the foreign feelings are the wideband of human emotions: Anger, Fear, Pain and Love. I loved watching this movie, because I see his experiences which he makes as THE development we all have to pass in life: growing up !!!

I couldn't reasonably ask the filmmaker to balance his thoughts with alternative perspectives because it is his story but what I can ask is viewers to consider the power of the big screen to make you believe this situation is part of the greater narrative where art mimics life.For the record Abortion in America is counted less than 1% on account of rape and far less as a result of incest.The happy moments and memorable characters are just candy for a film that sets out to preach. Typical Hollywood overreach with familiar subject matter that will move a naive audience.

The subplots bear the cartoonish imprint of John Irving, in a way that makes it more difficult than it should be to suspend disbelief.Nevertheless, the performances are beautifully done.  Michael Caine is great in his customary fashion -- he breathes life into his role with honesty, humour, and the ease which surrounds the performances of many true artists.

The reason why is, when I saw a preview on TV, I said to myself ""well it doesn't look too bad, just a love story between Charlize Theron and Tobey Maguire...I was wrong.  And while it did involve a love story between the two, it was a very different movie; definitely one of the best dramas of the season.The story begins at an orphanage where Dr. Wilbur Larch (played excellently by Michael Caine in his first role with an American accent) delivers a small baby boy, like hundreds of times before, and puts him up for adoption with all the other boys and girls.  But this boy, named Homer, has a few problems with parents who try to adopt him.  Actually, the parents seem to have problems with him; the first set of parents were upset that he didn't cry (Dr. Larch says ""orphan babies never cry, they see no point in it""), and the second set of parents beat him, so he cried too much.Eventually Homer grew up in the orphanage, closer to Dr. Larch than all the other children, and eventually learns all the tricks in the trade to perform abortions and deliver orphan babies.  Homer is getting restless though, he knows that at his age (late adolesence) there is alot more to see in the world.  So he leaves one day, and hitches a ride ""to see the world"" with a young couple (Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron, both surprisingly very good).Tobey Maguire is certainly becoming a very talented actor, and although some would say is performance in ""Cider"" was easliy acted (he was a very mellow character), it definitley convinced me enough.  Michael Caine was great, as usual, and the accent was pretty solid too.  I could praise the whole cast individually, but let's just say they were on par with the cast of ""The Green Mile"".If you want to see a very beautifully filmed and emotionally involved drama this Oscar season, I urge one and all to see ""The Cider House Rules"".",The Cider House Rules

There is a purity about this movie and it comes from so many places not the least of which is the stunning Maine scenery, as well as the sparseness and closeness of the settings. The train station at the opening is bare. The orphanage is surrounded by forest. The apple farm is shot at close range, from above, only the buildings are seen.

In this case, rural Maine during World War II. It also puts you inside the head of its main character -- orphan and unlicensed doctor Homer Wells -- seeing things through his eyes. The story itself is full of the unanswerable questions of everyday life -- mainly who do you love and what do you do about it?

I had to go to the bathroom, otherwise I would have stayed in my seat.  nevertheless, i also stayed for awhile... )  Myotherrecommendation, (german word construction), is Ride With The Devil/ Other movies by Lasse Halstrom and Ang Lee are also good..",The Cider House Rules

Belgium has to wait until march to see this little treasure. This movie is a Gem.  A sparkling diamond full of compassion to the world surrounding us.This is exactly what we need right now.  This movie has so many beautiful things to show although the story isn't always this ""nice"" it is an extreme piece of art showing us what true compassion can bring to the world.John Irving must receive an oscar for an incredible tour de force translating such a great book to this script.  Of course you miss ""Melony"" and other characters from the novel but hey, this movie is the best Irving adaption ever and I sincerely hope John Irving keeps on writing for the movies too.The acting is simply outrageously good.  Michael Caine gives his best ever performance, Tobey IS HOMER WELLS, all other performances range from great to absolutely incredible not from this earth.Never becomes this movie a tearjerker, I even found some things were not shown ""dramaticly"" enough.I hope this movie doesn't drown in the bunch, and if it does I hope Miramax magicians can turn it into an oscar winner.  This movie is ""BEST OF THE YEAR"" without any doubts.  This is the warmest, most tender, HUMAN film you will ever see.  If our Human parts still work in this corrupted, cocooning society this should be an overall winner... Sceptics and cynics better stay home although they can use a portion of this masterwork.Thanks to Lasse, John, the cast and everyone who has worked on this great achievement.I hope ""to be of use"" with this critic..

I felt some areas of the plot were well developed and others weren't. I also felt that the director didn't leave enough time for the audience to fully connect to what was going on.

Many strong emotions are produced by the constantly changing moods of the story without any sappiness or false attempts to being a ""tear-jerker"". Michael Caine's portrayal of Dr. Larch has Oscar written all over it. Tobey Maguire CAN carry a movie and Charlize Theron continues to expand her range of characterizations.

I HATE THIS MOVIE!Somehow it tries to be a feel good tale about murder and abortion.  What a muddled mess.  This is one of the most morally confused films ever.  Now don't get me wrong.  I'm against abortion under most circumstances but I do believe that there is a case for it in the situation of rape and incest, so it wasn't it's pro-abortion message that particularly upset me.I suppose the problem is that the tone of the film is light and beautiful. There are many moments with the cute orphans and the kindly doctor and the idealistic hero that made me feel like I was really enjoying myself.  And then it hit me with incredibly harsh and cruel and ugly moments.  The ending was completely depressing.  I don't like the fact that the main character starts out with firm morals and ends up as shady as the doctor.And let me also say that the MPAA rating of PG-13 is an absolute joke.  I don't believe that any child should be allowed into this film.  Overt sexuality, nudity, violence, language, and moral ambiguity make this a movie for adults only, and I would recommend that adults shouldn't see it either.",The Cider House Rules

Michael Caine is very compelling and likable. But the edge and grit and details that make a period piece like this ring true just feel absent. It's an antiseptic universe.",The Cider House Rules

Nor will it be one that I will find myself watching again in the near future as it didn't have any kind of emotional impact on me. Pleasing to the eye; small moments where the film really is enjoyable; and an overall pleasant after-taste. No award-winning performances, but solid nonetheless.""Sometimes you gotta break some rules to put things straight."" Not something you can learn by observing someone else; not if your life is to be guided by that statement. That, in essence, is what I saw this film to be about. It's funny that some critics chose to jump on the abortion issue raised in the film. I chose to see it as simply an issue to show Homer's level of maturity and understanding of the world. Funny thing is: I'm not sure there really is any resolution on that particular issue and I believe it was the intention of the Director to leave it that way. Your opinion may differ, but that's the way I left it.I'm sure I'll watch again sometime... I just don't think I'll be rushing to do it.",The Cider House Rules

Everything is simple, obvious and pathetic. There are no real conflicts, everything decision is obvious, etc. It overplays emotions quite often. Just to give one example: The issue of abortion is one layer of the film, but it's very poorly addressed. It's way over simplified. Even though I'm pro-choice, I would have preferred a much more objective approach to the issue. The film refered to a few slogans that are floating around (incest and 'woman are going to have them anyway so they should at least do it properly'). It gives no thought to the other side of the issue (there are valid points there also). Acting is not really exceptional (except for the old doctor, who play quite well -- IMHO not at an Oscar level, but good anyway). It could have been a much better moview if the story had been ADOPTED in the broad sense (i.e. changed to reflect changes since the creation of the story). I don't think the orphans were portraied correctly, either. I got the impression that kids were happy in the orphanage and did not really want to be adopted (or at least they were neutral). The love story was based on cliches. Yes, as you can guess, I did not like the movie at all. Go to see if if you have nothing better to do and make up your mind. Probably you should wait for the video release (IMHO).",The Cider House Rules

The solid performances were its saving grace.  Tobey McGuire has an amazing gift of conveying honesty and strength, and the supporting characters added a wonderful richness to the film.  Most of all, I appreciate any movie that reminds us that, in the words of the band Rush, ""if you choose not to decide/you still have made a choice.""I recommend this film to those who enjoy drama and who can put aside the problems with its predictability.",The Cider House Rules

255,bmf jay,A whole lot of not much,3,14 January 2000,"""The Cider House Rules"" opened beautifully and magically only to resort to contrived plot twists and hokiness. Comparing this movie to the director's far superior ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" the coming of age hero didn't quite know if he was supposed to act like Depp or like DiCaprio. Maguire's subtle acting seemed at times that he may be mentally challenged.  Theron showed an opportunity to show her rosy cheeks.  She didn't show much of anything else in this movie.  She seemed lost in a movie without demons trying to take over her husband (The Astronaut's Wife and The Devil's Advocate).  I simply didn't care for any of the characters except the small children, who still seemed to be placed in for cuteness effects.  This movie is simply the failed equation that the producers believed would be failproof.  Beautiful Maine + stereotypical romantic story + cute orphan kids = Oscar potential.

Irving creates wonderful characters with redeeming (although sometimes eccentric) qualities...  characters that do give us hope and optimism.  The film is well made with wonderful actors of all ages. There is slight but not overbearing sentimentality in dealing with the subjects at hand. I appreciate Irving's courage in dealing with abortion in the 1940's decade.

Dr. Larch tried to create a world of his own in the orphanage as perfectly as he could.  To do so, he had to flout some regulations imposed by society. Homer had rules of his own, and had to learn that even his rules had exceptions.  To interpret the theme of this movie as being pro-choice is too narrow a view.

While this may be considered a ""chic flik"" by many - the underlying message is overwhelming. A great holiday movie demonstrating that regardless of your origins, most of us are loved by someone. Also it demonstrates that often the greatest enjoyment we may have in this life come from the very simple things we do well. Charlize Theron once again demonstrated her versatility as an actress. What initially appeared as a ditzy bimbo resulted in a very compassionate and complex character. She proved to be a great star.

Tobey Maguire has got to be one of the most gifted actors I have ever seen. His portrayal of Homer Wells is compelling. This movie will take you in during the very first scenes and won't let you go. When it's over you don't want to leave them all behind. Have you ever been so engrossed in a movie you don't realize what's going on around you. Cider House Rules is one of those rare films to come along and totally involve you in their lives. Maguire and Theron are wonderful along with the whole cast. Can't wait to see what other gifts Maguire gives us on the screen in the future.,The Cider House Rules
262,kevmac-2,Finally a John Irving movie that Hollywood didn't ruin!,9,8 January 2000,"Fans of the novels of John Irving will leave the theater after seeing ""Cider House Rules"" satisfied at long last that one of his books has been turned into a film that is almost as good as the book. The reason, of course, is that Irving himself wrote the screenplay and finally the quirky characters from his books are portrayed with some depth instead of as a bunch of loonies.Tobey Macguire as the main character Homer Wells turned in another wonderful performance, better even than he did as the spooky neighbor kid in ""American Beauty"". Michael Caine, who I am generally annoyed with due to his ""over the top"" performances, was at his best in his relatively subdued role as Dr. Wilbur Larch. The rest of the cast was good as well.The story takes place in the 1940's in St. Clouds, Maine at an orphanage run by the ether sniffing Dr. Larch (Caine). Larch, in his own words, tries to ""give women what they want"". If that means a delivered baby to be left in his care at the orphanage or an illegal abortion, he is willing to do it without judgement. He treats all of the children at the orphanage like his own but he pays special attention to the twice adopted, twice rejected Homer whom he trains to become a doctor. Homer is the oldest child at the orphanage and assists Dr Larch in both deliveries and abortions. He becomes morally opposed to the abortions and refuses to continue helping in the procedure in spite of Larch's repeated attempts to show him the necessity of the procedure.When a young couple, Walter and Candy (Theron and Rudd), come for an abortion he decides to pack his bags and leave with them, much to the sadness of the residents of the orphanage. He heads to the coast with Walter and Candy and gets a job at Walter's family orchard. There he lives with a group of migrant workers headed by Mr. Rose and his daughter Rose Rose. On the wall of the Cider House is a set of ridiculous rules and since Homer is the only one who can read they ask him to read them. Later in the story, after a major plot point, Homer finally does and Mr. Rose responds by saying basically, ""Those aren't our rules, we work here and we live here...we make our own rules.""Homer, falls in love with Candy after Walter leaves for the war and enjoys his life of apple picking and lobstering. He refuses to return to St. Clouds in spite of Larch's repeated pleadings and schemings but later in the story is confronted with the reality that his own set of rules or mores are not exactly set in stone and need to be re-vised somewhat. I won't give away any more than that. There aren't any real surprise endings but the whole thing comes to a very satisfying conclusion.A lot of people will find the message of this movie very disturbing and probably dislike it for that reason. I've read every one of Irving's novels and I find myself generally on the opposite side of every moral and political issue that Irving puts forth. At the same time I am captivated by every story. Since I am pro-life, I found Cider House Rules one of the most disturbing books I have ever read and also one of my favorites. The movie affected me the same way. I can really identify with Homer and although my set of rules have not had to be as dramatically altered as his, they have been adapted and modified along the way. You have to see this movie with an open mind to appreciate it.A very good movie and so nice to see a book that Hollywood didn't ruin!",The Cider House Rules

This film tells a wonderful and innocent tale of a young mans search for direction in his sheltered life.  This is not merely a film about abortion, and those that think that are being shortsighted.  Homer could have been given the skill of anything surgical and it would have fit the film to some extent.  Michael Caine was superb, however i think that many overlooked the wonderful performance of one of my favorite actors, Delroy Lindo.

266,dgag2257,Cider House Rules - rules were made to be broken,8,13 September 2006,"The theme of the movie is the Rules that are posted in the Cider House, that Homer, the chief protagonist, runs away to. The rules are so outrageous that one really wonders why they were made in the first place. By beginning the story in Dr Larch's orphanage / abortion clinic, the writer wishes to suggest that the rules regarding abortion are equally outrageous. Candy, who lives at Cider House, comes to Dr Larch's clinic for an abortion, to get rid of the baby she has conceived through Wally before marriage. Homer, a grown-up orphan, and Dr Larch's protégé, leaves the clinic to go and live in the Cider House. He has never seen the world, and wants a taste of it. He thinks he will find something different there, and something less sordid. Unfortunately here he is confronted by people with passions and emotions who actually make a place like Dr Larch's clinic possible. It is because of sordid relationships in the outside world (like the one of Rose and her father's) that abortions become necessary. All the separate stories in the movie are subtly woven around the title 'The Cider House Rules'. They are the stories of Dr Larch's orphanage and clinic, the going's on at Cider House amongst the black workers, Candy and Wally's story and Homer's search for a different life. After his experience of helping Rose to get an abortion because of her conception of a child borne of incest, he realizes that he could do something meaningful if he went back to his surrogate father's clinic and performed abortions - which he previously religiously criticized. The title of the movie is very apt, and is the cement that holds all the stories together. There is nothing disjointed in the various plots - they all cohere in a powerful whole with the return of Homer to Dr Larch's clinic. Only now, since Dr Larch has died, he has to take over. And he does so with aplomb. Fantastically underplayed performances by Michael Caine (Dr Larch) and Tobey Maguire (Homer).",The Cider House Rules

While it is a reasonably well-made film with a solid cast, it serves as nothing more than a platform for the filmmaker to shove a pro-abortion message down the throat of the viewer.  If an anti-abortion film with just as strong a cast was ever made, it would be decried as an attempt by the Christian right to propagate its message.  Hollywood made its message loud and clear in this brazen piece of anti-life propaganda. What's even worse is that this trash was nominated for, and actually won, awards.",The Cider House Rules

I would read ""The Cider House Rules"" and, if I enjoy it, I would watch the film, which I knew had won 2 Oscars. The plan fulfilled, I can tell you now that I hated the movie almost as much as I loved the book. This is a classic case of ""great book - bad movie"". John Irving's adaptation of his own book is probably the next worst case after ""The Magus"", a movie made in the late 60's based on the novel of the same title by John Fowles. Indeed, what would you think of a book adaptation for the screen if it - skims the surface of the plot barely touching the real story; - crams the first half of the book into the first 10 minutes of movie time (with the cast and credits popping up at appropriate intervals), throws half of the characters out of the story (including the most interestingly controversial one  Melony), dwells for one and a half hours on an uninspired love-story line and just omits the last third of the book; - compacts 20 (well written!) years of the main character's life into an incomprehensible gooey mass of disconnected events, unmotivated actions and lackluster emotions and never allows the protagonist grow beyond confused boyhood (the original book ends when he is forty!). I felt sorry of John Irving. Honestly! I would have never touched the book had I seen the film first. Fortunately, my plan was in reverse order.

He has been taught about doctoring and abortion by the less-than-perfect Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who sees nothing of forging degrees for Homer (Maguire) in order to establish him as the doctor who will take over the orphanage. However, Homer longs for something else being a doctor will not give him, and so leaves the orphanage with Candy and Wally (Charlize Theron and Paul Rudd), a couple who have arrived for an abortion.The story revolves around Homer's adventures and discoveries, with bittersweet portrayals of each character and evoking powerful emotions within the audience. The only bone I have to pick with it is that at the end of the movie, you are left with a vague idea of what the movie is really about - but not a complete view. It appears that the movie itself does not really know what message it is trying to give, which is a shame for it is a beautiful movie in all other aspects.Great acting from Michael Caine and even from the orphanage boys.",The Cider House Rules

Fed up with this existence, he decides to travel south, with a serving air force pilot and his girlfriend. He ends on a cider plant, picking apples. One summer, he finds that one of the African American pickers, Rose Rose has become pregnant by her father.

Charlize Theron who is always a great actress didn't lower my expectations of her at all. The only thing wrong with the movie is that her and Paul Rudd didn't really to seem to have any chemistry.

In order to make a fairly reasonable point about abortion, (ignoring anyone's personal stand for the moment), Updike and all use a group of migrant black orchard workers to make a point: when the rules make no sense, you have to break the rules.  Now here's the sticker - the rules the white protagonist has to break, against his original conscience, are ones which make him seem compassionate.  The rules broken by the black characters are incest-taboos.  My jaw dropped lower and ever-lower as I struggled to keep both my incredulity and my anger in check.  From Delroy Lindo's character repeating over and over again: ""Not our rules"", from the ""noble savage/savage negro"" portrayals, to the whole 'white man's burden' plot, there are only two questions:1. Why in the world would any black actor not desperate for their SAG card get involved in this, and 2. How did this piece of upper-class liberal racism win any awards?Sheesh.",The Cider House Rules

I think Charlize Theron's character could have been developed a bit more, and the ending made me want to know what happens next (I get the idea that in the book, we find out)...beautiful scenery and, overall, a worthwhile film.",The Cider House Rules
278,gdickelman,"Finally, a movie of a John Irving novel that captures his narrative voice.",10,25 December 1999,"I'm pleased that a movie adaptation of a John Irving novel has finally underscored the power and poignancy of his narrative voice. Previous movies (notably The Hotel New Hampshire and The World According to Garp) seem to have had an unbalanced focus on the comedic elements. While these are mostly accurate and entertaining, Irving doesn't write for the purpose of being funny. He helps us to observe aspects of relationships and life in unique ways that we often find funny. I find that his stories, in absence of his narrative voice, miss the point (his point).The Cider House Rules, on the other hand, captures the essence of the novel, most notably through Michael Caine's voice-overs and dialogue. This is a credit to both Irving and Hallstroem for, respectively, an outstanding screenplay and superb directing. The Cider House Rules is now my favorite movie, and the best I've seen in years. Congratulations to Irving, Hallstroem, and the entire *perfect* cast, who are Irving's characters. I think Toby Maguire was born to be Homer Wells.",The Cider House Rules

He wrote the screenplay, and so must be happy with it; as a viewer, I was left wondering if we were meant to get a message about abortion or a larger, more profound sense of finding one's niche in the world.

280,marovich,A highly over rated movie which did not even deserve Best Picture Nomination.,6,15 April 2000,"This is a movie where Tobey Maguire establishes himself as a fine young actor.  Michael Cain plays his role to perfection and I was very happy to see him win best supporting actor as he well deserved it.  Unfortunately the director of the picture (Lasse Hallström) took money from Planned Parenthood to produce this film.  This pushed the film into almost sheer advertisement at moments in the movie.  He goes off in the story with a hard political agenda rather than staying in the plotline of the story.  As his intentions were to make you think about the legality of abortion, he did succeed in his goal.  But to sacrifice a large portion of a good story to focus on the point loses many people who have watched this movie.If you are pro choice, you will love this movie.  If you are not, this is a movie you should stay away from.  It is a shame that such a great concept could break a movie like this upon political lines.  As most of liberal hollywood agrees with the abortion factor, this movie was higher rated than it probably should have been.Personally I enjoyed the picture, but as many associates and friends of mine thought lesser things of this movie, I could not allow myself to give this picture high marks.",The Cider House Rules

But it was marred by a completely extraneous, heavy pro-choice sermon woven into the storyline.  (Indeed, I had a hard time deciding whether this was an abortion movie with a story of self-discovery, or a movie about self-discovery with an abortion message.)  Even the cider house ""rules"" imply the right of the woman not to be bound by society's rules.  I resent that I paid money to be captive audience to the pro-choice rant.

Everyone is unhappy when the cute boy decides to leave his orphanage and live a life of his own. The boy does a lot of good things out in the big world, too. He gives wise advise, ""do like this and like that"". He is soo perfect.The ending scene tops it all. The cute boy decides to return. Strings, mushy music, no eye in the audience is dry.

287,mckaty,"The Cider House Rules is a ""lukewarm"" movie",8,20 March 2000,"Are you against of the abort, or in favor ? Do you agree that youngs know contraceptive methods to practise abort to get rid themselves of an undesired pregnancy ? And in case of pregnancy resultant of incest or rape ? Would you be in favor ? These questions are approached, not very much, in the movie The Cider House Rules, nominated to Oscar best picture in this year. The movie tells Homer Wells' (Tobey Maguire) saga, a young that lives in an orphanage in Maine, that leaves in search of definition his proper values in order to tread his proper destiny. Without parents, Homer lives in the orphanage under the guardianship of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), a gynecologist, vitiated to ether, that practices illegal aborts. The doctor educates Homer to be his successor, but the young, that was against the practical of abort and wanted to seek his place in the world by himself, decides to leave the orphanage to know the world with his proper eyes. He catches hitchhiking with the couple Wally (Paul Rudd) and Candy (Charlize Theron), that had been in Dr. Larch's clinic for an abort. Homer is going to work as picker of apples in Wally's mother farm. During his adventure, the young knows the love and also finishes needing to review his position about the abort. Although the thematic is very interesting - independence in the choice of the proper destiny -, besides involving controversies questions (another subject that appears in tram is the incest), The Cider House Rules is a ""lukewarm"" movie. You leave the movies thinking that could have seen a much better movie, more disturbing movie. Despite the good argument, the movie does not have great dialogues or discussions, losing an excellent chance of constructing intense debates. When approaching the abort, the director Lasse Hallström stands ""in top of the wall"", not arriving at the ""x"" of the question. It is not evident, for example, in the end of the movie, if Homer Wells changed your position about the subject. Apparently, he became favorable, but everything is very implicit. Thus, The Cider House Rules is very far his competitors in the dispute for the Oscar. It is not afflictive, distressing as The Green Mile, nor disturbing as The Sixth Sense, much less, so bold, forceful and direct as American Beauty. It is only ""little pretty"". Therefore, its nomination to Oscar already was an award more than enough.",The Cider House Rules

293,lewisp,Unusually and unbelievably; even more powerful than the book,9,1 November 2001,"I'd read the book four or five times. I'd heard the soundtrack album four or five times. I was very fond of them both in isolation. I love John Irving's books.I was, therefore, stunned to find that it is one of the only adaptations to film I found more powerful than the novel.I love the narrative style Irving uses in print; rambling, all-encompassing and wonderfully descriptive.  His books wouldn't seem to lend themselves easily to the, necessarily more succinct medium of film, let alone the modern propensity for ""action"" that film seems to demand.  Herein lies the real trick of this film.  The beautiful shooting, great use of music and sympathetic performances from the cast merely (!) close the circle started by the fact that all the right plot-lines were retained from the book. Some of the sideshows were, correctly, left well alone.Looking back on Irving's books, and this film in particular, it's easy to forget that ""action"" does happen in them!  A simple list of subjects contained in The Cider House Rules would show incest, betrayal, abortion, murder, love, sex, deception and addiction and yet, who would describe the film as ""action-packed""?  This is because it's most enduring qualities lie elsewhere.It's beautiful as only complete things can be. It's thought-provoking. It doesn't leave inconveniently difficult stones unturned. Oh yes, it also made me (unashamedly) cry, for the first time in years.  Personally, I loved it...",The Cider House Rules
294,orourkej,"Simple Joy, Not for the Shallow",10,5 December 2001,"Cider House Rules is a tale of simple joy, of father and son, of unrequited love, of morality and of rules. It's a touching tale of orphans, specifically Homer Wells and his discovery of life outside of St. Cloud. There's much to be taken from this film for viewers of many ages, although children probably won't be prepared to enjoy it.While they are not biologically related, they enjoy and suffer many of the slings and arrows that a father and son would Wilbur loves Homer and gives him what he can, which is hope, protection and `near-perfect obstetrical procedure'. As children do, Homer resists Larch's goals for him, specifically to assume Larch's role as a doctor in the orphanage. Instead Homer ventures away when a convenient opportunity presents itself in the form of a young couple leaving after the woman had an abortion. The couple, Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington, are Homer's age but much more worldly. It is here where Homer's simple appreciation of the world is apparent and most appealing. He had never seen the ocean and so Wally and Candy show Homer the Atlantic. Candy will later show Homer a drive in movie theater, which Homer professes to love, despite it never being open . Homer looked forward to a career picking apples, typically reserved for migrants, and didn't think anything of living with the migrants in the cider house. He finds joy in every aspect of life at the orchard, while others find misery in the same setting. I admire Homer's approach and seek to find more joy in the mundane, every day occurrences that we are so often too busy to even notice.It is the rules from which the film, and novel, derive their title. Literally put, there is a set of rules posted in the cider house that are meant for the migrant workers. However, the workers cannot read, and so the rules are ignored in favor of their own unwritten rules. Many of the migrants' rules are governed by the deft knife of Mr. Rose, the foreman of the migrant workers. It is Homer that will reveal to the workers what the rules actually say, and unwittingly, it is Mr. Rose that will ultimately convince him of things that Dr. Larch had only tried to.It would be incomplete to review the film without mentioning the abortion issue, and yet it would be unfair to suggest that this is all the film is about. Dr. Larch accepts as the Lord's work to carry out whatever the women arriving at St Cloud's want. This is to say that he delivers babies when asked, and performs abortions (at a time when they are illegal) for those that aren't `quick', or too far developed. This is important to him as he is well trained and carries out the abortions safely while other women take matters into their own hands, often with dangerous and lethal results. Despite his best efforts, Dr. Larch never is able to convince Homer to perform abortions.The film and the book are not the same- the book is simply far too long to include everything. Homer's childhood is largely lost in the film, accounted for instead by a montage in the opening scenes and the introduction of Buster who reveals some of what Homer was as a child in the novel. Among the most notable differences are the absence of Melony and the chronology of the movie. Melony is a major character in the novel, only surpassed by Dr. Larch and Homer. She was a very powerful character, and Irving feared she'd overpower others in the film, especially since Michael Caine wanted to play a softer Dr. Larch. As for the time frame, the movie is greatly compressed. Whereas the book took place over several decades, and Homer leaves the orphanage for 15 years, the film takes place over 15 months. This requires of course some things to change- in the film Candy is the sexual aggressor, the war is already in force, and the origin of Larch's ether addiction is a mystery. More significantly, Homer is a part of the Worthington family in the novel, becoming close friends with Wally, living in the `fancy house', becoming Olive's pseudo-son, and becomes the boss of Ocean View. Finally, Angel Wells (Candy and Homer's child) is absent in the film adaptation.This is not to say that the film is delinquent. These omissions and changes were necessary to present the story in a film version, and thus the film is a faithful adaptation of John Irving's 1985 novel. It ought to be, because Irving adapted the novel for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts.This is not a fluffy movie to half pay attention to while doing something else. To do so may lead you to think like some of the other reviewers here, that its simply a story about abortion and nothing else. If you finish this movie and think that way, watch it again because you've missed a lot.",The Cider House Rules

296,hewitt06,"An orphan who wants to find his own way, leaves everything he knows behind to live life in a way he has never known before.",9,29 July 2010,"Homer played by Toby McGwire is the orphan who is favored by the head of the orphanage Dr. Larch (Michael Caine). Homer leaves with Candy (Charlize Theron) and goes on life journey to realize who he wants to be.This movie is about a boy who has had practically nothing but still has a good head on his shoulders. All he really wants to do is find his own place in the world. Dr. Larch owns the orphanage and he also does illegal abortions on the side. Candy comes into the picture when she comes to get an abortion. Homer is the doctors help in the clinic, but he refuses to do abortions. The doctor believes he is helping the women and the children so that the children do not have to grow up without a home. Homer refuses to believe growing up where he did is worse than never experiencing life. Ironically, abortion is what brought Homer and Candy together. The film brought in several different emotions and was very powerful. The costumes and even the props down to pictures on the walls were believably from the 40's time period. Everything down to the lighting was perfect to portray this period and draw you in. By using a soft colored tone throughout the movie, we were better able to emotionally connect. The lighting was perfect scene by scene. The orphanage is made to look a little darker and more sad. Especially in the scenes where they film the orphans talking at night. The lighting on the beach was bright and made us excited when Homer saw the beach for the first time. They used the right amount of light to portray sadness as they did to portray happiness. The settings always allowed us to relate to the emotions of the movie. I think the settings and lighting went hand in hand in allowing us to feel what they were feeling. The beautiful beach and how it was lighted up so bright and the orphanage and how it was far away and dark and dim are examples of this. The director uses the camera angle nicely and the zoom feature a lot to draw attention to the important parts of scenes. When Homer is the bedroom with Candy everything around him is dark and you can only focus on him while the camera slowly zooms in. The director catches the emotions of the actors with close ups also. Overall I loved this movie. It really did John Irving's book justice. Finding yourself and getting the most out of life as a theme seem to fit perfectly.",The Cider House Rules
297,chanda_gelin,"Wow, What a great movie!",10,19 September 2010,"The Cedar House Rules is definitely a movie you would want to see. The movie has a great story line and even better actors. If you are used to movies that are in color, you will have doubts about this movie when it first comes on. This movie starts off Black and White, and then will change to color. The two colors will then switch between the two extremes throughout the film. My advice: have patience and don't rule this movie out, you will have missed out on a classic. While there are many great characters in the movie, the main characters include: Tobey Maguire who played Homer Wells, Charlize Theron who played Candy Kendall, Paul Rudd who played Lt. Wally Worthington, and Michael Caine who played Dr. Wilbur Larch.The Cedar House is about Homer Wells who didn't have any direction in life. He had been raised in an orphanage and never saw anything outside the four walls of the building. The only reality he had was the movie that they were able to see every Friday. The proof that Homer never went anywhere is that Homer didn't even know what the ocean looked like. He never knew what a drive-in movie looked like, until Candy took him to one. And lastly, he had never seen an apple tree, until he got a job at Wally's mothers business, picking apples.The Cedar House Rules is centered on Homer Wells. Homer was an orphan at St. Cloud orphanage, at which place, he was adopted and then returned to the orphanage four times. After the fourth time returned back to the orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch who was a Doctor at the orphanage decided to raise him and taught Homer how to be a Doctor. Dr. Larch taught Homer how to deliver babies and how to perform abortions (which Homer refused to perform). The movie takes a different turn when Wally brings his girlfriend Candy in to have an abortion. At this time, Homer interviews both of them in a room and tells them that Dr. Larch will perform the procedure. After Candy has the procedure and is resting, Homer looks out the window and sees Wally standing outside next to his car. Homer than mustards up the strength to ask Wally can he leave with him and Candy when they leave. After Wally said yes, the rest is history. Wally goes back to the Military and Homer and Candy fall in love. Homer then meets Rose Rose who was an apple picker, who ends up getting impregnated by her own father. Homer, who wants to help her, finds himself giving her something that he vowed he wasn't going to perform, an abortion. He then realizes that he is a Doctor (unlicensed), and goes back to the St. Cloud orphanage and becomes the Doctor there when Dr. Larch died.Another film that is close in appropriateness is The lover. The two movies are similar because while The Cedar House Rules is based out of an orphanage, The Lover is based out of a boarding school. While Homer falls in love with Candy, Jane March falls in love with a Chinaman (Tony Leung Ka Fai). Both Homer and Jane fell in love with someone thinking they would feel the void that is within them, and they both were wrong. The issue with both of them was deeper. They needed to address the issue of loneliness that had been there since their abandonment. And the last similarity between the two movies is that both relationships didn't end with a happy ending. They both wanted the relationship to continue, which the other partners didn't.The lightning in the movie was subtle. The movie used very little artificial light. The movie mainly utilized natural light. For example, in the scene when Homer was reading to the other children in the orphanage, the light in the room was off. But since the room had windows, you could actually see the light gleaming in through the windows, thus creating a shadowing effect in the room. In the scenes where the landscape was outside, such as when Homer was at the drive-in with Candy, natural light was utilized also.The angles that were used in this movie varied greatly. In the scene where Homer and Candy were having sex outside, the angle was from the side and then moved to the top of them. In this scene the camera remain in a close-up position. In the scene were the kids from the orphanage played in the snow outside, the camera keep at a distance. The angle continually changed. The angled looked as though it was moving around the children. It was as though the director wanted us to see exactly how many children were playing outside.In conclusion, this was a great film to review. The movie will make you laugh at times and it will also make you cry at times. If you like movies that are reality based, you will love this movie. Young Homer that was unwanted in life and told that he would never make it out in the ""real"" world figure out one thing on his own, that he wanted to be doctor. He chose to do, what he fought so hard not to do, abortions. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the film.",The Cider House Rules
298,roth11,The Cider House Rules: Review and Synopsis,7,3 February 2011,"Adapted from the book by John Irving, this coming of age film is set in the early 1940's. America was still recovering from the Great Depression when we became involved WWII. Men were off at war while women entered the workforce to replace those men. The Cider House Rules occurs in two settings: St. Clouds and the orphanage and an apple orchard in the small farming town of Cape Kenneth. At the orphanage, people visit to either adopt a child or receive an illegal abortion. Michael Caine, as Dr. Larch, runs the orphanage. Tobey Maguire plays Dr. Larch's protégé, Homer Wells. Dr. Larch, having raised Homer, wishes Homer to replace him as head of the orphanage. Homer, desiring to spread his wings and find his place in the world, leaves the orphanage to find his own dreams. Homer and Dr. Larch have one major area in which they disagree: the right for women to obtain an abortion. Throughout the film, as Homer engages in a love affair with a Candy Kendall (played by Charlize Theron) whose boyfriend is off at war, Homer and Dr. Larch continue this disagreement via the postal service. Eventually, Homer must confront his beliefs when he is faced with a young lady who is pregnant by her father. Homer's heart grows three sizes that day, and once Dr. Larch has passed, he returns to the orphanage to fulfill the role Dr. Larch always wanted him to fill.Unlike other coming of age films like The Graduate, the navel gazing Homer does is more about society and individual rights rather than deciding trivial things (in comparison) such as what career or personal relationship to pursue. Similar to The Graduate, the film uses the vehicle of a love story to unfold the plot of a young man's search for self. As Homer becomes involved with Candy, he experiences the irony of having a sexual relationship and not worrying about consequences. While Homer does not impregnate Candy, he still faces a difficult pregnancy decision in the form of Rose Rose (played by Erykah Badu). Rose is impregnated by her father and (obviously) does not wish to have the baby. Her father will not let her leave, she cannot take care of a baby, and she considers taking care of it herself. Homer, having seen the horrific results of botched abortions, makes the decision to help Rose and performs the abortion himself. It is at this point that Homer realizes that the world is imperfect and if women insist on abortion they should be able to receive them safely.The film was shot on location and therefore uses natural sources when possible. Additionally, the film stock and filters used give the scenes a softness that hearkens back to simpler times and life in the country. This softness also helps detract from the harshness of the abortion debate running throughout the film. The lighting and filters softens everything just enough to allow the viewer to sit back and enjoy the film without becoming too uncomfortable watching abortions occur and allowing the viewer to relax and discover how Homer's search for meaning unfolds.",The Cider House Rules
299,allenr01,A coming of age film that requires a nonjudgmental stance,7,1 May 2011,"The Cider House Rules is the story of a young man named Homer Wells (Toby McGuire) that is born and raised in an orphanage in rural Maine, and is groomed to take over the spot of the resident doctor and abortionist Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Homer leaves the orphanage with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) a young couple that comes to the orphanage for an abortion, to find his own way in the world. Life circumstances eventually bring Homer home to the orphanage where he finally agrees to take Dr. Larch's place as the doctor at the orphanage.This movie is a coming of age movie centered on the idea that you should not judge the actions taken by others in a situation that you have never been in and are not likely to understand. Similarly the affair between two of the main characters Homer and Candy while Wally is away at war can also be seen as a situation that others are unlikely to understand because they are not in the same situation. The inappropriate relationship between Homer and Candy is similar to the inappropriate relationship between a teenager and her best friend's father in the coming of age movie American Beauty.The motif in this film is seen repeatedly in the situation with Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), in that like the abortions Dr. Larch is performing for the women who come to the orphanage a person is unlikely to understand their distinct situation and therefore should not judge. This is apparent in Mr. Rose's comment to Homer about the situation with Rose Rose, ""This ain't your business."" The lighting in The Cider House Rules is very soft and subtle, almost muted in the beginning of the film when Homer is living at the orphanage and then becomes brighter and crisper when he goes out into the world and finds himself. Like the theme of the movie the lighting is softer and more muted when Homer is still a young boy but as he grows and comes of age and his path becomes more clear to him, the lighting brightens and becomes clearer as well. This film is rife with moral ambiguity and will have you questioning your stance on everything from abortion to infidelity; however it is not my place to judge.",The Cider House Rules
300,deanmcknight,"The Main character of this film, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), is an orphan whom grew up in an orphanage in St. Cloud's Maine.",7,21 June 2011,"Film Review for Cider House RulesThe Main character of this film, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), is an orphan whom grew up in an orphanage in St. Cloud's Maine. Homer was adopted a couple of times and returned both times. He was not a fit for the adopting parents and they were not a fit for him. The head of the orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), sort of become a father figure to Homer and he unofficially and informally trains Homer in Obstetrics and performing abortions. Homer never even attended high school. Dr. Larch is addicted to ether and shows him using it throughout the film. Homer does not like performing abortions. The theme consists of a boy growing up in a orphanage and is taken under the wing of the director (doctor) of the facility and trained to be a doctor in obstetrics and is looking for something different in life. He finds out that life is complex and finally decides to return to the orphanage, because he realizes that it is meant for him to be a doctor like his mentor. Throughout the film Homer befriends Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and leaves the orphanage with them after Candy receives an abortion. They take Homer to their family's apple orchid where he works. Then Wally goes overseas during World War II. Homer and Candy begins to have an affair. Wally's plane is shot down and returns home paralyzed. Homer is picking apples with black workers and is staying at the Worthington Estate in the Cider House. The workers are supervised by Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo). Mr. Rose gets his own daughter pregnant named Rose Rose (Erykah Badu). Homer does not do abortions, but eventually does one in Rose's case. She wants to leave and she stabs her father, because she thought he was trying to touch her. Arthur tells Homer and another worker to tell the law that it was a suicide. Homer learns of Dr. Larch's death due to an overdose of ether and decides to return to the St. Cloud Orphanage and takes his place there. Another film by Irving is The World According to Garp which has an appropriateness to theme. This consists of love, drama,and tragedy. Thus, showing some similarities of the two films. The lighting of The Cider House Rules seems to show the relevance of the theme in regards to the mood and atmosphere. The orphanage lighting seems somewhat dim to display the underfunding and sadness of the parent less children. However, there was a good portion of natural light. The natural light that appears in the outdoor scenes and in the cider house; shows that there is friendship, love and just the warm feeling of the environment. The Motif of the film which included mainly the beauty of the natural environment along with the sounds and the array of beautiful colors that constantly appears throughout the film. The theme consists a great deal of morale issues and complexity of relationships.",The Cider House Rules
301,wrigha01,The theme of this film is that your heart always brings you back to where you're supposed to be.,8,7 December 2011,"Film: The Cider House Rules Release Date: December 10th, 2011 Starring: Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd, Delroy Lindo Director: Lasse Hallstom Synopsis: The film The Cider House Rules begins with Tobey Maguire's character Homer growing up in an orphanage and following in the footsteps of Michael Caine's character Wilbur. Wilbur is a doctor that performs abortion's which was highly frowned upon during this era. Homer learns the ropes while still yearning to experience the real world outside of the orphanage, all while Wilbur dreams that Homer will partner with him and ultimately takeover when he is gone. The theme of this film is that your heart always brings you back to where you're supposed to be. For example, Homer enjoyed leaving the orphanage and falling in love with Charlize Theron's character Candy, but knew in the end he had a responsibility to the patients and children of the orphanage and returned. Homer had the chance to experience life outside of his normal routine and realized that his abilities and gift to be able to help women in need when faced with an unwanted child was bigger than being in love for a short period of time. During Homer's journey working on the apple farm he is forced to help a young woman named Rose. Rose was raped by her father (Delroy Lindo), and Homer performs the abortion on Rose so that she does not have to live with the memory of her father molesting her throughout her lifetime. After the surgery is over Rose runs from the apple farm without looking back, after her father realized he ruined a large part of her life, he takes his own life. While these dramatic events are taking place Homer is informed that the other man in Candy's life Wally (Paul Rudd) is coming back from serving in the military, because he was injured and is paralyzed from the waist down. Once Homer realizes that Candy needs to be there for Wally he decides to return to the orphanage and use his gift of surgery to good use. The lighting in this film is more high-key because many scenes are taking place in an infirmary type location. The lights are bright so the audience can further their imagination to the stress and realism to what these women and medical staff are experiencing. Also the angle used during the film is mainly filmed straight on, because the lack of action packed scenes. This film is realistic, so to really get the audience involved it is best to keep it simple and believable. A film related to the theme of The Cider House Rules is another film directed by Hallstrom, What's Eating Gilbert Grape. These two films revolve around being there for your friends and family when needed. Hallstrom does an excellent job portraying that you have to take the good with the bad in both of these films. For example, in The Cider House Rules Homer knows that abortion is frowned upon but outweighs the bad and thinks of the women faced with the issue. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape this family would not be considered a normal family, but this family sticks together through the good and the bad. Overall, these films both portray that every situation can have a positive or negative result but in the end your heart will lead you where you need to be.",The Cider House Rules
302,jacob-dockus,Homer's path to life,9,7 December 2011,"The film The Cider House Rules is based on the novel written by John Irving. It the story of Homer Wells (played by Tobey Maguire) who is trying to figure out what he wants to do in life. He has grown up in an orphanage, and decides to leave the place he was called home for his entire life. Dr. Wilbur Larch (played by Michael Caine) is reluctant to this idea, but Homer is an adult and makes the decision to leave. He travels with Candy Kendall (played by Charlize Theron) and Wally to his family orchard where Homer becomes a worker picking apples. This is Homer's first real taste of life outside the orphanage and is exposed to things like violence, love, sex, and freedom for the first time. During this time Dr. Larch is trying to get Homer to return to be the head physician at the orphanage without directly asking. In the end Homer does return only to find out some things have changed. This film The film is brilliantly shot to resemble the 1940s in America. The clothing and buildings is all representative of the time period. The beliefs on abortions child birth are also representative of the time period. The plot revolves around Homer, and is about him trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. The lighting and color are soft which adds to emotions of the film. The narration at the beginning of the film really sets a tone for the audiences' emotions and was played a significant role in getting the story and giving the emotion to go with it. This may not be Spiderman for Toby McGuire but still one of his best performances.In conclusion this is an amazing film, with great actors and crew. It takes place during the 1940s. It tells the tale of Homer Wells picking a direction in his life outside of the place he grew up in, and finally returning to the orphanage after experiencing many new things, and meeting several different kinds of people along the way.",The Cider House Rules
303,GRANDBROTHERS,Generally Good,8,21 February 2005,"This movie can be split to distinct parts according to speed of events and place of events. The initial parts of the movie, where Micheal Caine -no doubt- proves to be a great actor, is in my opinion best parts of the movie. Some people may find those scenes melodramatic but I think they are actually what a drama should contain. The life and hopes of the children and the way that a idealist doctor behaves them is emotionally emphasized. However I find the second half a bit slow. I think there was no need to put an incest theme or repeat similar events concerning the life of workers. Such branching in scenario made the movie at least half an hour longer than it ought to be. However the parts that were related to Homer's decisions to discover life outside the local limited area he grew up, and similarly his last decision to find out where actually his soul belongs to where praise worthy. Eventually I recommend this movie to all drama lovers despite some small mistakes...",The Cider House Rules
304,leahzerilli,Cider House Sucks,1,1 April 2014,"Upon hearing so much praise for this title for so long I was excited to watch it with my husband. I was sorely disappointed in the moral and ethical themes of this movie. Supporting abortion is fairly thrust upon the viewers. Pro-life views are seen as ignorant and naive. The apparent message of this film is that ""we make our own rules"", that if one feels that a rule is unjust or unneeded, it can be discarded. Pro-Life and Pro-Choice advocates alike should be able to agree that this theme is absurd as well as dangerous. The audience is also made feel that lust equals love and to feel sympathetic towards a woman who is cheating on her boyfriend while he is away fighting overseas because she ""isn't good at being alone."" Cry me a river. As we also find out at the end of the movie, Michael Caine's character has falsified Homer's medical records in order to disqualify him for military service service. How many other parents in America would have liked to give inaccurate x-rays to the Army in order to keep their sons home safe? This film was a disgrace.",The Cider House Rules
305,dwweidner,The story of people and the ideas behind their choices in life and love.,10,4 June 2005,"This film is so wonderful, because it allows you to think about what you believe, as apposed to what others want you to think. The issue of abortion lets the women choose what they want, to either risk giving a child a chance of living a loving life, or hurtful one with no love, or to abort, giving the child an eternal peace. Conservatives would believe there is no love without life, while Liberals would believe there is no life without love. Tobey Mcguire did a fantastic job at portraying Homer, a man who needs to search for the life he's looking for, after living at the orphanage his whole life, and along the way realizes he is needed by many people, whether they are at the new world or back at the orphanage. Michael Cain also did marvelously as Wilbur and I congratulate him on his Oscar. This movie is so difficult to watch, because it is so sad on many levels, including heart-braking deaths, incest, suicide, and worst of all, having to give up on those you love. But the film is beautiful in a way, showing that you will have to make choices in life, whether its to abort or not, or if its to decide if you want to be a doctor or pick apples, ha, its still great to see.""Goodnight you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England...""",The Cider House Rules
306,linspark,Home in the Cider House Rules and Homer's Odyssey,10,30 January 2007,"I found ""The Cider House Rules"" to be a film I have watched over and over I am never ceased to be amazed at Homer Well's Odyssey and how he finds himself as a true medical healer in the dark world of the colored people and incest in the Cider House \Candy Kendall is (I think) a conflation of the two minor goddesses in Homer's ""Odyssey"" Circe and Kalypso - she ensnares Homer Wells though her seeming vulnerability whereas in fact she is taller and generally ""bigger"" than Homer WellsIn the book Homer Wells migrates back and forth between Cape Kenneth and St Clouds' but the film is far more dramatic in content that Homer only makes his journey there and back once It is a truly tragic and dramatic moment when Homer and Candy are sitting in the rain - Candy mourning for a paralysed Wally and Homer agonising over a pregnant Rose Rose and the knowledge he can help her and finally must do the think he hates most - abortion Does Dr Larch kill himself as Mr Rose certainly killed himself? Nurse Angela assures Homer that Larch's death was accidental but to me it seems more like suicide and fits in with a dual theme.Homer Wells' return to St. Cloud's is triumphant - and in my opinion - the great part of his return is the changed attitude of Mary Agnes and Homer's sudden interest in her A truly great movie - but I found the book one of the strangest I ever decided to stop reading about three quarters of the way though Sparkysmoonday",The Cider House Rules

Saw the movie for the first time after reading many other Irving books. It made me stick to the couch for as long as the movie lasted. Gives you a lot to think about. One abortion (Candy's) that surely will cause remorse later on as her boyfriend came back paralyzed from the war. The other one I don't think anybody would protest to, poor Rose, wonder what she made out of her life though. Of course it is a story that ends here but a very good story because it keeps you thinking about what happened to all the characters. Well, this is about it, and don't forget the beautiful scenery !",The Cider House Rules

310,angiegoff,Touching film with powerful messages - **spoiler warning,8,18 March 2018,"This film was based on the best-selling novel by John Irving. As with any film produced from a book, there are many details left out of the movie. However, I still found the film to be well written, portrayed, and edited. The film takes place in the 1940's, when abortion was still illegal. It is the coming of age story of a boy, Homer (Tobey Maguire) who grows up in an orphanage. He's been raised by the doctor who runs the orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Dr. Larch also trained Homer to deliver babies, and much to Homer's dismay, perform abortions - which Homer refused to do.Homer chooses to leave the orphanage and go out to see the world. He catches a ride with a beautiful patient, Candy (Charlize Theron) who visited the orphanage for an abortion and her boyfriend, Wally (Paul Rudd). They happily oblige and quickly befriend young Homer,Homer sees the ocean for the first time. He gets a job picking apples at an orchard, where he lives with his co-workers in the Cider House. He makes friends, he has a romance with Candy, and he learns about betrayal. He also learns how to accept responsibility for his actions away from the shelter of the orphanage, and he learns that there are some terrible people in the world. He willingly, performs his first abortion, to help someone in a bad situation and seems to understand a little about what Dr. Larch had been trying to tell him all those years before.The actual Cider House Rules are an ignored set of rules scribed on a piece of paper, insinuating that the residents are ignorant and lack common sense.The film touches on several taboo subjects, including, rape, incest, abortion, betrayal, murder, and drug abuse. Yet, it's still directed and written with an emphasis on people caring for each other. Overall, it's a bit sad but has happy moments as well. Even the ""bad guys"" are portrayed as having a good side.I highly recommend this film.",The Cider House Rules

What about love and compromise?

312,alexandrefallais,There is so much more to it !!,10,11 January 2006,"I found this movie not only well written, screen-played, played and edited, but I also found it had a true message of goodness in it, which goes beyond the nice story that you might want to dive into from time to time. It is definitely a very rich story. I think it is difficult to separate both notions presented by the movie: morality (is abortion a good or a bad thing, and from which point of view as both are present), and equality between Men, in terms of the racial issue. The movie takes place in the 40's, just before the US declared war to Japan. The work on how Afro-Americans should be treated had not yet really started, and they were still not very much considered as real ""equals"" to the whites. The ""rules"" which are part of the movie title in the first place, are imposed on the Afro-Americans who work in the Cider House, assuming they are stupid and unable to behave responsibly and with common sense. It is about the laws imposed on Men by other Men who do not necessarily understand the implications and the situations of those who have to comply with those rules. That leads naturally to the question of the Law : is the Law only a list of rules that we must obey without questioning at any time, or might it sometimes be a more blurry notion that sensible individuals might have to work out for themselves according to the circumstances? Or can we take into account that Life itself , and ""chance"", sometimes lead to another form of Justice, as it eventually happens at the end? To me, it is a real ""must see"". I would recommend parents to offer it to their teenagers as a means to let them build their own vision of the world.... Yes! it goes that far!!",The Cider House Rules
313,greengirl1482,I want my life back,1,20 November 2007,"It's been a little while since I've seen this movie, so bear with me. I had heard that it had a liberal slant, but I had assumed that, since it won the awards that it did, it would have at least merited those awards based on stylistic and artistic quality. However, after watching it I was convinced that it won the awards based on the message, not on the quality.The cinematography is mediocre, like something one would see in a Halmark made for TV movie. The music score was cheesy and melodramatic, although it fit the melodrama of many of the scenes in the movie. I also found that the acting was bland; all of the actors in the movie are top-notch, so I was surprised. But the directing and writing were so forced and awkward, even a great actor couldn't have performed well, I imagine.Moreover, I felt I was watching a propaganda film, for it essentially gave a list of things that the writers did and didn't agree with. A film with a message should give the facts to the viewer, and let them come to the conclusions (because a person is given the tools to come to the correct conclusion when the facts are presented; whether they take that opportunity is another matter). But this movie gave the conclusions, without the facts -- and did so quite rudely.I was also frustrated that no one seemed capable of taking responsibility for his actions. The two leads had an affair, but they acted as if it was inevitable, and not their fault. It also seemed that the ideals presented in this movie made it difficult to properly condemn the man who had molested his daughter without contradicting those ideals. His crime was dealt with far too gently as a result -- in my opinion, at least.In the end, I want these two hours of my life back.",The Cider House Rules

The cinematography is outstanding. The actors performed well, drawing viewers into their world. More than anything, this is a movie which makes a strong social statement enlisting empathy for social issues surrounding adoption, poverty, and abortion. This is a cleverly crafted work of art designed with an agenda to promote abortion because ""every child should be a wanted child"". The solutions offered in this movie suggest that one immoral act (such as incest or infidelity or sex outside of marriage) justifies another immoral act (such as abortion). I sympathize with the issues; I've experienced poverty and homelessness. The genius behind the book could have been more creative in dealing with these important social issues. Moral relativism and situation ethics have corrupted our culture. Too many people have bought into the Eugenics philosophy of Margaret Sanger.",The Cider House Rules
