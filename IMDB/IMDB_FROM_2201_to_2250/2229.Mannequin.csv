0,bkoganbing,I've never been kissed by a real live boy,7,27 May 2017,"Andrew McCarthy in this film got an opportunity to create and bring to life the girl of his dream. He's got an artist's temperament and has to express himself wherever he works. But sadly he works for employers who value speed and quantity so he can't hold a job. Working in a department store he fashions a Mannequin that is the girl of his dreams. And when he gives her a kiss, Kim Cattrall springs to life, but only for him. Saving the life of department store magnate Estelle Getty gets him a job at her store and he shows genius in creating truly great display windows. But he works at night and it's Cattrall who keeps inspiring McCarthy.Sad to say that there are any number of people who have differing agendas who are looking to put Getty's department store out of business, some of them working for her like James Spader, Carole Davis, Steve Vinovich and Christopher Maher.Part of Mannequin's appeal for me is this incredible cast of supporting players all of whom seem to be trying to top themselves with overacting. The best two are Meshach Taylor as the very flamboyant designer Hollywood who becomes McCarthy's best friend and G.W. Bailey the store security guard who if he wasn't ready for the rubber room trying to catch McCarthy doing something wrong will put him there. Seeing McCarthy in a compromising position with a store Mannequin makes him sure we can get him on a moral's clause.McCarthy and Cattrall through all this scenery chewing are a pair of appealing leads. Mannequin got one Oscar nomination for Best Song for the hit Nothing's Going To Stop Us Now.The film is 30 years old and it is still fresh and appealing as its leads. And very funny indeed.",Mannequin
1,SnoopyStyle,Ridiculous 80's cheese,5,18 September 2013,"Emmy (Kim Cattrall) was born in 2514BC Egypt. Her family wanted her to be married off to a camel dung dealer. She wished for a different life and the gods send her soul into a modern day mannequin. Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) can't hold onto a job. It takes him three days to make a mannequin. When he saves an old lady (Estelle Getty), it turns out that she's the owner of a failing department store. She gives Jonathan a job, and he's reunited with the magic mannequin that turns into Emmy when he's alone with him.This is cheesy 80's flic. It's got all the silly moments. James Spader is the ridiculously sleazy executive trying to torpedo the store. G.W. Bailey is the ridiculously stupid night watchman. Steve Vinovich is the ridiculously evil owner of the competition. And Meshach Taylor is the ridiculously over the top gay Hollywood. It's bad smelly cheese. But it's heart is in the right place. So I won't completely destroy this. Go ahead and just enjoy the smelly cheese.",Mannequin
2,mark.waltz,One touch of Emmy.,7,12 January 2021,"This is obviously inspired by the Kurt Weill musical which replaces the Greek Venus with an Egyptian princess. The film opens up with the very funny scene of Egyptian Kim Cattrall being nagged by her Brooklyn accepted mama (Phyllis Newman) to accept a marriage proposal which causes her to disappear and come back to life as a mannequin in Philadelphia where she is put together by the artistic Andrew McCarthy and later reunited with him at Estelle Getty's failing department store.The store's creepy boss (James Spader) wants to see the store bought out so he can get a good payoff but McCarthy and the mannequin who comes to life after the store closes help turn sales around with the help of the sweetly flamboyant window designer Meshach Taylor. Spader joins forces with the closeted but homophobic night guard G.W. Bailey to get something on McCarthy, giving this a nice twist on anti-gay bigotry and showing a nice friendship between a straight man and a gay man simply based on human decency.Then there's Carole Davis, the pretentious sometime girlfriend of McCarthy who wants to steal him for another store and pound the final nail into Getty's store. There's lots of interesting plot twists that makes this stronger than your average romantic comedy and there's a sweetness that makes this loveable in every way.Taylor's character may have a stereotypical manner but he's irresistible. Getty is nothing like her ""Golden Girls"" character although she is very sassy when she finally stands up to the nasty Spader who hysterically reminded me of ""How to Succeed in Business's"" Bud Frump. McCarthy and Cattrall are a delicious team, and their mystical romance is one of the best screen relationships of the 1980's.",Mannequin
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Funniest and Most Delightful Comedies of the 80's,7,29 September 2012,"In Edfu, in the ancient Egypt, the young Ema ""Emmy"" Hesire (Kim Cattrall) is a woman ahead of time. When her mother tries to force her to marry a manure dealer, she wishes to go to the future and vanishes. In the present days, in Pennsylvania, Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is an idealistic young artist that builds a mannequin. However, he is inefficient and can not keep his jobs and his ambitious girlfriend Roxie (Carole Davis) leaves him. But Jonathan sees his mannequin in the window of the Prince and Company Department Store. On the next morning, he saves the life of Ms. Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty), who owns the Prince & Co., and she asks the corrupt manager Richards (James Spader) to give the position in the stock to Jonathan. The Prince & Co. is near bankruptcy and the Illustra Company intends to but it, using Richards to sabotage the Department Store. Emmy comes back to life for Jonathan and they arrange wonderful windows. Jonathan is promoted to window dresser, working with the gay Hollywood Montrose (Meshach Taylor) that becomes his friend. Soon Jonathan becomes a successful designer, leveraging the Prince & Co and is promoted to VP. But Illustra's General Manager, Roxie and Richards want to force Jonathan to work for Illustra and kidnap Emmy.""Mannequin"" is one of my favorite films and I can not precisely tell how many times I have watched it. Andrew McCarthy was successful in the 80's and Kim Cattrall is one of the sexiest Hollywood actresses ever. The excellent James Spader is caricatural in the role of Richards and Meshach Taylor is hilarious in the role of a gay window dresser. The result is one of the funniest and most delightful comedies of the 80's. The soundtrack is also wonderful. Unfortunately the IMDb User rating does not mirror the truth about this wonderful and romantic fantasy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Manequim"" (""Mannequin"")",Mannequin
4,jboothmillard,Mannequin,4,19 February 2012,"When I found out that one of my favourite songs was featured in and came from this film, a film I probably never would have heard of before, and from the year I was born, I was interested to see what it would be like. Basically the film opens in Ancient Egypt with Ema 'Emmy' Hasure (Sex and the City's Kim Cattrall) hiding in a pyramid to get away from her mother (Phyllis Newman) who is forcing her to get married, so she prays to the gods to send her to her true love, and she disappears. Forward to present day Philadelphia, where Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is a young artist, who starts out with a job making mannequins, but when he is fired he can't seem to find a job that he can keep. He made his perfect mannequin that makes him feel happy, and he is really surprised to see it in the window of the Prince & Company department store, and he happens to save the life of the old Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty) who owns it, she rewards him with a job as stock boy. One night staying late in the store Jonathan has a conversation with what is normally an inanimate dummy, but the mannequin he made comes to life, possessing the soul of Emmy, and she knows that he is to be her true life, he just sees her as a new friend. The next day he wakes up to see a very artistic setup of mannequins posing in the store window, and everyone assumes it was him, so he is put in charge of designing more of them to bring in more business. At first Jonathan assumed he was hallucinating the dummy coming to life, but Emmy does come to life again, and he realises that she helped create the setups, so every night they make these, have fun, and get closer. While customers are fascinated by the artistic store windows setups and being drawn to the store, there are the people who are saying he is getting too close to his mannequin, including his supposed girlfriend Roxie (Carole Davis) and Richards (James Spader) who wants to fire him, but camp and eccentric Hollywood (Meshach Taylor) knows his dummy means a lot to him. There obviously comes the point when rival stores try to cash in on Jonathan's success with their own similar ideas, Jonathan is taken away from the store, and Emmy is taken to a plant to be destroyed, but love prevails when she comes to life during the day (instead of night like usual), and they get married to live happily ever after. Also starring Police Academy's G.W. Bailey as Felix, Steve Vinovich as B.J. Wert and Christopher Maher as Armand. I can agree slightly that McCarthy is a bit more plastic than the mannequin he is in love with, Cattrall is nice and sweet as the dummy that comes to life and falls in love with him, and I personally didn't think Taylor was that annoying as his highly camp, bizarrely dressed and exuberant friend, I thought he was pretty funny, it doesn't have many great jokes, but it is a nice sweet film, and the song at the end of the film is worth waiting for, an alright romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" by Starship (it was also nominated the Golden Globe). Okay!",Mannequin
5,moonspinner55,Nothing's gonna stop them now!,5,14 February 2009,"'80s cheese, done up in screwball style. Andrew McCarthy (grinning like a dimply pre-teen) gets a job with a department store dressing the display window; his ideas catch on with the easily-curious, and pretty soon business is booming, however his secret conceptual partner is actually a pretty female mannequin who only comes to life when the two are alone. James Spader (working hard to convince us he's a sniveling nerd) and G.W. Bailey attempt to expose the kid as a pervert in love with a wooden lady, while Meshach Taylor is a flamboyant confidante (what would have happened had he and McCarthy switched places?). As the magical model, Kim Cattrall is blithe and bemused, and one might almost accept the love story between she and Andrew if only he weren't so self-conscious and uncomfortable. The comedy is strictly low-ball, and the film never rises to the dizzy highs one ends up yearning for...but strictly as a time-filler, it isn't bad. Followed by a sequel in 1991. ** from ****",Mannequin
6,studioAT,Not great,2,7 November 2019,"Andrew McCarthy made a bunch of these types of films back in his 80's heyday, and this isn't one of the better ones.A very silly idea stretched to a feature run time...just about.The most notable thing is the soundtrack.",Mannequin
7,sunwarrior13,An 80's Cult Classic,6,7 September 2014,"Mannequin is a cult classic from the 1980's that stars Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall together with Estelle Getty and James Spader.It was a film that tries to revive the romantic comedies of the 1930's and 1940's.In the story,Jonathan Switcher is a department store window-dresser who discovers that one of his mannequins is a woman that was from ancient Egypt as she comes alive only to him and calls her Emmy.She inspires him to become the most expressive window-dresser that the department store has ever had.In the process,romance between them develops.In the end,Jonathan has to save her as the mannequin is going to be destroyed in an incinerator to prove his love for her.Despite of being predictable and clichéd as well as being illogical and has numerous plot holes,the film provided a lot of entertainment to many people during its theatrical release and it still continues to do at present as it has become a one of the most memorable films of the 80's.While the performances are forgettable,it did provide lots of entertainment to its target audience especially teen-age girls and viewers who love romantic comedies.Of course,the Academy Award nominated song by Starship,""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" has definitely become an imprint attached it.",Mannequin

9,hitchcockthelegend,Looking in your eyes I see a paradise.,5,15 June 2014,"Mannequin is either a sweet affectionate nostalgia movie – or an empty vacuous experience that fronts the bad side of 1980s American film making? Of all the teen comedies and brat packer pictures that flooded the decade, Mannequin appears to be the one that has no in between fan base, you either love it for what it is, or despise it and everything it stands for.So how do you review something like that? I mean if you have seen it already and are reading this, you don't need any guidance from me. Your minds are already made up, if you have not seen it and have any interest in the 1980s strand of such fare, then give it a go. It's hardly an abomination, while for fans of Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy it has to be worth a watch to see them try to cope with such under written lead characters.It's frothy and cheerful, but yes, devoid of substance, while one stereotype coupled with James Spader's worst performance hardly help matters these days. Soundtracking is decent enough, led by power pop ballad Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now sung by Starship, while the costuming is garishly period.Not to be taken seriously, obviously, and it has flaws galore, but it does have fans. Who knows, you may become one as well? Or you may want to stick sharp implements in your eyes instead? Roll the dice and take the chance. 5/10",Mannequin
10,Doylenf,Delightful screwball comedy from the '80s...,6,25 May 2008,"The low IMDb rating for MANNEQUIN is imbecilic. This is a thoroughly delightful mixture of madcap comedy and romance, played to the hilt by a sparkling cast of players who all have a gift for comedy.ANDREW McCARTHY is at his best as a young man drifting from job to job who ends up employed by ESTELLE GETTY at her almost defunct department store. It isn't until he gets real inspiration for window displays from a mannequin who becomes a real person whenever others aren't around, that the picture soars into romantic fantasy. KIM CATTRALL is the gorgeous dummy who comes to life and wins the heart of the hero who is at first reluctant to believe his own eyes.The sets and costumes are fantastic, the supporting cast is excellent and the script stays in high gear until the last twenty minutes when things get a little too hectic, even for a comedy/fantasy. But it's all in good fun, a cheerful flick easily enjoyable if you like fantasies of this kind and all of it is well photographed in pleasing color with splendid sets.ANDREW McCARTHY, KIM CATTRALL, JAMES SPADER (especially funny as a smarmy business man), and G.W. BAILEY (as the night detective) all demonstrate a flair for comedy in roles they obviously enjoyed playing.Well worth watching.",Mannequin
11,utgard14,Underrated Romantic Comedy,8,20 December 2013,"Frivolous, fun romantic comedy from the '80s. The basic plot is that a girl (Kim Cattrall) in Ancient Egypt is being forced into a marriage she doesn't want. So she prays to the gods and is magically transported/reincarnated/whatever to the future, where she becomes a mannequin that only comes to life for Andrew McCarthy.I know this movie is almost universally derided but I can't help but love it. It's a sweet, funny, innocently goofy movie that always puts a smile on my face. McCarthy and Cattrall are adorably likable leads. They're helped by a great supporting cast, including Estelle Getty and Meshach Taylor. Not to mention a soundtrack of great '80s songs. In a lot of ways, this movie reminds me of old comedies from the 1930s or 40s. It doesn't care if every little detail of the fantasy plot makes sense. It's just trying to show the audience a good time and, in my case at least, it accomplishes that.",Mannequin
12,view_and_review,Womannequin,2,26 August 2019,"The only good part of this movie was the closing song: Nothing's Gonna Stop Us by Starship.The movie begins in ancient Egypt. A very non-Egyptian looking woman named Emmy (Kim Cattrall) is so desperate to not marry a camel dung dealer that she ardently prays to God or the gods to deliver her from her situation. A stroke of lightning later and she's disappeared.Fast-forward some 3000 years and we pick up with Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy), the wannabe sculptor and incompetent man of many jobs. He lands a job at a department store called Prince and Co. There Emmy, now a mannequin, reveals herself to him and only him.Together they put up the most alluring window displays which pull Prince and Co. out of the financial abyss that it's been in. Because in '87 people really cared about window displays.The movie wouldn't have been so bad if it was at least funny. Minus the laughs and all the characters are just exhausting. It's not like the story was that creative to begin with so the pitiful characters just make the movie that much more unbearable.Switcher is a hopeless fool who is in love with a on again off again mannequin. It's not that far-fetched because guys will follow any pretty thing that give them the time of day, even if she's only real half the time.Emmy is this bubbly effervescent woman that offers nothing more than eye candy.Hollywood (Meshach Taylor) is a flaming homosexual that checked all the gay boxes.Richards (James Spader) is a weasley worm that talked like he was a silver spoon, northeast, Ivy League educated stiff.There were other pointless, clueless, or aimless characters too. I think Night at the Museum did a lot better job of bringing displays to life.",Mannequin
13,AlsExGal,Just have fun with it,7,7 June 2012,"This movie doesn't take itself seriously so why should we? Although Michael Gottlieb says it was based on an original idea, there are great similarities between this film and 1948's ""One Touch of Venus"". In both films a man with an artistic bent but a lack of self confidence is helped and loved by a mannequin/statue that only comes to life in his presence. This film is different in that protagonist Jonathan Switcher only brings the mannequin to life after a long string of job losses and then finally being dumped by his ambitious girlfriend, the obvious comparison being that the mannequin (Kim Cattrell) is more human than Jonathan's cold wooden girlfriend (Carole Davis).Probably released with a teen audience in mind - I was 29 when it came out - it really fits the bill if you are in the mood for good old low brow humor with lots of broad physical comedy and one liners. Kim Cattrell could never be Ava Gardner (the statue in the 1948 film) but she's got that ""I'll love you no matter what"" look down pat that would make any man feel like a king. James Spader has never looked like a more unlikeable little toad, and that is quite a feat when you know how handsome he is/was. Note that this thing is like a roll call of 80's sitcoms. There's Estelle Getty as the owner of the department store who played the eighty year old mom with a quick wit and smart mouth on ""The Golden Girls"". Here she plays basically the same character, only younger. Meshack Taylor was the comic foil for the ladies of ""Designing Women"", and G.W. Bailey played a serious role as a psychiatrist during the first season of ""Saint Elsewhere"" before taking on film roles where he largely played the buffoon. That is the case here where he plays the store security guard who for some reason is allowed to roam the store with a dog that is known to bite - I can only imagine what the store's insurance premiums are.Watch this movie for ""one touch of the 80's"" and, like I said at the beginning, just have fun with it.",Mannequin
14,anaconda-40658,Great Idea. Poor Payoff.,4,24 February 2016,"Mannequin (1987): Dir: Michael Gottlieb / Cast: Andrew McCarthy, Kim Cattrall, Estelle Getty, James Spader, G.W. Bailey: Corny romantic comedy that seems to reference the emotional side of love using the term mannequin as a symbol. Andrew McCarthy plays Jonathan Switcher who has a knack for creating art, including a mannequin he recently designed. Unfortunately he has been fired from every job out there. Kim Cattrall prays to the heavens to be vanquished of her Egyptian lifestyle of organized marriage. After an earthquake she is darted ahead to modern day where she inhabits the very mannequin Jonathan created. After landing a job in said store she comes to life, much to his shock but he is the only one who can see her. Preposterous, idiotic and written full formula straight through but one observes that director Michael Gottlieb had an idea. Cattrall is the spirited high full of gusto and enthusiasm. She helps Jonathan become a hit with window dressing thus threatening competition. Other characters cannot be believed. McCarthy is laboring under cardboard material. Estelle Getty as manager is flat. James Spader as Mr. Richards tries too hard. G.W. Bailey as security is an over the top version of his Police Academy role. Finally there is the cliché gay African American named Hollywood who competes with the rest of the fakery. Theme of emotional love barely comes alive in this store window freak show. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Mannequin
15,FlashCallahan,"I'm not making it up, I'm insane......",6,11 August 2014,"Jon is a young artist, but he just doesn't seem to last in any job he does. But when he builds a mannequin, he makes it so perfect, he falls in love with it. It is the first thing he has made that makes him feel like a real artist. The mannequin ends up in the window of a big department store. When he saves the life of the owner of that store, he is rewarded by getting a job at the store as stock boy. Later the mannequin comes to life, who was an ancient Egyptian known as Emmy. The two redesign the window display to make it most eye catching in town. But the store competitors are not happy and will do anything to stop them.......Yes the film is arguably one of the pinnacle movies associated with the eighties, but I guarantee that when you ask anyone about the movie, they will immediately quote the Starship song, and I dare you to remember a scene that wasn't in the music video.Its a case of great song, very average movie. I've seen the film at least six or seven times, and I had no idea that Spader was in it, and I am an eighties (proper) child. Born in the seventies, so I could appreciate the eighties, and not wear a tee saying 'born in the eighties'.But the two leads are great, and Cattrall is less plastic than she is in the abhorrent SATC. And Getty aside, the rest of the cast are just stereotypes. Spader is always the villain, and when he isn't, he's a pervert. Bailey has wandered in from Police Academy, and Taylor must play the most Un PC character ever committed to celluloid.It's not a bad film by any means, it's quite a sunny old ride, it's just a film about a man who is depressed about keeping a job and high maintenance girlfriend, so seeks solace with a shop dummy.When you think about it, it's the eighties version of Crash, which starred Spader too.",Mannequin
16,Aaron1375,"The film is not as lifeless as a mannequin, but it is not all that funny.",5,16 December 2011,"Saw this romantic comedy as a kid and it had some funny parts to it, mainly supplied by G.W. Bailey. The film is about some sort of Egyptian girl who comes back to modern times as a mannequin that only this one guy can see. She helps this guy get all famous and popular by doing window designs and that is about all there is to it. Basically a film where she can turn human in his presence and when someone else shows up she reverts back to a mannequin. So you know the drill, people begin to think the hero of the piece played by Andrew McCarthy (whatever happened to him?) is crazy and you have a jealous girlfriend and other things of that nature along with a stereotypical gay guy just to add some stereotypical laughs. There were laughs (not by the gay character), but to me G.W. was the funniest thing in the film playing a security guard who likes to have a super trained attack dog named after an 80's action film by his side. Kim Cattrall plays the mannequin and watching this film and Big Trouble in Little China you see her in her prime and she was a very lovely lady back then. In the end you have a film that did a rather good job at the box office as it cost a mere 6 million to make and it grossed 42, but it was a forgettable flick not really something that should be unburied and let's just hope it will never be remade.",Mannequin
17,Mr-Fusion,"Parts are good, but the screwball comedy is awful.",5,22 August 2015,"A flabbergasting thing, ""Mannequin"". Despite the overacting from pretty much everyone expect for Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy (Estelle Getty too, now that I think about it) and a majority of gags that just aren't funny, I found myself getting into this movie; if only just. the central love story is kinda sweet, and I found myself invested when they sent Cattrall off to the wood chipper. It's fluffy, pretty dumb and wholly superficial, but I dunno . . . the leads pull it off. There's just the matter of those supporting players.I do like the location they used for the department store, and the sets are like a hot dose of Madison Avenue '80s. The movie wasn't as entertaining as it was when HBO had it in heavy rotation 20-odd years ago, but certainly not the worst I've seen. Mostly, it's just goofy.5/10",Mannequin

19,JamesHitchcock,The Least Brattish of the Brat Pack,6,15 August 2013,"The last romantic comedy I reviewed for IMDb was the Steve Martin/Daryl Hannah vehicle ""Roxanne"", coincidentally also from 1987. That film has something else in common with this one. The term ""romantic comedy"" is often used to mean any boy-meets-girl love story with a happy ending, regardless of whether or not it is particularly humorous. ""Roxanne"" however, is a romantic comedy where the comedy is at least as important as the romance, and I think that the same holds good for ""Mannequin"". Admittedly, the style of humour is very different in the two films. ""Roxanne"", loosely based upon a classical French drama, is characterised by a much more intellectual, verbal humour, whereas in ""Mannequin"" the emphasis is much more upon slapstick and a very broad character-based humour. Yet both films never lose sight of the fact that the principal aim of a comedy is to amuse. According to Michael Gottlieb, the film's director and writer, he got the idea for the story when, walking down Fifth Avenue, he thought he saw a mannequin move in a department store window. It has, however, always struck me that part of the inspiration must have been ""One Touch of Venus"" from the late forties, another supernatural fantasy in which a young shop assistant falls in love with a statue which magically comes to life. The main character is Jonathan Switcher, an aspiring young artist, who finds it difficult to hold down a job until he finds work as a window dresser at Prince & Co., a large and long-established, but financially struggling, Philadelphia department store. While working there he falls in love with a beautiful blue-eyed blonde named Emma Hesire. There is, however, a catch. Emmy (as she is known) is originally from Ancient Egypt and has been transported to the Philadelphia of the 1980s by some capricious Egyptian gods. (I know that blonde hair, blue eyes, being called ""Emma"" and the ability to speak perfect English with a Canadian accent are not attributes normally associated with Ancient Egyptian womanhood, but as the above synopsis might suggest this is not a film which places a high premium on realism). There is a further catch. The same capricious gods have transformed Emmy into a mannequin. She can come to life for Jonathan as long as he is the only person who can see her. When anyone else is around she has to turn back into a mannequin. Emmy has one further attribute not normally associated with Ancient Egyptians or, for that matter, with mannequins. She has a genius for designing shop-window displays and gladly uses this skill to assist Jonathan in his work. The displays they produce together are so brilliant and attract so many customers that they radically improve the company's financial position, much to the disgust of the store manager, Mr Richards, who is secretly part of a conspiracy to run the company down so that a rival can acquire it at a rock-bottom price. The film narrates how Jonathan and Emmy are able to frustrate this conspiracy while at the same time coping with the difficulties in their romance caused by Emmy's turning back into a mannequin. Andrew McCarthy, like a number of his fellow ""Brat Packers"", was widely regarded as a rising star during the mid-eighties, although his career has been rather patchy since. The least brattish of the Brat Pack, he was often cast as good-looking, clean-cut romantic heroes, his Jonathan here being a good example. ""Mannequin"" is a rare example of a Hollywood older woman-younger man romance where the age difference is not turned into a major plot point or obstacle to the love of the two characters. Ignore the fact that Emmy is supposed to be about 4,500 years old; the glamorous, sophisticated thirty-something Kim Cattrall is clearly more mature by several years than the boyish twenty-something McCarthy. The film was successful at the box office, but the critics mostly disliked it. (Rita Kempley called it ""made by, for and about dummies."") I, however, have always had something of a soft spot for it. Certainly, it is based upon an absurd premise and many of the characters are one- dimensional caricatures. It certainly will not win many awards for political correctness, relying as it does on stereotypes like the outrageously camp and effeminate gay man and the arrogant, preening and sex-obsessed Frenchman. Many of those characters do, however, generate a lot of laughs, especially Meshach Taylor's flamboyant window dresser Hollywood Montrose, G. W. Bailey's paranoid and officious security chief Felix Maxwell, James Spader's smoothly hypocritical Richards and Carole Davis as Jonathan's bitchy and snobbish ex-girlfriend Roxie. (In 1987 Spader was a relatively unknown actor, not the big name he was to become after his performance in ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" a couple of years later). The film, in fact, is a lot better than ""One Touch of Venus"", a botched attempt to transfer a Broadway musical from stage to screen while excising a lot of the music which made it a hit on Broadway. The central idea may seem silly, yet it is no sillier than a lot of fairy-tales which have been a beloved part of European culture for centuries. A mannequin coming to life is no more absurd than the idea of a frog turning into a handsome prince or a princess falling asleep for a hundred years after pricking her finger. ""Mannequin"" is essentially a modern-dress fairy-tale which (unlike some other modern-dress fairy- tales such as ""Pretty Woman"") keeps the element of magic. Like all good fairy-tales it ends with virtue rewarded and vice punished and a wedding for the beautiful princess and her handsome prince. (It is, I think, no accident that Jonathan and Emmy work at a store called Prince & Co). The tale is told with enthusiasm and good-natured humour which makes the film enjoyable watching. Mention should also be made of Starship's catchy theme song ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"". 6/10",Mannequin
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, come on. It's a cute movie.",4,11 November 2003,"I was a little bit disappointed to see that this movie is a 4.8 on IMDb. After all it's not that bad. It's a funny story with a romantic plot. No, of course it isn't Oscar material, and it's not the ultimate comedy. But it's just a feel good movie that you'll enjoy if you're into cheesiness.Honestly, if you're telling me that you couldn't laugh at Captain Felix and his dog, Rambo, you must not have a funny bone. Especially for that funny scene where he and Mr. Richards end up in that car chase with Jonathan and Emmy, I mean come on, you had to laugh at that. There are also more than a few funny scenes that I thought more people would get a kick out of. Apparently, I was wrong, but please do give this movie a chance.

21,MovieAddict2016,I finally found it,6,11 November 2005,"I saw this movie years ago in England and it's been stuck in my mind ever since. I was a lot younger then and didn't really understand all of what was going on. I finally found the film again recently by doing a plot search and I have to say, it hasn't exactly held up.McCarthy is kind of a weak leading man. Kim Cattrall is pretty sexy as the mannequin-turned-woman but still isn't drop-dead gorgeous. Estelle Getty (who I also just saw in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot"") is given little to do but provides a bit of comic relief.The ending is a bit too over-the-top. It's a cute movie but not something I'd really want to watch very often or own - nostalgia is in fact preventing me from even giving it a lower rating than I am.",Mannequin
22,thesar-2,"Mann, That Was Sooo 80s",7,29 July 2016,"What a flashback to the Hollywood days of old. Where sexual harassment is accepted, homophobia sometimes okay and miracles with almost zero explanation can be dismissed in seconds.It's hard to criticize a movie like Mannequin. Sure, it's crazy, goof- ball and would never happen back then or now, but it was a light- hearted, fantasy of love acrossthe ages? At least it wasn't as dark as other mannequin stories like I Know Who Killed Me and 2012's Maniac. Basically, the ALWAYS lovely Kim Cattrall wishes for something more in Ancient Egypt and the gods fast forward her a few times over the millennia to finally land with Andrew ""Jonathan"" McCarthy. Only, she's trapped in a mannequin's form so no one but Jonathan can see her. Oh, and he falls in love with her and because others see her as a stiff, pure antics ensue.It's cute, it's harmless – well, except for said un-PC themes mentioned above and best of all, it gave the world one of the best movie songs of all time: 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now' by Starship.Sorry, lest I forget, it also provided the outrageously fabulous Hollywood character in which Jonathan was the straight man of the duo. Um, no pun? Definitely worth a watch if you loved it back then or for the first time today. It still holds up, if you just remember one simple rule: this was made in and is 100% pure 80s. ***Final thoughts: I mentioned homophobia above, and some of the characters are, though one might be closeted, himself. But, it was refreshing to see how Jonathan and Meshach ""Hollywood"" Taylor took to each other very nicely. Plus, Jonathan, who barely knew Hollywood early on and most certainly not as good friends with him until later, completely defends gays while making a statement against bigots. That was nice to see a stand in a 80s movie that could've very well taken the stance: ""Well, that's just the world we live in.""Additionally, I wonder if True Blood's Nelsan Ellis got even a little bit of inspiration for his Lafayette Reynolds character from Hollywood. Hmmm",Mannequin
23,gridoon,"Stupid and unfunny, but Cattrall almost makes it worth watching.",5,12 June 2003,"As a comedy, ""Mannequin"" is completely lacking in wit. Its idea of humor is having a gay character drive a pink car with license plates that read ""Bad Girl"". All its secondary characters and physical gags are painfully stupid and unfunny. But as a fairy tale and a romance it fares better. As a fairy tale, because it has an initial idea that is easy to relate to (everyone has, at one point or another, looked at a doll that seemed strangely lifelike), and as a romance, because Andrew McCarthy is a likable enough hero, and Kim Cattrall brings a combination of innocence and unmistakable sensuousness to her part; you'd never guess that she is actually six years older than McCarthy!

24,Lejink,Showroom dummies,2,21 December 2014,"I think to like this film you really have to be an apologist for the decade that taste forgot, the 80's. I actually wanted to like this film, I mean I love fantasy films but when I'm pushed to offer the most obvious insult about it, that the actual mannequins in the department store act better than any of the humans, then I guess I'm in a pretty bad way. Might I have thought differently if I was 13 years old at the time of the original release...well no, I hope not.This really is just an awful rom-com feature, trying, I don't know, to capitalise on the success of other films where ordinary guy meets other-worldly girl and finds true love after a series of madcap adventures...""Splash"" anyone?I also have to say it, there is something weird about watching Andrew McCarthy's character smooch a blow-up doll and carry it around with him everywhere. His romance with Kim Cattrell's Roxie character, who conveniently time-travels to mid-80's Philadelphia from ancient Egypt and helps him in his job as a window-designer at a big store, takes in various attempts at slapstick, particularly with an over-zealous store detective, his dog and the conniving store executive he reports to.The comedy is non-comedic, the story is paper-thin, the characters even less so. I don't know who I hated most, besides those already mentioned, but there's also the camp black stylist McCarthy pals up with, the big bad department store-owner rival who takes his girl and the little-old-lady heart-of-gold shop owner who takes his part.With an inane soundtrack, forced situations and awful dialogue, I watched this film to the end, just to get to the end. Sorry I just thought it was terrible and nothing's gonna stop that thought.",Mannequin

There are many elements screwball comedy, slapstick, physical comedy, as well as sly wit with intelligent humor and classic comedic performances and acting.

26,tomgillespie2002,Sheer drivel,2,23 March 2013,"If I were ever to be truly embarrassed about any of my entries into the Childhood Memories Project, it would be this simply disastrous excuse of a movie. It was shown mid-afternoon in the early days of Channel 5 one day, and my granddad thought to record it for me, along with another bizarre and semi-obscure entry into the 1980's comedy genre, FEDS (1988). I can't remember if I even liked the film, but I remember watching it repeatedly. Maybe I was drawn to the simple-minded and childish comedy, played out over some extremely dodgy 80's electro-pop. Or perhaps it was Kim Cattrall, looking beautiful before she starred as upper-class slut Samantha in Sex in the City (1998-2004), stirring some pre-pubescent feelings inside of me. I like to think the latter is true.Ancient Egyptian princess Emmy (Cattrall) hides from her mother who wants her to marry against her will. After praying to the Gods for rescue, she in transported through time on a quest for true love. Meanwhile, young mannequin-manufacturer Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is sacked for taking too long on the job, he drifts between jobs while trying to keep his demanding girlfriend Roxie (Carole Davis) happy. One night he spots his greatest mannequin creation - in the image of Emmy - in the window of the failing Prince & Company, ran by Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty) and the slimy Richards (James Spader). After saving Claire from a bizarre accident, he is given a job as a stock boy. One night, Emmy comes to life and enchants Jonathan, inspiring him to create a window display that attracts a large audience.I don't really know how to write a serious review of Mannequin after just typing that plot synopsis. The bull-s**t story and lack of any remote explanation aside, the film is nothing but clichéd, childish humour, and a fairytale romance aimed at mentally numb teenage girls. The truly creepy idea that Jonathan is in love with a plastic mannequin is simply justified by his outlandish co-worker Hollywood (Meshach Taylor) being 'weirder'. He is gay and camp, after all! There is also a gaping plot-hole that begs that question as to why Jonathan doesn't just take the mannequin home with him, therefore ruling out the need to sneak around under the nose of psychopathic security man Felix (G.W. Bailey) and his dog Rambo. It would have also been a reason to avoid 90 minutes (and hours of my childhood!) of sheer drivel.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Mannequin
27,insomniac_rod,THE perfect romantic comedy of the 80's. See below why...,8,30 September 2006,"The plot is cute, filled with pure fantasy. Come on! who wouldn't want to fall in love with a hot mannequin that comes to life? Andrew McCarthy who is widely known for starring in these kind of movies, and Kim Catrall deliver great performances. The chemistry between them is 100% natural. With such a great plot and a likable lead couple, the movie needs funny/smart situations that should fit with the fantasy atmosphere. ""Mannequin"" delivers many tender and entertaining situations enough to please the viewer (especially those who are into romantic comedies). Yes, there's also the cheese factor but it's easy to ignore, trust me; it won't be a problem.The resolution of the movie and the ending are also great. This is not the typical movie that will make your girlfriend cry, but it will surely move her in a positive way. In fact, some scenes are sexy and arousing so there you go, this is a complete romantic feature from the crazy 80's. If it wasn't enough, the main song of the movie is ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"". A classic in these days and one of the most catchy songs of all time. It has a great vibe and always manages to make me feel good.""Mannequin"" captures perfectly the essence of the 80's in all the sense of the word. It's a colorful, entertaining, cute movie.It's more than a guilty pleasure. The woman who played Roxie was gorgeous!",Mannequin

29,lisafordeay,A cute romantic film that you shouldn't be taken too seriously,6,26 February 2015,"I remember this movie a long time ago so here is my review on it.The story is about a young man named Jonathan (played by Andrew McCartney)who works in a department store in New York City as a mannequin maker. He of course is in love with a girl,but the problem is she isn't real,she's a mannequin that he created (you can clearly see this in the beginning of the film). But when no one is around,the mannequin is magically brought to life named Emme (played by a very young Kim Catrell). You see she was cursed a very long time ago in Egypt( as she is of course a mummy) and she ends up being transformed into a mannequin and is sent to modern times(you will see this of course in the beginning of the movie) to find love. So will Emme and Jonathan ever get together and can she become human in the end of the movie?Bottom line this is a very contrived movie with a very contrived plot,but if you love a bit of fun and you want to watch a feel good 80s chick flick,then check it out. I enjoyed it as I have seen this film so many times before on TV.6.1/10Also keep an eye out for a hilarious stylist with cool looking sunglasses named Hollywood(who is also in the sequel)and Estelle Getty who was in The Golden Girls.",Mannequin

Jonathan Switzer(Andrew McCarthy) is a very talented artist who seems to have a tough time keeping a job. However, his luck is just made when the mannequin he builds in his earlier job, comes to live whenever he's alone. The mannequin named Emmy(Kim Cattrall) who's desire for Jonathan is insatiable. Jonathan's friend Hollywood(Meshach Taylor, ""Designing Women"") wonders about him while he should worry about his own problems. I liked the small video Jonathan and Emmy made together wearing different outfits while ""Do you Dream about Me?"" was being played. I liked the flash scene. Then there's the scene between Felix(G.W. Bailey) and Switzer got into the brawl when he thinks Switzer is doing a ""dummy"". When Switzer rescue Emmy from the shredder, the curse was broken. And everyone got to see her including the bad guys. Hollywood needed a serious realty check, however Felix needs it way more.

Yippie let the good times roll. 80's victim Andrew McCartney co-stars as a schmo who discovers the secret about this wax sex doll. More mumbo-jumbo than you can shake a stick at. 1987 was a big year for bad 80's movies and this was one of them. Kim Cattral is easy on the eyes (which is good) the acting and the story (which is bad) drags this movie down, down, down.Life is too short to waste 90 minutes of your time.Not recommended.

The story didn't involve you, it's quite the fun concept, but as a fantasy type of love story movie it wound up being more boring then funny. The opposite of another 80's fantasy movie-""splash""-man falls in love with mermaid-in THAT case, there was so much chemistry between hanks and Hanna and the film was such a delight in general. This was almost the opposite in every respect, everything from the humor to the pace of it all, fell short and did nothing for me.

I gave it a rewatch as an adult not long ago, and the magic I seemed to remember from when I was young had barely survived.The falling in love scenes where the two characters are alone were still sort of cute... but with age I could see that any development was paper- thin (unlike Splash, for example... which has a silly concept, but still takes quite a serious look at the emotional predicament of its two characters). Also, much as I love G.W. Bailey, the slapstick scenes of him running around the department store with his dog(s) wore on my nerves, after awhile...

Mannequin deserves to be her best because she is so much more lively and vivacious than in any thing else she has ever done. Wasted in her role on ""Sex with the City"" or whatever it is called, she plays an immortal siren who lives on in the works and creations of other artists which she then inspires like some Olympian Muse, but instead of Greek Gods she is under the magic of the Egyptian gods. Andrew McCarthy of ""Bernie's"" fame is her paramour as he plays a down and out sculptor looking for some magic. Estelle Getty is a lovely and strong-willed presence herself when she's not playing an old woman, and G. W. Bailey is the comic relief as he plays a gungho security guard with dogs named after other  action movies. Meshach Taylor misguidedly plays a gay stereotype as if it were the only way he could get the role. all in all, this is a very charming and light-hearted romantic comedy.

At first, it was going to be fine as a modern-age romance with the magical bliss, until a hefty load of dull and idiotic gags greatly ruined what must have been a very likeable movie. With G.W. Bailey in another policeman's uniform (well, he's a security guard this time!), this is yet another POLICE ACADEMY semi-sequel.

38,jhaggardjr,Delightfully silly romantic comedy-fantasy,8,17 June 2000,"""Mannequin"" is a silly movie to be sure. But I found it to be very funny at times. I was just a teenager when I first saw this movie back when it came out in 1987. My mom took me and a friend to see this, and we all laughed and had a good time. It's no classic, but so what. All that matters is that it's a fun movie, and that's exactly what this is. Andrew McCarthy stars as a man who's had bad luck with working jobs. His main interest is to be a sculptor. At one of his jobs he made mannequins, and for some odd reason he seems to fall in love with the last mannequin he made. Later he gets employed at a department store that has taken that mannequin in. And before you know it, the mannequin comes to life in the form of an Egyptian princess. But she only comes to life when the two are alone together. When someone else comes into the scene, she freezes up and turns into a mannequin again. This may sound like a stupid premise, but I don't care. ""Mannequin"" is a movie that's very entertaining. It's not a laugh riot, but I did laugh quite a bit throughout. Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall (as the mannequin) look as if they're having a blast, and if I was the McCarthy character, I would have a blast too. The supporting cast includes Estelle Getty (from TV's ""The Golden Girls"") as Mrs. Timkin, the friendly owner of the store; James Spader (in an early film role) as the smarmy manager of the store; G.W. Bailey (from the ""Police Academy"" films) as the bumbling midnight security guard of the store (who spends most of his time talking to his dog); Meshach Taylor (from TV's ""Designing Women"") as McCarthy's assistant (who acts strange most of the time); and Carole Davis as McCarthy's former girlfriend (who works at a rival department store nearby).

For that reason, i love much films with this characteristics, just like Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth"" or ""The Muppets take Manhattan"". Just like Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" or his masterpiece ""Big Fish"". And then we find something like ""Mannequin"".Before ""Mannequin"", i have read a lot of critics. All of it was bad opinions. Much of that opinions, in certain way, try to cursing it or burn it like it was the most horrible and awful movie in history. I have not any idea of ""Mannequin"". I think that, if was so bad... why see something like that? One day i watch at my T.V an interesting movie about a guy who loves be an artist in his way. That movie was ""Mannequin""... and let me tell you something: I LOVED IT!!! The story of ""Mannequin"" told us about Jonathan, an artist. He is not exactly a writer, a painter, a sculptor, a musician or a filmmaker. He designs and build mannequins. But he not finds his job as any other, he loves his own work. Jonathan doesn't care to take a long time in their work as long as he makes a true beautiful mannequin. But his boss cares nothing about this. Exactly, after Jonathan's masterpiece is finished, he is fired. He try to finds a decent job but he ends in the street Whit his motorcycle. A rainy night, Jonathan find his mannequin again.

Someone who he thinks that was on wood. He was so wrong! ""Mannequin"" has a great story that i don't want to ruin. The characters are so sticky, and who cares if are similar to other films of the same genre, this movie are maybe more creative than others. The characters has been performed by great actors like Andrew McCarthy (One of the most handsome guys that i have ever seen in movies), Kim Cattrall (Beautiful in her role as our beloved mannequin), Meshach Taylor (Funny in his role of ""Hollywood"") Estelle Getty, James Spader, Carole Davis (As evil Roxie) and G.W Bailey (With his dog ""Rambo"").Much of who has live in the 80s going to love ""Mannequin""... anyway, i don't even live in the 80s!!!

45,richspenc,Good comical 80s movie,8,5 February 2016,"I don't understand Roger Ebert's review of this film, calling this film dead. This film is anything but dead. Its got actually a fairly unique comical idea to it, a maniquinn coming to life to help give an insecure man confidence. The idea's not totally new, but there have been much more boring films than this. Sure, the film isn't perfect, but there are some pretty amusing moments.Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is a young twenty something who has had continuous bad luck keeping a job, due to his creative side overtaking the practical sides of his jobs that his bosses expect from him. That problem continues to annoy his bosses and gets him fired again and again, and we get to see a colorful montage of this. His girlfriend Roxy (Karen Black, a hot sexy half Italian / half east coast woman who also had an incredibly sexy moment topless on a boat in ""Pirrahnas 2"") has trouble understanding him too to where she wonders if staying with him is a good idea. Jonathan is an artist type who a lot of people view as someone with his head in the clouds and is not a hard nosed practical type of person.Through a (humorous) by chance situation, Jonathan runs into the elderly owner (Estel Getty) of a department store right outside the store. He saves her from getting injured from a falling sign, she then takes an instant liking to him. Jon asks for a job at the store, she immediately obliges. She introduces Jon to Richards, the store manager, who takes an instant disliking to him. Then Jon meets Felix, the night watchman, who also right away dislikes him. Felix is played by Richard Harris from the ""Police Academy"" films, and plays the same type of character here, a short tempered but dim witted cop. Jon also meets Hollywood, a very flamboyant man who I found annoying, but who liked Jon. Then, the fantasy part of the film occurs. A manniquin in one of the store windows, the same manniquin that Jon assembled at one of his other jobs, comes to life. She is played by Kim Catrell and plays the manniquin as a very nice and sensual woman who really takes a liking to Jon. Kim was pretty sexy here first in a scene where she started taking off her shirt, and then in several displays during the song ""Do you dream about me"". I know that song was very much like a late 80s Mtv music video, but I really liked it and it had a great beat. Kim was also pretty sexy in ""Sex and the city"" in the late 90s. Anyway, Kim helps Jon put together very spectacular window displays and that helps get Estel, the store owner's attention even more positively focused on Jon. Of course, no one but Jon can see the manniquin come to life, causing some people to start thinking he's a little Looney. But to Estel, it doesn't matter because Jon has now greatly helped the store's business, and that's what she cares about. But Jon does lose his girlfriend Roxy and makes other people including Richards and Felix really now hate him. Anyway, I'm not gonna say any more about the film here. Just watch it and enjoy.",Mannequin

Technology was developing but it was not overbearing and everywhere like it is now. Mannequin was a transition movie, coming out of the materialistic Big Eighties into the early '90s era of increasing acceptance of alternative lifestyles.The movie is a lot more progressive than people give it credit for. The artistic main male character was positively juxtaposed against other characters that defined manhood in a negative way (the hyperaggressive security guard and the corporate schmooze). This sends a powerful message that the definition of being a ""man"" isn't always about being a jerk. Yes, you can find a girlfriend and succeed at life without reducing yourself to being a cog in the machine or macho posturing.I'm giving this movie 10 stars because it deserves a higher rating than it's getting now. Otherwise I'd give it an 8. The movie itself was well made and well directed. The experience of watching this is fun. For those of us old enough to remember when it came out, it is also nostalgic.",Mannequin
48,Growlyted,"Sweet, quirky romance. (Includes excellent dance number.)",8,8 March 2006,"This sweet, unassuming film, is always a delight to view. It's daft, yet fun. A hapless, wanna-be sculptor, is surprised when his favourite mannequin turns into a live woman, only for him. The back story leads into a quirky animated title sequence, accompanied by the first of many excellent songs - In My Wildest Dreams. However the definite highlight of this movie is the dance routine in the store with elaborate costume changes. (Do You Dream about Me?) The supporting characters are OTT, especially Hollywood, a gay window dresser. There aren't many IQ points for either good guys or villains, but then it's not a high brow affair. It's slapstick & romance and great tunes. The feel good finale leads into Nothing's Gonna Stop Us. What more could you ask?",Mannequin
49,Thornfield2,A Dummy movie with heart,7,1 June 2001,"This movie is pure cheese yet I can't help but say that I like it.Some parts are hammed up but the little romance between the lonely, artsy stock boy and the glamorous, ancient-Egyptian Barbie doll is cute. Felix, the night watchman is hilarious and the zaney Hollywood character steals the show. Cute little movie to lift your spirits.",Mannequin
50,m-ozfirat,Enjoyable 1980's fun,8,11 March 2018,"The film is aptly named Mannequin and is great escapism and enjoyable entertainment. The films of the era tended to be down to earth, inventive
and charismatic which in my view would make this a classic. The film starts of with an intelligent Ancient Egyptian Duchess giving the film
an exotic feel though we do not see her in indigenous dress who is being forced to marry someone she does not want to and so wished to go to another time thats compatible for her. 
She eventually ends up in Philadelphia, America were she meets a handsome but unlucky and frustrated artist Jonathan who has an attachment to a Mannequin he has made inside a department store. His luck takes a turn for the best when he is hired grows closer to his work and when the Duchess comes to life in the form of the mannequin things take an auspicious and adventures path with the Duchess taking full Human form and then marrying Jonathan. The Music is good through out the film from the enjoyable animated introduction to the end credits, the chemistry between the characters works and the storyline is relevant and basic but made interesting with the other characters in the film with the atmosphere of tension and support. Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy are well paired and suited to each other in the film and the co-stars play their parts well with a dynamic performance. 
Prior to her Sex and the City days Kim did some very good films with her natural hair colour Brown making her more elegant that her earlier and sincere works have been half forgotten hopefully this and others will stand the test off time as this was a big part of my youth.",Mannequin

I feel a lot of people have missed the point with this 80s classic, romance comedy. I absolutely love Kim Cattrall, she's absolutely gorgeous in the film, I admit I had a crush on her when I first saw it. Andrew McCarthy is also excellent in the role, very funny and likable. But the highlight of the movie is the musical score for me, I can't get enough of it, huge props to Sylvester Levay. It gets better with multiple viewings, I've seen it a lot and it never gets old for me. Fantastic and forgotten 80's gem. 10/10.",Mannequin
52,spenrh,"Amusing at times, dumb at times",6,8 February 2020,"I enjoyed this movie when I was younger back in the late 1980s when it came out in the theaters, and then first came out on video and on HBO. But having gotten a little bit older, I notice how dumb some of the characters in this movie are. Like for instance at a department store board meeting when discussing how bad business has been and how few customers they've had, and then them discussing the new fabulous window displays that new hiree Johnathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) has put up, they then say ""you know something..if more people come to see the window displays, then they may stay to buy!!"" Like really, these educated corporate executives suddenly discover that simple basic idea of business? That's the general all-around rule of advertising, make commercials look appealing to get people's attention of the product.There are numerous other characters in this film who you'd wonder ever exceeded 9th grade let alone be a college grad. I couldn't help laughing at one point a man calling the hero ""biscuit brain"" (in Looney tunes style) when he gave his son a large helium filled balloon that floated him up to the sky, and he tells him to let go of his son's legs, when he's in fact holding on to them to stop him from floating off with the balloon. No, I'm not making this up. And the surly but dimwitted Police Academy GW Bailey stars here as department store night watchman replaying his character from the Police Academy movies. Many of the characters in this movie act and talk quite juvenile.Johnathan Switcher plays a free flowing artistic type who doesn't know how to separate those free flowing ways from the straight forward practical jobs he keeps getting and immediately getting fired from. And we get a fairly amusing montage of a string of those brief jobs and firings (he thinks that even working at a pizzeria, he should take his time placing the pizza toppings on in a slow creative decorative way).He has a girlfriend (Karen Black) who's gotten tired of his lack of responsibility and inability to live in the real world, who also works at a rival department store from the store Switcher gets a job at (and the first job he doesn't get immediately fired from and has a manager who actually likes him (Estelle Getty)). The other members of the store (smarmy executive James Spader and watchman GW Bailey) don't like him at all, which is nothing new to him in his life though.Then comes the main plot with the mannequin, who Switcher put together in one of his earlier failed jobs, who has now come to life. She's helped him decorate these fabulous window displays, and spends time with him trying to get all frisky (an early version of Kim Cantrell's seductive behavior which is seen many more times in late 1990's ""Sex and the city"").We, of course, then get the other characters of the movie thinking Switcher is crazy, because Cantrell's manniquin can come to life when only Switcher sees her. That also includes Hollywood, a painfully stereotypical homosexual appearing in this movie during a time when many people still openly did not accept homosexuality yet (GW Bailey calling him a ""Mary"" was probably far from the only one who called gays that back in the 1980s and got away with it).So anyway, even though this movie is kind of fun in some ways, it's far from being my favorite. I give it a 6.",Mannequin
53,Tracy_Terry_Moore,Cute movie :),7,28 July 2009,"Andy McCarthy's appeal is a positive counter to Kim Cattrall's marginal but hot-bodied performance in this contemporary Pygmalion romantic-comedy about an Egyptian princess who attracts the attention of a modern-day window dresser.Solid co-starring appearances by Meshach Taylor, Estelle Getty, and G.W. Bailey add to the light-heartedly fun atmosphere as McCarthy tries to secure his 'dummy' both physically and romantically all the while being chased by department store big shots and his own sanity.Good Friday night rental and one of those movies that is endearing enough to go out and buy for a personal collection.",Mannequin
54,xenazues,Maybe it was just Kim Catrall,7,22 January 2017,"I grew up loving this movie to be honest with you. I was born in '77 so I would would have been around 10 actually closer to 9 considering my birthday was late in the year. And I didn't really realize how much I liked Kim catrall till I got older. My memory of movie stars wasn't as great at 10 like it is now at 40. I didn't even realize it was here until after sex and the city was almost over and reviewed the movie again recently. I have it Blu ray and I'm looked to find mannequin two which Kristy Swanson is hot as well too.But Kim might have just made this movie what it was. I showed this to my roommate who is 27 so this is before she was born. She has never seen it and all she talks about is the the guys girlfriend and what she is wearing and her hair. I must say that's my favorite part about watching these older movies. Yes 1987 to 1993 had their own look. And shoulder pads for women and their huge hair spray hair (which I'm not sure if she had) was in. Even how they wore their hair was really unusual compared to before an now. The 70's girls hair was model looking and a lot of people wish they could get their hair like Lynda carter or the charlies angels. The whole Melanie g working girl is out.And the plot is honestly horrendous now that I look at it. Great idea but you didn't really sell me on it. The police officer who plays a police officer in every movie was just out of place. He made sense in short circuit, and made sense in police academy but here he was out of place. Then again all mall cops are out of place to be honest. But a mannequin from the past that comes to real life. Interesting but sell me on it do. And the guy black guy in place with mannequins. Not buying that either. Probably what he is most remembered for and technically he was a better actor than that. I saw him in an episode of the heat of the night. Good actor died way too young. Mannequin two was funnier. But you are still stuck in that '87 to '93 time line so keep in mind the attire. Its not exactly top of the line.But Kim's part she was hot. And just like in porky's where you had to put a jock strap in her mouth when she had sex. Heck she turned into a mannequin just to avoid people. She also made you feel like you just wanted to do something fun. A beautiful girl makes you do crazy things...Now that's an original idea...hmm think not. Probably the easiest casting that director did. Her acting was great, her looks great and she gave it a feel to it that the show needed or it would have died. Plus just like your typical 80's, a great movie song. I love the ""Nothing going to stop us now"" Still play it at bars when I go out. Its a classic. So should you see this movie, yes you should. If anything its great to talk about and Kim's part alone was good enough. Not to insult the other actors, but the director should have including some room for other actors to be themselves. The main character was flat too and so was his girlfriend.",Mannequin
55,minerals,This movie is a great love story,10,22 September 2004,"I liked this movie ever since I first watched it because it shows at first a young lady who is in Egypt that does not like who her mother is trying to force her to get married to and then she gets sent forward in time to the City of Philadelphia. Then when it shows Andrew McCarthy putting that mannequin together then going through all those other jobs until he gets the one at that store for saving the lady that Estelle Getty plays when that ""100th aneversary"" sign comes loose and he rejoins that Mannequin. It is understood why he loves the Mannequin because all artists fall in love with their creations. Then the movie gets really adventuresome when she starts coming to life and they start going all over that store doing things. I really got a laugh out of the dog that G.W.Bailey had because it was named Rambo! I also really liked how the ending of the movie was showing a wedding scene and I really liked how that movie is because I watch it at least 3 times in a month. I was glad when they released it on DVD.",Mannequin

57,alphaspace,"He Was No Johnny Depp & She Was No Dummy, But HE WAS HOLLYWOOD!",10,31 January 2004,"This is Another Case Where the Black Actor Stole the Movie.  Mannequin started out as another boring little movie about man finds girl.  Ok man finds Mannequin has special real time relationship with her only when they are alone.  Man ultimately gets girl.  Ok it was really nice.  The old Egyptian mummy thing was a great start to the movie was a way nice touch too, ""Kufu Egypt just after lunch"" a hoot that was for sure.Anyway a gentleman named ""Hollywood"" the gay black male friend and fellow window dresser at the store where most these adventures happen stole this movie.  Hollywood's scenes while stereotypically gay in the worse ways were none-the-less totally funny laugh fests.  Hollywood is just a happy go lucky campy queen and part tyme Diva without DIVA-Tude whose sly prose support and comedic timing make this movie.  Hollywood adds the spice the intrique and comedic shot in the arm this movie needed to be if not real then at LEAST Real Funny.  In this movie I must pronounce Hollywood the last true Diva.Hollywood was a great friend and a fun person with a heart of gold.  The actress that played the Mannequin was a stunning beauty as well.  I could see why any man would have loved the Mannequin as she was always a nice caring warm wonderful friend in here animated moments.  By the time the movie was ending you totally wanted both Mannequin and husband to live happily ever after, <knock on wood!> Patented Evil-Wolf-Grin.  Our Gay Diva Hollywood's greatest scene in the movie comes near the end of the movie as well when you see his car... and most notabily the car cover they are collectively a scream.The movie is filled with all the expected weird wild crazy crackpot straight laced bisuness men, odd characters, pathetic boob detectives, animals and such to be most excellent filler.  The movie has a simple plot that you won't need to have explained here as it is far from rocket science.  All the characters in the movie do a good job in adding demension to the movie.  Is this movie an Oscar calliber production definately NO WAY!.  This movie is just a nice movie you can safely let your brain curl itself up around on a day when you do not plan to do much thinking and you just want to relax not be surprised laugh a little and eat bon bons, pop corn and the odd slice of pizza fresh or stale.",Mannequin
58,amandagellar-31077,Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,7,5 January 2020,"Mannequin never pretends to be anything more than what it is - lightweight fun. Nothing in here is to be taken seriously, especially when, in the first 15 minutes, the lead character is airbound by a department store sign like a seesaw for an entire scene and keeps getting zapped by the exposed wires used to light it up. It's silly through and through, but it's never less than 100% entertaining.Andrew McCarthy stars as Jonathan - a hapless creative trapped in uncreative jobs that don't appreciate his attention to detail and artistic spark. When he gets a job at a failing department store, he meets someone who changes everything for him - a mannequin named Emmy (Kim Catrall) who comes alive when they're alone and helps him design the city's best department store window displays. These displays get him a lot of attention, but also puts him at risk of being manipulated by a rival department store.McCarthy and Catrall commit to the silly story with an admirable amount of gusto and Meshach Taylor adds a good deal of comic relief as McCarthy's flamboyant co-worker and James Spader is appropriately slimy (and almost unrecognizable) as McCarthy's wicked boss.If you just want to turn off your brain and have a little fun, Mannequin might quench your thirst for cheesy 80's fun.",Mannequin

Both movies got 1 star and were hated by the critics but we all loved them back then and still love them right now. The dance scene (Dream about me) was fantastic. Kim Cattrall is so absolutely fantastically beautiful. I could live forever with a girl smiling at me who looks like her. The background music is on key and correct, and easy to listen to. An early James Spader (Mr. Richards) does a great job as a baddie. G.W. Bailey is his usual corny funny self and is very nicely accompanied by his dog, Rambo. They actually use the dog almost as good as the one in Men in Black.This movie is a MUST SEE. As many writers in this column have said, this does have a ""feel good"" ending. I don't think Roxie is THAT good looking. She's nice looking. Actually, she looks like the gal in the sitcom called King of Queens. I wonder if there is any relation. Roxie's foreign boyfriend is actually quite funny.As unrealistic as this movie might seem, I think both men and women have had a fantasy of this kind. This is a movie all viewers can relate to.

64,tonellinon,Pygmalion of the 80's,7,13 July 2016,"I liked it. It's not cinema history. It's a fairy tale, complete with all the character types of that genre. The soundtrack makes me nostalgic for a time when I was young and dated dumb--well, no--I was the dummy back then (now, too, come to think of it).The supporting cast did very well with very mediocre writing. Estelle Getty, James Spader, G.W. Bailey--and especially Mesach Taylor (Hollywood) played, respectively, the Fairy Godmother, the Ogre, his evil Henchman--and the faithful Sidekick/Buddy/Wingman. They did so with such panache that they carried the story to the level of farce.The formula used in the movie for transformation I lost, but the point of this type of fairy tale is that Love does indeed transform people.There's a lot of bad reviews here, which is unfortunate. The movie was released in time for Valentine's Day.

65,nik_kas,Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,10,22 July 2018,"The Mannequin is one of those movies which you will either LOVE or HATE, that's that.
I first watched it i think when i was 10 years old (back in 1991) and i have to admit that due to my very young age i didn't value it nearly as much as i did when i watched it again at the age of 16 (or the next 10 times i saw it again since then).
Sure as many have pointed out it's not Oscar material (although lately the Oscars have fallen considerably in quality) but it's a very funny and romantic movie which will keep you company more than just 1 time. Of course both Andrew and Kim play extremely well (not just them, the entire cast is very funny and wild) and at the end of the movie you almost feel sad to let them go (i even had a crash on Kim back then, hell i still do whenever i see that movie).
Bottom line yes it's not as ""sophisticated"" as clockwork orange and people will go as far as to call it cheesy but any movie people can see again and again is grade A in my book and The Mannequin is just that, unforgettable (too bad it's ""sequel"" was the exact opposite).",Mannequin

70,DottoreHolliday,"Come on IMDb Users, It's A FARCE!",8,8 December 2013,"Evidently, the IMDb Users are not familiar with the farce as a theatrical form - a comic dramatic work that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable. Farces are often highly incomprehensible plot-wise (due to the large number of plot twists and random events that occur), but viewers are encouraged not to try to follow the plot in order to avoid becoming confused and overwhelmed. Farce is also characterized by physical humor, the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense, broadly stylized performances (buffoonery and horseplay) and typically including crude characterization and ludicrously improbable situations.Here a great cast of character actors and a supernatural plot, adds up to a farce. A form where great character actors Andrew McCarthy, Kim Cattrall, Estelle Getty, James Spader, G.W. Bailey and Mesach Taylor can ham it up and overact for the laughs. Even the minor players Carole Davis, Steve Vinovich and Christopher Maher continue the broadly played comedic characters with an excess of ham and absurdity.

You almost want to live in that era; you want to wear bowling shoes and drive a motorcycle down a deserted US road with a Mannequin on your back.It's not an intelligent film, the gags are slightly cringe-worthy and while the stereotypical gay parody can be funny it can also annoy you. Felix, the security guard with Rambo the dog does make you want to switch off the DVD and go and watch something with some more substance but don't. Hold back, and watch the magic unfold.Kim Cattrell makes this film light up; she is entirely believable as a soul who feels she hasn't lived and any moment of madness is relished. You can imagine her as a frustrated, contained soul in a birdcage who wants to be free, and Andrew McCarthy brings that out in her. McCarthy, although is often slated on acting ability actually plays the role well as a failed artist with questionable sanity once Emmy (Cattrell) comes to life.It is very much an 80's film, with an embarrassingly bad (but at the same time good) soundtrack that compliments the films message.

A salute to the golden comedies of the thirties, this film weaves love, adventure, mysticism and hijinx into a cloak of hilarity.  Andrew McCarthy plays Jonathan Switcher, a young artist who can't seem to find a job that will let him express his talents.  After rescuing the owner of a failing department store from almost certain death, he winds up assisting the flamboyant Hollywood (Meshach Taylor) to put together the store's window displays.  While working late one night, he comes across a mannequin he created in one of his earlier jobs...and magically, she comes alive before his eyes.  He falls in love with the strange, enchanting Emmy (Kim Cattrall), but their love seems doomed for several reasons, not least because Jonathan is the only person who can see her in her human form.  Throw in a rival department store, a jealous ex-girlfriend, a thrilling car chase, and a crazed night-watchman, and you have a recipe for fun.  Amidst a brilliant soundtrack and wonderful costumes, the performances at the centre of the movie (most notably, Estelle Getty, James Spader, Kim Cattrall, and the afore-mentioned Mr. McCarthy) genuinely sparkle.

The first time I saw this film I was 10 years old; it was my first Rom/Com and I completely fell in love with it. The basic plot is about a girl who wants more out of life than just to be married, (not that she doesn't want to get married- she just wants to find the right guy). Emmy wants to explore and invent and she knows there's a better way out there, so she appeals to the 'gods' of Eqypt asking them to show her the better way. They in turn make a deal with her. She can go through different times in history and seek out who and and what era is best for her but she can only appear alive to the ONE she's testing. She goes through historical figures such as Michelangelo and 'Chris' Columbus and finally lands in 1987 in the arms of Jonathan a nothing special struggling artist who can't seem to find a job. When she appears to him in the store window he fights to get a job to be close to the only thing that's made him feel like a real artist. As she comes to life, (only in front of him), she teaches him to loosen up and be who he his and he falls in love with her while making the most brilliant window displays for ""Price and Co."" With the crazy/cool story plot, great actors, and awesome music this film deserves an 8.5/10 (I NEVER give 10's- not even to my favourite film) because it's almost perfect. P.S.

80,tenjin-81214,Amazing Concept,6,21 September 2021,"The film had good ideas of what would have made a wonderful film. The actors were fine but the material that they were working with was sub-par. The most comedic thing about this movie is how many skips of logic the script makes. It expects you to just go along with a lot of things and as a viewer, it is sometimes a bit too hard to swallow all the weird stuff.The basic premise of this movie is reminiscent of a Disney Princess wanting more than what their time has to offer. Though it is a cliché, if executed right, it would have made a great entertaining and thought provoking tale. What this movie failed to do in its run time was developing the following things:1) a believable progression of love between Emmy and Johnathan
2) a believable progression of character growth (both protagonists and antagonists)
3) believable antagonists (They are excessively goofy)Despite all the negatives in this movie, in my honest opinion, it is still entertaining. The music scores are great, the visuals are great, and Kim Cattral is a certified hottie. I particularly liked the dress-up montages. The production team must have had a blast with them because they seem to be the best parts of the movie. And of course... Starship's hit single: ""Nothings Gonna Stop Us Now"" is a still to this day one of my favorite songs.Go 80s!",Mannequin
81,jholloway,Excellent all round film,10,6 March 2002,It is a pity that so many films are cast over with violence and massive budgets that you just don't care for. This film although not the best film ever made was funny charming and the cast worked well together. A great family film.,Mannequin
82,slithery_one,Psychological comedy,10,17 June 2003,"'Mannequin' can be viewed in two very different ways. One way to look at it is as a frothy, lightweight, undemanding fantasy comedy. Turn it on its head, and all sorts of Freudian theories undermine this film and elevate it immediately into the realm of a 'higher concept' film...Switcher doesn't necessarily see the mannequin come to life. Movies can play with the audience's expectations in inventive ways (see 'Mulholland Drive'). The film shows a representation of a dummy accumulating human characteristics, so are we instead witnessing the representation of the mind of a madman? Everything points to this theory - Switcher's unhealthy relationship with the mannequin BEFORE the mannequin begins talking to him is an early sign of his problems. Later, after the dummy has 'come to life', he seems oblivious when his ex-girlfriend sees the inanimate object on the back of his motorcycle and offers to get him help. Surely Switcher remembers that only HE can see the mannequin 'come to life'.Switcher spirals out of control and battles with his split personality and interesting fixation with plastic models. Offensive stereotype Hollywood also seems to be his only other friend. It is also debatable whether he really exists also, as it is hard to imagine someone so unbelievably colorful in real life.Gottlieb presents the viewer with a film to delight and provoke in equal measures, showing he really is up there with the likes of Cronenberg, Lynch, Pasolini and Waters. A maverick film for the stale 1980's era of film-making.",Mannequin
83,picturegallery12345,I Love This Movie. It Is So Enjoyable.,10,5 October 2004,"It's about a guy who is down on his luck has an incredible woman come into his life and make his life better. The only problem is that she is a mannequin who only comes to life when no one else is around.Kim Cattrall is amazing. She is beautiful, sexy, fun, loving, and full of life. She makes the fantasy character ideal and personally I think that she deserves an award for this film. Andrew McCarthy is also very charismatic and likable in this film.This movie is light, silly, funny, romantic, and very entertaining. It's a feel good movie definitely worth watching.10/10",Mannequin
84,SweeptheLegJohnny2,A Harsh Critique,10,30 June 2005,"This movie would have been gooder with Michael J. Fox. It is my firm belief that Michael J. Fox would have provided a more believable and emotionally stable lead. While Mr. McCarthy does have his charms, he falls short of sincerity while bonding with what should be portrayed as his true love. Unfortunately his courtship with his prosthetic beauty only seems to further the patriarchal attitudes of the mid-eighties. The OBJECT of his affection is given life only through his desire for her. From this one might conclude that a woman cannot be considered a person without a male counterpart to represent her and give her a venue through which she can legitimately voice her concerns. This train of thought reluctantly leads us somewhere that even Margarette Atwood would prefer not to go. But man, that Hollywood, LOL.",Mannequin
85,newyorkcity092603,out of 10...i'm gonna vote for 10...,10,10 September 2005,i was 13 when i first saw this movie mannequin. since then i got a crush on Andrew McCarthy. he was so cute and adorable. i loved his eyes and the way he smiles...it really tickles my bones every time i watch that movie. i even own my DVD now so that when i feel to watch it again i don't have to rent a movie because i've got my copy already. this was a great movie in the 80's. i hope you could provide me more movies of him.i have a question was there any part 2 of this movie? it's so sad that other people rated that film below as 5 because for me it was completely job well done. as a daydreamer like me because i used to fantasize all the time this movie was perfect for me. i wish i could see more movies of him. the first time i watched that movie i was with my friend because we both admired Andrew McCarthy so from then on we kept on looking more movies of him but we didn't get any that's why please give us any idea on how to search more movies of Andrew. even my sister and her group of female friends when my sister borrowed that DVD of mine they got amazed either. she even said to me that her friends really enjoyed watching that movie. they all got a crush on Andrew too. so you guys out there try to watch this movie and absolutely you're gonna like it. i hope you could be able to help me find more movies of Andrew because i was desperately looking ever since. try to watch that movie and wish that you're the mannequin because that's my fantasy.,Mannequin

87,daikichi,Greatest Love Story Of All Time,10,7 April 1999,"This happens to be Crow T. Robot's and my favorite movie.  A far greater love story than Titanic, this movie weaves fantasy, adventure, and comedy all into one highly enjoyable package. Stars one of the best actresses of the 80's: Kim Catrall.  Highly recommended.",Mannequin
88,perfecto,The finest film ever made,10,8 August 2000,"I have watched this film so many times (over a thousand) I can repeat it line for line in my sleep. Everything about it is amazing. From the great gags to the best soundtrack ever heard in a film (where can I buy that opening Belinda Carlisle track) . It honestly never gets boring. I can't explain why, but no other film I have ever watched, has as much watchability as this one.All I want now is it to be released on DVD, so listen up Warner Home Video you biscuit brains, release it now. Please.",Mannequin
89,jacquin,Saved by Andrew McCarthy!,8,29 November 2000,"This is a pretty bad movie, actually a really bad movie but it remains one of my favourites because of Andrew McCarthy.  He is just so great to watch and I think he is an amazing actor (even if he was in Weekend At Bernies). Bad performances, writing and directing are all saved by Andrew!",Mannequin
90,huntd001,80s romcom starring Kim Catrall and Andrew McCarthy,10,15 May 2006,"i watched this film and thought it was fantastic. when i was younger it was the first movie i can remember seeing that wasn't a Disney film! i recently bought it on DVD because i had never seen it the whole way through. i didn't expect to love it as much as i do now, after watching it! i really love the motorbike scenes and thought when they were dancing around the store was so funny. i think Kim Catrall played the part really well and the character is so different from her character in sex and the city. i definitely recommend seeing this film, even though i mainly watch more recent films, i thought this 80s movie was funny, witty and original and the chemistry between Kim Catrall and Andrew McCarthy was spot on!",Mannequin
91,neitharcher,So cute and funny! I was smiling the entire time!,9,28 September 2020,"I love the casting in this movie. I think they all fit each character perfectly. The story was so cute and funny. I first saw clips of this movie in Starship's music video for their song ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" and I'm so glad I got curious and watched the movie itself! Gonna watch it again actually!",Mannequin
92,numberfivehargreeves,Made me sad :(,1,17 June 2021,"That mannequin talked to him, but Delores still won't talk to me. Ah, how the world is unfair. Maybe it's because the lady in the movie had legs? I should probably look up some nice prosthetic legs for mannequins. I could probably find some at Kohl's.",Mannequin
93,carlsimmons-27798,Lose yourself in this comedy hit.,10,25 June 2021,"I love this film, it's from a time before mobile phones and the internet. Give it a watch.",Mannequin
94,HotVidMan,Philly in da house!,7,29 April 2007,"Hello, Aside from this being a decent flick, with come real good actors when they were YOUNG, it is also a great movie for those that might recall some locations in and around Philadelphia. The department store was the famous Wanamaker's Department store in center city Philly, near City Hall. It was there FOREVER and was very well known for it's big Christmas display and show in the incredible lobby. Now when you see them go down into the basement to the ""club"", in reality the cast and crew relocate to another old Philly suburb classic, a now vanished club called ""Pulsations"". They make it seem like this is located below Wanamaker's, but in reality it is about 15 to 20 miles south of Philly near the Delaware border or actually closer to Chad's Ford, PA. This was a REAL hot spot on the lines of Studio 54 (actually designed by the same designer too). It all was just as the movie depicts it, even the robot and space ship! For those of us that enjoyed going to both of these places, this movie is a chance to see them again in all their glory! Enjoy!",Mannequin
95,havfrogwilltravel,Great comedic performances,10,28 June 2007,"James Spader was un-self-consciously ingratiating and brown-nosed as the smarmy rival manager. It's clear that he was not taking himself too seriously. Felix,the insane security guard played by GW Bailey was hilarious and his poor dog (""OH Rambo"")was a riot. He was so earnestly trying to do as his obnoxious employer wanted and was so really offended by the shenanigans with the ""dummy"". These portrayals, as well as the flamboyant window dresser(Meshach Taylor)are absolutely brilliant. James Spader's Mr Richards foreshadows some of his performances in ""Secretary"" and""Boston Legal""...He has a knack for playing ethically impaired business people. I LOVE this movie!!!!!",Mannequin
96,iceman50432004,Amazing Movie,9,18 September 2007,"I'm saddened by the low rating of this movie. I grew up watching this movie, and indeed, looking at this movie now... it is a little cheesy, but its the 80's!! Still, Hollywood makes this movie, along with the security guard and Rambo. Kim Cattral... I've had a crush on that girl since I first watched this movie when I was 6. Any guy should just watch the movie for her cause she's beautiful.The Soundtrack (or what lil there is) is amazing. ""Do you dream about me""... great song for the movie. Basically what I'm trying to say, if you don't like this movie, you gotta have no humor or no taste cause its sweet. I rated it a 9 cause its not an Oscar winner, but its a movie that will stick with you throughout your life... I swear I'll be like 50 years old and still watch this movie. So, if you haven't seen it, go rent it, or buy it.",Mannequin
97,hideousmonster,Surely one of the best things about the 80's!,10,29 January 2003,"Personally I think people who hate this movie just don't understand this type of entertainment.  Its over-acting, its soft-core porn-like plot, its cheesy cartoon opening credits... they all make it clear that this movie was made in the eighties. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""So, it was made in the eighties.  How does that make it a good movie?""  It doesn't, but this movie was very entertaining to teenagers, and it became very well-known to them in the eighties, so by watching this movie, you get a very good picture of what teenagers were like at the time.  It's so ridiculous that very few teens today would enjoy it.  I mean it features a guy whose million-dollar clothing store might go out of business because his advertisers can't possibly compete with some guy's window displays!  Do you have any idea how insane that is?  It's clear to me that the movie ""Mannequin"" was meant to entertain those who can relate to it the most: dummies.  Now, make no mistake. That's not an insult toward the movie.  I love the movie.  Why? Because of the style of the movie.  I like comedy that mocks other comedy, and this kind of comedy would be extremely fun to see being mocked.  When you watch this movie, don't be critical of it.  Don't see its terrible acting and insane plot as a bad thing.  Watch the movie, and let yourself get into it.  Picture yourself in the shoes of a person who would love the movie. In fact, do that with every comedy you watch.  If you can't, then pretend the movie is mocking other movies like it.  Don't let yourself become ""too good"" or ""too smart"" or ""too mature"" for any brand of humor. If you ever catch yourself taking any humor seriously, you've forgotten the point of humor.",Mannequin
98,coffeecustard-500-484778,Enjoyable feel-good movie AND James Spader,8,7 January 2013,"If only for James Spader's unbelievably excellent depiction of a character that kisses major ass in hopes of furthering his career, this movie is a must-see. But that's not the only good thing about it. Andrew McCarthy is delicious, the few kisses far and between are actually pleasantly hot, and the 80s decor and fashion are a wonderful reminder to those raised in the 80s that we lived to tell about it! It's a lovely little feel-good movie with the added bonus of James Spader's superb acting and 100% devotion to the role as usual. There are far worse ways to spend an afternoon, and James Spader is a GEM that those who haven't seen the movie have robbed themselves of enjoying. His portrayal is spot-on and actually wildly humorous in patented James Spader understated brilliance.",Mannequin
99,Saharasunbloom,"MIX OF SMARTS, MAGNETISM AND PASSION",10,9 November 2004,"I luv this movie ever since I first watched it when I was seven..I wanted to be just like Emmy, full of energy and enthusiasm, and a rebel at times.. The character Jonathan Switcher had passion, no matter how many times he got fired, his fire never burned out.. And Mrs.T saw that in him.. if only we could appreciate our talents, our lives wouldn't be so routine and predictable.. And Hollywood Montrose was just simply hilarious!!! Not to mention his ""BAD GIRL"" pink cadillac, ah!, what a goof! And of course, there's the antagonists Felix who was pessimistic about every little thing, and it's fueled by Mr.Richards conniving, greedy, brown noser executive type attitude, a complete snob by all means.. only because he wanted a piece of the pie.. just like everybody else.. including Roxie.. The jealous ex.. And Armand, the average guy, who was always after Roxie like a little puppy on a long leash.. because he was never going to get what he wanted.. And B.J. Wert who thought he could get away with it.. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who miss the good IL' movies..",Mannequin
100,Chrissy_Mac,"Mannequin is odd but great, the best film I've ever seen.",10,22 September 2004,"I cant believe just how good the movie is. OK it'll never be nominated for an Oscar and the cast aren't the most well known, but the soundtrack couple with the carefree plot, and fun filled scenes, make it one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Kim Catrall is unbelievably good looking and that is and added bonus to the movie, and even Andrew McCarthy has a rougish charm. I first watched the movie when I was 6 and have loved it since. I don't know whether or not its the tunes or the film, but whatever it is its taken my heart. The thought of dancing through a deserted store with that wonderful Alisha song (Do you dream about me?) playing in the background must appeal to any seasoned lover of movies just like this?",Mannequin
101,chip_shop,Still a feel good movie,10,5 January 2019,"Just watched this movie again, potentially for the first time in 31 years and still loved it. Introduced my daughter (16) to it. She also loved it.
Feel good, happy ever after, romantic comedy with the best song ever ""Nothing's going to stop us now!"" Highly recommended.",Mannequin
102,eloisejamess,Amazing,10,23 January 2021,"This film has, and always will be my favourite film regardless of what anyone says. It's quirky, it's funny, it's romantic! A slightly bit cheesy but it makes me smile and that's what I look for in a film. I've watched it ever since I was little and I've always enjoyed it and still to this day I love it!",Mannequin
103,simslife,A good romance movie,8,28 December 2017,"I don't quite understand its relatively low ratings and reviews, as I found it to be a fairly good movie for its genre, while at the same time being unique/bringing something new to the table other than the typical clique romance you'd expect. Was also surprisingly ahead of its time, having an openly gay character as a friend to the protagonist (although he was highly based upon stereotypes). However, left some pretty important questions unanswered, to the point parts of the movie didn't totally make sense. Ultimately, worth a watch",Mannequin
104,than-95896,life is too short enjoy every defining moment,8,12 August 2018,This movie is corny this movie may not be the best but I am turning age 60 and this movie came out when I was just about to become a dad. The songs from the late 80s are the best for me and on lazy Sundays its a joy to watch Kim and Andrew make magic every time and take us all back to an age of innocence. Starships's Nothings gonna stop us now makes us pick ourselves up and get going again. I pick this movie as one that uplifts spirits when we are down.,Mannequin
