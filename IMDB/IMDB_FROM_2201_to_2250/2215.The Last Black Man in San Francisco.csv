0,nogodnomasters,The world put him in a box.,4,30 August 2019,"Jimmy (Jimmie Fails ) doesn't live in San Francisco in a four million dollar home. He lives in an area where people are shot and the environment is unhealthy. He visits the home that his grandfather built, the first black man in San Francisco. Eventually, Jimmy and his friend (Jonathan Majors) squat the place with the expected results.Reminds me of the BS stories my dad used to tell me. Jimmy can't move on like most of us, so let's make a film and toss in some social commentary without mentioning drugs or racism. There is a metaphor in this boring film disguised as art. Finn Wittrock reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio when I could stand him.Guide: F-word. Old male nudity. No sex.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
1,Quinoa1984,"""You can't hate (a city) unless you love it.""",10,3 July 2019,"You know, as someone who has been an almost New Yorker my whole life, I'm not sure if truer words have ever been spoken about a city (and to a... Hey, that's Thora Birch in a movie again!)It's hard for me to find the right or easy words to compare this to other films because Im not sure I've seen something quite like it. Maybe there's aome fluorishes of cinematic (and I mean fully, lyrically, poetically, if not quite to the philosophy plane) that Malick does, but only in fluorishes. Someone I read said Scorsese in some of the surreal touches. But this has such a lush look and feel, and in depicting not just how a place is on the surface but how it feels and its soul, what the people mean in it as well as the smoke and fog and the flowers and trollies and the whites and the blacks and those in between, that it feels akin to a city symphony film... That also happens to have a strong story about two friends trying to figure out their place in life/the world/San Fran/that house that was (but wasn't) build in 1946 by our heros grandfather.It's a film by Joe Talbot - and holy moly do I want to see everything he will do for the rest of his life - that doesn't shy away from, for lack of a better phrase, lifting ones spirits while at the same time depicting the people in these places as honestly as possible. That may be slightly Scorsese as well, without as much or the usual element of street crime... No, that is there, but it's like this presence that is there but, one hopes, only on the periphery... Until it isn't. These two friends just want to live on their own terms, as far as the basics of a place to live that makes one feel at peace, and also for a place to create (one draws and writes plays, the other keeps fixing up the house to look just right).What's against them? The conflict? Oh, systemic racism and poverty, class warfare, throw in some gentrification too; an interesting but important side note too is the detail that the neighborhood with the coveted house used to be Japanese dominant, until WW2 changed that with the camps, then black people cane in (and then the... Last 25 years of making everything prohibitively expensive to live in a city that isnt on the fringes). One (more ignorant) might look and say, ""pffft, get a job and work so you can get that house, or who even needs that house anyway.""But this is ignoring everything that makes up the foundation of these young men and what their options are. At the same time, this is all larger-issue points that come up when looking at the films characters and this beautiful but complicated (and sometimes quite violent) world of San Francisco. Why it's so great is that the filmmakers find fresh and original ways of bringing visual umph and lift to the emotions they're feeling - or that they would like to feel, or aspire to.Like Moonlight, this is a filmmaker (I mistakenly assumed he was black but looking at Talbot that's not the case, albeit a native of SF) looking at life in a city and showing us something we either may have not seen before or not in such a way that demonstrates what cinema can do. It can bring us up as well as crash us down. It can find the unique and... Unusual people who may be frankly neglected by those in a city who would look the other way (or not at all). It can make us laugh at some absurdity, or, in a lot of cases here, make us unsure what to feel at times, like at one point where the theatrical playwrite artist comes in to the group of street guys (all of course talking s***) and acts as though he is putting on a play with them (a Stanislavski mention gave me a big laugh). And it can make us wonder what is in ourselves and what we want out of life and what it can provide as well as easily/tragically/crushingly take away.This feels really special, in ways that another viewing will hopefully make clearer. AND it's the *other* (superior) black-led film this year where ""I Got 5 On It"" gets belted out.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
2,CinemaSerf,Needs the script to be tightened up.,7,30 November 2019,"This film probably suffers a little because it is subtle. It isn't one of the more typical ""in your face"" portraits of African American identity. Whilst it lacks any significant emotional charge; and at times plods along a little - it did leave me with an appreciation of the close friendship between the two lead characters and of their legitimate but fruitless battle against the gentrification and sanitising of a San Francisco community by those with more money and no local roots. It might well improve with a second viewing, and I was surprised to see people leaving midway through.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
3,view_and_review,You Can't Hate San Francisco,2,25 June 2019,"To be perfectly honest, I only watched the movie because of the title. Being from San Francisco myself I was more than a little intrigued. After watching it, It seems like the title was the only good thing about this movie-if you can consider the title good.Obviously, the movie takes place in San Francisco. I don't want to attempt to say what it was about because I'm sure I'll be wrong. Rather, I'll say what I think it was about.The two main characters were Jimmie Fails playing Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors playing Montgomery Allen. I recognized Jonathan Majors from a movie earlier this year titled Captive State. They were two odd friends. I say odd because I couldn't understand them. I didn't understand their actions, their emotions, their motivations, nothing. Jimmie was grim, deadpanned guy obsessed with an old Victorian home that he used to live in on Golden Gate. Even though it was occupied he would go there and touch up the paint and other chores. Montgomery (Mont) was an artist that just tagged along with Jimmie. Mont drew and he was perpetually working on a play. A play he'd eventually finish and make him an even weirder guy.The two of them thought they had it made when the Victorian house was vacated. Now they could squat there and claim it as there own. That, or come up with the $4 million it would cost to buy it.That's as much as I gathered from the movie as far as a plot. There were other side stories that gave more insight to these two main characters but the side stories also made the two main characters more enigmatic. The movie started slow and ended slower. I was patient with it because I can be patient with a movie and allow it to develop. What developed was nothing worth waiting for. Heck, one couple, maybe smarter than myself, left midway through. That exiting couple was a third of the audience.Without being overly critical I'm just going to call it too artsy for me. This was one of those movies where just about everything had to be inferred and interpreted. Even the main conflict-if there was one-was nebulous. I don't need to be spoon fed but I don't feel like staring at abstract art either.To me it was all too strange. Their friendship was strange, their daily routine was strange, it was strange how Mont just stared at the four regular locals as they hung out, it was strange to show some random old white guy plopping down at the bus stop fully nude, and Jimmie's obsession with his old house was strange. I mean, I have fondness for the place I grew up but that's where it stops. We live in a place, sometimes we lose that place or we just move on, then that place is just a memory. Maybe, if we had fond enough memories and the ability, we try to purchase that old home. That's as far as that fondness should ever go.The only bright spots of the movie were the appearances of known actors. Mike Epps' brief spot was funny. Tichina Arnold and Danny Glover only provided a familiar face because they certainly didn't provide any credibility. To their defense, it was nothing they could do. This movie may have wowed some but I'd have to ask why.I'll end with a quote from the movie that only summed up how odd it all was. There was a scene where Jimmie is riding the bus and these two women were discussing their disdain with San Francisco. They weren't conservatives at all by the looks of them, they just didn't like the city for whatever reason they mentioned. Upon hearing that, Jimmie Fails says, ""You can't hate San Francisco.""One woman responds, ""I can hate whatever the (expletive) I want to hate.""Jimmie asks, ""Do you love it? Because you can only hate it if you love it.""What!?! That's it, I'm done.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
4,evanston_dad,Gentrification in San Francisco,8,7 October 2019,"Beautiful cinematography and a wonderful use of music highlight this melancholy, moving film about the gentrification of San Francisco that is pushing black communities to the polluted fringes.The film feels a hair or two shy of reality, existing in a rarefied world where visual poetry supplants gritty realism, but I very much enjoyed the vibe this film generated and was able to relax into its aesthetic. It's got two impressive performances, one by Jimmie Fails, who also co-wrote, as the main protagonist, a young black man who squats in the vacant home that formerly belonged to his family; and the other by Jonathan Majors, who plays his artistic best friend. There have been a lot of welcome and very good black-themed movies in the last year or so, and this one shares more of the elegiac tone of an ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" than the angry energy of a ""BlacKkKlansman"" or ""Blindspotting.""I will say though that one revelation about this film changed my impressions of it a little bit for the worse, and I'm not sure whether or not it's fair of me. I assumed the creators of it were people of color, and that what I was getting was a film from a black perspective. But then I discovered that the director and producers are white men, and now I'm not so sure how I feel about it, mostly because I no longer know whether or not this film is authentic to the black experience. It still has good things to say either way, and it certainly doesn't traffic in the same kind of cultural appropriation as something like ""Green Book"" from last year, but I have to admit that I'm not sure how I feel about consuming black stories as told by white people.It is a lovely film though, and it captures a lot of the magic that the city of San Francisco has exercised on me personally from visits there. Which makes it all the more tragic that it's becoming a city that's out of reach for most middle class Americans, let alone disenfranchised minorities.Grade: A",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
5,gbill-74877,Seeing the city in a new light,8,10 March 2020,"One of the great things about a film like this is it forces me to see things through another's perspective, and to try to get at least a glimmer of understanding. This film is also simply beautiful, with gorgeous cinematography and strong performances, Jonathan Majors (Mont) in particular standing out. There may have been some issues with pace and an unevenness to the plot, but they were more than overcome by several stellar moments:The main character, Jimmie Fails (playing himself) running into his mom on the bus, and finding out just how sad/non-existent their relationship is. Without a shred of melodrama, this scene was heartbreaking.The way white people look at them, clearly with a sense of ""other"", and a mix of fear, disgust, and anger in their eyes. The way they talk to them too. The enormous barrier at a basic human level as a starting point, before you even get into gentrification and everything else.The white people partying on the cable car bus, living it up, and then seeing this poor black guy and a completely naked white guy sitting there at a bus stop.The play scene, with the scathing commentary about the insincerity of blithe posts to social media, and then these stirring lines, grappling with the shooting death of a young black man:Jimmie: ""People aren't one thing.""
Mont: ""That. All of it. What would have happened if Kofi could've showed himself? All forms of himself. The world put him in a box! And he never pushed beyond it. Let us. Let us break the boxes! Let us give each other the courage! To... To see! Beyond the stories we are born into!""Lastly, the use of the song ""San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair),"" which given everything else seen in the film, cast the lyrics and the city in such an incredibly different light for me personally.Throughout the film, friendship and masculinity are also explored. I loved seeing the nuance and thoughtfulness of these characters, and the film is one that stuck with me. Last little note: the house is at 959 South Van Ness, in the Mission District, just a mile and half away from the Castro Theater, where the film debuted.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
6,Cineanalyst,The City a Stage,8,9 June 2020,"This is a thorough mix of the structures of a city symphony and the play-within-the-play, also called ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco,"" a title that alludes to the gentrification of the metropolis that has forced African Americans to its margins, with the picture further comparing this segregation with the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII that removed another racial minority from the city by the bay. Gracefully, the movie doesn't hit us over the head with this message, though. Moreover, it's critical, but also celebratory of San Francisco. To paraphrase its protagonist, Jimmie Fails (as played by the real Jimmie Fails), you can't hate the city without loving it. Hence, the oratory of a man ranting on his soapbox re the men in hazmat suits cleaning the bay turns into a melodic montage of Jimmie and his best friend Mont skateboarding through the city's streets. There's more of this sort of skateboarding footage and inserted images of random citizens later in the picture, as well. It's an aesthetic that's reminiscent of one of the most unique and avant-garde genres to emerge from the late silent film era, the city symphony, including such entries as ""Manhatta"" (1921), ""Berlin: Symphony of a Great City"" (1927) and ""Man with a Movie Camera"" (1929), but also reemerging in later dramatic films, such as the opening sequence of ""Manhattan"" (1979). The genre is quite congruent, too, with the movie's reflexive play-within-play structure, a far older theatrical device dating back to at least Shakespearean times, whereby the city becomes a stage on which the play is written and enacted.Naturally, then, there's the character who is a playwright, as the movie's surrogate author--the role occupied by Mont (Jonathan Majors) and, assumedly, standing in for writer-director Joe Talbot who based the screenplay on the real life of Fails. Mont does something similar with the play nested in the movie. We also see Mont draw and reenact ""playing the dozens,"" which he's witnessed daily in front of his and his grandfather's home. The game of dozens works well here, as it's something of an art of wit itself. Architecture is exploited adroitly in this regard, as well, with the play staged in Jimmie's childhood and ancestral home, which itself recalls its and the city's past occupation by Japanese, as well as African, Americans. Even bootleg DVDs are assembled by Jimmie's father in another building, while Mont explains the images of movies on TV to his blind grandfather (Danny Glover playing sightless again, à la ""Blindness"" (2008)). All of San Francisco is art here, and if residents or owners neglect to keep it that way, Jimmie shows up to paint the window trim, tend the garden and furnish the interior.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
7,eddie_baggins,A handsomely crafted love letter to San Francisco,7,29 June 2020,"As a piece of debut filmmaking and as a love letter to the unique American city of San Francisco, Joe Talbot's dreamlike The Last Black Man in San Francisco offers much for audiences to enjoy as the up and coming director produces a beautiful ode to his every changing hometown, one that is constantly evolving around an every changing cityscape that harbors many stories, secrets and links to the nation's past.Winning the directing award at last year's Sundance Film Festival and produced by Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner's Plan B production company, Last has come from humble beginnings to become one of 2019's most talked about sleeper hits, as Talbot's intimate character study and city examination entails much to be said about the American landscape and its history, all around a likeably slight plot line of Jimmie Fails obsession with restoring an old house in the city built by his grandfather to its former glory.From the moment we join the film with Fails and Jonathan Major's loyal friend Montgomery Allen listening to an African-American preacher proclaiming in the streets against the backdrop of a fog filled San Francisco backdrop, Talbot is setting the agenda for his unique film that is brilliantly captured by DOP Adam Newport-Berra and memorably scored by Emile Mosseri, helping ensure that Last has a style and substance all of its own to be enjoyed by cinephiles enjoying its oddball delights.There's a tone and feel to the film that's not dissimilar to a Spike Jonze or Michel Gonroy picture, and while the film has a whole may not end up as fully formed as the best of those directors works, it's great to see original filmmaking alive and well in the Hollywood system, that has seen a resurgence this year and last of the smaller character driven films that have shown they can compete in a market place filled with remakes, redo's and big budget failures.Key to the films enjoyment outside of the vibe Talbot manages to create is the performances of Fails and Major's who both excel in their respective roles as men lost within a city they no longer fully understand.Fails in particular is awards worthy as his namesake, a man driven close to insanity by an insatiable quest to reclaim a piece of his and his cities history, it's a fully formed performance by the up and coming star who shines in a cast that also features neat small-scale turns by the likes of Danny Glover as Allen's elderly relative and Mike Epps as a local street hood Bobby.It's a shame the film loses some of its energy and verve in a more middling middle section but bookended by a fantastic opening act and a generally moving finale, Last is a strong contributor to a top class collection of independent films that are making their marks at the end of year awards seasons.Final Say -An original piece of American filmmaking, The Last Black Man in San Francisco carves out a unique identity for itself as it lovingly pays tribute to the city in which it is based and puts director Joe Talbot's name up as one of the up and coming directors to keep a very close eye on.3 ½ skateboard rides out of 5",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
8,howard.schumann,Captures the bonds of friendship that transcend changes brought by social and economic dislocation,8,2 August 2019,"The San Francisco I knew as a young man was a place with a sense of community and culture that welcomed the adventurous, the imaginative, the creative, and the marginalized. Though, like every other major U.S. city, it was not always a place of harmony, and some neighborhoods had its dangers for outsiders, yet it was a city with a truly diverse population and a rich bohemian culture which has now all but disappeared. Joe Talbot's first feature, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, laments the heart of a city that has been broken by gentrification but celebrates the beauty that remains. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra, and aided by a pensive score by Emile Mossei, the film is an affecting work that is based on Talbot's lifelong friendship with Jimmie Fails who plays a fictional version of himself, a young black man estranged from a place that he once called home.Winner of the Directing Award at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, the film opens as two men, Jimmie (Jimmie Fails) and his best friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors, ""Out of Blue"") wait impatiently for a bus to take them to the city as a droning preacher (Willie Hen) stands on a soapbox shouting ""Remember your truth in the city of façades."" It is a message that reverberates throughout the film. Mont and Jimmy are headed to an old Victorian home on Golden Gate Avenue which Jimmie claims his grandfather built in 1946. The house, in what used to be a working class neighborhood, was lost by his father James Sr. (Rob Morgan, ""Mudbound"") in the 90s and Jimmie is obsessed with getting it back.With pride, Fails claims that his grandfather was the first black man in San Francisco. Though this is little more than an urban legend, it provides him with a rationale for what he thinks is his historical claim to the house. Much to the chagrin of the older white woman (Maximilienne Ewalt, ""Sense8"" TV series) who owns the house, Jimmie often comes to touch up the paint on the windows and take care of the lawn but has to duck the fruit the owner throws at him while demanding that he leave the premises. The taciturn Jimmie works part-time as a nursing home attendant and Mont works at a fish market though he is also an artist, writer, and playwright.Sadly, Jimmie's family is scattered and he has no home. He sleeps on the floor of Mont's house and, in an evening of warmth and friendship, they are shown watching the 1949 San Francisco film noir ""D.O.A."" on TV together as Montgomery narrates for his blind grandfather (Danny Glover, ""The Old Man & the Gun""). Across the street from Mont's house, a group of young macho studs taunt the two friends presumably for their lack of ""toughness,"" but it later becomes clear that much of it is posturing. In two striking scenes, Jimmie travels across the bridge to have some reflective conversations with his Aunt Wanda (Tichina Arnold, ""Wild Hogs""), and in a funny but heartbreaking encounter, runs into his mother on the bus but their reunion is as uninvolved as it is fleeting.To underscore the sense of displacement, Bobby (Mike Epps, ""Resident Evil: Extinction""), a friend of James Sr., lives in Jimmie's dad's old car and insists on giving the two friends a ride into town which they reluctantly accept. In a scene that typifies the old spirit of San Francisco, Fails sits on a bench and is joined by a completely nude, older man (David Usner, ""Roxie""), a scenario that scarcely raises an eyebrow with the exception of some rowdies passing on a tour bus. Things turn when the current owner of the old Victorian dies and it looks as if a legal dispute will tie up ownership rights for some time.Acting quickly, after a real estate broker tells them the house would cost four million dollars to buy, they transport the family's old furniture, mostly still in good condition, into the mansion and move in as squatters. Though Jimmie still follows his dream, he knows that trying to recreate the house as he remembers it is a delusion, a fact he is forcefully reminded of by Mont in a play performed before a small audience in a corner of the old house. The Last Black Man in San Francisco captures the bonds of love and friendship that exist between people, bonds that transcend the changes brought by social and economic dislocation.To put it in perspective, Reverend Danny Nemu once said, ""Some mourn as their edifices crumble; but for the open-eyed and uninvested, all that is lost is that which lies between them and deeper understanding."" Talking about his relationship with Mont, Fails agrees, ""All I want is for friendships like ours to be able to exist,"" he says, ""and that doesn't exist in the new San Francisco. That's really what it's about, getting back to that point where artists and outsiders can live there. Where weirdos who didn't feel accepted could come because that's what it used to be about. That's the best San Francisco in my eyes."" It is the idea of San Francisco The Last Black Man in San Francisco lovingly conveys.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
9,paul-allaer,"The search for home, and for one's self",7,30 June 2019,"""The Last Black Man in San Francisco"" (2019 release; 120 min.) brings the story of Jimmie and Mont. AS the movie opens, Jimmie and Mont are waiting for the bus while listening to a black preacher who's preaching to no-one about the toxic clean-up taking place nearby. Jimmie and Mont decide to skateboard into SF city, to look at the house that Jimmie's grandpa, whom people nicknamed ""the first black man in San Francisco"", had built. Jimmie would love to get the house back, and starts fixing up the outside, much to the chagrin of the white couple that owns it. ""I'm gonna call the cops if you don't leave"", says the woman. ""No, you're not"", her husband responds... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the remarkable feature-length debut from director Joe Talbot, who also co-wrote the story along with Jimmie Fails. Yes, Jimmie Fails plays a version of himself in the movie, and the story is partly based on Jimmie's life experiences. While the movie's concrete themes are very obvious (and let's be clear, gentrification is not an issue that is singular to San Francisco, it happens in all larger cities including right here in Cincinnati), the broader picture is that Jimmie is searching for a home, and for his self-identity. Danny Glover plays the earlier mentioned grandpa (who now is blind). I thought the movie is a bit too long for its own good, a tighter edit could've easily trimmed the running time by 15-20 min. without losing any of the movie's essence. Let me also mention the gorgeous orchestral score, composed by Emile Mosseri, which I will definitely check out.""The Last Black Man in San Francisco"" premiered at this year's Sunday film festival to immediate critical acclaim. I had seen the movie's trailer and couldn't wait to see it. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening was attended okay for a matinee (11 people, including myself--but not a single African-American among them). If you are in the mood for something that couldn't be further away from the latest Avengers/John Wick/Godzilla/Men In Black/Shaft/Child's Play garbage that Hollywood keeps throwing on us, by all means I encourage you to check out ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
10,subxerogravity,Wonderfully out there!!,8,11 July 2019,"That quirky storytelling that you're use to seeing in white movies is now being done for movies with black cast. Ever since Get Out these movies started to pop up. Last year it was Sorry to Bother You and Blindspotting. This year it's The Last Black Man In San Francisco. A similar off beat tale but tone with a more dramatic make that the two former, which were more styled as comedies. I wonder if that has to do with the first two movies being about the Oakland area while this movie takes place across the bridge? Something to think about but either way for me it was a refreshing movie to see.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
11,Turfseer,Allegory of inner city house squatter remains ambiguous,4,25 November 2019,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco stars Jimmie Fails as a poetic, allegorical version of himself. Jimmie plays opposite Montgomery ""Mont"" Allen (Jonathan Majors) who is his best friend. At first, one might speculate that the two might have a thing for one another-but as the story proceeds, it becomes clear that there is no hint of a sexual relationship between them.
Indeed, Jimmie's sexuality is completely ignored by screenwriters Joe Talbot and Rob Richert. Instead, Jimmie is cast as a sort of black everyman, almost child-like in tone, and a clear victim of gentrification. We find out that Jimmie had a tough childhood, spending some time in foster care. We meet his father, James Sr. (a street vendor who sells bootleg DVDs) who's obviously been tough on his son for his entire life. It also appears the relationship with his mother was distant.
The break into the Second Act occurs when Jimmie and Mont discover that the old Victorian house he grew up in, is now vacant, due to a dispute between warring sisters. Jimmie has somehow deluded himself into believing that this apparent 19th century structure, was built in 1946 by his grandfather. He visits a sleazy realtor and bitterly reacts to the asking price which is over a million dollars.
Rather unrealistically, Jimmie begs the unsympathetic realtor to allow him to buy the residence and he promises to make good on all the installment payments. The realtor ends up laughing in his face so Jimmy decides to move in anyway, after calling on his aunt, who has housed all of the grandfather's old possessions in her garage.
The scenarists here argue somewhat ambiguously that Jimmy's grievances may be justified-that gentrification is the result of the haves taking advantage of the have nots and Jimmie, somehow may have the right to move into the house, solely on the basis of having grown up at that location.
If reality intrudes at all in this allegorical story, it revolves around Jimmie's childhood friend Kofi, who is part of a group of macho ne'er-do-wells who hang out across the street and disparage both Jimmie and Mont. Kofi is later killed by street thugs as a result of a meaningless exchange of insults, typical of the gang culture in the inner city.
The film concludes right before Jimmie is evicted from the residence. He invites members of the community to hear a play put on by Mont, who at first eulogizes the slain Kofi and later praises Jimmie, only to soon afterward reveal to his friend that he's learned that the house was not built by Jimmie's grandfather and he has been deluding himself all along.
The denouement is ambiguous. Jimmie leaves a farewell note to Mont, thanking him for being a good friend, and then is seen rowing in the waters near the Golden Gate Bridge, as Mont watches him from a dock. Has Jimmie simply decided to make a new life free from illusion? Or has he decided to throw in the towel-for good?
What exactly is the message of The Last Black Man in San Francisco? Is it about a vulnerable man who has had hard knocks in life and is the victim of dark forces (including racism)? Of course there are people who have had ""hard knocks"" and ended up feeling defeated by forces that they viewed as beyond their control.
Instead of unrealistically harping on and taking possession of his childhood home, why does Jimmie dwell in the past? Why can't Jimmie pro-actively get a job and save money in order to buy a modest place of his own, instead of acting like a child, and moving into a place that does not belong to him? If there are people like that, should we still have sympathy for them? The filmmakers seem to insist that we still must have sympathy for the downtrodden, even if they take no steps to better themselves..
Somehow there is a suggestion here that there are two types of victims of racism. The one represented by Kofi, whose macho posturing led tragically to his death. On the other hand there's Jimmie, who takes refuge in self-delusion after falling victim to the forces of racism (represented by the forces of gentrification in the neighborhood). Lost in all this is the issue of self-responsibility. Did Jimmie finally get himself together at film's end-did he finally become responsible for his own actions?
The Last Black Man in San Francisco has some remarkable cinematography with an extremely engaging score. But the child-like, allegorical tone of the screenplay ultimately rings false. Jimmie has no one else to blame but himself as he is an adult, not a child. And the ambiguous ending does little to instill the need for a positive message, which appears to remain elusive throughout the entire film.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
12,Kdosda_Hegen,"All style and nice story, but slow and lacking.",6,10 April 2020,"As title says the style is great, music is well put, cinematography is fantastic and story is interesting, but on the other hand it is a slow movie, pretty bland actually.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
13,masonfisk,WONDERFUL FROM START TO FINISH...!,10,21 March 2021,"A Sundance hit from last year which follows the odyssey of 2 black men (Jimmie & Mont) in current day, overpriced San Francisco. Jimmie keeps returning to his (as he sees it) ancestral home which he claims his grandfather built in the 1940's. At the moment however a middle aged white couple own the establishment & as is par for the course the relationship between Jimmie & the couple is strained (we first see the couple catching the man touching up some paint on one of the window sills) but then a death occurs & the wife of the couple is embroiled in a legal dispute leaving the house abandoned giving Jimmie & Mont an 'in' to reclaim the property. Excitedly they hurry over to Jimmie's aunt (played by Tichina Arnold who I remember as one of the trio of back-up singers from Little Shop of Horrors) to get whatever furniture was relocated from the prized manse when Jimmie's family lost the house some time before but no sooner than each of them have selected rooms & have adorned the home then a real estate agent (played by Judy's Finn Whittrock) has caught wind of the squatters & tossed their decor to the curb. What follows is a litany of bitter truths Jimmie has to learn as what he once believed becomes upended & he has to determine how much of this unattainable dream he still wants to hold onto. Acted, directed & shot like a tone poem (much like Oscar winner Moonlight), this tale of working class souls trying to get theirs in the new millennium is bittersweet, revolutionary & ultimately idyllic. Kudos to all around for such a stunning debut especially director Joe Talbot.

14,valleyjohn,Great acting but iot lacked a certain something.,7,6 March 2020,"This is the story of Jimmie and his best friend Mont who try to reclaim the house built by Jimmie's grandfather in 1946 and it sends them on a journey that connects them to their past, even as it tests their friendship and sense of belonging in the place they call home.I'm not quite sure what to make of this film . There is no doubt that that it looks fantastic and the acting is superb , especially from Jonathan Majors but I'm not 100% sure it works as well as it should . The premise is great . The way Jimmie is in love with the house his grandad supposedly built is great . In fact , he loves it more than his dysfunctional family who haven't always been true to him .I think the film loses it's was towards the end . The play they put on in the house doesn't feel right and confuses matters some what .
The one really good thing that hopefully comes out of the film is the discovery of the two leading actors Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors . They really are impressive.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

17,kjproulx,"A Superb, Thoughtful Character Study",10,14 August 2019,"I've been thinking about calling A24 one of the best studios making films today, but it really hit me while watching The Last Black Man in San Francisco. This is a studio that very carefully picks their projects and more often than not, finds great material to release. I now believe they are not just one of the best, but the absolute best of the best, especially when looking at the films released by studios throughout this decade alone. This character study is one of the best films you will see this year.Jimmie (Jimmie Fails), finding it hard to cope with the fact that the house his grandfather built may be taken away from him, leaving him with nothing, takes it upon himself to find a way to hold onto it. That's the core premise of the movie and with a strong friendship between Jimmie and Montgomery as the backbone of the dramatic aspects, this is a film that places its main character front and center. With a well fleshed out character that has me engaged from start to finish, you've already won me over, but there is so much more to love and admire here.Adam Newport-Berra is at the helm as the film's cinematographer and I truly believe this has set the standard for the year. I would be absolutely shocked if he doesn't receive a nomination for his work in the coming months. On top of that, being director Joe talbot's first feature film to be released, it goes without saying that he is a filmmaker that's here to stay and I am giving an early prediction that, if not this year, there will be an awards season in the coming years that consistently rave about something he has done. The Last Black Man in San Francisco is littered with talent from top to bottom.This movie would be a technical achievement in independent cinema regardless of the material being shown on-screen, but the fact that these technical aspects are buoyed by a central performance that truly moved me was another level of special. Actor Jimmie Fails plays a character by the exact same name and there may be personal influences that helped his performance here, but a great performance is a great performance nonetheless and he delivers one of the best I've seen all year so far.In the end, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a film that takes its time in setting up the scenarios at hand, dives deep, and eventually delivers a very touching conclusion that had me totally invested. With superb direction, camerawork that deserves many awards, a score that soothes the mind as you're watching, and a core performance that elevates the already great material, this is a film that surely can't be missed. This is one of the very best movies I've seen all year.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
18,ThurstonHunger,A house is not a home...,9,3 December 2019,"...sometimes it's more.Just as sometimes a story about gentrification can be a lot more too and include some fantastic and fantastically flawed friendships. I thought the film was artfully assembled, from the cinematography to the amazing music to the skateboard scenes (one of which felt like an homage to the old surf movie heyday as Jimmie was riding an asphalt crest) to the use of a play within a movie.I cannot speak to the authentic African American experience as I've read some others report, but my fellow Weird Americans I suspect will resonate with this like they would with a Paul Beatty novel. The filmmakers even include Mike Epps in an art car and a Jello Biafra driveby with a segway segue.Some folks already know, but after watching it I learned about Jamal Trulove's true story, which is up there with the larger than life true story that Jimmie Fails puts on the screen here. Not only does Jimmie star in it, he pulls in his film-making friend since high school Joe Talbot, for Joe's directing debut.Feels pretty DIY to me, this film has a gentle authenticity even amidst scenes both of outrage and the outrageous. I bet a lot of season directors will admire the performances by all in the cast, but for Jimmie to get that/offer that from himself.

The characters are compelling (and complex), and the direction is absolutely breathtaking. It is a proud and poetic look at some folks who want far more than housing. They want a legacy that lasts, and the stories they tell each other reflect juat that. But it is not a perfect film either - the plot's pacing could have used some work, and at points the story seemed more focused on creating the perfect moment than just telling the story. Still, the film finds its footing and makes an impact, partly because it figures out the relationships that most deserve attention.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
20,andrewroy-04316,An artistic look at the relationship between a man and his changing city,7,14 December 2019,"I feel pretty similarly about The Last Black Man in San Francisco to The Farewell: both have a specific focus and set of ideas, which are explored narrowly but deeply, and both were light on plot but with some significant artistic merit. Last Black Man has some gorgeous shots and several great scenes, but for the most part is a meandering, sad story of a man trying to hold on to a city that's moving on. The central theme of the movie is gentrification, how in this case Jimmy grew up in San Francisco and felt like it was his city, idolizing the house he grew up in, but when he tries to move into the house he is shoved aside. The scenes in which Jimmy is fighting for his home - early on painting the house, arguing with the realtor in his office, and walking out of Montgomery's play - were the best in the movie. The score is really well done and ties scenes together effectively. The very end of the movie was also a strong point, both encapsulating their friendship as we see Montgomery ride around the city alone as well as in Jimmy accepting that it's a different city and he moves on. Visually engaging and accurately portraying modern human experience, it's a film worth watching.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

24,dommercaldi,"Beautiful, Stylistic, Wonderfully Acted, But Lacking In Plot Substance",7,19 August 2020,"Pros:
1. The fantastic score is virulently lively, and it encompasses the film in feelings of wonder, yearning, and loss.
2. The cinematography is gorgeous, with the pulled-back camera giving a light and spacious feel to the movie, whilst utilising close-ups to hit-home the emotions.
3. The lighting sets the mood perfectly, with the colours brightening for positive emotions, and darkening for their negative counterparts.
4. Both Jimmie Fails (Jimmie Fails) and Jonathan Majors (Montgomery Allen) deliver great performances.
5. The film handles contentious issues, such as gentrification and black thug culture, exceedingly carefully and thoughtfully.
6. The death of Kofi (Jamal Trulove) is brimming with emotion and heartbreak, despite the fact he's an unlikable secondary character.
7. The ending is tragically beautiful as Jimmie Fails and Montgomery Allen accept that San Francisco is no longer for them with all its changes.Cons:
1. The sound-mixing, on a couple of occasions, is a little off.
2. The substance of the plot is rather thin, as the themes of change, gentrification and black thug culture are more important, thus the movie kind of meanders from one scene to the next.
3. All of the limited white characters are presented as cheesy caricatures of white people.
4. The play scene wherein the truth about Jimmie Fails' grandad is revealed to him, comes across as forced and far too over-the-top.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

28,bastille-852-731547,"Well-Made, Thoughtful Yet Ever-So-Slightly Empty Drama",7,15 June 2019,"This independent drama on the effects of gentrification in San Francisco played to strong reviews at Sundance. It's also distributed by A24, and their films are generally very high-quality. Judging from its trailer, the film looked to be a mix of understatedly beautiful aesthetics (including some extraordinary cinematography of the Bay Area,) searing character drama, and social commentary. The film is generally well-made, and some aspects of it are undeniably impressive for a directorial debut.The plot follows a man named Jimmie, whose grandfather built a house in San Francisco on land he purchased during World War II. Today, Jimmie wishes to live in this spacious Victorian house, but its market value has skyrocketed due to gentrification of the neighborhood (and nearby neighborhoods) near where it is located. He begins to develop a scheme with his best friend to move into the house. The film's cinematography is exceptional, and manages to juxtapose both realism and romanticism in terms of how it depicts both the ideals and the realities of San Francisco residents today. Some of the film's shots may remind viewers of Spike Lee's early films, but the film's aesthetic always feels wholly original at the end of the day. The film also uses a variety of other visual and narrative tricks, such as a tableaux vivant-style scene, to help convey the points it is trying to make on how gentrification is affecting relationships between people in urban areas today, much less exacerbating social inequality. The film's simple score is beautiful and almost haunting at times in terms of its elegance and emotional power. The performances in the film are generally strong, as the almost laid-back method acting of the two leads is thoughtful and impactful in its sheer simplicity.Despite the film's clear achievements on a technical and narrative level that intersects strong performances with aesthetics, ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco"" isn't perfect. The film doesn't have too many key plot points, which would normally be okay given the film's understated tone. However, the film does feel rather drawn-out in that the narrative doesn't always impact even scenes in which the director is trying to promote substance over style. The narrative's climax is also a bit disappointing. It lacks a clear transition both preceding it and after it, and doesn't quite pack the impact on a viewer in which a film's climax should. That said, the ending is generally satisfying. Also, the film's social commentary is a bit of a mixed bag in that it shows the ways in which gentrification has affected San Francisco--yet it manages to reduce supporting characters both benefitting from and greatly harmed by gentrification to almost caricatures. As a result, the film's messaging on the perils of gentrification in cities comes up just a little short, and clearly falls below the effectiveness of social commentary in films like ""Get Out."" That said, there's definitely plenty to like about this indie drama. Generally recommended. 7/10",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
29,eyeintrees,Odd and brilliant,10,27 March 2020,"I pondered about this and in the end could only rate this movie with a 10 because I couldn't really go anywhere else with it. It's quirky, sad, genius, odd, remarkable and truly, deeply touching to anyone who understands how painful it is to be one of the 'non belonging', to be disenfranchised, to be deeply in need of beauty and culture and something much more than the transitory misery of many of life's realities.
Intelligent young men trapped in 'wrong' lives who will possibly never be able to aspire to their true callings for no other reason than money and 'loss'.
Some parts of this movie are so brilliant that it can only be understood when watched from a place of deep empathy. Other parts are barely possible to understand at all.

32,IamROCKAS,"Too many ideas, too little time",4,4 March 2021,"There's no place like home for our main protagonist, Jimmie Fails, portrayed by Jimmie Fails. To him - the only place he wants to call home is the house his grandfather built in the 1950s. He grew up in that house, learning and retelling the story of its rich history until his family lost the house. The displacement Jimmie feels can be observer through most of the shots in the film and gives off a feeling of strangeness and melancholy, a sadness, that just makes you feel bad for the guy, which's interesting to see in the context of the film. And even though I did feel sad watching the story unfold, this movie didn't push out any strong emotional response from me and the whole movie felt like it's better at coming up with interesting ideas than exploring them.There's a lot of things going on outside of the path our main protagonist is taking. There are fishes with too many eyes, thanks to pollution, there are nudists on the street and street prophets, that wind the streets. At one point I even thought this might get really experimental, kind of like Under the Silver Lake did with a lot of going on that the protagonist ignores, as his search dismisses a lot of horror going on around him, but The Last Black Man in San Francisco didn't take that turn. But overall, this movie feels like a hangout movie than anything else, at very least, Jimmie and his best friend Montgomery hanging out with limited conversations beyond their lives and problems.I wasn't really sure what the film is actually about and I can only conclude that it's a lo-fi movie with the only objective being to get Jimmie back into his house that's simultaneously raising questions about black masculinity. It's mostly slow and it seems deliberate and even feels depressive, as it's full of close-ups and slight pushes towards the actors' faces. To some extent, it event felt like this is a movie that carries a meaningful messages for people that have experienced or taken part in the story, unfortunately, it's hardly translated to people outside the reality that is the displayed plot. In other words, those, who haven't been to San Francisco or haven't been in the situation Jimmie Falls is in, wouldn't get it. And I certainly didn't get it enough to have strong feelings about this movie. To me, it's a movie that displays beautiful scenery that seems to be taking be towards something but talking about getting there than actually enriching the experience of getting there.What really didn't work for this movie that encapsulates emphatic identity crises, is the montages of black men shouting epithets at each other and challenging each others' masculinity. For some reason, they're displayed as people that can only be described as thugs. For me, it felt odd for a film about displacement. It got even weirder when the soulful music cue of Joni Mitchell's Blue started playing during one of the scenes. A song that touches on depression, general sadness, and the ways people use to escape from those emotions, told over a beautiful piano melody, and the images of the same black gentlemen shouting slurs at each other hurt my heart more than anything else.Overall, I don't think the film is consistent with what it wants to say, what it seems to want me to care about, which kind of distracted me from what actually happened. A lot of questions have been raised, but only a few explored.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

36,skinnybert,A lot to like,7,6 September 2021,"First, there are GORGEOUS shots all through this film. Second, Jonathan Majors and Tichina Arnold (and Danny Glover and ....) -- OK, I'll just say the casting is really outstanding. Third, the filmmakers clearly had a lot of feeling in making this; there couldn't be a more loving tribute to Hunter's Point and the people who live there. Makes me want to go visit ... whereupon the people who actually live there would probably give me the evil eye, wondering what I'm doing there.Which brings us to what this film lacks: it's so full of feelings, which the audience may or may not share, that it sometimes neglects narrative force. So many scenes are lyrical moments of passing. I sometimes felt restless for something more to happen between the passings ... and then sometimes there is more, and it's happening during the passings, but without explanation or rationale. I guess these are nods to the historically-treasured wackiness of San Franciscans themselves, because I know such people exist; to the average viewer, they may just be distractions.Which leads us to this film's most noticeable distraction: it is chock full of diverting loose threads. Many, many things are included with no apparent connection or payoff, suggesting more than they actually deliver. The net result is a smorgasbord of a film that feels strongly, but doesn't always seem to know why. Or, perhaps, they just aren't telling -- taking an ""either you get it or you don't"" mentality, and making the film for those who do. And even if I'm one of those who maybe do not, I still appreciated the warm characters, and how beautiful it was in many of its shots. Definitely recommended.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

It's simple, solid, with emotion, friendship, love, loss, a yearning for meaning and fitting in. Of course it touches on race relations and black poverty, but in a way completely off centre to most approaches. I loved this film.Do I recommend it? It will be like savouring a fine wine on an evening. For many, it will be fulfilling, touching, deep and profound. But some people don't like wine. Those that want action/love story/radical race politics, won't find it here.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

52,kaneeddy,Genuinly Moving,10,27 March 2020,"Joe Talbot's The Last Black Man in San Francisco is close to being one of A24s best films, the opening is phenomenal and it carries that momentum throughout the whole film. The score is one of the best I have heard and the cinematography is fantastic. The screenplay is also great providing so many twists and turns within two hours and covering all these plot points so seamlessly, and giving you a lot of emotional payoff that is tear inducing. The performances from the two leads Jimmie Fails and Jonathon Majors are both Oscar worthy.This film manages to cover deep themes as well, and moves between a few topics that are interconnected with the characters, it manages to implement these themes so seamlessly using themes such as: How we treat others, how we perceive people, and a place being intertwined with your identity so well that it makes the characters instantly relatable. Also the production design and costume design are all gorgeous to look at, and they tie together with the cinematography so well.Overall, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a criminally underrated film that deserved a lot more attention than it got.

Although I agree with some other reviews that the plot isn't very strong and sometimes fails to come through, this movie is more about interpretation and reading into the meanings of what the actors say rather than their literal words. Cinematography was stunning. Realism and friendship captured well. An eccentric movie made for those who like to think outside of themselves.

I even found the melancholic atmosphere of the film to be cozy at times. However, I just couldn't stand the story and the portrayal of the lead character which were simply unrealistic and implausible. I understand that this was a house he had grown up in. It was also a special house because he believes that the it had been built by his grandfather. But that doesn't give him the right to just move in unlawfully and pretend that he owns it. He acts like a little kid claiming someone else's toys as his. Or perhaps, none of these ""little things"" matter if we consider this movie as a modern-day fantasy tale.

In no other film would you find real life actors(I am not sure about this one) that play marvellously alongside. The plot is inspired by Fails real life , adding to the realism. The cinematography is quite unorthodox , yet maintains a certain charm. Joe Talbots direction is brilliant and quirky.My only real complaint would be that this movie is a bit tiring and leans slightly towards obscurity.

It's absolutely gorgeous.It's directed by Joe Talbot and stars Jimmie Fails, Jonathan Majors and Danny Glover to name a few.This movie is beautiful. It feels like the baby of Wes Anderson and Damien Chazelle. The directing is my favourite aspect of this movie. From the opening scene to the final shot, this whole movie is beautifully filmed. There isn't a single scene that isn't stunning. The cinematography is top-notch fantastic. There are shots which are just basically art and sequences that I repeated in my head over and over again. It won Best Directing at Sundance so I'm hoping it gets some recognition from the Academy.The story is by both Fails and Talbot themselves. And it's excellent. It's joyful, sad, inspiring and meaningful. The writing was done by Talbot and Rob Richert, and that was very well done too. It feels natural and it keeps you engaged. There were also a few allusions between the dialogue and I appreciated that a lot.The performances, particularly by both Jonathan Majors and Jimmie Fails are phenomenal. They are the soul of this movie. There was just the perfect amount of joy or anger or sorrow or regret throughout their performances.The movie clocks in at just over 2 hours and honestly it's perfect.

Let down by a poor story.",6,22 November 2019,"Joe Talbot first feature Movie The last black man in San Francisco has been getting a lot of buzz around the festivals this year and has been on my watchlist for a while. After seeing the movie there are aspects of this movie that do live up to all the hype, but there are also things holding it back from greatness.
let's start with the positives, for a debut feature film, this movie is nothing short of a marvellous achievement. Seriously from a technical point of view, this is clearly someone who knows what they are doing. Talbot is able to show such skill behind the camera and prove that he is a name to look out for going forward, throughout the film the atmosphere of San Francisco just bleeds through the screen, the gorgeous cinematography and impressive camera work on display here is nothing short of mesmerising. There are countless long shots that just allow the city of san Francisco time to visually breath and for a low budget film likes this certainly impressive. The Acting was amazing across the board. There was not a single weak link in the entire cast. The score was also fantastic and there are scenes that are elevated by the music, including moments with licensed songs that felt purposeful and didn't feel cheap.
From a visual standpoint this movie is something special, unfortunately that's where the positives stop for me. My main issue with this movie is its core, its story. Unfortunately, there really isn't that much of an engaging story to be found here. That not to say there aren't any redeemable qualities. The first 10 minutes start of extremely strong and completely set the tone for what's to come. However, after that I spent the rest of the movie expecting some kind of Initial incident that sets the ""real"" story in motion, but it never came. The main driving force for the characters in this movie was just not well developed at all and I found myself struggling to understand character motivations, which at first, I assumed was intentional but as the film ended it was clear that I wasn't going to get the answers I required. On that note - no spoilers but the ending to this movie I found to be completely unsatisfying and disappointing. There are revelations that the movie insists are big dramatic moments however for anyone paying attention it was obvious already. Maybe on a second viewing ill find something that makes me appreciate the story more but as it stands right now, I just didn't find the film had much of anything to really latch onto in this regard.Never less - I have my problems with the story and wasn't exactly what I would call engaged. However, without a doubt this is one of the best-looking movies of the entire year, with some great acting and characters to boot. I hope Joe Talbot continues into a career in film because Im a fan and will be going to see whatever he works on next",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
69,cupofsoulshow,Gorgeous,9,18 July 2019,"Family, Legacy, a House, friendship and the city by the bay are some of the underlying themes of ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco."" Based on the true story of Jimmie Fails. It's a resonating story of how a house becomes the centerpiece of survival while highlighting a unique friendship.The movie opens with Jimmie and Montgomery waiting on the bus. Every free moment they have evolves around ""The House.""The House is a home that was allegedly built by Jimmie's Grandfather and was the last home Jimmie had before having to endure homelessness and group homes.Director Joe Talbot is a fifth-generation San Franciscan. It shows in every frame of this movie - the tight shots of Jimmie and Montgomery Skateboarding through San Francisco are visually pleasing while intersecting comedic characters. It's San Francisco from a local's point of view.Jimmie Fails makes a stunning debut as himself. Although he's reliving his life, there's a full-fledged character on the screen. We are rooting for Jimmie as he works through every obstacle to regain ownership of his family legacy.My favorite character in this movie was Montgomery. Montgomery is eccentric. Jonathan Majors turns in a fantastic performance. He attacks this role with every fiber of his being, and it shows. Montgomery is comfortable with who he is unlike Jimmie.The onscreen chemistry between the two characters is also another reason why this movie works. It's evident in the opening scene when they are waiting for the bus. The observations they share are fluid and natural.Tichina Arnold portrays Jimmie's aunt, Wanda. Arnold brings her famous wit to this role.Veteran Actor Danny Glover, in my opinion, has the best twenty minutes of screen time as Grandpa that we've seen him deliver in ages. He's Montgomery's cheerleader and never makes his grandson feel odd for his eccentricity.Another notable mention goes to Mike Epps as Bobby, the homeless OG. Epps continues his streak of playing smaller but strong parts in good movies.Everything works in the movie. The dialogue written by Jimmie Fails, Rob Richert, and Joe Talbot is robust. The writers tackle many tough topics.Topics such as gentrification, effects of drug abuse, inner city violence but at heart, and the focus always remain with Jimmie and Montgomery. Their unwavering love and support towards one another are what drives this fantastic movie.Another positive is that their relationship is genuine. We don't often get to see two black men loving, and fighting for each other.Kudos to A24 for continuing to support movies that touch the soul.I highly recommend this movie and pray that it receives the proper marketing and rollout. The performances deserve to touch a bigger audience.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

I love all of the city of San Francisco depicted (frat boys, singing men on the street, to even the relationship of the two protagonists and their friends who make fun of them).I love the movement of the film (eg. trolley, skateboard, bus, truck).There were so many excellent components that worked for this film and debut filmmaker as well as the cast and crew should be really proud of this release. I put this above other films I've seen recently in which they have more training so I expect more from them and was disappointed (eg. Midsommar, Motherless Brooklyn).Its the commitment to the fine details, the architecture of the house (when the protagonists lived in there versus when the house was open for a viewing and the interior changed), that makes me think highly of this film.Something I wish they could have explored more in the film was the hazmat suits and the community that opened the film up. If the film contrasted more of what exactly was the air pollution and its impact in that community versus the Golden Gate house community, i probably would have bumped this up to a 9.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

Sundance movies are often rated high because they have the ""Sundance"" publicity attached, but they often choose movies that are politically correct and not because the movie is actually good, in my opinion. Acting was good, although the characters boring. Did you ever think about throwing a little humor in with such a dialogue-driven (yelling) movie? Writing, editing, and directing very bad.

There's a lot to like here, but the entire film feels low energy, cold, and distant. I could often tell what the director wanted me to feel, but I rarely felt it. It's occasionally on the nose and a bit young in it's writing. This one definitely felt like a film by a fairly inexperienced filmmaker. I'm a huge supporter of A24 films and I find that they put out truly interesting and innovative work. I will say that this is a risky film about a very important topic and I thank A24 for putting forward.I'm going to rewatch it when it comes out on streaming and maybe I'll feel different them.

I also found it difficult to understand the speech in many places, as the diction and the dialogue audio tracks were not uniformly clear. My not being familiar with black, urban slang and its pronunciation did not help. I also found the editing disjointed, so it was difficult to identify the message of the film. What it had to say about modern San Francisco could have been said in half the time and film space. But, the length was appropriate for the development of the black characters.

As a viewer, I appreciated the great attention given to creating unique shots that emphasize shadows, light, and especially the gorgeous color-grading of this film.Every actor delivers outstanding and memorable performances. Jimmie Fails is so natural as a brooding protagonist, but Jonathan Majors who plays Montgomery Allen steals the show in the third act.The premise of the film seems simple, but the storytelling is complex, featuring stretches of dialogue that some audiences might not have the patience to handle.

Jimmie and Mont do not know who or what they are, and their desire for self-exploration is quietly but sharply derailed by the gentrifiers who are limiting their expression.the film highlights the emotional bond formed between a person and a place, and it proficiently captures the emotional process of slowly coming to the realization that we do not really own the places within which we form deep, meaningful memories and experiences. In his fight to keep this house, Jimmie is fighting to retain his self-identity, or whatever is left of it. when critically considered, the house is nothing but a metaphor for Jimmie's identity, which the new invaders are slowly wringing out of him.The Last Black Man in San Francisco is filled with emotion and personality. it's real and relatable. and in a year that's been filled so far with blockbuster superhero showdowns and remakes, this feels like a very much needed, and refreshing breath of fresh air.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

We all hold on to something that creates a sense of security for us, but is not founded in reality. That fiction might be based on a person, a relationship, political views or anything else might make us happy. That is the heart of this story. It puts a mirror up at us, and makes us question our own fictions and reality. What is real? The hardest thing in life is to come to terms with our self created fictions and fantasies. Its so hard, it can tear us and our relationships apart.I have read the reviews of some people claiming the movie is boring and slow, and I think the pace is just right.

We follow the journey of Jimmie Fails IV and his bestfriend Montgomery ""Mont"" Allen as they try to reclaim Jimmie's childhood home. Jimmie and Mont are seen as oddballs but that is okay since San Francisco is an odd place or at least it used to be. A tragedy occurs midway through the film which tie all the themes together. People define homes not the other way around and what makes home meaningful is human connections. But what happens when people can no longer afford to create a home which I think the film captures especially at the end. As for my critiques, the side characters although interesting are not given much to do. And the big conflict in the movie has no tension whatsoever. There is a revelation about the house which I don't think the film does justice to. Also while Jimmie Fails did fine in the role I think he was too subdued with his performance there are times I wish he switched places with Jonathan Majors who portrayed Mont.

Besides this major theme the movie maker/creator and star Jimmy Fails has done an exeptional job showing us the beauty of the city San Francisco. The movie sheds a light on the hardships of the inner city and it's brutal and ungrateful stance towards it's original residents. This he was able to do with great integrity and an eye for detail. The film paints a tough and frustrating picture of current life in the big city, but also shows the strength (and complexity) of friendship, family and community.

Gentrification, racial tension, poverty, friendship, & loneliness get displayed though art-house gravitas, but nothing seems to quite click: the parts are there but I struggled to put them into a coherent whole. The house at the center of the plot seemed to have too much metaphoric weight to it & felt dark & claustrophobic. The characters inhabiting it obviously felt things but I couldn't see it in the performances, which seemed wooden, as they wandered through the film's heavy atmospheric wasteland.

The City is a character and breathes in a way not shown before on film. It's the small places shown, the neighborhoods that don't make it into other movies, the light and the cold. The sense of longing is strong in this film. The characters, all of whom are a bit off, long for a stability that isn't there, but that they all hope for and work towards. This is a movie about people who are being crushed in a variety of ways by the workings of capitalism and keep struggling forward. It's not a political movie or an obnoxious ""message"" movie. Nothing to hit you over the head. It just shows you folks. This is a love letter to a city that ain't there anymore. A place where I grew up but am a stranger.

You hope for a film that offers originality and fresh perspective. The Last Black Man in San Francisco offers that and more.The two leads, Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors are magnificent, their magical friendship the nexus from which the rest of the movie revolves. It is a friendship that transcends sexual definition, but is romantic, powerful, resilient and transformative.Director Joe Talbot tells the story of the gentrification of San Francisco and the demise of the African Community. His vision is layered, sweeping, original and stunning to see. It makes those of us who experienced San Francisco in its earlier days lament the current edition, the diversity and magical quality that once resided in that fabulous city.The two lead actors attempt to fight a fate that is already sealed. Their adventure is bold, daring, romantic and idealistic as they confront a harsh and ruthless reality. They are fighting for their existence, the soul of the City and their attempt is a mirror of modern day America.Great movies mean different things for different people, but what is universal of all great movies is their emotional power and the demands they make on the viewer to think and contemplate what you have witnessed.

I watched it not really expecting anything, but left it feeling like it had changed me. For some reason everyone seems to be talking about it like it's a movie about gentrification and racism, and while that's certainly an aspect of the film, it's about so much more than that. I saw it as being about our connection with the past and to the people around us, though I'm sure there's thing I didn't pick up on entirely. It wasn't afraid to be unique, or to be earnest in its goal. This certainly isn't a conventional film, and it has no interest in being one. It aims to move you in a way few movies do, and it succeeds wonderfully. Joe Talbot, a first time feature filmmaker, injects a wholly unique style to it, and Emile Mosseri's breathtaking score immerses you. The combination of Mosseri's score and the engaging visuals the story provides occasionally created a sort of out of body experience for me. I'm not the person to get overly emotional during movie, but this moved me to tears. After seeing it I'm genuinely shocked this didn't win any Oscars, despite the amazing year for movies it came out during.

Smalls' displays more subtle emotion, while Majors shocks you with an Oscar-worthy performance that packs so much emotion. I just wanted to cry the entire time.

This tale of longing, love, and hate, captures the complexity and mercilessness of displacement.Performances:
With the likes of Tichina Arnold and Danny Glover, the cast has incredibly solid support for the two leads, Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors. Majors presents one of the most intricate and delicate performances of this year, as Montgomery Allen. Jimmie Falls as the lead is also astounding, playing a version of himself in the film.Cinematography:
The poeticism of this piece is carried by its enthralling, detailed and ornate visuals. Its use of color, composition and light far surpass the rest of the major films from this year, and to an extent most films from this decade. This loving and sensitive portrait of San Francisco is authentic, sobering and luscious.

118,iseevictoryahead,PLACE ATTACHEMENT! Not just gentrification!!,8,7 July 2019,"This film is a very good tool to assist students (Urban Sociology) with understanding place attachment theory. The problem with just simply saying that this film deals with gentrification is that it ignores the human reality of place attachment, which always gets lost in the gentrification discourse. The Last Black Man in San Francisco brought to the big screen, the emotional bond between person and place, it captured the psychological/emotional process of realizing that the places (property, neighborhoods, communities) where deep and meaningful memories are made, don't belong to us, indeed our society is not conducive to this. It's part of the reason why the two main characters in this movie can be reduced by some viewers as being nothing more than 'squatting parasites' and 'perps' causing trouble in the city.The bus scene in the film ""you can't hate San Francisco, if you don't love it"" speaks to the difference between meaning and preference, meaning understood as the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape, and preference as the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another. The tech companies, bio-medical companies, and other industries have brought in outsiders who have taken over, displaced, and driven up cost that generational residents of SF can really no longer call home.The unfortunate truth about all this is that when these companies who brought in all of the outsiders who merely have a preference for SF have finished their stay, they will abandon these properties, neighborhoods, communities, and cities.

121,gwendalyngilliam,gets straight to the sad heart of what is wrong in our society and reaches in and grabs your heart and works that unbearable pain into it so that you feel it,10,13 January 2020,"Joe Talbot's The Last Black Man in San Francisco captures the sweet and scary edge of the city in unexpected and heartbreakingly beautiful ways. Produced by Brad Pitt, it shows the perfection of the raucous jumble of social classes there as Jimmy Fails (as himself) and Jonathan Majors (as his best friend Mont) enact an outlandish and somehow logical response to gentrification, putting a face on its inter-generational, emotional tragedy. The movie is colorblind as it shows the deep, innate desire in all humans to own a nice home.Everything is true to the bone, especially the power and authenticity of Mont's play.
The cinematography by Adam Newport-Berra toggles between stunning landscape portraiture and intimate conversation between camera and viewer. What struck me was the amount of time the main characters spend in silent contemplation. Not in formal meditation as I know it, but their main activity is sitting together and thinking, which formulates their lives' flow and wipes out all city noise.
Locals gem: Dead Kennedys founder and 1979 city council candidate Jello Biafraa cameos as a trendy San Francisco tour guide....
About the title: I believe it's saying that the reason Jimmy Fails is the last black man in San Francisco is that black men there have typically been reduced to frustrated sidewalk spouting of injustice rhetoric, or to making profound but penniless street art, or scamming (read: smart and respectable), all beneath a crushing understanding of the futility of cherishing dreams only available to a few, which will never be them, no matter how hard they try or what they have inside to offer.
The Last Black Man in San Francisco gets straight to the sad heart of what is wrong in our society and reaches in and grabs your heart and works that unbearable pain into it so that you feel it as your own personal problem. It's included with Amazon Prime. Do not dare to miss this if you want to understand the world and why it must change.

124,samtahsin,Review about The Last Black Man in San Francisco,8,16 September 2020,"Movie: The Last Black Man in San Francisco
Director: Joe TalbotThe central story here is about a young guy called Jimmie (Jimmie Fails), wants to belong somewhere in the rapidly transforming city. A Victorian house, located in the heart of the town San Francisco, was evidently built by Jimmie's grandfather in 1946 who was the first black man in San Francisco. Now it is Jimmie's desire to have it again because his father renounced it long ago. It seems like he wants to live in the past when everything around him changing rapidly. I have watched the movie as a fable where the house corresponds to Jimmie himself. Cause both are different from the rest of the things around them, on the edge of losing their personality in the sudden moving time.San Francisco always encounters housing problems and people are getting relocated and losing their homes. The pricing of the houses increased so much that they are pricing out poor people, particularly black people and they are becoming homeless. They are threatened to leave the city or to live in some low-area. Like this our main character of the movie, Jimmie also had to move out of the city and had to live in a home with other people before he got to settle down somewhere else. For that, he is back to the city for his old house that is grandfather built but now he cannot afford it. It demonstrates that we took pride in stuff that we think we own but in the end, we realize we don't actually own anything.Watching this movie I get a sense that this is very intimate work done by two friends Joe Talbot and Jimmie Fails. Fails has co-written it and portrayed his own knowledge of wandering for having a house in the city. In the movie, Jimmie goes to the Victorian house continually and works on it without any permission from its recent owner who does not take care of it. When the owner loses the house, Jimmie shifts in the empty house as if now it's his. Shortly he begins to get a connection with his surroundings. He changes totally and becomes more alive. The fulfillment of having the house for himself has shown beautifully by excellent camera work.During all of this happening Jimmie is supported by his friend Mont. (Jonathan Majors). Before moving into the house he was living with Mont., sharing his small room, drinking toxic water of a river. Mont. plays the main part that links between Jimmie and a group of boys which are the two different ends of their neighborhood. Jimmie is divided from his roots and that group of boys who have not found the roots yet. Both are equally empty inside in their own way. The character Mont. is very sensitive and observes everything. The way he always has hauled behind when Jimmie rides with his skateboard, to me it felt like Mont has hauled behind Jimmie and his ambitions. So when Jimmie shifts in his house and leaves him alone, he becomes disoriented. Personally, the character Mont was my favorite. I felt the pain when Jimmie left Mont.Watching this movie was a beautiful experience that made me feel for the people who can not say that they have a house to go to and also for the people who always left behind beside their amazing support to their dearest ones.I want to end this review with a line from the movie that I think is beautiful,""It bothers me, there are all these people in the street and these big old houses are just sitting there collecting dust.""",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
125,bob-2842,Nobody's Home,3,27 January 2020,"Beautiful cinematography captures a generally empty story. I had been told that this was the ""film of the year"" by more than one person, but 10-15 minutes in to it, it hadn't captured my interest, and unfortunately never did.

126,KnowTheScore,"A beautiful, melancholic love letter",8,29 January 2020,"The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a melancholic love letter to a best friend, a city that once was, and the person we think we see when we look in the mirror.The Last Black Man in San Francisco follows Jimmie, a homeless-orphan-now-elderly-caregiver struggling amidst a city that has forgotten his community. He regularly travels to a house in a now affluent area of San Francisco, a place Jimmie once called home with his estranged father and mother before they were forced to leave. Jimmie routinely fixes the house, much to the chagrin of the house's occupants, until they, too are forced to leave. Seeing the house as his birthright, Jimmie decided to do more than just repair the house - he decides to move in.Joe Talbot's directorial, semi-biographical debut is brought to life through expert cinematography, an engrossing score and stunning performances from a limited cast. Jimmie Fails, Rob Morgan, Tichina Arnold, Danny Glover and Mike Epps all shine by ebbing and flowing between nuanced, reserved delivery and charged dialogue. Jonathan Majors, however, steals the show as Jimmie's savant best friend and confidant.The film's vividly bright cinematography mirrors Jimmie's rose-colored view of the house, which represents a sense of home, belonging and purpose. Jimmie's be all, end all, is the house. He never wants to stop working on it. He wants to share it with his friends and estranged family. Jimmy is even willing to get an insurmountable amount of debt just to call the house his.What follows is not a romantic, reinforcement of this sentimentality but tragic indifference.The film instead reinforces what Jimmie comes to realize: while places can potentially define an individual, they do not make up a person holistically. While we can love a place, hate a place or make a place a part of who we are, we are ultimately meant to be more and do more. Just as you are not defined by your circumstances, you are not defined by where you live. While we can appreciate and take the best out of those things, much more goes into a person's being. Strive for an anchor if you must, but do not let that anchor sink your ship.I look forward to Talbot's future work, as The Last Black Man in San Francisco is easily one of 2019's best movies.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco

132,peterandrewalbert,Much More Than a Title,10,9 June 2019,"The trailer for this movie (which is in itself a wonder) set up some expectations for me, and they were met: it's a melancholy film about a black man feeling pushed away from the city he loves. But the movie is so much something more that I'm still reflecting on it three days after viewing. The film is gentle and expansive, anything but divisive or self-pitying: a celebration of the unique, oddball, all-embracing quirkiness that San Francisco inspires and cultivates. It's just as much about a friendship between black men that endures because of San Francisco's peculiarly protective cover. I came away moved by the friendship story - the kind of friendship that the film itself suggests changes lives and can survive gentrification.The trailer promises visual beauty and the film delivers, coming as close as a movie can to diagramming the cool, foggy spell San Francisco can cast - but the images on the screen are there to both break a heart and to inspire hope.And man, are these images beautiful! This movie is a natural addition to the ranks of ""Vertigo,"" ""Bullitt,"" ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Tales of the City"" - movies that lean on SF as more than a backdrop, but indeed as a co-star. It all works to underscore why the hero (Jimmie Fails, playing himself) is so compulsively distracted by, even focused on, his unsettled business with his hometown. Set to a dreamy score by Emile Mosseri and Michael Marshall's cover of ""If You're Going to San Francisco,"" there are moments in the movie that well up and stir; that are flat out unforgettable.",The Last Black Man in San Francisco
