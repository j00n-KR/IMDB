0,Leofwine_draca,A rare disaster flick in which the effects enhance the character drama,7,6 October 2016,"A good example of what all popular blockbusters should be like in a perfect world: character-focused dramas, where the special effects are used to fit the storyline and not to simply make up for the lack of a storyline. THE PERFECT STORM is definitely one of the best films of 2000, which in itself was a pretty good year for movies, and works because of the characterisation and acting involved, factors which really make us care about the people in the film before putting them through their paces.Nobody really puts a wrong foot here, whether it's George Clooney as the weather-beaten captain who won't take no for an answer, or Mark Wahlberg as a fresh-faced rookie who stays loyal to his captain through the hardest times. As well as these two, the whole load of actors playing the crew members are fine, playing refreshingly non-clichéd characters. Acting stalwarts Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Ironside also show up to lend some solid support in what is a uniformly excellent cast.The CGI effects of huge 100 foot waves are seamlessly integrated into the actual water used on set, so that you're never less than convinced that what we see is taking place in the ocean - credibility gives this film a big plus. The pacing is slow at first, as we get introduced to the situation, but the build-up and the final battle for survival is phenomenal and breath-taking, which is what a good disaster movie should be. And all the time avoiding the typical clichés which a number of recent movies keep falling into. Also, for a mainstream film, the film is unusually downbeat in a poignant way, made all the more heart-rending due to the fact that it's a true story. THE PERFECT STORM is a film for all the family and a fine example of what a disaster movie should be; not much could be done to better it, in fact.",The Perfect Storm
1,SnoopyStyle,took too long to get to the disaster,6,17 November 2013,"Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is struggling with a string of bad results. Others like Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are outfishing him. His crew is also struggling and they risk to go further than all the others. When their refrigeration goes, they either sit out the storms and lose their catch, or make a dash home through the Perfect Storm.The drama isn't really there. We all know what's going to happen. Wolfgang Peterson doesn't really give us any surprises, but quite frankly, I don't think he had any surprises to give. The background family stories aren't anything imaginative. He probably should have treated this like other disaster movies. Get to the disaster and have some action fun. It takes too long to get to the disaster.",The Perfect Storm
2,kosmasp,Based on a real storm/y,8,11 August 2012,"Fortunately I didn't know about the real story, because it would've spoiled the movie a bit for me. Which also means, I can't tell how people react to the movie who know the story and the outcome. Of course until that point, you never know how creatively free the filmmakers were or are with the facts surrounding something like that. But having great talent on board (no pun intended) helps a lot.And by that I mean the actors mainly. The director also though, a German who is used to shoots ""in the water"" (as one of his best movies ""Das Boot"" showcases!). Mix that with pretty good special effects (especially for the time it was shot, it still looks good) and you have a really good drama/thriller on your hands.",The Perfect Storm
3,lee_eisenberg,sailing time,8,18 October 2012,"I had never heard of the Halloween Nor'easter of 1991 until ""The Perfect Storm"" came out. Now that I've seen it, I shudder to think what a harrowing experience it must've been for the crew of the Andrea Gail. The movie does a really good job showing it. Not just an excuse for constant action and CGI, the movie gives the audience a reason to care about the characters.I understand that much of what happens aboard the Andrea Gail is speculation, since nothing was heard from the boat after the last radio contact. If in fact Billy Tyne really tried to sail over a mammoth wave, then he must've been one hardcore fisherman.All in all, this is a really impressive piece of work. An acquaintance of mine once went out on a fishing boat and survived a rogue wave, so that plus what I saw in ""The Perfect Storm"" makes me NOT want to be a fisherman. Worth seeing.",The Perfect Storm
4,jboothmillard,The Perfect Storm,5,14 December 2008,"I knew the two lead actors, and I knew the premise, and I think I knew it was based on a true story, and not a bad a film it turned out to be, from director Wolfgang Petersen (The NeverEnding Story, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One). Basically, it is 1991, and Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is the sword-fishing-boat captain of the ""Andrea Gail"", who has had a string of poor fishing outings, and his crew are a little concerned when he tells them they are going out again, in October when the weather can turn ugly. The crew includes young and newly in love Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), devoted and recently divorced father Dale 'Murph' Murphy (John C. Reilly), the guy he despises (and vice versa) David 'Sully' Sullivan (Prison Break's William Fichtner) and Michael 'Bugsy' Moran (John Hawkes). They aren't catching much, so Billy is taking a risk heading east, ignoring storm warnings, and it seems they catch a mother load. Unfortunately the ice machine fails, and they have to decide whether to wait for a huge storm to pass, or risk their lives and go through it, and of course, they want the money, so decide to go through one of the biggest killer storms in recorded history. Also in the North Atlantic waters are fellow sailors Christina Cotter (Untraceable's Diane Lane), Melissa Brown (Karen Allen) and Alexander McAnally III (Bob Gunton), who are luckily rescued by the near air freight helicopter, but they unfortunately cannot reach the ""Andrea Gail"" for fear of running out of fuel. In the end, you expect one of the crew members to survive that final skyscraper size wave, living to tell the tale, but none are ever seen again. Also starring Scarface's Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Linda Greenlaw, Christopher McDonald as Todd Gross and Michael Ironside as Bob Brown. The story isn't too bad, the cast is quite good, and there are some gripping moments as the crew members fight for their lives in this very thrilling storm, a good drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Worth watching!",The Perfect Storm
5,rmax304823,"Wind, Force Plenty.",7,14 February 2009,"It's almost the opposite of elephantine epics like ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor."" Those were stereotypic stories of romance padding out an action scene or two. Should she affiliate with the lower-class guy? Which of two daring lovers should she choose? This one has half an hour or so of realistic introduction and the rest of the movie is slam-bang action.In the course of that introduction we meet the crew of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail and a couple of their friends as well. The introduction looks grounded in reality. George Clooney, as the skipper, is hounded by the penny-pinching owner of the boat and hopes to make a killing this time, no matter how far from from Gloucester, Massachussetts, he must take the boat. Then there's Mark Wahlberg as the younger crewman, who finally is able to make up with his angry wife, Diane Lane, just before departure. Then there are two guys who dislike each other and get into a fist fight at the bar. (Don't worry. One saves the other at sea and they get over their pique. Not that it does them any good.) One of the more attractive things about the film, based as it is (to some extent) on a real story, is that the characters don't have to overcome some exotic threat -- no horde of spiders, no Big Bug, no wanton lion, no flying saucers, no maniacal slasher in a Halloween costume -- just the normal, ordinary, everyday laws of physics. When you join two fluids of different properties together and move one across the other, you get waves. It doesn't matter if the fluids are air vs. air, air vs. water, or oil vs. vinegar.I'm more inclined towards action than the soapy romance of those other two Pictures of the Millennium, but there can be too much of a good thing. I mean, All Adventure, All the Time? I've never seen a perfect storm, although I was on the Carolina coast at the time and watched the wind around the margins clear away everyone's barbecues and dog houses from the back yards. But I can't believe that the lightning in this storm, even at its center, was of such frequency as to provide enough available light for the viewer to see just what was going on. The special effects are very effective but they're excessive too. Wolfgang Peterson was the director and he certainly knows how to handle ships at sea. The way he manages the effects, the acting, and the editing will certainly rattle your chain for you. The constant noise will leave you exhausted. It's a teeth-gnasher if there ever was one.I wish the writer had been equally effective but the truth is that the dialog is kind of sappy and formulaic. Take, for instance, the scene in which Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Linda Greenlaw, visits skipper Clooney in the pilot house the night before he leaves. Why are you risking so much?, she asks, and Clooney launches into this protracted paean to ""the sea"". He stares out at the harbor and tells us what it's like to put out. First you take in the lines, then you pass Cape Sable light, you blow your air horn, then the birds come, first the black backs then the gulls, and you wave to the folks ashore, and you're in charge and the sea is beautiful and the world is at peace and your Krause end bulbs go into overdrive, and so on. Well, I don't believe a word of it. These are hard-working fishermen, experienced, and busting apart with testosterone. No seaman talks like that or even thinks like that, although a screenwriter sitting in his sunshine-flooded living room in Malibu might think he does. The script loved that dumb poetry so much than we hear it again in Clooney's post-mortem voice-over at the very end.There's another problem with the script too. Communications between Linda Greenlaw (who in real life is intelligent and articulate) and the Andrea Gail was lost hours before the boat presumably sank, so the writer is free to invent all sorts of dramatic events, and the dialog to go with them, and director Peterson is at liberty to show them in all their immediacy on the screen. There were times when -- between the constant lightning flashes, the omnipresent crashes of thunder, the frenzied score, the shots whose length could be measured in milliseconds, the shouts of the the distressed crew -- I completely lost track of what was doing what to or with whom. But I was able to get the general idea that if you can think of a cliché about a boat in heavy seas, you can probably find it here. Speaking of clichés, we have flung in our faces a ""grizzled old salt"" who warns of the distant fishing grounds that Clooney is taking his boat to -- ""Plenty fish. Plenty weather."" I forget his name. Maybe Elijah something.I see I've kind of trashed this movie but I don't want to leave too bad an impression of it. It's mostly irritating because it COULD have been so much better if the script had only stuck a little closer to the kinds of interaction we've seen in the introductory scenes. The cast are just about right. Nobody looks glamorous. The faces are genuine -- rude and sturdy. Even Diane Lane isn't glamorized. They're ordinary people coping with ordinary issues. Nice job. Too bad that approach was thrown overboard later.",The Perfect Storm
6,Quinoa1984,Great suspense and drama in rage,9,30 June 2000,"The Perfect Storm is one of the best films of the year (so far), mainly because of it's suspense and drama/action.  This is provided by producer/director Wolfgang Peterson who always brings great entertainment to the screen, and now he has one of his best (right behind Das Boot and Air Force One).  Story follows true account (I know, I saw the real damage 9 years ago) of a fishing boat with a crew (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reiley, William Fichtner) that gets in the middle of the worst storm in history (mainly because it's 3 storms in one).  Great visual effects and suspense with drama on the high seas bring great stuff.  A little sad, but when it's real, it affects people real, like it did me.  The best suspense film of the new year.  Coincidence note- a plane in this movie can be re-fueled in mid air; this was the same in Air Force One except in this film, it re-fuels a coast guard ship.  A+",The Perfect Storm
7,wes-connors,Go Fish,5,24 June 2009,"No argument with the film's description: ""Atlantic swells form 100-foot walls. Wind shrieks at a maxed-out Force 12. In October 1991 three raging weather fronts - one of them Hurricane Grace - combine to form the greatest storm in recorded history. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg lead a talented cast in this harrowing special-effects adventure that intercuts the plight of seafarers struggling to reach safe harbor with the heroics of air/sea rescue crews. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, 'The Perfect Storm' tosses excitement your way in waves."" There is an abundance of stormy special effects, but not enough character development. Mr. Wahlberg gets the best of the lackluster subplots, in romantic scenes with Diane Lane (as Christina Cotter). But, even this is lacking - where'd the black eye come from, anyway, rough sex? The intercutting of characters we know next-to-nothing about (in the other boats and helicopters) is sometimes confusing; and, however exciting, it make no sense because, obviously more time should have been spent showing the six main ""Andrea Gail"" seafarers.***** The Perfect Storm (6/26/00) Wolfgang Petersen ~ George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane",The Perfect Storm
8,michaelRokeefe,When two storms collide.,7,4 August 2000,"Interesting true story with excellent special effects. George Clooney plays the captain of a fishing boat that takes a mostly reluctant crew to catch swordfish in the North Atlantic. The ship finds itself sailing into the convergence of two hellbent storms making into one monster of a storm.Clooney works well with Mark Wahlberg. (The two also starred in THREE KINGS). Also in the cast are Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Diane Lane, Michael Ironside and John C. Reilly.Your popcorn soon starts tasting like fish and you swear an inch of saltwater is in your shoes. Really a dynamic movie. Action, spills and chills. Don't miss out.",The Perfect Storm
9,sunwarrior13,Fishermen In A Disaster Film,9,21 December 2011,"The Perfect Storm is a dramatic disaster film that was an adaptation of the 1997 non-fiction book of the same title by Sebastian Junger.It tells a story about the crew of the Andrea Gail that got caught in the Perfect Storm of 1991. The film stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg together with William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Allen Payne, John Hawkes, Diane Lane, Michael Ironside, Karen Allen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.It was directed Wolfgang Petersen.In October 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne, convinces the Andrea Gail crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. They head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing thunderstorm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck improves. At the height of their fishing the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decide to risk the storm. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimate.After repeated warnings from other ships, the Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing a fellow ship to call in a Mayday. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refuel, the helicopter crew ditch the aircraft before it crashes, and all but one of the crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the Tamaroa. The Andrea Gail endures various problems: with 40-foot waves crashing onto the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship, and two men thrown overboard. The crew decide to turn around to avoid further damage by the storm. After doing so, the vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. Billy tells Bobby to apply full power to ride over the wave; it seems that they may make it over, but the wave starts to plunder and the boat flips over. Billy elects to go down with his ship and only Bobby manages to surface. There are no survivors, however, and the film ends with Captain Greenlaw reading the eulogy at the memorial service, followed by Christina and Bobby's mother, Ethel, consoling each other on the dock and Billy's voice pontificating about what it means to be a sword boat captain.The film has a relatively simple story about dedicated fishermen from Gloucester,MA trying to make a catch that was caught in a disastrous storm.While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, the viewer may get concerned about this film as it suffers from any actual drama or characterization which they believe that is required in any movie.But nevertheless,I still consider it an awfully good film. Although people may dread the experience that these fishermen had,it nevertheless was full of entertainment as for the viewer gets to experience the life of fisherman and the emotions,feelings and aspiration that they go through life.Overall,it is a still a must-see for people wanting to get a view of how life is lived in the sea.",The Perfect Storm

11,hitchcockthelegend,"The Perfect Storm, I just love it so much.,",9,5 February 2011,"The Perfect Storm, I just love it so much. ""The fog's just lifting, you throw off your bow line, you throw off your stern-you head out to South Chanel past Rocky Neck...Ten Pound Island, past Niles Pond where I skated as a kid-and you blow your air horn and throw a wave to the lighthouse keepers kid on Thatcher's Island - then the birds show up, black backs and herring gulls, big dump ducks - the sun hits you, head North, open up to 12, you're steaming now, the guys are busy, you're in charge - you know what? You're a god damn sword boat captain, is there anything better in the world?"" Ordinarily I would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as I can call it, something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. But here with The Perfect Storm I just want to write why I love this particular picture, and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. I'm aware of the complaints about the movie, even the ones from the family of the real Captain Billy Tyne {played by Alpha Male regular George Clooney}, but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude, The Perfect Storm will forever be hitting my spots. The character build up is just wonderful, people with things to prove, fractured and blossoming romances, loyalties on the line, grudges carried over from previous encounters, the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. Then there is a sequence as George Clooney says the monologue that I have opened this review with, beautifully recited, but it's the emotion in Linda Greenlaw's face (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) as she watches and listens to him speak it, just wonderful. Then the boys go out to see, heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market, tensions run high, accidents happen, heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned, but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market, the Grand Banks are evil at this time of year. A three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way, they are, as Linda tells Billy on the radio, heading into the belly of the monster, and what a monster it is. Here the makers excel, director Wolfgang Petersen, his cinematographer John Seale and his S/E maestro John Frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. Then it's the final couple of reels, the emotional mangler, even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less, and I'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go, few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by Mastrantonio here. All of which is backed by a truly involving score by James Horner, shades of Braveheart's emotional swirls in there. It's a personal opinion you know, but The Perfect Storm is a magnificent film that I enjoy three times a year, every year, and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me. ""There's no goodbyes Christina, only love,"" damn straight! 9/10",The Perfect Storm
12,Theo Robertson,I Expected Too Much,5,7 April 2003,"Having the director of DAS BOOT adapt a true story of man versus the cruel sea is a brilliant idea on paper but celluloid it disappoints . I was going to blame the studio for making a film unapologetically commercial with its marketable pop song soundtrack , and its hunky male stars cast to appeal to a female audience along with tedious sub plots featuring wives and children , but seeing as  Wolfgang Petersen also receives a producer`s credit maybe he deserves most of the blame , certainly as director he`s responsible for far too many talkative scenes along with irritating intrusive incidental music , something which also spoiled OUTBREAK . In fact I get the impression Petersen caters far too much towards commercial doctrines in all his American films Wolfgang Petersen gave us DAS BOOT one of the greatest films Europe has ever produced and I don`t think that was a fluke on Petersen`s part . He can make movies involving heart stopping tension and human drama but I think he has a certain misinterpretation how obsessed the Hollywood studio system is with spectacle , star names , sentimentality and special effects . It`s true to a certain degree that`s what Hollywood movies are about , but hopefully one day very soon a prime Hollywood player will tell Petersen he can make a film he wants to make , not one he thinks a  Hollywood studio wants to make",The Perfect Storm
13,preppy-3,Great special effects...,7,24 July 2000,"and little else. I like all the actors in this film and they do the best that they can...it's ALMOST enough. There are two main problems--1) Lousy dialogue--it was so inane and comic strip level...adults don't talk like this--heck, human beings don't talk like this! 2) The accents. It has been proved time and time again you can not imitate a New England accent (I'm from MA so I should know). Unfortunately, some of the cast tries. It sounds funny (people in my audience were giggling) and forced and very very fake. Diane Lane was easily the worst--she's a wonderful actress and it's always good to see her, but she should steer clear of doing accents. At least Mark Wahlberg has the accent anyways, so he sounds fine. Clooney wisely doesn't try.That aside the movie was enjoyable. The acting is good (especially Clooney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and the special effects were superb. The movie really comes to life in the last section when the storm hits. You'll be on the edge of your seat all during those storm sequences. So, if you do see it, try seeing it on a big screen with a good sound system--that's the only way to really enjoy it!",The Perfect Storm
14,dbborroughs,What's the point?,5,15 May 2004,"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FILLEDThe story of a fishing boat that braves one of the worst storms ever recorded is ultimately a pointless waste of film. Like the book it's based on one can admire the detail of what is told but there doesn't seem to be a reason that we are being told it. Perhaps it has to do with the human need to experience and re-experience tragedy that makes us want to hear the story. The trouble is that aside from the the fact that the storm took the lives of everyone on the boat, we don't know what really happened in the final minutes. Its all spectacularly recounted on the screen and its a wonderfully frightening experience, but like the book its based on I left the film feeling ghoulish and empty, since I knew what what was going to happen, I just was waiting  for it to occur. With out a context the film falls flat, there is no ""why is this story important"". Worse is the fact that the events depicted are not normal, so while fishing is a low paid and dangerous way to make a living, what happened is not what they face every day. (Of course the fact these are not the most charming people doesn't make it easier to watch)Ultimately this is a technically perfect film that is the cinematic equivalent of a snuff film, the only difference is that this only dramatizes events. 5 out of 10, solely for the film making.This is a morbid and soulless film",The Perfect Storm

It is the special effects, sound, and stunt work that characterize it.Sure, it has George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C.

16,zardoz-13,"Don't Get Caught in ""The Perfect Storm""",1,20 March 2008,"The ship takes too long to sink in ""Das Boot"" director Wolfgang Petersen's ""The Perfect Storm,"" a mediocre cinematic adaptation of Sebastian Junger's bestselling sea-faring yarn about an ill-fated fishing foray into the tempest-torn Atlantic Ocean. As a sincere but superficial tribute to all Gloucester, Massachusetts' fishermen that have perished in the sea, ""The Perfect Storm"" stirs up more tear-jerking, soap operatic sentimentality than it does meteorological menace. Despite its briny documentary realism, an ensemble cast of ship-shape stars, and a seaworthy raft of Industrial Light & Magic computer generated special effects, this Warner Brothers release about men against the sea charts too many courses, contains too many irrelevant characters that win minimal sympathy, and gives its monstrous gale-force weather systems the short shrift.Imagine a soggy synthesis of John Sturges' ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" Ronald Neame's ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" and the Yul Brynner air/sea rescue epic ""Flight from Ashiya,"" and you have the basics of Bill (""Legends of the Fall"") Wittliff's improbable, uneven, and convoluted screenplay. First, based as it is on an actual event, ""Storm"" tries to cover two stories at once but does justice to neither one. Director Wolfgang Petersen cross-cuts erratically between the swordboat fishermen and a pleasure craft cruising sailboat captain with two female mates. Second, Petersen and Wittliff concern themselves with a far larger number of characters than they can develop beyond the usual stereotypes. Indeed, while they go to outlandish lengths to flesh out and humanize the fishermen, the filmmakers neglect to sketch in details about either the sailboat characters or the Air National Guardsman helicopter crew. Finally, despite its title, ""The Perfect Storm"" emerges as far from perfect. Petersen and Wittliff wring little more than a splash of suspense from the inclement weather in this waterlogged maritime melodrama. The scenes featuring a New England weatherman who rhapsodizes about 'the storm of a lifetime' could have been left on the cutting room floor as could the parallel story about the sailboat survivors. Undeniably, the characters attain greater significance than the raging storm that engulfs them. Clearly, Petersen and Wittliff found it easier to dramatize the more tangible human elements rather than the intangible weather phenomenon that Junger described with a bounty of scientific detail.Initially, ""Storm"" focuses on New England fishermen, principally Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney of ""Three Kings"") and the ragtag crew of the Andrea Gail, a 72-foot swordfishing boat. This salty saga unfolds in the fall of 1991 after Tyne has just gotten back from fishing on the Grand Banks with a less than spectacular haul of swordfish. Inexplicably, unlike fellow fisherman Captain Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio of ""The Abyss""), Billy cannot seem to find the fish. Tyne's run of bad luck irks his crew, especially rookie sailor Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg of ""Shooter"") and veteran angler Murph (John C. Reilly of ""Magnolia"") who had counted on fatter paychecks. Bobby wants to marry his divorced girlfriend, Christina Cotter (Diane Lane of ""Untraceable""), but they are financially strapped and need every cent so they can move out of their room at a local wharf-side tavern into a place of their own. Meanwhile, Murph has just divorced his wife, and she is relying on his checks, too. The greedy owner of the Andrea Gail, Bob Brown (the ever cynical Michael Ironsides of ""Starship Troopers""), warns Tyne that if his luck doesn't improve, Brown will make him walk the plank. If there were ever a ""Blue Collar"" version of ""Captains Courageous,"" ""The Perfect Storm"" is it! Tyne chaffs because Greenlaw has caught twice as much swordfish. The issue of catching enough fish to make it worthwhile for his crew to ship out with him obsesses Tyne. Moreover, Billy fears that his professional reputation has been harpooned, and he feels compelled to deliver no matter what the cost or the consequences. All the guys in ""Storm"" tangle with too much testosterone and wind up acting like mini-minded morons.Against Greenlaw's better advice as well as one of his crew who refuses to weigh anchor with him again, the guilt-ridden but reckless Tyne launches one last voyage to make up for their minuscule catch. Bobby, Murph, Bugsy (John Hawkes), and Jamaican ladies' man Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne) sign on for one more trip. Tyne replaces his missing crew member with David 'Sully' Sullivan (William Fichtner of ""Armageddon""), then learns that Murph and Sully hate each other. Nevertheless, although he has picked a dangerous time of the year with the threat of hurricanes looming on the horizon, Tyne plans to ply the far-off but fabled waters of the Flemish Cap where he claims they will find the catch that will 'set the market.' Meanwhile, vigilant Boston TV weatherman Todd Gross (Christopher MacDonald of ""The Skulls"") tracks three storms about to converge offshore in 'the storm of the century.' Before our heroes cast off, Petersen and Wittliff foreshadow the dire straits that lie ahead for them. All the women, from Bobby's mom to Captain Greenlaw, behave like the mythical Cassandra. Bobby's mom warns that ""The Grand Banks are no joke in October."" Comparably, Christina begs her boyfriend, ""Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feelin'."" While Petersen treads water in familiar territory, he achieves none of the success that highlighted his U-boat classic ""Das Boot."" The action occurs either on the turbulent high seas or in the calm harbor. Interestingly, ""Storm"" and ""Boot"" start similarly as the mariners return to port and indulge in a subsequent drunken binge. Effectively, Petersen steeps audiences in the environment and the economics of the Gloucester fishermen and the ominous sense of dread that hovers over the townspeople when Tyne and his crew head out to sea. Ultimately, instead of a death-defying melodrama of men against the sea, ""The Perfect Storm"" turns into a moribund memorial service that leaves you with a sinking feeling.",The Perfect Storm
17,view_and_review,Deadliest Catch,7,17 June 2008,"It is amazing how movies about death and destruction are usually the best movies, or at least the highest grossing: Titanic, Independence Day, et al. Perhaps because in the face of peril there is usually one who proves heroic. The Perfect Storm is no different. You had regular people living their regular lives and they intentionally put themselves in harms way just to earn a better living. Ordinarily we would say that is a stupid move and they got exactly what was coming to them for rolling the dice with their lives. But how can you blame a group of men who only want to better their bad situation? Maybe this movie isn't half as good if the fishermen were criminals or thieves making the trek for something illegal. Because these were ordinary men whom we came to know (with the exception of the black guy played by a rather known actor (Allen Payne), he didn't have a single line) we could love the story and love the movie. And the movie did have a hero of sorts in Capt. Billy Tyne (George Clooney). He encouraged Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) and even helped him to live even though all of their fates were sealed.",The Perfect Storm
18,Uriah43,The Perils of Deep Sea Fishing,7,29 September 2019,"This film begins in the autumn of 1991 with two fishing boats motoring in to the harbor of Gloucester, Massachusetts. One of these boats is loaded with swordfish while the other is sadly lacking in that department. Although the captain of the second boat, ""Billy Tyne"" (George Clooney) is a skilled and seasoned fisherman, even he admits that he has been on a cold streak as of late and this, quite naturally, has the owner of the boat by the name of ""Bob Brown"" (Michael Ironside) extremely upset. That being said, realizing that there are others dependent upon him, Billy becomes determined to to set out again. And after much thought most of the members of his crew agree even though they understand that the weather may not be conducive for another attempt. And to make matters even worse, when they get to their first fishing spot the catch is woefully inadequate and rather than turning back almost empty-handed Billy decides to venture out even further to a lucrative-but exceedingly dangerous-area known as the Flemish Cap. What he doesn't realize is that a hurricane has formed near Bermuda and is heading directly for them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exciting adventure film which combines solid acting and good character development. I especially liked the performances of Diane Lane (as ""Christina Cotter"") and the aforementioned George Clooney who played their roles exceedingly well. That being said, I recommend this film to those who might be interested in a movie of this sort and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Perfect Storm

It is difficult to believe he directed both movies.  The storm delivers 'perfectly'amazing movie effects, but it is not enough to compensate for the sloppiness in the script.  We are presumed to be truly interested in the personal side of the fishermen and the townspeople after merely receiving rudimentary introductions.  One character's inability to remember the name of a new acquaintance is perfect allegory for the audiences (lack of)interest in the town folk characters. Regrettably, we are left to wonder if a story following the story of Diane Lane or Marky Mark's mother might hold more intrigue than the completed film.  The Coast Guard scenes are sometimes spectacular, although again, seem totally disengaged from the rest of the film.  There are a couple of very nice supporting roles in the film; however, I found myself chuckling at Karen Allen's role.  Most of her (few)lines are left inaudible due to the dramatic effects of the storm.  Both George Clooney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are beautiful, tanned people, yet unbelievable as captains - at home only on the sea. If you are looking for special effects, this is your movie.

It's kind of like ""Armageddon,"" except they died saving the world, these guys died to bring home some fish. Yes ""Armageddon"" is fictional, but if the entire crew died so is the majority of this. Why's the film a tribute? It's not like they couldn't avoid it, their loyalties to the captain and his recklessness meant their fate. They died for nothing, but one man's foolish quest or pride. Billy has no redeeming qualities and whether it's factually accurate or not, it's a rather hateful film towards him and his family.

21,anaconda-40658,The Perfect Sh*t Storm.,2,13 July 2015,"The Perfect Storm (2000): Dir: Wolfgang Petersen / Cast: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane, William Fichtner: Disaster film that rides viewers through two hours of storms, winds and swordfish to reveal an ending that had me wanting to give it away to those awaiting to rip themselves off. Based on a true story with a storm that is beyond perfect. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and a host of other fishermen journey to the Atlantic to catch fish but upon their way back they are caught within a massive storm. Cliché filled bore directed by Wolfgang Petersen who previously made another laugh rendered action farce called Air Force One. Terrific special effects are only plus but the cast basically sleepwalk through the entire film. Clooney, Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, and Diane Lane are at the mercy of special effects and none of it is very remarkable. There is a vague subplot that involves William Fichtner as a former lover to the John C. Reilly character's wife but it really doesn't matter. This film exists purely for its production values despite its ad campaign boasting its true story bases. It is nearly two hours of torture watching these fisherman meet their death. What is the sense in that? All this work within a screenplay that isn't worth a dime of it. The best way to deal with a film of this disappointing nature is to flush it down the toilet so that it may ride the waves it deserves. Score: 2 / 10",The Perfect Storm
22,Aaron1375,"Not that perfect a storm, it apparently only took out one fishing boat and some idiots on a sailboat.",4,24 January 2010,"I will never understand how this movie made more at the box office than the Mel Gibson revolutionary war movie ""The Patriot"" did. Both opened the same day, however ""The Perfect Storm"" out performed it that weekend and did more in its total box office. I guess that whole poster and trailer showing the wave worked, but considering that made up like one percent of the total movie it makes little sense how the more complete movie ""The Patriot"" did less. However, this dislike for this movie may stem less from the movie being actually bad and more from the fact I am not the biggest Mark Walhberg fan. Yet, I somehow keep going to his movies again and again and being disappointed. Go figure, I think I learned my lesson after ""Max Payne"". I am also not a George Clooney fan either, but I never really go see his movies, this and ""Batman and Robin"" or the only two of his films I have watched. This one centers around some fisherman going through a dry spell on catching swordfish. Well the captain (Clooney) thinks he knows where he and his crew can get a big score so off they go to pad a movie that should have been an hour and a half long to an over two hour movie and they kept the focus so narrow. Granted the ship out on sea and the coast guard happened that night, but they really do not go into anymore than that when doing their storm. Makes it look like all that happened was one ship and one sailboat were affected and I am sure that was not the case. To much fisherman fishing for my tastes. If you are going to have this movie be as long as it was then expand the scope and show what other damages the storm did and the effects of the storm on other people.

On the negative side, the film contains about the most generic and stock characters and situations one will find in Hollywood. The actors in this film, most of whom are normally great, obviously did this just for the big pay check so that they could star in more Magnolias and Three Kings. But on the positive side, it contains some extremely exciting and physically harrowing scenes. From a technical point of view, it might be the most well done sea disaster film ever made. Whatever happens, don't decide to wait for video to see this film. Even on DVD, it would not be very fun to watch. These waves simply have to be over your head to enjoy this film. See it at a matinee. I paid $3.50 to see it, and I'm perfectly happy about that price. And after you watch it, if you do think it's something great, go out and rent _The Poseidon Adventure_, which, while the special effects don't reach anywhere near this level, I feel is the best disaster movie I've ever seen.

When will they get back on the I was thinking after about 5 minutes to much about there sex lives, girl friends, and talking.  When they get back on the boat the film picks up, and the interest of them getting a good catch, along with the riggers of job.    The best part of the movie, and what I spent the money for is when the storm starts.  It's a story like Jack Londons ""To build a Fire"" will they survive, and over come the natural problems nature throws at them?  Will the rescue team arrive in time?  What makes this film interesting is they turn the boat around and try to save there lives.  Like Jack Londons to build a fire, they die in the ending, and its a good change from by the numbers hollywood endings, this adds realism.  They tie the ending up nicely with a wall where the history of fisher men lost to the sea honors them, and shows there a part in history.

There are great scenes in the local bar where everyone gets together and cries in their beer with straight SHOTS of BOOZE! There is constant fear of the Sea and many women constantly worrying about their husbands or boyfriends. This was a very well produced film which captures the horrors of what the Atlantic OCEAN can produce when violent storms visit the EAST COAST fishing ports!

26,JamesHitchcock,"Not quite the perfect film, but nevertheless a pretty good one",8,18 December 2008,"Like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Titanic"", ""The Perfect Storm"" is a disaster movie about the loss of a ship at sea. (The director, Wolfgang Petersen, was later to make ""Poseidon"", a remake of the original ""Poseidon Adventure""). Whereas those films dealt with ocean-going liners, however, the ship involved here is a small fishing vessel, the Andrea Gail, sailing out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. The film is based upon the book of the same name by Sebastian Junger, which was in turn based upon the true events of the ""Halloween Nor'easter"", a storm which hit the coasts of New England and eastern Canada in October and November 1991.The film follows the characteristic two-act structure common to many disaster movies. (""Dante's Peak"" and ""Titanic"" itself are other examples). In Act I we are introduced to a select group of characters with whom we can identify. Act II deals with the disaster itself, the main source of drama being whether or not those characters will be able to escape with their lives. In this case, of course, the select group is the crew of the Andrea Gail- the captain Billy Tyne, the young, inexperienced Bobby Shatford, divorcée Dale ""Murph"" Murphy, David ""Sully"" Sullivan, who has a long history of antagonism with Murph, Michael ""Bugsy"" Moran and the quiet Alfred Pierre, the only black member of the crew. We also get to meet some of their friends and relatives, including Shatford's girlfriend Chris, his mother Ethel, Bugsy's girlfriend Irene and Linda Greenlaw, the female captain of another fishing vessel.Many disaster movies, going back at least as far as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Jaws"" in the mid-seventies, have a simplistic morality; the disaster should be seen to be caused, or at least exacerbated, by human incompetence, complacency or greed. (In ""Titanic"", for example, the collision with the iceberg occurs because the ship's owners, for commercial reasons, have ordered the captain to steam at full speed through the ice-field.) In ""The Perfect Storm"" matters are not so simple. The disaster which strikes the Andrea Gail is not due to the folly or wickedness of any one individual but rather the result of a complicated interplay of various economic and psychological factors, as well as a combination of meteorological ones which give rise to a storm of unusual ferocity. (One meteorologist described them to Junger as the ""perfect conditions"" for a storm- hence the title of his book).In the opening scenes the Andrea Gail returns to Gloucester with a poor catch. Desperate for money, and under pressure from the boat's owner, Tyne persuades his reluctant crew to join him for one further voyage, the last of the season. They head further out to sea than normal, heading for the Flemish Cap rather than the Grand Banks. They have great success at the Cap, but when their refrigerator breaks, Tyne and his crew face a dilemma. Do they hurry back home, and brave the storm which is developing closer to land, or do they wait out at sea for the storm to abate, which will mean losing their catch? Of course, they choose the former option (there wouldn't have been a film if they had chosen the latter one) and the rest of the film deals with their battle against the powerful winds and monstrous waves. There is also a sub-plot about the Mistral, a yacht caught in the same storm, and the efforts of the Coastguard to rescue its crew.""The Perfect Storm"" is not quite the perfect film, but it is nevertheless a pretty good one. It missed out on a ""Best Picture"" Oscar nomination, although in my view it deserved one far more than the ghastly ""Chocolat"", but was deservedly nominated in the ""Best Effects, Visual Effects"" category. This is not, however, a film which relies exclusively on special effects, good though those effects are. The human factor is also important, as all the crew become individuals we can identify and sympathise with; there are a couple of good contributions from George Clooney as Tyne and Mark Wahlberg as Shatford. This is one of the best disaster movies of recent years, better than ""Dante's Peak"", in which the characters were less well developed, and on a par with ""Titanic"". Although ""The Perfect Storm"" lacks the grandeur and epic scale of the earlier film, it has a more intimate, human feel to it and an equally moving conclusion. 8/10",The Perfect Storm
27,StevePulaski,"Quick, evocative, and effectively entertaining",8,20 August 2012,"If there's one thing we're sure of by the end of The Perfect Storm it is that director Wolfgang Petersen can hurl shot after shot of currents ripping through a ship and still maintain capable control of the film's coherency and that perfect storms are not something to joke about.This is a disaster film where fun is not disregarded and neither are the characters or the story's progression. The film's ultimate goal is one I can recognize; showcasing rather two-dimensional characters in a plot surrounding an enormous storm that engulfed the east coast and created millions of dollars in restitution payments and to showcase the storm itself. It succeeds in both. This is nowhere near a fleshed-out film, but it isn't a ho-hum Michael Bay extravaganza, where faint archetypes take the stage instead of compelling characters. This is a rare occurrence where even though we do not know a whole lot about these characters, we come to sympathize with them in the final act for reasons we can not totally explain. Perhaps their personalities, or maybe their innocence, has grabbed onto us.The film focuses on the storm of October 1991, where a nor'easter was absorbed by Hurricane Grace to create one of the most violent and unforgiving storms in history. We center around a swordfishing team who drive a boat named the ""Andrea Gail"" in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Captained by Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and made up of members Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), and Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), the boat has continuously brought in a miniscule amount of fish, resulting in very low pay among the crewmembers.They sail out past their usual turf, with an unmaintainable, unpredictable storm is brewing in the back of them. When they decide to travel all the way to ""Flemish Cap,"" an even further location, they wind up catching, literally, a boatload of fish, but with a broken ice-machine, they must hurry back before the catch spoils. Waiting would result in a wasted trip, so by the crew's unanimous agreement, they push on through the treacherous waters, fifty foot waves, unforgivable currents, and constant rainfall to bring the town of Gloucester their catch.Astraphobics and Lilapsophobics be forewarned; this film is relentless in its depiction of brutal weather. Shots of currents consuming the ""Andrea Gail"" are not uncommon, nor are underwater sequences which are expertly directed and choreographed. Petersen never seems to lose control of this monumental picture, despite filming it on such a large grid. His direction never once becomes sterile or anemic, and it seems that with Das Boot, The Perfect Storm, and the recent Poseidon remake under his belt, he has a more confident feeling underwater than on the surface.When The Perfect Storm deals with the troubles on surface it does not try to undermine them. It shows contentions crewmates had with each other, the restlessness of going out against better judgment, and the idea of the possible loss of loved ones. Writers Bo Goldman and William D. Wittliff unfortunately tuck deeper characteristics away, but a deep character study shouldn't be expected when we have a film centered around a colossal disaster. We get solid, fleshed-out characters and that is enough.The true shine is watching elaborate shots of remarkable special effects take center stage to create a grimly realistic setting of the ocean at its worst. The scene which has been used as the film's main theatrical poster is truly a sight to behold. It's remarkable how scene after scene of The Perfect Storm isn't taken with incredulity or a bent reality. It isn't as narrow-minded or as hackneyed as its premise would expect. It isn't typical Hollywood-driven disaster schlock. It's quick, evocative, and effectively entertaining.Starring: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, John C.

30,sddavis63,The Storm Is The Star Of This Superb Movie,9,1 November 2012,"The fact that I give such high rating to this movie is worth noting, for the simple reason that it stars George Clooney, and in all honesty, I'm not much of George Clooney fan. Most of his movies I haven't cared for, and most of his performances I've found rather dry and lifeless. Neither of those criticisms can be levelled at ""A Perfect Storm,"" however. This is a fantastic movie. It's exciting, the effects are fantastic, the killer storm is portrayed vividly and realistically. It's made more gut wrenching by the fact that it's based on a true story (the Andrea Gail and its crew were in fact lost during a huge monster storm in 1991) and while no one can know exactly what happened on board the ship in its last hours before sinking, the story as depicted is entirely believable. I can't believe much could have been done to have made this better.Clooney plays Billy Tyne - captain of the Andrea Gail. Going far out into the Atlantic to try to make up for a poor season, Tyne, his ship and his crew get caught in a covergence of storms that literally create a monster. While most of the movie depicts the Andrea Gail, it's equally tense watching a small private yacht get caught in the storm, watching a coast guard cutter and helicopter try to rescue the yacht's crew and watching as the families of the Andrea Gail's crew await news. The opening half hour or so of the movie is a bit slow paced and is used to provide background on the various crew members. But the time spent on that isn't wasted. We see the Andrea Gail's crew as real people because of that, with friends and wives and children waiting for them, and, knowing what their fate will be, there's a sense of heaviness as you watch them say good bye as they head off on what will be their last voyage.In a way it's the storm, far more than Clooney, that's the star of this movie. It's frighteningly depicted. Clooney is balanced by a good supporting cast, including people like Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly. While Clooney is the obvious lead, there's very much an ensemble feel to this, especially among the cast who play the Andrea Gail's crew. This truly is a superb movie. (9/10)",The Perfect Storm
31,cherold,Why on earth was this made,3,28 April 2001,"When I see a movie ""based on a true story,"" I expect that story to be somehow remarkable.  A story of a man who jumps off a 100 story building and lives is remarkable, a story where he dies, however, is not, something that the makers of The Perfect Storm failed to realize.  Not only is the story unremarkable, but everything leading up to and following the storm is painfully tedious.  There is a tradition in Hollywood of action films with tedious soap opera lead ins (The Birds, Jurasaic Park) and it's always a serious mistake.  Every filmmaker should ask themselves: If the action scenes weren't in this movie and it was all about story and character, would a single living human being on the planet be willing to sit through it?

""No, it's my life!"").  But Ron Howard's film scored on two points: its foundation on known facts, and the feats of ingenuity (as well as courage) that helped save the crew.  ""The Perfect Storm"" has neither of these advantages.  James Horner's score is stirring but tells you exactly what to think at every moment, while laid-back George Clooney is a fish out of water as the boat's captain, he plays the role as an uncomplicated, and uninteresting, hero.

35,ironhorse_iv,"Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain. The Perfect Storm kinda does that. Come onboard, the Andrea Gail!",7,16 August 2014,"The Perfect Storm is no way a perfect movie. It's a biographical disaster drama with a predictable downer ending, but you see, how much, these men were so driven as fishermen. I think, that's the best part about the movie. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the movie is an adaptation of the 1997 non-fiction book of the same title by Sebastian Junger about the crew of the Andrea Gail, a swordfish boat that got caught in the middle of the Perfect Storm of 1991. The movie is very moving and edge-of-your-seat experiences. The movie is full of great actors putting their all into this film with their acting. You really get to see the chemistry between the Captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his supporting cast of fishermen. George Clooney is believable, and you can honestly, see him in this lead role. He really give some great talk interaction with both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Mark Wahlberg's characters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is just awful, her accent will guaranteed to make viewers from Massachusetts cringe. Likewise, the relationship between Tyne and Linda Greenlaw was fictitious. Tyne and Greenlaw were barely acquainted in real life. While, it's clear that George Clooney is stirring the ship as the on screen lead. It's in fact, Mark Wahlberg whom get most of the screen time as Robert ""Bobby"" Shatford. The movie focus on his love-affair with Christina ""Chris"" Cotter (Diane Lane) more than anything in the film. Because of this, we rarely know anything much about the others crew, besides a few details just there to pull heart strings. Dale ""Murph"" Murphy (John C. Reilly) is a veteran fisherman whom divorced with a son with whom he's very involved in. Murph also has rocky relationship with crewmember David ""Sully"" Sullivan (William Fichtner) for odd reason, never explain in the film. They really make Sully look like hothead, and it's sucks that he don't know, anything about him, besides that. Then, there is Michael ""Bugsy"" Moran (John Hawkes), a member of the Andrea Gail crew, whom all we know about him is that he fix the ice machine, and can't find dates with women. The worst coverage has to be Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), he don't know, anything about him besides that he can't speak English, very well. Honestly, his character was really just demoted to an extra. One of the biggest faults of the film is that the film focus way too much on the sub-plot rescue missions on a down Air National Guard rescue helicopter and the sailboat Satori with characters, we barely know about. The movie shows only have focus on the events that the Andrea Gail was going through. It felt like, I was watching two different movies trying to act like one. Don't get me wrong, the Satori and the helicopter mission was interesting, but I think, the reason, most people came to see this movie was to hear the story of what happen to the Andrea Gail. It felt like it was just running the run time. Some critics had a problem with the authenticity, that the movie change a lot of what really happen. They even add some action scenes to the film, such in the case of the shark, and the hook. Most names were not changed for the fictional film, and some families of certain crew members of the Andrea Gail sued the producers because of that, and that their names were used without their permission. The movie depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous, which is up to air, but also makes them look very foolish. No wonder, why the victim family didn't like it. The movie really did have some of the best special effects at the time. It was pretty impression to watch. For a PG-13, the film does have a lot of man Vs Nature action scenes that was scary to watch, because you know it could happen. Parents need to know that this movie has some strong sailor language and some sexual references that can get crude. For most parents, the primary concern will be the sadness of the movie. Like, I said, it's a downer movie. It's not really much of a spoiler, since the movie opens with foreshadowing. The first scene of the movie shows the wall listing the fisherman lost at sea throughout the centuries after all. Even the trailer kinda spoil it. It's a tear jerking man movie, so make sure, you bring your tissue paper when watching this. Another great high light of the film is the music. James Horner is like Hans Zimmer and Danny Eflman; they all recycle old themes of theirs and they never compose a truly 'Original' Score, but every score they do compose is always phenomenal to hear, either way. This is one of those. It's just beautiful to listen to. 'Yours Forever' written by James Horner and performed by John Mellencamp is just amazing. It's one of my favorite songs on my IPOD playlist. Overall: It's an intense, real and emotional experience that just has to be watch to understand. Despite some faults, Perfect Storm is still one of my favorite movies of the early 2000s.",The Perfect Storm

It's a cinematic approach to the dangers of Grand Banks fishermen's face in real life. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, has screenplay by William D. Wittliff, based on the book by Sebastian Junger. The cast is headed by George Clooney (in the role of Billy Tyne, master of the fishing vessel) and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (in the role of Linda Greenlaw, captain of another ship), but also has other very talented actors like Bob Gunton, William Fichtner, John C. Reilly, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.Since the beginning of time that the sailors and fishermen were subject to the dangers of sea and storms. This film talks about it, and a particular case that led to the loss of several lives when a storm of rare proportions explodes on the waters off of Gloucester, US. The script is well written and the story is touching. The sets and photography are blameless and the visual and sound effects are excellent, especially portraying the storm (indeed deserved the Oscar nomination precisely for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects). George Clooney was wonderfully in his role, giving him a huge personality, an old sailor soul who loves the sea, even with all the dangers of it. The cast, however, was all at a great level and manages to capture the sympathy of the audience, who suffers with them and go with them to the sea, eager to return to earth and get away from that cruel and rough waters.Although this movie has passed quietly and still be a film that is not much remembered, its an excellent disaster film (much better than others, showing disasters that never happen) that deals with facts that cost the lives of hundreds of fishermen and sailors every year. So, apart from a great movie, it's a beautiful tribute to these men and their families.",The Perfect Storm
39,TheMovieDiorama,The Perfect Storm casts an impressive hurricane that dampens its fishing crew.,5,16 March 2020,"Hurricane Grace, a Category-2 tropical cyclone, enveloped Bermuda and its surrounding fishing waters. By any definition, Grace was a standard short-lived hurricane. It did however become absorbed by a developing extratropical storm, low-pressure areas that essentially power the weather globally. The two combining created, what is now classed as, the ""Perfect Storm of 1991"". A catastrophic natural coincidence that inflicted much economic damage to the US and its fisheries, costing over two hundred million dollars and rallying a death toll of thirteen. A substantial enough impact for Junger to write a novel about the unfortunate events of the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat that was stuck at the Flemish Cap as the hurricane approached. A courageous crew, with a captain brimming with self-determination to finally catch a plethora of fish, risking their lives for money.Petersen's summer blockbuster adaptation, is very much that. A disaster film that unsurprisingly places exceedingly high production design and special effects above succinct characterisation and drama. For the uninitiated, this may prove to be a fruitful distraction. The vastness of the Atlantic Ocean, the perilous winds and colossal waves battering the Andrea Gail. The visual aesthetic, along with Seale's cinematography, were noteworthy benchmarks for the industry. The blustery meteorological environment, comprising of torrential downpour and strikes of lightning, exhibiting technical excellence when conveying the chaotic need for survival. The meticulous authenticity to the methods fisheries utilise, particularly the buoys, aided in bringing life to an industry that is rarely shown on film. Despite my personal reservations for fishing, it is a way of life for many port communities. Gloucester, Massachusetts, clearly relying on this industry to sustain, and Wittliff's script details the closeness of this community. The attempt at involving loved ones left behind to witness the storm, as they watch the news in hope to listen out for the Andrea Gail's whereabouts.Sadly, this fishing boat and its crew members rarely come to life. The characters themselves were bland and forgettable, equipped with an unnecessary feud between Sully and Murph which denotes no value other than to save each other when the plot requires it. The blossoming romance between Bobby and, the seemingly older, Chris was only used to create a monotonous conflict between commercial fishing and love, exhibiting minimal chemistry. Yet the biggest issue is with the portrayal of Billy, whom apparently made the conscious decision to risk the lives of his crew, as agreed with them, by sailing through the dangerous storm for the sake of potential income.According to Captain Greenlaw, whom also was depicted in the film and had strong reservations with many narrative choices that did not actually happen, the storm rampantly hit the Andrea Gail on their way home. There was no decision to be made. It ultimately shows a lack of respect for the characters, and unassumingly alters the ""drama"" for limited depth, making room for the special effects to take centre stage. Then there's the tedious distraction of the Air National Guards rescuing another sea vessel, whilst also spending half the feature's runtime rescuing themselves and tarnishing a multi-million dollar helicopter to earnestly illustrate heart over intelligence. Again, cementing this notion of sub-standard storytelling for extreme production values.The Perfect Storm is far from perfect, and unsurprisingly drowns itself in technical transformation. Each wave that crashes the Andrea Gail excites with its pounding sound effects and resounding hopelessness. Yet consequently washes away vital character development and realistic drama needed to turn this into a Category-5 blockbuster.",The Perfect Storm

41,Anonymous_Maxine,"This film's main redeeming value was the fact that it was based on a true story, and it vaguely communicated the events of that story. However, it was also badly distorted by the influences of Hollywood.",5,20 August 2000,"The Perfect Storm is an extremely difficult kind of film to make. No matter how you approach it, the budget is going to have to be huge, and there will definitely be some scenes that will simply be impossible to film on location. Hence, special effects are necessary. Given that, even though I generally feel that less is more as far as special effects, I respect the extensive use of special effects in this film. Without computer generated images, this film would never have been made. However, it should be noted that the convenience of special effects led to a high degree of questionable and, at some points, laughable excesses which were portrayed on the screen during The Perfect Storm. It was hard enough for me that every single external shot was obviously computer generated, but then the activities of the waves themselves during the storm were exaggerated to ridiculous proportions. First, yes there are waves that get that big and much bigger every day in the open ocean, but they are also several miles long. The constant straight up and straight down of the waves in the film is simply not true. However, when these waves collide, they do create very tall and very steep waves called 'rogue' waves, as they were called in the film, but these were pretty much the only kind of waves ever shown in the whole movie. Obviously they are more dramatic to watch, but they are not a continually occurring phenomenon. Even worse, I noticed a few scenes where obscenely huge waves (it is physically impossible for open ocean waves to be that big without a tremendous force like an earthquake, by the way) were shown completely motionless for seconds at a time. It was like the wave was some huge solid form just under the surface, and the water was just running over it. And then there was the wave that broke and toppled the Andrea Gail over longways (yes, I'm talking about the wave that George Clooney was screaming at). Waves just do not break like that in the open ocean, especially not waves as tremendous as that one. Basically, the storm scenes were simply exploded to impossibly huge proportions, which was one of the many ways that Hollywood manipulated this film.The other major problem concerned some of the things that were added into the story to make the film easier for a mass audience. (spoilers) This is not a happily-ever-after film, it's a true story. Everyone dies. So what they did was they had things like Bobby Shatford's (Mark Wahlberg) monologue to his distant future wife (""...it's only love...""), and of COURSE, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) deliberately allows himself to be taken down with the ship. How perfect. I'm not saying this didn't happen, maybe Tyne really went down as the traditional captain should, and maybe Shatford really did attempt a bit of telecommunication, but that is irrelevent. The point is that we don't know what happened, everything that you see in the second half of this film is pure speculation, and it is heavily sugar-coated, which bothers me. They even went to the extent of portraying the characters as though fishing was something that they needed just as much as food or water. Remember the scene when Cpt. Tyne says ""Let's go fishing"" as they are beginning their final fishing trip? All of the guys get so excited that you would think they'd just heard that they won some kind of world sword-fishing championship. That scene, by the way, establishes the ""they died doing what they loved"" layer of sugar-coating. How sweet.I'll be the first to honor the reality of the tragedy portrayed in The Perfect Storm. In fact, the one Coast Guard paramedic that died in the rescue attempt, whose real name was Rick Smith, was a close friend of my father's the year before this mission took place. They worked together in the National Guard for years, they even shared a desk. When they were moved, my father was stationed in California and Smith was stationed on the east coast,  where he soon received his fateful assignment. If it had been the other way around, it could easily have been someone portraying my father in this film. Clearly, I have a bit of an emotional bias toward this film, but I think that it was a little too excessive, particularly in the special effects department and the Hollywood sugar-coating. It's a great story and an entertaining movie, but I just don't think that it needed to be blown up that big in order to adequately portray the events that took place in the Pacific that year.",The Perfect Storm
42,dfranzen70,Yo ho ho and a kettle of fish,7,13 July 2000,"Sure, I know what you're thinking. George Clooney being a manly man, gritting his pearly whites and saving lives. Hey, this ain't E.R, folks. This is a real-life action drama.You may have heard of the ""Storm of the Century"" that smacked into New England in 1991. You might also have heard of the Andrea Gail, a small fishing boat caught smack dab in the middle of it. Of course, you might also have watched the documentary on MSNBC before this movie aired, and therefore you know the ending anyway. Luckily for me, I kept myself ignorant (a planned action, I assure you!), and had no idea what the end result was for this movie. And no, I'm not going to tell you the ending. Sure, I know, it's not exactly a twist ending, and you could find out on your own if you wanted. So go ahead, find out. We critics don't give away endings. It's part of the Critics Society secret waiver we signed.Anyway, here's the tale in a nutshell. Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a grizzled fishing-boat captain who pilots the Andrea Gail, owned by Bob Brown (Michael Ironside). Seems Billy's had a run of bad luck lately, and when he and rival fisherman Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, not too far from ""The Abyss"") return from a run, he's the one with the lesser load. Gritting those teeth and raising a fist, Billy returns to the deep a scant two days after leaving it, determined to find some damn fish.His plan is to go further than usual. I'm no cartographer, but I can tell you his plan was to go a ways, then go further than that, because that's where the fish are, by gum. So our old salt rallies his crew together, and off they go. And fish they catch! Big ones, and of course there's the requisite crewmen-who-don't-like-each-other, and a nasty old shark, and all sorts of hilarious hijinks, just the sort of stuff you'd expect to see (no pun intended) in a movie about deep-sea fishing.So they have the fish, and they're heading back home, and they're so damn happy, and WHAM! They find out they're heading into a big ol' horkin' storm. You've seen the commercials - this is what it's all leading up to. So they have a choice - turn around and go the long way (and lose their fish, which would spoil) or go through that nasty old storm? Guess which one Billy wants to do.Among the other cast members, Mark Wahlberg does a solid, commanding job as greenhorn Bobby Shatford and John C. Reilly is a treat as veteran sailor Murph. Karen Allen and Diane Lane are relegated to small, thankfless roles.Ar, ar, me hearties! Batten down yer masts! See Clooney rage madly at the storm like King Lear! Hey, look, folks, it's simple. You wanna see George Clooney be a tough guy? Here's your movie. You want a story and believable characters? Go see Yentl. I almost thought the sea was full of testosterone, since these guys seemed to be swimming in it. So pack up your grunts and belches, and have a blast with this escapist movie!",The Perfect Storm
43,ianlouisiana,Hollywood trivialises a tragedy.,6,4 August 2010,"I have an uneasy feeling that ""The perfect storm"" is trivialising the deaths of the crewmen of the ""Andrea Gail"" - not necessarily deliberately - but by turning their relationships with each other into the stock Hollywood clichés of male bonding rituals it turns a tragedy into a Hollywood ""tragedy"".Which is not the same thing at all. The grizzled vet,the punk kid,the deadly enemies that save each other's lives,the skipper ruling by force of personality and leading by example.....fifty years ago it could have been John Wayne and Ricky Nelson.....hang on,fifty years ago it WAS John Wayne and Ricky Nelson... So,to me,""The perfect storm"" comes on a bit like a wet Western with the good guys taking on the ultimate bad guy but losing out.Not something Howard Hawks would have approved of. The saloon bar,the cattle boss,the women who wait,Miss Mastrontio playing the saloon girl who wants to be one of the boys - very familiar stuff indeed I'm afraid. Mr Clooney's designer stubble doesn't suit him,I'm pretty sure he'd get more respect if he bothered to shave every morning. The scenes with the yacht in the storm seem totally irrelevant. The seascapes are well - photographed though,so I guess 6 out of 10 is just about right.",The Perfect Storm

Stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg did disappoint. I guess I took the bait in thinking that these two actors were going to be as good in this one as they were in their latter collaboration `Three Kings.' I do have to admit that one feature of the film that did not rain on my cinematic viewing parade was the extraordinary special effects.

45,mjneu59,mal de mer,2,26 December 2010,"It's common practice these days to manufacture the audience before making the movie, and one of the surest means to that end is to film a best-selling book, in this case Sebastian Junger's dramatic non-fiction account of a cataclysmic storm off the coast of New England in 1991. Never mind that the material is entirely unsuited to the screen: millions of people bought it, and some of those may have even read it, so what more do you want? Well, to begin with, how about something other than the usual Cartesian marketplace logic (I sell, therefore I am) as a reason for making the film in the first place? Junger's book covers a lot of territory and juggles more than one life-or-death crisis, dwelling in particular on the fate of the fishing trawler Andrea Gail, lost at sea with all hands, and the devastating effect of its disappearance on the close-knit seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. In print the multiple focus makes perfect sense: it's a maritime epic of men and women struggling against the implacable fury of the elements. But the unrelated parallel story lines (the primary one unresolved: no wreckage or bodies were ever recovered) don't lend themselves to easy adaptation, and screenwriter Bill Whitliff clearly wasn't up to the challenge.Of course no one expects such a willfully dumbed down dramatization to capture all the nuances of a good book. But Whitliff's strictly perfunctory script follows an all too dispiriting path of least resistance, attempting (fatally) to touch all the same narrative bases as its source, without even a token attempt to capture the raw documentary power of Junger's prose. Instead we get a shipload of cardboard cutouts straight from central casting, pointlessly battling against computer generated ninety-foot waves before making their inevitable, noble descent to Davy Jones' Locker.Keep in mind that every scene on board the doomed trawler is pure speculation, which may explain all the narrative whitewash. No doubt the producers felt obliged to appease the local Gloucester community (without whose blessing the film couldn't have been made) by showing their dearly departed in such a phony, flattering light. But for the surviving friends and family of the missing fishermen the lackluster results can hardly be called a comforting legacy, reducing a tragic true story to the same crass, commercial level of any other overblown FX extravaganza, complete with high profile Hollywood talent (George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, as Captain Billy Tyne and shipmate Bobby Shatford) lovingly photographed in screen-filling, video format close-ups.A faux-heroic music score by James Horner overlays every scene with a thick coating of saccharine gloss, and the whole package was (mis)directed by Wolgang Peterson, at the time still riding the reputation of his breakthrough international hit 'Das Boot'. The 1981 film was Peterson's ticket out of the European art house ghetto, but in all the years since then he hasn't made anything half as interesting or memorable. Certainly few other directors could succeed as well in making the wide Atlantic Ocean look like a sound-stage water tank.The (undeniably exciting) digital tempest is the only reason to recommend the film, a sad fact suggesting another lesson in Tinsel Town commerce: even the most slapdash feature can return a handsome profit with the addition of a few expensive visual effects. 'The Perfect Storm' is an ideal case in point, being one of those (now common) movies in which the camera-work is totally subservient to the lab work. But did it really need to otherwise be such a generic, empty experience? The pragmatic answer would have to be yes, if the only motivation behind the film was to make a fistful of money. In general, the more expensive the movie, the less risks it can afford to take in order to recoup its production costs. Which, in the end, makes it easy to see why the one perfect thing about 'The Perfect Storm' was its capacity to sell a lot of popcorn.",The Perfect Storm

After a particulary dry run for swordfish out of Gloucester, Mass., he takes his crew and the Andrea Gail out for one last fishing trip of the season.A Boston-area weatherman is having fits of glee as three separate weather systems converge over the Atlantic, combining forces to become one of the most devastatingly powerful storms of the century. While the crew of the Andrea Gail (Mark Wahlberg, John Hawkes, William Fichtner, Allen Payne and John C. Reilly) remains blissfully unaware of the forecast while hauling up a record number of swordfish from a calm sea over the Flemish Cap, we see Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), skipper of the fishing boat Hannah Bowden, heading for the coast as the storm builds to the west while trying desperately to radio a warning to Tyne. We also see the tiny sailboat Mistral and the three people onboard (Bob Gunton, Karen Allen and Cherry Jones) being tossed around by rough seas near Bermuda, and we witness the Coast Guard's heroic efforts to save them. Then it's back to the Andrea Gail, where the crew has foolishly decided to sail straight into the storm so they can get 60,000 pounds of swordfish to shore and make their fortunes.This puts us in the heart of the storm for some of the most realistic and sensational weather effects ever seen on screen. From here on in, it's pure thrills -- and let's be honest here, the real star of this film is the weather. Actors serve only to give the storm a human context. But what a ride -- the storm is so realistic you can feel the wind and water in your face, blinding your eyes, as the floor heaves and shakes beneath you.The Perfect Storm is based on a book by Sebastian Junger.

47,CubsandCulture,I am puzzled by the critical reception of this film,8,23 August 2020,"To my mind this was a perfectly cromulent survival story-abet a tragic one- that was rooted in historical fact about a some blue collar guys. I thought the script did everything it needed to put some characters you care about and some drama to be resolved in the context of a disaster story . So yeah Tyne and the gang are not the most complex characters but you come to know them and importantly care about them. The same is true to a lesser extent for the coast guard crew and the rich smucks on the sail boat. The plotting around developing character and interpersonal drama was just enough to keep you interested. But for some reasons critics dismissed this as ""simple"" and ""thin"" plotting and characters. A lot of the charm of these character is just how everyman they all are.The film is at its best rooting the story in legends of the sea and the lived experience of fishermen. The opening, closing segments are the most gripping of the film because it roots this story in a long historical line of sailors, fishermen. I think the moments that stay with me the most are just the day in the life of these guys. There is elegance to the film's simplicity that works.The film's technical aspects still hold up. The storm sections are still fairly believable and intense. The CGI is a bit too noticeable today but the film nails visualizing its title.",The Perfect Storm

49,jimbo-53-186511,Having the right director prevents the film from being a total washout,6,3 August 2019,"The year is 1991 and a group of fisherman set sail on their boat the Andrea Gail to catch some fish in the Atlantic Ocean. However, they soon find themselves in grave danger when 3 separate storms come bearing down on them on their return home.When I saw that this film had been based on a book I initially assumed that it was a fictional book and it's only after I've looked into this further that I've realised that it's based on real-life events. Anyway putting that to one side for a moment, I will let you have my thoughts on this film...It starts off OK (despite the fact that I felt like it lacked any kind of urgency) in its opening 30 minutes or so. I suppose this is meant to exist to set the characters up, but given how flat many of them are throughout the film then perhaps the film could have just started at sea which arguably would have made the film a much better 90 minute film rather than a slightly drawn out 120 minute feature which is sadly what we get served up here.There's no doubt in my mind that Wolfgang Peterson was definitely the right man for the job here; I've seen a great number of his films and one thing he does understand is action and spectacle and this is where the film is at its best; the second half of the film really showcases his talents and he does manage to create several breath-taking sequences and does his absolute best to try to bring about the terror and peril that our group of fisherman find themselves in. It's a shame then that the screenplay doesn't seem to be along for the ride in the same manner; as a character-driven film character development should have been front and centre in the picture, but sadly it simply isn't the case here. The likes of Fitchner and Reilly are good in the first half of the film and their dislike for each other acts as a good driver at the start of the film, but an incident in the first half of the film puts an end to their quarrelling (in a way it was nice to see, but having them at each other's throats throughout the film may have made the narrative more interesting in the sections of the film before the storm arrives). With only Reilly and Fitchner having any kind of camaraderie and with this only confined to the first half of the picture then it does leave many of the characters feeling dull, underwritten and uninteresting; Clooney is OK as the captain of the ship, but is given no dimension whatsoever, Wahlberg is annoying at times and isn't a particularly strong character, Fichtner and Reilly are only of interest in the first half and the other 2 characters barely contribute anything (the black guy is basically reduced to a clichéd stereotype) and Hawkes seems to be an interesting Jack the lad type character before entering the boat and all of this bravado seems to get lost when he enters the boat and he then seems to just be hanging around in the background which seems like a waste of a potentially interesting character.The Perfect Storm is at its best when the focus is on the action as the characters almost seem superfluous; the female characters are also poorly written and the film also seems to include a sub-plot involving another boat that finds itself in difficulty (it's inclusion in the story is puzzling, but perhaps was included to give some uplift given the film's rather downbeat ending).It's fortunate that the film had Wolfgang Peterson as its director as I suspect in less experienced/competent hands the film would have been a lot worse. The film is worth seeing more for the second half when our crew are ultimately in peril, but given the poor way that the characters are developed/used then I can't help but feel that this film has missed an awful lot of potential. Worth watching, but a little disappointing overall.",The Perfect Storm

That's purely in regards to the plot, which is manufactured and not linked much to the real life disaster.From the first scene it throws so many character motivations at you that it's hard to find time to actually feel connected to them.

52,barnabyrudge,"Surprisingly rewarding film, based on a ""what-if?"" version of a true story.",9,23 January 2008,"I remember entering the cinema to watch The Perfect Storm and expecting little of it. 'Decent but unremarkable flick, probably good special effects and lots of actors shouting above crashing waves and whistling winds'  that was the verdict I was expecting to be giving once the film has finished. A couple of hours later I came out of the cinema pleasantly surprised, shaken and moved by the intense and rewarding film I'd just seen. The Perfect Storm is a genuine sleeper  a film much better and more satisfying than you'd expect, which remains in the mind long after you've seen it.In the fishing town of Gloucester on the Atlantic coast of America, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) returns from what should be the final haul of the season with a disappointing catch. He persuades some of the local fishermen to join him for one last trip, a final shot before the season closes at earning enough cash to live comfortably. The crew consists of Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes) and Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly). As the sailors set off on their fishing trip, their friends and families wave them off in silent dread, as they do every time they set sail  knowing that their loved ones are at the mercy of Mother Nature on the deep blue ocean. Once they're far out to sea, the guys begin reeling in the fish, but their catch yet again is shaping up to be a disappointment. So Tyne takes them out into the middle of the ocean, the Flemish Cap, where they start catching hundreds of gigantic fish. Meanwhile, two ferocious storms collide behind them, making the journey back perilously dangerous. A third storm changes course and adds to the maelstrom, creating the most intense and powerful storm of the century  ""the perfect storm"", as an excited meteorologist declares. Tyne's crew begin their trip back with a full cargo, but unwittingly sail into the middle of this unimaginable storm. They find themselves and their ship  the Andrea Gail  locked in an incredible struggle to stay afloat, while their loved ones back home wait in anguish for them to return.By and large, The Perfect Storm hits the right notes and emerges an absorbing and involving film. There are occasional moments of awful dialogue  ""Billy, you're sailing into the middle of the monster!"" shrieks Mary Elizabeth Mastrantoinio in one particularly awkward scene  but aside from this the film is excellent stuff. The storm scenes are terrifyingly staged and leave one rocking in one's chair, especially on the big screen (see this in a cinema if you can). The story wisely takes its time in the build-up to the storm, sketching in character backgrounds and character relationships so that we actually give a damn about the protagonists. James Horner's music is cleverly used to generate tension and emotion, and Wolfgang Petersen keeps the film low-key but fascinating during the first hour and as intense as possible during its second hour.

I didn't even mind that the audience talked non-stop throughout it, as their conversations were mostly drowned out anyway.The movie blew not doing more Weather Channel explanations (I was thinking of other movies like ""Titanic"" that did the technical background explanations better). When they were fighting the waves I couldn't figure out what they were trying to achieve and wondering why they weren't already cowering in the hold.The non-watery acting was appealing (though if George Clooney was insistent on not doing a Down East accent than they should have taken out the line about him growing up in the neighborhood).I liked ""Waterworld"" better. But I actually really liked Waterworld.The music didn't support the action. The closing song by John Mellancamp is absolutely awful.(originally written 7/9/2000)",The Perfect Storm
56,hu675,This true-life disaster story has moments of excitement and drama.,8,22 July 2007,"In October, 1991. Six crew members of fishing boat ""The Andrea Gail"" (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, John Hawkes and Allen Payne) find themselves caught in the middle of the Storm of the Century. While trying to get back to land, they are trying to survived against three raging weather fronts. Which it combined to be the most infamous storms in recorded history.Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Poseidon, Troy) made an old-fashioned high drama/action/adventure that is based on a true story. This film is well acted, some exciting action sequences on air and sea, some touching moments but the screenplay by William D. Wittliff (Legends of the Falls) has moments of clichéd as well. This has one of the highest grossing films of 2000. This has fine supporting performances by Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. This has strong visual effects by the Oscar-Winner effects company:Industrial, Light & Magic.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong:Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound. DVD has three running commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and moderated by J.M. Kenny. Commentary two is by the visual effects supervisor and special effects producer. Commentary three is by the author:Sebastian Junger. The most fascinating commentary track is by Junger. DVD also an behind the scenes featurette and more. This film received two Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. This movie was probably most memorable in theaters. Viewers are better off watching the Widescren version of the DVD, instead seeing on Fullscreen in Cable TV. Nicely photographed by John Seale (City of Angels, The Hitcher, The Talented Mr. Ripley). Oscar-Winner:Barry Levinson is one of the executive producers of this film. Good music score by Two Time Oscar-Winner:James Horner (An American Tail, Braveheart, Titanic). Panavision.

If I was on that boat with these guys, I would've welcomed the storm!  Anything to get away from them!After the endless set-up, where every plot point and cliched character is established three or four times, you get further insulted by an overblown score by James Horner, who must have had his 'Titanic' Oscars in view when he wrote this score.  A word, James...a tugboat going to the middle of the ocean to catch a fish does not merit the dramatic strains you have produced. Leo and Kate are nowhere in sight. Then you're supposed to get as excited as the actors do when they finally begin to.....FISH?

61,triple8,Very Sad,7,10 April 2005,"I am not qualified to say how accurate this was. I have not read the book. All I can say is the story is, in itself, a tragedy and it is difficult to watch knowing what the ultimate outcome will be. I can't say I enjoyed this, it was a pretty rough movie to sit through. What I will say, is that the movie captured the sadness of the story and showed us something of what it's like to be in a situation like that and for that I'm giving it a 7. I'm nobody to judge how accurate the dialog was. I will say I do not know how this movie could have been made without SOME dialog.The performers all did a good job and I am mixed on the special effects. Sometimes I thought they looked very real, sometimes they looked like-well-just special effects. One thing that surprises me is how much the critics liked this, I truly did NOT expect the many critics' reviews to be so positive but even though, I cannot say I enjoyed this, I have to give kudos for the above mentioned things. It's a terribly tragic story and though the movie wasn't perfect it did a few things well. For anyone who may not have seen it-it's very tough to watch and knowing the ultimate outcome just makes it that much tougher. This movie isn't going to win any awards but it did some things well and rates about a 6.5 to low 7. Just know what your going to watch before you watch it.",The Perfect Storm
62,Spleen,"Wet, but not wet enough",5,4 November 2001,"Is the ending meant to be a secret?  If so, spoilers ahead.James Horner's scores are getting more irritating, less musical, less dramatically appropriate ... although what ""dramatically appropriate"" means in this context is anyone's guess.  What dramatic shape does a story about sailors who bicker for an hour or so, then get hit by a giant wave, then die, have?Watching this film is like watching a kangaroo get hit by a car.  Kangaroos and cars both travel at constant speeds, the former in straight lines, the latter along marked routes.  If you're watching from a distance you can predict the collision well in advance: boing ... boing ... boing ... boing... thud.  It's as if the stupid animal set out from the other side of the horizon specifically to get hit.  Now imagine that we're closely following a herd of kangaroos, chatting between themselves as they bounce along, before a truck hits the lot of them: boing ... boing ... boing ... boing ... THUD. That's the essence of this movie.  We see an inevitable disaster, and yet, in some sense, the disaster has nothing to do with the lives of the characters we follow: it's just a thud (or a splash) at the end.  It's not really a story of people BATTLING the elements, any more than the roadkill story was one about kangaroos battling traffic.The elements which the characters don't really battle lack any sense of saltiness or wildness, anyway, because they're just digital effects: tame and glassy.  I don't care how BIG the wave is, it doesn't look WET.  This kind of story cries out for genuine shots of the sea.  In fact, when I saw such shots (taken when the sea was calm), I was ready forgive the complete lack of dramatic focus ... but they didn't last long enough for me to actually do so.",The Perfect Storm
63,eric262003,One To Have A Wave Of A Good Time,9,1 May 2016,"Feeling guilty that I never had the chance to see it in theatres sixteen years when it was released, I had to wait until it was released on DVD before having the chance to see this gripping, but very emotionally charged film that is ""The Perfect Storm"". For a break from the monotony of giving away details I will without any spoilers, tell you all how I decided to watch this movie and how I'm recommending the movie community why this movie is something everyone should see this classic film. Before purchasing this movie, I kind of for a long time overlooked it and even ignored at the notion of watching this movie for the simple reason of not caring the least. I can't say I'm the biggest George Clooney aficionado, though he's a very talented performer and even Mark Wahlberg for that matter. Suffice to say these two performers are not in this movie for the girls to go gaga for. Their physical appearance is staggeringly quite scraggy and disheveled and very overwhelmingly worn out. On a plus side there is no Hollywood-like glorification in ""The Perfect Storm."" I was 15-years-old when ""No-Name Storm"" which was the name of ""The Perfect Storm"" was at the time came out back in October of 1991. At that age, weather was something that never crossed my mind. I vaguely remembered the events that happened 25 years ago except that there were three storms uniting within each other and that it was one of the scariest natural disasters in the East Coast I have ever witnessed. But there was more than just a nasty storm that erupted in the East Coast of North America than meets the eye. I didn't know that a ship was lost at sea in the midst of all this chaos. Then the book by Sebastian Junger came out and I neglected to read that as well. Then nine years later, the movie came into fruition, but the critics didn't have too much of a positive reception to it. Then after scurrying through the trailers, the documentaries and the making of the film, I was nevertheless curious to see what was the hype about this movie. I won't give away too many spoilers because we all know how a film like this will transpire. One thing for sure, the story's main focus isn't just circled around the fishing ship known as the Andrea Gail, but about an eager weather reporter who's enthusiastic to seeing the perfect storm materialize on his radar system, some subtle love subplots, another story about another ship that was saved, and the trials and tribulations the Navy encountered that led to the Andrea Gail being swallowed by the ""perfect storm"". For better understanding of the movie, I'd recommend you see the making of documentary. It was so inspiring that the crew went out of their way to film most of this movie off the coasts in Massachusetts. They even went as far to go in actual lobster and fishing boats and even took the occasional dip in eternally frozen waters to get the feeling of the cold and wetness of this awful storm. Clooney and Massachusetts' own Wahlberg got the chance to meet the locals there who have lost a family member/s who were on the Andrea Gail. It was cool that these families were portrayed in the movie and that the studio created special effects to make every scene all the more authentic. It shows that the crew were really doing their homework here. I suggest you all watch ""The Perfect Storm."" It's both technically done with no stone overturned and the the performances were very real and it shows how humans react when natural disasters hit close to home and where unity comes to life opposed to the divinity it is in our ordinary lives.",The Perfect Storm
64,philip_vanderveken,And the Oscar goes .... to the waves.,6,22 October 2004,"I never thought this would be a bad movie before I actually saw it. Since I saw Das Boot, I was convinced that Wolfgang Petersen is a great director. Das Boot is about a submarine in peril, The Perfect Storm about a fishing boat in trouble. In the end it is about the same theme ... a bunch of men fighting for their lives in the middle of the sea. Knowing this I was convinced that The Perfect Storm would be an excellent movie. But I was wrong ... If the director had cut out the first hour and focused on the struggle with the elements, this would have been a great movie, even an instant classic. Now it is a movie that will soon be forgotten.If you think you have to watch this movie for the great acting, think again... The cast is OK and they probably did everything they could to make the best out of it, but it just isn't good enough to save the movie. Especially the first hour, before the boat gets in the middle of the storm, is unbelievably boring, far too emotional and oh so predictable. It seemed like everybody already knew what was going to happen, like they already knew the boat isn't going to return.What I did like about the movie was the special effects. Thanks to these special effects, the movie really comes to life in the last section, when the storm hits. Those waves were absolutely terrifying. It almost feels like you'll be swept away by them yourself. You'll probably be on the edge of your seat during those storm sequences. If you see the movie, try seeing it on a big screen with a good sound system, I'm sure that's the best way to enjoy it. Having said all this, I think you know why you should or shouldn't watch this movie. I gave it a 6/10 only because I loved those special effects.",The Perfect Storm
65,mike48128,Best Seen Uncut. Almost a Perfect Disaster Movie,9,18 January 2014,"I had the misfortune of seeing this on cable on one of those channels that runs tons of commercials and ""pop-ups"" on the screen. See it uncut. Parts of it are truly spellbinding and shouldn't be diminished by interruptions. In essence, a perfect storm is a situation where everything goes completely wrong at the same time. Here we have a film, based on the true story of the boat ""The Andrea Gale"", of 6 brave fishermen trying to make a living in one of the most dangerous of all professions: They are underpaid sword-fishermen, from Gloucester, Mass. On their journey, one gets tangled up in the bait-hook line and is pulled overboard. One is nipped badly by a shark. Many overboard rescues, as they battle the storm due to desperation for the ""perfect catch"" and travel too far away from safe waters. Not for the squeamish, as baiting, harpooning and gutting the catch is vividly portrayed. The ""Storm of the Century"", in 1991, was the intersection of as many as 3 different (or more) tropical storms off of Bermuda. Most of the action, as the doomed crew tries very desperately to turn the boat around, is both fanciful and actual, because after the radio failed, no one knows exactly what really happened. The ship's mast breaks. The refrigeration fails. The anchor crashes through the windows. A Coast Guard helicopter goes down trying to attempt rescue. (They run out of fuel because they rescue people from a small yacht on the way there, and then airborne refueling fails.) Had they been able to fly directly to the boat, a rescue might have been possible. So many things go wrong at once that the brave crew never has a chance. An unbelievable giant ""wall of water"" capsizes the boat for the very last time. The perfect disaster. Fantastic action and special effects. Some salty language. The storm scenes ""feel"" real. Great performances by George Clooney and Mark Wahlburg. Quite an intense experience, and I saw it on a ""small"" 50 inch screen!",The Perfect Storm

67,MartianOctocretr5,"Poorly directed, sinks in a storm of blandness",2,4 August 2007,"Even though this film has some stylish special effects, it's one of the most boring films I ever watched. Considering the film is the depiction of an actual maritime disaster, this is a real shame.This is one of those movies that is so dull and weak in its execution, that most of what little it had to offer is soon forgotten. We see a bunch of commercial fishermen arguing, and catching fish. Then they go ashore, and fight and argue with their wives/girlfriends (wasted talents Mary Mastrantonio, Diane Lane, and Karen Allen). We hear some jumbled diatribe from a herd of meteorologists about a possible maelstrom, but everybody of course ignores these warnings, and sets sail once again. Apparently two large storms may converge, but little is done to explain to anyone why this exciting (other than to some fish, maybe).George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg don't do much to make the fishing boat daily routine activities especially interesting, nor do the endless camera shots of water to the horizon, with nothing on the sea to look at. The monotonous dialog of the fishermen reminded me of Forrest Gump and his friend droning on about shrimp boat fishing. What director Wolfgang Peterson was trying to do here is puzzling. The story of the peril and possible tragic loss of several people should touch the emotions, but he has made it slower than a middle school science class documentary, and given the audience no involvement whatsoever in what is transpiring.If you're interested in the story of what happened to the Andrea Gail and her crew, read the book instead. This movie is only useful as an insomnia cure.",The Perfect Storm
68,DeeNine-2,"Uneven, Hollywood-ized",6,2 September 2002,"This is not as bad as I feared. I would never have watched it except that it was mentioned twice in a noncommittal way in a book I had just finished reading, Stuart Pimm's The World According to Pimm: A Scientist Audits the Earth (2001). It starts out like something from any of half a dozen big project Hollywood directors, e.g., James Cameron (Titanic) or Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat), with faux realism and intrusive atmospheric sights and sounds and bits of background sound-bite conversations played too loud. I'm already shifting in my seat when I realize that Wolfgang Petersen, who produced and directed The Perfect Storm is none other than the very same Wolfgang Petersen who produced and directed the internationally acclaimed German language classic, Das Boot (1981), one of the best war movies of all time. So now I'm thinking, how bad can this be?Turns out that The Perfect Storm is one of those movies that can't decide whether it's a man's action flick or a woman's relationship saga. Petersen spends an inordinate amount of time giving each of his crew members some kind of relationship before sending them off into the mother of all storms, reminding me of movies where the guys go away to war and the women stay behind keeping the home fires burning. Enough time is spent in the bar to make me think we're watching ""Cheers"" or we're on shore leave before the final assault. Strange thing about this is that Petersen, in making Das Boot, didn't care in the slightest about establishing relationships or engaging the female audience. But times have changed. Today's Hollywood director knows that to get people into the theaters you've got to make sure that women's issues and interests are addressed.""Not that there's anything wrong with that!"" (A quote from Seinfeld in a different context, that you might recall.) But imagine how diluted and unfocused Das Boot would have been had Petersen spent half an hour delineating each of the crew's fraus and frauleins. However, some of the work was worth the effort. The relationship between Irene and Bugsy (Rusty Schwimmer and John Hawkes, both doing a good job) was different and compelling: ""I wish it was night so I could say, Goodnight, Irene."" He speaks true corn. ""There'll be a time for that"" she rejoins, to the point and suggestively. (I'm paraphrasing from memory.) But the relationship between male and female fishboat captains (George Clooney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) never got off the ground, and I yawned through the all too familiar quandary of young lovers, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.Anyway, at last we are out the harbor and onto the fishing grounds. I was hoping for some real authentic, little known color about long-line fishermen, and I got some: the storage cells where the fish are packed with ice, the lines going out baited, the shark on deck, still biting...but that was about it. I was also hoping for some fisherman point of view on the world-wide controversy about over fishing and the ""Tragedy of the Commons,"" but all we get is that they're not making as much money as they would like, and the boat's owner gets more than seems fair.Okay, so let's see the storm. And we do and it's a monster, with massive waves throwing people all over the place threatening to swallow up the little fishing boat. Best action shot: the wave blasting the cargo containers off the deck like toys (actually they were toys). But I kept thinking, who really knows what it was like on that boat in the middle of that storm? The boat flips over and flips upright and then flips again. Nobody knows who tried to get out and who didn't. And were the lights still on? I would think it would get pitch black at night under the water. What I'm saying is, the cheap cutouts used for some of the water scenes in Das Boot were more effective than the millions spent on special effects for The Perfect Storm. At least in the former we knew they were merely simulations. Here the attempt at realism underscores the fact that I'm watching a movie. Oh, and the musical score: not only intrusive, but unnecessarily directive in the sense that it's telling me how I should feel about what I'm watching.Bottom line: This is just interesting enough to keep a drowsy couple awake on a Sunday night, but be forewarned. The kids will want to stay up and see the storm.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

69,sme_no_densetsu,The Far From Perfect Storm,6,21 January 2008,"If you love compelling true stories brought to the screen as contrived pap then you'll love this movie. Not content to let the story make it or break it on it's own merit the filmmakers decided to overload the film with typical Hollywood bombast.I might as well begin with the casting. If George Clooney is a Gloucester swordfisherman then I'm the king of Spain. It could've been worse, though; Nicolas Cage was Wolfgang Peterson's first choice. At least the supporting cast has some talented individuals like John C. Reilly and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.I don't know how far the script deviates from the actual occurrences but it's chock full of clichés. Making matters worse is the emotionally manipulative score. As if it wasn't already obvious enough from the bald-faced statements of the characters we have the composer constantly trying to nudge us in the right direction.No doubt the main appeal of the movie is the special effects and while they're pretty good it's hard to care when the rest of the movie seems so laboured. Nevertheless, if all you want is a popcorn-munching waste of time then it's possible that this movie will fit the bill.",The Perfect Storm
70,Screen_Blitz,The Perfect Storm is captivating as well as terrifying to sit through,8,9 February 2016,"The disaster genre has not been successful in the past several years, rarely does a good, or at least memorable movie manage to squeeze out of the genre nowadays, The Impossible in 2012 for example. Every once in a while comes a surprise from this underused genre, this disaster drama directed by Wolfgang Peterson is one that graciously memorable and one that should still hold to this day. This movie set in the fall of 1991 tells the true story of Billy Tyne (played by George Clooney), a swordfisherman who leads his crew of fishermen on one last fishing expedition for the season across the Atlantic Ocean, despite the warnings of Captain Linda Greenlaw (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) of a nasty hurricane approaching. As you may guess, what starts off as an enjoyable time of fish hunting and drinking becomes a terrifying fight for survival when the crew is caught into the powerful storm that puts their lives in serious peril. Highlighting a stellar cast aside Clooney of Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, John Hawkes, Allen Payne, and Diane Lane; this movie pulls a truly terrifying experience sparkled with a great screenplay and credible performances.The title speaks well as this storm was called by meteorologists 'The Storm of The Century', and with the story dealing with such a devastating disaster; you should more than likely anticipate some emotional intensity to come. This is indeed, a really intense film that leaves your heart pounding and praying for the characters' survival, especially as this is a true story. Like many real-life based films, the accuracy of the events is subject for debate, but those who grow enticed by the moving story are likely to ignore the possible liberties this film takes. The characters are thinly developed but grow to be likable, even when they are shown to have rude sides such as the heated tension between John C. Reiley and William Fitchner. The performances by the cast are quite good, though none of them solidly stand out whether it is George Clooney stepping into the role of the well dedicated captain, or Mark Wahlberg playing a young rookie fisherman with a cautious girlfriend back at home played by Diane Lane . Nothing Oscar-worthy should be expected. The story moves at a decent pace and builds up to anticipated climax where the film reaches it's the highest point of it's emotional heft. The entire sequence of the violent storm are mightily brought to life by chilling special effects and dazzling visuals to embrace the authenticity, and leaves just enough room for an emotional impact to sink in as you fear for the characters' survival. The Perfect Storm does not sit on the throne of disaster movies, nor does it to. But it is a powerful film that is both entertaining and somewhat tear-jerking, and not in a manipulative manner. The cast performances are great, the screenplay works like a charm, and director Wolfgang Peterson does a gracious job on paying a tribute to the victims of the the disaster. The Perfect Storm is something worth watching.",The Perfect Storm
71,baumer,A perfect summer flick,8,3 July 2000,"A Winter film: pass the hanky and then give me an Oscar.A Summer film: pass the popcorn and then get me some cough syrup because my throat is sore from chearing so much.There is a distinct difference between seasons in Hollywood.  Studios keep their films about dying mothers with cancer and families that have to put up with those alcoholic fathers and psychological journies into the porthole of someone's mind, until the snow is on the ground here in Canada and the Northern U.S.A.  Summer films on the other hand, would take those same premises and twist them around so that the dying mother with cancer would be just a minor subplot for when the giant asteroid comes crashing to earth, the alcoholic father would be murdered by his son only to come back as a blood thirsty zombie and the porthole into someone's mind would really just be a porthole into hell where Jason and Freddy and perhaps the Grmelins rule together.  Winter films are praised for being risque and intelligent while summer films are chastised for being silly and sell outs.  But look at most of the top money making films of all time and you will realize that they came out between May 2-4 and Labour Day weekend.  Jaws, Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones, Batman, Independence Day, Lethal Weapons, Jurassic Park, E.T. All are brawny summer films.  The one exception, of course is Titanic, which came out just before Christmas in 1997 but that was such a great film that you could have released it in March and it still would have grossed almost 2 billion dollars.The Perfect Storm is another example of the summer film.  This is a film that has very little box office drawing power going for it, except that giant wave.  Clooney, Wahlberg and company are not box office giants but Warner Bros had great confidence in the film, so much so, that it hired an A-list director and it saturated the market with trailers and other forms of advertisments.  All of this built the consumer up with great anticipation and we were all dying to see it.  This was the one summer film that I have been looking forward to since I first began seeing clips of it about four months ago.  Now the big question is, does it deliver?  And the answer to that is a resounding YES!I think we can skip the commentary and summation of the story because it really doesn't matter.  In a nutshell, a bunch of fisherman get caught up in the biggest storm ever recorded and they have to battle mother nature. Simple enough story but its what they did with it that makes the film so compelling.  It's also funny, I have always thought that George Clooney could read the barf bag on an airplane and still make it sound interesting. But in The Perfect Storm, his role could have been given to anyone and the film still would have been great.  That is not a discredit to him, it is a credit to the rest of the film and those behind the scenes that were involved in it.  Much like Twister, the actors and the story take a back seat to the events and the special effects.  ILM and Wolfgang Petersen should be lauded as heroes for their work in this film.  I don't really have much to compare it to but the illusion that you are really at sea with these people is really quite the achievement.  Giants waves come crashing into the Andrea Gail, winds blow water mercilessly onto the boat and wreak havoc on it's passengers.  Thunder and lightning are omnipotent on this journey as well.  I can honestly say that my emotions were taken for a ride.  I was exhausted when I left the theater.  Even though we don't know the guys to well, we know them well enough that we care what happens to them.  There is also two other great sub plots as three passengers, on a small sailboat are caught down south in the eye of the storm.  And we also have the story of the heorics displayed by the Coast Guard and the other rescue team that attempt to rescue the Andrea Gail but fails.The Perfect Storm has a slow first thirty minutes.  And that is acceptable because you have to introduce the cast and the conflict and try to get some kind of emotion involved here.  In the beginning, we are introduced to Bob Brown, the owner of the Andrea Gail.  Played by Michael Ironside, I was thrilled to see him back in the movies.  I enjoy his work and even giving him a small role like this one was a credit to the film.  I also enjoyed seeing Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame back in the saddle.The Perfect Storm has everything going for it, a great cast, a veteran action director and a giant wave that has a thirst for blood.  This is a perfect summer film.  It may only win some technical Oscars but the fact that it will probably go on to be one of the three top films of the summer should be quite the consolation prize.  This film has the chance of breaking 400 million dollars in the world wide box office and that should be all the recognition it needs.8.5 out of 10.... The second best movie of the summer so far.  If you can't enjoy this film, there is always the winter coming up very shortly.  Jane Austin and Emma Thompson should probably have a movie produced by Merchant Ivory coming out in November or December, so don't fret.
For the rest of us.  Thank the movie Gods for films like The Perfect Storm!",The Perfect Storm
72,mstomaso,Warning: Dramamine Recommended,8,4 July 2005,"Yes I know. I've heard all the complaints already. ""That's not how it happened"" (as if anybody really knows); ""All of those events could not have co-occurred on the same boat in the same trip"" (as if anybody really knows); etc. etc. Well, here's my answer - it's a movie, just a movie. Don't see a movie to learn about ""what really happened"" unless the film states very clearly that it is a documentary. Films are, like good books, supposed to tell you something true about people, about things that happen, and about life. They're not (even when they're placed in the documentary shoebox) necessarily about what really happened and how.The Perfect Storm is a heavily fictionalized speculation concerning the experience of the Andrea Gayle and its crew during the 'storm of the century' in the early nineties. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg head a fine, under-appreciated cast, as regular yankee fishermen, their friends, and family, living in the Massachussetts town of Gloucester (pronounced ""Glosta"" for those of you from away). Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a once legendary long-line (swordfish) captain who is down on his luck and needs a big catch to bring himself back into the fold. He and his crew set out to find that catch on exactly the wrong day, in exactly the wrong place. The second half of the film is their attempt to get home, and also incorporates Coast Guard rescue action scattered all around the Atlantic during the massive storm.Having lived in Maine for years, and having gotten myself thoroughly immersed in the ballads of Ruth Moore and the amazing New England Maritime culture, I have to admit that I was predisposed to like this film, despite all of the issues my fellow reviewers have harped on. And no, I haven't read the book, nor do I intend to. Still, in an attempt to be somewhat objective, I gave it an 8 and I'll give it an above average recommendation, but I will also say that my inclination was to give it an 9 or a 10.This film mixes New England fishery and sailor lore, a few scattered facts about the Andrea Gayle Story, and a lot of dramatic license, to tell a story about the heroism of the average American and their families. It is also an homage to the the New England fishing industry and its traditions. Though it is easy to mistake the real life heroes (the Coast Guard operatives who saved so many lives during that storm) for the heroes of the film, the crew of the Andrea Gayle and their loved ones are the real heroes here - in their valiant efforts to save themselves, their boat, and their catch.The performances and the script are strong and the characters very well realized (though fictionalized). Wahlberg and Clooney are great. Clooney gives the best performance I have seen him give. Some of the smaller parts deserve special mention - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Ironside, Diane Lane and John C. Reilly are always very good (or better), but I was unexpectedly charmed by John Hawkes, William Fichtner and Janet Wright.It is impossible to discuss this film without talking about the amazing special effects. To summarize, the first time I saw The Perfect Storm, I actually had difficulty sleeping because I felt the bed rocking to the rhythm of imaginary waves each time my eyes closed. Had I seen it in a theater, I am convinced that I would have considered popping a dramamine. Although at times exaggerated, this is the best film re-creation of sea storms I have ever seen. Every scene is thoroughly believable and marvelously detailed, even down to the weird patchiness of an incoming torrent often called ""the calm before the storm"".Obviously, I liked this film. And I will give it a strong recommendation with a couple of caveats. First - if you're not somebody who appreciates New England culture and understands something of the kind of humble heroism ""Glosta Men"" (and women) are expected to have, you might not get it completely. Second - if you come to this looking for a story that rings true in the sense of objective history, you have come to the wrong place. Otherwise, sit back with some popcorn and somebody you love, and enjoy the ride.",The Perfect Storm

74,vip_ebriega,Plot and characters lost in the storm. Excitement comes at you in waves in PERFECT STORM.,8,31 May 2008,"My Take: There is so much to look at in this visually-stunning, special effects-laden disaster drama. THE PERFECT STORM is among the long line of disaster movies hitting beg screens during the 90's to the early 2000's, and like the likes of DEEP IMPACT, TWISTER and DANTE'S PEAK, THE PERFECT STORM is a filler of special effects that make the disaster sequences look real, and indeed, the storm is as perfect as the title suggests. Whether we see strong winds and gigantic flood waves to daring sea rescues, the effects here are the real stars, even if some of the leads include George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg Diane Lane and a dozen others. But really, the star is the storm, since much of the human characters here are cookie-cutter disaster movie material.THE PERFECT STORM is based on an autobiographical novel by Sebastian Junger, but the film is dampened as a cookie-cutter disaster movie that's a little weak on drama, which threatens the film's pacing. The film is quite slow, aiming to create a lot of dramatic scenes with the characters, but they are weak, considering that they are played by top-flight players. The performances are terrific of course, what more could we expect from popular Hollywood names? Although there seemed to be drama going on, it's hardly the film's finest moments.Much of the finest moments however goes to the storm itself. The special effects are marvelous in this film, even by today's standards. It's not as flashy, but that's probably for the best since the effects are need to be more real than cinematic. In fact, the scenes with the storm are more dramatic than any of the scenes with the humans. The scenes involving the daring sea rescues are breathtakingly compelling, and very well done of course. In a way, the storm offers the finest performance of the lot. Overall, the storm is perfect, which might be exactly what you payed for. THE PERFECT STORM exhibits some of the same problems I had with TWISTER. The characters are weak and the plot almost none-existent. But like TWISTER, the movie is worth seeing for the dazzling and seamless special effects, and the ultimate thrills they bring. Rating: **** out of 5.",The Perfect Storm
75,jhclues,"""Perfect Storm,"" Perfect Movie",10,5 July 2000,"Based on a true story, and dedicated to ten thousand Gloucestermen lost at sea since 1623, `The Perfect Storm' is a powerful movie that will take you places to which you've never been before.  Director Wolfgang Peterson has deftly crafted an intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat captained by Billy Tyne that left Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1991, and soon encountered the storm of the century.  After a less than profitable trip out, Captain Tyne (George Clooney) sets out again in October, with a crew of five men, and heads for deep water and a place know as the `Flemish Cap.'  It's a dangerous trek for that time of year, but he assures his men that the catch will be worth the risk.  What he could not foresee, however (nor could any meteorologist), was that three major storms would converge to form a single storm, the likes of which comes along only once in every one hundred years or so.  Fate steps in further when, after their catch is made, their ice making machine burns out, leaving them without the means of packing and preserving the fish.  They have no choice but to go back in, directly through the storm, lest the fish spoil, in which case all of their work, and the risks taken, would be for naught.  Tyne lets the crew decide; do they turn away and wait out the storm, losing everything, or do they prove that they're `Gloucestermen,' and try to make it back. 	What Peterson did with this film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with the novel, `Moby Dick;' as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time you're in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know what this boat is and how it works, you've smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. 	The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne; he knows him from the inside out, which enables him to convey a real sense of who this man is. And it shows in the way he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in his eye.  He's tough without any unwarranted theatrics or bravura, is self-assured, but aware of his own shortcomings, as well.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth; It's all there, and Clooney makes it real.  Mark Wahlberg, also, is outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).  Lane gives a notable performance here, too, as does John C. Reilly, who does an emotional turn as `Murph,' the veteran fisherman with a young son he loves, and who lives with the remorse of past mistakes that cost him his wife. 	Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in `The Perfect Storm,' but it's also inspiring; once you've seen the Coast Guard in action, for example, you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes this such a great movie, though, is that it's about real people, doing their jobs and going about living their lives like we all do. It's an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible, ones with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is an emotionally charged, unforgettable film; you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And therein lies the true magic of the cinema.  This is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss. 10/10.",The Perfect Storm
76,CharltonBoy,Not bad but not Brilliant,7,4 January 2001,A perfect storm is the story of a group of Gloucester fisherman and the time in 1991 that they met up with the Mother of all storms while trying to make a living catching Swordfish. The special affects are superb as is most of the acting but what i do not like is the sentimentality of it although with this story it can be forgiven mostly because of what happens in the end the film. The really is nothing in the story that makes it stand out from any other film but as it is a true story they couldn't really change the plot. I wonder if the family of some of the people who are being portrayed are entirely happy with the way they come across because some of the characters are not the nicest of people. 7 out of 10.,The Perfect Storm

Wolfgang Peterson spends the first part of the movie introducing the crew of the sword fishing boat, and by the time the ship sets sail on its voyage into destiny you care for each and every member of the crew.

I can see the producers pitching this movie, when the CEO says, ""Let me see if I get this right. You want me to give you EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS to make a movie about some fisherman trapped in the storm of the century and EVERYBODY DROWNS?""  Sounds like a Bob Newheart routine.  Knowing what happen is why I avoided this movie in the theaters even though I figured, ""Any movie in which George Clooney dies can't be all bad.""  Of course, that's before Clooney redeemed himself in my eyes with ""Three Kings"" and ""O Brother, Where art Thou"".  Apparently, the humiliation of ""Batman and Robin"" knocked the smugness out of Clooney and he is showing the promise he displayed in ""Bodies of Evidence"" instead of the Narcissm he perfected as Dr. Ross in ""ER.""Certainly if the producers were going to make an expensive bummer of a movie, they choose the right talent.  Wolfgang Petersen is the perfect choice to make a movie about ""doomed men on a doomed boat,"" as anyone who saw ""Das Boot"" can testify.  Diane Lane is a standout among a very talented cast.  I believe she should have garnered an oscar nomination.  James Horner's score is outstanding, as are most of the effects (except for a couple of CGI sequences involving a Coast Guard helicopter).Note:  I bought the DVD at half.com for about what I would have paid for a ticket to this movie, which is probably another reason why all the major theater chains are bankrupt.  I bought it mostly to show off my home theater system.  Frankly, ""Twister"" does a better job with that, primarily because of the superior surround sound.

OK like in all those films the effects are good, but that's where it ends, for you do not care about the characters and the movie is not at all exciting or dramatic.

88,eibon09,Overhyped,3,4 April 2001,"The Perfect Storm(2000) is one of the most overrated and worst films in the year 2000.  The second straight turkey for director, Wolfgang Petersen.  Had the makings of a masterpiece but was ruined by the casting of Hollywood stars, Computer effects, and an unprovokative story.  I saw this movie during a special screening and was not impressed by it.  George Clooney gives an uninspired performance in not one of his better roles.
The Perfect Storm(2000) would have been a great film if it had the following things.  An unknown cast with some experienced fishermen from that part of New England.  A realistic story with minimum computer and special effects. A low budget as well as a talented but unproven director.  Realistic characteristics of the late fishermen who lost their lives at sea.
Michael Ironside is excellent as the jerk fisherman boss who is partialy responsible for what happened to the fishermen.  What I hate about The Perfect(2000) is that it rips off The Wages of Fear(1953) and Das Boot(1981).  More like The Wages of Fear at sea than a tragedy about the deaths of the fishermen from New England.  The character of Bobby Shatford and Captain Tyne are one dimensional versions of the captain and the news reporter from Das Boot(1981).  If you want to see a film that really makes you heart beat with dread and trembling for suspense than I Suggest you watch the great and superior film, The Wages of Fear(1953) which is a true study of human tragedy.",The Perfect Storm
89,Movie-12,So horribly written with such little intellect or thought it becomes lost and stranded within its own limited philosophy of man verses nature. * (out of four),2,10 August 2000,"THE PERFECT STORM / (2000) * (out of four)Wolfgang Petersen's recent adventure drama, ""The Perfect Storm,"" is so poorly written with such little intellect or thought it becomes lost and stranded within its own limited philosophy of man versus nature. The film contains ideas that present themselves with amazing special effects, but go nowhere because the special effects are the subject of the film. Instead of crafting a motion picture in which defined characters pursue a path bombarded with conflicts, screenwriter Bill Wittliff creates an excuse to place characters in a situation laden with conflicts-and a horrible excuse at that.The film, based on a book established by a true story by Sebastian Junger, takes place at Gloucester, Massachusetts in the Fall of 1991. Determined captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is experiencing a slump in his normally successful fishing career. His boss is not happy with him, so when he decides to head for the plentiful grounds of the North Atlantic on the Andrea Gailand, he promises to bring back loads of fish.Billy's crew is not glad to head out to sea for the second time in the past week, having to again leave their families and lives behind. The young and lively Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) and his fiancée, Chris (Diane Lane), have just purchased a new home for their upcoming lives together. Chris does not want her love to go out to sea again, because she is fearful of the dangers. Other crew members, including Sully (William Fichtner) and Murph (John C. Reilly) have a rough time getting along with each other. Billy's navigator friend, Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), warns of upcoming bad weather, but the crew ignores her cautions and heads out to sea regardless.The film's characters are sloppily written and contrived. Each individual character has a depressing nature to them; most come attached with a soap opera type of cliché. The production's idea of character development consists of having the John C. Reilly character discuss heartfelt feelings about his divorce with his young son, and Mark Wahlberg complaining about struggles with his divorce to his ripe, weary new love interest who wants him to quit his beloved career in fishing. Diane Lane is profoundly overacted-and very poorly overacted may I add. George Clooney is all occupational; he contains no internal introduction, only shallow business motifs. Other characters are defined though their prominent desire to obtain romance, alcohol, sex, and success. These repulsive characters are so unbelievably exaggerated, sappy, and phony I chuckled at the insanity of it all.Tyne and his fishing crew encounter great success on their journey, bringing on a fortune in catch. Two weeks after their departure, however, as the film's tagline reveals: ""an event took place that had never occurred in recorded history."" Before that incident occurs, however, the filmmakers cannot resist adding in little encounters portraying dangers of the ocean. The events include a vicious shark attack, a startling fishing accident, and even dramatic human conflicts on board the Andrea Gailand. All these trends provide an increase in tension at sea, gradually building up for the forty-five minute climatic storm that features scene after scene of massive waves crashing against the petite boat in which our crew members are stranded. However, after the first ten minutes, the reckless waterfront becomes stale and tedious, reducing what little suspense the movie has into absolute boredom.There are several dispensable and undeveloped subplots included in ""The Perfect Storm."" The human problems aboard the Andrea Gailand are completely disposable since the two characters who constantly bicker and fight have no justifiable reason to support their actions, not that we care about either character in the first place. There is also a story about a trio of characters on a sailing adventure for pleasure. This subplot is never introduced or expanded upon. This scenario plays such an important role in the production that it is a wonder why the filmmakers never bother to develop the characters or situations involved. Their present in the film is only to further examine the likelihood of the colossal hurricane approaching, but since we simply could not care less about the subjects, this side story goes unrecognized.""The Perfect Storm"" is altogether superior filmmaking; from the overwhelming special effects to the atmosphere of men struggling at sea, the movies technical qualities are spectacular. Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to know of the intensity created by such visual effects, and milk them for every penny they are worth-to the point where not even these special effects can induce thrills.The movie is dedicated to the many fishermen who tragically lost their lives at sea since the year of the perfect storm, 1991. It is mournful that so many individuals have died on their journey to bring fish to consumers everywhere, therefore, I will not make light of the true story behind this movie. As far as the actual film goes, however, I did not care a bit for the characters. As the waves of the endless ocean tower over their minuet boat hopelessly drifting among the tide, the most I could concern myself with is praying the neat fishing boat would make it to safety in one piece.""The Perfect Storm"" is brought to you by Warner Bros.",The Perfect Storm

This film got a lot of criticism because it didn't have a happy ending. Well, the film ended the same way as actual events, so I really fail to see how that is a valid criticism.  It is also effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  The scene of Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) helplessly bobbing alone among the fifty-foot swells drives that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9/10.

Mark Wahlberg turns in another fine performance bringing both strength and sensitivity to his character.  John C. Reilly gave a supporting performance as good as any of the stars.  The film offers effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  Scenes of people helplessly bobbing among the fifty-foot swells drive that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9/10.  What it lacks in story development, it almost completely makes up for in visual effects and suspense.  I highly recommend it.",The Perfect Storm

Perhaps I'm just getting a bit bored of these types of films, I don't know.Clooney and Wahlberg were competent enough as the captain and crewman of the Andrea Gail, Mary Mastrantonio overacted as usual and was as bad as usual - and very unconvincing.The first hour was quite bright and the rest quite dark, so perhaps that's why I came out of the cinema a bit depressed, cos I already knew the ending before I went of course.Don't think I'll bother with the video.",The Perfect Storm
93,nathanmanson,3 is very generous,3,7 December 2020,Just because you have big actors in the film doesn't make it a good film. For a film with a lot of action it sure was boring. I'm also confused how it's a true story but everyone died. How can it be given as a true story but no one actually knows what happened on that boat. I can guarantee in real life the storm hit and the boat went over and they died. Why did they have to make this film about it. They should've just made a storm film that wasn't a true story with a good ending would've been a lot better.,The Perfect Storm
94,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,27 January 2020,"The film takes you once more to embark on stories on the high seas. So it has happened in many other stories already produced by the cinema. Sea in Fury was only a film to bring good air to those who tie themselves in emotions in waves. that the story of the film was very true, and certainly exciting but still who watches it.

It had so much suspense, I found myself actually hoping the crew of the Andrea Gail would make it through the storm.  For me, the highlights were not so much the performances of the actors, but the special effects. The movie was based on a true story from 1991 out of Gloucester.  Although some creative license were taken, Hollywood did not sugarcoat the events, as it so often does.  It may not make for a happy story, but it pays respect to the Gloucestermen who went to sea.",The Perfect Storm

""The Perfect Storm"" is based on a true story but for those who are not familiar with the story are left with hope that this would end well for the characters. this is not the case with this sad movie. this is not the typical happy ending hollywood movie where the heroes get to go back home. even though it is very sad the movie is just fantastic. the visual effects were good but the story itself is very beatiful and powerful. the actors have done a wonderful job with bringing life to the film and all the sequences in the sea were nice.",The Perfect Storm
97,jhaggardjr,Outstanding movie based on fact,10,30 June 2000,"""The Perfect Storm"" is an outstanding motion picture. The movie is based on a real life incident that took place in October 1991. Three big storms in the Atlantic Ocean collided with each other to create the ultimate hell on the high seas. The film focuses mainly on the boat Andrea Gail and its crew. The ships real life captain is Billy Tyne, played by ""E.R."" veteran George Clooney. He and his fellow crew members want to fish one last time before the end of the fishing season because they've been in a slump with their previous trips, and they need the paychecks. However, they are unaware of the dangerous weather that lurks close to them. And when they attempt to make their way home, they run into very rough seas. It takes a while for this part of the film to come, but it's well worth the wait. ""The Perfect Storm"" was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who's last film, ""Air Force One"", is one of my all-time favorite movies, and this film is just about up there in the same league. The special effects are terrific, and should get an Oscar nomination. Those high seas are scary to look at. The sound categories should be Oscar recognized too. The movie doesn't go for much character development, but so what! I've read some of what the critics have said about this film, and once again they're complaning about the characters (in a big event type of film) not being developed enough. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! Why can't they for once just go along with it! I don't understand this. All that matters is that the film is well-made, exciting, thrilling, humorous (at times), and that it has some good performances from its cast. And that's exactly what it is. Why Chicago's popular film critic, Roger Ebert, gave ""The Perfect Storm"" ***1/2 stars. He likes it. One of Chicago's other film critics, Michael Wilmington (of the Chicago Tribune newspaper) gave it ***. After seeing the previews for ""The Perfect Storm"" and hearing that it was based on a true story, I really thought that this was going to be one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2000. Thanks to all the critics who gave it a thumbs down (and they're have been alot of them), it doesn't appear it will be an Oscar-caliber movie. I think all the critics who didn't like ""The Perfect Storm"" should have their heads examined. This is a great movie, and as far as disaster films go, only James Cameron's ""Titanic"" (the best) and Irwin Allen's ""The Towering Inferno"" (second best) are better. But ""The Perfect Storm"" finishes a close third.

100,chrisbrown6453,Yet another time where Hollywood destroys a true story.,6,12 July 2001,"The Perfect Storm chronicles the dramatic events that resulted from a phenomenal storm formation in the North Atlantic region in the Fall of 1991. Based on a true story, The Perfect Storm follows the ""Andrea Gail"", a fishing boat that left Gloucester, Massachusetts and headed directly into the eye of a hurricane of unprecedented proportions.Realizing his fishermen were underpaid and overworked, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) decides to make the last fishing expedition of the season and aim for more distant and abundant waters. Although leaving their homes and their loved ones required tremendous will power, the promise of a more successful venture convinced fishermen Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly) and David Sullivan (William Fichtner) to join, and Andrea Gail optimistically departs. Soon, however, family members' unanimous discontent about the sporadic nature of the trip combines with deteriorating weather conditions. Conflicts arise when Captain Billy and his crew decide to ignore Captain Linda's (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) radio warnings about the perfect storm brewing close ahead.The Perfect Storm slowly builds up to Andrea Gail's departure, and initially focuses on each fisherman's personal situation. Although these depictions offer enough information about the characters' needs and their devotion to the sea, they are not sufficient to create in the viewer a sense of sympathy for each character. Consequently, these scenes do not provide a setup that is affective and they fail to offer an intriguing premise as the basis for the drama that will eventually unfold. As if to compensate, the swelling music that accompanies these scenes tries to provide a feeling that something is leading up to a great event.When Andrea Gail is at sea and it is clear that the ""main event"" will be her struggle with the ocean's temperament, The Perfect Storm's plot oscillates between escalating complications (mainly accidents or animosity among the fishermen) and the downslides of their respective little victories, as the complications are safely resolved. While these choices seem to create a tantalizing suspense, they mainly throw the viewer's expectations off balance and they interrupt the flow of the plot's main undercurrent: the perfect storm. Furthermore, the climactic event evolves while other smaller dramas, such as a coast guard helicopter trying to rescue a family, or the helicopter running out of fuel, unfold simultaneously. This distracts from the main focus and suggests that the main plot needs simultaneous drama. With the help of patchy photography and ridiculously cartoony special effects, The Perfect Storm is unsuccessful in its attempt to define the ocean as being truly magnificent --or rather, perfect-- when it is most dangerous.",The Perfect Storm
101,bat-5,An amazing film.,8,9 July 2000,"The Perfect Storm takes a real life event, and gives us a sense of what it might've been like on The Andrea Gail during that storm.  We are introduced to the crew of the Andrea Gail as they return from a previous trip.  We get to know them a little, and we see that they are average guys who are trying to make a living in a very dangerous job.  George Clooney is Captain Billy Tyne and he brings a ruggedness and down to earth quality to the film.  He lets us know what it's like to captain a swordfish boat.  The responsibility, the plotting, the navigating and the cargo they're searching for all rest on his shoulders.   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays another swordfish boat captain who has an admiration for Tyne.  The scenes between these two illustraits the allure of the sea.  Once the Andrea Gail sets out on it's final voyage, we see what a chore swordfishing is, and the hazards involved.  Not to mention the long hours and dangerous conditions on the open sea.  Once the storm hits, things get crazy.  Ships are tossed around like they were nothing and in one of the more intense sequences, we see a rescue at sea and just how dangerous and nerve wracking that can be.   The Perfect Storm is a story about everyday men, battling the overwhelming power of the ocean.  There is a Hemmingway quality to these men. They live life to the fullest, and they soak up every minute of it. Hemmingway always wrote stories about man against nature, here we see real life men battling nature, and you realize that you don't have to be wealthy, a sports star, or anything else to be a hero. You just have to be who you are.",The Perfect Storm

Fictional elements such as hauling up a shark, getting caught on a hook and pulled overboard, personal beefs, and anchors swinging wildly, are all added bit of exposition, but they are events that happen to longline fisherman.In this, you get some personal details about the Andrea Gail's crew back on the beach - but it's really all about the boat in the historical storm and the subsequent rescue effort. It's nice to see AF Pararescue get some Hollywood love...everybody thinks of SEALs, but those guys are equally trained (if not more).No matter your view of this film...it's the best on the storm and tells the story effectively.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",The Perfect Storm

If you do these things, you will laugh and make silly comments during the movie.  I just thought I'd share that so on to the review.This movie was awesome!  It reminded me of what ""Titanic"" might look like if the people who complained about the romance directed their own version. Here, it's just the guy who gets sent out in the boat to collide with destiny while his girlfriend stays at home and lives.  Seriously, though, I loved this movie.  It was very exciting and I can't imagine waiting to see it on video.  It will loose the impact it had in the theater.

That being the case most of all the other actors are pretty much uninteresting, but when that STORM hits wow it is killer.There is though a little bit of ridiculousness that only Hollywood can make to a film like this such as having 2 men jump off a boat to rescue a man going over board, (Big mistake), and a helicopter jumper jumping in without a life line...

105,Brian-272,Far From Perfect.,2,3 July 2000,"The Perfect Storm simply does not live up to it's title, it's more The Perfect Hype. Though Realism occupies the whole film as this picture is based on the October 1991 Gloucester, Mass storm that occurred just off the North Atlantic. Sebastian Junger also wrote a novel about this incident, and Wolfgang Petersen did a great job of adapting this story of The Andrea Gail to the big screen as his directing of the film was more than adequate. The film has the big special effects, and Warner Brothers did a great job marketing and advertising the film plus the release schedule was just right the weekend before the 4TH of July which helped the film open at 41 million in ticket sales. Now finally the reasons that I don't like the film first the film simply does not take on the shape of a hero figure some may argue, but all of the fisherman die in the film and as you know in most movies all heroes survive and finally I don't care what or how important your job is you simply don't risk your life for fish especially when you know a titanic storm is coming there's always another day to fish and perhaps hunting for another job would be better in my opinion fishing should only be a hobby these fisherman were doomed from the start common sense could have saved their lives remember Captain(George Clooney) had a chance to turn the ship around but decided against it. Miss this movie if all possible still it is much better than the trash like Waterworld(1995) In fact Waterworld you couldn't sell the film for what you think it's worth sea movies just don't happen to be favorites of mine especially Kevin's Waterworld. The Perfect Storm is much better than the make-believe Waterworld, but nothing special you can give it a try yourself, but you will see it's only so-and-so.",The Perfect Storm
106,mnpollio,Perfect effects; An imperfect film,4,27 April 2007,"Sebastian Junger's biographical bestseller concerning a group of fishermen trapped in the heart of a terrifying super-storm brought about by a bizarre series of meteorological coincidences was a gripping and intelligently realized novel.Sadly, the same cannot be said for the film, which is flat and largely unenthralling until the final catastrophic moments. Much of the problem for the film comes from the structure and the dialog. The novel had the luxury of giving background on the fishermen and establishing the atmosphere of the town and its history with the sea. It also related the tales of several groups of people trapped within the destructive fury of the storm other than the fishermen. By contrast, the film has limited time to establish the fishermen and their town and the end result is laughably bad dialog that seems lifted from Marlboro Man or Miller Lite commercials. Whenever an obstacle rears its head George Clooney's team leader shouts ""Are we Gloucestermen?"" The film focuses almost solely on the fisherman and omits altogether or barely gives a nod to the other people trapped in the storm. Blink and you might well miss Cherry Jones and Karen Allen in thankless roles as some of these survivors. As the focal crew is ill-fated obviously what occurred on the boat in the final hours is supposition. The book took the position that due to the failure of communication it was debatable how much the fishermen knew on the severity of the situation in which they found themselves. By contrast, the film views them as fully aware macho posturers who steam full speed ahead into danger and damn the consequences. They are little more than clichéd peacocks attempting to prove their masculinity and the film ends up trivializing both the men and their lives.Given the thinness of the roles, none of the cast seems able to rise to the occasion. Most of the supporting cast is forgettable. Clooney was still in his head-bob/smirk phase that characterized some of his earlier film work. Mark Wahlberg is probably the most developed of the men, but he runs the gamut of emotions from point A to, well, point A. Meanwhile, back on dry land, the usually reliable Diane Lane (as Wahlberg's girlfriend) turns in an increasingly embarrassing performance which becomes more out of control with each new scene. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio shows up briefly, as a colleague on another boat, to flirt with Clooney and then concludes her performance with a laughably over-the-top hysterical warning to Clooney that rings totally false in its histrionics.The effects are astounding, but one must have a reason to identify and become emotionally involved with the participants (as readers were with the novel from which this came). The film, however, supplies us with cardboard thin, totally unbelievable caricatures that spout inane patter at each other until the effects take over from them. A real let-down.",The Perfect Storm
107,squirrel_burst,"Wicked storm effects, definitely something to see on the big screen. The story? Just so-so.",5,7 April 2015,"""The Perfect Storm"" features some excellent special effects and some good thrills while at sea, but the film ultimately fails to generate real drama. The story spends ample time developing the characters and getting us to know them, but nearly half of it is on land so I felt like I was missing out. My understanding is that if you take the book this film was based on, you take some of the actual facts of what happened on the commercial fishing boat Andrea Gail, you make up a events and toss some wicked special effects together you've got the plot of this movie. Desperate for money after a series of bad catches, Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his crew, consisting of Mark Wahlberg as Bobby, John C. Reilly as Murph, William Fichtner as Sully, Allen Payne as Alfred and John Hawkes as ""Bugsy"" all set sail unaware that there is a storm brewing on the ocean The titular ""Perfect Storm""! Once at sea the crew spends so much time barely making it through the day and bickering between each other that when they get into some severe weather trouble we really don't feel like they stand a chance. They never proved to me that they can handle your run-of-the-mill stressful situation so when things went bad here, I was underwhelmed. We never see the well-oiled machine that would boldly go into the ocean thinking nothing can stop them so the ensuing streak of catastrophes feels like it was just something inevitable instead of a tragic and frightening development. It'd be like mocking Freddy Krueger on a Halloween night while staying at Crystal Lake. It would be a shock if you DIDN'T end up being in a horrific situation. I also feel like a big gripe that I have with the film is its length. The film also has several sub plots that could have been dropped. At 2 hrs. + this disaster film is way too long for its own good and some audiences will check out way before the titular storm even arrives. Whether you get bored or not you'll likely leave puzzled after seeing the ending. Even though the final events do follow the rest of the film logically and it's clear that it was genuine respect and admiration that inspired the film it's a big miss-step that brings it down even further. In the end it's not really that the movie is that bad as much as it's underwhelming considering how great the well done moments are. I say it's a middle-of-the-road picture because half of the movie is just kind of OK, and when the storm is raging, it's awesome so it averages out to an average movie. I do admire the special effects though, if this movie was ever released in theatres again, and maybe even in 3-D it would look terrific and I'd jump to the opportunity to see it again.

109,The_Core,The perfect mindless summer entertainment!,7,19 July 2000,"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said?  Turn your brain off and watch, and you'll have a great time with this movie.  Sit up close to the screen!  Much better than ""Twister"" (far less cornball), with just the right amount of character development for this kind of movie (very little, but just enough to keep you interested in the fate of the characters).  The storm scenes were awesome, and I thought they were pretty seamless; the waves looked real, with no obvious CGI (the waves moved like real waves do).  At one point I looked around the theater and noticed the audience was absolutely riveted to the screen, many on the edge of their seats.  I felt like I had been through the wringer at the end, and also much cooler - nothing like watching cold ocean water and enormous waves in an air-conditioned theater to cool you off on a hot summer day!The only thing I felt was a little off-balance is that at many points, there seemed to be far less happening on board the ship than you would have guessed there would be considering the size of the storm.  A lot of water flowing around, things moving around... but not quite the level of violent movement and flowing water you would expect given the level of the storm raging outside.  And of course, the infamous ""there is only love"" line toward the end of the movie did not fit at all with what was going on. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice sentiment, but not something I would guess someone normally thinks about at such a moment (what do I know, though?). Also, the music seemed kind of inappropriate at certain points -- I liked the score overall, but I got the feeling not enough attention was paid to synchronizing the score with what was going on, especially before the storm, during the scenes where the crew was interacting with each other.Anyway, 5/10 for the movie, 9/10 for the storm/FX/atmosphere, 7/10 overall for this one.

111,fimimix,....it was perfect to me..,10,6 August 2006,"I will admit, right off, ""The Perfect Storm"" was the first VHS I ever bought, BEFORE I owned a VCR. AND - I was already past 65 when this happened! Indeed, I am ancient, although I think like a teenager. I was shopping in Ralph's market and saw the VHS on a stand. I had seen the movie in the theater; I didn't hesitate to buy it, and then went right out to a store and bought a VCR. Almost everyone who commented on this movie saw it in a theater.I digress: I suppose not too many people have seen the ocean when it gets to be as furious like in ""The Perfect Storm"". I am a native of the Gulf Coast; my friends and I couldn't wait till the ""hurricane season"" started, because we'd flock to the beach for swimming......such deep water ! That was before the weather went crazy and the hurricanes have become such monsters. So, I have a little more insight about what a perfect storm could be like - I would also like to say you can't get me on the ocean now-a-days - this movie vividly demonstrates ""you can't mess with Mother nature"" (some folk admitted that). You saw in this film that no matter how large a ship is, the water is stronger and certainly unpredictable. That first ship you saw was a tanker about as big as a football-field - the second, maybe bigger......loaded with containers. If you haven't been to a port to witness how large these ships are, then you certainly have no business trying to critique a movie about the ocean. A lot of people mentioned ""The Titanic"" - it was a small ship, compared to today's; The Queen Mary is permanently docked at Long Beach, and you'd be surprised how small IT is. The QM-2 recently docked along-side of it (2006), which made it look like a skiff. Not yet, but eventually one of the super cruise-ships will sink (""Poseidon Adventure"") and the world will be shown you take your life in your own hands by venturing out onto the oceans. Remember ""The Andrea Doria""?Now, think about people who sail on those boats from the East Coast just about every day to fish for a living. If you think the North Atlantic is bad, the ships that fish in the North Pacific close to Alaska are immense. Yet, they are constantly sinking; the pay is so high for the men who work on these ships, they feel they'll do one season of fishing and make enough money to get on their feet - and they're right.I suppose those who were so terribly disappointed in the cast of ""The Perfect Storm"" were expecting some heavy acting, maybe people in evening-clothing, highly emotionally sensational lines. Guess What! The actors/actresses in this film were perfect, because they ARE working, not having a party. The folk left at home are terrified, because they know the danger of sailing on the seas. What ordinary people don't realize is, we've killed all the fishing-grounds along our country's coasts, and the ships DO have to sail halfway to the next continent to make a catch. So, the next time you eat a tasty crab-leg from Alaska, just keep in mind that someone was scared to death catching it.""The Perfect Storm"" story set-up was extremely believable. The fishermen who work on the boats are not always compatible and they do not always get along, except when emergencies surface. The beating the ""Andrea Gail"" took as soon as the storm began was very believable.If you'd read ""more"" of the ""trivia"" section, you'd know that some of the scenes were shot ON THE FRINGES of hurricane Floyd - all of it wasn't done in that huge tank. The circular motion of winds in a hurricane DO make for huge waves that collide into one another, not long lines of high water. Again, if you haven't actually witnessed a hurricane, don't write like you're an expert - sitting in a theater doesn't give you expertise to do this. Sorry you spent your $8.00 to see the movie, but it was your decision - no one guaranteed you were going to like the movie.......So, folk: you need to give this movie a break. Yes, The Coast Guard does make actual rescues in the ocean; consider how many they've rescued between Florida and Cuba and Haiti. The scene in ""The Perfect Storm"" was brilliant. And, George Clooney and Wahlberg were perfect for their roles, because they were portraying NORMAL people. Wolfgang Peterson did a great job with William Wittliff's script. I also saw ""Das Boot"" when it was first released, but I didn't faint when I learned Peterson had directed them both. In fact, there were parts of ""Das Boot"" I didn't enjoy, like guys puking on themselves - but, that's the way sailors are, huh? I now have ""The Boat"" and enjoy is thoroughly.I loved ""Murph"" and Mastrantonio's character - also ""Sully"". I just got the DVD for this movie and watched it earlier tonight. It's got my 10, because it never fails to frighten me. Whatever Oscars it won, they were deserved. Folk who know nothing about the ocean and the risks people who sail it daily, they should definitely watch this movie....then give thanks and respect to those who WORK it daily....and gave their lives.....we're on dry land. Bravo! for ""The Perfect Storm""....9/28/06 - I watched ""the special features"" tonight: to those who made comments about 'throwing a little water on them"" should really watch them. Most of those scenes were shot on a fantastic stage with a huge tank of water, with machines that make the boats pitch, etc. So, all of the cast who were on the Andrea Gail were in great danger, not just one time but for the duration of the filming. Bravo to all !",The Perfect Storm
112,Shiva-11,The perfect storm movie.,8,22 June 2000,"The Perfect Storm:  Billy Tyne is a swordboat captain who's hit a patch of bad luck - while his colleagues have returned to port nearly bursting at the seams with fish, his hold is nearly empty.  Convinced that it is his turn to score the big haul, Tyne convinces his crew to go on one last run before the end of the season and heads for the North Atlantic.  He never figured Mother Nature into his plans.I remember reading about the Andrea Gail soon after ""The Storm of the Century"" hit the eastern seaboard.  It was only a matter of time before someone tried to bring this story to the big screen.  Thankfully, it was Wolfgang Petersen who did so - here he does for fishing what he did for submarine warfare in ""Das Boot"" - puts the viewer in the midst of the action and scares the hell out of them.I can say without exaggeration that I have never experienced a movie as stressful as this one (the friend I brought to the premiere was literally ill).  The movie starts out slowly and deliberately, gradually setting the stage for what is about to come.  Petersen utilizes several subplots to build the suspense: initially he focuses on the disappointment of the crew as they repeatedly fail to hit the motherlode.  Masterfully intercut with this are scenes documenting an idyllic sailing trip that turns ugly, and the Coast Guard attempts to rescue them.   Consequently, the tension, like the storm, continues to build to a crescendo, and never wanes.  The movie also feels real.I have been in twenty-foot seas once in my life, and that was more than enough for me (it was one of the few times I ever contemplated my own mortality).  Watching this movie brought it all back: the waves looked so real that it is often difficult to differentiate between the CGI and the real thing.   Also, I could feel the waves as they pounded relentlessly against the boat (the theatre I saw this in had a great sound system) and was deafened by the shrieking wind.  The experience, is, for lack of a better word, ferocious -  I kept everything to disintegrate in the onslaught.  However, special effects alone do not adequately convey the appropriate sense of danger.Many of the water scenes were actually shot in heavy seas - they managed to film in the tail end of a hurricane - adding to the realism (several members of the crew were regularly feeding the fish...). The actors faced additional dangers - Mark Wahlberg came perilously close to drowning, not once but twice, and was injured by one of the animatronic creatures.   Anyone expecting Clooney or Wahlberg to be glamorous will be sorely disappointed - they are earthy, and scraggly.  But more importantly, their performances ring true.  Indeed, all of the main characters deliver subtle, believable performances.I have never given a strong endorsement with an equally strong caveat - you must see this movie, but only if you can handle stress.  And yes I am serious on both counts.",The Perfect Storm
113,rhinocerosfive-1,a shipwreck is a terrible thing to waste,1,23 July 2007,"This is one of those movies in which the extraordinary looks reasonably real, and the mundane feels embarrassingly fake. Everything about this movie is not only predictable but forecast. Essentially, stupid people in a tired story take far too long to die. George Clooney and Marky Mark play dueling whiskers, William Fichtner is solid as always, and Wolfgang Petersen sleeps on the job.A disaster spectacle with fifteen minutes of spectacle is disastrous only if you have to sit through it. There's an hour and a half of foot-dragging on the most shameless crayon & cardboard elements - kid cries over his broken family, young couple plans a happy life together before tearfully parting at the dock, handsome captain rejects pretty captain in favor of the open sea - while, conversely, the action-spectacle stuff is brief and rushed. Lots of watching people try to get back into boats and helicopters, climbing ropes, spars, transoms. I mean no disrespect to the men who died in this storm. Probably the filmmakers didn't either. But best-laid plans should start with a script.Rent TOWERING INFERNO if you must. But don't do this. You've got your whole life ahead of you.",The Perfect Storm
114,kingofdanerds,Highly underrated film,9,21 October 2021,"I have came across numerous films in my time that I find to be criminally underrated. One such film is The Perfect Storm. This film was released in 2000 and is based off of the book of the same name (of which I have not read) and in turn was largely based off real events that occurred. The film was directed and produced by Wolfgang Petersen and stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The film would prove to be a success at the box office, making over $300 million against a budget of over $100 million. The film would see largely mixed reception and has not seen any sorts of critical reappraisal since it's release.After returning from an unsuccessful fishing run, the crew of the Andrea Gail head back out, leaving loved ones and such behind, not aware that the perfect storm awaits them.I seriously do not understand the hate for this film. I just do not. So the film is based off of a book which in turn was based off of real events that occurred. First off, haven't read the book. But, one can simply do some simple research to see what facts line up and such. But, I really do not need to. I am aware nobody knows what really happened and the film goes to creative liberties to fill in the unknown and I do not see a problem in that. It has been brought to my attention that the storm portrayed in the film is exaggerated. Which can be a problem for some but it never really bothered me too much. Right away, we see what life is like typically for the crew of the Andrea Gail. This builds up character for some but some crew members are vastly ignored in this film and there are not that many crew members at all. What makes it emotional for me as a viewer is the fact that we know what is going to happen and knowing that this actually happened to real people. It is truly heartbreaking. What makes me feel even worse is the fact that the actors in the film are all around fairly likeable actors like John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney. Once out at sea, we learn how hard the fishing business is. We feel the way the people in the film feel. When something happens in their favor, we fell the happiness and excitement right along with them. When there is tension onboard the Andrea Gail, you certainly feel it. Throughout the film we cut to other people being trapped in the storm. I have seen criticisms that this slows down the film a bit. Yes, I would rather see a film entirely about the crew of the Andrea Gail, but it does make sense to me here. Such a big storm is going to effect more than just one boat. So to me, it makes sense to show a bit of other people being effected by the storm. On the flipside, the time used with the other people could have easily been used to develop the other crewmates on the Andrea Gail. Not only is the film emotional, it is pretty suspenseful and thrilling and overall, entertaining to watch. Outside of the whole storm, we get a few suspenseful moments and some good thrills added. But once the storm hits (saying the storm comes is not a spoiler), everything is ramped up. The special effects really add to the suspense as well. It is obviously CG but it really amazes me how it all looked. Haven't had the chance to do any research on production and such, I always wonder how they filmed a lot of the on boat stuff with the storm and such. James Horner provides a fairly good score here. The calm music here is a bit reminiscent (to me at least) to Free Willy. Hey, it is just an opinion. The score often gets criticized for being overpowered but I think it is not and if it is, it blends in with all of the chaos and such going on. Once the film reaches it's end, it is truly heartbreaking albeit, happened too quick if you asked me.The Perfect Storm is a highly underrated film. It is probably one of the more emotional films I have watched in quite some time and I will gladly return to this film whenever.",The Perfect Storm

UK soap fans will free right at home as 90% of this part of the movie takes place in The Crows Nest bar.The second half of the movie deals with the fishing boat, a sailing boat and a helicopter - it's as spell binding as it sounds.

116,Rathko,Disappointing Disaster Movie,6,28 November 2005,"A disappointing movie, the cause of which can only really be laid at the feet of William Wittliff. His screenplay, despite a promising start, rapidly looses focus and direction until the storm becomes the lead character and the actors relegated to mere extras. Though a tradition of disaster movies, the decision to focus on several individuals rather than a central protagonist is a fatal error, not least because NONE of those characters are developed in any meaningful way and given anything approaching an identity. All we are left with are generic fisherman, generic coastguard, and a generic yacht crew in peril, and we care little for any of them or their fate beyond the superficial empathy created by a competent director and melodramatic score. The viewer is left with an immediate feeling of ""that's sad"", but has forgotten the movie and its characters before the DVD is back in its case.ILM do a very nice job of recreating the converging hurricanes, and the artistic and technical teams in general are excellent. But as is so often the case, a beautifully executed movie cannot compensate for a poorly structured screenplay populated by shallow characters.",The Perfect Storm
117,MF210,A Thrilling and Entertaining experience,8,11 October 2003,"My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. The Perfect Storm is one of those summer movies I crave for, something that is relentless and is not stupid or clumsy in its execution. The Perfect Storm was undoubtedly one of the best films of the summer of 2000. In fact, the Summer of 2000 was actually not a bad summer for movies, there were movies like Gladiator, X-Men, and the first Scary Movie. Sure there were movies I didnt like, for example Mission Impossible 2.
I am not a fan of Wolfgang Petersen, although the reason for that maybe I never saw Das Boot. I found Air Force One to be lacking many things, especially the intensity which is here. The Perfect Storm is not flawless, in fact the dialogue is kind of corny in areas. The Perfect Storm contains breathtaking visual effects. The waves are so real you we feel like your in the storm. The big wave which is the climax at the end is a magnificent piece of work. The Perfect Storm also has a score during the storm (most notably during the Andrea Gail Scenes) that contributes to the thrill of the experience. The performances are not bad. George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and the rest that make up the Andrea Gail crew all give credible performances. Diane Lane does a good job for what shes in. I had a hard time seeing Mary Mastrano (Dont know how to spell her last name) as Linda Greenlaw, she seems a bit too pretty to do this. Theres alot going on in The Perfect Storm, more people are involved during the Storm. While there scenes are not as thrilling as the Andrea Gail scenes they certainly have there thrills. Were more involved with the characters in the Andrea Gail sequences so we wont care as much what happens to these other characters. The Perfect Storm is a very entertaining two hours that rarely drags. Like I said, The Perfect Storm is not flawless but it contains enough intense moments for the viewer to be satisfied. Definitely worth watching.",The Perfect Storm
118,deadbull-95171,One of the best disaster movies,10,7 June 2021,"Towering inferno, Poseidon Adventure, the list is huge and goes WAY back, and usually the people are played as mannequins that slowly get immolated or crushed for our voyeuristic delight. They have a few lines, so we get the butcher the baker and the candlestick maker. What we don't usually get is any empathy creating depth, just plasticized people used as an excuse for a big explosion or wave or virus or alien attack or capsize etc.Not so here. A great cast with a good script create people you can relate to and this makes a big difference when the weather goes bad, to a surprising degree.The last version of Poseidon with Kurt Russell was likeable if you like Kurt, and he is a good actor, but he and Richard Dreyfus were 2 dimensional, like the rest of the cast, just plastic dolls dealing with a brick thrown in a bathtub. Lot's of CGI. Fake rescue helicopters usually seem to look the most ridiculousThe perfect storm integrates the human interest aspect deftly into the situational stuff. We all know what's coming, but are not bored, at least I wasn't, by the lead up to the impending mess, because of an intimacy created with the people, to the extent one is able to get involved with artificial electronically deployed images and words created by actors playing scripts.The storm is dramatic, the effects are extremely well done and believable, and since once the intensity begins, it's relentless, it's better to be on board with characters you have come to care about, within the context of surreality many of us have substituted for life. Ahh....... 2021. Not exactly like 1967.",The Perfect Storm
119,len-21,6 on a scale of 10,5,4 July 2000,"I would rate the sea scenes as the best I have ever seen. Many great epic films have created great sets. But, it is pretty difficult to recreate the ocean during a hurricane. Other films have tried, but nothing quite compares to Perfect Storm.Perfect Storm it may have been. Perfect movie, it wasn't. The first 45 minutes to 1 hour were mind-numbingly boring. It wasn't that it was bad, it just was completely uninspiring. If you like fish, seedy bars and grungy people then the first 45 minutes has something for you. Otherwise, you could EASILY come late and get 95% of the value of this movie.The other MAJOR problem I had was that <<<<SPOILER>>>> everyone on the boat dies! Ok, so it has a sad ending. That's not my favorite way to spend the day, but not every movie has a happy ending. My problem with it is that the entire second half the film is about the fears, successes, conflicts and bravery of the men on that ship. Unfortunately, though purported to be a true story, NOT ONE SINGLE SECOND OF THE EVENTS IS TRUE - at least as far as we know. How can we know, they are all dead. They didn't exactly leave a log. And, if they did, it is about 5,000 feet below sea level. What a joke!And, furthermore, it really PO'd me that one of the Coast Guardsmen who came to save them died in the process. Their arrogance and greed cost an innocent man his life. And, we are supposed to root for them? I don't think so.This was not a story worth making a movie out of. Some fishermen head out to sea.

Depiction of fishermens' emotional connect with their family is nice. The fishing scenes, the harbor looked real and felt as if I am one of them. Usually no one takes a movie on fishing or fisherman, and this movie is probably a tribute to all those fishermen who dies now and then after venturing out into the sea.The background music played during the climax survival scenes is just not a match, and moreover irritating. The graphics is good considering that this is a 2000 year movie. The performances looks very real, whether it is from George Clooney, or from Wahlberg or from rest of the folks. They made me feel as if they are no more celebrities, but real fishermen in deed.Overall - 8/10",The Perfect Storm

A more gripping movie.For the Junger fans I'd stick to the book.This movie does a good job of putting the audience into the action of the storm and it is a type of tribute to the Glauches. fisherman, but while its special effects will rock the theatre and while the sound effects will be in your face, the characters of the movie play third fiddle to the storm. They for the most part are card-board characters whom could easilly be replaced or forgotten.Oh course, this is the trap of the movie to begin with as the Storm is the stage and the nobody really knows what all was said in the true story.In all a good movie (the best of July 4, 2000)",The Perfect Storm

124,danielll_rs,Good but not great; you can't ask for much more,4,2 September 2000,"**GRADE: B- / 68**THE PERFECT STORM is the kind of film that couldn't have been much better, but is still not totally satisfying. You have action (sea storms, boats being destroyed, sharks), drama (deaths, tears, family affairs), romance (platonic love, a couple separated by the husband's duty). And you still leave the theater thinking that it is not a great film. Good, yes. But not something masterful or unforgettable. As a film based on a real story, THE PERFECT STORM doesn't take you to another world, but takes you to a showing of the complete fury of nature, something you had never seen before. Wow! If you want special effects, this film is for you. The scenes are so realistic that you feel you are on the storm with the fishermen. Water, water and water. Computers... What would we be without them? Well, a film like THE PERFECT STORM simply wouldn't exist. Director Wolfgang Petersen and the special effects creators should be applauded for such an amazing work as this. The audience liked and the film earned more than big hits as GLADIATOR and WHAT LIES BENEATH on its first weekend. And (what is better) lowing Mel Gibson's ego with THE PATRIOT.THE PERFECT STORM has more qualities (effective acting, a well prepared director, good tension), but has also problems. 1- The beginning is kind of slow and cliched. I know its objective is to introduce the characters, but it could have been less talkative and sentimental. 2- Some situations aren't needed. In fact, two of them: the scene where the shark attacks Whalberg and the one where John C. Reilly is pulled by the fishing line, and the guys have to save him from drowning. If the point was to show that the guys made a perfect team together, even with their differences, and they were not blamed for the disaster, it was a little stupid. 3- Despite a long introduction to develop the characters, they weren't three dimensional. I would call them ""bi-dimensional characters"". They change their way of thinking or their way of acting in a blink of eyes. Taking those three problems, THE PERFECT STORM is a good film. As I said, I loved the realism  and the tension of the second half. George Clooney, Mark Whalberg and John C. Reilly on the sea, and Diane Lane and the families on ground help to keep the emotions vivid. Many people complained that the ending is too sentimental, but oddly I liked it. I wasn't expecting that, because I haven't read the book and didn't know the whole story. Now I recognize the courage of those fishermen, even if many details of the real story were changed to write the screenplay for a big budget Hollywood movie. (Obviously it was)The veredict: THE PERFECT STORM has its flaws, but it is a worth seeing, more for its amazing special effects than for its screenplay and character development. There were better films in this year's US summer (X-MEN, GLADIATOR) and worse (GONE IN 60 SECONDS, DINOSAUR), but good is what this movie is. Now, what would you expect from a $110 million dollars flick? An unexplained rain of frogs at the end? John C. Reilly was there too, by the way, if you get my point. Poor man!",The Perfect Storm

The literate directors, who once brought us audience pleasing, soul-satisfying stories, seem to have vanished the way of the American Bison.  What has emerged is an empty, soulless presentation of eye-popping scenes tied to nothing at all.             Here, we are introduced to meaningless characters not developed enough for us to feel an affinity.   When they move on into the insipid, formless story, we find ourselves impatiently waiting for the only possible satisfaction, the remarkable visual presentation of the storm with its exciting rescue scenes.          It might be that Frank Capra's dictum to filmmakers, `Give em something to put in their pocket to take home with 'em ' is now truly passé.   We leave the theater feeling like we just saw an awesome fireworks, but one that afterward we scarcely think about, and one essentially not worth two or more hours of our lives, for we have gained nothing.

When the boat finally leaves dock, anyone would think they are flying the first mission to Mars, such is the ridiculous over the top emotion of the whole thing.

Oh dear, the characters continue to act in the most stereotype manner, I surprised they didn't throw in the standard token black man and make him save a crew member.Anyway the funniest part of the movie was when the anchor broke free.  GC decided the only way to deal with this problem was to climb up the end of a bouncing poll, with a welding torch, to cut the anchor, in the middle of the worst storm ever, absolutely hilarious.Anyway, I assumed someone survived and that was how the producers knew the events that took place, ah, no.

127,ScottAmundsen,Kind of a waste of time.,2,9 July 2019,"This is a tough movie to write about. On the one hand, the characters are well-cast and well-developed, the plot line is plausible (whether it actually happened that way there is no way to know and it does not really matter), and the basic conflict is brought to the screen intact.On the other hand, we come into this movie knowing far too much for there to be anything remotely like suspense. We know that the fishing trawler ANDREA GAIL ran headlong into a three-storm cycle that pretty much ate up everything in its path. How it happened? Not a clue. And that makes this film a bit of a waste of time; it has no suspense to speak of and the only character that can actually bring a note of suspense to the proceedings is fellow captain Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, really the only actor who creates a note of tension; it is a pity she does not have more screen time), who attempts to warn Captain Billy Tyne of the ANDREA GAIL that he is headed ""right into the middle of the monster"" a message it is not known whether he ever received because at some point the radio has gone dead.TPS was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a guy who is good at this sort of thing; among his major successes are DAS BOOT (film and mini-series), OUTBREAK, ENEMY MINE, and AIR FORCE ONE. The only mistake he made here was taking a true event and trying to turn it into what otherwise would have made a superb fiction film.One other reviewer wrote of this title, ""it's a movie, just a movie.

The first hour, before the waterworks, is ironically the strongest segment of the film. The characters are not explored in depth, but the screenplay does give us time to know them, and to see them as human beings. Although predictable and cliched, ""The Perfect Storm"" allows us to sympathize with them. This is due largely to the efforts of a solid cast, especially Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly. George Clooney is decent, but his character is rather two-dimensional, often coming across as some sort of megalomaniac.Alas, it was during the much-touted second hour of the film where I lost interest.

Half a dozen regular fishermen (well regular except for the fact that one looks like George Clooney and one looks like Mark Wahlberg) set out catch swordfish and get caught up in a monster storm. Essentially you get one hour of build up and characterisation and one hour of the storm. In this respect it is a very conventional film and it is quite shameless in the way it manipulates emotions to get you to care about the characters, and even though you can see every last scrap of the manipulative elements you do care about the characters.What is so special about this film though is the storm sequences which are an absolute knockout from beginning to end. I don't remember ever being so on the edge of my seat in a film (Petersen's earlier Das Boot came pretty close though) even though I knew what the ending was. Henceforth a film's grippingness can only be measured against The Perfect Storm. You go in being prepared to see big seas and men being thrown about on sets on rollers but when you are watching it you just can't believe how awesome the scenes are that you are watching. And it just goes on and on and on – bigger, louder, more outrageous.You know that you must be watching models or larger mock-ups in some of the scenes. You know the action must have been filmed in tanks under controlled conditions. You know that you must be watching mechanical effects and computer-generated effects and blue screen work. These techniques are the only way that a lot of this film could be made. Yet I could not see the seams at any point in this film. I could not see which were models, which effects, which blue screens. The whole damn thing is so completely seamless that every single scene looks authentic. Now I don't care what you say but even otherwise excellent films like Titanic and Gladiator have some truly awful effects – in both of the films mentioned the worst effects are the large scale flyovers of huge computer generated sets – they look good but not good enough to convince me.George Lucas has an avowed intent of making films which seamlessly blend live action, animated characters and CGI effects and we all know how tragically he failed to achieve this in the Phantom Menace, one of the worst films in the history of cinema. The Perfect Storm though succeeds even though some of the characters and conveyor-belt script are as cardboard as Star Wars characters. The action and the effects are just that good that they run the film and as a viewer you are completely swept away by them. Lucas should be so lucky – he should obviously give up directing immediately and let the real innovators in ILM, the guys who did the effects for this movie, take over.If The Perfect Storm doesn't excite you as a piece of film making, even if the storyline is by-the-numbers, then I find it hard to believe you like films at all and you would be better off reading a book.",The Perfect Storm
137,kylehodgdon,Awesome Movie That Is Quite Memorable,9,19 December 2009,"I thought that ""The Perfect Storm"" was really nicely done and was a very memorable movie. This came out in the middle of 2000, when it seemed as though many movies tried to have that ""new millennium"" feel to them. However, ""The Perfect Storm"" did not go that route. Instead, this movie took a simple concept and made it into a really nice story with a group of guys who tried to beat the odds, first with their amazing haul, and second as they faced off against Mother Nature.I am from a small coastal town in Maine, so this movie had a personal feel to me as well. I think that they did a good job in creating the coastal, fishing town feel.I also thought Clooney and Wahlberg did a very good job in their respective roles. Clooney's final lines in the film about getting out of there are ones I can still remember vividly ten years later. And, of course, the scene with the giant wave in the end in very, very memorable.I know that the movie did not follow the book to a T, but that really did not matter to me. It is really worth seeing.",The Perfect Storm

In that state I really did not enjoy the movie, so when I saw it was showing on TV the other night I thought I would give it another chance. Well my state of sobriety had not affected my judgement and I still really did not enjoy the movie. This the story of the crew of the fishing ship the 'Andréa Gail' who become trapped in the titular 'Perfect Storm' is apparently based around real life events. Which for those of you familiar with story know to be complete hogwash. We have a stellar cast here led by George Clooney as Captain Billy Tyne, and supported in the character roles by Mark Walberg, John C Reilly and William Fitchner. The problem here is they all give over the top actors trying to be everyman performances. It is hard to be taken in by any of the performances. This is also not helped by the hammy directing from Wolfgand Peterson (cab he really have given us the stupendously good 'Das Boat?) The film also suffers from a terrible score from James Horner that attempts to drag you to places of emotional places the film does not warrant. I for one will never experience this movie again.",The Perfect Storm
140,Ace-38,A stellar cast delivers a stellar performance.,8,1 January 2001,"It is inescapable fact that it is very difficult to take real-life events and translate them into an interesting and thrilling movie.  Ron Howard perfected the art with ""Apollo 13"" and now Wolfgang Petersen continues on with ""The Perfect Storm"".   This story of Gloucester, MA. fishermen who go out for one last try at a big payoff in a slumping season packs quite a wollup once they get caught up in an event that had never before been recorded:  the perfect storm.  From there, you have to suspend belief just a bit and drink in the events occurring aboard the Andrea Gail.  It's not tough, as the cast delivers them perfectly.George Clooney may have played his signature role as Capt. Billy Tyne, skipper of the ill-fated Andrea Gail on that fateful day in 1991.  Clooney comes off as neither overly glamorous, or bigger than life, but as a simple common man just trying to break his fishing slump and bring home a big payday for his boss, his crew, and himself.  When George relaxes and puts himself into a role, he is better off, and Capt. Tyne is the pinnacle of that for him.Mark Wahlberg comes on board as Bobby Shatford, a rookie fisherman who is trying to make a better life for himself and his girlfriend Chris (nicely played by Diane Lane).  Bobby is the only character given equal depth to Billy and comes off with the same impression:  a good guy who was trying hard to make a better life.  Very nicely done here as well.Supporting cast is good, John C. Reilly as Dale ""Murph"" Murphy, William Fichtner as David ""Sully"" Sullivan, a late arrival to the Andrea Gail's crew, Michael Ironside as the profit first Bob Brown.  All of these stellar characterizations and serve brilliantly to put you into Gloucester of 1991.Wolfgang Petersen has created a gripping film, full of chillingly realistic special effects.  He skillfully took Sebastian Junger's novel and tweaked it to fit the confines of the motion picture screen.  Casting and acting by all involved was perfect and you never once feel like anything is overacted or overly dramatic, just that you are somehow involved with the fear that had to have been involved on that night.4 1/2 out of 5",The Perfect Storm

For a film based on a true story, the characters looked very stereotyped and the few ""funny scenes"" weren't funny at all. Still, when I first looked at my watch, an hour and a half had gone by, while I expected 20 minutes or so.The finale however was way too long, not impressive enough and not what I expected it to be. Still, the movie was thrilling enough to make it worth seeing. Too bad they had to put such a corny end to it, which spoiled part of the thrill.

I heard all the commentaries, I saw the commercials on TV, I went to the theater to see what they announce it's an epic movie full of emotions and full of good cinema... and here is what I found:a) Special effects not so perfect as they say.b) A sailor called George Clooney who only needed a stethoscope to be a perfect Ace from ""E/R"" (1984). Perhaps he thank that by using a strange grimace here and there he would become a perfect sailor...? Almost the whole movie it looks like he's posing for the girls at the other side of the screen. Is it perhaps that he was told to do that...? John Hawkes is a hundred times better as a sailor than him. A lot of people won't like what I'll say, but Clooney is for me an awful actor. While Paul Newman is a good-looking man and also a brilliant actor (try to imagine him (of course, a young Paul) in the role of the captain...), George Clooney is just a good-looking man.c) A child actor who does not convince at all. OK, he's only a child, but this is Hollywood at its best!d) A, let's say, strange story ending. When the film finished I was just waiting for another twenty minutes, so I said to myself, is that really all of it...? Of course, I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't say any more details.e) A suggested telepathy phenomenon out of place in my opinion. I won't say where it appears to avoid this commentary from being a spoiler.These are, among others, some of the things I dislike. This movie is nothing to write home about. It's entertaining, but it's mediocre. Perhaps the great mistake about it was the movie itself. In Twister (1996), for example, you see people running away from the wind cone, you see a bright day turning into a dark green sky, there is always something new to catch your eye and keep you interested. In this film we just see the giant waves here and there, and more waves, and more waves. When you see one, you have seen them all. If that's not enough, the actors don't do their best, and the plot is so simple that you wonder if there is really a plot behind the scenes. And now I'll be sincere: I went to the cinema to see special effects, just that, and even so I was disappointed.My rating is 6 out of 10 (not much for a blockbuster).",The Perfect Storm

I only wish it had been on TV and not the box office.First, as a musician I think the deep majestic music was totally gratuitous. You would think these fisherman were fighting the Battle of Britain.On another level, the characters were shallow and that applied to the mawkish script as well.OK, well, Hollywood almost at its worst, but not quite.The monster waves were impressive. I wonder what tank they created them in.This film took itself much too seriously and although there may have been some human drama to enact here, it ended up doing the SOAPY Box routines.Was hard to sit through.",The Perfect Storm

147,A-Ron-2,"Not a bad film, but not a great one",7,5 July 2000,"Ultimately, what hurts this movies is that it tries to be too compassionate to the crew of the actual Andrea Gail (which is fine, considering that their families are still alive, but this is the problem with making a film based on fact too quickly).  Essentially, the script writers were so afraid of offending anyone that they made the characters completely 2 dimensional.  I just didn't really care about any of them, I was much more concerned about the actual crew during the real storm back in '91.  This is a problem. Fiction is supposed to touch us, but this film really doesn't.  It makes the perfunctory nods toward pathos, but never really says or does anything (although the shot after the sinking of the ship is pretty depressing).That being said, I do not regret seeing it.  The storm sequences are exciting, the characters are NOT terrible, just kind of shallow.  However, the storm sequences do not build properly to a resounding conclusion that such a movie should try for.  I enjoyed the film for its strengths, and its weaknesses did not, IMO, sink it.Go see the film if it looks like something you would enjoy.  Chances are you will.",The Perfect Storm
148,darkjosh,"Seaworthy Due to Grandiose Special Effects, Adequate Script",7,11 November 2000,"Wolfgang Petersen's The Perfect Storm is a special effects laden, thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride whose script, thought not exactly original or inventive, is put to good use by its more than capable cast.George Clooney stars as Billy Tynes, Captain of the Andrea Gail.  He's a fisherman who has been run into a dry spell, so he decides to trek into further into the ocean, hoping to find better catch and takes along fellow crewmen Mark Whalberg, John C. Reilly, William Fitchner, and John Hawkes. At the same time, there are three gigantic storms that are converging along their route, and, of course, team up to form The Perfect Storm, an unrelenting, brutal storm of overwhelming proportions.The Perfect Storm lives up to its title, containing some of the most fluid, spectacular storm effects ever put on celluloid: it's very difficult to tell when we're looking at CGI and when we're looking at actual storm footage. Recently, however, Hollywood has attempted to compensate for the holes and overall lack of substance in their scripts with an overload of special effects.  This film at least attempts to make the audience care about it's characters, showing each of the crew mate's friends and lovers bidding them farewell during the film's first half-hour, before plunging them into the perilous though beautifully created depths of the hellish stormfront.The talented cast carries the story well.  Clooney is a completely underrated actor, and his muted performance here may be overshadowed by Whalberg, but Clooney's character comes off as the stronger between the two in retrospect: Whalberg may love his girlfriend, but Clooney has a much deeper passion for the sea.  Reilly and Fichtner do their best with their cliched material as two feuding hotheads. Thankfully, The Perfect Storm doesn't forget what makes films truly emotional and memorable: solid characters and good storytelling.  While it may not be a complex drama, it's sympathetic characters, brisk pacing, along with some breath-taking visuals make it a top-notch, adrenaline-pumping action film.7 out of 10",The Perfect Storm

Now this isn't just a film its a ride. I was having trouble walking when I came out. There is so much swaying by the cameras and so much water your totally engulfed in the film and actual feel like your there, lost at sea. The film starts off as a drama, to develop characters and give the story some substance. But let me tell you it all stops when the storm hits. Unlike most action films where the thrills come in  tons that are short in length, this film's sequence last nearly an hour of the film. There are many different area of the storm seen including a daring Coast Guard rescue. This film just hits you almost non stop and just when you thinks it's over, it's hits you hard, real hard. The Perfect Storm gets a 10. It's a film that goes out and does what it's suppose to do, get likeable characters across to the audience, have some good dialogue, and thrill the theater so much that everyone comes out feeling sea sick.

It was emotionally and visually fulfilling, and you can connect with the characters more, because it's based on a true story.  Most disaster films don't give you enough time to connect with the characters and actually feel bad when they die.  Anyway, a lot of the drama takes place on land as well in the sea.  George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg did a very good job as the 2 main members on the Andrea Gail, and so did the rest of the cast.  The visuals were also amazing, too...I felt like I was there, going over the waves and hoping for the best.  Even though you know that the boat never came back in real life, somehow you can find yourself left with that feeling that you hope they can make it back to shore, and it's not like shouting, ""Oh, you're never gonna make it!

Never had such a meteorological event occurred.Much has been written about this film's special effects in their portrayal of the stormy seas, and these effects are truly incredible.  Perhaps more importantly, the film follows Junger's book in its portrayal of Gloucester and its community: A one industry town, where the residents feel obligated to the incredibly dangerous deep-sea fishing industry, even though they have lost so many of their citizens.The cast is solid: Clooney fits well as Billy Tyne, the Andrea Gail's captain, and although he doesn't have a New England accent, there isn't much lost in that.  Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane are both very good as the only characters with any romance in their lives, and we truly feel the love and hope that they have for each other.  John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, and the ever-tough Michael Ironside (is he EVER a good guy ?) round out the cast.Junger's book was a fascinating and important story to tell, and Petersen has directed a fine film about man's battle against the sea and its consequences.",The Perfect Storm

154,Manthorpe,oh man,4,13 September 2004,"The film means well, it's just an embarrassingly contrived failure that makes the real story look stupid and utterly pointless. First off, I'd like to say that anyone dumb enough to think that they can head directly into a hurricane on a small fishing boat and make it through unscathed, and just for some money, is entirely stupid and would probably succumb to the survival of the fittest theory sometime shortly thereafter if the storm did not kill them. People that attempt such things usually don't live too long. I guess some of my dislike for this film comes from my dislike of the real ""heroes"", I think they're stupid, with all due respect. But, I have to admit, maybe some of this dislike has been projected onto them unfairly and my opinion might be tarnished by this raw and pure definition of trite cinema. I rejoiced when they met their fate.trite: 1. Lacking power to evoke interest through overuse or repetition; hackneyed. 2. Frayed or worn out by use. And there you have it. There never was much of a story to begin with, some fools died on a boat, but no one really knows the details....so the filmmakers were forced to pull the rest out of their rears. Too bad they didn't look to see if it didn't stink first. Everything in this film from the characters, the minor conflicts, the dialogue...it's all been done about three billion time before in three billion other movies. And where it gets bad is where you can tell even the creators knew that they didn't have much of a story to go on and decided to throw some weak conflicts here and there to keep the audience from falling asleep. A shark on board, oh no! Man overboard, oh no! The conflict onboard that is resolved after one of the guys saves his ""enemy"", aww, how cute and totally original. The lovesick lovers left behind, awww, how sad. The moronicly stubborn captain and the men who mindlessly worship him, hmmm haven't seen that before. I got sick of hearing ""Skip"" being said after about the hundredth time...almost as if they were in the military and addressing a superior as ""Sir"". And the captain that can't bear to leave his boat, idiot. Another thing that's gay is how excitable the crew is. They catch some fish and it's as if they won the biggest lottery jackpot of all time. It's silly. The acting itself isn't too terrible, there just was never much to work with. The whole thing isn't helped by simply the gayest ending of all time. 'I have this dream'The only good thing about this film is the special effects of the storm itself, which are mildly amusing. Other than that, this is a MST 3000 candidate for sure. As a matter of fact, I watched this film with the sole intention of ripping it while watching it, which was amazingly easy to do. It almost does it to itself. What it all culminates into is a below average, over-budgeted summer blockbuster and nothing more. Watch this film to see how to make a movie suck. 4/10",The Perfect Storm

I thought the characters were interesting, even though there isn't a lot of character buildup, and we cared about them. Still the highlight of the movie is the special effects and they're done well. It builds up suspense and then throws it right at you with a spectacular looking hurricane.

I intend no disrespect to the real people who died in that incident by any of my following comments. This review has to do only with the movie's handling of the story.This movie was ridiculous. Even my sentimental wife, whose favorite movie is Sound of Music, was laughing at the overly dramatic set-ups of the movie's characters before they took their fateful trip. She actually started spouting cliched dialog in a few scenes. dialogue that was more or less what the characters then said. And we both mocked the movie's ""theme"" music, which was the same 6-7 notes played over and over and over and over, as often as possible.Perfect Storm hits you over the head (then smashes you in the stomach, then knees you in the groin) with the thought that being a swordfish captain/crew is in your blood ... a poetic existence ... being at one with yourself and the sea. It essentially ignores any common sense on behalf of the characters and also overlooks the fact that this is a group of people who seem to have made one bad decision after another in their lives and who are doomed to be sitting penniless, toothless and alone at the local crappy bar as they age and die at age 52. There were almost NO redeeming characteristics in this group of seamen, and they sure as heck weren't very smart.So, when the storm hits, do you care what happens? Not really. We kept thinking about the *real* men who died, and what they went through, and we felt bad for them. But these doofuses in the movie were just asking for it.The one group of characters who were easier to empathize with were the rescue crews. Those scenes dew the viewer in and served to make you appreciate brave people who do very tough jobs. It also made you even more annoyed at the sword boat crew that put the rescuers in the difficult position they were in.Finally, the much ballyhooed special effects were basically limited to shots of big waves in the background, and, finally, the shot we all saw in the trailer and commercials where the ship hits the monster wave. Very little variety, very little of interest once you get used to the waves.

159,amiranda-39274,Shes Not Letting Us Out: Deep Analysis,8,6 August 2020,"I have watched this movie almost every year since i was a kid, and I never get tired of it. My dad is a fishing nut, he always takes me and my siblings on fishing trips, like deep sea fishing off the Mexican coast, and he loves watching professional fishing shows, like river monsters. So its no wonder that this movie is a personal favorite of his, and we watch it every year on his birthday.The characters are well done in this film, the entire beginning dedicates itself to making you sympathize with the fishermen and their families, and when the 6 men are on the boat, we are treated to even more character development. Even the characters who don't get much time in the movie, like the 2 women and guy on the private yacht, or the air force rescue team, or even the families of the fishermen, waiting for their return. You relate and care about these characters, and it proves to be very effective later, when the dangers begin to occur. I'm not a big fan of George Clooney, but this is my favorite movie of his. Also i do feel stealing attention from the main cast, to show the struggles of the air force and other people trapped in the storm is odd, but i enjoy it because it makes this movie more expansive and not a single story about a crew of a fishing boat, but a story about the wraith of nature and especially the sea.The atmosphere is very heavy, you feel like your on a fishing boat, and that you are in the middle of the storm, and that you are at the mercy of the sea.
The music, my God the music is like a character itself, it is both heartwarming and haunting, it enhances every scene it's in, making the mundane feel more grand, and the horrific that much more scarier. The accidents and catastrophes are spectacular, like the shark scene, the hook in the hand, and the ultimate climax with the storm and the giant wave. Like the storm this movie builds and builds up until the bitter end, and while it does have a sad ending , the movie still ends beautifully.There is some excellent commentary on how dangerous an occupation it is to professionally fish. Watching these men risk so much just for fish is sad but inspiring. The dialogue is rich as well as the undertones in some of the conversations such as the undertones of the pride of mankind, the greed and demands of American culture, the striving to always push forward more than ever before, the magnificence of Gods creation and the power of nature itself.Every time i go on a fishing trip, waking up early to take off at 5 Am, i feel the breeze of the sea on my face, I always hear the iconic music of this movie playing in my head, i think that feeling of wonder and respect for the sea, is why me and my dad relate so much to this movie. This is still one of my favorite sailing/fishing/ disaster storm movies, and in my opinion it has stand the test of time . Yes, the story is not 100% accurate, but thats why its "" inspired "" by a true story. This is one of those movies that display human courage and sacrifice, and mans defiance against the fury of nature. ""Is There Anything Better In the World"" .

I was beginning to wonder if the crew of the Andrea Gail were ever going to cast off, or if they would spend the entire movie hanging out at the Crows Nest bar.  In retrospect, it's too bad they didn't.From the moment the doomed sword fisher gets underway until the breathtaking conclusion, The Perfect Storm is about as intense as a movie can be.  The storm scenes are nothing short of spectacular, the characters are well developed and the true story is completely engrossing.Having seen a two hour documentary (History Channel's ""The Killer Storm"") about the actual events, I was impressed by how closely the plot followed real life.

161,flickjunkie-3,Enjoyable and Unpredictable Fun.,7,25 December 2000,"I was desperate to see this. It looked like big, fun entertainment and I am a huge fan of Wolfgang Petersen. The Perfect Storm definitely delivers entertainment, and while it may not be Petersen's best, I enjoyed myself.The plot tells the story of the Andrea Gail, which is shown in the beginning moments as coming in from a trip at sea, carrying with it a load of fish that is less than satisfying to the owner of the boat. This puts the boat's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), under the added pressure of making a better catch the next trip. He is soon given an ultimatum: he must leave on a trip the following day and bring back a bigger catch if he wants to keep his position as captain. So it's off to sea again for the crew, but not before we are given a warming glance at each one's life on land. Their luck looks like it's running out, so they venture further out into the Atlantic to increase their find. While they are at sea, three storm systems, one of which is a hurricane, begin to move towards one another, and will soon collide directly in the path of the Andrea Gail's return back to port. Tyne gives his crew a choice: they can run away from the storm, or head right into it and attempt to make it back home. The stand-out performers are Mark Wahlberg (who, sadly, is apparently going to be a Razzie front-runner this year for this very film) and George Clooney, they show us better skills than they did in Three Kings, and Diane Lane and John C. Reilly make for a lovely supporting cast. The script is adapted from Sebastian Junger's excellent novel, and it matches up to its quality. All these things are good, but it is the visual effects that are really the best thing about the movie. We are thrown violently into the heart of the storm, first in a toe-clenchingly exciting matter, but near the end of the film, it becomes tiring to watch Clooney and co. continuously scream at the raging water, but there is still a lot of engaging thrills to make up for it.Some strong, unpredictable entertainment for audiences who aren't easily seasick.I rate The Perfect Storm 7 out of 10.",The Perfect Storm
162,ksheimsoth,Definitely a disaster movie people should watch,8,30 April 2020,"-The music was absolutely a star.
-The characters had very unique interactions and depth compared to many interactions nowadays. Characters got mad at their loved ones, grew to like people they didn't like, and actually had developing character.
-The effects were astonishing I think for the time.
-The effort put into this movie by the director and cast is amazing.
-It made me even think of what it's like to drown and how horrible an experience that would be.
-A good, disturbing look at what it might feel like to be a fisherman and the dangers of the work.-Held out a little bit",The Perfect Storm
163,DorianWynHowells,"""Hold on tight!!""",9,17 January 2002,"I waited a long time before I actually persuaded myself to watch this film. The trailer didn't do much for me, and I hated Mark Whalberg at the time, so, you can imagine why I didn't see it or rent it or anything - I became one of these sad people who berate a film without having seeing it!!!! Silly me!This film is VERY good, and as I am slightly soppy when I hear James Horner music (Braveheart anyone?), I howled (cried!) in this film! I recently, yesterday!, bought this on DVD and cried in the opening sequence!! Maybe it was because I knew how it all ended, and how dangerous fishing at sea can be! It made me think a lot about these guys' lives. It's also based on a true story!The acting is of a very high standard, and I can actually tolerate Mr Wahlberg! but it's Clooney's movie, he is electric as the skipper of the boat.The SFX are very very convincing, I wish now I'd seen this on the big screen - well you can't have it all eh? - because this would really have had me squirming in my seat! The helicopter rescue sequence is a very well constructed piece and shows us just how brave those guys are.
You have to see this film to really appreciate it, no review, no matter how good, can describe the feeling you will have watching these guys go head to head with one of the most deadliest forces on Earth - water! It's true that water/sea has claimed so many lives, and this film pays respect and gratitude to them, whoever and wherever they may be!Oh, and once the credits roll at the end, and if your still crying, listen to the song, and I mean listen to the WORDS!!! Oh my god! Enjoy!9/10",The Perfect Storm
164,Charles-31,"Awful, awful, awful...",2,18 July 2001,"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's not as bad as, say, Battlefield Earth.  But, it was really awful.  How many things can I say bad about it?Cliches abound.  You know when they enter the bar there will have to be a fight.  The poor women wanting their husbands to give up this life.  The ""I can't believe you're going out again instead of staying with me"".  George Clooney actually says ""I'm a fisherman, it's what I do""!The worst problem is the total lack of plot.  Men go fishing, storm hits. That's about all there is to it.  Okay, so it's a really bad storm with some occasionally good effects, but the boat-meets-storm plot has been done a thousand times, generally much better.  Nothing about the presentation made this ""storm of the century"" seem any worst than any other bad movie storm.The entire first 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut with no effect on the film at all.  It serves to develop personal relationships with the ""loved ones back home"" who you promptly forget (other than Clooney's gal). They do nothing for the rest of the film other than watch TV of the storm. Why did we care about the boat owner at all?Then, there's the fishing ""subplot"".  Okay, maybe we use that as an excuse to go into the storm, but it was pretty weak.  Then there are the myriad of flaws in the character actions and nautical activities.  Nobody seemed to want to rig the ship for the storm.  When we get a calm, nobody tries to take advantage of it to batten down.  People don't always wear lifelines.  Lifelines break.  Lots of drama, but not very real.I was not really impressed with the effects.  They were often so heavy handed they looked fake, and every shot of spotlights on CGI waves looked very fake.",The Perfect Storm
165,johanleupen,Disappointing. Overall only mildly entertaining. Overlong.,6,18 July 2000,"A strong beginning but after that it only gets worse. The mid-section is overlong and doesn't add to the story. The ending is too sentimental. Good actors deliver a poor performance (notably Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, she's excellent in the Abyss). Clooney can't do much with his character (he's too cold). The special effect are convincing of course, but these days it takes more than that for a movie to stand out.",The Perfect Storm
166,Steven Reynolds,Tasteless,5,5 July 2000,"A fine example of what happens when real events are tortured into the shape of a Hollywood blockbuster.  Corny and inaccurate characterization, fictitious events, textbook plotting, and James Horner's typically inane score are all called upon to wring sympathy from the audience and to while away the first hour until the storm - the only reason for this film's existence - actually hits.  When it does, it's amazing.  Rendered in mind-blowing CGI, it is utterly spectacular.  But this very spectacle actually works against the film: as depicted, the storm is so fierce and so realistic that you simply cannot believe anyone would even be able to STAND UP on the boat, let alone climb atop the bridge to fix the antenna, attempt to board up the windows, or have time for heartfelt goodbyes - not with the ship lurching at what looks like 89 degrees in 300 knot winds with 4000 cubic liters of water crashing onto the deck every three seconds.  It was just too much to take.  Sure, it looks great.  But is that the only point? Maybe in this market, at this time of year, it is.In any case, there's something a little tasteless about the whole affair. The film is based on true story.  Real people died.  To embellish their tragedy with spurious story elements, imaginary conflicts, and fantasized romances as a means of packaging 60 minutes of CGI for the 'event film' summer market - and then to have the gall to promote it as a 'true story' - may well be a savvy bit of marketing, but it strikes me as more than a little distasteful.  It dishonors the memory of those who died by turning their tragedy into a Saturday night's entertainment for the rest of us.  But I guess that's Hollywood.",The Perfect Storm
167,mercury-26,Almost perfect,7,4 July 2000,"Wolfgang Petersen set out to create a ""real"" experience when he took the job of directing this film. He succeeds in almost every sense of the word. Loving attention has been given to the characters, the work of a fisherman, life in Gloucester, and most importantly, to the Storm itself. When you're watching it, you're ""there,"" even if the scene consists only of people sitting on stools at the Crow's Nest, talking.  On rare occasions, the dialogue itself seems forced, though, like it's people talking in a movie and not in a bar. A minor detail.Because ""Storm""'s creators wanted us to get to know these men and their families well before setting sail, the film takes a long time to really get moving. Once it does, though, you're grateful you know them as well as you do. The swordfishing scenes--if these guys never swordfished before, which most of them probably have not, I couldn't tell (Markie Mark pulling the insides out of a big swordfish is about as shocking as a movie gets)--shooting in Gloucester, where it all happened, they knew they'd never be allowed to fake it.Whether it was intentional I have no idea, but what Petersen brings across with the Andrea Gail crew is a sense of true displacement--the overwhelming feeling that you're supposed to be somewhere else. We've all been in these situations, though none as perilous as this one. It's like leaving for work, getting halfway there, and realizing you've forgotten the report you'd worked for days on and is due today. You have no choice: you have to go back and get it and make yourself late for work. You retrieve the report and drive the exact same route back to work and there it is: this powerful sense that this is not the way things were supposed to go. The whole day is now thrown off completely.These fishermen are having the ultimate bad day. Their captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney in his best performance ever), has just brought them back from a disappointing two months of fishing. Tyne's boss (Michael Ironside) knows just what buttons to push and convinces Tyne to return to sea. This is an easy decision for Tyne--all he has is the sea. He's divorced and his only love is his job. He'd do it for free. His crew is another story altogether. Sure, they love fishing, but they also need the money desperately. Swordfishing is a gamble. Like many industries, you put in a lot of time and resources into it, making many sacrifices, without knowing what the return will be. Tyne's no guts, no glory'-type speech convinces them to go along for the ride again--only days after they've returned from the last run.From the beginning of their journey, the crew members pour the pressure on their captain to make it worth their while. This is a last-minute, unplanned trip. They're not supposed to be there. Before the storm even hits, the bad karma surrounds them like fog: besides having even worse luck catching swordfish than their last run, one bizarre small disaster after another happens along the way. This approach is what makes William Wittliff's script so great. He uses these incidents to build the intensity, capping it off with the famed super-storm.I can honestly say that this is the best work I've ever seen from ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Never have special effects been more crucial to a story and executed so effectively. The storm scenes--when the lightning flashes, briefly revealing mountains of black waves--are at once beautiful and terrifying.Petersen brings it all together nicely. He puts his characters (and from what I've heard, his actors as well) through hell. As the voyage takes a turn from being an ill-advised journey to transport 64,000 pounds of swordfish back across the Atlantic to being a desperate struggle for survival, you can see it on the characters' faces: they've never been this close to death--and they're loving every minute of it. How can we not do the same? The best way to pay homage I can think of.Grade: A-",The Perfect Storm
168,robsellke,"A fascinating tale of deep-sea fishermen, but with a few weaknesses",7,15 July 2000,"""The Perfect Storm"" takes viewers to several places they have probably never seen: a deep-sea fishing rig, and a storm-tossed, mountainous sea.  The story is of Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and his crew of down-on-their-luck fishermen on THE ANDREA GAIL, a deep-sea long-liner swordfish boat.  The crew sets out again, in hopes of catching a good crop of fish, way out on ""The Flemsih Cap"" a stretch of water 1300 miles from shore, nearly off the charts.  On the way back, they face what is known as The Perfect Storm, a weather phenomenon where a hurricane collides with a gale and is fed by cold Canadian jet streams, to make a catastrophic storm. The crew decides to risk going through to save their huge harvest of swordfish, but also run the risk of losing their lives.  This movie is fantastic, except for some flaws, like a poor performance from Murph's son and Bobby's girlfriend, and some glorification that probably didn't happen. But the fantastic plot and setting bring this movie life that nothing could diminish completely.",The Perfect Storm
169,NewDivide1701,The perfect failure,1,17 November 2005,"This movie was terrible! Along with the Aviator, it is categorized as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The first half of the movie is 100% forgettable and pointless. It's about developing relationships, having a good time (excluding watching this movie of course), going to bars, so on and so forth, to where the fishermen eventually say their goodbyes and cast off.The second half isn't much better. It starts out with a miserably failed attempt to build suspense for the ""regular"" dangers of fishing. When the storm hit, it pummels the poor fishing boat with a completely laughable attempt at building suspense and terror. The intro to Gilligan's Island was more entertaining.The only way to watch the movie without going insane, watch the trailer, ask someone who watched the movie to put the scenes from the trailer in the right order, and that's it.

Some said the altitude (above the waves) should have varied for the different rescue men jumping out. Or that only one man was injured from the jump but we aren't told why. Some said it was unlikely that only one copter would be available for a rescue. Remember the joke about the smuggler who rides his bicycle across the border and they inspect his basket and never find the contraband? In the end he confesses, ""I was smuggling bicycles!"" In this case the punch line is: there could not have been ANY helicopters! The storm would have knocked them out of the sky. Planes can't fly at all in horrible weather like that.

Once the problems started, the movie got pretty interesting. The FX were great, some of the waves were scary, but the boat miraculously survived until the very end of the movie.

Although everyone is written as lovable, no one is worthy of love or even like....Clooney and Mastrantonio come closest, but all conflict is artificial, relationships are juvenile, tears are trivial....But in the water, the action is pretty solid, when the rescue helicopter appears, we don't need any artificial characterization (""I love you, baby."") to keep us involved with the rescuers.

177,Castor-5,**** out of ****,10,30 June 2000,"The Perfect Storm just may be the only 4 star film I have seen yet this year.  It's tension builds well past that of M:I 2, and for over an hour you are kept with the storm and it's characters.  Their isn't much you can say that's wrong with this film.  This isn't a film where the characters are as complex as those in Magnolia.  I mention this only because of the past comments on this site bashing it for it's bad character development and lacking script.  If you are one of those people - pull your head out of your ass and look at the films title.As for the characters the acting is superb.  George Clooney and Mark Whalburg are together again and do an excellent job.  We really believe that they are in a storm by all the moments of hesitation, faces of fear, and the tension of their verbal fights.  Some may be surprised by the familiar faces surrounding the boat.  John C. Reily - a highly praised actor from those familiar with Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant work (myself included).  Mary Elizabeth Mastriano (?) from Robin Hood and The Abyss.  John Finchtner in another supporting role.  There is even a brief performance from Michael Ironside.  But one of the films very best performances is by Diane Lane as Bobby's wife.The special effects might be the films most talked about moments.  It spends well over an hour with the storm and it's so hard to believe that the actors are just standing behind blue screens for some of these scenes (tanks and wind blowers were also used to a large extent).  In some gripping scenes such as when Billy (George Clooney) has to snap off the anchor we wonder how in hell this was filmed with so much going on (the crew watching their captain, the captain on the crane, the anchor flying around him left to right, and of course the waves behind him while some nearly knock him off the boat).  These moments are done with skill from the ILM team, but also to the great stunt-men who nearly double the size of the cast.Warner Bros. obviously wanted this film to hit big, which it will.  But I find it rare for a film like this to be released over the 4th of July weekend.  While it's big on special effects and budget, the film is more gripping and intense for most blockbusters that are released around this time (The Patriot included).  It also has a tale of human struggle and very sad moments all around.  This may be the film to see this summer, but hopefully it will remain one of the best films of the year.",The Perfect Storm

These three meteorological phenomena at the same place and the same time create a perfect storm.  The perfect storm did occur on the Georgia Banks in 1991.  A great idea, good casting, a great screenplay, good direction, acting, editing, sound and visual effects sometimes come together and we see a perfect movie.  The perfect movie did not happen in 2000, but `The Perfect Storm' although not a perfect movie is a worthy effort.  Don't go to see good acting or hear exciting dialogue.  George Clooney is as bad as ever and the supporting cast isn't good.  The special effects are perfect!  The scenes on the sailboat, abroad the Coast Guard cutter, on the helicopter are movie equivalent of shear terror.  The scenes on the Andrea Gail (the real life swordfish boat that was lost in the perfect storm of 1991) are perfect special effects.  There is one scene where the camera pans away from the Andrea Gail as it attempts to ride over a huge breaking wave.  I'd say the scene looked `realistic' but how would I know; I've never been on a fishing boat during a hurricane.  I'll say the scene looked really convincing.

Two others hated each other for no apparent reason.The side story involving a sailboat crew was almost completely superfluous; the movie kept cutting to their story, but those characters never crossed paths with the main characters, and they barely even provided a plot point.

The second half is pure chaos and nothing else. When the storm finally starts, you can give up any hope of being able to tell what's going on.  People get thrown off the ship left and right and then get pulled back on again, but, much of the time, you can't tell just who it is that's in the water.

I was obviously expecting a philosophical drama about the eternal struggle between Man and Nature, and, knowing that the film is based on an authentic event that took place only some years ago, an extremely violent storm on the Atlantic, in which none of the crew members of a small fishing trawler survived, I really wondered how Hollywood would treat the subject. The fact that a German was elected director added another suspense-creating factor: Would there be a surprising turnaround to the habitual glorification of heroism, to the idealization of Mankind? But Wolfgang Petersen seems to be well installed in the mechanisms of Hollywood now and does not reveal much of his European origins. ""The Perfect Storm"" has the same ingredients like any of the other big disaster movies shot in the past: A bunch of outstanding men, some minor human disharmonies, which are quickly overcome in the face of death, and, above all, an overwhelming air of triumph. Yes, there is triumph, even if they all have to perish. The fishermen fight heroically, and they manage to celebrate quite a number of victories until they finally come to that ultimate wave which is just a little bit too strong for any human being to conquer. Has Nature won the battle?No, of course not. The elemental forces, the veritable villains of the movie, have only been able to inflict minor injuries to the human body. Although some tears are shed in the end, the final message is triumphantly positive: The victor is once again the American man, who will never desist from confronting and defeating Nature, whenever it seems necessary.",The Perfect Storm
184,Fredichi,Okay Sledgehammer Bombast from Peterson.,5,6 July 2000,"Perfect Storm is pretty good. Very intense but ultimately pointless.To clarify: All movies are pointless but this movie leaves you with the feeling of why did the film makers feel the need to tell you about this story. It's epic sized movie but there is no epic theme. No triumph of the will, triumph of the spirit, no against all odds and no point. So they dies at sea. Big whoop. There have been thousands and thousands of men who died at sea; on a boat; because of storms. Wow. Big deal.  What's ridiculous about this one was the fact that no one survived, so they have no idea what really happened on the boat. If you are gonna be making half the movie up. Just make the whole thing up and make one of them survive. I mean, I'm all about unhappy endings. Cause most happy endings aren't justified and just tagged on. But this one was really screaming for at least one person to survive. To make that whole journey with them and  then have them die, for what? Nothing. They didn't get the fish back and no one survived.  Not for honor. Not for proving they were better fisherman. And it wasn't like they made it out to be one of those don't mess with nature movies. The captain was supposed to be some great captain, yet he failed.So was it a simple tragedy story? Who cares. Saving Private Ryan was a tragedy; They all died for Private Ryan. Little bit of a point. Makes all the difference. I didn't sit through all that water for them all to die. Another thing that was incredibly heavy handed was that lame bit of voice over at the end by Mark Wahlberg. When he is talking to his girlfriend. And then they superimpose her over the waves. Cheeeeeeeeesey. Take a look at ""Glory"" at the very end when Mathew Broderick has to lead his men into certain death, he takes a moment to look out over the ocean. He doesn't say anything, but just the look conveys all the fear, anguish, and loneliness of what he has to do. Not some cheesey voice-over and superimposed girlfriend. Bad. Sledgehammer.

186,shamsee,Do you want your spirits lifted? Then go see this movie.,9,6 July 2000,"Never before have the Professional critics and reveiwers on IMDB who gave bad reviews, have been MORE WRONG. I am glad I read all those bad reviews, because it turned this movie into even a bigger touching, heart-warming, adrenaline pumping, heart pounding, edge of the seat, spirit lifting spectacle. The Director of 'Das Boot' doesn't let you down. How people can even use the word 'boring' to describe this movie is beyond comprehension. Those people need to get some serious help.From very beginning the movie captures the mood of tough fishing town perfectly. The fact that when boats come back, and they not only bring fish back, but also dead bodies of the crew members, lets you know what kind of tough job and tough people we are talking about here. When Wahlberg's character after spending weeks at sea, working hard and risking life, gets his cut of two thousand dollars, you can see the despair yet toughness and determination on his face. Then the director spends some time introducing the characters, showing their strengths and weaknesses, their humanity, and their sense of humor, giving them depth, so that we know they are not some comic characters, but regular folks just like us. The crew heads to sea, not only to reverse their misfortunes, but to salvage their pride, to not to come back home busted again, to face their loved ones. They have more than enough at home to make them want to come back, yet they have more than money at stake in this trip, its their pride. These two points, series of misfortunes and hurt pride are the reason, they are determined even to take on Mother Nature's most powerful creation, The Perfect Storm.One of the great scenes is when the crew has finally decided to take on the Storm, and they are standing together at the edge of the boat, waiting silently and staring at the ominous thunder and lightning and demonic dark clouds, into which they are directly headed. That is the mother of all gut check moments, and this crew had plenty of it. Up until now, the expression 'at the edge of the seat' was only an expression to me, but during this movie I realized what it meant and how it was literally true. Till the last moment, when credits start to roll, you will be in danger of falling from your seat. The glorious effects will remind you of power of nature, and hence power of something or someone, more powerful than man.The movie is all about guts and courage, and how naturally, without a moment of thought or hesitation, courage and glory come to brave men and women. This is what it must mean to inspire courage and to lift spirits.
As far as characters go, they are all very good. Wahlberg just keeps getting better and better. This man will have a stockpile of awards at his home before he is done. Mary Antonio has only two scenes, and she makes them both memorable. What an amazing actress!!! George Clooney on the other hand did a so and so job, and did not finish his homework. He and Diane Lane were either mis-cast, or not ready for their respective roles. They both got better as the movie went on, and in the end they are just as good as others, but during the beginning of the movie they feel like two fish out of water. Clooney does not appear to be a man who has lived a hard life, and who is under tremendous stress of failure. He seems a lot more educated, than he is supposed to be. He appears to be too sophisticated despite his poor shaving skills, as if he dropped out of Harvard, because he was bored with Med-school, and took up fishing as a relaxing and entertaining hobby. To all those who were complaining about the screen play, their complains are valid, but for wrong reasons. People are almost rooting for Shakespearean type theater, as if these characters who are clinging to their life by their fingernails should make deep philosophical observations about human existence. They are supposed to be blue collar fishermen for crying out loud. If any thing, they were shown to be more philosophical and sophisticated than they are supposed to be. Similarly in the case of Diane Lane's character, her mannerisms are of a Hollywood super model in the beginning, and her style of talking and walking and moving etc, all seem to be of a rich movie star, and not of a poor woman who has to stress about making two ends meet. She did not seem she had led a tough life either, and was banking her hopes on a good hardworking but poor guy. However, the best and most natural character Bugsy, provided all the laughs that were necessary.James Horner did his job. Had he done a bad job, then all those who are calling it a thrill ride, and yet dumping on him, don't realize if he had failed then it would not have been a thrill ride. The photography is just absolutely fantastic. This is a kind of movie that to truly enjoy it, you have to see it in theater. Small screen would ruin this movie. Right after seeing this movie, when me and my friend walked out, we felt so great, that had it not been late on a working day, we would have gone right back in to see it again. The most amazing thing is that it is a tragedy, yet the sheer courage of brave men and women to challenge nature itself, and to look death in the eye without fear, leaves your spirits as high as the final killer wave.Don't miss this movie, or you will regret that you payed attention to those whose idea of good screen play is long slow miserable asinine dialogues.",The Perfect Storm
187,ltj36,Lovers of the sea,10,1 October 2000,"I liked very much this movie. First, because it talks about a true story, told us without excessive emphasis, but with a sense of emotion very strong. Second, because it shows us a group of interesting characters (the fishers are not always the bravest and handsome men on the world, but normal people with problems and their women are strong characters and not only crying). Third, because this movie is an ode to the sea with the speech that George Clooney makes to Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, which is very impressive and tender. Clooney is good as the captain (half wise and half Achab) but a good work is also made by the couple Wahlberg  and Lane and two great supporters like John C. Reilly and the breakthrough Rusty Schwimmer. then we have to remember the fantastic score by James Horner, always moving and astonishing. ""The Perfect Storm"" is a very beautiful movie, which would deserve a good treatment by the Oscars, a poetic and surprising work, which I hope everyone will love.",The Perfect Storm
188,timelord-3,A fantastic summer blockbuster,9,28 June 2000,"The Perfect Storm certainly qualifies as the first real blockbuster of the season.  It easily outclasses Gone in 60 Seconds (which opens in Australia on the same day).The plot is pretty basic.  Maniacal sword fish boat captain heads back out to try and make up for some disastrous recent trips.  Pig headed captain ignores most of the dire weather reports and heads into it anyway.  Cue dramatic rescues and lots of heroic action.The last half centering around the rescue is very well done, but you would expect that from Wolfgang, who made diamonds from coal with 'Air Force One'.The action is split up into four areas, and the story wanders in and out of these events.  We have the fishing boat, we have the coast guard boat, we have the rescue helicopter, and a sailing boat that gets caught up in the fun and high seas.Now don't go and see this film if you are seasick in any way. The waves are high, and Wolfgang uses some spectacular shots to give the impression you are there, rocking on the waves with our heroes in peril.This also aint the film to see if you are in any way squeamish about the slaugtering of fish.  The film revels in the boats capturing and gutting of its catch.The Perfect Storm is a great film, promising a lot of action and certainly delivering.  George Clooney, is good, but somewhat unsympathetic as the boat captain.  Offsiders Mark Whalberg, William Fichtner, John C Reilly and John Hawkes all offer credible support as the boats crew.Go and see it on the big screen.  Give Gone in 60 Seconds a miss and see Perfect Storm *first*.9 out of 10.",The Perfect Storm
189,fofml,Great summer movie!!!,8,26 July 2000,"This is definitely a typical summer event movie, but a really good one. The movie takes enough time to introduce the characters and then the storm comes up and it's amazing what they did to create those waves. The special effects are stunning and the acting, especially by George Clooney is also very good and believable. Mr. Clooney plays a totally ordinary guy and has nothing Hollywood glamour like about the character, very well done!Overall I give it a 8/10 for it entertained me very well and the story was interesting and they actually had a script in an event movie!",The Perfect Storm
190,orourkec-292-269155,"Really good, but where is the felt dramatization?",7,28 September 2014,"I really enjoyed Perfect Storm and I thought it was a thrillingly mesmerizing and suspenseful ride from beginning to end. What I'm particularly glad about having experienced from this movie is that I was able to feel the waves, waves splashing against the boat and the rain and felt as if I was in the middle of it all. A few other great things from this movie include the fact that the acting is excellent, that the film doesn't drive away from some of the characters' personal conflicts and problems, that you could feel the American essence in this movie and that the computerized waves are visually well designed and dark and designed in such a way that you can feel as if you were close to them. One flaw however is that the movie focuses a bit too much on the action and lacks any felt dramatization during the big main middle parts of the film's viewing. That's the one crucial element that I felt the movie was badly missing, unfortunately. Nevertheless the movie's positive points that I've listed in my review manage to save the day completely for me. My rating: 7.5/10",The Perfect Storm
191,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,Perfect in its ability to build suspense,8,5 July 2000,"This movie is suspenseful like nothing I've seen in a while. The tension it creates is incredible, I mean I was on the edge of my seat watching it.Look at me, gushing over the movie I was least looking forward to this summer, who woulda thunk it? Well, when I first saw the trailer about 6 months back I thought, ""Ooo, a storm movie. Whoopee."" As it got closer to release I learned that it was based on a true story, and I also read how it turned out for the real life crew of the Andrea Gail. I thought that this might get in the way of my enjoyment of the movie, but it really doesn't (you know how a lot of historical movies will end, but that never stops you from enjoying the good ones. Was the ending to The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Ark a surprise to anyone?).Great cast of fellas everyone likes. Clooney is on a hot streak, he should be pulling in the big paychecks by now. The bar has officially been raised folks. $25 million to Gibson for The Patriot! A handful of the best and brightest are on the phone with their agents now, i'll bet. Meanwhile, Schwarzenneger, Van Damme and Stallone are getting grief from the supermarket clerk when the try to use their food stamps. Sorry guys.Clooney and Wahlberg together again, Wahlberg and Reilley together again. Who wants to bet there wasn't some serious hard drinking and skirt chasing after work on that set? I also want to mention William Fichtner, who I've been dying to see more of since his hillarious performance in Go. He definately stands out as 'Talent most deserving of wider recognition'. He's been playing bit parts for years and I hope he really gets the chance to flex his muscles sometime in a big film, but his is not a big role in The Perfect Storm. Oh well.Complaints? Sure, I have a few. Only minor stuff. I thought it ended rather abruptly. I don't know, I was expecting more. This was a little odd for a summer blockbuster. It's a true story, still fresh in the minds of some people I'm sure, and it's a special effects film. It's a tightrope that this movie walks across. It's entertainment, but it also has to be very careful in its treatment of the events leading up to and during the storm, in respect to all those involved with the rescue and those on board the Andrea Gail. I think it succeeds, and I don't believe the movie ever went for cheap thrills or was manipulative. I give her an 8/10 stars. G'night!",The Perfect Storm
192,Vassago,Yawn...,2,25 August 2000,"Oh, how - big yawn - ""exciting"" it was... Well, it's not worth saying too much. If you like a movie where special effects take over the script, directing, and any shadow of realism, and where the best actor is the sea, watch it with pleasure. Otherwise, wait until you can see it for free on TV. And even then be ready to surf the channels.",The Perfect Storm
193,McCormack7,DIANE LANE is so touching in this movie,8,25 October 2001,"Yes, the special effects are great. Yes, the film is tense and powerful. Yes, it does have GEORGE CLOONEY (Three Kings, Out Of Sight) heading an all-star cast. But what really makes this film is the sheer anguish of the loved ones left behind, portrayed brilliantly by DIANE LANE (Hardball, Judge Dredd). She is just so hauntingly effective and realistically warm and beautiful. MARKY MARK WAHLBERG (Boogie Nights, Planet Of The Apes) and JOHN C.REILLY (Hard Eight, Magnolia) also shine. And there is also KAREN ALLEN (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Starman, Scrooged) in a supporting role as one of sailboat crew. WOLFGANG PETERSEN directs with authority and assurance. It deserves to be the massive hit it was, and is a fitting and touching tribute to the real people and events.",The Perfect Storm
194,mmunies,Fun ride but with flaws,6,1 March 2001,This turned out to be a fun summer pic but it definitely wasn't extraordinary. See this movie if you love suspense and cool special effects. The story is very trite and the human interest element got on my nerves. I thought the acting overall was fine but this movie had no surprises.  We knew how it was going to end and i knew how they were building up the beginning so that we could see what was going to happen. I did not like the female characters since they seemed so one dimensional and a little absurd at times.I gave it a six - good summer fare but not much else....,The Perfect Storm
195,Atticus_1588,The Perfect Movie,8,8 February 2002,"I recently rented this movie from the video store ONLY because it was a dollar for two nights. So as you can tell I didn't expect much, but I got alot in return. I thought Petersen made this movie GREAT. I have been a fan of his since ""Outbreak"", and enjoyed his films. But what really made this movie HAD to be Clooney and Wahlberg. If they were not in the roles they portrayed it would have sucked. They mixed GREATLY together. This movie had great action sequences, great special effects, and most of all The Perfect Cast. A+ Highly recommend",The Perfect Storm
196,greenforest56,surprisingly good,8,3 August 2005,"The plot of the movie seemingly does not provide much inspiration. However, it is a well directed, written, edited and acted picture. Clooney is surprisingly believable, surprising because this is not his usual 'glamour role'. The rest of the cast all provide strong performances, even the one child. Another strength of this movie is the deft way in which the characters were developed before we get into the main plot of the drama. Since it succeeds here, we 'buy into' the characters early and become involved in their fate. A critical feature to any successful picture.It doesn't, and does, have a the usual ""Hollywood"" ending. The final words of the protagonists are 'Hollywood', but their fate is not.Special effects are good as is the score. There are no real weak points in a picture that would have been quite bad if there were.It is, altogether, a good drama. A good popcorn and date picture.",The Perfect Storm
197,jamie-81,NERVE WRACKING TENSION ON THE HIGH SEAS,10,18 July 2000,I hated to see this film end. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg give excellent performances. The special effects are outstanding.

The deep sea equivalent to Twister - only better!,The Perfect Storm
198,grendel-28,Waterworld-2...,1,7 July 2000,"OK, I did not expect the depth of Bergman's movies, or Fellini's great eye for misanscene, actually as more and more often nowdays I went to the local multiplex to be entertained, to wash off the sweat of dayly labors in the waves of a great maritime adventure... And what a wash-out did I get... EVERYTHING you heard about this flick in the negative reviews (and it's collected quite a few of those) is true, and then some. The plot is so formulaic that the characters look like the pre-production  cartoon cut-outs that never got cgi-animated. Frankly, even counting some really bad ""erotic"" flicks on the Cinemax I never saw such a generic cast of characters... Hell, they didn't even have a single bad guy in the entire movie, everybody's ""good inside"" - which the director gets out of his way to impress on the unweary within 15 seconds you first meet them. The one-liners are soo bad they would make Disney's Alladin look subtle and sophisticated. The special effects... well, if you like big waves there is about 15 minutes of footage that'll make you happy. The first half of the movie barely drags through a set of ""relationships"", that are bland, predictable, and did I say - formulaic? See, these two guys are at each other throats on the land - I wonder what happens if one of them goes overboard? Anyway, I was leaving the theater thinking :Should have fixed that ice machine ahead of time, that'll teach ya!""",The Perfect Storm
199,qrt7,"""The Perfect Pension Plan"" more like.",1,13 June 2001,"Wolfgang Petersen, who I thought an apparent genius for bringing us Das Boot, re-dons his Captain Birdseye and sets sail again.  Unfortunately Captain Petersen's vessel was holed below the waterline for this one.This is a crass, trite flick, with nothing going for it at all, an even bigger travesty is that it's grounded in fact.  I could tell this was sailing for the rocks right from the start.  The film itself is riddled with cliches and (to borrow a phrase from another reviewer) 'everything leading up to and following the storm is painfully tedious.'  Can't say that any better.The plot was poor, with little attempt to explain the characters' motivations.  Add to this the fact that these characters' are actually not that nice,...why the hell would we want to cheer them on in face of the storm and feel for the loss if we couldn't care less?  Any lingering sentimentatility is destroyed by the utter lack of realism as Clooney manages to hang on to the mast despite it falling 90 degrees with a sharp thud.  In the middle of 100mph+ winds.  Oh purrlease.And finally, to really undermine the FX, (the only thing that could have redeemed the movie) was the score.  Terribble.  The fact that there is a horrendously noisy raging storm should be enough but nooooo, we have to subjected to an overblown crappy score that is everywhere and SO DAMN LOUD, completely detracting to any reality of the storm scenes.Award of Long John Silver's deflated blow-up parrot to thee, Petersen.

201,grenmonkey,Overly dramatic but still decent,6,7 February 2010,"Although being overly dramatic, The Perfect Storm (2000) is actually a decent movie. A story about a fishing boat's crew isn't the most captivating idea but the film surprisingly manages to pull through albeit the film ends up being more about the storm than the fishing crew itself.The film is on it's best when it concentrates on the crew: lead by George Clooney, the cast on the boat does good job. The film looses it's touch when the storyline expands to cover the effects of the storm in a much broader sense and includes pointless plot lines of different sorts. These added stories all feel bland and hollow and serve no point - yes, they make the storm seem more menacing but do it very forcefully. The film would've been a lot better if it had concentrated solely on Clooney's boat and nothing else. Now it's just another traditional catastrophe movie that branches all over the place and often leaves you bored.The film looks good and the special effects still hold their ground ten years later. The film nicely builds up the momentum as the storm closes in and the performances from the cast are solid. It's far from a masterpiece and could have used another round at the cutting floor but I did enjoy most parts of it. 3/4",The Perfect Storm

Alas, it doesn't quite pull it off.  The only character I feel any real compassion for is the George Clooney character as a modern day Ahab obsessed with making the catch he needs to make his boat expedition profitable.  Even so, it is all a set up for one of the more downbeat endings ever put on the screen.The stormy special effects are the best ever portrayed for a disaster at sea movie.",The Perfect Storm

204,cathyyoung1,"Great story, terrific cast sunk by crummy screenplay",6,2 July 2000,"******SPOILERS******I had looked forward to seeing ""The Perfect Storm"" for the last couple of months.  Ever since seeing ""Boogie Nights"" on cable I've been an enthusiastic Mark Wahlberg fan.  Wahlberg and George Clooney had great rapport in ""Three Kings,"" and my expectations for TPS were raised even higher when I learned that John C. Reilly (so terrific in ""Boogie Nights"") was going to be in it as well.  It also sounded like a riveting story.Well, I am sorry to report that TPS was a major disappointment.  6 stars out of 10, tops.  Even though it breaks many of the conventions of the Hollywood blockbuster -- unglamorous characters, unhappy ending -- it ends up being just another big movie where the special effects overwhelm the human side of the story.   Not because the F/X are so good (yes, they're impressive, though the computerized water still looks a bit fake much of the time) but because the human side is so badly developed and badly written.The actors, for the most part, do the best they can with their paper-thin characters.  Clooney, I thought, was no more than OK as Captain Billy Tyne (he was much better in ""Three Kings"").  John C. Reilly, as Murph, was very affecting in the scene with his son, but then after that he had nothing to do except for that stupid feud with William Fichtner's character, Sully (which had no point except to set the stage for the cliche scene where Sully saves his life and they finally bond).  Wahlberg, as Bobby Shatford, was excellent in the early scenes with Lane and with his mother (convincing performance by Janet Wright as the mother, but Lane mostly alternates between two one-key modes: shrill and grieving).   Once on the boat, though, he and Clooney had surprisingly little chemistry.What's more, there is a major problem with the characterization of Bobby Shatford, Wahlberg's character.  In the scenes with his girlfriend Christine (Diane Lane), it's pretty clear that Bobby wants nothing more than to settle down with her and the fishing's just the best way he can make a living (the safer jobs on land don't pay as much).  In fact, he promises her that he's giving it up after this one last trip (and of course, if you didn't already know the boy wasn't coming back, that line was a dead giveaway).   Yet suddenly, once they're out to sea, it turns out that Bobby LOVES to fish -- it's not just a living, it's a passion.  So which is it?The crucial scene where the fishermen make the fatal decision to go back through the storm packs little emotional punch, because it is made too easily.  Someone (Bobby? Murph?) should have been opposed to it.  That would have set up some REAL dramatic conflict, as opposed to the contrived conflict between Muph and Sully.And the dialogue... dear Lord, the dialogue!  If I had a dime for every cheesy line in this movie it would have more than made up for the $5.50 I spent on the matinee ticket.  ""I thought the sea was your home.""  ""I think she's a helluva boat. -- With a helluva crew.  -- With a helluva skippuh."" ""He's my precious boy and you're the woman for him.""  Not to mention gems like ""This is the moment of truth.... this is what separates the men from the boys,"" or Clooney's pretentious ode to the glories of being a swordboat captain.I can't even say that the movie delivers on the promise of white-knuckle thrills. The Coast Guard rescue scenes were good but too long.  As for the action on the Andrea Gail, much of it was repetitive (Clooney and Wahlberg getting pelted with water).  Frankly, too, this is where knowing that they all die undercuts the suspense.Yes, there were some very good scenes.  The scene between Wahlberg and Lane where they wake up in the morning.  The humorous but moving little story line between Bugsy (John Hawkes) and Irene (Rusty Schwimmer), the woman he tries to pick up at the bar.  Later on, one scene that was very powerful, both visually and emotionally, was when the sun suddenly comes out and the guys think that the storm is over and they've made it -- only to realize, seconds later, that it's NOT over.  That was a lump-in-the-throat kind of moment.Finally, great scene of the Andrea Gail's demise: Wahlberg swims out of the capsized boat while Clooney stays behind and we see his figure being swallowed by pitch-black darkness; then the boat seems to right itself, only to sink instantly; and there is Wahlberg, a lone speck of humanity in a vast raging sea, amidst hurricane-force winds, torrential rains, giants waves. What a terrifying and poignant image; what a powerful expression of the tragedy of man crushed by nature's wrath.  And then the filmmakers had to go and ruin it all with Bobby's maudlin psychically telegraphed speech to his girlfriend -- ""Can you hear me, Christine?  I love you... there's no goodbyes, only love"" -- and the ghostly apparition of Lane in the left corner of the screen.  I am not a cynic but there's a big difference between true feeling and mawkish sentimentality.  I thought the scene of Kate and Leo's final farewell in ""Titanic"" was corny beyond belief, but this takes the cake.And just when you thought it couldn't get any hokier, the movie ends with a replay of Clooney's ""isn't it great to be a swordboat captain"" speech... it's bad enough that we had to hear it the first time around! I half-expected to see a ghostly apparition of Clooney smiling beatifically at Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio from fisherman heaven.Bill Witliff, the screenwriter, should henceforth be known as Bill Witless.Wahlberg deserves a better screenplay.  Come to think of it, so does just about everyone else in this movie.",The Perfect Storm

The historical end is as known as it was in Titanic and Gallipoli: a so-called perfect storm occurs off of the Maine-NovaScotian coast claiming the lives of the crew of a lone fishing boat.

I don't know why I took so long watching it, but I'm glad I finally did. The interesting thing about The Perfect Storm is that it's shock-full of special effects, but it isn't an action movie, a fantasy movie, or a sci-fi movie. It's mainly a drama, with elements of suspense. Thus the special effects take a secondary place, even though they're everywhere. Also very interesting is the aforementioned suspense. I already knew what the outcome of the movie was going to be, but somehow director Wolgang Petersen manages to create dramatic tension and keeps you wondering (once again despite you already knowing the end). This makes it similar to Paul Greengrass' United 93, the best movie of 2006 in my opinion. While The Perfect Storm doesn't reach the levels of excellence of United 93, it remains a very good film, a character-driven blockbuster. The cast is very good and Petersen is often very underrated as a director. This is a movie I'd very strongly recommend.",The Perfect Storm

I can't believe that someone is going to weld on an antenna tower in the middle of a perfect hurricane. It would be like changing your wiper blades in the middle of a tornado. I also found the event where a shark hitches a ride like a San-Fran troly a hard bait to swallow. I could not find a reason the family, who were rescued, was in the movie. I kept waiting for the paths of them and the sword fisherman to cross.A good movie absorbs me and makes the unbelievable, improbable, impossible very real and I am right in it. This movie did entertain me but several times I thought ""yeah right"". It just reminded me of the old war movies when men were men. All they needed was some tobacco spittin, barb-wire chewin and a few grenades to fall on and enemy that was not a bunch of swirling pressure systems.It was very exciting and entertaining but, overall, not something to mount on your wall.

209,bonsai-superstar,The Perfect Snore,4,1 May 2009,"Acting: from the opening ""nightmare"" scene, I laughed out loud: the acting is literally laughably bad. Clooney and Wahlberg are almost okay, but the rest...it's embarrassing. The random attempts at the local accents...it seems like they just gave up.Score: again, from the very beginning, the score is overwhelmingly loud and doesn't match whats being portrayed on screen. Majestic music for a fish-weighing scene? Check. Who could have written such pompous stuff? Why, it's our old friend James Horner, infamous for re-using his (and others) material. Further, the effects are unbearably loud to the extent that I was forced to fast-forward through the majority of the action scenes (most of which are simply CGI waves anyway).Setting: set in the early 90's, this thing has more of a cheesy 80's vibe to it. At least, quality-wise.Many here are concerned with whether the story is true to life / the novel or not. I don't care: I just want a good story and, like most, am willing to forgive plot holes, embellishments, exaggerations, etc. However, I have to wonder why this story was even told. To be frank, it seems to simply be an excuse to use the latest CGI technology to show extreme weather. The characters and story were virtually non-existent.

214,vivesi-1,A Bad Adaptation?,4,27 March 2003,"I have never read the book from which this film was made but I can say that the only thought the movie inspired in me was: Why would anyone, given the information the fishermen had, try to make it through that storm? The movie portrayed the fishermen as morons for trying (what's a fate worse than a terrifying death--certainly not being short on rent one month?) And then there is a tacked on appeal to treat them as heroes? Who did they save? What great thing did they accomplish? Again, maybe this was a poor adaptation.
The lack of plot, character depth, etc., of course is no issue because this movie is all about just one scene, the big wave. To make us slog through an hour of drivel just to get to a couple of neat shots is unforgivable. I saw this for free and I still feel cheated.",The Perfect Storm
215,theguy,Meh,3,19 June 2021,"The movie is written well, and the actors and acting is great - but the story is difficult to embrace when it's just someone's ""best guess"" of what happened.I was in DC during ""the storm of the century"", and the storm itself was blown incredibly out of proportion.With so many other stories of tragedy at sea, why this one? Why this crew?And perhaps the largest problem at all - why not show actual photos of the actual crew at the end?Are we to be awed by the special effects alone? It is a shame we were not given the necessary facts to bond with the actual crew.",The Perfect Storm
216,Sardony,Cliche upon cliche.,2,29 July 2000,"The Perfect Storm is a cliche-fest.  Familiar archetype characters speaking ridiculous dialogue of the melodramatic Soap Opera kind brought embarassingly to life through overwrought performances. 
There's nothing subtle about THE PERFECT STORM.  Characters and their relationships are about as subtle as a brick to the head:  The gotta-win ship's captain; his condescending boss; the blue-collar couple struggling to make it (She: ""I'm really gonna' give it a go this time!""); the hardy, salty & wise middle-aged female bar-owner [counterpart to TWISTER's old Aunt]; the fat chick familiarly defensive about her weight; the heartwarming sap of the non-custodial parent and his son; there's even a grizzled old fisherman barfly (""I remember when..."" ).  One wonders if director Wolfgang Peterson's understanding of english is so weak that he needed these characterization and dialogue overstatements to have felt that their message was getting across sufficiently.  Clooney and Wahlberg give decent performances, but only because they don't ""try"" to act as much as the others.  Actually, as the ""fat chick"" (Irene), Rusty Schwimmer is pretty good even though she's got stupid dialogue to trod through; in the end, she's the only one I cared anything about.  But absolutely the WORST performance (and one of the most embarassing I've seen in recent years) is from Diane Lane as Wahlberg's girlfriend.  For starters, she can't manage the accent (Wahlberg, from near Boston, gets sort of close but lacks the northern Massachusetts twang).  And Lane gives it her ""TV-acting"" all: yelling her emotions to prove how strongly she feels, TRYING to convey a tough-gal swagger while drinking in the local bar. Embarassing.  What's happened to acting in recent years?  It seems someone is teaching ""actors"" (of the TV kind, mostly), to ""demonstrate"" every emotion and motivation visibly.  I can hear the acting coach now: ""Exaggerate the mime of your emotion, honey!  Don't let anyone doubt what you're feeling.  CONVEY!""This was one of the few movies that while watching it I actually put my hand to my cheek and shook my head in disbelief (at how stupid it all was).  And I swear I nearly laughed out loud during the sequence out in the storm when Clooney climbs out onto a boom of his ship to cut loose an anchor that's whipping around on it's chain and breaking things:  Clooney clinging desperately to that boom in those churning waves reminded me of that old slapstick visual gag of some guy on the ladder of a firetruck as it races through a city, the swinging-to-and-fro ladder narrowly missing bridges and sides of buildings.  At least the effects looked pretty good, though they did have that ""computer"" look to them.",The Perfect Storm
217,Budd-5,A true story? Yeah right.,6,10 August 2000,"******SPOILERS********Okay there was a storm; a pretty major storm in 1991 and 6 fishermen died out there. That part of the movie was true but the most intense and best parts of the movie are complete fiction. What happened to the fishermen? Nobody knows this. Petersen and his writer come up with an action adventure flick that works. The action is exciting. We care enough about the characters to make it interesting. The special effects are amazing. Wow! Can you imagine being out at sea in a storm like that? I wouldn't need to drown, I would have a heart attack.However there are problems. The dialogue is rubbish and the director fails to make any of the relationship's any bit touching. Mark Wahlberg (impressive) and Diane Lane's (not so impressive) relationship gets the most screen time but she is a thinly drawn character that we don't care for. George Clooney gives a fine performance as he underplays the role of the Skipper beautifully but his so-called relationship with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is much like their sea adventure; a disaster. Were they lovers? Were they friends? Her tears at the end suggests the former. Also Bugsy's relationship is laughable. He meets a woman the night before he leaves and we are expected to believe that because they barely spoke one night that she is in love with him and she is going to miss him for eternity. PLEASE!This film is based on a true story. We are told this at the beginning and though the word ""based"" must be taken into consideration, I was disappointed that nobody survived because 75% of the movie takes place out on that boat and there is no chance in hell that we know what honestly happened out there.** (out of four)",The Perfect Storm

219,amatrimonials,Entertaining enough,7,7 January 2014,"As movies these days tend to go, this was not half-bad.Let me say right off the bat that I don't like George Clooney too much. Many of his pictures tend to be about him rather than the plot. Or better put, he more or less IS the plot. He usually heroically, against all possible and impossible odds, saves the day, which is I find supremely irritating. Indeed, that is the pattern often followed by Hollywood when there's a big-shot ""celebrity"" starring.So to hear Georgie intone in his deadpan trademark too-sexy-for-this-flick voice ""I wanna fish; it's what I do"" was beyond hysterical!Anyway, I was not familiar with the background story, and thought right through the end that they were going to make it, for obvious reasons (the superhuman skipper in charge of the fishing vessel, of course!). I am deeply sorry about the fishermen who died that day, and even more so their families, but for the purposes of this picture, I have to confess to being glad about the corollary. I'm saturated to the brim with the schmaltzy, hyper-unrealistic happy-ending movies.",The Perfect Storm

Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was really good. Anyway, it was a good movie and kind of original. 8/10",The Perfect Storm

I was wary of this one from the minute I read the book.  When I heard Peterson was helming it, my fears abated a tad.  Maybe, just maybe, the director of Das Boot and In the Line of Fire could pull it off.  Unfortunately it was the director of Air Force One that showed up.  Stinky, man, stinky.  Stunningly cliched dialogue and characterizations, fictional and totally unnecessary additions to the real story (which was more compelling than what was presented), and confused stories.  If you read the book, you know about the tanker and the sailboat; in the movie they're mere distractions with no reason for being there.Once again Hollywood grabs and guts a damn good true story.",The Perfect Storm

George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Diane Lane, William Fichtner, John C.

223,jennifer-99,"Big budget effects, low budget drama.",6,24 November 2000,"It's not that this was a bad movie...it wasn't.  I just expected a lot more than 6 wet guys getting thrown around on a boat for 2 hours while uttering some cliche, poorly written dialogue.  To be perfectly honest, I have not read the book, nor had I heard any of the story behind the movie beforehand, so I had no pre-conceived notions before sitting down to watch.  However, seeing the finished product, I don't think that this movie could have possibly done justice to these fisherman and the story of their tragic journey.  I enjoy mindless special effects and action just as much as the next guy, but this movie, being loosely based on a true story, should have been driven more by characters, plot and drama and less by special effects.  The visuals should have just been an added bonus to a rich story and believable characters.  The producers/directors/writers put so much money and energy into the storm itself and forgot to develop the characters into anything more than cardboard, emotionless cutouts.  By the time we got to the climax of the movie, I found myself not caring what the outcome was nor wanting to shed a single tear for their plight.  In general, the movie was watchable, but not the emotional, gripping drama that the studio planned for it to be.  Not a bad rental, but I would have hated to blow the $12 to see it on the big screen.",The Perfect Storm
224,barbb1953,"A perfect film, but you may only want to see it once.",10,11 November 2010,"Sometimes a movie can be too good.This movie is a real slice of life, and considering its subject, that's challenging to deal with. One of the other commenters said not to watch this for entertainment or if you can't take a lot of stress; it is also a fun movie, but overall they were right.Everything was put into making this as real as it possibly could be, and considering that it's hard even for meteorologists to believe that the Hallowe'en Noreaster had 100-foot waves out there in the vicinity of the ""Andrea Gail"" (it more than likely did, based on interpretation of measurements taken by a buoy not too far from the spot where she went down), it is absolutely mind-boggling that the film makers re-created this so well.I have read written accounts of big boats ""surfing"" down huge waves, and of attempted sea rescues that are difficult because the sea is so rough that sometimes the person in trouble is high up above the rescue ship and and, the next second, is far, far below it (note the difference in usage between ""boat"" and ""ship"" there, referring to sizes respectively, of the ""Andrea Gail"" and the Coast Guard vessel). The X, Y, and Z axes are just going all over the place out there when the sea gets really bad.You will see all that and more in ""The Perfect Storm,"" just as it must happened in real life. One can't say that too often about movies. There are just no words to describe the experience. It is exhilarating and draining at the same time. It helps that the director has built in some quiet moments (where it definitely wouldn't have been too quiet in real life) to give the audience a break, but generally you get as hyped up at the edge of your seat as Clooney and Marky Mark are in the bridge of the ""Andrea Gail"" or as the Coast Guard would-be rescuers are, first in the aircraft and then at their ship's rail, as that whole thing plays out for them.It's fun, but not in the way that an amusement park ride is. Once it's over and the adrenaline drains away, a bit of an aversion/reaction to the intensity of it all sets in. But that's later on, after the movie is over. While you're still in the movie, you have to watch all these people you have been introduced to and grown to care about in the ultimate moments leading up to their deaths, right at the point where they realize they are going to die.That's hard, but we are also given the chance to see what a real captain does in a situation like that, and the last moments of Marky Mark/Bobby are so scary and yet fine. There is still hope...no, not really, but there is still love. That's confirmed at the very end of the film story, and it's a good way to close. The last part of the film is a silent tribute to the **ten thousand** Gloucestermen who have been lost to the sea since the 1600s.A favorite scene: The whole Michael/Irene subplot. Surprising, and beautiful, and believable human transformations in that.Favorite quote (from memory): ""We're back in the 19th century now!""A complaint (really the only one): There's a shot of Hurricane Hunters flying into a Category 5 storm somewhere: it couldn't be in this storm, though, because the hurricane contributing to its formation never got above a Category 2.Nice little detail: The ""you are floating above the Earth looking down"" shots of the hurricane are ""live"": they show the clouds rotating around the eye (this had to be special effects, not archival film). Most movie makers just slap a satellite image in there for everything, but in ""The Perfect Storm"" they only do this where it would have been real: when the meteorologist has pulled up the latest satellite images on his computer.This is a good example of the attention to detail they took to make this ""real."" It was a success financially and it won some awards, though I'm surprised it didn't win more. The BAFTA's got it right with the special effects, and after you've watched the movie, check out the names of all the people who got a big award for their ""water work.""

225,microbonnie,probably better read the book first...,4,29 July 2000,"or at least that's what I hear from someone who, upon hearing my disgusted impression of this movie, said that he liked it much more after reading the novel (which he said was excellent).  And I can see that.  Maybe the characters were better developed in the novel, but in the movie alone they came across as cheesy and two dimensional.  The story, which was ""based on a book"" which was ""based on a true story,"" was flat in some parts and overplayed in others.  The effects, of course, were great--some of those waves were straight from my childhood nightmares.  But the subplot with the seemingly random people out on a private boat was just, well, random.  The one good line in the whole movie was ""I always find the -----ng fish!"" by hardcore king, George Clooney.",The Perfect Storm
226,MrBook,I felt cheated,7,16 February 2001,"This wasn't a bad movie, but I usually expect more from Wolfgang Peterson. The acting was good (with the exception of Diane Lane trying to hard), and the special FX were decent, but other then that I don't see what all the praise is about. I was expecting a sad tear-jerker, and instead got a ho-hum action movie. People mention how ""exciting"" the movie is, but the last third consists of waves going up and down, with the occasional ship or person in the water that needs to be rescued. I'll tell you why I felt cheated, but it involves a spoiler:****SPOILER WARNING******
When it's revealed at the end that everyone on the ship died, I felt totally cheated. This pretty much says that any dialogue shown on the ship didn't really happen, and they added it in there just to make a movie. If I was the family of George Clooney's character, I would be mad for seeing him be protrayed as a pig-headed captain who was the reason the whole crew died. The final scene with Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney was just way to sappy. If your going to make a movie based on a true story, don't make it out more than what it really was. This is just an example of Hollywood making a true story into Hollywood.",The Perfect Storm

228,Jeremy-124,Mostly perfect,8,2 July 2000,"""The Perfect Storm"" may not be quite perfect, but most of it is brilliant, rousing filmmaking.  And all involved deserve great credit for making every effort to be respectful of the people portrayed in the story, and of the fishing industry itself.The storm scenes are absolutely phenomenally real.  You feel drawn into the action, and even though the outcome is never in doubt, there is strong suspense in many scenes.  You care about the guys on the boat, and you want the inevitable to be delayed for as long as possible.The performances are excellent.  George Clooney is a believeable, slightly obsessed captain.  Mark Wahlberg continues to impress as an actor, and John C. Reilly is the perfect likeable working guy.  William Fichtner is good too, but his Gloucester accent is a bit in and out.  The same is true for Diane Lane, who I like as an actor, but her accent is much broader in some scenes than others.The opening and closing scenes are a bit overly schmaltzy, but there's enough genuine feeling to make it work.  The only other problem I have is with a couple of anachronisms in the script.  Clooney makes a speech about why he loves being a sword boat captain, and he describes the areas the boat passes when leaving Gloucester Harbor.  One thing he mentions is ""waving to the lighthouse keeper's son on Thacher Island.""  There have been no lighthouse keepers on Thacher Island in 20 years, and no families there since long before that.  And as the words are heard in the movie you see Eastern Point Lighthouse, not Thacher Island. Sorry, I can't help it -- I research and write about lighthouses for a living.  Another anachronism -- Clooney says something to the crew about looking like they were ""in a brawl in Scollay Square.""  The Scollay Square section of Boston hasn't existed in about 40 years; it seems unlikely that a Gloucester fisherman would make a remark like this.  I know I'm being picky, but for the most part the movie pays such close attention to detail that these things stand out for me.All in all this is a satisfying film and a worthy tribute to the generations of people who have worked and sacrificed in the fishing industry.",The Perfect Storm
229,FilmLover-4,"Good movie, over-rated special effects",8,23 July 2000,"I'm sure there will be plenty written on this movie, so I'll call into question one apparent given - the special effects (the rogue waves) were not that convincing.

Character development wasn't too bad, either and some genuine moments of tension are created as several crew members lives are threatened and as the storm closes in.

(The term ""Perfect Storm"" is based upon the novel...meteorologists officially called it the ""Holloween Storm"" as it occurred on Oct. 31).Although a highly speculative and fictionalized account of the actual events, The Perfect Storm does contain some fact-based elements regarding the storm itself as well other rescues the US Coast Guard was involved in during the storm which battered the Eastern seaboard.George Clooney and Mark Whalburg give great performances (actually I thought this to be George Clooney's best performance to date), and the story depicts the ""love-hate"" relationship commercial fishermen face fairly accurately.The SFX are great, although at times quite exaggerated, and give the viewer an idea of what it would be like to be on a small ocean-going vessel during rough weather.Overall a very good film and excellent on a big screen TV with the surround-sound on full blast.",The Perfect Storm

How should I know? What do I look like -- some kind of meteorologist? Well, one meteorologist working at a TV station in Boston says that if it happens, it's going to be ..... ""The Perfect Storm.""Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are rival -- friendly rival -- sword-boat captains out of Gloucester, Mass. They even wear ""rival"" baseball caps -- she wears a CAT hat (Caterpillar) while he wears a John Deere. But secretly inside, you strongly suspect they've both got a ""thing"" for each other. Linda has been on a hot streak lately when it comes to bringing in the swordfish. Billy, on the other hand, has been ice-cold -- as in, few fish on ice. So much so, in fact, that he decides on a quick two-day turnaround and back out to sea for another shot at the big payday. It is while he and his crew are out to sea on the quick turnaround trip that this so-called ""storm of the century"" comes a-brewin'. And that means Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with B and that stands for Boat -- the Andrea Gail -- which Billy skippers.
""The Perfect Storm,"" as I understand it, is a true story that took place in October 1991. Why does everything happen in October? The ""storm of the century."" Halloween. Columbus discovers the New World. The Gunfight at the OK Corral. Oh. That's only four things. Maybe October isn't so bad after all. Unless ..... you're a crewman on the Andrea Gail ..... or on the chopper come to rescue them.Before writing this review, I read a limited number (about 20) of the IMDb User Comments on this movie (there may be over 600 by now). To my astonishment, most of the User Comments on this movie are quite negative. Some were extremely negative. Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the movie 2½ stars, which I think is just about right-on. Unlike the title of the movie, the movie itself is not perfect. The movie's main attraction, of course, is its scenes of storm-tossed seas and the effect of same upon those caught thereon. Even I have to admit that watching people getting tossed into the drink and countless shots of the Andrea Gail getting battered and bashed got to be a bit much after awhile. Still, director Wolfgang Petersen gets kudoes for the realism he brought to the many scenes of stormy seas.But most Users/Complainers cite lack of character development as perhaps the movie's biggest failing. Frankly, I don't get it. If you want to say BAD character development, that might be one thing. But LACK of character development?! I don't think so. This movie has PLENTY of character development of the movie's main characters, especially for this kind of movie, when almost everything and everyone take a back seat to the special effects. Do you know what I think? Methinks the MALE Users who are throwing brickbats at this movie are simply green-eyed of the two stars, George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, both of whom are VERY popular with the women of America.If one can put out of one's mind that this is a true story and what that implies, ""The Perfect Storm"" is a reasonably entertaining way to pass a couple of hours. And if you don't know the ending in advance -- and I didn't -- that makes for an even more compelling reason to watch it.

It purports to be based on a true story (SPOILERS COMING) but as all the people in the boat died all those sequences must be pure conjecture.It starts off in typical disaster movement style, gradually introducing the characters, but there is really little time or opportunity to empathise with any individuals.Its quite engrossing at the start, but then you realise that the characterizations are pretty wooden. The storm sequences are of course very dramatic but after a while its one long yawn. (MORE SPOILERS) Once the helicopter comes down, it becomes extremely tedious, with wave after wave hitting the boat, lots of shouting of 'watch out' or 'do something'.It certainly makes you aware of the nightmare of a being a fisherman, particularly in this area where so many have died over the years.The whole experience reminded me of watching a moderate TV movie on a sunday afternoon half asleep. This is surely the destiny for this film.I should imagine that the book is much more interesting.",The Perfect Storm
234,Sabriane,Visual wonder with a hollow centre,5,5 July 2000,"For starters, the crew of 'Andrea Gail' doesn't even hit the sea for at least forty minutes from the start of the movie. These forty minutes mean to generate our sympathy and liking for the characters and make us emotionally invested in their fates, yet to me it felt more like fourty minutes of boring and bad melodrama. Now, I consider myself a total sap; I weep uncontrollably each time I watch Titanic, City of Angels and dozens of other Hollywood weepies. I'm not one of those people who roll their eyes every time a movie tries to tug at the heartstrings and scream 'cheesy melodrama!' every time there's a slightest showing of emotion in a Hollywood movie. But even I found myself by turns giggling and cringing at the awful, awful melodrama (as opposed to GOOD melodrama), accompanied by the intrusive score which reminded you exactly what you're supposed to feel at this or that moment. I nearly laughed out loud when George Clooney gave his ridiculous 'Oh how do I love thee, sea' speech. I wasn't a particularly big fan of George Clooney before, and now that I've seen him in 'The Perfect Storm' I'm definitely starting to feel that he's better off back on the small screen. He just doesn't seem to have the kind of silver screen presence and charisma that marks a true star like, say, Mel Gibson, and found it hard to believe that his character was the kind of a leader that the other men would follow. I was far more impressed with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and her strong and no-nonsense character; unfortunately she is virtually ignored for the rest of the movie.
So, with no characters I could admire or sympathise with on 'Andrea Gail', I was far more enthralled with the parallel story of the Coast guard team and their courageous attempts to save the passengers of the little sailboat that too got trapped in the storm. Now, these were the men whose actions I could admire, in fact I believe that I would have enjoyed the movie more if only they were made the central characters instead of a bunch of people whose greed precedes their common sense. I mean no disrespect to the actual people who lost their lives in the storm, but that's exactly how this film paints them: as the reckless fishermen whose choice to risk their lives for the sake of $250,000 worth of fish was motivated purely by money, nothing else. While their choice was justifiable, it just didn't make for a satisfying movie experience.On the plus side, I must congratulate the team responsible for the effects. During the whole run of the film, it never occured to me to think, wow, I'm watching cool CGI waves. The sea looks and feels absolutely real, and gives you a true sense of Mother Nature gone berserk. There was also an amazing aerial shot, initially placed over the two storms and a hurricane, which then dived below through the swirling clouds to show us the black raging waves lashing back and forth on the ocean level. That shot sent shivers down my spine, truly powerful stuff.Unfortunately, the initial impact of the furious sea didn't last for more than half an hour, with me getting used to the sight of crashing waves and the whole affair starting to feel fairly monotonous. Add to that zero emotional engagement, and what you have for the last twenty minutes is tiredness and boredom, somewhat livened up by the big money shot of a huge wave we all saw in the trailer. In the whole, a 5 star experience.",The Perfect Storm
235,spottedreptile,Not a good tribute to a very real tragedy,6,4 July 2000,"We are reminded at the very beginning of this film that it is based on a true story - a very real human drama. What a pity the film seems to forget this and the people who died and those who still live to mourn their loved ones, and plunge into an orgy of special effects and woefully thin characterisations which only serve to undermine the drama of what went on in 1991 off the Grand Banks.The vfx are great - the cgi waves are dammed realistic and the sense of the menacing, tossing storm front is utterly compelling. For me this was by far the best part of the film.The rest was forgettable. The characters were poorly introduced and spent far too long in the bar trying to set themselves and their relationships up before going off to make their big kill and bring home the bacon.  It sounded phoney and made me wish they'd just go to sea and get on with it. And when they did I felt actually quite disgusted with them - greedy, selfish and stupid. I can't believe the real fishermen acted with such poor judgment. I was on the side of the swordfish for most of the fishing trip, poor things.The dialogue was lame and the entire screenplay felt padded and contrived. The conflicts between the fishermen seemed as though the writers realized they didn't have enough of a story and had to invent some more.And don't these guys ever wear lifejackets? Their seamanship seemed unprofessional at best - how many times do people need to get washed overboard before they realize they ought to be wearing some sort of life preservation?I felt for the poor guys who had to rescue these people. They were the real heroes as far as I was concerned.This is where I felt the film fell down the most - it lacked any real human heart and soul. I should have cared that real people lost their lives and others mourned for them. But somehow this message got lost in the (numerous) waves which swamped the boats and eventually swamped the film. The ending was syrupy - as if the director was apologizing for what happened and had to make the audience feel better.This should have been filmable. I've watched plenty of real-life films where it has been pulled off with style.

238,jacob.rosen,Spectacularly God-awful,2,11 December 2000,"If should come as no surprise that after the ridiculously cheesy ""Air Force One"" hack director Wolfgang Petersen should provide a follow-up just as spectacularly god-awful. Here he attempts to provide the same awe for something omnipotent (nature) as he did in the last film (the Presidency of the United States) but all he's able to provide is gross sentimentality amidst uneven special effects. Ostensibly the true story of a doomed commercial swordfishing expedition, Bill Wittliff's astonishingly corny screenplay seeks to provide fictionalized moral uplift while delivering the assumed dramatic goods. Because the inherent tragedy by itself probably wouldn't sit well with today's audience, Wittliff counterpoints the main drama with two other tales of survival designed to mollify and appease but there's so little character development that it comes off confusing and uninvolving. There's a lot made of the grand lure of the sea by the New Englanders who love and depend on it but the main characters themselves are driven purely by motives of profit and competition, something Wittliff never bothers to explore. The acting, led by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane, has no presence whatsoever. The score by James Horner is terrible, serving as a unrelenting, overbearing supplement to the action. Petersen has fallen a long way since ""In The Line Of Fire""; at least there John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood offset his jingoism.",The Perfect Storm
239,Squirrel-5,Not quite accurate but good effects,7,1 July 2000,"This film although emotional, is quite possibly not accurate.Any events depicted after the last radio contact with the Andrea Gail is pure speculation. It has good acting and excellent special effects. It is based on a true story(obviously) about 3 different storms (the remnants of Hurricane Gail) and 2 fronts which collided to produce a MAJOR storm that hit New England in late October 1991",The Perfect Storm
240,Gordon-38,"Absorbing and entertaining, but flawed",7,2 July 2000,"""The Perfect Storm"" is quite certainly a picture that drew me in, kept me interested and frequently caused me to hold my breath or grab the armrest on my chair.  It's visually stunning - whatever special effects they use to create extreme weather have improved even in the few years since ""Twister.""George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are both excellent actors and turn in fine performances here.  The rest of the cast isn't really given much to do - they sit and look anxious and scream or cry or both occasionally, but not much beyond that.The film's biggest flaw is important but not fatal.  The very chaos of a hurricane that has been so effectively recreated here has a tendency to make the action hard to follow at times, especially during the sequences involving the Coast Guard helicopter and its crew.  There's no real way to tell these characters apart, and that makes it somewhat difficult to develop much interest in what happens to them.  Furthermore, the Coast Guard sequences mostly just serve to intrude upon the story and characters we really care about, the Andrea Gale and her crew.It's too bad, because the stuff aboard the swordboat is pretty good.  On the whole, a strong but not outstanding film.",The Perfect Storm
241,thundrmi,Perfectly AWFUL,2,23 June 2000,"(Preface: I had the opportunity to view this film at a promotional ""sneak preview"" hosted by Warner Brothers one week before the 6/30 opening. Luckily, I did not have to pay to see it.)Everyone in Perfect Storm is miserable.  The fishermen, their women, the townsfolk, the Coast Guard, the AUDIENCE.The film begins with the return of the rugged-looking but angst-ridden crews of two fishing boats to a small (Hollywood-envisioned) New England port. One crew, led by a haggard looking female captain (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,) was successful; the other, led by a brooding and ill-kempt Captain Billy(George Clooney) failed to catch a good haul and is in deep trouble (but not as much as the script!).Soon, we meet members of the fishing crew. Their personal issues.  What they've given up for their love of the sea. Their long-suffering women-folk. We are confronted with overly dramatic monologues on the nobility of seafaring. Over-the-top dialogue is turned a notch-up by overer-the-top acting.Everyone looks terribly grungy.  Apparently the Gillette reinforcement ship was sunk in an earlier storm, as scraggly beards are donned by everyone in town and on either boat  (except the lady captain who simply wears no make up).As Clooney's boat departs for its next ""catch fish or be damned"" mission, the townsfolk give an oddly heroic, teary sendoff.  It's as if eveyone knows what's going to happen in the film as well as in the audience.   Which begs the question..so WHY GO, Dummies?It worsens.  The weather, and the plot.  Contrived hassles between crewmates.  Hokey ""Jaws-like"" shipboard (yes-shipboard!) shark attacks... faulty radio equipment and missed warning calls.   Ignored radar images of the approaching storm.The film smells worse than the fish spoiling in the hold of the leaky vessel.  Too late for an S O S.    Let it sink!",The Perfect Storm
242,psycholemming,Can we say characterization?,1,10 July 2000,"I went to this movie believing I would really enjoy it, having heard it described as a disaster movie with heart.  Sure, it was a disaster movie--the storm practically made me seasick--but it had no heart.  The only characters given the slightest hint of development were Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane's, and even then only in passing.  Was I supposed to care about them?  I think I would have felt more had I read the headline ""Fishermen Die at Sea"" in the newspaper.  This movie could have sailed beautifully, especially with fine actors like George Clooney and Diane Lane (both of whom have proved their acting prowess in other pictures), but instead it sank like a stone.",The Perfect Storm
243,humpback,not perfect enough...,7,21 July 2000,"Saw the movie last night, after having had great expectations about it for weeks. With Wolfgang Petersen directing, a humongous 120 million dollar budget, a well stuffed quiver of stars - how could it possibly miss ?It did, though not by much.... While the plot is simple (not in itself a fault ) and everybody knows the eventual outcome, the film still manages to get off the ground and take the audience along well enough. Both the introduction of the crew, their background and motivations, as well as the pressures of home, job and aspirations are done smoothly, expertly and not overly tearful. Kudos to Mr. Petersen for that !When the 'Andrea Gail' finally leaves the harbour for her fateful voyage, one -does- understand why the fishermen sail forth for 'one final haul' - and one knows for certain that they understand the dangers involved, and go nevertheless. Overall, the film never fails on this count, neither does it on athmosphere or depicting the gritty, all-male, environment of the swordboat. The build up of tension which follows is expertly done until the sinking, although the yachting trip (which is a secondary subplot) is quite clichee and stereotypical - but prepares the far more interesting story of the rescue helicopter' struggle and plight. So far so good.The big letdowns are the storm itself - despite million of dollars in CGIs and  superior sound hardware in the cinema, it never feels real, present or solid. Having sailed in some pretty rough weather myself might have contributed, but overall the atlantic storm, waves and spray in Petersen's own 'Das Boot' of 1980(!) are far more intense, real and convincing then the'Perfect Storm' of 2000. Especially during the daylight scenes one just felt that this wasn't 'real', but just some fancy, expensive animation. There never - except for those scenes actually shot on the shore in Maine - is any perceptible presence of the wind, its sheer orcanic force and gusts or the might and dread of an onrushing wave. Petersen seems to have realized this shortcoming - there are a vast number of close-up shots of Clooney and Wahlberg to compensate for it, and the actors labour to convey the tension, respect and later, dread they feel, but there are only a few shots of the tossing sea around the 'Andrea Gail' in all its supposedly terrible fury. So the audience gets the strange impression, that while the  Coast Guard ship and the rescue helicopter seem to be in dire straits, the 'Andrea Gail' seems to encounter only minor 'difficulty' in weathering the storm - besides some inevitable action-themed complications.I personally have never in my entire life seen (or thought possible) as many men swept overboard a steaming, pitching, rocking boat by waves/whatever, without lifevests, dry suits or other equipment, in full encumbering gear, boots and sweaters and still be rescued, especially smack in the middle of 'the storm of the century'!As for that final monstrous, ship devouring wave - well, who is to judge upon its appearance ? Nevertheless, to me, it looked like it sneaked out of 'Deep Impact' for a quick cameo appearance..... As for critics claiming they got 'seasick' watching its 'realism', I guess it must have been the Nachos with that double side-order of cheese!Still, overall its a pretty wild ride, and solid entertainment is delivered. What really ruins part of the 'Storm' for me are the two 'Titanic'scripted scenes with Mr. Wahlberg, which I couldn't care less for, and the overly tearful, sentimentalist  and weepy epilogue, which is truly nerve-grating.At least half the audience (and not only the male part, mind you) started to groan in agony when one lengthy eulogy for the crew after another got delivered - not to slighten Mrs. Mastrantonio's talent, but it gets sadly wasted this way.On a general note, the soundtrack does get slightly monotonous after a while, while the cast performs uniformly well. What faults there are with the movie aren't theirs, but the scripts and CGIs, and IMHO, and much of the likely success/appeal of the film lies with George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. Without them, it would sink even faster than the 'Gail' - with them it stands a fair chance of steaming home. As I said - it misses, though not by as much as others this summer. 6.5 out of 10 fishermen for me.",The Perfect Storm

Acting and plot isn't the best what I have seen, but that's not the movies point - being full of movie stars and plot twists. It's catastrophe movie after all.

The Effects were great but I got a wee bit more than I bargained for in the film department as well. It's gripping, tense well acted, pretty well scripted and anyone thinking of a career in the fishing industry will surely be put off by it! What galls me though is the last 10 minutes of sentimental tagged on schmaltz. There really is no need for it, the film would work fine with being 10 minutes shorter. If you watch it you'll know what I mean but I'm not going to spoil it for you here. I thought George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg worked very well together in Three Kings and again here they seem to share a chemistry. The Supporting cast you will probably all recognise but you won't know where from. John C Reilly is like in the Thin Red Line worthy of particulary high praise. ILM have done an incredible job with the water and ships. There is a stunning brutal beauty to all of their shots not to mention an eerie realism.

I'd seen a documentary on this storm and all through the movie, I was amazed at how close the story was sticking to actual events.

They were probably making out with their significant other and were annoyed at all the interupting sound effects, thus leading them to give it a one.  
As a young very not famous filmmaker, I would classify myself under the realists.  I like movies that take as few dramatic liberties as possible; that take real events and try to tell them to a mass amount of people. One thing that I liked about this movie was it's conflict.  Very seldom in life do we have one prevailing enemy stopping us from our goals and ambitions.  Which is what makes the villians in movies like The Patriot and Gladiator seem a little bit convenient for the conflict making our leading men heroes.  Life doesn't have villains (aside from the occasion bully in school), it has people with real problems and real emotions.  The Perfect Storm grabbed me from the beginning with it's real, scruffy, weather-worn men to the gripping ending with all of these mens losses and triumphs.  The villain was life itself, and at the same time it was the hero, the vehicle that allowed these men to give and take and experience.  Good story, good storytelling, good acting, lack of over simplification and formulaic plot twists.  A solid 10 of 10.",The Perfect Storm

You went to see guys get kicked around by Nature, and that is what you get (bad choice of words, I know, after all, these are real people).  My only complaint about this movie is the way it tries to involve you with the characters.  This is not a bad idea, it was just executed terribly.  The first half-hour is obsolete, with some rather bad performances.  They try to get you involved with the characters lives and make you care about them.  And, even though these are real people, and this happened to them, I found the parts about their personal lives........uninteresting.  Especially the part with John Reily and the boy....yikes.  They should have just cut to the storm as quick as possible. But, the special effects were incredible.  Very interesting to see the way the storm was depicted.

However, the character depth was not great and of course, it was a depressing ending.Worth seeing for the special effects.

Well, the real events were: 1. there was a big storm, and 2. the boat Andrea Gail sank in it, plus we know who was aboard and a little about them. We don't know anything else about how it happened, so the story is fiction. As fiction, the movie is OK, with a lot of far-fetched action and a whole lot of big waves crashing on the boat.  One problem is that, try as the movie-makers might have, they didn't make us care about the crew.  I was more  disturbed by the waste of the fish in the hold than the loss of the boat or the crew.  If the facts suggest that they thought they could weather that storm and make it home the short way, well..., they certainly didn't use good judgement, and, sure enough, down they went.",The Perfect Storm

The most interesting part is the fact that this is a TRUE STORY. That means it really happened, which in turn mean that storms like this do exist, the most frightening thing about this movie. Other than that, it was fair. The performances by George Clooney and Mark Whalberg are, as usual, fun to watch, but not all that believable. The accents slipped here and there and the story itself was weak. However, the digital effects are great. Definitely an action movie, but I have to say, fun to watch.

Hmmm....Like most viewers, I found this movie thin on characters, but strong on effects.  It was not as Hollywood-ized as I had feared, except for the phony New England/Boston accents.  It seems rare that an actor can do one well. The dialog would be much improved if they just left the accents alone.  The movie was also 30 minutes too long... got sick of watching water and hoped they'd sink soon.  I also thought the bar scene was the most unusual collection of good looking women and ugly men I've EVER SEEN.  Realistic? About 50%!Overall?

256,Nedla24,The Perfect Snore,1,9 July 2000,"Schmaltz and special effects never mixed well in my stomach.  This movie is the perfect example of what is wrong with hollywood.  Like the similarly disappointing Gladiator the script obliterates any hope for the movie's credibility no matter how hard the director, actors, special effects team, composer, editor, and cinimatographer try to obtain it.  All the characters are two dimensional, the conjecture of what actually happened on the boat was laughable, and the dialogue is the worst I have heard in a long time. Yes the special effects are great, but when you don't care about any of the characters all thrills become as flat as a 3-day old soda. Oh, sure the writer attempts to make you care about the characters by showing a few of the most contrived scenes I have ever witnessed on a screen.  ** Possible Spoilers Ahead **  John C. Riley holding his kid before he drops him off with his estranged wife.  Clooney explaining what being a fisherboat captain means to him in an absolutely horrid monologue that the audience must sit through TWICE when it is repeated at the end.  Oh wait, I'm sorry.  This is a BOAT movie which means it can't be bad.  Whenever we see anyone with the oppourtunity to get off the boat it's irony. OOOOH!  say it with me children: I-R-O-N-Y.  So of course those people that think the beginning is boring obviously aren't catching the I-R-O-N-Y.  Yeah right.  This ploy was already overused in the similarly schmaltzy disaster epic Titanic, it doesn't need to be repeated.  ""But it's sad at the end!""  Why?  because they died?  I felt like a guy who walked into the wrong funeral at the end of this movie.  Everyone around me was teary eyed and I was saying, ""I didn't know these people!  Why should I cry?""  My biggest qualm with this movie is it's pretension.  Just because real people did die on the Andrea Gale the script becomes wrapped up in it's own self importance.  self impotence is more like it.

259,mikerichards,An almost great movie,6,31 December 2000,"I grew up in Cornwall in the SouthWest of England, it's an area with close contacts to the sea and the toll taken on those who work in boats. In 1981, the area was devastated by the loss with all hands of the local lifeboat during a colossal storm. The events portrayed in 'The Perfect Storm' should have had a great deal of resonance - unfortunately, they didn't. The movie shows Hollywoood at its best - and worst.What was good? There is no denying that the special effects steal the movie. Not only do they take computer technology to new levels, but they actually make the story possible. There is simply no way to fault the use of effects to depict an almost inconceivable event. As a showcase for the powers of ILM it can't be faulted.Secondly, the cast were well chosen for the roles. Even George Clooney sets his smirk aside and gets down to acting.But the rest is all wrong...Firstly, the script. In short, it is appalling, more deserving of a made for TV movie on a small budget than a big feature. Some of the lines are so bad that you have to laugh - even when a struggle for life and death is being depicted on screen.Secondly, the structure of the movie. It takes almost an hour to get going, far too much time is spent on the set-up or 'exploring' the characters. Unfortunately, with such a weak script, the characters can come across as cardboard cutouts taken from central casting and its hard to care about them.Thirdly, the sound. Storms are loud - granted, but the filmmakers had paid a lot of money for James Horner's score. So they pumped up the volume of the music. Then they realised that Horner's music (which has to be one of his worst scores by the way) was swamping the sound effects - so the effects were cranked up... somewhere under there is the dialogue. If you're watching this through a good home cinema system you might be able to get the voice track - in a cinema - no chance.Fourthly, the makers seemed to lack confidence in their subject. All of the events of ANDREA GAIL must be assumed to have happened - there is no evidence. So we have a crew rivalry, a shark attack, not one but two men overboard and a proposterous sequence where George Clooney tries to cut some equipment free. None of this is known to have happened, but tit had to go in to make the movie come across like a theme park ride.Finally, the ending. The movie should have ended about five minutes before it actually does. The awesome image used on the poster is taken from the scene that should have ended the film. Instead we get some of the cheesiest dialogue in the film as ANDREA GAIL sinks below the waves. The film looses its impact and descends into emotional syrup.Obviously the people at the studio didn't have enough guts to got out with a bang, perhaps they felt it would play badly in the MidWest - who knows, but perhaps a director's cut will come along one day with a less anodyne ending.In short, a missed opportunity. The people who work on the seas, those who are involved in search and rescue and their loved ones who wait back on shore deserve a better film.",The Perfect Storm

If you don't see it on the big screen, you're selling this film and yourself short - I think that for ""weather"" effects, this one may have beaten out _Twister_.  The story and the character interactions have the sense of being a little too contrived for my liking, to try and get you to feel for the characters more - but as the film progresses, the film, and the acting, more than makes up for this.But the star has to be the storm itself!

With the ""Perfect Storm"", I have witnessed a movie that makes a believer in the power of computer FX.The action and the intensity of this movie is almost mind numbing.  And the true heroics of the characters depicted is inspiring.  I was not aware that the efforts of the US Coast Guard would play such a significant role in this movie, but they are a grand addition to the story.While the computer FX are obviously, though seamlessly employed, the live action is well staged.

The Perfect Storm is one hell of a movie.  It's strengths include mind-blowing special effects, a dramatic score, and a suspenseful true story.  Let's start with the special effects.  Back in the early days of CGI it was easy to tell what was, and what wasn't.  Digital effects have come a long way since then.  The computer allows for the storm to become a big digital monster.  It is like a full-blown character created by the computer, like Jar Jar Binks.  The musical score by James Horner is spectacular.  I believe it to be the best musical score of the year so far.  The Perfect Storm is an amazing story which will keep your eyes glued and your hands clutched to the arm rests.The Perfect Storm is not ""perfect"" though.  I'm sorry, I had to.  It has a script that is far from it.  The actors look like they're really struggling to make something out of it.  Clooney especially.Still, everyone should see this movie in the theater.

They did a pretty good job of setting the scene, but everything was so obvious:  a once good fishing boat captain (George Clooney) has a losing streak and wants to prove he still has it, so he pushes further than he should (and is dour as hell as he goes about it); women don't want their men to go back to the sea; real men don't wear live preservers.The special effects were fine, but I found myself trying to figure them out rather than being concerned about what is happening to the characters in the movie.  Did anyone really care what happened to the characters?Because it was based on a true story, how did we know that they really acted this way in real life?  Maybe they cowered in the corner until their boat sank.  It's hard to believe that men of the sea were this dumb. 
Some of the best scenes involved the Coast Guard (but even they did dumb things).  Can you imagine trying to refuel a helicopter from an airplane in hurricane winds?  Or jump into a sea to save someone with 50-100 foot waves pounding all around you?  Do they really do that?  If so, I'm impressed.Probably plays much better on the silver screen than in your living room, however.",The Perfect Storm

I had a really hard time with watching this movie.  I knew 2 people that were portrayed in the movie. I saw alot of incosistencies.  I must say that I would have hated this movie even if I hadn't known anything about the story.  The special effects were cool, but come on, they can do anything now with computers.  I'm over it.  I no longer plan to attend ""special effects"" movies, just for the sake of the special effects.",The Perfect Storm
265,plonty_2000,Two hours of water hitting a window.,1,13 February 2001,"I know the majority of the reviews here have said it already, but personally I think it bears repeating: The movie is inexcusably poor.  The only way I could have enjoyed this movie less would have been if the characters had lived.  It's a terrific concept: take a bunch of jerks, throw them on a boat, and watch them act dumb and die.  Sorry, spoiler.  Too late.  You'll thank me later for saving you the trouble of sitting through it.  Annoying acting, the worst script ever, the worst child actor ever, stupid-looking fish being mutilated, and the excitement of water.  You could go on a log flume ride at Six Flags and have 79238749238472389 times as much fun.The inadequacies of my native tongue prevent me from truly expressing the extent of my hatred for this thing that sucks too much to deserve a noun that describes it and it only.  I would not deign to call it ""crap"", because I don't want to hurt the feelings of the makers of other films (such as ""Mannequin 2"") that are clearly crap but in no way as bad as this.  Not even John C. Reilly and William Fichtner can save it.  In fact, they do their best to ensure that it sucks worse than almost anything ever has, right along with everyone else involved.Without question it's extremely unfortunate that people actually died in this horrible storm, but at least now they don't have to sit through this. What a miserable, insulting epitaph.",The Perfect Storm
266,misteme2003,"Based on a true story of the loss of the ""Andrea Gail"" SPOILERS!!",8,24 October 2004,"While this movie is based on a real life occurrence of a lost fishing vessel, it was born from Sebastian Junger's book (which I did NOT read) So credit must be given where it is due. To watch a movie about a tragedy that really occurred can really affect you. That's what happened to me after watching this movie. The special effects are amazing, especially if you're watching it on a 55 inch TV with surround sound. While the movie takes you into the lives of those aboard the ""Andrea Gail"" and makes you like them, feel for them and their loved one's, it should be noted that the storm is a character in the movie as well. Considered one of the worst coastal hurricanes, it's frightening to watch, but so suspenseful, you can't help but to like it. Mother nature at it's worst. The director gives us a window into the lives of those men, whose lives were the sea who took them. George Clooney is perfect as the captain, Mark Wahlberg is fresh as one of his fisherman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio smart in her role as well as George Clooney's female counterpart. Diane Lane's role as ""the girlfriend"" really makes you want to cry, you feel her loss, her aching, her undying love for her man. For that, Ms. Lane deserves mention. I've watched this movie (own the DVD) numerous times and it never ceases to move me. It's sad and not so predictable...unless you know of the movie or book, you might not expect the ending. That's part of what makes a good movie, to be able to keep you in suspense and wondering ""what's going to happen"" or expecting a ""happy"" ending and not getting it..I give it 8/10, definitely worth getting the DVD for all the special features and true life stories.",The Perfect Storm
267,FlossieD,Do we need these smarmy endings?,6,2 July 2000,"This movie was riveting and realistic, right up to the ending, when the filmmakers copped out, once again, with loading on the smarm for the ending.

Billy Tyne, the captain of the fatefull fishing boat ""Andrea Gail"".This movie was based on a true story and if you dont want to know the ending of the movie (which i did but was shocked) stop reading. All cast members were top notch, and were in fine form, John C Reily who usually plays mean characters was a goody in this one and. The best performance was probably from Diane Lane as Wahlberg's girlfriend.There wasnt a lot of violence, only one or two scences, but the action and special effects were brilliant.9/10",The Perfect Storm
269,harrymccormack1981,Great action but lacks depth.,6,27 November 2011,"Wolfgang Petersen's film is based on real-life events of a fleet of swordfish boat crew aboard from Gloucester, Massachussets caught in a massive super-storm after drifting beyond their usual fishing grounds in an ambitious attempt to take advantage of the rich availability of swordfish in that area. Their last trip was a financial disaster so the aim is to make up for it this time round.George Clooney stars as ""Andrea Gail"" captain Billy Tyne while Mark Wahlberg co-stars as rookie Bobby Shatford while Michael Ironside supports as boat owner Bob Brown.The fantastic cast also includes Diane Lane, John C Reilly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and William Fichtner.If you want great action sequences this is your kind of film.My criticism however is lack of depth of characters. Clooney's character isn't explored enough and apart from Wahlberg/Lane, this can be said for most of the characters here.Bob Gunton and Karen Allen appear later on as members of a yacht caught in the storm but they aren't given much to do and much of the dialogue is pretty average and clichéd (pretty odd for a film based on a true story).In conclusion this film could have been better as with the explanation above but watching the film is a far cry away from being a waste of time. The action sequences are terrific and the suspense grabs you in thick of it. Worth a look.",The Perfect Storm
270,Laurie Mann,"Perfect Special Effects, Needed a Better Script and Editing",7,23 July 2000,"This is probably the best special effects movie ever. Most of the time, you can spot a special effect a mile away.  The effects in this film are superbly combined so you can't tell where the tank waves end and the digital waves begin.As for the script, it had the details right, Diane Lane's accent was spot-on, and the cast had the look of fisherman. But the writer felt obligated to work in unnecessary details (the meteorologist, too much time worrying about the yacht and the Coast Guard, not nearly enough time with the wonderful supporting cast), and then the director and editor failed to cut these things out.Mostly, I recommend this movie as a very good movie, but not a great one.",The Perfect Storm

I refuse to insult the actors or techs behind this production, the producers' on the other hand should've known better.

The story is simple,Familiar gruff guys against nature... It's ""Twister"" with FISH. The acting was as good as could be expected, seeing as how they were given lines that would make a child groan. ""Batman"" and ""Brock Landers"" spat out there diologue with tongue in cheek. There were many moments that had me in uncontrolled laughter...Most of it was too stupid to be taken seriously : I cant recommend this film for the action, the special effects, geez, anything... So I guess I have to give this film a 1 out of 10. The 1 is for the only suprise in the film, an unexpected shark attack that was very exciting, and the only major action sequence that was free of the horrible music score...(shame on you James Horner,shame!!!)SAVE YOUR MONEY",The Perfect Storm

The plot seems convoluted in relation to the actual events, but....this IS Hollywood, is it not? Some of the CGI tends to throw this film off, but if you can get by that, and the fact that the story has been modified for audiences, then you might actually get a kick out of watching this.Clooney is not really convincing throughout. He just didn't sell me. Wahlberg was adequate. There was only one crew member who I thought even remotely portrayed a New Englander, and that was John Hawkes as Bugsy. The rest of the characters were stiff, and seemingly uncomfortable in their roles. In other words, I just couldn't ""attach"" myself to these characters. Hell, they could've at least worked on the New England accent, which is sometimes so strong, you have to really listen to ""hear"" what's being said! (I know, I'm from the area.) My sympathies to those on whom the story is based. It's a shame their legacies weren't aptly portrayed in this film.Still, it wasn't absolutely horrible.

274,70mm MAN,We All walked out on this One!!!,1,23 July 2000,"I am 52 years old and have loved movies all my life. There have been only 3 movies I have went to see that were so terrible that I got up and left the theater without making it to the end. I saw it on opening night. When we left I said ""stop"" ""I want to count heads."" There were only 7 people left in a sold out show!! The next day I was so shocked at the comments and reviews that I went with a second group of people and tried to watch it again, hoping perhaps I just had an ""off"" day. It was worse the 2nd time. I have never seen such poor film work ever. Soon into the movie I assumed the film was ""matted"" wide-screen because I saw many scenes with the characters foreheads cut off at about the hairline. I was stunned when one of the big waves hit the boat and knocked the main boom over. I thought I was watching an old 60's Godzilla movie. And then as the perfect ""tri-wave"" storm begins pounding the boat the scene moves to the inside of the ship. The crew is anxiously deciding what to do. They are SLOWLY LEANING from side to side. And behind them, outside of the main windows are these 40 or 50 foot waves slamming down just feet from the ship. Nothing on the tables are moving etc. etc. This is not to mention that the scenes were too chaotic to really see what was going on. They also were shot in deep brownish hues that were far from natural. That's not even getting to the fact that there is never an attempt to develop any of the characters. And the acting was ""B"" movie horrific. When both my groups left, after about an hour or more, I made the comment that ""I hope this boat crashes and takes everything with it, especially the film reels at the theater."" I then recanted and said ""I don't even care what happens to anybody in this movie."" If you want to see a good movie on the perfect storm, watch the ""White Squall"" or ""Wind"". Don't even waste your money on renting the video. I love George Clooney, but not here. I also want to note that I was hoping that at a 2nd theater, the movie at would at least display a proper aspect ratio. ""Maybe the first show had over-scanned the projection so as to cut off the tops and bottoms of scenes"". I was wrong. It was just as terribly displayed there. It is either being played back in 35 MM, matted to give us the 2:35 to 1 appearance of 65 or 70MM. Or it is just a terrible Camera man's eye for the scope of the viewer. Boy, I am sorry I am so negative, but this movie was that bad. I have heard many other comments from people who completely agree with me. Simply, one of the worse movies we've seen. And I like almost all movies in some way or another. Except ""The Perfect Storm""!",The Perfect Storm

Incredibly bad dialogue, extremely forced character development; although, what do you expect--there simply wasn't a story here other than a boat went down in a really bad storm.  Glad I didn't pay to even RENT it--I got it at the library on DVD for free and was able to watch the lame subtitles on double-speed.",The Perfect Storm
276,Madcapsjs,I Should have Brought My Dramamine...,7,8 July 2000,"Wow...what a cool movie.  My usual philosophy is, ""don't believe the hype"" but in this case I did (I'm also marking out for X-Men). 
What is the # 1 rule in writing a book or in making a film?  I don't know either...but a good place to start is in making people CARE about your characters.  Critics take shots at this movie because it takes some time to set up and show us the lives of the fishermen on the Andrea Gail...NEWS FLASH...if I didn't care about them, why would I care if they lived or died during the storm?  I was raised just off Cape Cod...I had lots of friends who lived near me whose grandfathers, fathers, uncles, cousins, etc...were fishermen.  This movie does them justice by showing that it ain't a glam-type life...it's backbreaking work (avg 15-20 hr days).  It's also a roll of the dice as to whether or not you'll make any money, let alone survive.  The critics who have made a living sitting on their dead asses sticking pins in other people's balloons have no idea what ""real"" work is like. 
Is the movie perfect?  Heck, no...it's got a few ""hmmmmm"" moments...but, overall, it's a great story, with a great cast doing justice to the memory of all the fishermen/fisherwomen who never made it back to tell the tale themselves.  Oh, and to the critics who rag on the actors concerning their accents, I lived in Mass the first 14 years of my life and I STILL talk that way 16 years later...am I faking it too?  Anywho, this is just my humble opinion...spend 6 bucks or whatever and judge for yourself.  I had a great time and almost puked because of how realistic it felt.  When that 100 foot wave (like in the poster) rolls in...I stopped breathing.  I also suggest you read the book by Sebastian Junger.  The section where he goes into detail about the physics of drowning will make you afraid to drink a glass of water.

277,jpd-5,A Ship of Fools sets Sail,2,6 January 2001,"(warning spoilers)There are very few things I liked about this movie.  I would have hit the eject button, but I kept waiting for it to get good.  It didn't.The special effects in this movie are realistic enough to cause sea sickness.  There are few situations more fearsome as a major storm at sea. Which is the reason several hundred other vessels avoided the storm in the first place.  Am I all alone in viewing the ill fated crew as greedy and stupid?  The ""Andrea Gail"" was beyond the reach of the storm when the crew decided to sail into the storm in a malfunctioning fishing trawler.  Not too bright.I did not care for the story or the character development.  Which left me feeling nothing when they all perished.  Guess they never heard of Personal Flotation Devices.This movie could have been improved by spending some of the budget on writers, rather than cast and special effects.  The famous cast only had cliches and dull dialog.  Or throw in a Sci-Fi twist and have U-96 surface and fire a couple torpedos into the ""Andrea Gale"".  Almost anything would have improved this film.The heroic efforts of the unsung heroes of the U.S. Coast Guard are portrayed.  I'm just sorry the Coast Guard has to risk their lives to rescue the sail boat crew.By the way, I do not intend any disrespect to the real life crew, as quite likely they were caught in the storm and did not choose to sail into harms way.  We don't know what really happened to them, but this movie places them in an unflattering light.",The Perfect Storm

While no one but the crew of the Andrea Gail knows exactly what happened that fatefull night after she lost radio contact, events from other storms and other fishing trips can be used to give some idea. This has got to be one of my favorite movies, George Clooney, Mark Whalburg and the rest of the cast deliver powerful performances in their respective roles. The special effects are like none I have ever seen, blending CGI with live action, and water effects. It is a story of human nature, love, and the risks and rewards that fishermen take on a day to day basis. I could go on and on arguing the points and explaining various things but this is supposed to be a movie review not a discussion board. Long story short this is a moving film, it will have you on the edge of your seat once the storm sets in and the boat tries to tackle her. Just watching the film and being in no danger myself I cant imagine the terror the crew must have gone through that night, and the bravery of the coast guard helicopter crew that had to ditch.

284,angrytexan,"Devoid of good acting, character development, emotion, the list goes on...",3,28 December 2000,"This movie is a failed attempt at melding special effects and decent character interaction.  The only good scenes were the computer generated images of the waves, and even those got old after a while.  Here's 10 reasons why I hated this movie.10. Based on a true story?! How could anyone know what anyone said at any moment after the boat shipped off? It appears to me that they took a few names, like the name of the boat, and threw them in  a entirely fictional plot.  Don't try to fool intelligent folk like me into pouring unnecessary emotion into a Clooney film!9. George Clooney.  Another botched run at portraying a grizzled old tough guy.  And where was HIS Bostonian accent?  Just like Costner in Robin Hood--totally out of his element.8. The Captain's time-to-accept-my-fate-and-remain-in-the-cabin-while-the-boat-goes-under scene. Anyone with the serenity and presence of mind to accept death while he's short on air doesn't belong on a fishing boat; he should be stealing military secrets from the Commies or something.  There's always hope on the surface...Bobby would have realized that too before trying to communicate with his wife/girlfriend/whatever via some romantic telepathy.7. The weekenders.  What the heck were they doing in this movie?6. The portrayal of the Coast Guard.  Please.  They protect our coast...we should give them a little more credit than that.  And we know most of that was made up.5. All those landlubbers.  It seemed that everyone who wasn't on the boat suffered from bad-acting disease.  And spare me the age-old love/hate cliches.4. ""She's not gonna let us out."" One wave?! One wave traveling in the opposite direction of all the others?! They see a break in the clouds and heavenly light pouring down and JUST THEN the writers decide to end the movie.  Right.  A little abrupt for my tastes.3. The bogus tension between Sully and Murph.  Maybe I missed its origin altogether, but it seemed to come out of nowhere.  It served no purpose in the plot and was quickly resolved.  The creators of the movie were fooling themselves if they thought that this sub-plot had any meaning.2. Lack of emotional attachment to the fishermen.  I wanted to feel sorry for Murph's family but I didn't.  Same with Bobby's wife.  I just didn't care. Why? Poor acting and sub-par character development.  Or maybe it was the fact that their untimely deaths were the most out-of-place of all the many movies I've seen.1. FIFTY FOOT WAVES. Is a couple tons of fish worth their lives? NO!  I'm sure the real incident wasn't a matter of ""Aw, screw it! Let's take on the hurricane! We'll have a couple grand when we're done! Hurrah, hurrah!""The Perfect Storm, to me, was the retirement home version of Twister.  It showed me the potential of a DVD player, but little more.  And a Wolfgang Petersen (no relation) movie, no less! Outbreak was cool, Air Force One rocked. Of course, they featured Dustin Hoffman and Harrison Ford. I guess that just goes to show that prominent actors can make or break a movie.",The Perfect Storm

286,gregg-39,Unrealistic and often dull!!,5,13 July 2001,"The main criticism I have of this film is the lack of realism, especially in a film who emphasizes how it is ""based"" on a true story.  This comes twofold in the atmosphere of the film, character, script e.t.c., and also in the technical aspects of the story and events, admittedly I am not an expert on the subject but things 'seem' too extreme and impossible and are often in direct contradiction to facts I do know from having watched documentaries on various related subjects e.g. survival in stormy sea circumstances.  But I will discuss the latter bit later.I feel a major problem in many films is the fake 'professionalism' that comes through the script and the acting(especially American, although I get the impressions they often try to look more intense than British people in everything they do).  What I mean by this is that everyone is always focused entirely on their job at hand and every communication made is formal and direct and militant.  This is unnatural and to a large extent unprofessional. In our everyday jobs generally the better we get the less we need direct communication, especially in some of the monotonous tasks we saw being performed here.  I doubt sailors are constantly throwing each other orders and telling each other unnecessary things, like 'shift that fish' when they are offloading fish, pretty bloody obvious especially when you do it every day huh. Because the film is trying to build up to a big event, it is constantly over-emphasizing every little thing that people do and we don't have a sense that these fishermen have been at the job for very long, in a community that has always revolved around fishing, a boat coming in would be unlikely to receive a greeting reminiscent of a POW whose family have once again met after years of torture, but these sailors do.  Don't get me wrong, there is danger involved but it is more everyday to the fishermen. The worst thing in the entire film however is the bloody music, ever present and trying to turn every conversation into a moving dramatic speech. Some film people need to learn that fact-based human drama and epic sweeping story's DO NOT MIX.In terms of the accuracy that I mentioned earlier, to say this is supposedly the worst storm last century it takes a lot to kill anyone.  people in the water still capable of swimming despite currents that can topple huge 100ft boats, amazing recoveries from hooks through the hands. **SPOILER** One thing that did confuse me, although I would expect the researchers and advisors to be accurate on this was the rescue men jumping in the water and then getting in the cage that was lowered down, it seemed dumb enough to jump down in the first place because people can not swim effectively in water like that, surely.The special effects were good although Mr Petersons huge praise about the advances in ability seems excessive, especially since it can't be hard to make the CGI and real water blend together when its dark, mostly one colour and moves and changes form so rapidly. One rather laughable part, other than the script, is the attempt to make the actors seem more ruff' and ready by simply having a bit of scraggy hair on the blokes chins, I'm sorry but Mark Wahlberg and co. (minus perhaps Clooney) had lovely soft skin and it showed, even rookie laborers like Wahlberg's character are tough because they grow up in these environments.Altogether not a terrible film, but not good either.  Ignoring the court cases surrounding it this film doesn't do the many fishermen around the world any favours.",The Perfect Storm
287,bahrom1,perfectly mediocre,5,26 March 2001,"I just caught The Perfect Storm on TV and it reminded me why I didn't like it much the first time I saw it when it just came out. A lot was made at the time of the fact that the film is based on a true story and many other reviews mention this. But being based on a true story adds nothing to the quality of any film by itself; it's an interesting tidbit but is quite irrelevant to how good a movie is. In the case of The Perfect Storm it might have even been a detractor. It stifles the plot which becomes predictable (I would even say boring) with several plot lines underdeveloped and leading nowhere.I'm sure everybody knows the plot by now so I don't think I'll spoil it but the whole plot can be summarized very simply as follows: there were some fishermen who got caught in a huge storm and died. that's it. if you think about it nothing else needs to be added to cover anything that happens. In my opinion there needs to be more than that to make a story interesting and engaging.The acting is actually quite good by just about everybody. George Coolney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, John C. Reiley, William Fichtner and others all deliver solid performances. But it sadly feels like a waste of effort in a movie that lacks a message and ends up being just depressing. 5 out of 10.",The Perfect Storm

George Clooney sheds his suave image to play a grizzled fishing boat captain with more than a touch of Captain Ahab about him, and Mark Wahlberg is so good you forget he was ever in a boy band.

290,bandimal,The Inside Story,8,10 September 2000,"This movie is not just about ""the perfect storm.""  It is about the struggle to win battles and win wars, internally and externally.  While we don't know what exactly the crew of the Andrea Gail did in those last fateful hours, Sebastian Junger and Wolfgang Peterson have done a wonder to piece together what *might* have happened.  In their hands, the men fight amongst each other for honor and then fight together for their lives.  The battles they win against the sea are triumphant and with the special effects it is easy for the viewer to feel as if he or she is right there on the boat pumping fists along with them.  Unfortunately for the Andrea Gail this was a case of battles won and the war lost.  However the movie itself is a moving tribute to the men, even as they remain in their watery grave.",The Perfect Storm
291,Melvin-8,A motion Picture Masterpiece,10,22 July 2000,"First of all: ***Spoilers***The film was amazing. Petersen is not only an excellent Action-Movie Director, but aDirector who can depict great emotions on the silver screen. There are many people saying this movie is stupid in aspect ofstoryline and acting. My Question to those out there is: Are you sure you can understand Acting-Movies with a great storyline? Hollywood makes these movies or forces Directors to cut down their movies to these types of films for.....stupid audiences. An Example is Contact. It had a phenomenal cast and a brilliant storyline but 'guess what?' nobody saw it.It forced people'sbrain mass to much, I guess. But back to this movie. It has great special effects a nearlyperfect soundmix(I hope that these two will get a  nomination) on the technical side and a good cast. Everybody saying that this movie is boring has either watched abootleg copy on his cheesy VCR or saw it in a very low-tech Cinema. In this case I guess that every Action-Drama could be considered as boring. Maybe some of you will laugh but I also hope that the Director will get a nomination. It was far more shocking and realistic than Spielberg's work on 'Saving'. And that's what this film is all about. Spielberg is a Master in directing Popcorn flicks. But when it comes to more serious topics he fails. 'Schindlers list'(although a very good film) was full of stereotypes(even against Jews) as was 'Saving'. Petersen can do Popcorn-Flicks(Outbreak, Air Force One) and serious Character-Films(In the line of Fire, Das Boot). A by doing this film he achieved one nearly impossible thing: He did a Character-Film within a Popcorn-Flick. As I mentioned before i think that it was cut down to apeal more to american audiences. I am looking forward to a Directors Cut. Watch it!",The Perfect Storm

First of all it is extremely boring, the script was horrible with many cheesy lines like, ""STOP!!! You're heading into the monster!!!!"" and I was quite disappointed in the films acting.

George Clooney is good as the veteran captain of the ship and Mark Wahlberg is impressive in the role of the beginner Bobby. The effects of this film is superb and the powerful music makes the storm even bigger and more scarier.

296,Robin_Hood,Clooney gives his all in storming depressant.,8,24 November 2000,"Active, exciting, moving...depressing.  I have so many mixed emotions about this movie due to realising that more or less everything we see is true. George Clooney perfectly captures the busy, yet quite lonely man, that was Billy Tyne.  Mark Whalberg, who supported Clooney in 'Three Kings', also gives an excellent performance as Bobby Shatford.  The movie, on a whole, succeeds where a lot of films this year have - it's gripping.  The whole scenario of the storm, the crew, the boat and the relationships are so scarily captivating it's unreal.  However, if you don't know the ending or what goes on in the film, i won't say anything, but be warned!  This film has scarred my mind.  The performances from all actors are so good, i was depressed for about 3 days afterwards!  That is the only weakness however. It's a great film a really worth watching.  I would also recommend the book to anyone who hasn't read it - A bloody good read, although even that has it's depressing moments.  8/10 - worth purchasing because it could effectively become a classic.",The Perfect Storm
297,selfedluke,Unexpected Flop,4,23 June 2020,"'Das Boot' (Wolfgang Peterson's first ocean based drama) is my favorite movie of all time and a towering classic of cinema regarding its 10/10 pacing, tension, atmosphere, grit, and cinematography.That being said, I expected another ocean-drama movie coming from Peterson to be at least an 8/10 (Great). What we got instead was a painfully average movie-- awesome in select scenes but mostly boring and packed with ineffective creative decisions.This movie is a case study for how ""average"" a movie can become even with a killer cast and crew. Usually this happens because of business-minded producers butting in and changing everything. In this case I'm not sure if that's what happened or if Peterson simply let his chops down on this one.First off, the score really bogs this thing down. It's incredibly over the top. It sticks out like crazy for a movie about average-guy fishermen caught in a storm. I think the movie would have been a lot more tense/gritty/real if they replaced it with low-volume risers and eerie fill. Instead, they pack nearly every scene with the same two tracks that make it sound like these men are 18th century explorers racing back to Spain to deliver water from the fountain of youth. It's simply too epic/orchestral/deep for what it needs to be and Peterson never mixes it up with new sound, just these two main scores over and over again.Second, the overall direction/focus of the plot seemed incoherent. The entire first half of the movie was about the men's love lives back in MA (and too much of it was unrealistic overly poetic and lovey-dovey soap opera dialogue if you ask me). Then the second half details the men's fishing expedition, but cuts many times to a sub-plot of a coast guard crew loosing their helicopter at sea (funny enough this is the most gripping part of the movie). Only the final 20ish minutes display the actual disaster the movie was supposed to be about. Breaking up plot-lines isn't always a bad idea, but it just falls flat in The Perfect Storm... the intense love-filled first half was cheesy and ultimately poorly integrated into the second half. Nothing wrong with romance obviously, but in a disaster movie it should be the secondary or derivative focus that makes you more invested in the characters. Here it tries to be the main plot only to remember that it is actually a disaster men-at-sea movie 60 minutes later.Third, the acting/relationship between the crewmen. Virtually all of the time they barely interacted other than to boringly discuss their love interests back home or experiences sailing. And the fight between the two crewmen is particularly lame and drawn out and just poorly written.",The Perfect Storm
298,maxlebow,A Parable - Men vs. Death,9,8 March 2006,"By the time most people saw this film in a theater, or rented it, they already knew the ship would sink and its crew would be dead in less than two hours.Surprisingly, this diminishes not one whit from the film's power. Even on several viewings, the film never betrays a moment that is false, maudlin, or sentimental. The plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film. It is the issue. How do people face death? In this film, the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know their job, commercial fishing, is difficult and dangerous, even in good weather. The weather is rainy. The men need the money. They go out even though they know they will meet a storm. They are used to risking their lives every day. Few people appreciate how dangerous it is to deliver that fish entrée to the table.The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men, plays rough with them, and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat, they face death squarely. They talk, briefly, and unsentimentally, about things they will not be able to do, people they will miss. The stark, plainness of the acting achieves a powerful emotional effect.At the beginning of the film, the viewer meets the crew. On multiple viewings, the film reveals nothing milked -- nothing artificial. The men are solid, working people. There is no sappy foreshadowing.Director deserves kudos, for maintaining tight-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy, or worse.The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology, especially about hurricanes. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action.All the actors, including George Clooney, maintain a stoic, engagement with life, and they struggle to live, with no appeal to our pity, until they die.The Perfect Storm is more than a film. It is a parable.",The Perfect Storm
299,V Hanna,What a wave!,8,31 July 2000,"That last wave was what I was waiting for. The shear size of its on screen appearance was enough to raise the hairs on my neck during previews back in January. The Perfect Storm was a fun movie to watch. Yes you know going in that death will be involved but it is the ride on the Andrea Gail with the weathered fishermen that make this movie worth while. The carry over chemistry from Three Kings between Whalberg and Clooney is magic. It is rare when you truly see two actors really connect the way they do and it can only be seen with careful attention. To make this movie shine like a star Wolfgang needed more character development. But since this was slated to be a summer movie, and as we know summer movies rarely dig deeper than a Colorado detective with a fresh cup of coffee, I felt satisfied with its presentation. There was so much within the characters that only scratched the surface of the pain and frustration they have all dealt with in their lives. But I also take into account who was the real star of the show. Like the shark in Jaws the storm was here. The scenes involving the storm where intense and exhilarating.",The Perfect Storm

But, again, it's about the storm and it's exciting enough that, well, it's sorta worth the money.  True, I often couldn't hear what they were saying and I left feeling something was missing, but it's entertaining enough that I wasn't sorry I went.

During the terrible and long storm scenes, the camera was jerking around too much.  If The Blair Witch Project gave you headaches, after you see this, your head will feel like it is in a clamp.

This film from a pacing perspective is extremely well done. At the begging it's slow but funny and light hearted. We get to see the humanity in these characters and what their home life looks like. Then as the storm brews the film itself brews up a faster pace. I like the different plot lines intermixing with the three people on the sailboat who need rescuing, the coast guard rescue teams, the families of our main characters back home and of course our main characters who are lead by Clooney and Wahlberg. One thing I really liked about the film was how it felt like a love letter to those who love sailing and the ocean as well. I think that was a nice touch to all of those fisherman who have died out at sea to pay them respect. Overall without getting to much into details this film made me cry, and I look forward to watching it again.",The Perfect Storm
305,Topgallant,Ocean Melodrama with Great Acting and Not Much Reality,7,18 November 2009,"Not that it was a bad movie, or lacked drama and good characterization, but there were enough technical inaccuracies to cause this mariner trouble.First of all, let's ask some questions: Why were the outriggers out and the paravanes down when the seas were in the 80' to 150' foot range (as depicted; more if you consider the last wave)? Why did the crew wait so long to batten down the wheelhouse windows? They knew the storm was coming. They knew how bad it would be. Why didn't they make proper preparations to meet it? Why wasn't the crew in the wheelhouse? I've been in some bad blows, and when it gets really bad, everybody usually hangs out in the wheelhouse with their survival suits within arm's reach. When it's that bad, and the boat has to turn around in monster seas, riding out the turn in the fo'c's'le or galley is the last thing anybody wants to do.Why would anyone think they could remount a SSB antenna in a 50 knot wind when the smallest whip antenna is about 23'? If the antenna doesn't rip your arm off, how are you going to splice the coax? And why not just lay out an emergency long wire antenna on deck? Speaking of which: I thought the Andrea Gail had a long wire antenna and not a whip antenna. I believe that in the photo of the Hannah Boden, which Linda Greenlaw states is a sistership of the Andrea Gail, you can see a long wire antenna running aft from the masthead to the goal post.By the way, Greenlaw states in her book that her boat, the Hannah Boden, was 100'. Sebastion Junger, the author of the book, stated on a pre-movie hype news program that the Andrea Gail was 80'. I tend to believe Greenlaw over Junger regarding LOA. And I tend to believe it had a long wire antenna. You'd think it would given its range of operation. Also, if the boat was 100' , the wave at the end would have been about 200'. My understanding is that the largest non-seismic wave ever recorded was 112', measured scientifically in the North Pacific by researchers aboard the USS Ramapo on February 7th, 1933.Also....Where can I get one of those blow torches that stays lit after it gets dunked in seawater? Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie. I liked the effects. I thought the film makers did some good things. But I don't think the movie paid homage to the crew of the Andrea Gail or commercial fishermen. I think Junger's melodramatic overspeculations of the sinking (not to mention his speculation about what it's like to drown) are an insult to the thousands of fishermen and other seafarers who've lost their limbs and worse in much less spectacular ways. In truth, the vast majority of commercial fishing accidents and sinkings, aren't caused by gigantic Hollywood waves. They're the result of separate incidents and seemingly insignificant details stacking-up and falling like a house of cards.With all due respect to the people of Gloucester and the friends and family of those who died on the Andrea Gail, and to the film makers and the actors, I humbly submit a different cause and effect scenario with regard to the sinking.In my opinion, had the crew been given the time depicted in both the book and the movie, the ending might have been quite different. Those men were experienced and capable fisherman who had previously handled anything the sea had thrown at them. What probably happened was they started home with a freighted boat. It got rough, very rough, and the vessel started taking on water, probably from some insidious place in the stern, e.g. the rudder box or shaft seal. They didn't know she was taking on water until it was too late, at which time the vessel rolled and sank before they could launch the raft, get into their survival suits, or trigger the EPIRB. How many times has it happened that way? A freighted boat. A slow leak. Bad weather.Of course, the enormous wave makes for greater popcorn fun.",The Perfect Storm

The effects are amazing.I had to give this an 8 though, because the maudlin acting of the first 20 minutes made me want to go get my blood sugar checked, it was that sickly sweet. I understand the need to want to get story across about the people involved and their families, but the overly dramatic and schmaltzy acting in the beginning, along with James Horner's heavy handed score, really turned me off for a while. But the minute the boat set sail, I was hooked.Overall, I really liked the movie.

The character which the audience believes the most is indeed, the ocean.  Each human in the movie is disposable while the storm has a life of its own.  I'm glad there was no footage of the storm ending, because to see it die would have broken my heart.  Usually flicks with nothing more than top-notch FX ruin themselves by trying to make us love everything about them.  ""Storm,"" on the other hand, knows that we don't have many feelings towards the characters and so Peterson focuses on nothing more than the 100 foot waves, and this fact makes ""Storm"" a good popcorn flick.

Since no one lived to tell about it, there is no way to know what REALLY happened, and to make a movie, you need to make it interesting.That having been said, I enjoyed the movie. I knew the whole time that it was all conjecture mixed with the reality that there would be no survivors.
I give this movie praise on a few levels. I believed in the characters, the acting was wonderful! Having huge gusts of water thrown in your face at a high rate and staying in character showed through here.Not all of the effects were brilliant, but they added to the story and gave you the visuals you needed.I think it was filmed very well.I remember that storm... it was devastating to this area...So... if you can keep in mind that there is no one to truly tell the story.. then you can enjoy it for what it's worth.

I must say that despite the fact that the book is ALWAYS better than the movie, the movie really does hold its own.Granted, the film makers took a few more liberties than Junger did not take in the book, but that is the nature of movie making I suppose.  I only have one complaint, though.  In the movie, the storm seemed to happen all at once and the rescues seemed to kind of blend into one another after a while. In reality, the whole ordeal was a little more spread out over time.

320,JakeSpy,Perfect example of formula summer fare,6,30 June 2000,"I went to both of the July Fourth blockbusters this week--The Patriot on Wednesday and The Perfect Storm on Friday.  Both films played to the formula for their respective genres.  The Patriot shines as an example of a film that works well within its formula, thanks in large part to Mel Gibson's performance.  Unfortunately, The Perfect Storm left me feeling completely ambivalent about what had happened on screen.  This film is nothing more than an exercise in groundbreaking visual effects set to a roaring soundtrack and James Horner's standout score.  The opening half gives us the usual mix of cliche-ridden eclectic characters and corny dialogue.  As they set out to sea, we know very little of who these men are and what they leave behind.  This matter is worsened by almost hollow performances from every person on the boat and largely scream and cry exercises from the cast of loved ones left to watch the Weather Channel and sip beer at the local bar. 
So when the storm does hit, there is nothing left to do but watch and marvel at the show.  The characters are largely indistinguishable from one another throughout most of the storm sequences and, sadly, it wouldn't matter if we saw what was happening to who.  When the film moves to the rescue of a sail boat and a coast guard helicopter crew, characters who are never introduced in the story, we care even less than we do for the crew of the Andrea Gail. 
The film rings hollow and empty at the end when it shouldn't.  Even more insulting is that this movie is based on a true story. But you wouldn't know that watching this film filled with cut-out characters who are more flimsy than the boats tossed about by the Perfect Storm.",The Perfect Storm

I gave it an 8 out of 10 only because like all action movies, they start out slow to give some depth to their characters since they will be focusing on special effects and suspense for the remainder of the movie.  However once the movie got cooking, it didn't stop and it wasn't an empty special effects movie with no plot like Twister or Mission Impossible 2.  Of course it was based on a true story but the characters made you feel for them and their lot in life and it truly was a movie that rocked.  By all means go see it and enjoy.",The Perfect Storm
322,James McK,Slow start... but Oh Lord when that storm starts blowing,6,5 July 2000,"I'd read the reviews before I saw the film, so I was prepared for bad dialouge (hey, it's a disaster film) I was prepared for weak characters and I was prepared for the slow build up, I was prepared to see amazing visual affects and hopefully some excellent action (this from Wolfgang Peterson, cause hey, I liked Air Force One!). No one told me the build up was that long, its 40 minutes till that boat even hits the water let alone it being past the one hour mark before that storm comes in. Yes, I know it was character building- but most of it was so superfluous that it was just boring, and in the end, not much character was developed, only, situation, and that could have taken half the time....BUT OH LORD ONCE THAT STORM STARTS BLOWING. Computer digital effects have never truly impressed me since Jurassic Park, no major foward steps have been made since then. Until now, the clouds, the waves, the spray, while of course not totally believable, were jaw dropping, amazing, and in context with the storyline, terrifying. Once that storm kicks in its just drawdropping and I was terrified, and suspended... that boat, those waves, you just have to see it, on the big screen believe me, it is truly freaky stuff. And Peterson can handle the action scenes, such as the piece with the out of control anchor, and lets not forget the Coastguard scenes, never before have I seen people, and their technology, so frail, compared to the raw power of nature.Yes, some of the dialouge is truly banal, the character situations such as the feud between two of the fishermen, and again, thrills are along time in the coming, but when they come, they come, and the development at the start does come in handy, these are after all real characters, and despite some two-dimensionality, we must sub-consciously feel for them, and their plight. To know it is true, that makes it all the more moving, and all the more scary.On the other hand, when the credits began to roll, and the lights came up, my friend beside me said ""Didn't that suck"". So there you go.",The Perfect Storm
323,supergiantbugkiller,ouch,1,19 January 2001,"simply put, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. And i sat through the Postman *AND* Waterworld. The Perfect Bore would have been a better title. The one and only worthwhile moment in this film was hearing Clooney scream (with feeling): ""I BRING THE FISH!!!! SO DON'T F*CK WITH ME!!"" or something like that. Of course i was barely paying attention at the time, as my fingernails had become my main source of entertainment at that point. Damnit George, what the hell were you thinking. This movie wasn't even 'funny' bad. It was just plain painful.",The Perfect Storm
324,scarfin-06111,This storm was far from perfect but would receive high marks for stupidity.,3,17 October 2021,"It has been twenty-one years since the movie ""The Perfect Storm"" was released in theatres and I finally sat down to watch it last night. I stayed away from this movie because I have lost eight family members to the sea overa four year period who were on fishing boats that also sank during storms.I also spent eight years on a fishing boat similar to the Andrea Gail and another fifteen years on a Canadian Coast Guard Search and Rescue ship, so I have also seen my fair share of storms with very high winds and heavy seas. I only mention this to show I have experience working on the sea and will provide the most honest review that I can.The movie itself is based on true events that occurred during the storm of October, 1991 -(Hurricane Grace) and because all crew members lost their lives on the Andrea Gail, there is no way for anyone to know exactly what happened on the day she went down.As I watched the movie, I was astonished as to how irresponsible Billy Tyne was portrayed, since he was shown to be a ruthless captain who didn't care about his men because he was having a sting of bad luck with fishing. Since no-one knows for sure what happened, Tyne could have easily been portrayed as a frustrated man but still treated his men with respect. That in itself would have been a wonderful memory for his family.The script is really good in some instances while really ridiculous in others. The weatherman stating ""This Doesn't Look Good"" is an indication to the viewer that bad weather was on the horizon which is what you would expect and be considered a normal reaction. The interaction between Bobby's girlfriend and his mother was wonderful to watch because it showed the compassion humans have for one another some of the time.In other instances the script was just so unbelievable, I actually laughed at some of it.For example, a whale is pulled on deck that rips a hole in one of the crewman's boot and scratches his leg and the crew is joking about it; a hook goes through the hand of one of the fishermen and he gets dragged overboard, yet does not drown with all that pressure on his lungs as he is being pulled further down, then amazingly he is able to return to work in no time with no ill effects; crew members jumping off the boat to retrieve the other fisherman who fell overboard and was able to push against the current and they too survived.Also crew members falling into the water but even with the huge waves surrounding the boat they do not float away from it and are rescued; another crew member attempting to repair the radio antenna, falls but manages to grab onto the railing with wet fingers on one hand while the boat is being tossed about and he is not injured; captain Tyne is dragged under the waves while using a torch to cut the cable on the stabilizer but does not fall off as the stabilizer as it is bouncing straight up above deck and slams back down into the ocean.Then the crew after fighting with the plywood trying to close up the windows were all standing in the wheelhouse where captain Tyne wax telling them they had to turn around. As they were talking there were huge waves rolling down but the boat barely moved and not even a spoonful of water entered the wheelhouse. How is this even possible? I just couldn't believe the writer and director would be so far from reality that they thought they could pass this off as a possibility.All these listed in the three paragraphs above are not just outrageous but utter stupidity and it really upsets me to think they could pass these off as feasible when anyone with any common sense should know these just aren't possible. Although this movie was created to honour the men of the Andrea Gail, I personally think the movie made a mockery out of them.What saddens me about all of this is how the entire crew was portrayed at times to be like little children especially when something went terribly wrong. This is not a reaction you would expect from someone so far from civilization. There is an old saying among some fisherman that reads ""When one terrible thing happens on a fishing trip you thank your lucky stars, If two things happen on the same trip you thank god above, but if three or more things happen on a trip, you will be shaking hands with the lord"" but this does not apply to what was shown in this movie.Many people said we need to watch this movie for what it is because there is no way to know for sure what happened to the boat and crew. I say that is true, but, there was such an opportunity to show these men in a way that even people who never stepped onto a fishing boat still would be able to relate. I stayed away from watching this for twenty-one years and now I wish I never turned it on. This movie could have been so much better because there was no need to show all of those ridiculous stunts, but, then again that is Hollywood. It is always about what will wow the mass audience instead of what is the truth based on common sense and dignity.Because of all the nonsense in this movie, I gave it a rating of 3.",The Perfect Storm

326,Mariano_Anderson,This movie was great movie in many meanings.,8,18 September 2008,"I'd read the book and then saw the poster for the movie, so I was excited about seeing THE PERFECT STORM. But I did wonder how the filmmakers were going to translate the story to the screen. Studio pictures have to have ""star parts"" to attract names like George Clooney--but the problem with THE PERFECT STORM was that, by choosing to tell the story through the fishermen on the Andrea Gale, the script would have to create their story: no one knows what happened to them. The book describes them as they head out to sea...and they literally disappear into the storm. No one survived. No one will ever know what happened. (And you learn this in the very first paragraph of the book). So, basically, you're seeing made-up scenes of in-fighting and struggles culled from other fishing stories. That bothered me when I first saw the film, because the bickering and scuffling between the Andrea Gale crew felt forced and unreal. Read the book. It's filled with fascinating facts and true stories of danger and heroism. The movie is...well, a movie.",The Perfect Storm
327,PugsMom,Very Lame,4,24 November 2000,"**SPOILER ALERT** (I gave this film a 4 out of 10 mainly because of the coast guard sub-plot) I saw this movie on video at a friend's house and I'm really glad I didn't pay one penny to see it. Cliché is the first word that comes mind when I think about describing this lame film. Actually, ""cliché"" in an understatement. The movie was so poorly written that even the most dramatic lines were comical and had me laughing out loud. George Clooney (who I think is a terrible actor anyway  because he always acts the same in all of his films) plays a self-centered fishing boat captain who has to prove to himself that he hasn't ""lost it"" by sailing his crew (a bunch of immature men) into the middle of three hurricanes (""The Perfect Storm"" according to the local TV meteorologist) in order to catch a lot of fish. The fact that he doesn't realize what he's sailing into is astounding to me. And the fact the he doesn't turn around and head home because he has to make the catch of his lifetime while endangering the lives of his crew is repulsive. His only saving grace (if you can call it ""saving"") was that he ""went down with the ship"" instead of surfacing with Mark Wahlberg (not that he would have lived anyway if he did surface.) Maybe I missed something but how could he NOT turn around. At one point they all take a vote as to whether or not they should sail on and all of the men agree that they should because if they don't the fish will spoil. This is after the scene where all of the crew wanted to head home because they had a bad feeling about the journey. Anything to make a buck , I guess. What's up with that????OK...now to the special effects. A lot of people have posted about how incredible they were. And some of them were indeed great. But my problem was I knew they were ""effects"" as there is no way to re-create that kind of environment. Knowing this, I couldn't get past the fact that the storm was entirely computer generated and for some reason that ruined the ""specialness"" of it it all. I know...call me a cynic!! The final wave that did them in was tremendous, but I found it hard to believe that the ship withstood as much as it did without sinking or capsizing  many scenes earlier. But hey, I'm not sailor. I also wondered why no one on the boat EVER wore a life jacket. I mean COME ON. I would have strapped one on immediately. Didn't they have any on board??I liked the sub plot involving the coast guard rescuers. That to me was the best part of the movie. I'd say it's definitely worth watching if it comes on HBO, but don't pay for it. Wait for the freebie.",The Perfect Storm

And there is also the main problem of the movie: tons of water, and not really a hell of a story. George Clooney desperately tries to save the movie, but the utterly uninspired direction of W.

The Storm itself blew me away, the special effects were awesome.  I spent every second wishing that the guys survive this one bout of the storm.  They never lose hope and as a result, neither did I. The final scenes are amazing and emotional, and it rocks me even more to know that this really happened, men really had to go through this and their families had to deal with everything as well.

Two people destroyed this film, Wolfgang Petersson and James Horner.  The direction is laughable, this film could not possibly squeeze another sub-plot into the storm.  Completely irrelevant events happen constantly.  To add insult to the dull pain all scenes of tension involve at least three cutaways.  Essentially once you actually begin to care if the characters live or die the film cuts to an entirely new set.  The subpolt lasts just long enough to stop caring for the original characters then it cuts back again.  To make matters worse James Horners irritating score does not let up for one second.  The power of the storm and human emotion is trivialized by those incessant violins.

The acting was good (even with Mark Wahlberg's funky bunch accent) and the visual effects were very well done. The problem? It didn't seem to have much substance. I may have gotten into it more if I were a regular boater or fisherman myself, but I am not, and frankly, I was a little bored.

Is it that George Clooney swings around on a ship like Tarzan in a film which is supposed to be a memorial to those who died on that fateful day (as was the book's intent)? Could it be that Michael Ironsides portrays a villain (as if the film needed one) which could have been as justly shown donning an eye patch, peg-leg, parrot, rum bottle, and saying the words argh repeatedly?  I don't know... but certainly this film has very little positive to offer until the very moment that the ship sinks and these horrible characters die.

Therefore, it´s perhaps only one possible interpretation of what went on during the storm.

339,porcupinewebb,One of the only films to leave me crying. I could only watch this film once.,8,24 November 2006,"One of the only films to leave me crying, not for the great acting, the shooting or anything else but just the story and how it relates to my past life. Not long after leaving school I went to work on a long line boat catching cod. A few weeks after starting went out with a young skipper and we got caught in some awful weather that resulted in the loss of the boat, it was breaking up on the shingle. Whilst we were pretty sure of our position in general we were not sure if we were breaking up on the beach or the sand bar a few hundred metres off-shore. We had no choice, the boat was disintegrating around us, we had to leave the boat. Visibility was less than twenty metres. Taking that step out of the boat, knowing that if this was the sand bar and not the beach we would be dead in minutes, well you just can not explain what it feels like. Seeing this film brought back such memories as I have tried to forget and is the reason I have only seen this film the once although I do have a still shrink-wrapped copy on DVD and hope to watch it again one day.The line, ""this is going to be hard on my little boy"" as one of the crew accepts his fate is just so , how it was. No panic, no hysterics, just resignation after working to try and make things come to together. That is just how I felt when I stepped of the wreck boat and in the direction the waves were breaking. After a few metres we knew we were on the beach.Wolfgang Petterson does a great job of capturing everything that the life of a long-line fisherman is about. I can not comment on how factually accurate the story is to the real events of the real Andrea Gail but I will personally vouch for the feelings and emotions this film conveys.As for me, I was rescued form the beach along with my skipper by the coastguard and after a night in hospital being treated for exposure was back working on a different boat in less than a week.",The Perfect Storm

The script and the direction take far too many liberties with the book, inventing a character here and there, combining this story detail with another, and  developing several key characters as total cliches.  I am even willing to give them the poetic license of speculating as to what might have happened onboard the Andrea Gail before and during the storm.  However, it was a real letdown to see so many cliched plot devices thrown into already solid story.  The Coast Guard and Air Force rescue sequences, about which Sebastian Junger goes into great detail in the book, were sort of an afterthought in the movie and unfortunately become contrived and largely fictional.The script aside, the movie is actually sort of boring and the performances pretty rote, with the actors spouting a seemingly endless string of old mariner soliloquies.

Some of the back story in this movie was pretty cheesy.The movie picks up once the storm rolls in, but the weather guy at the TV station in Boston commenting on the meteorology to bring you along was pretty cheesy, too.Everyone has a pretty good idea how this ends up, but I'll try not to spoil it.  There is a pretty good side story with a Coast Guard ship and an Air Force Reserve helicopter.  The movie condenses down a couple of stories from the book, and takes some other liberties that have made other viewers skeptical about this plot.  Yes, the Air Force helicopter really went out on a rescue in the storm, and it did in-flight refueling, although the helicopter's mission didn't have to do with the Andrea Gail.  The rest of the helicopter's story is pretty much portrayed correctly.Usually when I've seen a fair to good movie based on the book, I'll find that the book is definitely worth reading, and that was the case here.

Action movies aren't supposed to be boring, but this one put me to sleep. I would give this a 2 or 3 out of 10 but as usual there are people who will rate any action movie high no matter how bad it is so therefore I rate this a 1 (awful).",The Perfect Storm

Having read the book and seen the movie a few years back, it seemed to grab me again this time. And not for the original reasons.This viewing almost came as a surprise-a prophecy.Consider the characters...mostly a gathering of desperate people doomed to their eventual demise because of the real life pathos for money. Some just need to stay ahead of the creditors. Some need to stay abreast of somebody's vile opinion of them (i.e. George Clooney). Others might just seem caught up in the need to succeed...despite apparent warnings.The storms themselves are a backdrop to a sinister mega plot of an unseen entity (or Deity). What we have here is the prescription for self destruction which drive so many of us to make toxic choices in our personal lives. And all such choices usually result in ""battle damage"" to so many we encounter in our all too brief stay on this planet.The world as were view it today is a brewing storm and it will consume those who chose unwisely. This especially includes those in position of authority ( political, judicial, legislative and clergy) to list but a few. Not to heed warnings and NOT to respect the very planet that was given to us eons past is a major blunder...and many will be caught up in this other ""PERFECT STORM"".",The Perfect Storm

What's more, I don't see the reason why. The movie is more about the storm than the characters, yet the focus is on the characters. If they had died with a purpose, a reason, it might have been worth my while. That didn't happen though. A great movie with a horrible ending, which is sad because the ending makes the rest of the movie pointless.",The Perfect Storm
354,Mr. Moviegame,Impressive sea action film,8,8 February 2001,"For its genre, this is quite an impressive film. Contrary to the silly remarks by other reviewers, this movie offers realistically developed characters, outstanding special effects, and enough suspense at the end to keep you wondering (assuming you haven't read the book). All of the actors are perfect for their roles. Not only do they relate to real-life working people, but the portray them with dignity and nobility. Most of the negative reviewers probably never lifted anything heavier than a phone book, and don't know the meaning of sweat, blood and real work. As for comments about stupid actions of the captain, let me ask some of these people: have you ever driven in a snowstorm to get home? Certainly, so why denigrate the captain here? This is not the kind of movie for actors like Ralph Fiennes or Hugh Grant. This is the niche of George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The two female leads (Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are also outstanding. I am glad they did not cast Michelle Pfeiffer or some overly pretty actress in these roles. About the only quibble I have with the film are the fishes. The shark looks suspiciously like the one in Deep Blue Sea. When he bites Mark, the foot should have come off. The jaw strength of a shark is incredibly powerful, and its action is very swift. The animatronic swordfish had too much sheen and didn't twist erratically enough.

Even the special effects were pretty obvious (watch the Coast Guard helicopter as it does a perfect 180 degree turn on a dime, in the middle of the storm, to land on the boat deck!?!?).I couldn't figure out why I was getting so annoyed with this film. At about 15 minutes from the end, I realized the whining background music had been playing almost constantly since the beginning of the film.

As half hour by half hour rushes by, another anorak (you don't even see their faces) gets washed overboard, you get drowned in them as much as the fishers of the Andrea Gail get drowned in the Atlantic. It turned out to be the cliché Hollywood movie: 15 minutes of introduction of something of a plot (every character gets roughly 1.5 minutes for some personality and to kiss his girl friend goodbye), then hand the camera over to the special effects guy and forget about character development, plot development. Just to season it with a little love, a little future perspectives to get washed away, some on-board rivalry and some ""old man and the sea"" - cliché simply didn't do it for me. 2 out of 10 (and those points only for the 10,000 fishermen of Gloucester, who lost their lives since 1623 at sea)",The Perfect Storm

The actors roles are supposed to reflect a small New England coastal town, although I think some people might be offended by how simplistic the characters are made. The hardship of making ends meet in the fishing industry is well-portrayed. What really makes the movie is the special effects.

All the stuff about friction between the crew and the captain was not true to the book and the interviews of those that knew the captain and crew. They made the crew out to be greedy and the greed led to the decisions that lost the boat - not so. You can't turn and run from a storm and nobody that has rolled a boat cheers like kids and laughs about it while they are still in the storm.

This movie struck a balance between the development of real life characters and the journey out into an almost unbelievable storm.  Too much focus on either aspect of the story would have diminished the whole. Too much focus on special effects would have made the film fake . Any more character development and the story would have become ultra boring. Instead , the characters were established enough to evoke sympathy and eventually grief.  That is not easy to pull off in an action flick.  The scenes of the storm were extraordinary and unforgettable. Spoiler:    seeing  Bobby floating alone and alive on those somewhat large waves will remain a haunting image. More so since i thought he was going to be the lone survivor. It was nice to not know the ending of the story before going to see it. This is not in the league of the tale of that big oceanliner ... you know the one.

Then the movie started and my expectations faded, and then crashed.  The film is brimming over with cheesy cliches and outrageous situations.  The acting is decent but the overall motivation of the characters is ridiculous and incomprehensible.  Maybe the characters are too down to earth to be interesting I dunno, but it makes for bad movie making anyhow.  Also, the SFX seemed ridiculous.  CG will be the downfall of great movies.

I had to laugh at the part where the captain had to torch cut the stabilizing anchor, pretty outlandish stuff. That's the problem with movies based on true stories. We don't know what happened out there to these people and it's a sad story, but adding outlandish dramatizations? does it work or take-away from it? This is the problem with the 1.5-2 hour movie time-frame, not very substantive, cheap and fast.... I especially had to laugh at the part where the captain finally declares that it's time to turn around...really? And I can't help wondering why they didn't divert to Newfoundland and wait the storm out? A little to late don't you think? If they had any notions that there was a hurricane brewing or, as the film implied, a broken ice machine where they had to get back or lose their catch, they could have gone to Newfoundland to make some other arrangements.

No sorry, that is NOT how the real ocean looks in a roaring storm, groups of people swimming around, kind of ""socializing"" in the water throughout the second half of the film.Maybe the water-spray is OK, but the magnitude and force of the waves just look like what the are, a simple studio trick, and does not come across well at all.Which brings me to the most stupid thing, that is happening over and over in the film, is when somebody goes overboard in danger, is that other crew immediately jumps in there too, to ""help"" him. You do that in real life, and you all face certain death. The ONLY chance you have to help somebody gone overboard in bad weather is FROM your ship, with proper gear and training. IN the water you are completely powerless, immediately lost and totally exhausted.And visibility from a small ship in a storm (esp. in the dark!) is practically zero, which also makes many of the scenes very unrealistic.(WARNING: spoiler ahead!)As to ""based on a true story"", well, when that story is about a group of people who disappeared under unknown course of events, the film-maker can of course dream up anything they wish. well, that's obviously what they did here.",The Perfect Storm

There were other parts that brought the film down, especially the U.S. Coast Guard sub-plot and this search for Jones (whoever he was).

I mean, The Perfect Storm, Peterson gives us the stench, claustrophobia, boredom, and terror of a fishing boat somewhere on a sound stage that's supposed to be the northern Atlantic.  What's missing are any real characters to care about.  A collection of men with lame back stories find themselves in contrived situations, performing utterly incredulous feats of derring-do while we wait for them to die.  George Clooney manages to climb a 30 to 40 foot metal scaffold one handed, holding a blow torch in the other, while riding 50 foot waves in 100 plus mile an hour winds.  Reaching the top, the scaffold drops back to the deck, dangling Clooney over the side of the boat, yet he manages to hang on to both it and his blow torch.  Holy Incredulity, Batman!

I'm a lover of action movies, but this one had so much, that I just got bored. For about a halfhour of this movie there is a continuous action sequence that goes something like this. Ship goes up big wave, ship goes down big wave, ships hits next waves breaks lines, men try and fix lines, man gets knocked off, man gets picked up, go up and down more big waves, people get wet, and then the ending. I paid attention for a little while, but soon all the stuff going on the ship just looked the same to me.

So I came into this movie not knowing what to expect for the crew of the Andrea Gail and the coast guard rescue folks. Imagine going to see Titanic not knowing the ship hits an iceberg and sinks at the end. Same deal.Anyway, The Perfect Storm started out a little slow but when the storm hit, things got intense and exciting. George Clooney played a very believable and stressed out Capt. Billy Tyne. Tyne was under some major pressure to produce some fish. He and his crew needed to make some money so they went WAY out and get caught in one of the weirdest and worst storm combinations in the history of meterology. The special effects during the storm were tremendous. The photography was tense and exciting as the crew of the Andrea Gail fight for their lives. Mark Walhberg's ""Bobby Shatford"" was a very likable character. Walhberg is really beggining to become a really good actor as he played Shatford with such feeling, it was almost too sad to see what happend to the character at the end.===READERS SPOILER ALERT===> And that's really why I rated the Perfect Storm a 7 instead of a 10. You spend the whole movie getting attatched to these characters, rooting for them to survive only to see ALL of them, not just one, not most, but ALL of them die. To those who remember the story of the Andrea Gail in 91, this is not a surprise. But for me, as a person who did not recall the story, it was a shocking finish. The tearful end to Mark Wahlberg's character was just the end of a bad series of events. It was truly a major letdown. The ending scene of the funeral with all the loveones weeping about the deaths of the crew was just gutwrenching. As we left the theater, there was not one happy, smiling face in the crowd. Every one was miserable because of the feelings the movie pulls out of you. ===END SPOILERS==> Despite the ending, this movie was a cinematic feat on par with the thrilling Twister. It was tense, exciting, and fun.While, for the reasons stated above, I didn't give the film a ""perfect score"", the Perfect Storm is definitely a movie I'd recommend to see.",The Perfect Storm

Basically, a ship crew goes out on a journey to snag fish and get caught up in the wrath of the sea.  Pretty hallow script, but that's what it is.  And though there are a few impressive effects, even computer magic cannot not make up for this bad movie.

When watching news on TV, the most interest goes to the reports on crashes and nature disasters, especially those causing mass death. Isn't it because it's the manifestation of our subordination to the untamed elementals? Isn't it what makes us see that all this high-tech world and all our intelligence are still far from providing absolute safety for the mankind? So, the catastrophe movies were, are and I think will remain attractive in the nearest future.As for the movie itself, it's difference from the many other movies of the kind (nature catastrophes) is that it's based on the true story. Moreover, the hazard of being caught in a storm is a part of a fisherman's job and life. That's what makes this movie really believable. The special effects, to my opinion, are not 100% perfect, but then again, where they are? Yet, what could be imagined about the combination of wind, rain, ocean, and a ship, - it was. At certain scenes it seems the imagination of the creators is going beyond the reality, but no one could prove they're right or wrong.

In some sense this movie is a play to overturn all the Hollywood cliches - in all but all it's aspects and plot-lines. You'll find here all the merits of W.P. excellent cine-art: a exciting and very artistic gallery of faces (and human types farther), an overwhelming and enchanting presence of the Nature - namely sea, very moving and cutting music...

Having enjoyed Wolfgang Petersen's work on ""Das Boot"" and ""Air Force One"", I was very disappointed at ""The Perfect Storm""s inability to make me care about the characters. Clooney and Wahlberg put in solid performances, but Diane Lane is grating as Wahlberg's salty (and wanna-be sultry) love interest.  One is left with the impression she's trying to focus more on her forced Massachusetts-coast accent than her performance, and the makers even try to make her boyfriend's black-eye a symbol of caring rather than domestic violence.  The first two-thirds of this movie resembles a hackneyed soap-opera, and when the storm finally hits its peak, you're well worn from two other storylines worked in involving a yacht and a helicopter crew (where nothing goes right the first time, just so we know we're being held in suspense).  Visually spectacular, but just like the 1996 movie ""Twister"", the great effects are compromised by predictable, overworked, and distracting characterizations that may actually have you checking your watch and doing repeat visits to the popcorn stand.

We are not shown real people, we are *told* what to think. Then we are taken to sea, where we are introduced to some random other characters (in a sailboat, and a helicopter) who are also in trouble.  But who cares? I don't care about the main characters, much less these completely random unknowns.  The special effects are decent, but even in the storm the writing and acting are wretched.  The sailors are stupid and incompetent, and even though they are continually on the edge of death, they have little cheering/bonding sessions every time they fish one another out of the drink. The ending of the movie is embarassingly maudlin, pumping (and pumping, and pumping) for tears after cheating us of any real human beings to care about.To top it off, the musical score is intrusive and, like the rest of the flick, ham-handed and manipulative.  Strings swell every time somebody so much as twitches, until the audience is numb.I was insulted by this movie, and I'm insulted that audiences no longer have the capacity to be outraged when they are pandered to and their intelligence is repeatedly insulted.

385,jdimstr31,An INCREDIBLE Ride!!!!,10,1 July 2000,"This is, without question, one of the greatest action films ever made. There has never been anything like it. The visuals are so outstanding, that you feel transported out of the theater and into the storm itself. When you stand up after the film, your legs feel wobbly, and you feel you have to adjust to solid ground again. The plot is fairly simple, six down on their luck fisherman, set out to make one more attempt at a big haul. As they head for home, they run right into the most powerful storm the world has ever seen. That's it. That's all you need to know. Ive hear a lot of people complaining about lack of character development. Let me ask you something. What was it that got you to see this movie. What was the hook that made you say ""I've got to see that movie!"" Was it the possibility of seeing complex characters, or intricate storylines? Hell NO! It was the shot of a 50 foot fishing boat heading straight up a mile high tidal wave!!! So since the focus of the movie is on that very type of thing, where's the problem. Think about this, there is no need for the characters to be deep. They were fisherman, they are very simple, normal people. You meet them and the people they love. You learn their reasoning for doing this very dangerous job. You learn why they venture into the storm. You care about what happens to them. What more do you need? there's actually two stories at work there. One being the fishermen, the other involving the crew of an Army rescue helicopter, and the perils they face during the storm. Both are cut together very well. As for the main cast, George Clooney is excellent, Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a lot to do, but what he does, he does well, John Reilly is great as Murph, and Diane Lane provides the perfect center of anquish for all those left at home to worry. (She's a babe too. Does the woman ever age? She's gorgeous!). The real star here is the storm itself. Industrial Light and Magic have really outdone themselves here. The turbulent sea is one of the most striking visuals I have ever seen in a movie. It looks completely real, and is blended perfectly with the live actors. I can't even put its magnificence into words. It has to be seen to be believed. The story of the men of the Andrea Gail is heroic and, ultimately, tragic. It is brought vividly to the screen in a film that is viscerally exciting, and emotionally powerful at the same time. I can't rate it high enough. 10 out of 10!!!!",The Perfect Storm

A predictable ending is also included if you watch the news or can just make a bold prediction. While this movie isn't completely bad and there are some good aspects to it, the film in general is really disappointing. I give it **1/2 stars out of **** stars.",The Perfect Storm

The character development was extremely obvious. I mean you know the outcome of the film and it all seems a bit unnecessary.  Its like okay the girlfriend, mother, and the kid will all be sad because of their lose. If I hadnt heard anything about the story I would have known who was going to die by the way they portayed the characters in the beginning. The little boy, though cute, was a horrible addition if you ask me; terrible acting.  I almost fell asleep on the beginning, almost wanted to leave.  Then they got to the ocean and it got exciting.  The rest of the movie kept me biting my nails.  The antisipation factor was great!  Would I recommend it yes, but you may want to come about 20 min after it starts.",The Perfect Storm

391,cyoti,"""Storm"" of the century",8,29 October 2002,"*** WARNING*** MOVIES ARE NOT LIKE THE BOOK. MOVIES ARE RARELY EVER LIKE THE BOOK. MOVIES ARE ROUGHLY TWO HOUR VISUAL INTERPRETATIONS OF SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK. BOOKS ARE STORIES THAT UNRAVEL AT EITHER THE READER'S DISCRETION OR IMAGINATION.That being said and done. It still floors me that people expect movies to be anywhere near as in depth or intricate as the book. I can't tell you how many people walked out of The Perfect Storm saying `The book was better, the book was better.' No kidding. I loved The Perfect Storm, the movie was so entertaining. The story, the characters, the special effects were all top-notch. I was not bored for a second. This is the type of movie that once it gets going, there's no stopping it. Those of you expecting Twister at sea, you're gonna be disappointed, this one actually has a story.
As the poster pretty much states, in the fall of 1991 off the coasts of Maine, the fishing vessel, Andrea Gail, encounters a storm that had never occurred in recorded history. I myself am from New Jersey(no wiseass comments either, I can hear them already) and was living there at the time this occurred. I have no recollection of this storm, whatsoever. Anyway, I just found my self amazed by the scope and magnitude of this storm, as it was portrayed in the film. Wolfgang Peterson(In the Line of Fire) handles the story and the impressive ensemble cast with style and grace. From my understanding, the novel(which I have never read) deals with the storm as an overall synopsis of the people involved. The movie takes a different approach, the movie revolves mainly around the six fisherman aboard the swordfish boat Andrea Gail.The ragtag crew consists of Capt. Billy Tyne(Clooney Three Kings, Out of Sight), rookie fisherman Bobby(Walhberg Boogie Nights, Three KIngs), career salty dog, Murph(John C. Reilly Boogie Nights, Magnolia) Jamaican Cassanova, Alfred-Pierre(Allen Payne New Jack City, Jason's Lyric), mousy Cassonova-wannabe, Bugsy(John Hawkes)plus last minute replacement, Sully(William Fitchner Go, Contact) Try say that three times fast.As the movie starts the Andrea Gail has had a run of bad luck with the fish. The characters are given their respective, although somewhat typical, set-ups and backgrounds. Capt. Tyne's looking for the big haul while flirting with rival captain played by Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio(Scarface, The Abyss). Bobby just trying to get enough money for his divorce lawyer, so he can marry his new girl played by Diane Lane(Murder at 1600, My Dog Skip). Murph is looking to spend more time with his kid and so on and so on. So before the end of the season, Capt. Tyne decides to give it one more shot. That's pretty much the set-up of the movie. The vast majority of you will not be let down by this movie, which will definitely keep me off of any fishing boats this hurricane season.",The Perfect Storm
392,lukerazor,Perfectly Awful,1,24 January 2003,"This has got to be one of the worst strung together films I have ever scene. With some characters given a trite and overlong ""background"" and others just appearing halfway through the movie is just the start.Spoiler??This film is ""based on a true story"" but given that the truth is that there was a Really big storm and a fishing boat didn't come back its not really much to go on, plot wise.The score achieves one thing that surprised me.

The fisherman's life is a hard life...yeah so whatever. The buggers had enough fish they should have gone home a lot sooner. Beyond that everything that could possibly done to pull on the old heart strings was done in this movie and the result was a big stinking pile of trite crap. The music dictates every emotion. Was the director unable to get his point across with hammering it home endlessly with an overdone soundtrack? The last 40 minutes or so (it felt like a bloody eternity) was quick cuts, no more then a few seconds each of water and waves and boats and people and things. What the hell was going on here? Yeah yeah...it was a turbulent sea. We could have figured that out in a lot less time then 40 minutes. I can't go without mentioning the scene with George Cloney going down with the ship...yeah right!!!!!! I would have been a lot happier to have seen the director, sound editor and screen writer at the bottom of the deep blue sea. Thirty pounds or so of wasted hackneyed acetate. Highly not recommended.",The Perfect Storm
394,jimbuckusa,Attack of the giant waves,3,7 July 2000,"After 20 minutes of James Horner's score, I became so annoyed of the repetitive theme that I started praying that Celine Dionne would suddenly break into song.  This music never let up!  I recall the great chase scene in the movie, Bullitt:  Lalo Schiffrin's score built up the suspense magnificently until the chase actually started, then the music stopped and the excitement of the chase was enough to carry the scene.We are asked to believe all the bravado that this crew allegedly demonstrated during such a terrifying storm.  Phooey! These guys probably had water running down their legs (and I don't mean rain) as soon as they realized they were in a hurricane.  Climbing up the rigging with a torch to cut the chain of the sea anchor...?  Yeah, sure. And, of course, that sailor who jumped in the ocean during a gale to rescue the idiot who got hooked by his fishing line was really pushing credulity.  These guys probably all died of hypothermia long before the 100 foot waves hit them, and then the boat simply capsized without a crew to guide her.   If you buy this movie as a true story, then your needle is stuck in the same groove as Horner's score.",The Perfect Storm

I finally saw it opening day, yesterday, and I was more than pleased. The effects really scared me. I love watching movies taking place on the ocean like that, because I'm so afraid of water: lakes, rivers, oceans, etc. I couldn't believe the special effects, and the story line. My mother and I went into the movie thinking we knew one person who wouldn't make it home from the ship. *SPOILERS AHEAD* *SPOILERS AHEAD* *DO NOT PROCEED TO READ UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SEE THE END* We had seen on Entertainment Tonight that Chris' boyfriend dies, well I knew Chris was Diane Lane, and Mark Wahlberg was her boyfriend, so we figured ""dammit Marky Mark dies"". We were extremely in shock when every single guy on the ship went down with it, except Mark, who was drowned by the waves. I guess people who might remember the story of the ship back in 1991 would know everyone died, but I was only 9 so I wouldn't remember.*SPOILER ENDED* The movie was good no matter what, though.

399,albatros-5,Almost a perfect film...,9,2 July 2000,"Although like a few other reviewers here, I got a little sick of some of the ultra-sweet love scenes between Diane Lane and Mark Wahlberg.  The book was never that cheesy in describing their relationship.  Other than that, I thought this film was flawless.  I had just finished reading the book beforehand, and was amazed at how closely it followed the events.  People complaining about character development obviously haven't read the book.  In the book, there is no dialogue whatsoever between the crew of the Gail.  It's all told by others who were in the storm.  There were a few scenes where I would of been a little confused, had I not read the book, but my friends didn't seem to notice.  One scene that I won't soon forget is the final wave the Gail hits, with George Clooney yelling ""Come on!!! Come on!!"" right into it's face.  I had goosebumps when that scene hit, one of the most unforgettable scenes I've seen.  The one scene that I thought was pretty amusing was how in the helicopter rescue scene, somehow throughout the turbulent waves and high winds, the copter manages to stay on top of the ship throughout.  The ship would of been blown to kingdom come.  Other than that, it was much more realistic than I would of thought.9 out of 10.",The Perfect Storm

I was not sure how well Wolfgang Petersen would be able to convey the story on screen, let me tell you he did an awesome job transforming this story into reality.  They tried to be as authentic as possible to the point that some people felt like they were getting sea sick in the theatre.

The coast guard was truly heroic in this story and they are on a daily basis. My hat is off to those brave men and women. The movie also points out what we take for granted, getting that fresh seafood is a high stakes gamble in terrible working conditions. It takes a special breed of person to do that work.

409,OneGarbageman,Greatest Film i saw that summer,10,4 May 2001,"I remember reading this book a year ago, it was superb.  It will remain in my library as long as i have one.  I saw the movie a short while afterwards (i picked up the book when the shooting for the film was just ending).  I purposely refused to read the critic's reviews until i had seen it. Honestly, it was one of the most magnificent films i had seen in a theater. It had plenty of action and suspense, but held a sturdy plot, unlike most Willis or Stallone films currently.  It's previous existence in book form helped it I'm sure.  Clooney adopts a rugged look and sound that would make you think he'd never appear on a Teen magazine.  Mark Wahlberg is also an extraordinary actor in this film, it's good to see him go so far in just these past few years.  The volume jumps around a little (a personal pet-peeve of mine), but the sound effects and computer graphics on the waves are magnificent.  The only thing that bothered me was the constant jokes and ego-boosting coming from the group of teenagers near me.  I'm sure this will be fixed with any video or DVD version though :)  Afterwards, i did read the reviews, many were sub-par.  Often, the professional critics commented on the physics of the waves and visibility in weather conditions...  Please don't forget that this is a movie.

These storms are some of the strongest and most terrifying manifestations of nature's strength.  This is the True story of the men on one of those illfated boats, The Andrea Gail.   Directed by Wolfgang Peterson(Das Boot) , This movie brings to life the Terror of what it was like inside a Killer Storm.  Based on the book by Sebastian Junger the Movie stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane lane, and a host of character actors too many to name.  If you have ever been leery of going out on the open sea, this movie will not help.   It brings to mind a similar disaster known as the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald but that's another story.  The Terror is real, the fear is real, The Sea is brutal and this movie brings it right to you.  Fate sometimes plays tricks on us, and for the men of the Andrea Gail, it was a wopper, The movie also touches on other rescues in the same storm, all very compelling and heroric.

If you have read the book and know the stories there are a few minor differences but there always are, aren't there?

From the start with the rip-off ""dramatic"" score that we've heard a thousand times before, to making the ship captains into potential lovers needlessly these touchs reduce the story to Stormy XXVII. Better would have been to do as the book did, allow it to start slowly without beating people overs the head that ""this will be a blockbuster""; let the music, characters and waves build without telegraphing ""did you notice we spent $60M bucks on this."" Come on Wolfgang, you can do  so much better.",The Perfect Storm
428,mspica8902,The Perfect Storm by perfectly frightened film makers,5,5 July 2000,"A mixed bag.  Some of the acting was good - certainly better than ""Titanic"", but some made the eyes roll.  The storm effects were fantastic as advertised, but since they were so good, I have one question:  Why beat it to death with the symphony orchestra?  It seems ridiculous to imagine, but the makers of this film must have at some point looked at the great, rousing footage and said, ""It's not good enough.  Bring on the violins!""",The Perfect Storm
429,rshep-3,"No talking, Just cool wave scenes!",5,14 August 2000,"Let me begin that I gave this film a solid 5 on the 10 point IMDB scale. That is, 5 for special effects, and 0 for screenplay. It has been a long time since I have watched a film with such bad, cheesy dialogue. While the special effects of the storm were unbelievable, the acting was terrible (especially Diane Lane who I usually love), the character relationships were so thinly portrayed and disgustingly sweet (note the scene between Diane Lane and Wahlberg's character's mom) that I nearly could not watch and truly did not care who died and who didn't. I truly can not understand why anyone likes this film. Take out the 30 minutes of cool effects and you have absolutely nothing left to enjoy.",The Perfect Storm

The characters weren't developed, and George Clooney's character was especially hard to relate to.  If you like action films, then this is one to see.  However, if you're looking for a movie with easy to relate to characters, this isn't it.  Although this movie does give you new respect for fishermen!",The Perfect Storm
431,SOY,A Worthwhile Tribute,9,11 July 2000,"After reading the book, I expected somewhat of a decline in enjoyment of the movie.  It seems every time I see a movie of a book I've read, I've been a little disappointed.  But not here.  This movie was enjoyable from beginning to end, not straying far from the story the book told.  The special effects were amazing and really provided the viewer with a slice of what life was like being a fisherman in the upper New England area of our country.  Plus, I appreciated the tribute it gave to our U.S. Coast Guard...a service far to many of us take for granted.  Cloony gave a wonderful performance, as did Marky Mark which really kept this picture together.  Because this movie is all based on facts too, it made it that much more significant and entertaining.  Further, the sound was remarkable, at least in my theater. I definitely recommend viewing this movie.  If for anything else, it makes for a wonderful tribute to these brave souls who work so hard for so little to put a little money on their table.",The Perfect Storm

I expected brilliant and seamless computer graphics, they were delivered. I expected a fairly personal story about the people involved, that was delivered. I expected some amazing sounds and sights, and I got them.While I was watching this film, I couldn't help being aware of the fact that the people being tossed around the sea were, at least in part, real and that this movie was based on what they went through. But I also got more... I got to be in the storm and feel my heart quicken a little as the fishing vessel edges up impossibly large waves, and then crashes down to face another.It is not a pretty film, it portrays very well the harsh environment in which it is set. It is a 'real' film, that doesn't seem to pull any punches.The photography is excellent and really draws you in, it is fluid and makes you feel close to the action. The acting is very good, it really connects you with the crew of the Andrea Gail and those around them. The computer animation is what you would expect it to be - almost seamless - it delivers huge waves and powerful storm cells.This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and truly removes you from your reality and into the storm.",The Perfect Storm

I agree, that the stories of the original sailors weren't all that creative, but they existed to establish the desperation and how hard it is to make a living as a fisherman.  Without this background, the audience might not believe why Clooney decides to try and drive right through the storm.

It saddens me that this story (which IS a true story, by the way) would be made less valuable because there weren't better special effects, because the ""science"" wasn't correct enough, or because of some other technical issue.These people lived this horror and they had wives and girlfriends and children and parents.Fishermen work hard to feed us and their work is under-appreciated.Let's hope that if ever a movie is made about Hurricane Katrina, its success won't be based on computer-aided graphics, but rather on capturing the spirit of its victims.",The Perfect Storm

The book was well-researched and perfectly crafted.   I live in Massachusetts so I vividly remember the storm and the tv coverage of the search for the Andrea Gail.   The movie could have been so good, but it made me angrier than any movie I've ever seen.  It was horrible, almost from the opening credits.  Everyone mangled some pathetic semblance of a Gloucester accent, except George Clooney, who didn't even bother to attempt one.  The directing was ham-handed. The acting was wooden and one-dimensional from everyone involved.  The music was laughably overblown.  Even the hi-tech wizardry was utterly wasted, as it depicted impossible scenes like Captain Billy Tyne being thrown around from an outrigger and surviving.  Seb didn't even contemplate that happening because the idea of it was ludicrous.  No fisherman on earth would try that maneuver in any storm, ever.   There is no reason anyone should see this movie, period.

Not much thought has been given to character development either, so  - in spite of fine acting performances by the entire cast  - the whole thing comes across a bit shallow. Some of the dialogues, especially towards the end, are utterly unbelievable.

The script is very contrived and cheesy....especially (SPOILERS) how the women are portrayed as woryying so much about the men and the outcome of the movie is obvious right from the beginning.  Diane LAne is a wonderful actress but I felt bad that all she had to work with was a script where she had to tell MArk Whalberg how much she loved him! The men did pretty good jobs....but they also did not have a lot to work with....all they had to do was say how much they wanted to catch some fish and be at sea.  It was way too banal and boring. I was actually fidgeting in my seat and it was not that long of a movie!!! I also thought the storm scenes were fake looking and that the director could have cut some of the final storm scenes out of the movie.I really wanted to like this movie because I love the people in the cast but I just can't bring myself to like such a poorly wriiten story....I know that it is based on a true story....and I saw the real story on the Discovery channel and that was better than this movie!!

459,Lycos-2,"An enjoyable film, but not a great film",6,2 August 2000,"I went into this film with no expectations, and knowing little to nothing about the events on which it was based.  This helped me to enjoy it more, but that still didn't save this film.I came out of the cinema wondering how the film had managed to fill up over two hours.  By the end, we had no real feeling for the characters, and in fact one or two scenes made this so obvious to the viewer that one was jarred out of the suspension of disbelief required when watching films.SPOILERS BELOW - PLEASE READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS FILMThe scene which brought this home the most was the funeral - one of the attendees shown was a woman whom one of the supporting characters had met only twice, and then rather briefly, yet she was presented as a mourner of equal import as the wives and mothers of the other men lost.  She brought her children with her, who looked suitably grief-stricken, yet these children had never met the man for whom they mourned.Another example of lack of character development was the female captain - her character could have been developed so much more, but she was left as a distraction.  And what of the other crew members - why did two of them constantly fall out?  It was barely explained, and some of the crew were no more than perfunctorily introduced.Similar problems concerned the sailing boat also lost in the storm - we were given no introduction whatsoever to these characters, nor to the lifeboatmen/coastguard who saved them, and who tried to reach the Adrienne Gale.Faced with such shallow characters, it was difficult if not impossible to identify them, and when they were beset by problems I found myself not caring very much.Having said that, I enjoyed the film.  The visual effects were very impressive, flawless in fact.  The pace was upped, although the events that took place were often confusing (who was it who was washed overboard at any given time?  They all looked the same in their smocks).  The plot was undemanding, which helped considering that the characters were all so blurred.In all, I enjoyed the film, but left feeling uninvolved and strangely unfulfilled.  It could have been so much better, with a little more direction.",The Perfect Storm
460,jdsbuck,The story is in the visuals.,8,1 July 2000,"I just got back from seeing this film, and while I agree with some reviews that the characters were underdeveloped, I have to say that I enjoyed it in spite of this.  This movie gave me several surprises, and I was quite impressed with the special effects.  In my view, the effects worked very well to further the story itself.For a disaster film, this was much better than ""Twister"".  It's a great example of a genre film that accomplishes what it sets out to do.",The Perfect Storm
461,bigunit94,A step above the typical July release (minor spoilers),9,8 July 2000,"So far in theatres this year I've seen Gladiator, Frequency (3 times), American Movie, and now the Perfect Storm. Frequency is my favorite but this is very close. A day before seeing ""Perfect Storm"" I had just finished reading Sebastian Jungers book. I found the book to be, well, 3.75 out of 4 stars lets say. A very good book. Then I got home and read countless comments and reviews of this film. I think I would have enjoyed the film even more if I hadnt. Not because it spoiled the movie, but every time I got to a part someone complained about I was thinking about their complaint and not 100% the film itself. The Film:  This film is never boring, and also the melodrama was just right. Also its plot is NOT subpar, it is very good actually; it follows the book fairly closely (much more so than most movies based in books). A lot of things that occurred on the ship in the film were based off of things in the book that happened not necessarily on that voyage but things that Longliners in general have faced that where described in the book. At the very least this movie is an excellent visual companion to the book. Even the fishing scenes where entertaining as it helped further Jungers descriptions. But I think it more than stands on its own as a film.The acting is solid, and the costuming is great. These guys looked the part. None of these guys showed any traces of hollywood glamour. I never complain about botched accents because that is not an issue with me. I can't say myself how close they where but it doesnt detract from the film regardless. The character development is effective; this isnt a character study of fisherman, its a depiction of the effects of a superstorm and the attempts of a few humans to live through it. Also there are quite a few to develop and unless you want a 3 1/2 hour movie this about as good as your going to get. Which is still more than adequate. I do agree that the TV weatherman was kinda cartoonish but he is on screen for maybe 2 minutes tops so it isnt a detraction at all. The subplots involving the rescuers were all very good, a few minor changes where made from the real facts in those (namely the timeline of actual events and the names) but none that detract from the film. The characters of the subplots werent really introduced, and if it wasnt for the fact that those parts where based on true fact and vital to the book I would say these parts were filler. But what exciting filler it would have been! These where very confused scenes (in a good way) which gave an excellant portrayal of the difficulties in off shore rescues, especially in a hurricane. And they where very faithful to the descriptions in the book.On the other hand the Andrea Gail's experience in the storm will never be fully known, so once again the filmakers used a lot of ideas from the book and depicted them in the film. I commend the film makers for not cooking up a bunch of stuff to have happen, choosing instead to use ideas presented in Jungers excellant book. The dialog has taken a few shots from critics but I think it was fairly good, not great but not bad. I think for this genre of film it is actually quite good in spots. A couple lines make sound kinda hokey but too often are taken out of context by critics. The conflict between Sully and Murph isnt adequatly explained, I recall it being explained in a line or two early on but I cant quite remember. I hear its because Sully had an affair with Murph's ex. This was created by the writers, in the book there was no ill will between Sully and Murph (in fact they even did the grocery shopping for the trip together), it was between Bugsy and Bobby if I recall correctly. Looking for great dialog in this film is stupid because that is not the purpose of this film at all. If you want great dialog wait for the fall when the movies are more geared toward dialog rather than adventure. As I said earlier the acting was solid. Much better than most action/adventure/disaster films (the god awful acting in Twister comes to mind). Clooney and Wahlberg were good, and the rest of the supporting cast (save Lane for a touch of overacting) was very good as well. The shot of Sully standing alone sobbing as the water flooded the hull was memorable. Peterson's Directing was very good, though a few more broad shots of the ocean with the Andrea Gail would have been nice, though I see he was going for a more close in style to help the audience feel the shock of the storm. I give this a 3.5 (out of 4) on its own as a movie and a 3.75 as a visual companion to the book. The storm scenes were top notch, and its ending was effective. Since it is well known before that these men die you brace yourself for it and in fact the impact is lessened, so it isnt fair to say that the film was ineffective at tugging at your emotions since the movie goer is already braced for it. It is still quite heartbreaking nonetheless. So really the only fault I can find with this film is the whole Sully vs. Murph thing. I have never seen a perfect movie and this was no exception. But this does a terrific job at what it intended to do, and it I highly recommend it, especially if you've read the book. A definite step above your typical July release.",The Perfect Storm
462,ux,Lots of Waves,7,5 August 2000,"I think that most people, like I do, feel that there's something creepy about the vastness of the ocean.  This movie really exploits the creepiness, and it's entertaining for that reason (or if you're into Mark Wahlberg). The effects are pretty mint.  What's weird is that after watching these huge waves for hours, the ridiculously big one at the end doesn't seem so unrealistic anymore.  The characters are pretty boring.  Watching all the swordfish made me hungry.",The Perfect Storm
463,rdietz,"Looks fantastic, but that's about it",6,20 June 2000,"Forget Wolfgang Petersen, George Clooney, and Mark Wahlberg, this film is all about John Seale.  Don't see this movie if you want character development.  Don't see it if you like Christopher McDonald (he is horrible as the weather man).  However, if you like Seale's cinematography, you should see it, because it is the only good thing in the film.In fact it is so good, that it makes the ridiculous screenplay bearable. The script has as many ups and downs as the waves in the Atlantic.  All the action looks great.  The sunrise, the ocean, even the scrubby town of Gloucester all looks great. Like many films these days, however, the film is about 45 minutes too long. Petersen diverts from the six fisherman that we have seen from the begining, and starts telling the tale of the Coast Guard.  No one cares about the coast guard. The film is overwhelming.  By the end, you are out of breath, but you realize that amongst all the painful dialogue, amongst the coast guard that no one cares about, amongst the huge waves at see, and the stupidity of the seamen, you are watching a beautiful film.

464,dac-8,Powerful stuff.,8,30 June 2000,"It was a choice between Gone in 60 seconds, and The Perfect Storm. Every review of Gi60S was bad, so we went to see the other choice.From the start, this was a film about real people.  It featured honest looking folk who weren't icons of beauty; fat people, old people, wrinkled people.  Unshaven with unkempt hair (and this was on shore, not out on the boat).  If only for this, it was worth the price of the ticket.The story starts off slow, you get to see what the Gloucester swordfisherman are about, how they make their money, how they spend their money; relationships both new, old and broken.  A feel for what is day to day life in that place and time.  The unfairness of business (the guy who owns the boat gets 50% cut of the entire catch, whilst sitting on shore ""counting his money"") and the fickle nature of the industry (don't catch fish, then you don't get paid).Wolfgang Peterson's direction is remarkable; I must stress, I'm not a technical viewer of films, I don't know much about ""direction"" what makes a film 'good'; the only other WP film I've seen was Das Boot, and it was a harrowing viewing experience.  In The Perfect Storm, things happen that feel real, and dangerous.  The incidents on the boat show the special insanity that people who live their life out at sea must face in extraordinary weather conditions.  Books try to convey the power and majesty of the oceans; this film SHOWED you what they meant by 30,40,50 and 100 foot waves.   It was visceral. The waves grabbed you and said 'I can snap you like a piece of straw', then proceeded to snap things left right and centre.The people in the bad situations were very much full-on in trouble; this was no wimpy ""oh help, gosh, I'm getting a bit wet"" flick; it was an advertisement for how you would feel if you were in a situation where your main thoughts would consist of ""I'M GOING TO DIE OUT HERE"".I liked the film.  It was a bit soppy at the end, but not too drawn out.  The warnings people made in other reviews, about the messy details of sword fishing (fish being gutted, packed in ice, etc.) are all too relevant;  All part of the reality this film is trying to depict -- best to put up with the few minutes of blood and guts and not dwell on the animal suffering that must be involved :-)There is a lot more I could say, but as with all film reviews, it is better not to explain things, but rather to indicate what you'll get out of it if you see it yourself.   Go see it.8 out of 10 for me.Dac",The Perfect Storm
465,manon-6,When the storm is the star....,4,1 July 2000,"When the storm is the star of the movie, it leaves you with enormous dissatisfaction, especially when you know the film cost $120 Mio. As a German I would love to compliment director Wolfgang Petersen, but he did not handle the story and characters sensitive enough to make one really get into it.Only the fact that these men on the boat existed and died in real life created sadness - the movie though left me cold. Mainly responsible for that was Petersen's biggest mistake : casting George Clooney as the lead. Clooney's character is cold closed, empty and seems to be always somewhere else. The movie showed that even when Clooney is surrounded by the charismatic Marc Wahlberg, he does not dazzle like a movie star. And this film reveals his lack of star charisma so brutally, because you do not get distracted by his pretty face but instead just have to focus on what comes out of him.",The Perfect Storm

Maudlin. Shallow. Tedious.I'd read (and loved) the book. I like Clooney. I like Wahlberg. I'd been looking forward to seeing this film for months. I really wanted it to be good. It wasn't.Scene after scene, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying ""Yeah. Sure."" Imagine George Clooney climbing out a 50-foot scaffolding that's swinging wildy in 100+mph wind, lit acetylene torch in hand while being buffeted by 100 foot waves and the crew have nothing better to do in the middle of this incredible hurricane than to watch and then cheer when he finally accomplishes the task at hand. ""Yeah. Sure."" There's a ""Jaws"" rip-off where the crew accidentally lands a shark who then lies amiably with Wahlberg's foot in his mouth while the crew wait for Clooney to get his shotgun so he can shoot Jaws in the head. How Wahlberg's foot comes out of the shark's mouth with nothing but a scratch(particularly after Clooney shoots it in the head with a shotgun)is yet another ""Yeah. Sure.""The special effects didn't do it for me either. While they were an improvement on the battle ship scene in ""Ben Hur"" I couldn't get beyond ""Hey! Cool computer animation!""The music is unrelenting ""elevator symphonia"" and it's slathered on in particularly heavy doses when you're supposed to have an emotional response to charcters you couldn't care less about.Don't waste your time.

469,perspectives,I can't believe George's acting is so bad,3,7 July 2000,"Like many ER fans, I've mostly believed that looking at George Clooney is enough to warrant the time spent in doing so.  The Perfect Storm changed my mind about that.  George, how could you?  Your beard was just a bit too scruffy to make enduring your flat delivery worth my time.That said about poor George, I feel bad.  Because really his acting was on par with the others in this film; plagued by wooden language and scant character development, this film is a disaster.  Audience members laughed aloud at several points in my screening.  Others were yawning, but silently.This film has two very interesting dimensions.  First, the characterization of the dangerous business of commercial fishing is both informative and rich in intrigue.  It turns out this really is hard work, and life and limb are at risk.  The way the story highlights the actual fishing excursion activities is really interesting.Second, the rescue missions are quite engaging.  The storm, as we all expected, was energizing, despite the fact that we knew it was generated by so many bits and bytes.  Nonetheless, those waves did look big.  The coast guard maneuvers were exciting, and the coast guard actors played by far the most realistic roles.Cutting half of the pre-storm footage would have helped this film immensely. Alternatively, trying some real character development with other than dead pan dribble for dialogue delivery would really have spiced things up.  As a third option, I suggest animated characters.  At least then we wouldn't have to feel sorry for the real people whose acting careers were set back a decade by what looked to me like the weakest aggregate set of acting in years.Shame on Petersen's The Perfect Storm.  Shame on the memory of Das Boot. The real lives of those lost at sea deserve a better memorial.perspectives",The Perfect Storm

471,james.steel,"An average disaster movie, saved by the special effects",6,30 July 2000,"The Perfect Storm is a disaster story of the ""man-versus-nature"" variety, and so will invariably be compared to Twister and Armageddon (although it claims to be ""Based on a True Story"" - words I always take with a pinch of salt!). If you are after some mindless rip-roaring excitement and entertainment, then The Perfect Storm will be a perfect film for you. The special effects really are awesome. I used to work at sea, and even I was feeling sea-sick in places. I guess most of the ocean scenes used CGI graphics, but it was very hard to tell - and moving water must be one of the hardest things to reproduce on computers.The first half of the film is quite slow, allowing some (but not much) character development - but then the excitement really takes off. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg put in good performances as the determined (and pressured) skipper and the rookie deck-hand. The plot doesn't really allow us to learn much about their characters (and less about the rest of the crew), but Clooney and Wahlberg do their best with what they have.I do have one BIG criticism of the film though. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was TOTALLY miscast as a fishing-boat skipper. She looked ridiculous to the point of absurd. I assume that her character was invented for politically-correct purposes (though correct me if I'm wrong - I haven't read the book!). I've never heard of a female trawler-skipper and, frankly, it seems as implausible as a female submarine captain! If one existed she wouldn't be anything like Mastrantonio - who appears the sort of girl for whom a broken finger nail would be a major crisis! I bet the writers were thinking ""Right, we need a token strong female character in this film who isn't just standing on the shore waiting for her man to return""! No doubt if Hollywood could persuade Wolfgang Petersen to remake Das Boot, they would demand a female character on the U-boat! My other criticism is that the film sometimes lurches into cliches and sentimentality. The final words of Mark Wahlberg were a good example of this and really made me cringe. ""There is only love"" ... yuk! yuk! yuk! yuk!Overall, this was a enjoyable popcorn-chewing disaster movie - I would say as good as Twister and superior to Armageddon. However, Wolfgang Petersen has made better films than this before - Das Boot and In the Line of Fire spring immediately to mind. This was just too ""Hollywood"".

Its inconceivable to me that these people on the boat didn't know what was going on. Did you see the size of that wall with dead people on the end that's like 5 people a year (and that was probably during normal weather season not super duper hurricane season) so they had to know there was a damn good reason for no one else out there trying to get the fish they were after.2) It turned out to be the top gun for the coast guard3) If I got thrown out of a boat into a horrible storm and all my shipmates (and the ship for that matter) where gone.

480,toriamiddleton,Very Interesting Flim,7,22 January 2020,"In the early 1990s a fishing boat named the Andrea Gail was caught in a storm. The town is in Gloucester, Massachusetts and, the Andrea Gail keep coming back with a poor catch. Desperate for money, the Captain named Billy Tyne begs his crew to go with him on a late season fishing catch. They go out farer than normal when, a big storm is right behind them. After much debating the crew decides to wait out the storm which is becoming into a hurricane. After repeated warnings from other ships, the Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing a fellow ship to call in a Mayday. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter responds, but then crashes.
The Andrea Gail endures many problems with 40-foot waves come crashing on to the deck. As a result, two men are thrown overboard. The crew decide to turn around to avoid further damage by the storm. But then, the vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. After attempting and failing to ride over the wave, the stricken fishing vessel capsizes and sinks. Only a man named Bobby left the boat but did not lived. He is last seen all alone among the waves. Back at shore a memorial ceremony is carried out while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home.
This movie is much more real world than most disaster films. Big storms that flip ships are very real. Supercells are very likely to come to the new England area like Sandy. Also, it is very possible for people to die via drowning in a storm. However, the fishermen should have not gone out to the ocean. They know that it was late in the season and a big storm was coming. If they would have nit gone, they would have lived. Next the helicopter should not have crashed because the National Guard knew how powerful the storm was and risked their lives. The crew on the boat need help may not come but when anyway because of money.",The Perfect Storm

This movie is definitely fiction. There has got to be no question of that. And it's too bad really, because the more realistic version would have been very interesting and so-much-more thoughtful. I was definitely hoping for it actually, and felt I got nowhere near what it was worth. While it's incredible that people really do choose professions that involve this kind of extremity, the people in this movie would have had not the depth to endeavor anything outside of the tides of the Hollywood box office. Not that Clooney didn't do a good job. He was alright, all the characters were okay, but come on. Character development can be more than wild cheering after the action hits. It had moments, they were it's own too, I supposed. All in all I was sitting and thinking that so many of these happenings were pretty unlikely and in the meantime watching the characters flicker back and forth; occasionally being distracted by the imagination surrounding the action of the sea and thinking of how amazing it would be to have real experiences like that. And it would be. Also the fish cruelty I didn't really care for.",The Perfect Storm

From what I heard of the movie, I thought I'd be sitting down to an overdone theme of weather as the bad guy played out with millions of dollars of visual effects and bad acting.  But with Petersen at the helm, it's clearly worth watching. The Perfect Storm is a film that reminds us that movies are for entertainment.  A simple story of American fisherman is brought to life with very good special effects, and that's all the movie is supposed to be. This isn't the type of movie that requires 10 viewings to grasp the depth and symbolism, just an appreciation for simple cinema.   But there's nothing simple about the special effects that bring this storm alive. Only if the movie could dump gallons of water into the theater during the storm scenes could the movie seem more real. To know that the movie was filmed on a sound stage INDOORS is even more amazing. (The DVD extras show all this)I wasn't a big fan of the acting from the leads or the introduction in the beginning, but the movie as a whole is definitely entertaining. But Petersen's determination to make this movie seem as real as possible is a success, even though his creation (the storm) dominates as the lead role.",The Perfect Storm

This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen with the audience being asked to accept impossible situations, cliché characters, an appalling musak score and 2 hours of boredom in a bathtub. There is no way, for example, that people on a boat could walk around on deck in some of the effects-waves we were asked to watch, and no way a helicopter could stay aloft in winds we were asked to accept. God knows what George Clooney was doing in this dog - maybe had a contractual obligation or somesuch. This movie is an example of the power of mass marketing and is without value except at the box office. The only redeeming feature is that it didn't run to 3 hrs.

Throughout the film I kept visualising an orchestra just outside the filmic frame, on land, but more so on the high tides themselves.

If they were going to mess with established facts, they should have thrown in Iraqi and Irish terrorists, giant ship hunting sharks, and the vengeful ghost of the Titanic.

Her delivery is so realistic and has such a sense of immediacy that you feel as though you are standing right beside her, totally engrossed in her dilemma.George Clooney gives an exceptional and convincing performance as Captain Billy Tyne.  He has a subtlety of expression that can speak volumes and easily break your heart.  He made me glad I did not have Billy's job. And, although, he needs no words to get his thoughts across, when he does speak, his timing and throaty voice can be totally entrancing.John Hawkes and Rusty Schwimmer shine.

I was also astounded that the strength of humankind was shown so badly- surely if you were in that sort of situation, you would pull together better than that? It is such a bad interpretation that I was really tempted to turn it off half way through.

Although sappy at times I felt that there was some decent character development.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Mark Wahlberg did very well and even George Clooney had his moments.

It did, only slightly, but even then the way in which the crew members on the boat related to each other made me very seasick! I won't bother to relate the particular moments that had me reaching for the sick-bag, anyway there were too many.

But when massive hurricanes collide, peril and major special effects follow.  The premise is not half bad: peril or pride?  Keep going to get fish, or return home as losers?  However, after about 65 minutes, the film begins to lose its edge.  For the remaining piece of the movie, all we see is a stormy sea, with nothing new really happening. Also, a subplot dealing with the Coast Guard during the storm is out of place and takes up too much screen time.  The movie is overdramatic as well. Nearly every time a character speaks, cheesy, weepy music is played.  The dialogue, which fills the ""weepmusic"" time is sub-par and can be found in any disaster movie.  These are all the traits of a bad film.  As a New Englander, I cannot forget to mention the terrible, fake Boston accents coming from everyone.However, we must also look at the bright sides of things.  There are many grade A actors in The Perfect Storm.  Clooney, Wahlberg, Reilly, and the other members provide worthy performances.  I also have to give credit to all the cast and crew of The Perfect Storm because I know the film could not have been easy to make.  All of the actors on the boat became very sick because of the violent sea, and the boat apparently administered many physical beatings.  The numerous special effects do provide entertainment, and the friendship between the members on the Andrea Gail appears real.Overall, Wolgang Petersen's ""Perfect Storm"" is par for the course in a mental aspect, but the physical action is adrenaline-pumping and exciting.

Apparently, however, Boston accents are someone's idea of ""characters"", and inane dialogue and sappy scenes, their idea of story.That being said, I was pretty involved in what was going on here - the waves, wind, spray - Peterson really manages to keep the tension going for a long while.

Instead of feeling real care for these people, we're asked to see them as stand-ins, background for the special effects, and despite the cast's best efforts to hold their ground and not get blown away by the special effects (and considering what they're up against, they don't do badly) they're not really given much to work with.Three points for the special effects.  Two for the cast.  Five blown out to sea.",The Perfect Storm
499,kevinswiber,Horrible depiction of a true story due to poor acting and less-than-mediocre film-making.,4,3 July 2000,"I did not enjoy this movie at all, and the hype surrounding it would suggest that I'm in the minority of 18-year-old males who will watch this film.George Clooney's acting was typical of his past work.  Not coincidentally, I'm sure, he was the only actor casted for the movie who wasn't forced to use a Massachusetts accent.  How convenient for you, eh, Mr. Clooney?  I'm sure you wouldn't want to try flexing what little acting muscles you may have, no matter how weak they are.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's part was too small and insignificant for an actress of her caliber.  The story wouldn't have drastically changed if her part didn't even exist.  Another typical character in this movie was played by Mark Wahlberg, known for his roles as a dumb kid aching to change his life for the better.  The acting was unimpressive.Characters are thrown in simply for effect.  Sure, the movie emphasizes survival in horrid conditions, but tossing unknown vacationers into the plot out of nowhere and spending much time showing what these people--who the viewer doesn't even care about due to a lack of background story--are doing is just bad screen-writing, in my opinion.The theme of the movie, one would believe, is about bravery in dangerous times, and while multiple themes are not necessarily a bad thing, the idea of everlasting love did not mesh well with the rest of this story.All in all, it was a poor film wrapped around amazing visual effects.  But guess what; all of the rain, waves, and wind in the world couldn't save this movie from drowning in lack of quality.  Don't bother wasting your time or your money.",The Perfect Storm

Not only is the acting bad, but the writing is even worse.  When George Clooney uttered the line, ""This is the moment of truth, when we separate the men from the boys,"" I truly realized how awful the script was.  The only redeeming factor would be the special effects and it was nothing like the sinking Titanic in ""Titanic"".  It's pretty much just some big waves.

501,lirunner,it never let me down,8,3 July 2000,"Unlike the massive wave that dropped the Andria Gail into the deep blue depths of the north Atlantic, this picture never dropped me from the perch of excitement that built throughout the movie. The build-up of characters which launches the film creates a solid foundation on which the viewer latches on when the s**t hits the fan a thousand miles away in the thundering storm. The only negative I found was a minor one. I thought, possibly, the storm action scenes went on a tad to long. Otherwise, the only other item is a personel one. I am a Meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The NWS was at the lead in identifing this storm and forecasting its actions. The cheesey bafoon who played the TV weatherman, and got the credit for the forecasting of the storm, was an insult. However, this did NOT take anything away from the movie.",The Perfect Storm

The actions of the Coast Guard were heroic and worth telling a story about.  The fishermen just the opposite.**** Spoiler Follows ****This just wasn't a tale worth telling.  The fishermen made a terrible decision in a dangerous situation and paid the ultimate price - something that happens every day to people everywhere.  I see telling the story of people who survive difficult circumstances or people who are killed in extraordinary circumstances, but these men knew they were heading into life-threatening danger and did it any way.

I hate to criticize fellow Austinite Bill Wittliff (screenwriter), but Bill, please, stop hitting us over the head with the f***ed up relationships of the noble, manly Gloucestermen of the sea. The back stories were forced and contrived. The conflict between ""Sully"" and ""Murph"" was stupid and inexplicable. Diane Lane was so annoying as Wahlberg's girlfriend that I would have been dying to get back out to sea. The lives of drunken fishermen aren't that exciting, so why not get us out on the water right away? Once they finally got out on the water, the movie picked up. Once they get into the storm, the drama was absolutely gripping. In fact, if the movie had told the story of the Coast Guard badasses that had to rescue these dopes, then you've got a great movie. There was a good half-hour to 45 minutes of really spectacular filmmaking, but an imperfect script ruined The Perfect Storm.

It was as if I had to hold my breath when a wave hit.I don't care much for the storyline dealing with relationships - which I suppose is a necessary evil to get to the storm itself.I equate watching the effects of this movie with the 2nd half of Titanic, where the boat sinks (Ooops - Did I just spoil Titanic for you? Sorry) or the spacewalk sequences in Mission to Mars.. Or any part of the tornados in Twister.It will amaze you too when you see the movie people turn on mother nature with the flick of a switch.Basically, if you're into effects - you'll love these!",The Perfect Storm

The plot was nearly non-existent.  Scenes jumped from multiple storylines, some of which had no bearing on anything. The scenes with the small boat that whose survivors were rescued first was there just to have some filler material.

506,joe90-4,The Perfect Yawn,1,29 June 2000,"This movie stinks more than a bucket of fish guts on a summers day. Basically, George Clooney & trawler pals go out fishing, end up in a huge storm and get washed away by giant waves. Get the picture? The script was obviously washed out to sea too as they made this pathetic sea shanty, with every stereotypical disaster cliché known to the most jaded summer movie-goer. With cute kids, wailing girlfriends, a weatherman who gets off on storm cells and a group of testosterone-driven fishermen, more intent on saving a load of frozen fish than their own stupid lives. How bloody ridiculous (and time-consuming!) Clooney has seen better days. Since the Titty Twister movie and Out of Sight, George has been pretty disappointing. This movie will do little to help. Every line George gets has him raving about ""being men, not little boys"" . For Gods sake, if they had the budget to recreate the giant wave from Deep Impact, they could have invested in a decent script, and a razor or two. George has even brought along his friend Marky Mark, who quite frankly I had more respect for as a new kid on the block. I cared so much about the rest of the cast, you could feed them to the fishes anyway. Director Wolfgang Petersen has done so much better than this with Das Boot and Air Force One. Where the hell was he going with this pathetic drivel? Even the music, by James Horner, was re-hashed themes from Deep Impact. They weren't content with just stealing the giant wave? So where are we going this summer. In my mind there has been one, and one only - Gladiator. The rest, including this, has been a bunch of brain mush. I feel like I'm being fed by the Hollywood food drip. Sucking people simultaneously into multiplexes all over the world and feeding them mindless epics like MI2, Gone In 60 Seconds (I certainly hope so) and this aquatic farce which should sink into the depths like the Waterworld it is. Come on, wake up Hollywood, wake up World. If you want to spend some time in the waves, I'd strongly suggest an afternoon at Wet 'n' Wild.

The writers try so hard in the first hour or so to get me to identify with the characters, so my experience would be more intense as I worry about them when the storm hits.

However: this movie will not win any Oscars for acting/script either.  The f/x are surely good enough to get a nomination. From what I've read from other reviewers, it seems that if you read the book, you like the movie. Well, I did read the book, so I am biased as well. The book was good, and it's important to keep in mind that this is a true story, so it limits the 'artistic license' of the director, etc. The movie is basically an unfolding of events, not a plot-oriented film. So just sit back and watch them unfold. The bottom line is: the movie is Very Good (7.6/10)...of course it may be b/c I relate to the characters in the film (I've spent  some time at sea, and have seen a few storms).

Then they head home straight into ""the perfect storm"" because they're too short on cash and too revved up on testosterone to heed the weather reports. Most of the rest of the film is johnny-on- the-spot there with them in the storm. But once in a while the story cuts to a sailboat in a storm near Bermuda whose captain has decided to pay no attention to the weather reports. And we're supposed to care about all these idiots. Meanwhile the entire Coast Guard and Air Reserve inexplicably seem to have only one helicopter to try to rescue everyone no matter how big the Atlantic Ocean is and how far apart these idiot-laden boats are. Even if you have a satisfactory knowledge of geography and can picture Bermuda, you have no idea where that darn Flemish Cap is in relation to Canada, Greenland, Iceland, England, the Azores, until you get home and study an atlas. I walked into the theater expecting a ""meteorology"" movie, like ""Twister,""  but ""The Perfect Storm"" teaches nothing about meteorology. All we get is a few seconds of a TV weather guy drooling over his computer screen and naming this double hurricane ""the perfect storm."" So then I decided this must be a ""disaster"" movie, like ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" but the fisherman protagonists are too unlikeable. Also, we get no clue how rescue efforts are coordinated, and the scenes about a sailboat near Bermuda don't fit. The movie is based on a book about real people who died in a real storm. If this isn't a meteorology movie and it isn't a disaster movie, perhaps the purpose of the movie is to show the stories of real people who died in a real storm. Perhaps I would have appreciated the movie if I had read the book. But I haven't read the book, and the movie really doesn't stand on its own. I -- and the rest of the audience -- walked out of the theater at the end with blank expressions on our faces. I didn't care one whit who died in this movie and who didn't, even if they were once upon a time real people. The movie failed to make me care. I'll say a two good things about this movie. 1) It's exciting. You never know what's going to whack, snare, or drown the individual characters at any given moment.

First of all: the story sucks. The coastguard storyline has nothing to do with the fishing boat, and frankly annoyed the hell out of me.The main story is also kind of empty: a boat sets out, a storm comes, everyone dies. This ending makes all the other stories about the people left behind kind of obsolete. At the end I was thinking ""they spent all this time introducing so many characters.......why???"". Maybe they wanted to create sympathy for the fishermen, but this didn't work for me. Further more: the storm looked great for about 5 minutes, but then I got the feeling I was watching the same footage for about an hour. The telepathy thing was also kind of annoying.

It's a dangerous job, but one they love, and most of them go because they can make a lot of money on one trip if the conditions are right and they catch enough fish. We get to know the characters, Billy Tyne, the captain who is outfished by fellow woman swordboat captain, Linda Greenlaw, and is a little sensitive about it. There's Bobby Shatford the rookie fisherman and his girlfriend Christina Cotter who are trying to make a new start. Bobby wants to take one more trip out to pay off his divorce lawyer and his debts. Bugsy (Michael) Moran who only wants a woman to love him, who tries to pick up Irene, a single mother in the bar.  She doesn't leave with him that night, but sees him off when the boat goes out.  Alfred Pierre, the black guy who's crazy about his girlfriend(we don't see too much of him),and Murph (Dale Murphy) who's crazy about his little boy and feeling sort of unhappy about his divorce, and Sully (David Sullivan) the last minute substitute. Sully and Murph don't like each other.The guys leave Gloucester on a foggy morning in early October for the Grand Banks, catch a few swordfish, and then nothing.  Things happen, accidents, a shark, and a rogue wave, and then the men start getting restless,and want to go home.  The Captain says ""No, we're going to the Flemish Cap.""  They catch a lot of fish there,fill the fish hold, but then the ice machine dies. To complicate matters a big storm (2 storm fronts colliding with a hurricane) is right in their path going home.  They're faced with either waiting it out and losing their big catch, or going home through this big storm.  Most of them are experienced fishermen who have been through bad storms before, and they're so tired at this point that they decide, to plow through the storm anyway not knowing how bad it will get.  The special effects are awesome. It gets VERY wet and windy out there and you wonder how the boat can keep afloat.  There's a great sense of loyalty and heroics among the men.

The realism of the story line has a single big hole in it. That is why you didn't hear a lot about this film by word-of-mouth. People wouldn't talk about the film, because doing so would spoil the film for others.What was the intention of the screen play writer? Was it to bring glory to the lives of the merchant fishermen? The film left me with a sunken feeling. (No pun intented). I didn't enjoy the films conclusion. Movies like this had their place in the depressing, realistic 1970's. I hope this isn't a trend in the 2000's.",The Perfect Storm

REALLY terrible acting, the musical score practically deafens you every 3 minutes or so... and what a ridiculous script! i know it's based on a true story, but come on! do you really expect me to believe that a guy would go overboard in the ocean with a fishing hook and line stuck in his hand and then another guy on the boat would jump in and... save him? give me a break. i had never heard such cheesy dialogue in such a melodramatic piece of crap. i can't believe the money they spent to make this film. the only good part of the movie you saw in the trailer so don't waste your time, unless you actually like seeing George Clooney saying some of the hokiest lines ever.",The Perfect Storm

I really don't understand why this film was so bad.  It is an incredible film that has been misinterpreted by ALL of the critics.The development of the characters was fantastic as they were based upon the real life people of the event that took place.  The acting was perhaps the highlight of the film showing man against nature, the triumphs and failures. All captured in the tragic story of lost fishermen.  I found them to be very believable and related to the characters very well.  I was very impressed with the special effects and Wolfgang's attempt to place us with them in the storm.  It was very overwhelming at times to think about what had happened during that storm.  This was a human interest story more than anything.I wish people would look for something more in this film besides the critic's desire to criticize for the sake of criticism.  I highly recommended this film.  It is definitely at the top of my all time favorites list.",The Perfect Storm

543,Trewas,Better to watch any three Deadliest Catch episodes...,4,30 July 2008,"Overall I am very disappointed because any three episodes (matching the length of this movie) of the reality TV-show Deadliest Catch does much more convincing and entertaining job of presenting dangers of the sea than this bland big budget movie.All characters here are very two dimensional, even though the beginning of the movie is wasted to character building. Even worse than the uninspiring characters are the music selections, most of the time best suited to the movie moment ""the junior gets a home run in a softball game"". Men wasting their lives in the dangerous sea deserve some more dramatic music than what is best described by adjectives ""bland"", ""hopeful"" and most of all ""cliched"". The computer generated graphics also are quite bad as they look just what they sound like, computer generated.A much better movie could have been created from these ingredients, as most of the actors have proved to be quite good ones in other movies and the subject could also have entertaining without the bland presentation.",The Perfect Storm

I give it a ten.George Clooney is a fantastic captain. He really gets into character. Mark Walhberg and he have great chemistry on the set.The story is about a fishing crew of six men aboard the Andrea Gail. They find that their ice machine is broken and the only way to get to their destination without the fish rotting is through a gigantic storm. They head out are immediately swamped. Death seems to be inevitable through the entire last half of the movie.A coast guard and a few of his men also have their special scenes where they try to rescue another group of people on a different ship. The movie contains their survival/deaths (I won't reveal it) and what happened to them.Overall the movie is compelling and intense with dramatic ending scenes.

I re-read the novel recently and thought I should watch the movie. I couldn't.

As usual they took these parts and ran with them, turning in more powerful performances than such A-list actors as George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The only thing I would have liked to have seen would have been more of ""Linda Greenlaw"". As anyone who has read her book can tell you, her story alone would makes for excellent telling.

Wolgang both captured the reality these men were living in and also captured the storm not just the storm but the storm in their lives. You really imagine yourself as one of the seamen and being put in their situation (he does well in firstly showing their private lives) Then showing their frustrations when they have to embark on their journey again.Before I am tempted to tell the whole story let me stop.Overall the cast was really amazing especially Mark and George and the story was really mind-provoking.If you enjoy sea movies you will truly like this one.I give it 4 1/2 out of 5...:)",The Perfect Storm

The Perfect Storm relates to the experience of the Andrea Gayle and its crew during the 'storm of the century' in the early nineties. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg act as brave and passionate fishermen taking to the sea and bravely keeping with their goal despite tremendous hardships. Their friends and family live in the Massachussetts town of Gloucester. Clooney plays Billy Tyne once a legendary captain who needs a big catch to keep up with his reputation. Mark Wahlberg plays as Bobby Shatford, a young fisherman whose fiancé is waiting impatiently for his return in Gloucester. Unfortunately, despite their desperate attempts, the crew is trapped in the ferocious sea and never makes it back to shore. The most poignant line of the movie is when Bobby knowing he is about to drown says to himself thinking of his fiancé, Christina: ""There is only love, Christina, only love"".",The Perfect Storm

I have spent hours pouring over accounts of what actually happened to the Andrea Gail and what they all say is that no one really knows what happened.So what I do not understand is how someone could presume to write a book and then make a movie about the events that transpired during this tragedy. If I had lost a loved one and had no way of knowing what happened to them I would be so angry if someone made a romanticized movie about their death.I think this movie could have served a much better purpose of making the public aware of the hardships, triumphs and tragedies of longliner fisherman without being a 2 hour long hope film where there was no hope.",The Perfect Storm
553,ber06122,Very Disappointing,3,20 October 2004,"The book made a fascinating read, but the big problem with adapting it into a movie was that large portion of the Andrea Gail storyline was guess work on the part of Sebastian Junger since no one really knows what happened to the ship and its crew members, and there is no record of what occurred on her final voyage outside of information relayed in radio traffic to ships that survived the storm. Junger's guesswork is good, and forms only part of the story of the book. This movie, however, storms into the gap by taking characters based on real people and turning them into stereo type. I knew something was amiss when I was listening to the dialogue spouting from the mouths of Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney towards the end of the movie and the thought occurred to me that no Gloucester Fisherman would talk like that in that situation. The Andrea Gail section of this movie, which is about 70% of the movie seems contrived, artificial, fake, it's very Hollywood - stoic heroic dying fisherman, stoic wives and girlfriends (tragic heroines) awaiting them at home, and evil fishing boat owner who drove his men to a suicide mission. As usual, reality is much more interesting, and subtle. I'm not saying this story would not make a fascinating, gripping, and ultimately tragic movie. But the producers and writers have taken a host of unknowns and filled in the blanks with details that ring completely false.That said, the best part and most thrilling part of the movie (and the part that rings most true) is the Coast Guard rescue scene of the downed Air Force Rescue Helicopter and the small private boat. This scene is so terrifying because it is based on eyewitness accounts and the producers decided to hew closely to the actual events (which indicates to me the good intent of the producers, despite the botched job).The CGI is serviceable but not great. It gives a sense of scale, but does not fool the eye. At the same time, when will a film crew ever be able to film 100 foot seas?This movie was disappointing but well intentioned. At the very least it brings home the plight of fishermen everywhere who work their deadly jobs in the hopes of bettering themselves. I admire the spirit. I just did not like the product.",The Perfect Storm
554,mikequig,Comments,10,22 December 2004,"I was reading the comments posted, and I would like to make a few comments. The bottom line is the crew of the Andrea Gail, was comprised of six guys who were earning a living, providing for their families, and worked a physically and mentally challenging job. I feel the movie brought that point across, and the rest was purely Hollywood fictionalization placing it's spin on this real life tragedy. In the movie, I don't care who said what to whom, whose girlfriend said what, who fought with whom, the bottom line is six guys battled incredible odds, ""The Perfect Storm"" and lost their lives in that battle and in the performance of their jobs. That's the point, that's what the movie was about, and that's what the director brought across to the viewer. If you want a more accurate account of actual events then purchase the book, and read it, because the book goes into the individual personalities and the relationships between characters. As for the exact recount of the final moments of the crew of the Andrea Gale, according to the Official Coast Guard Report, the cause of this tragedy is unknown. Also unknown are the actual events, mechanical problems encountered by the vessel, and all interactions and communications among the crew. No matter what the movie communicates to audiences, the cause of this tragedy is unknown and will remain that way for eternity. That portion of the movie which takes place after the Andre Gail's final radio transmission is totally unknown and is purely fictionalized. I feel we can all make are own assessments on what happened and what was said. We do know the vessel sank and six lives were tragically lost. Therefore it really doesn't what the movie depicts.I appreciate watching a movie about six men who worked hard, battled the elements, battled the ""Perfect Storm"" provided for their families, and lost their lives in the performance of their jobs. Again, that's what this movie was about and that's what the director, producer and actors expertly communicated to the viewers. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to learn about The Andrea Gail and her crew. After serving in the military for 25 years I feel somewhat qualified to say that each member of the Andrea Gail crew were heroes in their own way, and I pray for their souls and for their families.

It got so that I was predicting...queue the happy elated music...queue the ominous music. It was a bit over the top for me. It reminded me of the Jurrasic Park movies which also contain over the top music. Otherwise, I would've voted for 7 or 8 as the movie did entertain me. I do appreciate good movie music, but film makers need to use it sparingly to enhance response, not create response.

As others have said before, this is a recreation and interpretation of the events. It was not meant to be spot on! We will never know what actually happened on the boat; in that sense I disregard anyone who says that it was false and wrong. A user previously reviewed that they disliked how Hollywood portrayed the women in this film, for making them seem too emotional and stereotypical. Especially the opening scene when Diane Lane wakes up from a nightmare about her boyfriend on the ocean. Can I just say, that as someone who had a brother who fished and has numerous close friends who fish or are married/dating fishermen, I always was worried if they would come home safe. Anyone who has anyone that they love out there thinks the same things and worries constantly about it until they are home. I have known a few people who were lost out on the sea and it is NOT unreasonable or over-sensitive to portray people (male or female) as being over emotional for having nightmares about those they love who are out fishing. It is fact. Obviously this user has NO IDEA what it's like for families of those out there putting their lives at risk.I thought this movie was overall very, very good.

558,jsgbuckton,Cheese,4,28 August 2005,"I watched this film on TV last night and found it made me quite emotional. Unfortunately I don't think I became emotional in the way Wolfgang Peterson quite intended. No, I felt not sadness when watching this film. The emotions I experienced were feelings of amusement, occasional boredom (if you can call that an emotion) and intense rage.Before I slag this film off too much I should point out that I did find it entertaining in parts. But I don't think this was intentional.Now, I only saw this on TV, so maybe the effects were a little lost, but for the most part you could tell it was CGI. I'm surprised this film won prizes for its effects - maybe 2000 was a bad year. The second problem with the effects was when people fell in the water in the middle of the biggest hurricane in recorded history, they seemed to float in a fairly steady position, almost like they were standing on the bottom of a swimming pool. This leads me to make my second criticism.This film was, in parts, unrealistic. I find this a large problem since it's based on a true story. Why, every time the guys went fishing, did they all start cheering. There was even a bit when they were packing swordfish in ice in an overenthusiastic manner.I stayed up late and watched this film for 2hrs 30mins, expecting something, somewhere to have a consequence or payoff of some kind. Instead, everyone dies at the end. If I'd known that was going to happen, I wouldn't have bothered watching the preceding 2hrs 20mins.Overall I felt this was a typically cheesy piece of Hollywood claptrap, which exploited a real life tragedy in order to make a special effects blockbuster movie.

560,matthewrenae,"Beautiful, Bountiful, and Unpredictable",8,26 January 2015,"""The Perfect Storm"" is an exhilarating portrayal of just how unpredictable Mother Nature can be upon the open seas. Sword fishing vessel Andrea Gail, captained by Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is forced to take a gamble that could end in large, much needed profit or the loss of his ship and crew. A cold front moving from Canada to the east and another front moving in from the west converge off the New England coast in the Atlantic Ocean, feeding the existing Hurricane Grace in the middle. Andrea Gail and her crew must either sail straight through the storm before their haul spoils or turn tail to get out of the hurricane on steroids, thus risking their jobs. The film's meteorologist Todd Gross (Christopher McDonald) deems this highly unusual natural phenomenon terrorizing all in its course ""the perfect storm.""This ""storm of the century"" is a cinematic depiction of the actual super storm that took place along the New England coast during the Halloween of 1991. A combination of sheer natural power and technological failure pushes the Andrea Gail and crew to their limits and beyond. Even with the U.S. Coast Guard scouring the Atlantic with all their resources and search- and-rescue expertise, this meteorological disaster of epic proportions shows no mercy and yields little hope for survivors. ""The Perfect Storm"" serves as commemoration to the thousands of fishermen who have lost their lives seeking the Atlantic's bounty and truly reminds its audience what it means to be alive, and dry.",The Perfect Storm
561,scott-raulerson,The Perfect Storm Indeed,8,9 February 2015,"""The Perfect Storm"" is a fast-paced and dramatic thriller, which is based on a true story. It is set in the waters east of Gloucester, Massachusetts in the fall of 1991. At the end of dismal fishing season, the swordfish boat Andrea Gail and her crew go out for one last run of the season, before a much-needed break. After setting the lines and hitting big numbers, the ship is forced to turn home to unload its catch early. In its return trip, the Andrea Gail gets caught between Hurricane Grace and an unnamed nor'easter. The movie touches on some of the science behind the storm and for the most part it was accurate. The low-pressure nor'easter absorbed Hurricane Grace, producing a massive storm. The movie makes out the convergent storm to be once in a lifetime, which it is. A hurricane powering a cyclone doesn't happen frequently. One thing I felt was very interesting in the movie was the response of the Coast Guard. It's thought provoking when you realize they were out at sea during a storm that was powerful enough to thoroughly restrict even the Coast Guard Search and Rescue from doing their job. There is not much you can do when the rescuers need rescuing. It further exemplifies the audacity and bravery that the crew showed in being out on the water during the storm.",The Perfect Storm

563,philippal,Close but no cigar,5,24 May 2006,"The Perfect Storm is one of those irritating films which have all the ingredients to be terrific and then fall short of the mark.Since no one actually knows what happened to the Andrea Gail and her crew, the director had free reign. Unfortunately, he and the script writer opted for cardboard cutouts rather than true character development. Truly a shame as the supporting cast, (with one or two exceptions) was wonderful.First, the film suffered from a lack of focus. Was it an action/adventure film, a character study or a documentary? Since the Andrea Gail and her crew and friends took up most of the screen time, the director would have been better served to eliminate the side stories of the Air National Guard helicopter rescue and the sailing vessel. The actors in those story lines had so little screen time, we never knew who they were nor cared to.My reasoning for the five stars is based totally on the Andrea Gail's crew: Reilly, Fichner and Hawkes. Clooney and Wahlberg turned in solid performances - although I think Wahlberg had a better grasp on his character. Mastrantonio spent all her time dining on the scenery (*whoa*) and the usually strong Diane Lane never really caught in her role as the girlfriend.It is the three character actors in the crew who made the film worth watching. Reilly has such a wonderfully live-in face, he's believable from minute one. Fichtner is equally terrific as the crass, short-tempered Sully. (I wonder if the explanation for their mutual dislike ended up on the cutting room floor?) And Hawkes was perfect as the scrawny, worked-hard-all-his-life guy who never gets a break. If Peterson had allowed they guys more screen time, the film would have been the better for it.I won't bother discussing the special effects and the storm. It was all well done, but there was *way* too much of it. Still, worth renting on a slow evening.",The Perfect Storm
