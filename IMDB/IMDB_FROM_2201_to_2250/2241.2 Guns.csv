0,bkoganbing,Separate infiltrations,3,24 March 2014,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who've certainly been better on the screen separately get to team together inn 2 Guns. This is a film that has a great deal of trouble on how much it wants to be taken seriously.These two go undercover to bust a drug cartel lord played by Edward James Olmos. The problem is Washington is a DEA agent and Mark Wahlberg is in Naval Intelligence. Neither of these guys knows the other is an agent.One fine days Wahlberg and Washington decide to rob a local bank where the cartel keeps money and drugs stashed. Just like in an infinitely better film Charley Varrick there's a lot more there than what they expected. Turns out the CIA keeps some emergency operating cash there to the tune of 40 million dollars. After that both agencies disown these two and they're on their own, but they're fairly resourceful as you see.I had too much trouble deciding on how seriously to take 2 Guns. In the end I just didn't care. Both leads deserved something a whole lot better if they ever team again.",2 Guns
1,Leofwine_draca,Starts off great...,5,1 December 2015,"2 GUNS is a film with a fantastic opening scene: thrilling, funny, sharply written, reminiscent of Tarantino's PULP FICTION. It introduces Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington as a pair of thieves who spend the whole film wisecracking and falling out, but there are twists involved with their characters and this turns into a post-modern version of LETHAL WEAPON.Sadly, the rest of the film can't sustain the quality of the opening set-piece, and 2 GUNS turns into a fairly ordinary thriller with some good dialogue to recommend it. Washington seems to be effortlessly able to turn his hand to any role he takes on and he's excellent in this, and Wahlberg provides a good foil too. Apparently these guys ad-libbed a lot of their own dialogue and the camaraderie between them feels naturalistic.The plotting is very predictable stuff and needlessly convoluted in places. It's one of those films where everyone seems to be corrupt and is after the central characters. It does feature a number of familiar faces parts in various roles, actors including James Marsden, Bill Paxton, Fred Ward, and Edward James Olmos, the latter a welcome return to the big screen after being off it for many years. There's sex, violence, lots of raucous humour, and more besides, but 2 GUNS lacks real character to make it stand out. Washington and Wahlberg deserved a better movie.",2 Guns
2,SnoopyStyle,Convoluted mess,5,12 June 2014,"Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are a couple of bank robbers who want to buy from drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). DEA Agents Rees (Paula Patton) and Jessup (Robert John Burke) are after Papi Greco. It turns out that Trench is an undercover DEA agent. Trench decides to follow Stigman's scheme to rob the bank, steal Papi's money around $3M, and take down Trench at the bank. Only Stigman is Naval Intelligence who is also after Papi. The robbery nets much more money than expected over $43M. Stigman shoots Trench and takes off with the money. It turns out that the money belong to Earl (Bill Paxton) and part of corrupt CIA. Quince (James Marsden) who is running the Naval operation isn't above board either and tries to kill Stigman while keeping the money for himself.This is a convoluted mess. The movie starts with a bit of believability then kept piling on more and more illogical craziness. As the movie progress, the less sense it makes. Eventually I gave up trying to accept any of it. The chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg is surprisingly weak. These are two top actors in the buddy action comedy genre. Yet they never really develop. All that is left is a lot of mindless action.",2 Guns
3,Prismark10,"Guns, banks and diners",5,13 November 2013,"2 Guns would be the type of Denzel Washington vehicle that would had been directed by one of his regular directors Tony Scott who died in 2012.2 Guns is a smart, hip action thriller wannabe which is not as smart or hip it thinks it is.In fact I found it pedestrian and predictable.It starts out almost Tarantino style in a diner. Things get a bit heated later on with a topless Paula Patton. We have a side serving of some interesting bad guys ranging from the Navy, CIA and Mexican cartels.Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg play seemingly two small time crooks but one is with the DEA and the other is an undercover naval intelligence officer. Both under deep cover and both unaware of each others identity.So we are soon involved in a cat and mouse chase, there is double crossing, you even can work out who did the double crossing. There are some dirty CIA officers all it all leads to one big shoot out.Washington and Wahlberg start out as buddies, then fall out once their true identities are revealed but have to work together to get themselves out of their predicament.A director with flair and panache could had made more of this story, maybe instilled it with some better twists and a more interesting visual flair.It is decent popcorn entertainment. Both leads are fine with Washington never having to leave second gear. Wahlberg adds some humour.",2 Guns
4,nogodnomasters,AND BECAUSE ITS OUR MONEY,8,29 July 2018,"Bobby (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent working with Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) who in undercover Navy Intelligence. Each thinks the other is just a bad guy. Together they rob a bank on orders so as to steal money from a drug cartel. This way the money can be seized as evidence in a crime and they don't need a warrant, as if that has stopped them before. Things become confused as the there is more money than expected.The banter between Wahlberg and Washington is what makes the film. They are too cool together. It is a fun popcorn film with comedy, dark comedy, and plenty of action. Good characters in a plot that was predictable. Worth seeing after you have seen Reds 2.Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief nudity (Paula Patton).",2 Guns
5,kosmasp,Bad can be good,8,25 May 2014,"If an action movie goes into the comedy territory it risks repelling the action audience it was targeting. Not all the jokes might find the viewers taste as responsive as the think it is. Clearly this movie has quality (although as another reviewer already stated, this is not a masterpiece), but it's about the chemistry.A buddy movie can only work, if there is chemistry, not only friendship, but maybe even rivalry. And this movie does have that with our two leads, which makes you wonder, why Denzel and Mark haven't been teamed up before. They do work fantastic off each other. It's not a family movie though, because there is violence and the jokes (most of them) are aimed at a grown up audience (with a particular sense of humor that is). It's a great movie, if you can find a way to access it",2 Guns
6,jboothmillard,2 Guns,7,12 November 2017,"I missed this film on TV a couple of times, I remember it obviously for the two leading actors, I couldn't guess anything about the plot from the title, so I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, directed by Baltasar Kormákur (Contraband, Everest). Basically criminals Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are planning to $3 million stashed in the vault of the Tres Cruces bank. Unknown to Stig, Bobby is an undercover DEA agent trying to convict Manny ""Papi"" Greco (Edward James Olmos) in Mexico, he failed to acquire to use as evidence, so he plans to prosecute Pape with money laundering, he will remain undercover until after the robbery. While Bobby is having a rendezvous with fellow DEA agent and former lover Deb Rees (Paula Patton), he is unaware that Stig is also undercover, he is an Intelligence Specialist with the Navy SEALs, he has been instructed to kill Bobby so the Navy can use the stolen money to fund unauthorised covert operations. During the heist, Bobby and Stig are surprised to find $43.125 million in the vault, after the heist, Stig follows the orders of his commanding officer LCDR Harold Quince (James Marsden), to betray Bobby and escape with the money. But Stig is unwilling to kill Bobby, he shoots him in the shoulder, a flesh wound, then he sees Bobby's DEA badge, not sure what to think, he leaves Bobby in the desert and takes the money. Stig meets with Quince, who tries to kill him when he learns what happened, Stig escapes after learning the money will be transferred to a Navy base in Corpus Christi. Meanwhile a man named Earl (Bill Paxton), head of a shadowy organisation, aggressively interrogates the Tres Cruces bank manager about the stolen money, he tracks Bobby's movements. Bobby goes to Stig's apartment to find where he took the money, Sniper however is outside, watching with a sniper's rifle, Quince has sent a hit squad to attack the apartment, but Bobby and Stig escape. Bobby visits his superior DEA Special Agent Jessup (Robert John Burke) to tell him what happened, but Earl and his men are waiting for him, Earl kills Jessup, frames Bobby for the murder, he makes a deal with Bobby if the $43 million is returned, he will be cleared. Bobby and Stig kidnap Papi to interrogate him in the garage at Deb's house, they find out Earl is a black ops operative to whom Papi reports, and that the stolen money belongs to the CIA. The garage is attacked by another hit squad, led by Quince, the trio end up being captured by Papi and taken to his farm in Mexico, after beating them and receiving a visit from Earl, the pair are given 24 hours to steal the money from the Navy and return it, or Deb will die. At the base, infiltrating Quince's office, Bobby discovers Quince is Deb's boyfriend, they had planned to steal the money for themselves, meanwhile Stig asks Admiral Tuwey (Fred Ward), but Tuway does not the scandal to tarnish the Navy's reputation, Quince evades arrest, as does Stig. Bobby is unable to find the money and thinks it is too late to save Deb, but then he realises the money is stashed in a motel room he and Deb frequented, he goes to help Stig, who is returning to Papi's farm alone to exact revenge. At the farm, Stig is surrounded by Papi's men until both Quince and Earl intervene, Bobby arrives in a car filled with the money, and then blows up the car, scattering the money everywhere, which leads to a massive shootout. During a standoff among Quince, Earl, Bobby and Stig, Earl reveals the CIA have 20 other secret banks, the loss of $43.125 million is only a minor setback, Stig shoots Earl, and Bobby shoots Quince, finally the duo shoot Papi outside. In the end, Bobby and Stig escape, allowing the locals to pick up the million of dollars for themselves, Bobby shoots Stig in the leg as payback for shooting him in the shoulder, they plan to take down the CIA's secret banks and sabotage their black operations, but Bobby reveals to Stig he did not blow up all the money, he has stashed some away. Also starring Patrick Fischler as Dr. Ken, Evie Thompson as Patsy, Dr. Ken's Assistant and Greg Sproles as Chief Lucas. Washington and Wahlberg are perfectly cast as the wisecracking leads, bouncing razor- sharp banter back and forth, and Olmos as the drug kingpin and Paxton being sinister are terrific bad guys, it is a botched up bank job turning into a game of cat-and-mouse with the mob, with well-paced chase sequences, explosions and all guns blazing action, but leaving enough room for a clever plot and twists, a great fun crime drama. Very good!",2 Guns
7,rmax304823,Title Says It All.,5,21 February 2015,"As nearly as I can make out the plot, it goes like this. Denzel Washington in a DEA agent secretly assigned to infiltrate a drug gang as the Texas border. Wahlberg is a Navy petty officer in Naval Intelligence assigned the task of robbing a bank of the drug gang's three million dollars, so the Navy can use it in fighting the cartels. At first, neither knows the other is working undercover. Something like that.In the event, the head of the drug gang, Edward James Olmos -- looking old and great -- is in league with the local sheriff, Bill Paxton in his best-ever performance as the smiler with a knife. Moreover, Wahlberg's boss, a Lieutenant Commander, has no intention of handing the money over to anyone except the military crooks who are his aides. Even MOREover, when the sheriff shoots Washington's chief while in pursuit of the goods, Washington, like Wahlberg, is out there all alone in the blue, riding along on a shoeshine and a smile.Paula Patton is in it too, as Washington's treacherous lover. She's a bit zoftig for me and her voice sounds like egg shells being cracked but her extraordinary features are an artist's dream.The story revolves around the logistics of ""three point one two five"" million dollars that Washington and Wahlberg steal from the Texas bank, thinking that they are working for the good guys. Everyone is either looking for it or forcing someone else to look for it.Their characters don't change, even when they twig to the fact that everybody around them, above them, and below them, is corrupt. They still carry on with the same cheerful banter. As they are waiting to be strung up by their feet and gored to death by an angry bull with cojones ""the size of coconuts"", they argue over the pronunciation of the word ""misanthrope."" The film evokes memories of all the mismatched cop movies you've ever seen, with a Tarantinoesque touch, including a Mexican standoff borrowed from ""Reservoir Dogs."" You may never have seen quite so many guns in one movie but I'm sure you've seen two men run away in slow motion from an exploding fireball before throwing themselves to the floor in front of the camera lens. There is a horde of other rechauffe stuff in there. We need not go on.",2 Guns
8,Tweekums,Solid crime action with an enjoyable twist,8,31 January 2019,"As this film opens two criminals, Robert ""Bobby"" Beans and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman, are planning to rob a bank; as part of their planning they burn down the restaurant over the road. Through flashbacks we learn that they are targeting the safety deposit boxes of Manny ""Papi"" Greco, a Mexican drug lord. They are expecting to find three million dollars but are shocked to find more... much more. That isn't their only surprise; Stig has no idea that Bobby is actually a DEA agent and Bobby has no idea that Stig is with Naval Intelligence! When each finds out they suspect the other must be corrupt to their trust breaks down... however they will have to work together if they are to survive; very powerful people want their money back and both their agencies have disowned them.This film is a lot of fun; it gets off to a really good start as we see the two 'criminals' getting ready to rob the bank and learn why they are doing it. This is quickly followed by the revelation that Bobby is DEA then later that Stig is Navy... it was a bit of a pity that the DVD box gave away this twist even though it happens early in the film. That isn't the films only twist; there are some later on which I didn't consider too long in advance. There are plenty of entertaining action set pieces; most notably the final confrontation at Papi's ranch in Mexico. The two central characters are enjoyable company with Denzel Washington was on good form as Bobby and Mark Warlberg was similarly impressive as Stig... as one would expect from a buddy-action movie their characters are somewhat chalk-and-cheese but develop a good chemistry. Edward James Olmos is good as Papi and Paula Patton impresses as Bobby's not-girlfriend Deb. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.",2 Guns
9,paul_haakonsen,Better than I had anticipated...,6,17 December 2015,"Initially you would think that something with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg is an instant hit, and this movie was actually quite alright. It was a combination of good storyline and a great cast ensemble.The storyline is fast paced and captivating. The story shifts into a high gear right away and sticks to the high gear right to the very end. The plot is easy to follow, but it captivates the audience and takes the audience along for an action-packed ride.A good storyline is only so much without a proper cast, and the cast in ""2 Guns"" really did deliver. Of course it was to be expected with names such as Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington. But with a supportive cast that includes Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos you just get a great level of talent thrown into the fray.There is a good amount of action and gunfights in the movie, which were nicely executed and put on the screen.A nice action movie with an entertaining story, but an even more impressive cast. ""2 Guns"" is well-worth watching.",2 Guns
10,michaelRokeefe,Twists and turns of corrupt rivalries.,7,26 April 2014,"Two special agents and a lot of guns are involved in this slightly humorous crime drama. Bobby Trench(Denzel Washington)is an undercover agent of the DEA, who teams up with Michael Stigman(Mark Wahlberg)to rob a bank in the hopes of busting a mob boss hiding millions of dollars in a small out of the way bank. Things get kind of complicated when Stigman, an undercover Naval Intelligence agent, shoots Bobby and takes off with the millions. By the time the two men find out each others true identities and are both working a sting against the same drug cartel; both are disavowed by their agencies and stuck in the middle of a bloody web of betrayals. Now they are forced to work together in finding out who the money really belongs to and try to make some sense of the inter-service debacle. Copious amount of violence, strong language and a bit of sexual activity; enough to keep everyone happy. Washington and Wahlberg work well together and know how to turn a laugh or two. A strong supporting cast features: Paula Patton, Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, Fred Ward, Robert John Burke, Azure Parsons and Edgar Arreola.",2 Guns
11,Scarecrow-88,2 Guns,6,5 September 2014,"""Make it rain."" If you are in the mood for a minor diversion, then ""2 Guns"" should fit the bill. Denzel is a DEA agent, Walhberg working Navy intelligence, Paula Patton and Robert John Burke DEA colleagues of Denzel, Edward James Olmos as Mexican drug-lord, James Marsden as a corrupt Navy officer, and Bill Paxton as crooked CIA agent. The cast is certainly stacked with talent, including Fred Ward, even, as a Navy Admiral who looks the other way even though Marsden is admittedly involved in corruption and Wahlberg was in the right by bringing the news to him. The plot has the MacGuffen of 42 Millionmoney of the CIA that was thought to be Olmos'. So the money is stolen from a bank by Wahlberg and Denzel but they are stunned to learn that this is not just drug cartel green. Everyone desires the money, of course, and by film's end there are a lot of people dead because of their avarice. This is a film where no one can be trusted due to the cash, but ultimately we at least have the two heroes to root due to their integrity and courage as the violence presents itself time and again in their direction. Washington is the intense part of the duo, cerebral and wise, while Wahlberg is the wise-cracking soldier with a marksman shot that doesn't miss. Patton is the wild card as her loyalties soon come into question while Marsden is that clean-cut scumbag with the wickedness that shows up despite the Navy bravado. Paxton is quite homicidal here as the CIA agent with the look of a creep duststop sheriff, who uses Russian roulette as an interrogation technique. Olmos is the sleazy drug-lord in the fancy white digs who has accumulated a robust bull ranch and marginal relationship with the US government regarding money laundering and exchange from different areas. This film has lots of guns firing ammunition, the usual speeding chases and vehicular destruction, and fun banter back and forth between the charismatic leads seeming to be having a good time. Patton is an absolute fox, Olmos is the recipient and deliverer of a beatdown by and to the leads, Marsden unveils the devil behind the handsome exterior, Paxton steals scenes as this mustachioed, silver-buckled, Cheshire-cat-grinning hunter of money that belongs to his government, and Ward's cameo tells you all you need to know about certain amoral authority figures with little regard for the truth when it comes to the proper image of the Navy (or any military/government institution). Wahlberg's all tongue-in-cheek, bubble-gum chewing, and matching barbs with Washington who has now developed the effortless ease that films like ""2 Guns"" benefit from thanks to his immense star power. All that money going up in a cloud of exploding Impala is a hoot as the bullets fly.",2 Guns
12,LeonLouisRicci,Every Gun Misfires,5,18 December 2013,"Mark Wahlberg may not be the most undeserving A-List Movie Star but He's a contender. The Guy tends to mumble and when the speech pattern accelerates its amazing the other Actors in the Scene can actually understand what He is saying. Oh, but They have read the Script.This is an Action/Comedy, yea another one. The opening Scene in the Diner and the ""set the stage"" banter about pancakes and eggs is just not funny and its meant to be big time. Its the tone of the Movie. The Chemistry between Mark and Denzel seems forced, prefab, etc. It's not awful but it hardly works.This whole thing is paycheck Time and there is nothing wrong with a paycheck in Today's job market, but these Stars and the Big-Budget and the Writer and the Director, barely put in a hard days work. It is lazy and everyone involved here got overpaid.The Movie is semi-entertaining but so bland and belabored that it really should be ashamed. Try just a little bit to be witty, or wild. This is cut and paste, cute and cuddly, mediocre, and the 2 Guns, in fact the whole arsenal in this Movie's foot locker misfires.",2 Guns
13,zardoz-13,"An Entertain,, Above-Average Crime Comedy with Denzel and Wahlberg",8,11 August 2013,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make a charismatic couple of wisecracking rogues in ""Contraband"" director Baltasar Kormákur's action comedy ""2 Guns"" with Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos as their adversaries. Comparably, ""2 Guns"" qualifies as a lightweight version of Oliver Stone's superb narcotics opus ""Savages."" Nevertheless, ""2 Guns"" shuns the gratuitous blood, gore, and mutations that made Stone's film a chore to watch. In Kormákur's film, Washington and Wahlberg are working undercover to take down a notorious Mexican cartel chieftain. Initially, neither knows the other is a government agent. Inexplicably, when the bottom falls out from under them, our heroes find themselves caught in a cross-fire from their own treacherous colleagues as well as the villains.In the 2012 movie ""Savages,"" a corrupt DEA official (John Travolta) paved the way for the Mexican cartel to gain a foothold in California. In ""2 Guns,"" our heroes abide by orders that corrupt government officials have given so the cartels can safely distribute their product in the U.S. without fear of confiscation. Cast as a squeaky clean DEA agent, Denzel has toiled long and hard to infiltrate a major cartel so he can bust a major international crime czar. Unfortunately, he encounters an enemy infinitely more dangerous than the cartels. The premise that the cartels couldn't flourish without CIA intervention is provocative. Mind you, this isn't the first time either a television show or a movie has depicted spooks in cahoots with the murderous Mexican mafia. Indeed, as far back as ""Miami Vice"" in the late 1980s, rogue CIA agents were importing narcotics from Southeast Asia. Recently, ""Person of Interest"" has appropriated similar story lines involving corrupt CIA officials in the illegal drug trade. Meantime, Kormákur and ""Law & Order: L.A."" writer Blake Masters have done a splendid job with their adaptation of Steven Grant's graphic novel. Grant implicated dirty government officials in the narcotics trade, but he didn't take it to the extent Kormákur does in ""2 Guns."" This exciting but formulaic shoot'em up ripples with surprises galore during its lean, mean, 109-minutes. When our heroes aren't swapping lead with the opposition, they swap witticisms with themselves. They cavort together like Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise but with considerably less pyrotechnics.Robert 'Bobby' Trench (Denzel Washington of ""Unstoppable"") and Michael 'Stig' Stigman (Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed"") hold up a nothing bank in a nowhere town named Tres Cruces. Surprising the local constabulary, our duo locks them up in their own cells along with their own prisoners. Afterward, our heroes don Halloween masks and hold up the bank. Rather than go for the drawers at each teller's cage, they bypass them to rifle the safe deposit boxes. Bobby and Stig had figured that they would find a cool $3 or $4 million in Mexican drug cartel revenue in the bank. They wind up stealing more than $43 million during their short robbery. At the payoff and split-up point, after they have counted their loot, Stig double-crosses Bobby, shoots him, and then learns to his chagrin that Bobby works for the DEA. Bobby complains about this revelation to his superior officer, Quince (James Marsden of ""X-Men""), after he hands over the bundle of booty. Before he realizes it, Stig's own people are blasting away at him and listing him as AWOL. It doesn't help matters that Stig assaulted another Navy official. Meantime, Bobby begins to have his doubts about his own people after a group of CIA agents led by Earl (Bill Paxton of ""Twister"") show up and shoot his topmost superior and frame him for his murder. Along the way, Mexican cartel chieftain Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos of ""Miami Vice"") gets so angry with our heroes that he ties them up and lets his prize bull charge them with lowered horns. Miraculously, Bobby and Stig leave Papi's premises in one piece, but not before the villain abducts Bobby's former girlfriend, Deb (Paula Patton of ""Precious""), and threatens to ice her if they don't cough up the loot.""2 Guns"" boasts an adequate number of gunfights, careening car chases, and tough guy banter to make the grade as an above-average comic thriller like the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies. Our heroes never seem to ever completely steer clear of trouble. Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg look like they had blast making this shoot'em up. The supporting cast is sturdy, with James Marsden distinguishing himself as more of an adversary than Edward James Olmos. Despite his brief appearance in ""2 Guns,"" Robert John Burke of ""Safe"" and ""RoboCop 3"" makes a definite impression as Denzel's superior. Kormákur stages several slick looking shoot-outs with our heroes standing back to back against the bad guys. Mind you, Kormákur's shoot-outs are not as gory as Stone's firefights in ""Savages"" or John Woo's bullet ballads in ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled."" Animal rights activists will probably complain about the scene where chickens have been buried up to their beaks in the dirt for target practice. The last time that I saw anything as cruel as this was in the cult Sam Peckinpah western ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" with James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson. Happily, ""2 Guns"" never wears out its welcome, and Kormákur gives it a different enough vibe to set it apart from the typical action comedy.",2 Guns
14,neil-476,Enjoyable action comedy,8,23 August 2013,"Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) are trying to buy cocaine from drug dealer Papy (Edward James Olmos). Except they are both undercover (Bobby is DEA, Stig is Naval Intelligence) and neither knows the other is not a crook. And then they carry out a bank robbery and end up, Charley Varrick style, with a great deal more cash than they expected. And then it gets REALLY complicated, with the two of them, the drug cartel, DEA, Naval Intelligence, and the CIA all pursuing the money and each other.This action comedy thriller is great fun. It isn't that original, but that doesn't matter. The story works, the cast all do well (a special commendation to Paula Patton for getting them out for the boys), and there is an easy chemistry between the two principles. Washington is, perhaps, coasting a little, but Wahlberg works hard for laughs. He is one of the most improved actors in the industry.",2 Guns
15,ferguson-6,Are you my Buddy?,4,3 August 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. The bar has been set with buddy flicks that mix comedy and action ... Lethal Weapon and 48 Hours. The vast majority, including this one, fall short even while blatantly copying many elements from those classics. Guns blazing, rapid-fire repartee and huge explosions are requirements in this genre, as is an on screen bond between the two leads.The good news is that instead of the original (tired) pairing of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, we get Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Denzel plays the straight man role just fine, but Wahlberg is way over the top. He is in his typical strained-too loud-frenzied talking mode that just comes across as trying too hard. Instead of a truckin' t-shirt, he should have worn one that said 'kiss me I'm cute and funny'.For some reason, most of these movies make the mistake of not providing a fully developed and menacing villain. Somehow the script manages to waste the great Edward James Olmos as a drug lord. He does what he can with what he's given, but it's frustrating to see him become the punchline of lame joke. Bill Paxton seems to be the only one who was given much to work with in the script and he chews the scenery every chance he gets. We also get a quick scene with Fred Ward and I think we would all rather have more from him here and less from the generic James Marsden. Of course, all of these movies require the presence of a female and in this case we get Paula Patton, who not only suffers through horrific dialogue, but also some absurd gratuitous nudity.As you might guess from the trailer, corruption and double-crosses abound, and the Denzel/Wahlberg duo produces a few sparks, but this script based on the Boom! graphic novel just doesn't hold up for a feature length movie. Icelandic director Baltasar Kurmakur, whose previous outing was the ultra-serious action drama Contraband (also with Wahlberg) falls victim to the weak dialogue and inconsistent villainy.",2 Guns
16,anaconda-40658,Too Many Guns.,6,19 August 2015,"2 Guns (2013): Dir: Baltasar Kormakur / Cast: Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg, Paula Patton, Bill Paxton, James Marsden: Standard action film with a title that references teamwork. Denzel Washington is an undercover DEA agent and Mark Wahlberg plays a Naval officer and both are unaware of the status of the other. They are arrested at customs with Washington informing that the drug lord he was trying to convict paid in cash as oppose to cocaine so that he could arrest him. Wahlberg suggests a bank robbery to grab three million that is placed there by the drug lord. The robbery goes forth without any go-ahead from headquarters and the three million turns into over forty million. All hell breaks loose and Washington ends up with a flesh wound and Wahlberg has the Naval guys unloading bullets out of every weapon in their possession to kill him. Obviously Washington and Wahlberg must work together to survive three enemy forces in a pointlessly violent climax. Director Baltasar Kormakur pulls off some effective action footage, which is in the same vein as his Contraband. Washington and Wahlberg pull through the carnage with appeal and sarcasm, and Paula Patton makes a decent intrigue as Washington's lover who may or may not be whom she claims on the police force. The villains are hopelessly cardboard with Naval bad boys, Mexican drug lords, and Bill Paxton wanting his money back in an opportunity to present more brutality. James Marsden even shows up as a Lieutenant Commander on the hunt. Two guns, too violent, too much unless you are an action fan. Score: 6 ½ / 10",2 Guns
17,FlashCallahan,A wink too many.....,7,24 December 2013,"Trench, an undercover DEA agent, takes advantage of gunman Stigman's idea to rob a bank. But it proves too successful with more money seized than imagined with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be Naval Intelligence, and shoots Trench, and takes the money. This then finds Trench and Stigman in a web of corrupt rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the pair must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.....Remember back in the eighties when buddy cop movies used to be the biggest action movie draw this side of 'Die Hard in a......'. Lethal Weapon paved the path, and was followed by the like of Red Heat and Tango and Cash.Then all of a sudden, the movies for poorer and poorer, and they eventually stopped.This tries to retread this path with an impressive cast, but very little that we haven't seen before. Washington can do this stuff in his sleep, and here he goes back to Virtuosity territory, just to get a good pay packet. Wahlberg plays the slightly sillier one, which means in Hollywood he gets all the best lines and gets in the most trouble.It looks really good, the director has definitely seen too many Tony Scott movies, and it's entertaining enough, just not original enough to be anything other than average.And Washington rarely makes average movies.",2 Guns

It works primarily of the unexpectedly fine screen chemistry between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent who takes advantage of gunman Michael Stigman's (Mark Wahlberg) idea to rob a bank to bust him and a mob boss (Edward James Olmos). However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than predicted and with Trench's forces failing to halt the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves. The well-healed cast of characters (at times difficult to tell who is on what team) includes Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Fred Ward, Robert John Burke, Greg Sproles, and Paula Patton.It is noisy action all the way but the script is peppered with enough solid humor and exceptional banter between Washington and Wahlberg that it keeps our attention to the very odd ending.

19,siderite,Gun buddy film that I found completely ordinary,7,25 November 2013,"I was recommended this as a no bullshit film. Well, it wasn't a bullshit film, but it wasn't a very good one either. Or perhaps I am just automatically annoyed by movies about people killing and double crossing each other on a joyful American country music soundtrack. It just feels fake.The cast is pretty good. I like Mark Wahlberg and there was a time when I liked Denzel Washington as well. Bill Paxton used to be one of my favourites as well, while the likes of James Mardsen, Fred Ward and Edward James Olmos complete the cast. However, except some bad boy posturing by Paxton and Olmos, the film is almost entirely Wahlberg and Washington. That lead me to high expectations which, unfortunately, were not met. They do a decent job with the script they have, but the story is just another heist deal with a bunch of people following and shooting each other over money.The twists were pretty predictable, the action scenes were too over the top, while the incessant dialogue that was supposed to be funny was mostly annoying. My conclusion: average at best, but hey, friends of mine liked it.",2 Guns

That's typical of any action film and with two heavyweights like Mark and Denzel staring and a little sugar and spice from Paula Patton this film is one to remember. It's as if no one is who they seem the plot is with suspense and many twist. As Washington is an undercover DEA agent and along the way of his investigation of a drug cartel he crosses paths with an eager and rebel Navy information officer(Wahlberg)and both have their own little agenda a con game that will benefit both. They don't trust one another yet along the way the twist of undercover law with the turn of blackmail leads to money in the end. A nice eye candy view is Denzel's girlfriend Deb(the hot and sexy Paula Patton)and the scene of Paula in a hot sexy purple bra is a fine eye treat!

22,KineticSeoul,Generic and forgettable buddy cop movie,6,17 December 2013,"When it comes down to it, this becomes a somewhat generic and forgettable buddy cop movie. With whole different plot lines mashed into one. It felt like watching a buddy cop movie version of the movie ""Safe"" 2012, except not as entertaining. The main selling point of this flick is the fact that it has Denzel Washington in it, although Wahlberg did well. The chemistry between the two is alright, but just didn't seem to stand out when it came to the two characters. The plot is about double crosses and corruption in military, DEA with the drug cartel thrown into the mix. This flick is fast paced but it isn't really invigorating or all that thrilling to watch. Despite the overly far-fetched plot direction. Overall, it's a passable way to pass the time, but when it comes down to it. It's a generic and forgettable buddy cop movie.

23,Hellmant,Washington and Wahlberg make a good team.,7,23 August 2013,"'2 GUNS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Superstars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg team up for this buddy action comedy film based on the graphic novel of the same name (by Steven Grant). The film was written by Blake Masters (a TV writer of shows like 'LAW & ORDER: LA' and 'BROTHERHOOD') and directed by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (who also directed Wahlberg in the 2012 action film 'CONTRABAND'). Washington and Wahlberg play undercover agents (one DEA and the other a Naval Intelligence Officer) who unwittingly steal tens of millions of dollars from dangerous men while robbing a bank in an attempt to dismantle a drug cartel. The film is routine buddy movie fare but the two stars shine.Washington stars as 'Bobby' Trench and Wahlberg as 'Stig' Stigman. Trench is an undercover DEA agent and Stig is an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer. Each thinks the other is just a common crook and the two are planning to rob a bank together, in hopes of seizing a drug cartel's money ($3 million worth). When they pull off the crime they unwittingly come across $43 million in the bank and they soon learn it belongs to someone much more powerful than the drug dealers they thought they were stealing from. Things become a deadly mess as they also learn each other's true identity.The film co-stars Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Edward James Olmos, Fred Ward, Robert John Burke and the beautiful Paula Patton. The story is pretty routine and the action is nothing too spectacular but it is funny and Washington and Wahlberg do make a good team (they have some terrific banter together). Wahlberg has made a career out of doing buddy films (including spoofs like 'THE OTHER GUYS') so this is fitting for him but Washington is too good of an actor for movies like this. He does tend to do dumb action films a lot just for the payday it seems though. He has done worse films and like I said he and Wahlberg do make a good comic duo. So despite it's genericness it is an entertaining action film, especially if you're a fan of either of the actors (and more especially both).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlUvgTS58bk",2 Guns

26,Robert_duder,"A solid action flick, no more and no less",8,11 August 2013,"I thought it strange that I had hardly heard of this film at all. Two big stars, a recipe for a summer blockbuster but I heard nothing about it until it opened. For lack of anything else playing I decided to give it a shot. I knew it would be entertaining and it absolutely was!! Its a fun, shoot em up, gangster flick with a tad bit of a modern western feel to it at times. Its a complex web of political enemies and back stabbings with just a dash of dark humour. Is there anything the film doesn't have? Its a heist movie, car chases, gun fights, hand to hand combat, comedy, gangsters, dusty small towns...it really is the sort of film that will likely find even more footing on video years from now. I don't think the marketing was great on the film but perhaps they thought the two stars would carry the film enough. I think that the film does drag just a little bit and perhaps runs a little longer than necessary but there is very little wrong with the film. It is incredibly entertaining and works on a lot of levels. Its not a brilliant film and doesn't have a ton of depth but it absolutely works for the action fans and fans of either star.Mark Wahlberg has just about solidified his position as one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. He is a versatile actor and his sarcastic, lovable personality almost always works on screen. In 2 Guns he gets the opportunity to play a sarcastic, slightly brainless crook and then flip it over to this bad-ass Naval intelligence officer. Wahlberg is what Wahlberg does best and if you're a fan of his you'll enjoy the film. Its been awhile since I've seen Denzel Washington in a mainstream flick like this. I like him a lot but for the last few years I felt like his ego was really getting in the way of his performances but this role for him really worked. Maybe it was because his character was egotistical so I didn't find him quite so overbearing. Or perhaps it was the pairing of him with Wahlberg that helped keep both egos in check. The two of them together were very good. I wouldn't say they were excellent but definitely great. The film has a myriad of villains and all the villains are sort of campy, old school ""western"" villains. Bill Paxton is deliciously campy as the angry, violent CIA agent out for blood and his money. He is over the top but not so much that he comes across as a joke. Edward James Olmos is perfectly stereotypical as the drug dealing head of a Mexican gangster family. He is very cookie cutter and we've seen it a hundred times but who cares because he was fun and violent and well fit in the role. James Marsden jumps out of his comfort zone to play a corrupt Naval officer. Marsden is good but I felt like he was too far from his comfort zone and didn't quite match how great the villains played by Olmos and Paxton. Perhaps three is a crowd when it comes to villains. Fred Ward deserves honourable mention for his small cameo role that was intense and well played. And finally we have the obligatory lady of the film played by Paula Patton. She did alright. Once again I'm not sure she was entirely necessary which seems to be so often the case with female roles in action flicks. Did we need the romance? Did we need the blatant nudity? She was there and her character was okay...that's the best I can say.Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur had a hit on his hands with Contraband and now this one is doing well. I don't think he's your typical mainstream action director. He absolutely has style and a film like this proves that. The best thing about this movie is how it felt like a stylized modern day Western. You could almost take this story and sub in an old school western cast and town and had a great western flicks. Absolutely a fun time at the movies and a worthy film in the action genre. 8/10",2 Guns
27,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Flat, unexciting drivel that wastes the pairing of two great leads",4,20 August 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRobert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are two buddies who arrange it to rob a bank where some of the world's deadliest criminals hold accounts. But these two friends hide a common secret from each other: they are both undercover agents in their respective fields, one for the DEA, the other for a branch of the military. The seeds of mistrust are planted when both learns each other's troublesome secret, but they must both overcome this when they learn they are now both in hot pursuit by a ruthless drug lord, and some corrupt CIA agents and military officials who want the stolen money back.The 'buddy buddy' formula has remained an effective gambit by Hollywood ever since Richard Donner started the craze back in the late 80's with Lethal Weapon, even when it seems like it's aware itself of what a tired and predictable idea it's become. This is the least of the problems with 2 Guns, though, a thoroughly messy, disappointing affair that wastes a screen pairing with huge potential in the shape of Washington and Wahlberg, an older and wiser/younger and more hot headed pairing that could have worked great with better writing and more taut direction. As it is, it barely gets out of first gear.The film is driven by a confused, incoherent plot that my plot summary barely managed to cover, that is more illogical and uninvolving the more it goes on. The film feels the need to compound it's problems by billing itself as a big, dumb, testosterone fueled action film, but delivering surprisingly little action, with a series of long, boring stretches in between the decent but rarely electrifying action set pieces. Chemistry wise, Washington and Wahlberg are hardly a none event, but with the meandering, redundant script, they may as well have been. It's just sad to think how much more might have been if they'd set their sights a bit higher and maybe demanding some screenplay changes.Baltasur Kormakur's previous Mark Wahlberg offering Contraband was totally forgettable, but just about serviceable. 2 Guns only manages to make it by by the smallest thread, one notch away from awful but very barely average. **",2 Guns
28,bowmanblue,2 Guns - no nonsense,8,14 August 2014,"Yes, there have been cops and robbers movies. Yes, there have been 'buddy-cop' movies and yes, there have been a tonne of movies where the protagonists fall foul of the mob and end up 'owing them big-time.' However, very few of those manage to pull of those generic plot lines off in one movie (and, more amazing still, make it work).2 Guns is nothing original, but it is fast-paced, slick, stylish and, best of all, entertaining. This is probably down to the two leads - the ever-reliable Denzel Washington and the mainly-reliable Mark Wahlberg. Perhaps without these two heading the bill, the film would have been as sub-standard as the plot suggests. The two actors play off each other brilliantly and save every scene from ever slipping into mediocrity. There's a real 'Pulp Fiction' vibe between them with all the banter and general chit-chat which helps establish their characters.There are plenty of good performances from the supporting cast, too. The long forgotten Bill Paxton (still best known for 'Hudson' in Aliens) is great as the villain.Basically, if you like cops and robbers, crime, gangsters, or just generally action movies, you can't go far wrong with this one.

29,g-bodyl,Very Entertaining!,9,10 November 2014,"What happens when you combine the starpower of Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington? You get a fantastic, action-packed bonanza called 2 Guns. This film hearkens back to the 1980's where these kind of films were made constantly and this film does a good job in bringing back memories. I loved the violent, over-the-top action and I also loved the comedic interplay between the two stars. All of that combined made this movie a fun ride.This film has kind of a unique concept. What if two men were paired with each other and both did not know that their partners were undercover cops? Well that was the case for Robert Trench and Michael Stigman. After a drug bust on a drug lord named Greco goes wrong, the two men go on the run where they ultimately must learn to trust each other.The acting isn't too bad after all. Denzel's career has been more ""fun"" as of late and he does a good job here. He even makes Mark Wahlberg a better actor with his presence. The witty interplay between the two is worth the price of admission alone. 80's favorite Bill Paxton does a great job as the CIA man who no one wants to mess with.Overall, 2 Guns is an action-packed, explosives-filled film. It doesn't offer anything new, but what it does is promise a really fun time. The script may not be the best, but Denzel and Marky Mark do what they can to make a serviceable film. I had a blast watching the film and it's nice to see Denzel have a fun time for once. I rate this film 9/10.",2 Guns
30,lesleyharris30,"Nothing Inspiring or Genius, but Washington and Wahlberg Make a Terrific Duo,",8,9 December 2013,"2 Guns is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's an enjoyable film with a unique and complicated story that see's two men working for different organisations getting tnemselves in to huge trouble after meeting with a drug lord, it keeps you at the edge of your seat with its terrific action and can also have you in stitches laughing on several occasions. My problem with the storyline is that it can be confusing at times, they don't spoon feed their audience enough, there were certain scenes where the two main characters are doing something, and I had no idea why they were doing it, their motives could have been clearer. The cast is all around fantastic, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg both shine in the lead roles and the chemistry between them is the highlight of the entire movie, they are also joined by an impressive supporting cast that includes Paula Patton, Bill Paxton and James Marsden. Exciting, funny and action packed, 2 Guns is worth the watch if you're looking for a good action or crime film. Two men, a DEA agent and a naval officer, work together to take down a major drug dealing business, both unaware that the other is undercover. Best Performance: Denzel Washington",2 Guns

Sometimes movies have twist after twist and it gets jumbled and begins to become comical to the point of almost ruining the movie. While this one did have many twists in it it never felt jumbled.

Paula Patton's got the hots I agree, but she should just stop. Wrecking havoc in all the films she does (remember MI: Ghost Protocol). Even the two main lead players disappointed me; Denzel Washington with his pretentious swag and Mark Wahlberg with his jaw & eyes doing what doesn't suit him at all. They don't put any faith to the characters they play. It felt like a blunder inside a blunder when even the actors acted like they are not sure who they are. Terrible!CIA snatching a percent off cartels? Okay. DEA sending covert ops? Okay. In an effort to bring to the people something they haven't heard of is a good conception idea, but borrowing clichés and adding cheap-jack humor to it is what steals the bullets of these ill-mannered guns. Dumb drug dealers? Check. The only female character who acts out of her script is the highlight facet of this rather contriving B-word they use often in such films.Gun slinging, unfair Russian roulette, bare breasts, explosions and sleazy money are if you are looking for, you may very well wait for a TV premiere.

34,The-Sarkologist,Enter the Grey Area,7,6 May 2017,"Well, I guess you could consider this to be a buddy cop movie, but also one of those movies where the main characters are crooks – sort of. Well, at first you think they are, namely because they are sitting in a diner talking about robbing a bank that happens to be across the road, and also making a comment that one should never rob a bank that happens to be across the road from a really good donut shop (so they proceed to blow the donut shop up). Well, it quickly becomes apparent that these two guys aren't actually crooks, but rather one of them happens to be a DEA agent and the other happens to be Naval Intelligence, it is just that neither know who the other actually is. As for the bank – well, it happens to be the safe deposit for a drug dealer.Actually, this happens to be one of those films where not everything is actually as it seems. As I mentioned the two main characters at first appear to be crooks, but then turn out to actually be the good guys, though one sort of wanders whether there is any such thing as a good guy or a bad guy in a world that is becoming ever more grey. As for the money, well, I really don't want to give too much away because as I indicated, not everything is as it seems, though you do sort of wonder whether it is actually feasible for a member of naval intelligence and a DEA agent to actually rob a bank. Then again, one also wonders whether it is actually right for the intelligence services to extort criminal organisations out of money so as not to bust them.This was a rather fun film, though also pretty gritty as well, and in a way it seems to be the direction a lot of films have been heading for the last twenty-five years. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, other than Islamic terrorists (which I have to admit are pretty boring when it comes down to it), there hasn't been a decent external bad guy to constantly throw our heroes at, so all of the sudden the government, or even rogue elements within the government, suddenly become the baddies. A part of me was thinking that maybe this had something to do with Hollywood's left leaning elements – because Hollywood, which happens to be a union town, has always seem to drift to the left, at least socially (how many unmarried couples are there in Hollywood movies that have waited til they got married to have sex?). However, the idea of the government being the bad guy is a very libertarian concept.Another thing that seems to jump out of this film is how our heroes have turned out to be loners of late – in a sense the guys that they thought they could rely upon are no longer reliable. In one sense we have their allies getting shot, or otherwise they simply are betrayed and left hung out to dry. However I guess the admiral was partially right when he pointed out that naval officers do not rob banks, and if they are ordered to do so by a superior officer then they probably should start questioning the integrity of that officer. In the end there is following orders, and there is following orders, and as the Nazi's found out, there actually is no defense when it comes to following orders.So, in the end, I didn't mind this film at all. It is fun, and if you like those gritty cops dramas where there are a multitude of twists and turns, then you would probably enjoy this one. While I wouldn't go as far as calling it a 'hidden gem', it is fun and worth wasting a couple of hours to watch.",2 Guns

38,eddie_baggins,A fun ride thanks to the on form leads,6,3 June 2014,"No matter how good a script or how interesting a story, a movies worth normally settles upon the chemistry of the films two leads or the charisma of a solo participant if a movie so desires. Icelandic born director Kormakur action/comedy based upon Steven Grant's graphic novel's is a pretty generic and overcomplicated story that becomes something more thanks to the charms and chemistry between his two leads Denzel Washington as stoic DEA agent Bobby and Mark Wahlberg as loud mouth Ex-Navy member Stig.Generating a banter and interplay not unlike Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the once great Lethal Weapon series Washington and Wahlberg produce a buddy partnership that seems effortless and plays out in a natural unforced manner. Clearly having a blast acting alongside each other the two leads plough through material and dialogue that should not be near as funny as it is but with Washington doing his usual thing and Wahlberg again on a Pain and Gain type mode everything seems fresher and tolerable than it at times ought to. Other actors in the piece have fun with their roles with Bill Paxton on pretty decent Justified-lite form with his turn as bad boy Earl eerily reminiscent of an aging Raylan Givens. It's a lifesaver that these actors produced such fun turns for without them the film could have become another 2013 action flick that faltered badly ala White House Down or A Good Day to Die Hard.Kormakur showed a decent flare in the action genre with his Wahlberg starring Contraband showing enough to suggest he had a bright future in the genre. This flare Kormakur showed with that previous film is sadly lacking here in 2 Guns with the action scenes never thrilling or never in any way original. It's a shame these scenes falter as they do for the story which should be a ripping yarn is only made into half of what it could have been thanks to some clunky exposition and far too many balls being juggled at one time.2 Guns is a fun, fast and as per expected forgettable movie that goes beyond its means thanks to the work of two professional actors who clearly share a chemistry that can be utilised in future projects including perhaps a sequel to this venture which could look to include action and a story that is as good as it's leading men.3 sticks of chewing gum out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",2 Guns

The character were good and t hen chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington was good, but there was just way to much going on. The action was OK and some of the scenes were quite funny, but if you take your eyes off the screen for 5 minutes, your going to loose the plot.

Watchable!Round-Up: It's good to see Denzel Washington to comedy, in his usual cool way, and both actors really seemed like they had fun making this movie. It's full of corruption, action and a few witty jokes, but it just goes from one instance to another which made it over complicated. Apart from that, it's a typical buddy comedy with 2 actors who are at the peak of there careers.

Slowly we find out that Denzel is actually a Drug Enforcement officer and Mark Wahlberg is a navy special operations soldier.Denzel has a love interest in Paula Patton as Debbie, who comes in and out of the films storyline. What I liked about the film is the two main characters Bobby and Stig were being chased by three different groups of bad guys who wanted the loot. The first group of bad guys was led by Bill Paxton, as Earl, a maniacal interrogator who represents the CIA and owner of the money that was taken by Bobby and Stig in the bank robbery, The second group of bad guys is led by the great character actor James Edward Olmos (Best known for the 70's TV series Miami Vice) as Papi Greco a drug trafficking Mexican kingpin. The third group of bad guys is led by James Marsden who plays Quince a Navy sergeant who is the first to abscond the bankroll but quickly loses the money's where about.So you would think that with three groups of bad guys chasing Bobby and Stig the audience would see lots of actions and an interesting plot.

I found the action scenes to be way over the top Hollywood and I suggest that the film could have saved 50% of the films budget had they just animated the action scenes because they were so phony. A quick summary shows sure shot Stig (Mark Wahlberg) always hitting his target the first time, and the shooters never hitting their targets, namely Stig and Bobby. There is one scene where James Edward Olmos hangs Stig and Bobby upside down and he then takes a baseball bat to their rib cages a dozen times or so. An hour later they are shown walking away without a bruise or a limp as evidence of their beating by the Mexican drug lord James Edward Olmos.It is a decent time waster, but it probably would not be a film I would pop back in to my Blu Ray player to watch a second time. I give it a 5 out of 10 rating.",2 Guns
41,southdavid,Stig Larcen-y,5,18 October 2021,"The nomenclature of the film made it the first one alphabetically on Sky Movies that I hadn't already seen, so this weekend I decided to give it a try. An adaptation of a graphic novel, the chemistry between the two leads is solid, but there's little else to recommend about the film.Two capable but low-level criminals, Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) are cheated by a Mexican crime boss, Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). In revenge they plan to rob a bank and steal his cash reserves from there. Unfortunately, Greco is not the only party that keep money stored at this particular branch and soon a much more dangerous and organised foe is on their tail.Any film with this pairing as it's leads is off to a good start and, though occasionally their banter feels a little forced, generally their chemistry is really good and they are likable characters. There's a few more reliable actors around the film, Olmos of course, Paula Patton as the love interest, James Marsden and Fred Ward as Navy Officers, but if someone comes close to stealing the film it's Bill Paxton, who's all implied threat via a veneer of geniality as he confidently threatens everyone else to get his money back.Away from its actors though, it's just not an interesting or unique enough film to make it worth your while. Its story isn't particularly clever or surprising, the action scenes are . . . Alright, but again, nothing that lives in the memory once the credits have rolled. Indeed it's a much better cast that than film actually deserves, as there a dozens of similar, cheap actions films released every year.Hard to generate too much feeling about the film, either one way or the other, but that it struggled to hold my attention for the run time makes it tough to recommend.",2 Guns

Two undercover agents, one a DEA agent (Denzel Washington), another a Navy SEAL (Mark Wahlberg), yet the two don't have a clue about each other. Naturally at one point or another the cat is out of the bag, thinks turn sour and hijinks ensue. The rest of the movie is really nothing more than one action scene after another, tied together with some witty dialogue and posing with guns.Yeah it's not very original or inventive, but I thought I got my money's worth. The action scenes are done with a great amount of flair and the whole setting, while outlandish, doesn't seem contrived or silly, as these kinds of plots often do. But the biggest reason for my entertainment were the two main actors. Washington and Wahlberg work well together and their frustrated conversations, as they both find the truth about one another, are a good deal of fun.It's a bit shame that the story couldn't have been more clever, because these two could have pulled it off. Now it's your basic shoot-em-up with a paper think excuse to have the entire world hunt these two in order to shoot them full of holes.

46,estebangonzalez10,Washington and Wahlberg are the film's 2 Guns,6,12 November 2013,"""No one expected it! You should have seen your face!""Yes, we pretty much expected everything that was going to happen in this formulaic old-school buddy cop action comedy, but it was fun to see these two charismatic and talented actors interact with one another. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and Mark Wahlberg is also incredibly likable and funny. They make this otherwise predictable and generic film entertaining. It kind of pays homage to those 90 action thrillers like Lethal Weapon or Bad Boys where you have several plot twists going on but the success of the film completely relied on the two lead characters and the way they played off each other. 2 Guns might suffer from a script that was written for a straight to DVD film, but Washington and Wahlberg elevate the material to a higher level. This is the second time that Wahlberg works with Icelandic director, Baltasar Kormakur, after last year's Contraband. In 2 Guns Wahlberg has a much lighter role, and he has several funny scenes, and it completely works considering the script is way too weak to take itself seriously. 2 Guns was an entertaining film, but it was way too formulaic to stand out. It is an OK film for a one time viewing, but just don't go into it expecting it to be mind blowing, because it's just a ridiculously fun film.Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent trying to bring down the leader of a Mexican drug cartel known as Papi (Edward James Olmos). Michael Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) is a Naval Intelligence agent who is also trying to get to Papi's money to bring down his cartel. Robert and Stig team up without knowing that either one of them is really working undercover. Stig convinces Robert to rob a small local bank where Papi keeps his money. The heist is far more successful than they had anticipated and they soon discover that they have both been framed. This was never Papi's money and now they have all sort of government officials after them along with the cartel. They will have to learn to trust each other if they want to survive. Bill Paxton plays a supporting role as one of the government officials who is after the money, while Paula Patton plays Robert's love interest.Washington and Wahlberg were great together and they are probably the film's biggest asset. I do have to admit that I enjoyed Bill Paxton's performance here. He was probably the lone secondary character that actually worked. James Marsden was completely miscast. As the title suggests, the film really relies on the two guns: Washington and Wahlberg. If you like these actors then you will probably enjoy this film, if you don't then forget about it. The film also suffers from a weaker second half, but at least it's fast paced and keeps you entertained. It's mindless fun. I can't think of a Denzel Washington film I haven't liked. He never disappoints.",2 Guns
47,jimbo-53-186511,"It has its good parts, but overall it's a mediocre product",5,8 February 2014,"I knew from the start from the premise that this was not going to be an original film, but I knew that in order for this film to work that there would need to be chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg and that for me is where the film really slammed the anchors on. One thing I will say is that whilst the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington wasn't brilliant, that at least Wahlberg was less annoying than the character that he portrayed in the Other Guys and the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington was much better than that which was portrayed between Wahlberg and Ferrell in the Other Guys. The first 20-30 minutes of the film were great, the characters were established fairly well. The problem that I had is that the film descended into mediocrity, there was nothing to make me care about anything that had happened. Wahlberg and Washington were OK in their roles and I thought that they were right to cast Wahlberg as the 'hot head' and Washington as the 'calm and rational' one. I personally don't think it would not have worked the other way round. The problem is that the audience weren't really given any reason to care for their characters. Going back to character chemistry, this is another issue with this film in that Wahlberg and Washington don't share particularly good on screen chemistry and if we are honest with ourselves we've seen much better from the likes of (Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon and Chan and Tucker from Rush Hour). The chemistry was there at the beginning, but then it just seemed to disappear. It didn't help that the story itself wasn't particularly engaging or involving. I wasn't bothered about it being unoriginal (let's be honest there are 1000's of films that have been made so it's difficult to come up with an entirely new idea). However, the film was never that exciting, funny or suspenseful - it managed to have very small amounts of each of these elements and that to me is why it is merely a mediocre product.I also felt that the way that Stig's discovery of Bobby being a DEA agent was also quite poorly handled and seemed to me to be an example of lazy writing. In summary, the film started off well and there were funny moments (one example was the scene with Bobby, Stig and the bull), but overall it never really held my interest.

50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Alright,6,8 April 2017,"2 Guns is breezy, slight, casually R rated popcorn fun, with a script that tries so hard to churn out quirky hysterics that it often stumbles on itself, rambles and at times is plain weird, but it's all good because when it's fun, it's great fun. Denzel and Marky Mark are trying on the buddy banter for size here, and they're both pretty serviceable at it, plus have decent chemistry, they're just a bit too relaxed at times it seems. Like, what person would *still* be making wisecracks when they are literally inches away from certain death at the horns of a stampeding bull? It's no matter though, for such things are the hallmark of action comedies, and the fluff does get balanced out by the R rating, which is nice to see and not to be taken for granted these days. The plot is all over the place and mainly acts as a playground of sorts for them to prance around in and get on each other's nerves, as well as that of multiple varied and colourful antagonists. The both of them are undercover law enforcement, Denzel a DEA hotshot and Marky an NCIS type dude, or maybe it's the other way around, I cent really remember. Anywho, they get involved in everyone from a crusty Mexican mafioso (Edward James Olmos) to a corrupt ex CIA agent played by a wild eyed Bill Paxton, in top sadistic form. There's also Denzel's luscious colleague (Paula Parton), his shark of a boss (Robert John Burke), and a few shady Navy pricks (Fred Ward and James Marsden) all thrown together in a messy, lovable piñata of a plot line that doesn't take itself too seriously, but rather ambles along to match the cavalier pace and attitude of every character in the film. The only player who conveys actual potent menace or rises above the leisurely cadence is Paxton, whose villain is pretty darn terrifying, especially when he breaks out his own patented and much more effective method of playing Russian roulette. Wahlberg and Washington are clearly having fun and they're quite enjoyable to spend time with, it's just that there's nothing particularly bold or original here, despite being a heckin good time in genre-ville.",2 Guns
51,kluseba,The usual conspiracy flick with dry humour and great acting,8,1 August 2013,"""Two Guns"" is a very entertaining action movie that mixes brutal and tension filled moments on one side with a lot of addicting dry humour on the other side. The chemistry between the two outstanding main actors Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg is simply great. The first one portrays a cynic and sometimes even misanthropic cop with strong nerves who has only one weak point which happens to be his superior Deb with whom he has a complicated romantic relationship. The latter one portrays a smart but quite offensive US marine who naively believes in justice and truth at all costs. Denzel Washington somewhat portrays the true face of modern America while Mark Wahlberg stands for idealized illusion of it. Both characters are quite different and complement each other very well in this movie.They are both working on an undercover mission without knowing each other's identity. They have infiltrated a Mexican drug cartel and are led to steal three million US dollars from a bank that is used by the drug cartel. When they finally rob the bank, they discover that there are not only three million but forty-three million dollars. The US marine gets away with the money and encounters his superiors but they want to eliminate him for not having killed his partner and done his job properly in every detail. The cop is not only followed by his superiors but gets also tracked down by a mysterious gang who is after the money. In addition to this, the drug cartel is also seeking for revenge and wants to get its money back. The two quite different partners need to team up to fight against drug cartels, the police, marines and members of the secret service to get rid of the money and out of this disaster alive.The movie works great because of many explosive action scenes, a good dose of dry humour and an authentic acting performance from all main and supporting actors. The story is your usual conspiracy flick which gets a little bit predictable. In the end, there was one scene that happened a little bit too quickly for me to fully understand it when one of the main actors found the stolen money but apart of that the movie has a vivid but not hectic pace and is easy to follow. The side story with the cop's superior portrayed by Paula Patton was too constructed and somewhat unnecessary to me and took the attention away from the main issue but nothing's perfect.Fans of the two main actors and conspiracy flicks shouldn't miss this one out. This movie is far from being revolutionary but it's entertaining and definitely worth a walk to the movie theatres. I wouldn't though recommend to purchase this film. You can see it once and truly enjoy it from the beginning until the end but it doesn't request more attention.",2 Guns

53,aharmas,What was the movie's name? Labyrinth?,4,11 August 2013,"Thank God for Whalberg and Washington. They do have chemistry, can keep you engaged with almost whatever you give them. In fact, if there's anything to praise about this film is its casting choices. When we start picking it apart, it gets, to say the least, quite confusing.Has anyone ever heard less is more? In this case, we are somewhat led to believe that we are going to be entertained by the pairing of two agents looking for roughly $3 million dollars. Things get complicated with the arrival of drug dealers, the CIA, and the Navy. Add to that an old flame, and a few double crossings, double-double crossings, and quite a few border crossings, and soon you're exhausted, and the only thing you want is for this END.It amazes me the level of physical comedy both Whalberg and Washington can handle, and it's a pity that their fabulous comedic resources are not better served. Instead there is the regular mix of obscene references and jokes, as if there is no other way to get audiences interested. It appeals to the lowest common denominator, and in these modern times, if a movie is to succeed, it needs to demand repeated viewings, and this is not happening here.Yes, there are a few set pieces that Hollywood is capable of doing, but they are few, and they really don't amount to much because by the time they happen, we're too exhausted to care, and other than the Bromance of the main actors, everyone could just walk off the picture, and nothing would matter.It'd be interesting if these two actors would team up again, using a similar, more refined formula. Next time they should demand at least a writer that can stay focused, and find a story that can at least seem realistic. It's been done before.",2 Guns

You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.What supposed to be an action/comedy, turned out to be a boring somnolent movie. The ""somnolent"" part is meant literally. It took me two sessions to watch it because I fell asleep somewhere in the middle. The movie was ""THAT"" intriguing. It's an exhausting movie with a relatively chaotic story.The action was limited to a very uninspired gunfight at the end of the film. I had little hope that the fierce-looking bull would work out his frustration on Papi Greco. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We surely would get some beautiful images then. The rest of the action is just some boys bragging.Now let's talk about the humor. Was there any humor anyway ? My granddad's humor was far more better than what the two men exhibited here. And my grandfather's humor was not more then the ""pull my finger"" joke. This movie was no more than a crossfire of one-liners. It was a constant competition between the two of them to come up with the coolest one-liner. Even in a hopeless situation where they hang upside down, they still try to be funny at that ultimate last minute. Bruce Willis did this trick many years ago in the first ""Die Hard"" films, but he ""WAS"" funny.Denzel was a real bad ass. He has the perfect looks and feelings for someone like that. It seemed as if he just walked of the set of ""Training Day"" or ""Safe house"". If you look at Washington's career, you know in advance that he's going to perform in a very solid way and he's someone who can bring a movie to a higher level. Well it didn't help much in this movie.Wahlberg on the other hand, doesn't have the mentality to look like a tough guy you don't want to get in trouble with. With his toothpaste smile and his angels face he's rather a smooth guy who makes women faint. He always reminds me of a snobbish pretentious pushful man. This movie resembles ""Pain & Gain"" where he also plays a would-be action figure. The latter movie wasn't my taste either. I rather see him play a part like he did in ""Contraband"".Paula Patton tried to make it a bit more interesting with some functional nudity, but that was to late.Since it's an adaptation of a comic book , the story is not profound and sometimes unreal naive. The fact that the two men operate along each other without them knowing they both work undercover, could have given this movie an interesting touch. Eventually, it worked more on my nerves than anything else. The story then proceeds in a highly creative way : both men plan a bank robbery to screw a mob boss, only to find out that they stole money from the CIA. The result of it all is that they got chased by an extremely perfectionist gang. By the way, I thought that Earl, the important person of the CIA, was quite a psychopathic cruel little man who continuously tortured everybody to get that money back. We end with a bang and swirling dollar bills. And you already know it's not the full amount that flies in the air. Not very original ! The best and the most funny moment in the whole film was the shooting of the chickens (All Greenpeace members in Europe will be perplexed,dazed and upset). At that time, Wahlberg was at its best.

57,burlesonjesse5,"Silly buddy cop movie has lots of guns, clichés, and an okay script",5,7 May 2014,"If I had the power to rename the film 2 Guns, I'd change it to ""2000 Guns"". Every single frame is filled to the brim with them (all kinds too). Not only are the weapons in this flick used to kill people (obviously), they're also used for good old fashioned torture. Yeah, 2 Guns is a so called action comedy and it's completely out of control. As I viewed this bullet ridden, macho laden, testosterone filled, bloated mess of an exercise, I started to try and keep track of certain things. However, I lost count. I couldn't tell you how many times someone pointed a gun at someone else (complete with nasty threats too) and I couldn't for the life of me, keep track of how many times a character said, ""where's the money?"" or ""where's my money?"" Added to that, I also had my head spinning trying to keep track of how many times the main characters weaseled their way of trouble or certain death (I'm thinking a handful of Mexican standoffs went down during all this). So OK, one word basically describes 2 Guns: preposterous. It has a plot that is so muddled and so unbelievably elaborate at the same time. It has your standard buddy action clichés that run rampant all throughout. And it has the leads, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg trying to reinvent a now tired genre. They have a small amount of screen chemistry but to be frank, we've seen it all before. And it has been done better countless times over.With three different sets of villains and virtually no one to trust (no one is safe in this film and the police are hardly anywhere to be found), 2 Guns tells the story of an undercover (possibly former) Naval Intelligence Officer (Michael Stigman played by Mark Wahlberg) and an undercover DEA agent (Robert Trench played by Denzel Washington with his typical flair) who pose as criminals (whatever) and rob a bank for two different reasons. Stigman is trying to get reinstated as an officer by deliver the money to his commanding superiors. This is to be done so that the Navy can illegally contribute to fund certain covert operations. Denzel's character, well he has to acquire the loot so he can have enough evidence to prosecute drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) for money laundering (you have to view this movie in order for it to make sense and I would advise against viewing 2 Guns in general). This sets off a chain of events when the robbery goes afoul and Stigman and Trench blow their cover (not to the bad guys mind you, but to each other). Here's the part of 2 Guns that really turns me off. The subsequent heroes that you're supposed to root for (Stigman and Trench) become more unlikable as the film glides by. By the end, you want them to be put in jail because they become almost as cold and ruthless as everyone else.To sum things up, there's no real reason to see this film unless you're a Denzel Washington fan. He's still the coolest dude in the room no matter what (he's even got a cool walk that is displayed in all his other movies. It's still cool, trust me.). Wahlberg, well he's popping up in everything these days and his outright screen presence is beginning to annoy me. He needs to be a little pickier about his projects. On a slightly more positive note, I do suppose the film's eye candy, Paula Patton, might become a big star one day. And maybe it was fun to see Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton take on villainous roles (Paxton overdoes it though as a ruthless bank owner with a painfully, tired southern accent). But all in all, 2 Guns is ""too much."" It's not quite original enough to wow you (despite the endless pyrotechnics) and it's too mean spirited for you to care about anyone involved. In the first half of the film, ""Stig"" (Wahlberg) says to Bobby (Washington), ""did you miss me?"" For me, that wouldn't be a difficult question to answer. Do I miss the good old days when buddy action movies mattered? Yes. Will I ever miss this flashy mash up of overindulgence? No way.",2 Guns

And, from here things get twisty after Stig learns that Bobby Beans is a DEA agent and shoots Bobby and takes off with the money. And also, it is here that the story hinges on the $43-million and brings out other players from the woodwork.We are not sure if Bobby Beans and/or Stig are really good guys or bad guys and it takes a long while for us to know which is which.

Buddy cop movie 101",7,25 September 2013,"Relies heavily on chemistry between its talents and quintessential gunslinger bravado, 2 Guns excels with classic explosion and slow-mo bullet dispenser moments. Mark Whalberg and Denzel Washington are well cast, they seem comfortable in their roles and exhibit the action oriented partnership patented in the late 80s. However, the story might have some inconsistent rhythm and convenient coincidental occurrences that could hamper the experience, considering it tries to put quite a few twists along the way.Story revolves around the two main protagonists, Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Whalberg), who are undercover DEA and undercover Navy officer, respectively and unbeknownst to one another. Each plans to rob a bank for 3 million dollar and pins the deed to the other. They eventually find much more than they expect in the vault and will be hunted for this abundance of cash by drug lord and other shady organizations.There are arguably many angles to cover, especially since the perspective shifts quite a lot.The movie does a decent job of stringing these events together, but there are some cases which seems overly rushed. Timeline is used in a back and forth manner, locations could be identified more clearly. These sudden changes may perplex some viewers who aren't accustomed to crime action movies.For a movie that focuses mostly on the duo, Denzel Washington and Mark Whalberg deliver. They are fun to watch, give life to compelling characters and legitimately look compatible. It's good to note that Whalberg fits more in rugged debonair with quips as he doesn't revert to his confused face too often. Denzel Washington is as charismatic as ever with somewhat threatening air at appropriate times.Bill Paxton as the corrupt agent shows capable eerie remorseless performance as a corrupt agent. Paula Patton gives a certain feminine touch, although a little less quixotic. The stars are aligned and script is suitable to the theme. There are some lines that could sound overly childish, but for most the dialogues are aptly written and properly delivered. Expect some violence every now and then, mostly intimidating grunts and point blank shots, common bread and butter of gunslinger movies.The movie has certain heist and conspiracy flair, even though they are sadly not utilized too effectively. It's also nice to see some degree of variation so the movie isn't all mindless bullet-fest. Ultimately, it thrives on old school appeal of underdog vagabonds with lots of ammunition, and in this case, isn't necessarily a bad thing.",2 Guns

63,cricket30,Malcom X & Markie Mark . . . Boom!,8,29 October 2013,"This action flick--2 GUNS--is based on a graphic novel entitled Boom!, of course, and stars actors (Denzel Washington & Mark Wahlberg) who have previously played the roles of Malcom X & Markie Mark, respectively. From BROKEN CITY and PAIN & GAIN to the upcoming LONE SURVIVOR, Wahlberg seems to be popping up in all of this year's most exciting films. Even more to the good, his characters' guns just seem to be getting bigger and bigger! As anyone who has seen him in BOOGIE NIGHTS will remember, this actor does NOT have any compensation issues, either. The general theme of all four of Walhberg's hits this year is that the government is out to screw you any which way it can, but if you just keep on shooting, you can get out of almost any jam. (Okay, I know, his character from PAIN & GAIN is on death row in real life, but that was one stupid dude, and if he actually had looked like Marky Mark, at least one woman juror would have held out for the jury nullification clause!).",2 Guns
64,leftbanker-1,Loads of explosions in the trailer: the hallmark of a bad movie,4,6 December 2013,"You have to wonder if the writers knew this was a totally silly script for this cliché-ridden buddy cop movie (talk about the king of clichés!) or whether they thought it was a work of brilliance. I don't know which of those scenarios is worse: a cynical decision to make a crappy movie or people just too out-of-it to realize they were making something unbelievable and stupid. I read in another review that this is based on a comic book which explains everything. Comic books? Does anyone read real books these days? I have a little theory about films. If there is more than one explosion in the official trailer the movie is horrible. There were four or five explosions in this trailer, a couple shoot outs, and several car chases. Wow. If we had been playing bad movie trailer bingo I would have filled out the whole card.As awful as the story was there were some great laughs in this thing. They should have just gone for a full-blown comedy and they would have had a winner. 2 Guns was definitely stupid enough to qualify as a comedy but I think they weren't going for that.",2 Guns
65,seymourblack-1,"Bullets, Banter & Betrayals",8,10 April 2019,"""2 Guns"" begins like a routine 1980s buddy movie with two criminals planning a bank robbery and swapping a series of witty remarks. It's soon revealed, however, that there's more to these men than meets the eye and the adventure that they get themselves into, quickly develops into an immensely entertaining, fast-paced and action-packed romp in which bullets, banter and betrayals all feature strongly.Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) had previously been taken in for questioning by the U.S. border patrol after trying unsuccessfully to complete a large cocaine deal with Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). During the interview with Bobby, it was revealed that he's actually a DEA agent who's been trying to infiltrate Greco's drug cartel but in view of recent developments, his involvement with the operation is terminated. After the two men are released, Bobby goes along with Stig's plan to rob a bank in Tres Cruces because he knows Greco launders his money there and (although he isn't authorised to do so), intends to turn in his partner after the robbery and use the loot as evidence to bring Greco to justice.The bank heist goes well but instead of the $3 million that they expected to collect, their actual haul amounts to $43.125 million. After a clean getaway, they stop in the desert and just as Bobby is about to arrest his partner, Stig shoots him in the shoulder, takes the money and rapidly absconds. It transpires that Stig is actually a Naval Intelligence Officer who was working on a special operation to steal the cartel's money to finance other future operations aimed at bringing down a series of other cartels. Stig then becomes disillusioned when his corrupt boss Lieutenant Commander Harold Quince (James Marsden) takes the money for himself and sets Stig up to be killed.It soon comes to light that the stolen money belonged to the CIA and their psychopathic enforcer Earl (Bill Paxton) uses some vicious questioning techniques in the course of pursuing his enquiries, which amongst other things, lead him into killing Bobby's DEA boss and framing Bobby for the crime. This leaves both Bobby and Stig cut loose from the organisations that they'd worked for and being pursued by people who are out to kill them. They then take the logical course of action by joining forces to put matters right and take revenge on those who had wronged them.Based on a ""Boom! Studios"" series of graphic novels written by Steven Grant, ""2 Guns"" boasts a nicely twisted plot, plenty of sharp dialogue and a whole collection of characters who are totally untrustworthy. Bobby and Stig had both intended to double-cross each other before their real identities were revealed, Stig was betrayed by two of his superior officers and Bobby's ex-lover, DEA Agent Deb Rees (Paula Patton) has a fling with him despite still being in a relationship with someone else and also puts his life in danger by not following through on an agreed plan of action that was linked to the Tres Cruces bank heist. With its collection of thoroughly disreputable characters and the seriously corrupt activities carried out by the DEA, CIA and Navy, ""2 Guns"" is an inherently cynical piece of work that's given a great deal of charm thanks to the presence of its two charismatic stars.Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg work so well together that everything they do and say seems to be entirely natural and highly entertaining. They're also supported by a very talented supporting cast within which Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos are absolutely outstanding.Importantly, for this king of movie, its action sequences are all exceptionally well directed with good use made of overhead shots and great panache being displayed in its exciting climax which uses explosions, shootouts and flying bank-notes to good effect. Whilst ""2 Guns"" may not be a classic, it's certainly a lot of fun and could never be accused of short-changing its audience.",2 Guns
66,antoniotierno,strange collaboration for 2 very different actors,6,27 October 2013,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg have very different acting styles that get to work surprisingly well together in this movie. The story is consistently entertaining, with corruption being so rampant between naval officers, DEA agents and CIA operatives. The action is spiked with many comedic touches, visual and verbal, acting is very good on the whole, the most interesting part is in my opinion the presence of two neurotically different personalities (Lethal Weapon style) with their unexpected complement. The result of this shoot-'em-up is funny and action-packed, though the story is not so solid but not a pop corn flick either.",2 Guns
67,areatw,Decent time-passer but nothing more,5,18 September 2017,"'2 Guns' is an average comedy/action buddy cop movie that's already been done dozens of times before, and in many cases a lot better. It's the type of film that you watch passively, without caring much for any of what happens, and then forget that you even watched it come the next day. It's moderately entertaining though, with some well-crafted action scenes and the odd decent laugh, but nothing to make you sit up and take notice.This film could have been a lot worse if it wasn't for Wahlberg and Washington's on screen chemistry. In many ways their entertaining partnership distracts us from the generic material and plot and is one of the film's few positives. Other than that, '2 Guns' is a very average and instantly forgettable action flick. A decent time passer, but nothing more.",2 Guns

Too much too fast too negative things happening all at once, without any real need or motivation. Boredom dominates. I was only amazed by few looks of hot woman, weapons, vehicles, shootouts...but can't be compared with movies that have interesting story and slower development.",2 Guns
69,drjgardner,No Buddies Here,3,3 August 2013,"Buddy movies require chemistry. Think Paul Newman and Robert Redford, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, John Belushi and Dan Akyrod, Dana Carvey and Mike Meyers, Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, etc. In the crime genre, think Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, etc. Having watched ""2 Guns"", you need not fear adding Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg to this illustrious list.For the past few years Wahlberg has been cranking out action films at an amazing pace and been nominated twice for an Oscar (""The Fighter"", ""The Departed"") while delivering at the box office- Seven of his films have neared or topped the elusive $100 Million mark, and most of his films have been among the top 10.Washington is no slouch either. He's a 6 time Oscar nominate and 2 time winner (""Training Day"", ""Glory"") with 4 films over $100 Million in sales and 9 in the top 10 for their respective years.But regardless of how talented these actors are in their own element, the buddy film is not for them. Despite snappy dialogue, there isn't a whiff of chemistry between the two actors. The fault probably lies with Washington who usually doesn't share the screen with a buddy, and even his film titles reflect this – ""MAN on Fire"", ""Inside MAN"", ""John Q"", ""Antwone Fisher"", ""The Hurricane"", ""HE Got Game"", etc.Wahlberg, OTOH, appears in films like ""WE Own the Night"", ""The Other GUYS"", ""Pain AND Gain"" (so bad I hesitate to list it here), ""FOUR Brothers"", ""THREE Kings"", ""The Yards"", etc.There really is no buddy film without the chemistry, so if it's a buddy film you're looking for, look elsewhere.",2 Guns
70,phubbs,2 Guns,4,26 November 2013,"Whoa never knew this was adapted from a graphic novel, whether that work is any good I don't know (obviously) so I can't compare here. The main carrot on the stick here is...I don't know if there is one, so I guess its the team up of Washington and Wahlberg. Yep its another buddy action flick but this time one guy is undercover DEA and the other is an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer.So that's the main surprise up front, you'd half expect this to be a straight up crime thriller with two lowdown criminals double crossing each other amidst much dark humour. Either that or you'd expect this to be a straight up buddy cop action thriller with lots of rebellious anti rule book attitude...but you'd be wrong. Two undercover uniforms trying to knab the same bad guy by stealing money from him so they can do him for money laundering. Thing is the cash belongs to the CIA and they want it back by any means necessary. And at the same time the Navy wants the cash for its own purposes, or some dirty officers do anyway.Yes its yet another double crossing twist filled plot with lots of characters and various sub plots which leaves you wondering who's gonna get shot by their so called partner next. What I did like about this film is the fact that its uniforms fighting against each other, Navy, CIA and DEA, with some standard issue drug dealers in for good measure. That's the only original idea on the plate, the rest is just a mess of your average factory line greed induced back stabbing which has been done to death now.The main duo played by Washington and Wahlberg are a good combination no doubt, they work well together and play off each other surprisingly well despite their clash in styles. It does feel a bit off track at times with Wahlberg coming across like the type of character you'd expect to see in a film like this, a kind of '48 Hours' actioner. Where as Washington does at times feel a tad out of place, he's a good strong actor and almost feels too rigid for the role, too epic if you will, for such a quickfire thriller.Twenty minutes in and I was bored, sorry but I was. Nothing really happens in the film other than a lot of snappy dialog which tries to be smarter than it really is. The films poster shows the highlight of the movie probably because there isn't anything else to brag about. Olmos does make a good Mexican drug dealer in that stereotypical type of way, the dude looks so damn cheesy its almost funny. Where as Paxton is trying way way too hard to be a memorable bad guy and failing embarrassingly. He isn't in the least bit threatening or intimidating much like everyone else in the film, its just all wind and no fart.A disappointing film which I can't really call an action film as it has none, and I can't really call a thriller as...you guessed it, it has no thrills. The only thing it can offer is the odd scene with the main duo verbally kicking ass, mainly Wahlberg as he's the smart ass, apart from that its got nothing. Even the big finale shootout can't save this I'm afraid, seen it all before, move along.4.5/10",2 Guns
71,Bob-45,It takes good chemistry.,5,8 June 2014,"Once upon a time, a couple of writer/producers were hanging out, enjoying their favorite recreational drugs, when one of them said, ""I'm tired of making the same old franchise crap.""

Gazing around the room, the first writer/producer spots his favorite reading material, a comic book (Well, EXCUSE ME! A graphic novel). ""PERFECT!"" he shouts.Well, by this time these three writer/producers must have been as fully loaded as Mark's and Denzel's weapons. What else, besides a lack of talent, would explain HOW they created such an incoherent mess as ""2 Guns""? And, they must have been writing in sequence and coming down HARD by the time they finished, because this is EXACTLY how ""2 Guns"" plays; a humorous, promising start that turns convoluted and unsavory, barely redeemed by its finish, which must have written at another ""hangout"". Two guns has two fine ""A list"" stars; two distinguished character actors in Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton; lots of firepower, explosions and great one liners. Fine ingredients and great chemistry.

73,abisio,Best summer movie so far,10,6 August 2013,"In 2012, Kormákur and Wahlberg created one of the best movie that year; a movie so full of suspense, tension and drama (with zero humor), impossible to get distracted on it; but so suffocating that made horror movies look like Monsters University This year both of them are back (with the welcome addition of Washington) to create a captivating action thriller but this more action, less drama and far more funny that any recent comedy.The story has lots of twist; but all of them are logical and Kormakur gives the spectator clues to predict what will happen; and common, predictable clichés that not always end up as expected, in order to create more suspense.Better not to tell too much about the story. It is based on some real events; two undercover agents one DEA and the other NAVY; who have no idea about the other's identity, get caught in a web of betrayals between Cartels, Navy, DEA and CIA in the Mexican border.The best thing is that Wahlberg and Washington are in funny light mode (never see any of them that way)so there really funny and unexpected moments out those ""macho men"".The supporting cast, gets a few good moments; never the best lines but at least perfectly match the rest of the movie.Perhaps the final showdown could had been better; but is compensated with charisma of the two leads.In brief; forget all the crap released these past two months.

74,bryank-04844,"The movie definitely ends with a set-up for a potential sequel. If this is any indication as what to expect from Washington and Wahlberg, be sure to count me in.",6,23 August 2015,"Surprisingly, I had a lot of fun with '2 Guns', the new action-crime thriller from Baltasar Kromakur, who previously made 'Contraband' with star Mark Wahlberg. I didn't expect much from this seemingly stale film, but once the end credit sequence started rolling, I kind of hoped for a sequel. The on-screen chemistry between Wahlberg and Denzel Washington is the best I've seen in a long while. In what could be an off-shoot version of 'Bad Boys', the movie packs enough explosions, gunfire and laughs to garner a second viewing. The trailers don't do it justice.We're first introduced to Bobby Trench (Washington) and Stigman (Wahlberg) as they seem to be working for a big Mexican drug lord named Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) as freelance smugglers. The two guys plan to rob a small-town bank that supposedly holds $3 million of Papi's money. In reality, Trench is an undercover DEA agent and Stigman is undercover U.S. Naval Intelligence, and they're both hell- bent on taking out Papi and his crew. The only thing is, each man is unaware of the other's real identity and assumes that the other is just a regular ol' bad guy.That is, until they successfully rob the bank and realize that the $3 million is actually $43 million. And it's not Papi's money, but rather belongs to someone much more powerful than they imagined. After three different types of big government agencies turn on Trench and Stigman, the two finally figure out their true identities and team up to take everyone out. That means that there are more than just two guns used.What makes '2 Guns' so enjoyable is the hilarious banter between Washington and Wahlberg. Their ribbing of one another, as well as Wahlberg's lightning-fast rapid fire insults, keep the film flowing with laughs at every scene. Both actors are extremely engaging and light up the screen. Washington adds a bit of depth to his role as he seems to be a bit more double-crossed than his new partner, and he doesn't handle it well. Olmos takes a turn from being the admiral of the Battlestar Galactica to playing a mean drug lord who pisses on his own hands and isn't above beating his victims with bats or letting a rampaging bull strike them head on. Then there's Bill Paxton, in his slimiest role since his stint in 'Weird Science'. He plays such a nasty scumbag that you can't wait for him to get his comeuppance. His thick Southern accent is also very funny. James Marsden and Paula Patton turn in short but solid roles as well.'2 Guns' doesn't take itself very seriously, and tends to rely on laughs and fun action scenes to keep your attention, which it does well. Kromakur uses his camera to put us in the center of the action and makes us feel every shot and hit to our characters. The movie has a few suspenseful scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as a bit of blood and guts thrown around from time to time.The movie definitely ends with a set-up for a potential sequel. If this is any indication as what to expect from Washington and Wahlberg, be sure to count me in.",2 Guns
75,witster18,many plot and character issues overcome by chemistry and fun,6,20 December 2013,"extremely mild spoilers.This is going to be one of those nit-pick films. There are many plot and character inconsistencies, and many will be far too busy picking them apart to appreciate some of the finer characteristics of the film.What are those characteristics? First, Wahlberg is absolutely fantastic here. He delivers every line with panache, and his free-spirited character is a perfect balance for Denzel's more serious-side. Wahlberg adds the ""feel-good"" to this ""buddy-cop""(even though this isn't really) duo, and he carries the film.That's another thing that works here. The purposeful ""lack of chemistry"" between the two leads. For the middle third of the film the two are actually working against each other, and the chemistry in-the-end is only stronger because of the separation. I guess the heart truly does grow fonder.Another positive is the direction here. The action scenes here are done quite well, and this is probably a director to keep your eye on.The negatives.There's a love interest sub-plot that fails to build any steam, and there often seems like a bit too many central characters here. 3 villains, two boyfriends, three agencies, and enough motives to make your head spin. The film could have been made stronger by narrowing its' focus.This was actually the best of the 3 films(BY A FRACTION) I rented yesterday(that list included Elysium-59 and We're The Millers-60). None of them were any cause to alarm my movie-information constituents, but none of them were a complete waste of time or money either.if you like a decent popcorn action/buddy-cop flick then this is probably worth your time.62/100",2 Guns

Dedicate first 7 minutes of the movie to her and rest to the movie itself! Washingtom and Wahlberg were great, humor was cool and action and guns (how could we have southern states of the USA without guns?) were shining and shooting many bullets. The line which will stick in my mind is when Washington meets those two guys patrolling the border and they want to know if Danzel is a Muslim and he responds:Selam Aleikum! guns blazing!

79,JohnRayPeterson,"A little bit of sexy, a little more violence and a whole lot of fun action",7,21 November 2013,"First, a note about the director, Baltasar Kormákur; he's a busy guy, very, and he's been so for a while. Had him on my radar since the 2005 film 'A Little Trip to Heaven' which I liked a lot. He did 'Contraband' with Mark Wahlberg last year, and that might explain how they are reunited in this production. In any event, directing in this movie, loaded with talent could not have been arduous.SPOILER REMINDER; You've been warned. The full plot is somewhat complex but not convoluted. I'd capsulate it as: Homeland Inter-agencies debacle, run amok with corruption.DEA, Naval Intelligence and CIA, not to mention the drug cartel, are all out to catch DEA's Robert Trench and Naval Intelligence's Michael Stigman, played respectively by Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlber, but mostly, they're after the $40million the two robbed from Cartel King-pin Papi Greco (Edwards James Olmos), though only a small fraction of that was Papi's. Stigman is under orders to get the money first and foremost; again, he thinks it's only about $3million. Bobby Trench is after Papi and has been for a long time. Neither Stigman nor Trench knows the other is undercover; they had recruited each other, buying in the other's cover. Turns out the loot belongs to the CIA, whose been scamming it from the Cartel and that's why Naval Intelligence is after it; well not officially, just a corrupt officer, Quince, played by James Marsden, is. Quince had managed to turn Deb, played by Paula Patton, girlfriend of Trench to the dark side by setting him up for the fall so they could get the money for themselves, but the CIA doesn't let that sort of thing slide and hard case Earl, played by Bill Paxton, the guy responsible to get the money back is in no mood to be nice to anyone.Denzel and Wahlberg do a terrific job with their respective characters; the dialogue works very well for them and they know how to exploit it. I remember Denzel working with the luscious Paula Patton in 2006 in the movie 'Déjà Vu', which I enjoyed enough to recall to this day.There are a few serious dramatic moments in this movie but they are kept in check and are not overplayed, just as the humoristic ones are restricted to that which the dialogue by itself brings out, quite nicely. The action binds the whole thing and that's why it was so much fun to watch this movie. You get intrigue, double cross, romance and ass kicking, all neatly tied together and well balanced, not to mention a great Mexican stand-off in the end. No talent was wasted in the making of this movie and so I recommend it if you are okay knowing all I wrote ahead of time.",2 Guns

Okay, you still with me, because the movie only gets crazier from here on out, but if you can keep up with that, then you'll like 2 Guns.What really makes this movie work is the chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg. They're funny together, and they really make would could have been a standard, run-of-the-mill action flick worth watching at least once. It's fun about 75% of the time, and its thanks to its two leads, however, the plot is nothing new and it definitely is not engaging enough to keep your interest piqued, so do expect yourself to almost zone out a few times here and there.Ultimately, if you enjoy a fun, breezy movie that is violent and filled with expletives, 2 Guns will more than satisfy, just don't go looking for too much more.I give 2 Guns an 8 out of 10!",2 Guns

The haul they load into the car is not quite what they expect, but then neither are they or most of the people who take umbrage at their audacious heist.That's all you're getting from me. If you want the first half of the film revealed, watch the trailer. Annoyingly, though predictably by current Hollywood tradition, the potential surprise in the relationship between Bobby and Stig is given away in the trailer even though it occurs almost a quarter of the way through 2 Guns. I can't help thinking I'd have enjoyed the experience even more had I not known what would be revealed. It's your call, but I'd suggest you go in blind and let it unfold before you.What evolves in the 109 minutes of 2 Guns is a non-stop scramble amongst the dregs of the mafia, DEA, navy and CIA with millions of dollars at stake, an armoury that causes destruction worth millions more, and dialogue that rips out of the stars' mouths scything the innocent and slow-witted alike. In recent months I've found myself urging audiences to switch off their brains in order to enjoy more and more films. Not so with 2 Guns. This is the most fun on offer at the cinema this month with the bonus of requiring its audience to have their brains in gear to keep up.2 Guns has a very similar feel to Mel Gibson's little-seen romp of 2012, How I Spent My Summer Vacation (a.k.a Get the Gringo). It's an entirely different plot but it shares the tone, approach and humour. Neither film is a comedy per se but, like Gringo, 2 Guns contains some very funny moments that have the entire audience spontaneously erupting in unison. The chicken moment is a scene that will live on in your memory long after the film. Watch it and report back if I'm wrong.In Washington and Wahlberg we have two bona fide action stars who use their brains and talent rather than falling back on brawn. Whilst neither is truly stretched here, they make a fantastic double act of reluctant partners who argue, scheme and shoot at the other's expense. They are everything that Bullock and McCarthy wanted to be in The Heat but failed spectacularly to even hint at. Think yin and yang. And some.Washington and Wahlberg rule here. This is their flick and without them it might be a very different and flat film. However, the supporting cast rounds it out superbly with one notable, painful exception: Paula Patton. I've just scanned through my review of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and rediscovered my appraisal of her: There are low points within the excitement, not least of all Paula Patton's periodic impression of a plank of wood.I am delighted to report that time hasn't changed Patton one iota. She still can't act, she still has the ability to make us cringe but, fortunately, she still lacks the essential Jonah-like qualities to drag down an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable film. If nothing else, she proves comprehensively what fine actors Washington and Wahlberg are to overcome the experience of acting opposite a flaccid fish. Fortunately for us her screen time is limited and she is but one guff in a garden of notable aromas.Bill Paxton is as audacious as ever as a rogue in need of a bullet or twenty. He chomps the scenery as the A-Team's Hannibal chewed stogies, not so much acting as inhabiting his every scene and challenging us not to enjoy his egocentric Earl. And Paxton is in good company. Director Baltasar Kormákur (Contraband, also with Wahlberg) knows how to cast his films just as he knows how to choreograph his action; which makes it all the more astounding that, rather than cast his other Contraband star, Kate Beckinsale, he opted for the fish. Go figure.2 Guns is a blast. It's fun, brash, fast, intelligent and laugh out loud funny more often than it has a right to be for an action thriller. Without a doubt it's the most fun at the box office this month.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",2 Guns

Washington and Wahlberg carried the film tremendously and made for a fantastic duo. Additionally, not only was Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton great in their respective roles but they also just ended up rounding out the cast and made the film very solid.My only complaint was the film felt rushed in the end but it didn't really have any impact on my enjoyment factor.

Doesn't everyone know they're really undercover cops – Trench for the DEA, Stigman for Naval Intelligence? It doesn't exactly hamper your enjoyment of the film, but it is a little annoying that this development is all over the promotion for the film while the film itself treats the big reveal as, well, a big reveal. it's same director who done Contraband but i rather watch this better then Contraband but i enjoy Contraband i liked it i watch it thousands of times but i rather watch this more Action movie and i like part when Bobby and Michael shoot's at bad guys when money was flying everywhere i like that idea and action scenes were perfect no shake camera or anything just perfect shot of movie just perfect shot of camera i enjoy this movie would i buy it yes i think this movie is for everybody it's really good Action movie i saw in this year i got 8 favorite Action Movies on this year (1) Bullet to the Head (2) The Last Stand (3) Good Day to Die Hard (4) G.I.

89,lathe-of-heaven,You'd better watch out Guy Ritchie... This director kicks some SERIOUSLY entertaining @ss! Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10,9,6 March 2014,"Heh, can you actually believe some of the reviews here...? I'm beginning to think that some people somehow just don't feel relevant or important unless they come here and trash perfectly good films. I mean, what possible OTHER reason could there be...?Anyway, just like I say in my summary, the film TOTALLY reminds me of the most entertaining vibe we always get with Guy Ritchie films, but of course without the deadpan Brit humour. I really had a ton of fun with this film; I mean, with Denzel and Wahlberg, how could you POSSIBLY miss? To me, bloody EVERYTHING was dead on. The acting of course, and the writing and directing. What I really enjoyed most I think was the overall tone of the film; as far as I'm concerned, the director really nailed it.Now, if you DON'T happen to like Guy Ritchie films or this particular Genre, well then, sure, you will likely agree with many of the negative reviews here. fine. But, please don't bloody come here just to take a colossal dump on a very good film when you have absolutely NO interest in this Genre. Go watch the kinds of movies that you DO like and write about THEM. Please...Edward James Olmos was frigg'n great! I forget about that guy sometimes because I haven't really seen him that much since Battlestar Galactica. I think though that my very favourite thing about the movie that I really liked was the dialog and the interplay between Denzel and Mark. In the commentary, the director and producer mention that many of the best lines in the film were improvised. Good stuff!One reviewer here (one who actually HAS a brain...) sums it up brilliantly with his summary:'JUST WHAT I WANTED...'Perfectly said. This is PRECISELY what you want to see when you watch this kind of film.So, bottom line (and I REALLY love saying 'Bottom') is that if you do indeed really enjoy Guy Ritchie films or cleverly made Crime Thrillers with fun, entertaining dialog, then you should REALLY love this movie!",2 Guns
90,Magow-Intermean,2 Guns Review,8,7 April 2019,"An undercover DEA agent (Washington) and covert naval intelligence officer (Wahlberg) unwittingly investigate each other when they both steal mob money.
Owing no small debt to the buddy movies of the late '80s and early '90s, 2 Guns is a shamelessly old-school, efficiently directed but forgettable action comedy with charm to spare. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington are friends, enemies, cops and robbers in a convoluted plot which pits them against the CIA, the DEA, the US Navy, a Mexican drug cartel and each other in the pursuit of 43 million dollars' worth of MacGuffin. If Michael Bay directed a Shane Black script of an Elmore Leonard novel and all three of them were having off days, this would be the medium-octane result.
This does a serviceable job homaging '80s actioners but not a whole lot more. Go for the explosions, zone out for the plot.",2 Guns
91,HelenMary,Wahlberg and Washington work well together - entertaining,7,1 September 2013,"This film was eagerly anticipated by me, I've seen a lot of Washington films recently and you know with him leading the credits it's going to be good. Wahlberg too is good to watch. This film's trailer was great and the worry that it showed everything, as is common these days, was unfounded; the film had lots more to offer, wasn't too predictable although not entirely original, and was funny, exciting, full of great action and stunts and with a few twists and turns - or at least back and forths.Washington was good, though not necessarily at his best or most challenged in terms of his acting abilities; he was playing a little safe, a character/demeanour that he's played to a certain degree before, but showing considerable physicality and looking mighty dashing in Navy Whites. Wahlberg was funny, cute and he and Washington worked really well together making for an entertaining bromance sort of film - great action together. Bill Paxton was good as the bad guy but all of the bad guys sort of had a humour about them, including really dopey muscle, possibly because of the graphic novel origins of the story. Paula Patton (Mrs Robin Thicke) was good. It was very amusing, lots of laughs but a but hammy in places with one-liners. Very enjoyable film, fun cinema, good performances by a big ensemble cast with two stand out characters, but not much depth hence only 7 rather than 8. A film like this is what big screens are made for.",2 Guns
92,dvc5159,Buddy Movie: Part 50+,6,1 August 2013,"""2 Guns"" is everything you'd expect of the title - bullets, mayhem and everything that practically makes up the bulk of action films from the past three decades. It has professional villains who always miss their shot and two likable heroes you want to have a beer with. Let's face it, seen them once, seen them all.One's a DEA agent, and one's a Naval officer. They're both undercover as partners but neither realizes the other's true identity. Both realize the implications they're in when, after a heist involving millions of dollars, find themselves the targets of three different groups of baddies after a series of twisty plot revelations.Again, generic. How many times can we see the same kind of shootout and not be enthralled? How many times must we see the damsel be distressed? How many times must we look at slow motion explosions? Why must the (undeniably) sexy Paula Patton be undressed pointlessly? If you're not familiar with 80s and 90s action flicks, you probably will enjoy the action more than I did.What makes ""2 Guns"" work, though, more-so than the generic action described above, is the humor. Both Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are known for being tough in other movies, yes (and their star presence certainly pays off here) but the energetic chemistry between them was brilliant. They naturally play off each other like most natural comedic duos would, and some of the banter between them is downright hysterical. Wahlberg was funny in last year's ""Ted"" and ""The Other Guys"" and his comic timing here is great, but Washington surprisingly works well on the deadpan side of the fence. It's clear that both stars were having a blast making this film. Nice to see Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos on the screen as well.The film is directed by Baltasar Kormakur, who made ""Contraband"" with Wahlberg last year. While he has not learned much in the way of action sequences, he certainly did improve on his direction regarding the actors. Perhaps he should stick to doing dialog-driven movies.",2 Guns
93,rollernerd,Bromance to the max,7,22 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**""Never rob a bank across a diner that has the best donuts""Tonight's movie review is the action buddy comic book adaption flick 2 Guns (2013) starring my man Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who operate together for 2 years and together plan to hit and rob a bank with the intent to steal $3 million from a drug lord. The robbery goes accordingly but comes up with stealing over $40 million. Whose money does this belong to? Many unknown variables for both of the lead characters. What is also unknown to each other is that both are undercover agents, one with the DEA and the other with the Navy. What is known is that both have been operating together and to use the robbery to frame each other in order to capture a well-known drug lord. Soon one betrays the other. However, the two characters must team up once again in order to stay alive as both are getting chased by corrupt Naval intelligence, corrupt CIA agents and the drug cartel.This movie was perfect for a Friday night stay at home, chilling on the bean bag by watching chickens getting shot up, finding out that there are different levels of deception including double crossing and triple crossing and finding out who is playing who. Even though there are twists and turns in the film, the filmmakers do well in making sure everything fits together while not making the plot too complicated as it may appear. The movie comes down to the main actors, Washington and Wahlberg are exciting to watch with their snappy and vibrant dialogue and their interplay and the chemistry between the two just makes the movie more fun to watch and root for them against the odds both characters are up against including the likes of Bill Paxton, James Marsden and Edward James Olmos who all three indulge in a little screen chewing of their own different pitch black comic villainess in the film. There are a few predictable plot elements that appear to be very clichéd however due to the brromance and the improv between the two main actors, the movie is definitely worth the watch if you are into humorous banter and a few gunshots and explosions throughout the movie. Overall 7.2/10.",2 Guns
94,movieman6-413-929510,The cast had more fun of making the film than you as a viewer of watching the film.,6,2 February 2019,"2 Guns is an action movie with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. They play two gangsters who are both not real gangsters. They both want to help their boss to pick up a mafia boss They have to rob a bank for this, but it turns out they overtake the wrong bank, so the CIA comes after them. Now they try to get rid of the other person to give the money to their boss. Mark Wahlberg's character Stig knows Denzel to take down Washington's character Bobby, but discovers he's a DEA agent. He himself goes to his navy boss and discovers that he has been used to steal the money for the Navy himself. He manages to escape, but now the navy is also following him. Bobby and Stig know each other again and decide to work together against the Navy, CIA and Mafia who are all behind them to get the stolen money.
The film is full of action and good humor, but the film is divided into different stories, making it sometimes difficult to follow. Some things in the story were also somewhat vague. For example, the CIA boss always knows where Bobby and Stig are and also tells them how he managed to find them, but as a viewer you wonder how he could have known some things. The story also had twists and turns that you usually can see, but there are too many twists and turns about where it is stolen and who has it, making the story a bit tedious.
The cast did well and you can see that they have fun with the film.",2 Guns
95,gregeichelberger,Interesting buddy film undone by ceaseless violence,5,31 August 2013,"If ever a motion picture suffered enough schizophrenia for a roomful of Sigmund Freuds, it's ""2 Guns,"" the newest effort from director Baltasar Kormákur (""Contraband"") starring Mark Wahlberg (""Ted"") and Denzel Washington (coming off of his Oscar-nominated turn in ""Flight"").While the running thread of the mismatched black and white partners forced to work together has been a staple since 1958′s ""The Defiant Ones,"" this movie cannot seem to decide if it wants to be a cleverly-bantered buddy flick in that vein, a serious crime drama, a fast-paced tale of worldwide illegal drug operations or a violent action adventure (although there is certainly enough of that latter element to go around).In the end, it may just be enough to describe it as lightweight — albeit confusing — filmcraft which fills the week, earns a one-time top spot at the box office and is forgotten by the time ""Elysium"" or ""Planes"" rolls around. One could do worse than to pay full price to see this, but one would certainly do better to seek matinée fare.The plot, as equally convoluted as ""Contraband,"" has Washington as DEA agent Robert 'Bobby' Trench, who is in deep cover trying to get close to and bust drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos, ""The Green Hornet"").During a complicated bank heist (that nets more than $40 million instead of the $3 million that was expected) with partner Michael 'Stig' Stigman (Wahlberg) - who turns out to be a Naval Intelligence officer, the two find themselves wrapped in a mystery and stuffed into an enigma — and on the run from every element in the movie who wants the cash for themselves.The solution to this deadly dilemma? Combine forces and try to find out what's going on and who wants them out of the way. Of course, they both hate one another immediately (come on, we've all seen these type of films before) and they feel each other out like two boxers, substituting jabs with witty dialogue and ceaseless quips.Soon, with a vested interest in staying alive and attempting to keep each other in that same condition, a grudging respect and mutual friendship emerges. Oh, and then it's time to blast the bad guys to Kingdom Come.Yes, the derivative element now rears its head and this buddy picture veers off into a scene of utter death and destruction and — just as suddenly — back again. It's a pattern Kormákur uses again and again, and while it may provide him and writers Blake Masters (screenplay) and Steven Grant (based on his graphic novel series of the same name) some sense of satisfaction, the herky-jerky pacing of ""2 Guns"" may leave many in the audience trying to both catch their collective breath and wrap their mind around what's going on.Still, there is more than decent support from Bill Paxton (""Haywire"") and James Marsden (""Straw Dogs"") as possible traitorous allies/adversaries, and the cast seems up to the task, but the underlying message that the international drug trade is so tempting EVERYONE seems to want a piece of it seems to overwhelm even the most talented on-screen performers at times. Like ""The Eiger Sanction,"" you will not be able to trust anyone in this film.One can trust the banter to continue, though, with ""Stig"" playing the patsy (he's incredibly naive, mispronounces words and makes some unbelievably stupid decisions that Washington has to somehow correct - it's difficult to believe that a Naval officer could be such a moron) while Bobby rolls his eyes heavenward and both continue to blow the villains to small (and very graphic, at times) pieces, drowning out the more cerebral parts of the movie.With the quality of the two leads, both Academy Award nominees (with Washington a two-time winner) one would expect bigger and better things. As it is, however, ""2 Guns"" doesn't exactly misfire, fitting somewhere above ""Fled"" and significantly below ""48 Hrs."" in the genre pool.Had the director just eased up a bit on the violent aspects and let the leads play off each other more (like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy were allowed to do), though, ""2 Guns"" might have been a much more effective and interesting addition to the category.",2 Guns
96,nesfilmreviews,"Mildly entertaining, a double cross extravaganza, and completely forgettable.",5,2 August 2013,"Based on the ultra-violent comic-book miniseries by Steven Grant, ""2 Guns"" director Baltasar Kormákur hits all the right notes stylistically, but comes up short on everything else. Don't anticipate a hard-hitting drama or an edge-of-the-seat thriller because the real focus of the movie is on the ever so slightly humorous relationship between its two main characters: Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Both interact well enough together, but the film falls flat when they're separated, and sometimes it's for long stretches. However, director Baltasar Kormákur shows a great deal of improvement over the last time he worked with Wahlberg in the disappointing, and uninspiring ""Contraband"" (2012). ""2 Guns"" is about a pair of undercover agents, neither of whom is aware of his partner's real identity. Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) is a DEA agent and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) is Navy Intelligence, but both are playing the role of a legitimate crook. Their mutual goal is to take down the cartel headed by Lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Their plan to do this, which is never really explained in a way that the audience can truly understand, has something to do with robbing a bank where Papi's money is supposedly stashed in safe deposit boxes. After the robbery takes place, however, it comes to light that the stolen money belongs to the CIA and their enforcer Earl (Bill Paxton), and he wants it back. The DEA intends to use it in a trial against Papi because getting a search warrant would be too much of a hassle. Naturally, our heroes end up being targets for what they know, having to finally work together to piece together your standard run-of-the-mill double cross extravaganza. The real business of ""2 Guns"" is the camaraderie between the two bickering leads, which comes across a lot like flirting. They finish each other's sentences, order each other's breakfast, chat about ""Les Misérables,"" and even have a scene where they stroll into the sunset arm in arm. There are chases, shootouts, and explosions, but there is nothing here you haven't seen before. With the exception of the final shootout sequence, the cinematography rarely impresses. There is limited amount of fun had in watching how Bobby and Stig survive a variety of seemingly inescapable situations, but sadly the predictable plot keeps getting in the way of all the action. The elements gel well enough to make ""2 Guns"" an enjoyable summer cinematic experience. However, it is never any doubt how things will play out, and it's nothing likely to resonate after the dust has settled.",2 Guns

The story took some following trying to figure out all the convolutions taking place with CIA and the Navy figuring prominently, but it was great fun, and the violence while never-ending was not over the top like some others today.

In 2 Guns, we see Washington and Wahlberg playing similar characters with a cocky attitude, but who live by different codes if you will. Nonetheless, the chemistry is there and given that it's 2013, this movie serves as well as counter programming to the more big budget productions of our time. With charismatic leads and an enjoyable, simple story, one can watch 2 Guns and have a blast, as this is one movie that entertains and one could say, adds a fresh spin to the action buddy cop film.

101,Jonathon_Natsis,2 Boring.,5,21 May 2014,"A bit of a letdown in ways that might not be expected, 2 Guns is not exactly a sign of what's wrong with Hollywood as a whole, but is rather a by-the-book exhibit of the kind of stockstandard product that whimpers into Aussie cinemas around this time of year, unceremoniously wedged between the kid-friendly fare of the school holidays and the early entrants of statuette season. High on star power and little else, the film barely gets by on its quality cast alone, churning out a mid-level blockbuster that simply tries too hard too often.Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are a pair of undercover agents from two different departments, assigned to the same task of taking down a ruthless drug cartel headed by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). When their mission fails, the two are forced to go on the run, learning that each man thought the other was a criminal, and that they both have a sinister personal agenda at hand.If you like needlessly convoluted movies poorly disguised as gripping political thrillers, look no further. What starts off as a mindless but easily digestible comedy gets messy faster than a coke deal gone wrong, developing arcs involving the navy stealing from the US banking sector, the CIA supposedly in cahoots with Mexican drug traffickers, and the small matter of a missing $43 million in dirty cash pursued by every man and his bull, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World-style.It's impossible to keep up with the number of fake-outs and double-crossings that pollute almost every scene in 2 Guns, so much so that it almost feels like some characters switch allegiances twice or more in under two hours, completely nuking the line between good and evil. Ironically, it is the film's anticipated strong suit – that is, a simple story tailored to a fun Sunday afternoon in the cinema – that proves its rapid undoing, while an expectedly poor screenplay actually manages to pepper in its fair share of laughs, helped in no small part by Washington and Wahlberg's seen-a-thousand-times-but-still-funny buddy cop routine.Elsewhere, reliable veterans Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton (as a twisted CIA kingpin with a penchant for his own unique brand of Russian roulette) give rounded turns that are, quite frankly, too good for a film that does nothing for their respective characters. A flavourless slice of immemorable action, 2 Guns offers no answers, and will leave you asking all the wrong questions. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The duration was OK and the final outcome of the movie was also as fun as hell. I don't know but it seems that there are some movies that are just unproblematic, fun to watch and straightforward.

104,JPfanatic93,"A buddy movie that says 'trust nobody, not even your buddy'",7,2 October 2013,"Now this is a buddy movie if ever I saw one. The one buddy is Denzel Washington starring as an undercover DEA-agent aiming to bring down a drug lord, the other is Mark Wahlberg starring as an equally undercover Navy intel officer attempting to secure the same kingpin's cash to fund covert Naval operations. Naturally, neither is aware of the other's actual identity – if you think different government situations could adequately work together for a change, think again! – and they know they'll have to kill their partner somewhere down the road, but not before said road screws them both and they can't trust their own employers no more, which leads them to forge an uneasy alliance to get through their common misery alive. It's basically the 'why so serious' version of The Departed, except here the moles have to dig themselves out together. Of course 2 Guns never reaches that film's level of quality, but it surpasses most other recent action movies, mostly thanks to excellent chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg (giving the latter another chance to prove he can actually act, which is still a matter of debate in some circles). The successful and catchy interplay between Washington's relaxed and calculating thinking man and Wahlberg's charming but obnoxiously loudmouth man of action is the result of a surprisingly good script containing plenty of witticisms, absurd but surprising narrative situations and, as expected, a decent amount of gunfights. The movie betrays its comic book roots in an overall over-the-top attitude, with delightfully ridiculous action scenes, the use of politically incorrect stereotyping here and there (the vile and racist border patrol cops for one) and an excessively eerie and villainous bad guy with a routine for sadistic interrogation techniques (Bill Paxton!). Coupled with an abundance of snappy dialogue throughout, as well as a fairly intelligent, though at times a little convoluted, plot for this type of high octane action flick, it makes 2 Guns one of the more pleasant and enjoyable of this year's thrill rides. Ideologically speaking, the movie suggests there's nobody you can trust but your gun. You certainly can't trust government institutions, since they use you and abuse you at their convenience (which makes it all the more ironic I saw this film on the same day US government services throughout the country shut down due to the inability of American politicians to agree on budget measures, leaving the States in chaos). The DEA is corrupt, the Navy is a tool that only cares about its own prestige and turns a blind eye to injustice amongst its ranks for the greater good, and the CIA is nothing but an out of control private army for its top brass who utilize it to get filthy rich by smuggling drugs into the country in cahoots with the Mexican drug lords that only serve as their stooges. Heck, the Mexican drug lord in this movie (an unconvincingly Hispanic but convincingly scary Edward James 'Adama' Olmos) has more scruples and honourable sensibilities than any of the government's top dogs! When it comes down to mutual self-preservation you can rely on your best buddy, but once the dust has cleared you can only trust him as far as you can spit, as illustrated by the protagonists' continuing eagerness to plant a bullet into each other even up till the end of the film.

105,bravesfanc,Another Denzel movie to watch!,7,4 August 2013,"Denzel Washington is my favorite actor. I haven't seen a movie of his that I haven't enjoyed. Put another good actor like Mark Wahlberg and you've got a good recipe for a fun time.From the opening scene, the dialogue given by these two actors is hilarious. When the scene is funny without trying, it makes the movie way more entertaining. They go back and forth and it looks so effortless. The story is simple, these two guys have been working together not knowing that each are working for their respective people. Washington (DEA) and Wahlberg (Navy). They decide to rob a bank which they think is going to have 3 million dollars. Turns out, it's a lot more and they both get a little suspicious. If you saw the trailer, you know that they were set up and find their way back to each other to figure out who set them up. The one little problem I had, and its really not much of a problem as it is an opinion, I felt that it didn't quite have that ""it"" factor that some other movies have. While I enjoyed the movie, I didn't come out of the theater thinking ""wow, that was great"". And to be fair, not a lot of movies can do that, but I guess it was the expectation of having both Washington and Wahlberg in the same film.There is a bit of a twist in the end which you might be able to figure out closer to the end if you pay attention. Plain and simple, this is a fun buddy cop flick with decent action, some sex appeal from the beautiful Paula Patton, and great dialogue that doesn't make it as serious as some of the other cop movies you might see.",2 Guns
106,CowherPowerForever,Funny and Action Packed,8,5 August 2013,"An action packed conspiracy film filled with laughs, amazing acting, and a great story make this a great but different take on the buddy cop genre we are use to seeing. Stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg work so well together in this as sort of buddy cops. The chemistry is there and it makes for a great film from start to finish.The acting in this film is amazing. As mentioned above Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg work so well together and also has an amazing surrounding cast with the likes of James Marsden, Edward James Olmos, Robert John Burke, and of course the man who stole the movie in my opinion and that is Bill Paxton. Paxton has showed over the years he can adapt to many different roles and this film certainly proves that. His performance alone is well worth the price.Directed by Baltasar Kormákur who brought us Contraband last year is back at it here with another amazing film with jam packed and stunning action scenes. Sure some of the scenes are over the top and unrealistic however this is an action film and it fits here. His camera work is fantastic and the scenes flow by wonderfully in the big action scenes.Overall this film is well worth the price of admission. With amazing acting, perfect action, and filled with laughs this sort of buddy cop film has something for everyone. Final rating is 8.5/10",2 Guns

It started off well.. but it quickly turned into one of those movies where the main character/s would behave in a way that doesn't make sense. For example, they would do X when it would make more sense to do Y. In addition, the storyline had too many elements to it, and it wasn't easy to follow.

It seems that they keep making flop after flop and this movie was no exception. This movie was chaotic and felt like it was directed by someone with ADHD. It was predictable at best and sophomoric at worst.Denzel Washington does an OK job playing a seasoned vet and his co-star struggles as usual to keep up. Patton does nothing but plays a vapid pretty face, totally blah. It was a relief when her character got killed as it ended the viewer's suffering.The movie was confusing, hard to follow and uninteresting. It felt like something out of the 90's. All the gangs plotting for the 43 million dollars became really boring. I'm glad I didn't pay to go watch it in the movie theatre cause I wouldn't have been pleased.",2 Guns
110,StonedMagician,Average: 5.5,5,27 July 2019,"In the world of today's action movies, one has to do something different to stand out. While the chemistry between the two leads is certainly solid enough, it's insufficient to support the entire film, which comes alarmingly close to buckling underneath the number of cliches it employs. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington play a pair of guys who are skilled in the art of killing and are completely interchangeable. Sure, one works for the DEA and the other for the military, but that doesn't change the fact that the differences between the two are literally skin-deep, though their banter is often witty and entertaining enough to be noteworthy. Now, the plot. This is where things start to slide. The events depicted in the film all hinge around a single important one: the duo robs a bank in order to destabilize a drug cartel. While this sounds simple enough, it quickly escalates into a jumbled mishmash of conspiracy, double-crossing, and third (and fourth, and fifth) parties trying to get their hands on the dough. Try to follow along, and it is all to easy to lose track as to who's who amid the bullets and threatening stares.",2 Guns
111,eonbluedan-1,"Nuts and bolts, but really strong nuts and bolts",8,31 August 2013,"If you only saw the trailer, you may recognise '2 Guns' as an attempt at a buddy-cop style movie, light in tone, featuring an always-questionable Mark Wahlberg, likely to be carried by Denzel Washington, and from a director whose only known previous work is last year's 'Contraband', which bombed rather badly. Your conclusion might be that you will have seen this film before, and you'll have seen it done better, so despite your admiration for Washington, you'll opt out of this one. That was certainly my first impression. I am happy I did not go with my gut reaction, for whilst it is true that the director's last release was a failure, Wahlberg can be a letdown, and there is nothing here to really surprise us, it is NOT true that I have seen it done better....at least, not for a long time!'2 Guns' is a by-the-numbers, nuts and bolts story of a DEA agent and a naval intelligence officer, who are both trying to infiltrate a drug cartel for their own reasons. Upon stealing drug money, they find themselves caught up in a conspiracy rooted in nastier, murkier territory than either of them expected, playing cat-and-mouse with some very dangerous people, bringing into play a wonderfully villainous Bill Paxton, looking like he's having more fun than he's had in a long time. They try to simultaneously bring justice and stay alive! The whole thing feels very familiar, as it should; if you have seen 'Tango and Cash' or 'Lethal Weapon', you already know the dynamic between the two leads and the general direction the story is headed, although there is a distinct difference in that, unlike Danny Glover's Murtaguh, neither man is particularly straight-laced. Part of what brings this film to life, though, is the fact that you cannot help but think of early Tarantino as you watch it. 'True Romance' serves as a particularly obvious touchstone for '2 Guns' in terms of dialogue, character and pace; there are in fact at least two scenes that seem to consciously mirror famous sequences in Tony Scott's movie. Perhaps most surprising to me is how well Washington and Wahlberg work as a screen partnership; with plenty of chemistry and Wahlberg responsible for a fair share of the success, it would be unfair to say he needs carrying.Slick, stylishly shot, well-paced, with some vintage ""Tarantino"" moments and really snappily written, this feels like a trip back to the 90s in the best way! Okay, no big surprises, but director Kormakur knows exactly what type of film he is making here, and he hits a home run with it! Not likely to stay in my top 10 of 2013, but good enough to make it on to the list in the first place, which in itself is a surprise!",2 Guns
112,Criticalstaff,Fun mindless action,5,8 November 2020,"I decided to watch this movie after having subjected myself to rather emotionally draining films. I needed something cerebrally empty, devoid of any intellectual pretenses, and it is exactly what I got from this movie. I needed an emotional cleanse, that is what this movie delivered. And to be clear, I enjoyed it very much.The beginning of this film draws you in immediately. Right from the bat, you have a bank heist; two separate double-crosses; a desert shoot-out; a night action sniper sequence.; the introduction of the over-the-top villain with a tense interrogation scene. Time flies by, next thing you know, you have spent one hour watching this film and you figure; why not watch the rest of it. At that point, one hour in, the plot has been finally laid out and the rather intricate story, with countless double-crosses and hidden agendas is within understanding.The heart of the movie is not the action scenes nor plot though, but rather the sheer charisma of both leads and the very natural playful relationship they have. It is just great to watch Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg joshing around with each other. And interestingly, at a certain level the movie understands it as well. The plot is needlessly complex and intricate. But because the movie is so incompetent/uninterested in explaining the action, it allows focus on the acting. Same goes for the ensemble of supporting actors. Every supporting actor is excellent in this, and it is not meant to, but they each give these fantastically diverse performances which end up being the characterization itself. Despite the fact that every character is, on paper, basically the same: shady characters that want the heist money; they each feel distinct and unique. I could not tell you who James Marsden's character was or what his motivations were, something about money or whatever, but he was played by Marsden. And he played him a bit like a more annoying version of Cyclops. And that's all it needed to be. Same goes for Olmos and Paxton. They represent the same archetype, but with a distinct flavor.At some point you realize that the movie must have been a novel or a crime thriller, so there might be a compelling story underneath it all. At the same time, it feels like the movie was written by a six-year old. There is a prepubescent love of guns, military uniforms and arguably trucks. The scene that exemplifies this the best is when Marky Mark bursts into the admiral's, or whatever's, office and explains the conspiracy to him. Let's ignore why would Navy Intelligence investigate Mexican drug cartels in the first place, hilariously the admiral decides to cover up the story. I can see myself having played this out in the schoolyard as a child.But to be blunt, I don't care that the movie is stupid. It works on another level entirely. The movie never needed to be smart, nor did it proclaim to be. It's just simple fun.",2 Guns

114,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - 2 Guns,7,9 October 2013,"2 Guns is reminiscent of buddy cop movies in the late eighties and nineties. Unlike a lot of recent throwback 80's action films, it tastefully retains much of the fun factor by concentrating on character and dialogue and removing some of the modern tropes that have gone stale, like overloading the film with pop culture references. With its setup and buddy dynamic, at times it actually reminded me of the 1996 Adam Sandler and Damon Wayons buddy cop movie Bulletproof.What elevated 2 Guns from standard action fare were exactly the snappy lines and the buddy dynamic between Washington and Wahlberg. The two lead actors create a believable long-time friendship and it gave the movie a sizzling charm that you just can't look away from. Watching Walhberg and Washington rapidly throw zingers back and forth alone made the price of admission. After seeing his facetious performance in this film, it's easy now to imagine Mark Wahlberg taking over the role of Tony Stark in future Marvel films.The film has a good supporting cast. James Marsden and Edward James Olmos seem overqualified for these supporting roles. It's nice to see them but they have too little time to truly shine. Paula Patton is cast in a seemingly intelligent female role, but is ultimately there for her sex appeal. Bill Paxton is the only one who gets to properly chew up some scenery as a scary CIA agent with a flair for torturing his victims.The story moved along fast like a shark, for fear that stopping for a thoughtful pause would ruin its momentum and shatter the illusion of how complicated the plot seems. The action scenes are fun. More importantly, they are visible and you can follow what's going on. When it came to the finale, the film forgoes all the dramatic buildup from the first two acts and serves a lesser solution to its conflict. Had it been a slower moving story with less charming leads, I would have considered the finale a cop out ending.But this time, I just went with it. 2 Guns just oozes old school charm, and charm can go a long way.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",2 Guns

But if you come in expecting an artistic action as in the Bourne Series, you are bound to be disappointed.With star power pumped up through the leading stars, the story has very little to offer, in fact the only thing unique about the movie is the director's strange name (Baltasar Kormakur).The usual web of conspiracy, white collars with dirty hands, double crosses, a Mexican drug pin and a beauty, is spun with nothing left for the audience to guess.

The story is so outrageous and dumb! Every single character was as shallow as cardboard and totally ridiculous - you had to wonder if the story was written by a 12-year old!

123,MacTheMovieguy,2 Guns can't decide what it wants to be,6,23 July 2014,"Comic book films are all the rage now. Bet you didn't know that 2 Guns is adapted from a graphic novel. Even with that origin, 2 Guns feels like a direction-less retread.Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) start off the film as two drug kingpin-wannabees, but as the story moves forward, we learn that Bobby is DEA, and Stig is some kind of Naval Special Forces. They've been duped by their superiors into thinking they were in an undercover operation, and rob a bank for 43 million, that is just a CIA slush fund.Bobby and Stig then have to work through their differences and investigate who set them up, and why, in order to clear their names and survive. Bill Paxton is a CIA operative trying to track down his stolen money. James Marsden is Stig's superior. Edward James Olmos is a Mexican drug lord. Paula Patton is Bobby's handler, an also random love interest.Mark Wahlberg is at his most entertaining here. Wisecracking his way through a rather dull script. Washington is about on the same level as Safe House. I thought Wahlberg stole the movie. Paula Patton was painfully put through a scene where her hair perfectly drapes over her nipples, only to be in another shot where her nipples are shown. James Marsden brings nothing to the film, but Bill Paxton is fun as a semi-psychopathic CIA agent, though he's never really believable as a CIA operative. More like a bad ass private eye.The film can't decide what it wants to be, as well as having a trailer that reveals a bit too much about the ending. Denzel's 'Make It Rain' should have been left out of the trailer. I can't help but feel that the movie is predictable, and even the twists don't really hit the way a real twist should. It's not a particularly bad film, I just don't think it offers anything new. It moves pretty quickly once it gets going, but it starts a little slow. I would say, you can see this film, just don't rush out to see it. I felt the same way about the last Kormakur/Wahlberg production, Contraband.",2 Guns
124,tiffanyyongwt,A surprisingly humorous movie which made me eat my words.,7,17 September 2013,"I caught this trailer a few times for the past few months and I told my friend this is one movie I'm not planning to watch. Two men bickering like women on screen, dusty setting with lots of car crashes and gun shots, it looked like a no brainer. But yes, this review here meant that I've watched it. And I got to say, I had to eat my words. The film was pretty good, and hilarious.But I was right about one thing. 2 Guns is really a little over the top. Some parts simply don't make sense when you think about it (That is if you have the time to think through). The part about robbing a bank and uncovering the money to prove the drug dealings might make some sense for Bobby (Washington) but robbing a bank for the U.S naval for funding? Hello Stigman (Wahlberg), that's ridiculous!Ridiculous plot aside, you can't help but enjoy Washington and Wahlberg on screen. The skillful filming technique had enhanced the offhanded chemistry which make me laugh. Two undercover cops with different attitudes, styles and slangs created a few memorable moments which elevate the rather standard buddy action comedy.

125,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,You've seen this before...but not with Denzel and Wahlberg...,7,5 August 2013,"Every movie poster and commercial you see prominently shows off Denzel and Wahlberg, and practically nothing else. And it's an accurate description of the movie - the two stars carry the entire film from start to end. And that's not really a bad thing...the two of them work very well together. They seem to gel naturally and have fun together, almost to the point where you wonder if some of the script is being ad-libbed by them. You really didn't need much of anything else - just give those two enough bodies to shoot at, and enough screen time to talk in between the shooting. (But I will say that Edward James Olmos plays a solid role as the drug kingpin ""Papi Greco"", and Paula Patton is easy on the eyes...)The story itself is all over the place...Denzel and Wahlberg are two undercover agents (DEA and Naval Intel, respectively) that get caught up in a huge crossfire between their two agencies, the CIA, and a powerful drug lord, and it becomes a question of who's playing who? The obvious solution to it all, of course, is to kill everyone and blow up a few things in the process. You can catch a hint of graphic novel-styling in the whole thing (yes, this is technically a comic-book movie!)Overall, the movie was much better than I expected...maybe I shouldn't have underestimated Denzel and Wahlberg, especially in laid-back action roles where they can add some humor into the mix. My thought going in was that this will be the same movie we've seen a hundred times...and it was. But it's DENZEL and WAHLBERG doing this one. If you're a fan of either of these two guys, the movie is a safe bet.2 Guns scores a 3.5 of out 5 on The BDBOS.(Fun fact: During development, the movie had Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson cast as the lead roles...this movie would have been WAAAAAAY different...but I think we got the best of that trade...lol) (My friends, if you enjoyed this review, perhaps I could interest you in my humble little page... www.facebook.com/TheBDBOS.

126,chi-cerca-trova,Spade review for 2 Guns,7,1 October 2013,"Overall: This is a by the numbers summer thriller, which is not a bad thing at all; this is a fun, relaxed action movie that really lets Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington just have at the characters. The action is well thought out, the comedy is pretty witty and overall, it is a fun comfort movie. 7/10Detailed Review:A) Story/Script: This film really follows the established post-9/11 thriller tropes: evil CIA conspiracy, rouge agents, Mexican standoff climax set in an anonymously set, washed out color palette. But it does work, but this is mainly due to the casting more than the actual writing. However, it is handled deftly by director Baltasar Kormákur, who shows a decent grasp of making an unpretentious, fun action movie. Ultimately, the story serves its basic purpose and moves the action from set piece to set piece. 6/10B) Characters: The characters are nothing new; we have seen these types many times before during past summer seasons. However, what really sets this a part is the chemistry and charisma of both Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. They play extremely well off of each other, elevating a straight forward, by the numbers story into something a bit more entertaining and memorable. Bill Paxton delivers a solid performance as the lead villain, taking something that obviously had little meat on it and making it an enjoyable performance. 8/10C) Design: The design of the movie serves its purposes, but nothing particularly spectacular. A mostly brown and tan color palette does not push new ground, but continues to serve the genre well. 5/10 D)Sound/Music: The music is an appropriate spy/techno-thriller soundtrack; soft but driving drums, a bit of rock guitar and some picked, Spanish style guitar. Same with the sound. Nothing special, with gunshots and explosions given proper weight and prominence in the foley track. 5/10E) Purpose/Misc: This is an excellent summer, action spy piece. While there are some creative western genre touches, it manages to stick to basic action tropes, delivering a fun experience as expected. Will likely fall into the same line as films such as ""The A-Team"" and ""The Losers"" from a few years ago: not entirely forgettable, but not particularly memorable. A great time at the movies anchored by two, effortlessly charismatic lead performances. 7/10",2 Guns

131,naregian,"Not an average buddy cop type of film, but nothing too special",7,1 August 2013,"7/10I had heard about this movie back before the main cast was attached and once I heard Marky Mark and Denzel were on board, I had to see it as soon as it came out. Lucky enough, my local theater had it 4 hours earlier than most so I caught an 8 p.m. showing with a heavily packed crowd who I laughed along with much more than I thought I would, but more about that later.The movie had a little bit of The Departed in it in terms of plot and characters, and had little hints of comedic buddy cop films like Rush Hour. The plot itself was pretty well thought out with a few minor lazy elements but overall it made for an entertaining and very quick 109 minutes. Despite having somewhat predictable twists and turns, the way they play out in terms of result/consequence keep you guessing if only at least for a little bit, and it's those minor sequences of suspense or confusion that kept the movie interesting for me.In terms of acting, of course Mark and Denzel bring it on and make for a believable pair of righteous men on a track they can't quite figure out. The introduction of so many different crews of people after our two main protagonists reminded me of Midnight Run. To the some of you who remember that film, if you liked that, I can tell you that many of it's elements are brought to surface in 2 Guns.One thing to be noted is definitely the very pleasantly surprising amount of genuinely funny content throughout the movie. There are very frequent scenes of dialog that are written ever so smoothly, and along with the perfect delivery of our two seasoned veterans, they make for very realistic dialogs and conversations throughout. Overall, the film was very well written with very immersing dialog, had great acting across the board, but fell somewhat flat with seemingly predictable twists and turns, and some scenes where suspending your disbelief is just too hard. But hey, it was great for what it was trying to be: A fun, entertaining, lightly suspenseful ride!",2 Guns
132,www-aktomer,It never took off,7,22 May 2019,"Don't get me wrong. This was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the dialogue and the acting(as expected), but the movie just goes on. Nice movie to pass the time.
The best part for me was the ending. Guns blazing and Mark and Denzel with their swag and quirky remarks. Yeah, I can watch this movie again sometime.",2 Guns
133,tariq-hossenbux,Action Packed but Mysterious Too,7,17 May 2014,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg team up in a film that unfolds in an interesting way. The way they have come together is mysterious and their past generally is not revealed, but their identities are gradually developed. Their chemistry as a pair of stoically tough action heroes is entertaining as film keeps up a brisk pace. You will get a good dose of explosions, car chases, fistfights and shootouts in this one. But there is always a novel twist or two thrown in those scenes. A different punch or an interesting shot is there to been seen. The plot requires your attention as a web of interactions between the DEA,CIA, Navy Intelligence, and the drug cartel is slowly brought to light. It is only when the film is halfway through that you get a good picture of what is really happening. And the fog that envelopes the plot goes very well with the murkiness of Wahlberg and Washington's identities. If you want a little escape from the everyday a couple of hours in the action packed desert landscape of this film might be just the ticket.",2 Guns
134,dmurilloroman,"""Make it Rain!""",7,4 August 2013,"This summer action flick is an instant crowd pleaser with it's masterful blend of humor and action. Wahlberg and Washington both prove how comedic they can be, Wahlberg gets most of the laughs with all his pitch perfect deliveries and mannerisms. These types of films rely on chemistry and Denzel and Wahlberg surpass expectations. The plot is extremely layered and is not as hard to understand but also not as dumb as most people conceived it to be. This movie is filled with action sequences that are not at all generic and also contains twists you won't expect. Denzel does have his share of laughs but he is mostly in charge of the dramatic portion of the film while Wahlberg is nearly all fun. There are no dumb or cheap shots comically which is what makes this film so fresh compared to others. This is one of the most original summer films so far with an extremely fitting climax that will fill you with thrills throughout and will easily leave you with a smirk on your face long after you leave the theater.",2 Guns
135,KexUK,2 W's are too amazing,10,4 April 2014,"I'm not exactly a fan of 'shoot em ups' that seem to be a modern film trend relying too much on body count.It was, therefore, with some trepidation that I ventured into 2 Guns.As a Washington fan and not unimpressed (like some here) with Wahlberg, I took the plunge. I found the whole movie to flow at a good pace with well written, witty and suspenseful dialogue. All the acting was at a very high level.I didn't see one character who did not absorb me as can often be the case. The story line was intriguing and held my attention exceptionally well. The action scenes were totally believable and exciting, with some very good stunts being pulled off. But, it really was the 2 W's that crowned it. The interplay and interaction of these two characters was fascinating.Sometimes a quip, sometimes just a glance, a facial expression.The level of acting from these two, ably supported by many other fine actors and actresses, produced a very memorable performance and film. I have no hesitation whatsoever in giving this a 10 and look forward to watching it again, a few times, to be able to further enjoy, at a deeper level, the intricacies and intonations profusely scattered throughout the whole film. It was also great to watch a film where someone could actually shoot instead of releasing endless rounds that hit nothing! Excellent entertainment with some fascinating twists.",2 Guns
136,zachvalencia,Good Action and comedy,8,2 August 2013,This is a pretty good movie and is definitely worth watching and probably gonna watch it again when it again when it is free. If you love action there is a very good amount in this movie. The movie also has comedy throughout which definitely makes you laugh. Has a very good plot especially compared to a lot of movies this generation. It also has a good conspiracy plot so if you like that then this is also good movie for you. The movie has two likable actors in Denzel and Mark Whalberg. For Mark Wahlberg this is a big improvement from Broken Ciy which I was not a fan of. Wahlberg is also very funny in the movie. Denzel was good too and he showed comedy. In the end if you like action or like comedy or Wahlberg and Denzel I think you will like this movie,2 Guns
137,aequitas_veritas_007,Exactly What I Wanted,8,29 December 2013,"Film quality was great, acting on par, and action appropriately over the top but enjoyable. I had the awesome experience of watching this while pulling a 24 hour duty shift for the Army. It was exactly what I expected, and is one of the best bromance comedy-action movies of recent years. The way that Denzel W. and Mark W. banter back in forth is hilarious, and the action scenes are well shot out and entertaining at perfect levels of crazy. The characters in general in this movie are great by reaching perfect levels of what they are suppose to be in a cliché type film such as this one. They are annoying without being at the lame end of the spectrum. There is also a great level of....shall we say...bare skin to attract people in a sensual manner as well. Overall exactly what I expected in a movie of this variety, and if you want a great action flick, watch this one. I give this 8/10 stars and I will be buying this on BluRay/DVD.",2 Guns

Everything except the sadism scenes seemed like a phone in, walk through, rehearsal? This suggested a theory. Deliberate sabotage? Perhaps the director and editor decided they despised their stars and maybe the suits as well. They used weak footage or even asked for some rehearsal but the camera was running. This would also explain the choppy ludicrous directing/editing. Some of those reaction shots? The ending? C,mon. Can Mark Wahlberg smile for real now? Did he need counseling?",2 Guns

140,bobbystryker,2 Guns probably could've done with more guns but you should still take a 'shot' at this movie!!! Read on to find out more!,7,17 September 2013,"Very few actors have a resume like Denzel Washington, in fact I'd be hard pressed to really fault the guy's movie choices over the years. His consistency in terms of good film choices is pretty much unparalleled in Hollywood. Move into the international movie world and he may have some tough competition from Lau Ching Wan (Google him) and a few others, but in Hollywood he's pretty much as close to royalty as you can get.Flight, Safe House, Man on Fire, Training Day, Déjà vu, The Bone Collector, Out of Time, John Q, Unstoppable Jeez! The list of great movies this guy has been in just goes on!2 Guns unites Washington with Marky Mark Wahlberg in something reminiscent of an 80s buddy cop movie. The result is a rather mixed bag of tricks but worth a look.Bobby Trench (Washington) and Michael 'Stig' Stigman (Wahlberg) are scouting out a sleepy town for a bank job as part of a plan to hit a local gangster where it hurts. Unbeknownst to each the other, they are both undercover agents, Bobby being DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) and Stig being a Marine. When they end up looting way more money than they had anticipated, it soon becomes apparent that they've both been set up. The money belongs to dirty CIA agent Earl (Bill Paxton) who makes it very clear that he wants his money back. With the CIA, marines, gangsters and DEA's office all after them, the 2 guns have no choice but to put their differences aside to figure a way out.Sure, things take a while to get rolling, especially if you've seen the trailer and just want the movie to really take off, but when it does it's pretty fun. The camaraderie and buddy buddy chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington is what really carries this movie. Implant any two other actors and I probably would've fallen asleep during the first 20 minutes. As it is, the second half of the movie is a real treat. Nothing serious, it's not gonna win any Oscars and replay value may be limited, but I did find myself enjoying Bobby and Stig's childish bickering. It's great to see Paxton back on the big screen, he's clearly relishing playing the larger than life bad guy, while fans of the gorgeous Paula Patton will likely be left smiling too.Though not quite as good as I was hoping for, Tango & Cash this ain't, it's still a fun way to pass a couple of hours.Check it out!Rating 7 out of 10.FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",2 Guns
141,travis36,Bulletproof without the silliness,7,6 June 2018,"Very similar to ""Bulletproof"" with Adam Sandler and Daman Wayons but without all the silliness. Mark Wahlberg stole the movie. His character kept the laughs and action going. I though Denzel Washington was stoic at times compared to Mark. The plot was intelligent and kept me interested all the way through with all the interagency double crosses. A good crime/comedy mixture. It was a ""don't trust anyone"" movie. The comedy was smart and quick with the main leads playing off each other really well. The naval base chase scene was farfetched for anyone that has ever been on an active duty post. If you watch it for the entertainment value you will really enjoy the film. Deep thinking viewers will be disappointed.",2 Guns
142,LeeRob7,Bad Boys reinvented as Washington and Whalberg shoot sharp in bullets and one-liners,7,28 July 2014,"An enjoyable ride that will keep you interested and entertained whilst not blowing you away. Trierd and tested buddy cop formula with a unique twist in that Bobby (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent working alongside Stig (Mark Wahlberg) an undercover naval intelligence officer to infiltrate then steal local cartel boss Papi Greco's (Edward James Olmos) bank stored cash for different reasons that later manifest themselves. Neither know the other is undercover each plotting to ditch their short-term partner when the job is done but unseen twists and turns see the two go up against the cartel, CIA and US Navy together in a bid to change their own fates whilst eliminating their enemies. Sharp talking and even sharper shooting, this movie is jam packed with funny, witty one-liners and high octane action. The two leads play convincing roles and share great on-screen chemistry that works brilliantly from start to finish, surrounded by a good supporting cast and well thought out plot. Think along the lines of Bad Boys reinvented for an idea of what to expect, very enjoyable. 7/10",2 Guns

AND - Looses itself in the attempt. What is good ? The usual stuff ...it's a COLOR film ... and mostly in FOCUS... The acting is OK. Going from playful to candid. Then the script isn't overwhelmingly original or adding something to the genre. Actually the scene with the chicken made me laugh. Not that I favor stupid violence ...

Although the idea that the CIA, has money stored from drug deals is possible. Who knows what the CIA actually does.i guess this was just a payday for the leads, it seems they had fun with each other and having Paula Patton in the mix doesn't hurt.",2 Guns
145,KingKongKyle,"Went For Denzel, Stayed For Wahlberg",8,1 August 2013,"I know a lot of people love him, but Mark Wahlberg is hit or miss for me. However, when he hits, he hits well and he is the standout here. I really didn't think he could go toe-to-toe with a pro like Denzel Washington. But Wahlberg brings a comical levity to Denzel's drama chops that makes the whole film a blast to watch. There are flaws, don't go in expecting a clever plot or an award-worthy script; this is just a formulaic buddy ""cop"" actioner, but it's a fun one. And aside from our protagonists we get two fun villains in Bill Paxton and Edward James Almos, one miscast one in James Marsden, and the gorgeous Paula Patton as a love interest for Denzel. Films like this- Lethal Weapon, 48 Hours, Rush Hour-only work if the chemistry between the two leads feels real, and I gotta tell ya Washington and Wahlberg play off of each other perfectly. I really hope this isn't the last time these two actors work together. 2 Guns probably isn't going to surprise anyone in any way, but it does exactly what a film of this type should do-provide the viewer with a fun experience at the movies. Go in looking for a good time and you'll have one.",2 Guns
146,nowellkcrooks,Funny movie,5,29 January 2021,"Joke at the end where Denzel shot Mark back was hilarious. Funny movie and I somewhat liked the love story. A relationship where they were both at fault made it feel more natural, and a touch more tragic when Denzel tried to save her despite her betrayal. Had the woman had enough lines for me to remember her name it might've stuck more. Shooting was serviceable and occasionally creative. Denzel and Mark had good banter and relationship felt honest. Too many antagonists with too little screen time or cool moments between them.",2 Guns

You never get bored watching it, every moment has its special excitement.Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg & Paula Patton were all good, but the most I loved is Mark Wahlberg having this funny irresponsible role in the movie, he makes the movie a 10 star rate by his moves.Everything was good, specially the last scene when ""Bobby"" told ""stig"" that he doesn't blow the hole money.

150,emeiserloh,"Are video games emulating Hollywood, or is it the other way around now?",2,31 August 2014,"Formulaic action/thriller, and the more I reflect on it the worse it gets. Yeah, the actors all do their jobs well, and there is good ""buddy chemistry"" between Denzel and Mark, as well as a few signature lines, but one of these every 5-10 years is enough to cure my curiosity about what the mainstream public finds appealing in a movie, especially since it seems almost exactly like the last one of these I saw 5-10 years ago, and so on, where everything in the movie serves as an excuse for a fight, crazier and crazier car chases, bigger and bigger explosions, and more and more unconscious torture and killing, intermingled with some smartalec dialog and various threatening put downs by whoever has the upper hand at the moment.Of course, there is also time for a bit of T & A, though it amounts to very little compared with all the testosterone exercises among men, where good guys get to do bad things because the bad guys force them into it, and where there is little of value to believe in or make meaning of aside from the possibility of making lots of money and finding a partner you can trust.",2 Guns

The chemistry between these guys was immense you can tell they had a great time making the movie. It is one of those movies that twists and turns constantly with a great bunch of characters throughout the movie, there is so many funny characters and Mark Wahlberg has a ball with funny one liners and Denzel Washington's reaction to them are just as funny. There is plenty of a shooting and fight scene's some great car chases set against the beautiful backdrop of Mexico.

I actually thought Mark Wahlberg has become a descent actor, but after this performance I'm not so sure anymore. His character was more annoying than McCarthy's in 'The Heat', which is actually an accomplishment. Just not a very good one.And Denzel Washington? Well, he does what he does these days, making one mediocre garbage film after the next collecting his 10 to 15 million dollar pay check. With '2 Guns' he just added another one to that list.This film is just another one of these movies that you've seen at least a million times before. Only better. And probably cheaper. This is easily one of the year's worst films and it's not very likely we see another film this year that could be worse.",2 Guns
154,sschand88,Got it right !!,8,10 November 2013,"To start with the chemistry between to the 2 guns (lead roles) Denzel and Mark was outstanding. They were cool and fitted the roles so damn good. The roles were like a taylor finish, made totally for them. The casting was too good for the other casts like the Mexican and the cia guy. Patton did a fine job, not a huge role though like she had in the Ghost Protocol.I am a huge fan of Denzel. He's like the one of the finest actors in Hollywood. I'd never miss his movies. This movie might not have a platform for his skills though. Mark on the other hand had really turned into a matured actor. I was a bit taken back with his performance in the Ted. I haven't enjoyed his acting much but this one surprised me. His humour was top notch. Director got the combinations so damn right. It clicked them well.The plot was simple and neat. It totally depends on the two main roles. It's mostly about taking revenge. Don't want reveal or get any deeper about the roles. A good action flick to enjoy. I had a great time watching it. Good action stuffs and a Very good entertainer.",2 Guns
155,jpfloydster,"Not an academy award movie, but I must say very entertaining",7,21 December 2013,"This is surprisingly a great low lighted action comedy that works in many more ways than ""Contraband"". It's a fun popcorn flick, plus it's fun to watch Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg on screen together. Overall, a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night. Washington plays Bobby Trench, a cool customer plotting a small town bank robbery with caffeinated Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Wahlberg). What neither knows is that the other is working undercover: Bobby for the DEA and Stig for U.S. Navy Intelligence. They're both on the trail of drug kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) and the bank reportedly houses $3 million in drug money.What confuses Bobby, Stig and the audience for a while is why their robbery nets more than $43 million. It turns out that the CIA is somehow involved, with a sweaty, sadistic agent named Earl, played by Bill Paxton, leading the pack. The Navy, represented by so-helpful-he-can't-be- trusted Quince, played by James Marsden, also wants the cash. Papi isn't happy, either. A lot of shoehorning and short cuts are required to fit all this skullduggery into one movie but it mostly works.It's best to forget the plot and simply enjoy this bumpy, bullet-ridden ride. Washington and Wahlberg make such a wonderful team — a modern Butch and Sundance in patter and aim — that you wonder why Hollywood never thought of this pairing before. Each character has an identifying quirk: for Bobby, a collection of straw fedoras; for Stig, a punctuating wink. Mostly the actors are just having fun and it's contagious.2 Guns is a movie based on smart callbacks and sly flip-flops of loyalty, regularly interrupted by spasms of well-staged violence. The perplexing nature of Masters' plot takes effort to sort through but sets up a terrific finale, literally a Mexican standoff between everyone wanting the money, with Bobby and Stig back-to-back in the middle, spraying gunfire in all directions. It's a dynamic sequence that, like the rest of 2 Guns, proves overkill can be amusing.",2 Guns
156,aaronbroere,It's good,7,23 March 2020,"The movie offers two hours of action, which is carried by two excellent lead actors in Washington and Wahlberg.

The chemistry between Walhberg and Washington went down as smoothly as sweet tea at the end of July. The connivery was as unpredictable as The Departed and gun-slingin' scenes as gritty as Once Upon a Time in Mexico. This movie is what The Way of the Gun tried to pull off and failed. Wahlberg made for a convincing meat-head and Washington his puppet master. Opening scenes in a diner display just how well the two play off of one another, and as any actor would feel, I caught Wahlberg admiring Almighty Denzel during a few verbal back-and-forths. I highly recommended 2 Guns, just for a good time.",2 Guns

It turned out to be mildly better than I was anticipating. Mark Wahlberg brought a comical element that worked with the overall story with Denzel basically being the straight man throughout. Denzel plays his role smoothly with a slight sarcastic comedic side. I thought they both played off each other very well to keep you intrigued with the ongoing twisting plot. Good to see James Edward Olmos after a long absence from the big screen. Always be LT. Castillo from Miami Vice fame to me. Don't base your opinion on the trailer as I had. Worth a look.,2 Guns

He's double crossing him and she's double crossing him and he's double crossing him and nobody cares. It just felt like the actors were on auto pilot. I like Wahlberg and Washington and their the main reason I wanted to see this film. It should of been more enjoyable than it was to watch them play off each other, don't get me wrong I liked seeing them together and they are amusing at times (mostly Wahlberg) but still I expected a little more from two guys a talented as they are. Edward James Olmos' character is the only other one worth mentioning, as all the other's are bland or typical movie pastiches like Bill Paxton' corrupt D.E.A agent. You could swap the character's from this film with others from similar genre films and it wouldn't make a difference. People shoot at each other, car's crash and things blow up and I didn't care but the two leads got me through it.

Images of Rush Hour in my youth danced through my head, although, I was sceptical of the film I debated with my boyfriend for a few minutes and thought, ""What the hell, let's give it a shot."" , I sit corrected; I loved this movie.

Denzel and Mark have great on-screen chemistry and deliver a lot of laughs. I thought their dynamic was very good, and carried the film really well. Can't imagine this would have been as successful with a different duo. The premise is your basic two agents - one a DEA and the other military - double- cross each other, robbing a bank for $3 million that belongs to a Mexican drug lord, and get caught up in an unexpected conspiracy where the CIA is accepting a cut of their profits from them in exchange for continued business. What ensues is a high paced action, comedy and drama adventure while they evade their respective authorities who all want them dead. There are a few twists and turns but the story is not that complex and is not the strong point of the film. So if you're expecting something deeply thought provoking and convoluted you'd be mistaken in thinking you'll find it here.The direction is superb and the overall style of the movie is slick. There are more than a few thrilling moments and some great gun fights and car chases that had me smiling and feeling excited. All of the performances from supporting cast were good too.All in all fans of Denzel and Mark will be pleased with this movie. Don't have high hopes, just go in, sit back and enjoy the ride.

165,jaxsky,"Not Too Big, Not Too Small: Just the Right Amount of Fun Banter, Mid-Size Action, and Involving Story",7,2 August 2013,"There are a lot more than two guns in ""2 Guns."" Everyone has one. Sometimes two. Often more. And there are lots of different types: from revolvers to high-end military weaponry.And yet, despite the name, the gun play is less than one might expect. There is plenty. Just not so much as to get in the way of a well-balanced film. The action is punctuated by fun interplay between the two leads.The film is somewhat a present-day Western. The story is a modern mix of darker Sergio Leone with lighter Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The chemistry between stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg seems genuine, and their repartee is fun and provides a welcome break from the brutal villains.And there are a lot of villains as the number and groups of people looking to hurt our heroes grows throughout the movie. By the middle of the film, they are hunted or set-up four different organizations all with greater resources than our protagonists. It's the no escape and nowhere to turn, but it's played toward a lighter side rather than having us feel they're helpless and hopeless.There are relatively brief scenes of cruelty by the bad guys -- particularly an effective villain played by Bill Paxton. Smartly, the darker moments are soon enough relieved by the banter between Wahlberg and Washington.For the buddy-action-film genre, the story holds together well. There are no painful moments that make you want to scream, ""C'mon! Gimme a break!"" Sure, a few forced minor conflicts that allow our leads to bicker and fight, but nothing major.One distraction is the insertion of an agenda. In this film, it's the plight of Mexico and illegal immigrants. And while the movie soon enough gets off its apple box, I prefer my popcorn movies 100% message free (though I like my popcorn butter 100% not fat free).Overall, it's a more down-to-earth action film in the current age of over-the-top superhero combat.

The chemistry between Walberg and Washington couldn't be better. The humor (mostly from Walberg) couldn't have been any better also. The story line was fast and above all easy to follow. The action scenes were as good as one could want. Not over bearing (like this summer's ""Man Of Steel"")but a great crime thriller. I wasn't a fan of Walberg's when he first started appearing in films but have progressed to where I totally enjoy his current movies. Regardless,if you like a thriller/drama/comedy you'll love ""2-Guns"". Rated a one star by ""Ticklegear'???...give me a break!",2 Guns
168,jwwomack,"2 Guns or 2 Many Guns, Amirite?",6,7 November 2013,"First off, I would like too say there were way more than two guns in this film. To be more precise, I counted at least six. Wow. What a misleading title, it doesn't take the Warren Commission to tell you this movie is already headed downhill. Second, there is a scene where Mark Wahlberg shoots the ""heads"" of a pack of roosters that are buried neck deep in the ground. What's this guys deal? Does he not understand chickens have souls just like people? I was blown away when director Baltasar Kormákur decided to leave this gritty scene in his final product. Thirdly, I don't understand how this could be the ""sequel"" to the 2001 smash hit ""Training Day."" I was fairly certain Denzel Washington's character was shot until dead, and was also a drug dealer. How did he manage to pass the background check and get another job with the police force? Riddle me that America! In closing, I give this movie a 5/10 because of all the scenes where Paula Patton wasn't shown. Gimme some more of that, Amirite??",2 Guns
169,ronaldo_7142,good movie,9,22 October 2013,"DENZEL AND MARK GAVE US A VERY GOOD MOVIE BY THIS COMEDY SCRIPT WITH THE OLD STORY When it comes to the month of August, it is the place where the questionable movies go. The not-good-enough-for-July dump bin if you will. They are questionable because they are not the ""big"" summer movies, but summer movies none the less. When it comes to ""2 Guns"" I think the studio got it right. This is the perfect movie to follow all those sequels and not so fun ""big summer movies"" (yes I am talking to you Lone Ranger). How about a fun movie with two actors that everyone loves? With plenty of action mixed in with just the right amount of comedy, this is the kind of movie I look forward to seeing. Mark Wahlberg makes the movie, and the reason is simple, he doesn't play that guy he plays in almost every move he is in. You know the quiet but nice guy, who just looks tough. In ""2 Guns"" Walhberg plays a cocky bad ass, who is good at what he does and he lets you know it every chance he gets. Denzel on the other hand is just Denzel, which after saying that, I have said all I needed to say. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur, who makes a good version of a Michael Bay movie. This is a great choice if you are looking for something fun to do this weekend, because in my mind, you can never go wrong with a fun time at the movies HADDADO",2 Guns

171,Cinemaginarium,"Just like '100 Rifles' (1966), the title provides just a rough estimate...",7,10 April 2021,"THE PLOT: We are introduced to Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) bantering in a diner, apparently preparing to 'heist' the bank across the street. However, unbeknownst to each other, both are working undercover - for the American police and military respectively. Their heist seems to be a smashing success, but the fact that the loot of the bank robbery is much larger than expected quickly becomes a problem. This is just the first of a long series of twists, turns and double crosses.THE PLAYERS: Marky Mark already teamed up with director Baltasar Kormákur for 2012's 'Contraband', and here Denzel Washington is added to the mix to provide Marky with a (reluctant) buddy. The pairing of Denzel and Marky Mark works better than I expected, adding a zesty freshness to the proceedings. Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton provide excellent counter play as two memorable 'bad guys', while Fred Ward is not quite as good as another bad guy.THE PLEASURES: The diner scene at the beginning, the banter of the leads and the criminal goings-on reminded me of an early, funnier Quentin Tarrantino film. This effort doesn't quite reach the same levels, but it's an above-average flick somewhere in that murky area between action, bromance, buddy cop and crimedy. The snappy dialogue and plot twists lift it comfortably above average.THE POINTS: 71 - Solid and funny at times; a 'spectacle' with plenty of twists & turns.",2 Guns
172,adrian-martis,The movie is not predictive.,9,1 September 2013,"I didn't had high expectations from ""2 Guns"" but it turned out to be really good. I had some problems with the tickets when I went to see the movie in the theaters but I'm glad it was all sorted out and I managed to see it. The main characters are full of humor. Even from first scenes they make you laugh. Amused by the funny scenes in the beginning, you soon tart to get hooked by the plot. More and more unexpected things start to reveal about each character and you find yourself soon wondering how would they get out of the mess they are in. The movie ends with a happy end, like any Hollywood production. What makes this movie stand apart from all the cops movies I've recently seen is the plot which is not so easily predictive .I highly recommend it as a Sunday evening movie with your friends.",2 Guns
173,thesevenelevenguy,Mexican stand-off all the way...,7,6 August 2013,"Only Hollywood, or Denzel can cook up or portray a witty DEA agent who might keep Moliere's Misanthrope or Hugo's Les Miserables by his bookshelf and correct his equally fast-talking snapping partner when spitting french: Ce plus ca change...But that is exactly it. Ca plus ca change. Plot is not complex for a heist movie while the tet-a-tet, mano a mano, vis-a-vis tango between the two specialist of their fields is a treat to watch.For the ladies there is the fast-talking Wahlberg bulging in plain T, with Denzel in a cut above the rest, comfortable and utterly natural in his role, often hinting at his Training Day-meet-Safehouse personae.And the motif, or the theme, of Mexican stand-off, from two-person, complete information, game theoretic, spy vs spy, Denzel vs. Wahlberg takes literal two-dimensional fold at times, and is present throughout the movie.There may be some off-color jokes or crude language and humor for teens, esp. a decapitated man in a duffel bag is not your cup of regular noir tea.I actually got hooked to the film when I heard Mark Wahlberg in a local LA hip hop radio station mention how he and Denzel was improvising a lot, attesting to a creative sincerity, for a flow of ideas and output which was highlighted in the movie. Of course, even I was pretty prepared for the intellectual challenge esp. from the opening lines in the trailer, the Joker's buddy allusion in bank heist but sometimes the witticism and one liners went over my head.There was an awkward silence after an anti-Muslim insult which Denzel parried with style and his typical weight but that had no applause given the demographics, but the California tone set in deeply in the film, if not darkly, and I sincerely hope no animals were injured during the film.Other than the Muslim scene, the threat to douse with water, the sniper part, bank robbery heist the opening diner blow up was definitely a good ol' ""pumpernickel"".Overall a seven. The plot is not too dense, characters are portrayed with Vermeer perfection each given their own niche, with explosion and Hollywood action kept just to the point. Not bad, and something I would gladly watch it again.",2 Guns
174,Gibbs98-242-107917,Not as good as expected,6,27 September 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for '2 Guns' I couldn't wait to see it. It had so much potential to be a great film but after watching it seems to be a bit of a let down. Almost any Denzel Washington film is at least good and usually a great film, this is an exception to the rule. The plot isn't great and it isn't delivered well either. At times it is even confusing. The selection of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg to play along side each other should have resulted in loads of funny little lines throughout the film and both actors playing off one another. This was not the case. The script didn't allow the full potential of this acting pair to be utilized. This was one of the main reasons this film fell down. Without Wahlberg and Washington being used fully it just became a mediocre action film with two expensive main actors and a confusing storyline. (6/10)",2 Guns

Edaward James Alamos was great as always (loved him in Battlestar) And an old fave Bill Paxton was also amazing.Direction was pitch perfect. Editing as great. Soundtrack was fun.All in all a great, fun, action packed, often hilarious buddy flick that would of been right at home between 84-89.",2 Guns

But when they finally get to interrogating the Mexican drug lord they don't kill him and somehow they are able to go from the house to a car parked outside and drive away. What? They were in a firefight with two well equipped Navy soldiers. They also throw a bunch of story lines into the mix instead of keeping the story straight forward. If their goal was to make it unnecessarily complicated they succeeded. Throw in some unbelievable scenarios of the quest that they are sent on to retrieve the money and the movie falls from a 7-8 to a 6.,2 Guns
177,ThatWasVeryAwesome,"Decent action, less than decent plot",6,10 May 2014,"You'd think an action movie starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg would be an action packed thrill ride, but unfortunately this one comes up kind of short. Do not get me wrong, both actors bring strong performances to the table, its the plot that really drops the ball. Bill Paxton did play a great villain as a dirty C.I.A. agent who wants his money back. On the other hand it was hard believing James Marsden was a dirty Naval Officer. The rest of the supporting cast played typical cliché roles that you'd expect from drug lords and criminals.The fact that this movie is about two undercover agents from two different branches of law enforcement that are both trying to set the other one up is somewhat far fetched to me. Not only that but they end up stealing money from yet another branch of government. The film keeps making plot twists every time Washington and Wahlberg uncover a new piece of evidence. The writers should have tried to make this movie less complex, and more straight forward and added more action.When there was action it was a lot of fun to see the pair whoop ass on screen. These two action juggernauts were a couple of walking wrecking balls. Plus their repartee together was also refreshing from the rest of the cast. These two basically saved the movie completely and makes it worth a watch if you have some free time. That's why I am giving this movie a 6 out of 10.",2 Guns
178,AvihooI,You can't go wrong when Denzel Washington is on set,7,13 September 2013,"Without getting too much into the specifics of the plot which doesn't really matter. This movie is not a serious action movie and should not be treated as such. Instead, expect an easy going comical take on the supposed relationship between drug related organized crime and government agencies.The movie creates some sort of serious mystery to-be-discovered premise, but then discards it and moves on to pure comical action. I personally feel it served it much better.The action itself is pretty engaging - there aren't long moments of talk and suspense and trying to figure what's what.And then there's Denzel Washington doing his bit with a cool Mark Wahlberg kicking everyone's ass while having fun (not my words).Either way, if you're looking for a film to watch in the cinema and won't go for this one because it says ""action"" in the genre; you really should consider it as ""comedy"" and just go ahead and watch it.",2 Guns

Denzel can smoothly play any character that is thrown at him and I was surprised that he actually able to succeed in a action movie that has a an actor like Mark Wahlberg that brings comedy to a serious movie. Mark Wahlberg continues to amaze me in that he never tries to do more than he needs to which is why his movie are always a delight to watch.

There are a lot of problems with this movie such as Paula Pattons disgraceful acting or dull action scenes. The plot of Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington being undercover cops was interesting for like ten minutes before it dissolves into mediocrity. A cliché ridden script doesn't help, a viewer can guess out the end early on. Denzel Washington does a good job here, though. It seems he realized his role and gives a bit of a gravitas to it. The 'Russian Roulette' scenes were entertaining and a bit menacing. Mark Wahlberg does a generally good job here. But the movie misses where it most needed to hit. Paula Patton is probably the most annoying thing here. Once you get over the fact that she's hot, you cringe every time she walks in. This is just not a good action movie.

And of course it's only a personal opinion.So one of those actors who have no bad movies is Denzel. He's just an amazing actor. All his movies are so entertaining to watch. I can praise him non-stop. And it's also very nice to see his female partner from Deja Vu. She looks gorgeous and adds just enough of ""morsel"". ""Marky Mark"" added so much excellent humor. You don't get irritated at all. And practically all other characters are very good shown and played.Action part: shooting, chasing, exploding - 10/10. And there is a little drama, just perfect amount. I won't be talking about plot.

Washington is undercover DEA agent Bobby Trench and Wahlberg is naval intelligence officer Stig Stigman who is undercover as well; they're both working together to try and rob a powerful drug lord. Simple? Well, not entirely, mainly because each one doesn't know that the other is also working undercover. This is just the beginning of the complications and twists that they are about to face in this thrill ride.Negatives: The movie has a few clichés here and there, as well as action scenes that aren't really new in any way and in general just feel quite lacking.Positives: Small twists and turns in the plot will keep you guessing for a while, but what really makes this movie worth it is the chemistry. The W duo are just excellent together, their interactions seem genuine and are delivered in a way that is quite satisfying to watch, especially from Wahlberg's side. Also Washington's undercover character was superb, I believe everyone met or knows someone who is like him.This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, so for you to enjoy it you must lighten up, grab a couple of friends, some popcorn and watch the film zip away with it's fun flair.",2 Guns

There's crooked internal stuff happening of course, which leaves them relying on each other to figure out how to clear their names and get the bad guys all at the same time.

Don't often have the opportunity to go to theaters, as much as I'd like to. And when I do go to a theater, I'm rather selective. I like my eye candy, good story lines, good acting.This is one of those movies I wish I had seen in theater.My expectations were low for this one, admittedly. Great actors throughout (though Bill Paxton always makes me nervous as he's either hit or miss). But suffice to say, this is one I'd have walked of the theaters of after the end credits rolled with a smile on my face.The chemistry on-screen between Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington is remarkable. Watching this film, one could swear they'd been friends for years. Bill Paxton is Bill Paxton, and thankfully his acting in this film wasn't over-exaggerated as per his norm. Seems he's starting to develop a taste for the serious, and not his usual fluff-pieces, example, True Lies as the fake spy. Other appearances from actors such as Fred Ward (Tremors) and James Marsden (X-Men), was a pleasant surprise. Remaining supporting cast members delivered the goods.The action sequences are very nicely done. Moving at a quick clip and slowing down when needed, just to offer a taste of the intensity of some of the action sequences.The pacing of the movie also moves at a good clip, rarely being a dull moment to be found.Soundtrack, performed in part by Jack White of The White Stripes was solid and suiting for this film, with a decent bass and tone.Much of this movie reminded me of another film, ""The Losers"", starring Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans, pertaining to government double crosses. Unlike ""The Losers"", based off of a DC Comic, the one is based off a graphic novel by Steven Grant.I'm being generous with my rating of this film by giving it a vote of 8 out of 10. Probably should be less for technical merit, but I figure than any film that can keep my attention, and waiting to see how the story plays out, is a great movie in my books.Not all have to be Academy Award winners to be good.

Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.The big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.The movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.These two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.Washington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.Should you or should you not read the comic first?That really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a ""comic book movie."" There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure. I felt as if his character and Wahlberg's were closer in age in the comic. But seeing the two together, it absolutely does not matter. These two made the movie fun.You're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the ""big"" Hollywood movies have been released. This is a movie that gives you a reason to go back to the theaters one more time.It's more than just about Washington and Wahlberg. Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie. Not only is it faithful to the comic, the filmmakers also made sure it had a great cast and delivered a really good quality production.The movie is rated R. Clearly there is quite a bit of violence. There's plenty of shooting, killing and explosions. It gets a little over the top but that's what you should expect from this kind of movie. There is also some brief nudity and plenty of profanity. In other words, this isn't a family film. What it is is a movie you go see with your friends. Buy some popcorn, lean back in your seat and just enjoy the movie and have a great time.I mentioned leaving the theater with a smile. It's not a ""feel good"" movie. But it will make you laugh and give you a good time. That's exactly what I want for my money. It's fun and absurd with over the top action. Do I want a sequel? Boom! Studios did release 3 GUNS this week. I would indeed love to see these two return to the characters.",2 Guns
203,marysusanlocher,Cruel and Disgusting,1,4 August 2013,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This movie was sickeningly cruel; a few scenes in the beginning ruined the entire thing. There was no need for those scenes, and those who have seen the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about. Cruelty to animals, realistic CGI animals or not, is always wrong and having it so graphically portrayed in a movie propagates those actions into society, making what they show more likely to happen in real life. I will never be able to un-see or un-hear those scenes, and if I had known they were in the movie, I wouldn't have gone to see it in the first place. Even if the movie didn't have those sickening scenes, it would have been terrible, with a lackluster plot and various hokey one-liners, which are haphazardly reversed in the end. The makers and actors should be ashamed of themselves for making this movie and putting it into the film industry. Do not see it.",2 Guns
204,creatorsknight,Action and Funny lines... a great guy flick,9,6 August 2013,One of the first things I noticed in the movie was that neither star fit into their normal category of acting. I have seen both of them in a wide range of movies. At times I saw past characters come into play but the characters they played seemed unique. What really made the characters interesting was the way they played together. Oh wow.. it was a good ride. Many of the parts were a little predictable but to tell you the truth I was actually wanting them to be. I wanted to see how these two would handle it. You will be riveted to your seat. You will be smiling at the end of the movie. You would have to hate these two men to come out of the movie and not be entertained. I don't go to a lot of movies. I have a tight budget and there is little wiggle room. When my girlfriend started naming movies we might see. I was expecting to be disappointed again with the list. Then she read this one. I had seen the trailers and I had only really seen them where my attention was drawn away. Then I watched one all the way through and caught the banter between Denzel and Mark. After that I knew I had to see it. I am so glad I spent the money.,2 Guns
205,dtnoga-759-931087,Not Bad just Bland,4,7 August 2013,"100% standard by the numbers buddy flick that wasted the talents of a great actor (Washington) and a very good actor (Walhberg),I couldn't help but think they both counted how much they got paid to read each word of this oh so predictable script.If you want to see chemistry in a buddy flick rent 48 hrs and watch Nolte and Murphy because other than the forced banter in the flat line reading of the script you will not find any in this film.I have to agree with reviewers who said the lame story line was just an excuse to link ridiculous action sequences together.I really can't recall the last time I saw Mr. Washington give such a disinterested and bored performance but Mr Walhberg seemed to be just as bored though I can't blame him.Because of the two stars I had high hopes for this movie but it was not so much bad as it was bland and boring and when it comes to Denzel Washington the last thing I expect is bland and boring.I would have given it a five since it was so 100% average,predictable and vanilla but I subtracted a point for the waste of such good talent.",2 Guns
206,MooTownWillNeverDie,"Great Film, FUN",7,7 October 2013,"Here we have the similarly mismatched team of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, in a mischievously witty ''anti-buddy'' action film. Wahlberg – re teaming with his Contraband director, LA-based Icelandic expiate Baltasar Kormakur – channels his cheeky and chirpy routine to great effect as an undercover US Navy officer, Michael ''Stig'' Stigman. His infinitely wiser sidekick, Robert Trench (Washington), is also undercover, but for the DEA.Neither is initially aware of the other's true identity, as they prepare a drug sting south of the Tex-Mex border while ripping off a bank just north of it. Washington gets to wear prosthetic gold teeth to complete his look. Bill Paxton is also soon on hand to complicate matters, playing a very smooth-talking CIA chief who the Mexican drug cartels are paying off.Based on a series of graphic novels of the same name, 2 Guns features far more artillery than its title suggests. With fond nods to renegade US filmmaker Sam Peckinpah, among others, and with a pointed comment or two about America's ongoing relationship with its southern neighbor (and itself), Kormakur and his merry cast blast their way through an absurdly silly and very funny comedy of errors, as one defense service inadvertently wages war with another, only to be usurped by a third. AdvertisementThe action focuses on a stash of cash that Stig and Trench stole. Aiding and abetting the fun is the ever-alluring Paula Patton as a double-bedding DEA agent, who bares far more than usual, and James Marsden as a navy operative up to no good. Both get the most from roles that would otherwise barely register.All are having a ball. The towering presence of Washington evidently lifts everyone's game a notch or two. The Oscar winner's foray into comedy is an unexpected delight, an all-too rare departure from his usual dramatic leanings. We can but hope this Tex-Mex farce has given him the appetite to do more.",2 Guns
207,ysraf,They are my people,9,28 April 2014,"My first review (You never know what will inspire you).I was surprised to enjoy this movie. In fact, I love this movie. What surprised me was its message and the interaction between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.To me, the message of the movie is ""We CAN be different AND be together"".It breaks my heart as our country gets further torn apart by its leaders who choose to divide us for their own twisted reasons.Mr. Washington and Mr. Wahlberg are so believable in their camaraderie that it gives me hope. Maybe this is the type of relationship on the big screen that could influence, even in some small way, how we connect with each other so that we can finally move forward as a country.I laugh at myself for being so dramatic over a light-weight action movie. But, why not think big.",2 Guns
208,mariaalina-62430,.I really recommend it.,10,6 September 2020,I liked the movie. it also has humor and action..I really recommend it.it's not a work of art but it will really give you a good feeling.,2 Guns
209,boykoot,Good fun,8,9 August 2019,"A self aware, fast paced movie which doesn't feel tiring or like a waste of time. I had good fun watching this. It's no academy award winner, but then again not every big picture has to be. Just a fine movie. Entertaining to watch. Go see it.",2 Guns
