Suffice to say it's one where what you see and hear may not be exactly what is happening....something I like very much in a film. It kept me guessing and only near the end did I really understand much of the story. In addition, the acting was very good and the director did a lovely job setting the mood with the lighting, camera work and music.

1,SnoopyStyle,old creepy Virgil,5,18 February 2015,Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is a high-end antiques dealer and auctioneer. He's in cohorts with Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) in a scam to buy undervalued works. Reclusive heiress Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks) hires Oldman to sell off her possession as she hides in her mansion. He finds some odd mechanical parts in the mansion which Robert (Jim Sturgess) is reassembling.I have a tough time rooting for the coupling of Rush and Hoeks. He is simply so old and such a sleaze. It's very creepy and off-putting. It's ugly and the final twist isn't compelling due to that fact. The movie is well made with good actors. I just don't care about these characters.,The Best Offer
2,kosmasp,Seeing through the offer,7,20 August 2013,"I won't write anything about the ending and while I am only going to suggest things, I still felt I should tag the spoiler box. The premise of the movie is pretty simple and for what it's worth anyone who has seen more than 4 thrillers will know where this is leading up to. It is so obvious that it might actually hurt. But the actors are really good in it and they make it worth while.Of course if you never watched a movie like this and don't care about a movie's title than you might actually be surprised. But even without reading the description of the movie (never do that, so I won't be spoiled major developments in the movie) or anything about it, I could tell you after a couple of minutes where this was leading to. So no points for ""surprising"" ending/twist then. Also it's tough to really completely feel for that particular character, even though he transforms. It's very elaborate but he could/should still have seen through this.",The Best Offer

4,blanche-2,Fantastic,10,4 December 2015,"I've been very fortunate with my Netflix films lately. This one, ""The Best Offer"" from 2013 is a fantastic film with a brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush.Rush plays Virgil Oldman, a well known art expert. He and his friend Billy (Donald Sutherland), a failed artist, have an auction scam going which has helped Virgil acquire a huge art collection of female portraits. When he auctions off paintings he wants, he describes the painting in a way that undervalues it, so that Billy bids and gets it for less than it's worth. Virgil keeps the paintings in a secret room, where he will sit and enjoy them.Virgil receives a call from a reclusive heiress, Claire Ibbetson, who wants the objects in her family home valued and some of them auctioned. She speaks to Virgil, but he never sees her. He then learns that even people who have worked in the house have never seen her. He becomes obsessed with her, an obviously young, fragile, agoraphobic woman. He confides in Robert (Jim Sturgess), a technician who is helping him put together pieces of an automaton he finds in the Ibbetson home; he suspects it might be old and valuable. Virgil admits to having no experience with women at all, and Robert gives him advice.One day, at Robert's suggestion, Virgil pretends to leave, but stays behind to get a glimpse of Claire as she emerges from her room. He is surprised to see that she is not only young, but quite beautiful. His obsession is complete.An intriguing, suspenseful, and sometimes tense film, The Best Offer is fascinating. As the elderly expert, Rush is elegant, erudite, and on the snobby side. Gradually, as he becomes interested in Claire, he softens. Sylvia Hoeks, a Dutch actress, does not look 27 as she is supposed to be (that was the actress' age as well) - but much younger. Her performance is only partially successful, partly because she does not usually act in English. Donald Sutherland is making a new career out of these more eccentric roles, and he pulls them off.Highly recommended for the script, acting, production values, and scenery. A gem.",The Best Offer
5,phd_travel,Absorbing but ultimately lacking - half a Vertigo,5,8 May 2014,"You want to see what happens in this beautifully filmed art world Hitchcock type drama thriller. Geoffrey Rush is good as always as the central character an auction house owner who becomes involved with a mysterious recluse who wants to auction off her family objects. There are parallels with ""Vertigo"" in the older younger obsession and deception but it's lacking the second part. The ""set up"" is obviously coming and not hidden at all. But then the aftermath just leaves the viewer irritated and unsatisfied. Plus the robot is a bit of a nonsense.Overall an absorbing watch but it isn't destined to be remembered as a great movie because of the lacking story. Just watch Vertigo again to see what is wrong with this movie.",The Best Offer
6,gradyharp,"'Emotions are like works of art. They can be forged, they seem just like the original but they are forgery.'",10,18 January 2014,"Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore is highly respected for his films Cinema Paradiso, The Legend of 1900, Malèna, Everybody's Fine, and here he opens a new realm to test his prowess – a story that is so well crafted that even after the film is over the resolution is not entirely clear: he respects his audience too much to make things completely tidy. It is rich in art, music, atmosphere, the underpinnings of the art auction world, phobias and more.Master auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush in a magnificent performance), owner of a vast accumulation of famous paintings of women he hides in a locked room, becomes obsessed with an extremely reclusive heiress Claire (the stunningly beautiful Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks) who collects fine art and is living in a boarded up mansion left to her my her deceased parents. Claire suffers from agoraphobia (fear of strange places) which keeps her confined to her home: her only servant is Lambert (Dermot Crowley) who has never seen her. She refuses to be seen but hires Oldman to perform a valuation of her antiques and paintings and only speaks to him behind closed doors. Oldman has his own phobias: he has a huge selection of gloves he wears at all times, afraid of touching anything without their protection. Oldman also has a scheme with one Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) who attends Oldman's auctions and bids on art in a fashion that allows the two to keep the money private. Oldman also employs a young tinker Robert (Jim Sturgess) and feeds him pieces of mechanical findings from Claire's home: Robert is convinced the pieces when assembled will be an ancient android long lost to history books. Gradually Oldman spies on Claire, falls in love with her despite the enormous difference in their ages, and plans to change his life, and just when it seems their lives will change, the film takes a surprise turn which spins a spell with the audience and cannot be revealed in a review. Nothing is as it seems – so much of life is a forgery.Tornatore is an inordinately sensitive writer and director and has graced this gorgeous film with a musical score (mostly women's voices) by Ennio Morricone. The cast is uniformly brilliant and it is very difficult to understand why this film has not raised a strong following. It is cerebral, intensely romantic, and fascinating on every level. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",The Best Offer
7,deloudelouvain,Welcome to the auction world,7,28 April 2016,"In real life I am a big fan of auctions so watching a movie about an corrupt auctioneer was entertaining. In the beginning I was wondering what the mystery could be in this movie but just before the end I figured it out and it was a nice ending for this movie. The only point I didn't really like about The Best Offer was the duration of the movie. They could have made it a bit shorter and that would not have done any damage to the movie. The main part was for Geoffrey Rush and I thought he did a great job. Even though there is almost no action in the movie you get sucked into the story. The whole cast delivered well, the filming was good. To me it was good entertainment, just a bit too long, but that's the only negative I could say about it.",The Best Offer
8,Buddy-51,Intricate tale of obsession and deceit,8,8 July 2014,"Set in Italy but filmed in English, ""The Best Offer"" is a highly unusual and unusually interesting tale of two lost and hurting souls reaching out to one another for meaning and salvation. Or at least that's what it wants you to THINK it's about. What it's ACTUALLY about may be something else again.A self-described ""old man incapable of love,"" the allegorically named Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) has kept pretty much the entire world - women included - at arm's-length for his entire life. He's a renowned, if not entirely scrupulous, art appraiser and auctioneer who has his entire mode of existence turned upside down when he meets a mysterious young woman named Claire (Silvia Hoeks) who pleads with him to come appraise the belongings in her home upon the death of her wealthy parents. The problem is that Claire, who has been a recluse since the age of 16, seems to be suffering from a severe case of Agoraphobia and will speak with Virgil only through a wall in the house. Dismissive, even irritated at first, Virgil soon becomes obsessed with the faceless, disembodied voice that floats to him through the dusky halls of a lonely villa.Virgil is so emotionally cut off from the world around him that, despite the fact that he is physically able to come and go, he is just as much a prisoner of his life as Claire is of her disease and of the decaying mansion in which she's chosen to entomb herself. Is Claire the unexpected someone who will finally provide that meaningful human connection that Virgil has avoided all this time? Or is she merely the vehicle through which he will finally be made to pay for the many professional transgressions he's committed over the course of his lifetime? Rush carries almost the entire weight of this film on his shoulders, and he certainly shows he has the acting chops to see it through. Since Hoeks is largely off-screen for large portions of the movie, her task is a somewhat less arduous one, though her accomplishment is no less impressive for that. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland are also effective in smaller, yet highly significant, roles in the drama.With a smart screenplay and lyrical direction by Giuseppe Tornatore, ""The Best Offer"" is a haunting, mesmerizing film that draws you into its world and keeps you guessing every step of the way till the big reveal at the end.",The Best Offer
9,paul2001sw-1,Fun and gorgeous isn't always enough,6,29 December 2013,"The con-film has become a staple of cinema: so much so, that it's almost impossible for a film's makers to retain the element of surprise. One solution is to layer con-upon-con, with a sense of knowningness deliberately induced in the audience: we're encouraged to think that something is happening that hasn't yet been revealed, even if we're not sure what. But 'The Best Offer' takes a simpler route: a man explores a path through life that ultimately turns out to be fake. In one sense, there are very few tricks in this plot, just a mirage. But the film needs to give us two things for this to work: firstly, a plausible emotional journey for the victim, and secondly, a sense of motivation for those who plan to rob him. Yet the film's Gothic story is never remotely plausible: it's entertaining as fable, but there's no chance of us being fooled along with the character; or if there is, it's only because we consciously suspend our disbelief as the necessary price of continuing to watch. As for motive, it's simply to steal the money, which is plausible, but dull (compare Bielisnky's marvellous 'Nine Queens' to see a more believable, internally motivated, and cleverer story which nonetheless ends in a similar denouement). The set designer must have had fun on this movie: the story as a whole is jolly but shallow, and it's more of a disappointment than a joy when it's Gothic accoutrements are revealed as sideshow to a fundamentally duller story.",The Best Offer
10,secondtake,"Rush is terrific, and the drama moves from inward to outward at the very end",7,2 December 2015,"The Best Offer (2013)Oddly enough, this is an Italian film, but the main characters speak English. The settings are wonderfully Italian, however, so it's a welcome decision.It's almost a spoiler to say that this is a kind of heist film, or a cleverly tricky film that fools everyone. Luckily the film works for other reasons, mainly the acting of Geoffrey Rush, who has so many eccentricities his life has kind of wound him into a corner. This movie is about his finding his way out.So really it's a touching tale of an older man who loves art, and loves women through art. His room full of portraits of women over the centuries is a treasure trove, and a wonder to see even in a movie. (I wish I had been on the set to just be there—even with reproductions—just to feel the expanse of it.)Rush plays an auctioneer of fine art, Virgil Oldman. The name is Dickensian, and in fact Oldman is a suffering bachelor, single mostly out of his awkwardness everywhere except in front of a crowd with a gavel. So as he is about to retire, his friend (played a bit meekly by Donald Sutherland) talks about all their years loving and collecting (and scamming) art together. And there is this one last mansion that he has to go and assess the art scattered on the walls and floors. The heiress of this broken down mess is even more eccentric than Oldman—she won't go outside, and won't meet visitors. So he does his inventory talking to her through a door. But she seems to respond to his patience and his unusual affinity for her art. In a way this would be a great movie right here—two offbeat individuals who find something in each other as a way to become something more. And that's how it is developed, at first. But is that all there is? You won't know until the end exactly what turns await. Though this cheapened the whole thing a bit, it also makes the movie a big wow and a gasp. Check it out. Superb acting and a steady flow make it work.",The Best Offer

There is basically nothing overly exciting as far as action goes in this but the story and acting really makes you want to keep watching.

13,westsideschl,Automaton,7,4 May 2014,"A film about a reclusive agoraphobic with an immense art collection amongst which is an automaton which is introduced into the film as gradually appearing pieces. Seemingly doesn't fit with the rest of the movie except that our central figure (auctioneer Oldman) is himself an unloved obsessive-compulsive automaton. Anyway, well disguised plot, even though about 80% through I thought ""No, this can't be one of those plot twisters."" which I quickly dismissed as too improbable given the background and challenges to pull it off.Worth five stars for it's creative writing, acting, sets, certainly props and directing (the sound of the dropped painting, the empty room except for ) but reduced for the following: 1. The implausibility of setting it all up without drawing notice; leaving a trace; no witnesses (well, one sort of). 2. The film limiting itself to only our central character's pov thus having an excuse to not have to explain all the immense logistical challenges, time frames and implausibilities. Also, not giving us any background on our other main characters and their outcomes. 3. The automaton appearing each day in pieces scattered about should have set off an alert investigative response from Oldman. Oldman, for his and his partner's intelligence, seemingly do nothing at the end of which there are many possibilities. Too weak! 4. With Oldman's character, even though he steals from people, one is left with either a dismissive feeling toward him or actually pulling for him. Since the victims are not seen and he gets away with it, it's acceptable capitalist look-the-other-way ethics.Spoiler unresolves (read after seeing): 5. An obscure ending - institutionalized with despair-filled reminiscing, or in the café, perhaps, forever waiting. Will the girl come back? Will Billy be laughing? Will the painted representational loves now be replaced by a living love?",The Best Offer

15,Reno-Rangan,Are ready to change yourself when you think you found your match!,8,14 October 2016,"Written and directed by one of the famous Italian filmmaker, Giuseppe Tornatore. An English language film, Geoffrey Rush in the lead. It was about an aging art and antique auctioneer, Virgil. The story reveals his final days in his professional field where he meets a young woman who pursued him for her inherited antiques to put on auction. The woman is very mysterious, because of her medical condition and how they both become so close despite their initial meetings were disastrous is the remaining film to tell us with a twist in the final.It was an awesome storytelling. The screenplay was the top notch and the matching background score. Especially when the story ends and credits rolls up, all those memories from the film keeps us fresh with that music. The music won several awards for the film. I liked the story, but towards the end, I kind of predicted almost everything. That did not stop me, so I enjoyed it thoroughly. Particularly the theme of the film, which I think a bit fresh, and I liked the conclusion as well, but I feel it should have been different or more to it. The way it ended might disappoint some people, but still it is very smart.Everybody was good, but it was Geoffrey Rush, who stole the show with his stellar performance. Three years might be a little late, but it's never too late to watch a fine film like this. One of the best suspense films from the recent time, it is a must see, particularly if you are seeking a good entertainment. So I hope you watch it if you're not yet.8/10",The Best Offer

17,filipemanuelneto,Extraordinary,8,20 March 2021,"I am not a connoisseur of Italian cinema, but I was attracted to this film because it deals with works of art. And I am glad that I dedicated my time to it, as I discovered a truly remarkable film. The story centers on the figure of Virgil Oldman, auctioneer and collector, misanthropic and maniac who, suddenly, is contacted by a mysterious heiress, eager to evaluate and eventually auction off all the valuable stuff in his family home. It turns out that she suffers from a severe agoraphobia, so she never leaves the house nor lets herself be seen by anyone, a fact that leaves Oldman more and more fascinated. At the same time, the old auctioneer finds a series of mechanical pieces in the house, which he thinks belong to a disappeared baroque automaton that, if recovered, would have an absurdly high value.Everything seems clear and transparent in this film, brilliantly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore... but the film dextrously hides its secrets and is not as predictable as it seems, although it is left to guess, as the end approaches. For the puritans, it may shock thanks to the lustful and obsessive passion allowed by the old man for a woman of age to be his daughter, or even granddaughter. But the fact is that Italian filmmakers address this type of passion quite a lot in their films and the story works wonderfully. In the background, there is a sub-plot involving a baroque automaton and the lack of scruples of an art collector, who is interested in buying valuable works at prices well below the value.Geoffrey Rush is a veteran actor and excels in the role of the auctioneer. He knows how to be cool and aloof, arrogant and elegantly hieratic, and manages to gradually deconstruct it as the character's feelings change. It is worth watching this film to see the extraordinary work of this actor. Beside him, the young Sylvia Hoeks, whom I did not know and is excellent, in a complex role that requires a lot of voice work (she does not appear for a considerable time, and we only heard her voice) and a beautiful face. In the dim light, the equally hardened Donald Sutherland is impeccable in a supporting role. Jim Sturgess also does a remarkable job.Technically, it is an equally very good film. Although it is discreet, and allows the story and actors to have space to stand out, the interest in production values is high, starting with a magnificent cinematography, guided by Flavio Zamarion. With an artist's eye, he knew how to make the most of the beauty of the paintings and works of art, as well as the grandeur of the scenery, the filming locations, the landscapes, and create a film where visual beauty abounds and fills the eye. Light and color also work very well, giving the film an additional elegance. The choice of filming locations and works of art that were used in the film was, in a word, judicious, and the soundtrack, signed by master Ennio Morricone, is truly one of the best he has composed in recent times.",The Best Offer
18,l_rawjalaurence,Uncompromising Study of Loneliness,8,10 September 2014,"Giuseppe Tornatore's film is basically a heist movie in which affluent auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is systematically fleeced of his precious art collection by means of an elaborate plot involving impersonation, scientific mumbo-jumbo and a great deal of thoroughly convincing play-acting from Oldman's so-called 'friends' such as Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland).Thematically speaking, THE BEST OFFER is a study in alienation. Despite his success in his chosen career, Oldman cannot bear to get close to anything or anyone. He wears leather gloves to touch the objects he so obviously values, and finds it difficult to communicate with everyone - even his close friends. He spends much of his time sat among his pictures, which occupy almost all of the wall-space in his strongroom, their faces gazing down impassively on him. All the pictures are of women of various cultures and ages; for Oldman they are his friends, even though none of them can respond to him. When he finally gets to communicating with a real woman, the elusive Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), he does so through a locked door - an appropriate visual metaphor for his personality defects.When Claire deigns to appear in front of him, Oldman cannot do much other than to gaze at her in scopophilic fashion, almost as if he wants to possess rather than love her. There are several sequences in the film where he shown staring at her clothes, her hair, and her naked form, as if she were one of the art-treasures he spends much of his life trying to value and collect. Director Tomatore does not want us to sympathize with him; rather he represents Oldman as someone so in love with himself (and his status as a high-society auctioneer) that he never stops to consider his personal life.The film ends with a long shot of Oldman sitting alone in a Prague café, ordering food and drink and waiting for someone who never comes. The camera tracks backwards, showing several couples left and right happily talking to one another, but focusing intently on Oldman's impassive face. He is doomed to live a life of perpetual loneliness, something for which he is almost entirely responsible.Geoffrey Rush gives a memorable performance in a difficult role. Tomatore's camera focuses intently on his features in close-up, looking at every blink of the eye, or curve of the mouth. For a lot of the time his face remains impassive, as if trying desperately to sustain the sang-froid he believes should be characteristic of someone in his profession. We only understand the emotion lurking underneath through the blink of an eye, or the slightly longer glance at the door separating himself from Claire, or the lift of the head as he tries to listen intently to what she has to say. The strain becomes too great for him; in a climactic sequence taking place during an auction, Oldman, his tie awry, his hair uncombed and his suit disheveled, tries desperately to continue the bidding while answering several calls on his cell phone. Eventually the task proves too much for him, and he ends up giving the wrong description for one of the lots he is selling, much to the buyers' amusement. His humiliation is complete - although he continues in his chosen career, he can never do so with the same degree of self-assurance as he had before.Fabio Zamaron's lush cinematography captures the world of antiques; its obsession with surfaces, period detail and (most importantly - money. Everyone is out to cheat their rivals - and their customers - and are prepared to go to any lengths to do so. In this kind of environment human emotions count for little; anyone wanting to find out something has to conceal themselves, either by role-playing or hiding behind ancient artifacts so that no one notices them. Anyone watching THE LAST OFFER would be immediately skeptical if they listened to the valuers pronouncing judgment on popular television programs such as THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW.",The Best Offer

They can be forged they seem just like the original but they are forgery.""The Best Offer is Giuseppe Tornatore's latest film which also happens to be his first one in English. The Italian director will forever be known for his love letter to cinema in 1988 when he directed Cinema Paradiso, a true homage to film. He is a talented filmmaker who seems to always be in control of his craft. The Best Offer may not be a masterpiece, and will probably be forgotten amongst his filmography, but it is a very good thriller with a strong performance from Geoffrey Rush in the lead role. Somehow despite knowing exactly where the film was heading halfway through the movie, it still kept me interested and the 131 minutes went by really fast thanks to great pacing. The story is rather predictable and the film is far from being groundbreaking, but the art direction is so beautiful that it is simply a film to admire. Just like the many art paintings we see in this movie, you don't get tired of watching the story unravel. It's an elegant film and the score by Ennio Morricone just make the experience a more pleasant one. Tornatore delivers a good thriller which thanks to his craft allows you to enjoy it despite all the flaws.Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is an art auctioneer who lives on his own and has gathered quite a large collection of portraits. He tries to stay away from human relationships and keeps to himself. He also happens to be an antiques expert so he knows the value these things have. One day he receives a phone call from a strange woman named Claire (Sylvia Hoeks) who wants him to oversee the valuation of her family's art collection. Hesitant at first due to the fact that Claire never shows up to the meetings, he decides to go along with it when he discovers some pieces from a valuable antique. He takes the pieces to a mechanic named Robert (Jim Sturgess) who tells him he can rebuild the robot if he continues to bring him more pieces. Virgil becomes attached to Claire when he discovers she's even more emotionally damaged than he is. She doesn't allow anyone to see her and hasn't left her house for years. Virgil's life changes when he finally allows himself to become attached to Claire and help her overcome her fear.Halfway through the film there is a conversation between Rush and Donald Sutherland's characters that gives away the ending, but thanks to Rush's strong performance we are still drawn to the film. The rest of the cast isn't as strong as he is, but the movie works nonetheless. If the film had been made a few decades ago then I might have enjoyed the twist, but by now we have come to expect these sort of surprise endings. The Best Offer reminded me a lot of Matchstick Men, but perhaps nearly not as good. The film is still worth a watch thanks to Tornatore's elegant direction. I enjoyed it quite a bit.",The Best Offer

Virgil finds that the more time he spends with Claire, the more obsessed he becomes with and starts to develop strong feelings for her through the passage of time.The first time I watched this film I was a little put off by it - the first 20 minutes or so were a bit 'pompous' and for this reason I didn't pay much attention to what was going on at the start. However, once the story got going I found it really engaging and enjoyable. Knowing that it was mostly a good film I decided to watch it again from the start and can now safely say that it really is a great film.Deception (or The Best Offer as I believe it is otherwise known) has a bit of a Hitchcockian feel to it and early on it teases the audience by wrapping us up in Virgil's world; in the early stages of the film Virgil sees Claire as a pest and Virgil's initial involvement with Claire is purely business. However, the more he speaks to Claire the more fascinated and obsessed he becomes with her - this is due in part to Claire's natural ability to manipulate Virgil and in part to Robert's pep talks which essentially fill Virgil's head with false hope which ends up drawing him closer to Claire. The film plays out as a love story for most of its running time (one of unrequited love in the end), but it's one that Tornatore handles with such sensitivity and care that it's actually a romance that you want to believe in.Rush is a big key to the film's success and pitches his character perfectly here; he's a pompous, selfish, and shallow individual at the start and shifts his character to being more caring and selfless in the latter stages. Rush was excellent and believable at every stage of the narrative and his superb performance reflected the good writing and strong character development that was afforded to him. Sylvia Hoeks was also excellent and again gave a believable performance as a meek agoraphobic woman.The only real weakness with the film is that aspects of the plot are a tad predictable - I sussed out fairly early on that Claire wasn't agoraphobic and it doesn't take much brainpower to work out that Virgil is being scammed all along.Despite the fact that some aspects of the story are predictable, this is still an engaging story that is well-played out and one that also offers strong performances from Rush and Hoeks. It's a wonderful film and I'm glad that I gave it a second chance.",The Best Offer
21,arthur_tafero,Masterpiece of Sting: The Best Offer (La Migliore Offerta),9,13 December 2018,"There is a saying ""Better to Have Loved and Lost Than to Never Have Loved At All"". I used to believe in that saying, but after seeing this film, I am not so sure that this principle holds true for every person. Sometimes, it is better not to have loved at all. Mr. Oldman is a perfect example. This is not the electric Gary Oldman, the very fine actor, this is an old man. A rich, eccentric, art dealer, who has an eye for a hustle whenever he can get over on an unsuspecting seller. Under the veneer of a highly respected auctioneer and art dealer, lies bare the true soul of a man who makes Silas Marner look like a philanthropist. His greed is exceeded only by King Midas. His loveless, soulless life is interrupted by a beautiful woman with a minor estate and art possessions, whom he falls in love with. The ensuing elaborate hustle, in my opinion, is the best in cinematic history.
""The Sting"" with Paul Newman was good, but is Disneyland compared to this film. "" The Red Violin"" was an elaborate hustle film that was superior to ""The Sting"" and even better than ""House of Games"", my favorite hustle film of all time until ""The Red Violin"". This film even tops ""The Red Violin"" as a hustle film, although it falls one star short of the ten I gave both ""The Red Violin"" and ""House of Games"" because the ensemble acting in both of those films was a bit superior to the very good job done by Geoffrey Rush, Donald Sutherland, and the supporting cast. It is interesting to note that my favorite film of all time, ""Cinema Paradiso"", was directed by Tornatore, the same person who directed this film, and the music score, which is outstanding, is also done by Ennio Morricone, the same person who wrote the best musical score ever for a film in ""Cinema Paradiso"". With those two aces as your hole cards, you have a great chance to win the hand. Tornatore is one of the best directors in history, and Morricone is one of the best musical composers for film in history. This is a must-see film for any serious film buff.",The Best Offer

Not once a look of glee on his face, or a spring in his step. Dialogue didn't help because he kept speaking in formal terms, and the middle part seemed a bit ho-hum. The rest of the cast were playing symbolic roles, and the princess in the tower was too pretty even for an Old Man to be fooled.There were a lot of heavy lines, like marriage being a state in which you're never sure yours is the best offer. I did like, ""Celibacy is the worst sexual perversion"".So I felt the emphasis was wrong, that the others should have had greater roles, that it needed more humour.

It surprises me that he was only in his early 30s when he directed it as the film already showed the work of an expert, given that his other films aren't as notable. The Best Offer, with its tight screenplay, lush sets, brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush and beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, also exemplifies the sophisticated expertise filmmaking. It's refreshing to see a film with a unique universe grounded in the culture of our own with some bizarrely specific themes. While my only complaint is that the dialogue has this very ""written"" quality about it that is near impossible to deliver in a natural way, it's at least consistent throughout.The story is constantly intriguing, held together by a Hitchcockian mystery feeling, and always pays off in a unique way. I'm not one for ""old man and young girl romance"" stories as they're rarely without uncomfortable perversion but The Best Offer completely justifies it with its well developed characters and themes. However, what makes this film so special and strange is the dramatic turn in the third act. Heartbreaking not only for the characters but for the audience that the film changes so drastically. But this is what made the film stick with me so much. It's wonderful to have a film that you toss and turn in your head, trying to figure out what it's all about.

29,tomsview,Intriguing offering,8,25 September 2015,"""The Best Offer"" is an unusual, stylish movie with a clever story.From the beginning we sense there is a mystery at its heart, and indeed, it keeps you wondering right to the end.I wouldn't give away too much of the plot and spoil the enjoyment for anyone discovering it for the first time, however there are other things to enjoy about ""The Best Offer"" other than the twists and turns of the story.Geoffrey Rush plays Virgil Oldman, a successful art connoisseur and auctioneer who is asked to evaluate and sell the estate of Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), a reclusive young heiress who has not left her home for years. Virgil is a man of epicurean taste, who also has some carefully guarded issues regarding his near worship of beautiful women, which has manifested itself in an impressive private collection of paintings of women through the ages.As he begins to catalogue the Ibbetson estate, we realise that the artefacts he uncovers and the growing relationship with his strange young client touch not only his vanities but also probe his phobias and fantasies.This is a film of many layers. We get an insider view of a world of wealth, privilege and a taste, but we also get an intimate look at Virgil Oldman; we see beyond the aloof, cool exterior to the man of deeply repressed vulnerabilities - it is a thoughtful performance by Geoffrey Rush.There is a great deal of artwork shown in the film including a couple of portraits by a fictional artist named Jansky, supposedly of great value, and important to the plot. Paintings that receive great reverence in movies are sometimes a bit of a let down when they appear on the screen, often being simply retouched photos (""Laura"") or just badly executed works that show the producers had little taste or knowledge of art.That is not the case here, the filmmakers obviously went to some trouble to commission paintings from a very good artist (Russian artist Katerina Panikakova according to one source) and the interesting-looking portraits fit perfectly into the superb look and feel of the whole film.""The Best Offer"" is an Italian production, and the love of art and beauty lends an Italian sensibility to the whole thing. Adding to the atmosphere is the distinctive Ennio Morricone score.Although the Mamet-esque ending brings the drama to a logical enough conclusion, like many films, the journey is the most satisfying aspect of ""The Best Offer"" - even if, sadly, it only reinforces the notion that there is no fool like an old fool.",The Best Offer
30,krocheav,Conned Again,4,1 May 2014,"Here we go round a familiar theme one more time. As with Writer/Director Giuseppe Tornatore's earlier film ""The Legend of 1900"" we again have largely overblown characters in unbelievable situations. In both these offerings, we have characters that similarly, for one reason or another, have supposedly never been completely part of the 'real' world. What is it that makes some audiences so ready to accept a movie as 'great', simply because it looks visually stylish? Pour enough money into a limp idea, and it can look way better than it actually is. 'The Best Offer' primarily comes across as style over substance. The strongest aspect of this film is it's 'look'. Cinematographer Fabio Zamarion works hard to achieve above average nuances under Tornatore's call, and this, coupled with terrific production design and set decoration wins handsomely. It's just a pity they've been saddled with a script that stretches all believability till it cracks under the strain. If these stories are expected to be taken as fables, then why are they given such deadly serious treatments, taking them into the 'realistic' realm?Geoffrey Rush's character Virgil, is a man of long term 'set' habits --obsessive compulsive to the extreme-- (wont touch anything without gloves, avoids eye contact wherever possible) yet within a few weeks we're expected to believe his near complete turn around. Off come the gloves, he's now even primed to have raucous sex with a girl more than half his 60+ years. This might have been OK if it were the only trait we had to overlook, but the story features so many outlandish situations that if you pause, just slightly, to ponder them ~ you realize it's as fake as some of the art works this critic --of world renown-- is supposed to be able to recognize. Rush is such a professional he almost pulls it off (but I wouldn't be surprised if he wished he could have re-written some sections) Unfortunately, relationships between many characters throughout this work also stretch credibility, with way too much left unexplained. Still, if you like movies that have been treated to an expensive 'arty' look, have outlandish situations (complete with large plot holes) then you could easily see this as a favorite.Ennio Morricone's music score is complex and quite sophisticated, but as a collector of his work, I found it musically rather unmemorable.

33,classicalsteve,Underrated Art-World Mystery Romance Is Slow-Paced But Mesmerizing,9,13 December 2015,"You have to appreciate not only certain kinds of films but certain kinds of art to be enamored with ""The Best Offer"". Like a renaissance portrait which needs to be slowly contemplated over a period of time to understand, ""The Best Offer"" is a rather slow-moving but atmospheric mystery-romance where all the pieces don't fall into place until the very end. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding in a tour-de-force performance along with a solid cast to match, including Donald Sutherland and the young Sylvia Hoeks. The film bombed in the United States and did only modestly well in Europe to regain back its $20 million budge. That said, this may be a film which will discover an audience in years to come.Virgil Oldman (Rush) owns a prestigious art auction house in an unnamed city in Europe. His house obtains some of the best works to be sold for the best clients to bidders who have more disposal cash than many cities around the world, not to mention entire countries. In addition to his outward standing as a respected art auctioneer, Oldman has a secret obsession. He loves portraits of women from all artistic eras, from the Early Renaissance to the early 20th century. However, some of the paintings he covets would be too expensive for him to buy, assuming they are evaluated correctly, and a few of them come into his auction house.In auction parlance, ""the best offer"" refers to the bidding scenario for an art object or artifact which has no reserve. In other words, no matter how low the highest bid received, the bidder will win the item regardless, be it $20,000 or $200, the minimum being only the announced opening bid. By contrast, in a reserve auction, bidders must meet a designated reserve price on an item so designated else the item will not be sold. To obtain paintings for his private collection that even he wouldn't be able to afford, Oldman has a side scam with his friend Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland), a competent painter who lacks artistic vision. When a multi-million-euro portrait painting comes into the action which Oldman desires for his collection, he misevaluates the painting as being not the work of a true master but only a lesser artist from the same period, meaning it would be worth only a fraction. The lot then comes up during one of his auctions, and he announces ""best offer"" before starting the bidding very low. Unbeknownst to the clients and the bidders, Whistler's task is to bid on and win the designated painting Oldman desires for his private collection. Whistler then in turn, sells the painting back to Oldman for a nice profit, and the auctioneer places his new acquisition in a secret room filled portraits of women from the ages. Essentially, Oldman has defrauded those consignors depending upon him for a fair evulation of their works. We eventually learn early on that Oldman and Whistler have been playing this game a long time.Then Oldman and the auction house receive a strange phone call. A woman named Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks) claiming to have a huge collection of art, paintings, artifacts and books in a large old house desires Oldman and his auction business to sell off the items. They make arrangements to meet and settle the terms of the auction-sale, but she always misses the appointment, often claiming car accidents. For about the first 50-60% of the film, we only hear Claire's voice but we never see her. Eventually, Oldman learns she's a young woman heiress having lived in her house, an old-style Italian villa, maybe circa the 19th-century, for many years after her parents died. She refuses to be seen because she suffers from agoraphobia, the fear of social situations and open-spaced environments. She stays in a tiny room within a room inside the large house.At first Oldman is put off by the situation but eventually becomes intrigued both by the art and artifacts in the house and Clarie's psychological illness. He also finds strange pieces of gears throughout the house, and he brings them to a mechanics specialist, Robert, who determines they are from an 18th century automaton which was used to tell fortunes in the 18th century. Oldman decides to bring the pieces to him to reconstruct the automaton. As the story progresses, not only does Oldman wish to auction off the artwork and artifacts, he wants to see Claire in person. He, in short, begins to fall in love with her.This is a very interesting film, and highly original. It is slow-paced, and even around 2/3rds through it I became a bit impatient and wanted it to pick up the pace. Eventually it does, and the last quarter of the film is worth the initial three quarters. Rush is outstanding as the aloof and austere auctioneer who begins to come out of his shell because of Claire. Sylvia Hoeks is also outstanding as the heiress-recluse who at first is distrustful of Oldman but eventually begins not only to trust but even like him. While this film is not for all tastes, if you like art and slow-paced mystery, this film is quite compelling.",The Best Offer
34,petra_ste,Locked doors,6,23 July 2014,"For the first time I have a mixed reaction to Tornatore, whose movies I usually either admire (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, La Leggenda del Pianista sull'Oceano, La Sconosciuta) or detest (Malèna, L'Uomo delle Stelle). La Migliore Offerta is adequate, but anodyne: premise is more intriguing than execution. Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is a wealthy, successful art expert, but his personal life is dreary. When he receives a surprise birthday present he cringes with alarm and irritation like Harry Caul in Coppola's The Conversation; he spends his evenings staring at his treasured collection of female portraits. Virgil is hired by elusive Claire (Sylvia Hoeks) to evaluate her possessions in a dilapidated mansion, but the young woman is agoraphobic and refuses to interact with him directly. Virgil's curiosity soon turns into an obsession, as he starts spying on her and then tries to befriend her.Rush's portrayal is competent but saddled with a simplistic script. Most of Tornatore's filmography deals with emotionally closed-off individuals (both teens and adults), but Virgil's arc doesn't always strike the right notes. In particular, his easy relationship with a young repairer (Jim Sturgess) who becomes his love confidant, no matter how important for the last act, is difficult to buy; their expository chats feel awkward and bring the movie to a grinding halt.I can think of different directions the screenplay could have taken. 1) Make it darker, with a more twisted love story (think Vertigo) -instead, beneath his cold facade, Virgil is essentially a necktie-wearing teddy bear. 2) Emphasize the giallo / mystery element. 3) Cut a good chunk of dialogues and go for a moody, mostly silent piece, allowing Rush to act more with his eyes and body language. What we have here is a character study, interesting but not particularly subtle - and its conclusion feels contrived. MAJOR SPOILERS The heist appears unnecessarily complicated: while Virgil is a socially dysfunctional man, he isn't on the level of, say, Nicolas Cage in Matchstick Men - one gets the sense a more straightforward approach would have saved the con-men a huge amount of time and money, with half the possible pitfalls.A stronger but unknown drama with a similar premise (lonely art dealer with a bleak personal life and an obsession) is the underrated Come Due Coccodrilli.6/10",The Best Offer
35,spookyrat1,Attractive Looking Forgery!,5,12 February 2020,"Staggered that this very handsome looking, but deadly dull production, supposedly masquerading as some sort of thriller, has seen fit to be granted an IMDB rating of a whopping 7.8 by some 100000 members. I have to say I totally agree with the Metacritic rating of 49%. This time the critics nailed it.As befits a film with a narrative immersed in high end European art, The Best Offer looks great and director/writer Giuseppe Tornatore and cinematographer Fabio Zamarion ensure art aficionados get plenty of opportunities to drool over the many canvases that are seen throughout this overlong movie. Unfortunately however Tornatore presents an elongated storyline that over features a rather unsympathetic protagonist with the pretentiously symbolistic name of Virgil Oldman. Oldman played by a very good (it should be added) Geoffrey Rush is just about in every scene of the movie. The problem is that he's not the sort of character with whom, I believe, audiences want to spend almost 135 minutes, despite Rush giving it his best shot. At any rate by the time the film was halfway through, I'd pretty much had my fill of the OCD - ridden, supercilious art expert come auctioneer, Oldman.The other leads have their moments, but are generally hamstrung, by the circumstances of the frankly unbelievable storyline, that demands the audience accept an excessive number of contrivances. Jim Sturgess is Robert, a very convenient tinkerer and mechanical repairman, who virtually disappears in the third act. On the other hand Sylvia Hoeks is Claire Ibbetson, a reclusive heiress, who for much of the movie we only annoyingly hear, rather than see. Finally, there is the criminally underused and barely seen Donald Sutherland, who plays Billy Whistler, an artist and maybe friend of Virgil's who helps him at auctions.Along the way occurs a fairly predictable heist, which we don't see as it occurs offscreen ... because it's meant to be a twist, that Blind Freddie could see coming. And then after what we think is the denouement, we get another 15 or 20 minutes of an unneeded Virgil moping around, to help us clear up any loose ends and deal us out some more redundant exposition.Even a more sleekly-edited, shorter Best Offer may have only been a marginally better film.

37,Likes_Ninjas90,Very dense but mesmerising thriller,8,27 August 2013,"Geoffrey Rush's layered, dominant performance is the thematic and emotional crux of this very dense but mesmerising thriller. In one of his best performances, he plays his character Virgil Oldman with theatrical notes, making the auctioneer an impatient and callous man, who is suffering from rhypophobia. His antisocial behaviour and general disregard of other people signposts this as being a story about a man who learns to reconnect with people and to become a better person. Throughout the film Virgil does attempt to reconnect with the world by aiding an unseen woman named Claire (Sylvia Hoeks), who communicates with him through a wall as he helps her value the property of family belongings. This is a mere starting point as the rabbit hole of the narrative is far deeper.There is a distinct European temperament to the material, courtesy of Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso), whose deliberate pacing of the story provides the narrative with time and spatiality to enhance the themes and characters. The central relationship between Virgil and the mysterious Claire has a fascinating basis, not because of what it provides Virgil, but how it challenges him. Who is this woman and why is she hiding? The suspense is Hitchcock in tone because we're intrigued by what we're not seeing off camera as much as Virgil's delicate actions. This mystery is trumped by story beats that dissolve into intense peaks of voyeurism, enhanced by a Roman Polanski inspired feel for claustrophobic interiors.Virgil is a terrific character. As an art expert he has an eye for detail that provides with him the investigative senses of a detective. Watch his intensity increase as he talks to Claire on his mobile phone, hearing the echo of noises around him and through the phone. He knows that she must be nearby. Their relationship is rich with irony, a bond drawn from an aversion to sociality and people themselves. Tornatore's handsome interior stylisations reflect the internal psychology of his lead character. Scenes are filmed with a wide angle lens, positioning Virgil as a smaller figure in the middle of large open room. This asserts his emotional distance and failure to understand people, women in particular. As he grows mentally and physically closer to Claire and the wall that hides her, the framing is purposefully tighter to assert their union of agoraphobic tendencies. Additional glimpses of his home life reveal a highly desaturated, untouched and sterilised living quarters.Cleverly, the film's tension levels are spread outside the main story and into two subplots that enhance the complexity of the relationships and the overall plotting. Virgil has two associates with vastly different motives. The first is his friend Billy (Donald Sutherland) who schemes with him on auctions. Virgil conducts the auction, while Billy sneaks in a deliberate final bid. The other man is Robert (Jim Sturgess), who works in a workshop with mechanics parts. Robert forms an unexpected second mystery in the script. As Virgil asks him for advice on women and subsequently how he can grow closer to the Claire, Robert's inner life comes to the fore. He is continually surrounded by various women when he is meant to be in a relationship. If his advice is genuine, why is his personal life such a mess and what is the significance of the robot that he is constructing from various cranks found around Claire's family mansion?One of the theories Robert questions about the robot is whether there was someone once manipulating it from the inside. The same can be said about Virgil because of the artificiality of his life and the manipulation that occurs between these characters. One of the key lines in the film is ""there is always something authentic concealed in every forgery"". Deception becomes Tornatore's concluding theme, along with physical and mental disorientation. The idea is that as Virgil loses his bearings on time and space we do too so that we experience indistinguishable emotions about the real and fake. On top of this is a midget character with a photographic memory and a fast tracked timeline, which makes for a confusing, mind-bending last quarter. I am still not entirely surely what happened but films that let you guess the ending by the second act are stale and boring. This will provoke discussion, not only because it's strange and ambiguous but because of the complexity of the writing and the various layers of the inspired central performance.",The Best Offer

Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Oldman is so fragile, and tortured, and does such a great job of making you feel his character's deepest feelings, and fears. You can see that this all has so much meaning, and has come at a time in his life when he needed it the most. I loved the characters in this movie, including the inanimate. The look, and feel of Oldman's possessions is so perfect, and that floor is a dream. I Enjoyed this movie for all of those reasons, but so much more.

Together with an accomplice, Billy (Donald Sutherland), posing as a bidder at these auctions, they are able to underbid for items that he knows to have much more infinite value.

Virgil is a recluse, always dining alone, cold, all business and a sterling professional.Enter Clair Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), a woman who contacts Virgil directly to assume responsibility for her estate that she wishes to auction off. The only problem is that she suffers from agoraphobia, and as a result, she has locked herself behind a hidden door within her villa and hasn't set foot outside in the real world in years. Nobody has seen her face, and when she speaks to Virgil, it is either by phone, or literally with a wall between them.As they get to know each other, their walls begin to come down. Her literal one, and his figurative one. Two recluses who find comfort, trust and eventually love, but only with and for each other. But there is so much more than that waiting on the horizon for Virgil as this unlikely relationship comes to a dramatic conclusion.This film is multi-faceted and presented in many layers. I was torn with this film because it was made so very well, with insight, very good acting, cinematography, pacing and strong characterization. I loved it ... until the end. I personally loathed the ending, but then I realized it was because of how I felt toward the characters. It was almost as if this whole story and its consequences had happened to me. That is effective film making. Can I in good conscience give it a bad rating because I didn't like the ending? Most movies, no problem. But for some reason, this one spoke to me. I will more than likely ponder over this one for days to come yet. That to me IS a good movie, despite my grievances.Since I want to maintain a spoiler free review here, I won't mention the title of the movie, but Nicolas Cage starred in a film back in the early 2000's with a very similar story and with a very similar ending. I personally loved that movie. But that one gave us some more closure, making it easier to digest. This one ... no. We are left feeling just as Virgil does. Whether you consider that to be a good ending or not, I'll leave up to you.",The Best Offer
40,christophe92300,Solid but could have been much better with few adjustments,7,3 August 2014,"With The Best Offer, Giuseppe Tornatore delivers a cruel story, the ultimate vengeance of a men (Billy) against his long-time, auctioneer « friend » (Virgil), a highly bitter and despising character who never believed in him and constantly put him down in regards to his artistic level.The expert's psychology is perfect and because he is gradually endearing as minutes go, this makes the revenge even more cruel, too bad the other characters aren't as dense.Other weak point : the scenario is very redundant, all those back-and-forth at the mansion, though necessary for the devilish, implacable plan, turn out to be a bit too heavy, a few more ellipses wouldn't have been superfluous.You could also regret that Tornatore gave too many hints throughout the movie on the final twist, which therefore could have had a lot more impact.The Best Offer remains nonetheless a solid movie, but with a few adjustments, it could have been much better.",The Best Offer

Literally nothing and no one is to be overlooked.It both benefits from and loses potential greatness by not dealing with any big issues. The story was setting up and would have made sense as science-fiction, but it takes a more mysterious route. I would have preferred a more sci-fi route, but appreciate the views found here too.There are plenty of ongoing twists and surprises throughout, including the acting performances. Even the occasional automaton Donald Sutherland fits the more relaxed role he plays perfectly. All of it is underscored by a never cliché or overused soundtrack/score.",The Best Offer
44,shawneofthedead,"A troubled but worthy study of character and relationships, mixing love and lies in the same oddly powerful breath.",7,2 April 2014,"There's something ripe and a little foreign about The Best Offer - a romantic drama laced through with a dark psychological mystery that never really seems to settle into itself. The film's mix of disparate genres, odd ideas and overblown language should add up to something considerably more awkward. And yet, there's something incredibly compelling about Giuseppe Tornatore's film.Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is a top auctioneer with an impeccable eye and an impressive secret stash of art - unable to really connect with other people, he prefers instead to collect priceless portraits of women with the help of his partner-in-not-quite-crime Billy (Donald Sutherland). His solitary existence is interrupted by the severely agoraphobic Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), a wealthy heiress who must sell her parents' art and antiques to survive but can hardly bear to step out of her tiny, hidden suite of rooms in the family mansion. The lonely, difficult Virgil finds himself increasingly drawn to the mystery and charm of this girl he can't see, a dilemma he can only share with playboy mechanic Robert (Jim Sturgess) as the latter works on a possibly priceless automaton found in the dank Ibbetson basement.The Best Offer stumbles quite a few times as it goes on. The discussions between Virgil and Robert about Claire start out innocuously enough, but by the time Robert is giving the elder man lessons in love and wooing, the film feels stilted and strange. Robert's advice is, frankly, pretty terrible, and one assumes that Virgil only takes it because he has so comparatively little personal experience with women as a class and gender. It's hard to buy, at times, some of the twists and turns in Virgil's friendship with Robert.But, on the flip side, the film is a triumph as a study of character and relationships when it comes to Virgil's ability to forge a connection with Claire. This feels real and believable: he segues from righteous anger at her refusal to meet him in person, to a fascination with a woman he can neither touch nor see. For a man so used to avoiding human contact, Claire is, in a sense, as untouchable and easy to admire as a work of art. Their deepening relationship and trust in each other forms the curiously effective bedrock of The Best Offer, one that feels - surprisingly - sweet and emotional rather than creepy and desperate (as it might easily have turned out).Rush is fantastic in the part. He takes the clumsier bits of dialogue in his stride, crafting a character who's tough to like but unexpectedly easy to love. There's a huge reservoir of feeling and longing buried inside this remote, cold man, and Rush makes it possible to buy into his rush of emotion towards Claire. Hoeks, too, does impressive work as the severely damaged Claire, suggesting a sadness in her reclusive illness that breaks down the defences Virgil has crafted around himself for decades.The credibility of Virgil and Claire's oddball relationship is what makes the film's audacious final twist work so well - the narrative reversal breaks the story and characters apart, but in a way that haunts rather than frustrates. It makes the viewer question everything they've accepted about the film, while driving home the dramatic and emotional truth of the connection Virgil managed to find with another person. The final scene of Virgil in a coffee shop is quite possibly one of the most devastating and uplifting moments you'll see in a film this year: it's proof that this apparently terrible, rude man can love, and love with an abandon that can ruin and save him in equal measure.Throughout the film, there are several moments that might give one cause to wonder how it can end in a way that makes sense. The script is rough in patches, and some parts so wilfully strange (take, for example, the tiny mathematical genius who sits in the pub across the road) that it can sometimes feel like a Gothic construction rather than a coherent film. But, give it a chance, and Tornatore will shock and surprise you with the humanity he suffuses into this world of canvas, metal and marble.",The Best Offer

That does not happen much with the movies I watch. Great acting from everyone! If I don't give this movie a ten it is because I kinda did not like the ending... Or, maybe they should have kept the movie linear and not portraying his insanity first and then how he got to be in a pertubated state of mind. Everything can be fake - sums it all for me. And as an artist, I can really understand this and see it on many levels.Why the revenge was actually carried out remains a mystery I guess... His old friend who has always have his trust just robed him of his women that include Cezanne, Renoir, Ingres, Raphael and many many more... ( Though, this is exactly one thing I did not like - though I know it is a fiction and a movie and does not have to correspond to the actual truth - that he had hidden works of art which are known to be in museums ( at least, I know as a lover of art) ).

We do understand that. When the curtain is pulled i wasn't susprised because i already knew kind of a twist was comming - but that's ok. the problem is the rest of the time where tornatore aims to entertain us with the curtain still there. and is mostly becautifully shot angles (some of them not that much), good music (morricone no less than the man) and an actress that is good but i don't think it has that good material to work with.you see the problem here is that first most of the dialogue is meh. rush is better when he doesn't talk - even though he can be a likeable character. the dialogues between him and sturgess are in general bad. the ones with him and Claire are not awesome either, even though they're a bit better. the other characters don't have a lot to work with. second, the movie can be entertaining until a point, but then it's pretty much the same thing all over again - it's geoffrey rush trying to hook up with a girl an getting tips for it - and a lot of general considerations about women that are too whatever. it seems tornatore wants to entertain us while he's building the big reveal, but he doesn't have that much to work with. just small tricks that don't keep you as interested as you should honestly.it's not a bad movie and it has some good things, but it needed better lines, better knowledge on how spend it's time length and mostly it's a bit too pretentious - it wants you to think it's saying a lot of things, but actually not that much. with a direction that is good in general, but actually is more ""the plot is not on point, i'm just filming things to try to keep you entertained, an give you clues here and there"". could be better honestly, even though is not an utterly mess.",The Best Offer
48,gregking4,"a strange mix of drama, psychological suspense and romance",7,22 July 2013,"The first English language feature film from director Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for his marvelous homage to film with Cinema Paradisio, is a strange mix of drama, psychological suspense and romance. It tells the story of Virgil Oldham (played by Geoffrey Rush), an eccentric and unscrupulous art auctioneer who has a scam going with his long time partner in crime Billy (an underused Donald Sutherland). Oldham is able to easily spot fakes, but he also has an eye for deceiving desperate sellers regarding the worth of their forgotten masterpieces. Oldham is vain, cynical, fastidious and emotionally dry, until he is asked to evaluate the furniture of a house being sold. The house belongs to the reclusive, agoraphobic Claire (Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks), who has shut herself off from the world and refuses to emerge from a secret room within the house. Oldham finds himself drawn to help Claire overcome her phobia. The Best Offer moves at a slow, measured pace that slowly draws the audience into its world of deception. Just when we think we have it all figured out, Tornatore manages to pull the rug from under our feet. This is one of those films that almost demands to be seen twice so that you can unravel the puzzle and put the various pieces together. The film has been gorgeously shot on location in Italy, Prague and Vienna by cinematographer Fabio Zamarion (Respiro, etc), and the lush score by Tornatore's regular collaborator Ennio Morricone adds to the atmosphere. Rush delivers a strong performance as a cold and unsympathetic character.

A gifted, but horribly lonely art appraiser is caught up in a romance that's far outside his skill set.(The moral here should be: when you're learning something new don't bite off the big one.)
As a whole it's an intriguing story, full of mystery and beauty. Unfortunately there are facets
that are either stretched beyond believable, or the character is grossly and pathologically lonely and naive .ACTING:
Rush is an exemplary actor, and carries this film. Yes, the rest of the cast does their job, but the lead
pulls the weight of this film. He literally makes this film what it is.TEMPO: Excellent pace throughout as it rises and falls.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Since the subject matter is exquisite art, you can imagine the sheer beauty of this film.It's sort of like being in a museum.DIRECTING: Overall, it was done well. My chief complaint is a common one (for me): when a director is
also the writer it tends to make a film prone to unchecked error. I can't speak to his other work because
he's not an American director and I've never seen his other work. But in this film, my guess is he stretched his
own skill set too far, and it shows in the lacking of plausibility in the story.In sum, an excellent film that could have been better. Rush is the reason it succeeded.",The Best Offer

59,The-Social-Introvert,Curious,8,24 August 2014,"""Everything can be fake: joy, pain, hate, illness, recoveryeven love."" Among the movies of 2013 that I added to my watch-list, The Best Offer remained the most curious one and one that I was eager to see. Though critics didn't think much of it, the film was directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, whose films I always enjoy. More notably, it was scored by the legendary Ennio Morricone! Knowing that my favorite film composer had worked on a mainstream English-language movie for the first time in years was my main reason for watching the film. Whenever I see Morricone's name in an opening credit my ears grow in size.Despite my hatred of trailers (THEY ALWAYS GIVE THE PHACKIN' PLOT AND SPOILERS AWAY!) my curiosity got the better of me and I checked the shorter version out. It told me more than I wanted to know yes but I still felt that this would be a picture worth seeing. Add that to the fact that we got a tease of the music to come. The plot revolved around an auctioneer Virgil Oldman, played by the ever-brilliant Geoffrey Rush, who becomes fixated with an anonymous client Claire who has a ""Strange disease"". Interesting. The Best Offer flows at a majestic pace, revealing little snippets of information to this strange mystery that dominates the screen-time scene by scene. The grandiose atmosphere is beautiful. Often it is created by having the main character in the centre of the frame, while usually in a large set, and with the camera far back. These are blending in well with close up shots of Rush when his emotional state is important to note.Our curiosity of the strange lady mirrors that of the protagonist, who is by no means a great man. Virgil Oldman's love and passion for art is shadowed by the fact that he is pretentious, cold and, alongside his accomplice Billy Whistler, is a fraud. His auctions are in fact cons – when he 'auctions' paintings that he wishes to keep he sends a signal to Billy, who bids for it on his behalf for a reduced price, allowing no- one else to get in. In most cases this plot decision would make an audience dislike the main character, or at least acknowledge the fact that he is a very flawed man. However, I believe his adoration and admiration for art is conveyed so well (Oh, that scene in his secret room! It gave me chills!) that, for me at least, I never saw him as a bad man for this. His actions are certainly wrong, yes, but having been in a position where I most desperately wanted to complete my collection of something (films, if you're wondering) and would do anything to finish it, I understand his mentality.Virgil Oldman is a man whose attachment to paintings seems to have replaced any longing for human contact. He is shown to have no friends (unless you count Billy, and if you've seen the film – you won't), no wife, no familyno-one. And yet he doesn't seem to care. Look at the expression of Rush's face when he is in the painting room – his happiness is conveyed so well. You can tell that he feels no need for human contact, since the paintings are enough for him. It is also interesting to note that his paintings are of females. This suggests that he is afraid of them, afraid of getting close (perhaps he never tried) and would rather admire them from a distance. Or at least he appreciates the beauty and elegance of a woman.There are three other major characters – the previously mentioned Billy Whistler, the young man Robert who works in some kind of technical store, and of course our mystery woman. She is the only character more reclusive than Virgil (Hell, she hasn't been out of the house in 15 years!) which is probably why he was so drawn to her. That and the fact that Virgil finds little pieces oferm, robot bits scattered around the woman's house which are invaluable if put together, which is where the chap at the shop comes in. It is clear from the onset that these piece have been deliberately placed around the lady's home, which only adds to his curiosity.The meat of the film is when Rush draws out Claire from her solitary confinement – sometimes by means that shatters her vital privacy – who in turn reveals many flaws of Virgil to him. Interestingly, he acts on these criticisms, such as when he no longer dyes his hair in order to discontinue lying to himself. As their chemistry strengthens, the mystery of the film weakens. So we know overtime that the peculiar and often scary woman is in fact Agoraphobic and with a fear of people, and Geoffrey Rush's character has finally done something good for another human being. Not only that, he has done good for himself – The Best Offer very civilly develops a romantic tone after the covert feel dissolves, as we spend time with our new couple. He even shows her his private painting room. This is such a touching scene. For a man to expose something so private and dear to him to another human being (especially a man like Virgil) is an extraordinary thing that should not be taken lightly. It is also in this scene that Claire tells Virgil that she will always love him, in case something comes between them. Cough! Cough! This reinforces the fact that there is always a hint of desolation in the brilliant atmosphere Giuseppe Tornatore creates.Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/movie-review- the-best-offer/",The Best Offer

65,Amadio,Almost Hitchcockian - fully engaging,8,8 November 2014,"Geoffrey Rush is a consummate actor, and here he delivers yet another gripping performance. Here, on the surface, an unlikable cheating auctioneer, underneath, a timid paranoid. The film journalises his awakening from semi-recluse to passionate man, yet we are always left with the nagging feeling that all is not as it seems. This is both the strength and weakness of the film; we want to see what happens, and at the same time we know it has to be a set up. Still, it is masterfully delivered. Donald Sutherland's role is minor, and he delivers perfectly the role that has been assigned to him; you know he has something up his sleeve. All the supporting actors do their parts well - but still we are waiting for 'that moment'. With Hitchcock you knew things were going to change, and so with this. But how it is done! After the film is over you can look back and say ""Ah, now I see."" And this is satisfying. The actual material, the story, the substance is only the canvas on which the story is painted. The movement, the feeling, the change could have been delivered in almost any background, but Rush is sterling in his awakening - even though we know trouble is around the corner. This is film-making the old way; character (not FX/action) driven, mood rather than setting, the slow burn rather than the fast explosion.

70,BobbyT24,Like watching a masterpiece -- with less inspiring storyline,7,11 August 2015,"This was like watching Rembrandt painting one of his most beautiful masterpieces... over the charcoal drawing of one of his least-inspiring students. Don't get me wrong. I like the movie. It was stupendous to look at on-screen. It dripped class and elegance. What was missing was a solid, quicker-paced story. The acting was excellent, sets were glorious, the Giuseppe Tornatore direction was well done. It just... dragged on. I can only look at a Van Gogh for so long before I want to move onto another interesting painting. If this movie would have been 30 mins shorter, it would have been a tighter (and better) story.Basic plot (since it's missing oddly from this site?): A virtuoso auctioneer/appraiser of antiquities is commissioned by a mysterious and very wealthy patron who suffers from agoraphobia and cannot leave her dilapidated mansion. What the patron does not realize is the auctioneer also gives less-than-factual value to some artifacts, thus lining his own pockets with the proceeds. Through many, many phone calls and personal visits, the auctioneer starts to discover personal and obsessive feelings for his unseen patron. While speaking with his more worldly and younger mechanic, the auctioneer sets out to woo the patron and finally find love that has always eluded both of them. Or is it that easy? Nothing is as it seems as a mystery and swindle takes place beneath the nose of the unknowing.I won't give anything away as the story is worth watching. Spoiler alerts would kill the beauty of this movie. I can say there is some sex so read the ""Parental Advisory"" on this site for those hints. The drastic age difference between the auctioneer and the patron as noted on several reviews here on IMDb might push some people away. However, moving past the age issue, this is actually a fairly good development of character evolvement. The ages didn't bother me much. The actors more than made up for it.Geoffrey Rush is EXCELLENT (when isn't he?) as the auctioneer. He's perfect in his elitism, idiosyncrasies, and snobbery. Sylvia Hoeks is breathtaking as the patron/love interest. It is easy to see how Geoffrey could fall so hard for her - ages withstanding. Jim Sturgess is the likable mechanic who helps the auctioneer understand how being so tightly wound can only lead to difficulties with his human mechanisms. Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the simple, yet loyal friend of the auctioneer. Beautiful touches are thrown in left and right as only a Tornatore story can be.This isn't Cinema Paradiso for those fans of the director. But this is definitely worth watching by those fans of Tornatore's work. It is elegant. It is breathtaking. It is mysterious. It is mischievous. All the things you can want in a mystery love story. If only it wasn't sooooo long. ;-) Worth your time to watch though. I will again in a few years. 7 out of 10.",The Best Offer
71,Venge,A Movie Destroyed By An Ending,7,14 March 2021,"As others have said before me, the acting in this movie was superb, the set designs were marvellous, the direction was masterful, and the story held so much promise. The entire movie was literally destroyed by the last 30 minutes, not just because it was sad and tragic, but because it was brainless and moronic.*Big Time Spoilers to follow*Let's start at the beginning. You want to plan an art heist, a BIG art heist. You (Billy) know of an exclusive auctioneer who has been secretly and illicitly building up a priceless art collection over decades, and you decide to steal it. All good so far. But then you devise your strategy. You decide place a beautiful girl in a large, decayed villa, fill that villa with antiques brought in by the truckload, and then have the girl contact your auctioneer. You decide to cleverly afflict the girl with a type of agoraphobia, so that she has been unable to leave the villa since her teens, and lives in a secret room. The plan is ... wait for it ... that the solitary, elderly auctioneer, who has never had a sexual relationship in his life, will slowly fall head over heels in love with the girl, draw her out of her crippling mental condition so that she is able to come to live in his own luxurious apartment, and become privy to the codes that open up that hidden door to the room that contains his secret art stash. Then you rob the stash. Brilliant!! No simple team of professional art thieves for these guys.However, the entire convoluted plan revolves around so many intangibles and unpredictables that to consider such a plot, and to go to the massive expense of trying to pull it off, is, in retrospect, completely absurd. Here are just a few of the very possible what ifs.What if he doesn't fall in love with the girl? What if he just thinks she's a complete nutcase and wants nothing to do with her. Infinitely logical considering his life choices up to that point. How were the planners to know that this girl would have such a magnetic effect on him? Had she not, the entire expense of renting the villa and stuffing it full of valuable antiques would have been for naught. I would say their odds of success on just this one point were well below the realm of possibility.What if he is not fooled by all those marvellous antiques, paintings and furniture that is supposed to have cluttered the villa for decades. Wouldn't he, the world famous auctioneer, immediately sense that they are not as old as they purport to be, or that they had recently been moved? You can't fake the stuffiness, the dust, the dirt of years of neglect and storage. He would very likely have sensed that something was off immediately.What if he never picked up the bits of rusted metal junk left conspicuously in very parts of the villa? What if he never brought said junk to his young friend Robert? What if he never confided the situation of the girl to Robert, which was the only way that Robert was able to manipulate the relationship? Being a lonely introvert, the greatest chance was that he would have said nothing of his own private emotional affairs.Why, while hiding behind the statue, did he not hear the complete personality change in the girl's voice while chatting on the telephone? Mentally sick individuals do not suddenly sound completely normal and happy This was the first big clue, about as subtle as a lead brick, that something was completely off about this supposedly mentally ill girl, but our auctioneer remained completely oblivious.The what ifs go on and on, ad infinitum, making the heist ""plan"" more a fantastical pipedream.What is most sad, is that had the entire ""surprise heist"" been completely eliminated from the premise of the film, so many more options could have presented themselves. Options with far more credibility.",The Best Offer

73,onlythusfar,Something a Little Wonky,6,22 April 2017,"I have mixed feelings/thoughts about ""The Best Offer"". I'm surprised by the number of people who said, that they could see the ending coming early on. Did they know, that this was supposed to be a caper/crime film ? I knew nothing about this and being raised on ""Disney"", most of the way through I fully expected this to be a sweet or possibly tragic love story. I found the ""twist"" at the end to be so abrupt, that it was confusing and seemed unfounded to me, based on what had gone before. I obviously didn't pick up any of the hints people say were so blatantAccepting the ending, I can see this film, as a psychological study of the power of emotion over intellect in a person's life. The main character, it seemed, had been running from emotion his entire life. To protect himself, as many of us do, from uncontrollable emotion, he adopted a very strong intellectual approach in his dealings with others. We see, that he hid a very strong vulnerability to romantic love, which displayed itself in his private gallery of women's portraits. ""His"" women were delicate, aesthetic works of art, with none of the inconvenient messiness of reality. I think, that he possibly had been raised on ""Disney"" princesses also. When, in the film, he met a woman, who piqued his intellectual interest, his defenses were lowered and he believed, that one of his fantasy women had manifested in physical reality. This left him vulnerable to his hidden emotional desires and in the film to his downfall and humiliation. If the aim of the film, was to show this character study, I think, that it needed to be more introspective and subtle and dispense with much of the melodrama and gimmicks, that it embraced. I found the ""caper"" plot, to be too intrusive and abrupt and in that, it overshadowed and preempted the man's inner struggle.This is why, I saw the film as being at odds with itself and thus a little ""wonky"". I found it very well done until the final scenes, which I found rushed and lacking in redemption a man of this intellectual capacity may have experienced. The art direction and cinematography were wonderful. The acting, especially by Geoffrey Rush was touching.",The Best Offer

The suspense and curiosity of the spectator are kept high until the last scene, when the spectator wonder if Claire will show up, by chance, in the Prague restaurant Night And Day. In this film, nobody is seriously threatened, no fight, no crime, nobody dies; the worst which happens is that the rich auctioneer is fooled and looses his cherished collection of valuable paintings, which is only a part of his fortune. Yet the spectator is captivated from the begin to the end. About the way the auctioneer is fooled, what is hard to accept is the fact that during his stays at the pub, in front of the mansion, he never asked any information about the mansion, to the people of the pub. He decides to do this too late. I liked the film, yet, I liked much more Cine Paradiso a few years ago. This is why I would give 10 to Cine Paradiso and 9 to The Best Offer.",The Best Offer
75,modernmonstersdotnet,True Fake,7,23 September 2016,"The best this movie has to offer is Geoffrey Rush, giving a subtly layered performance and elevating an otherwise classic (and classy) heist material to the heights of tragedy – and redemption. At the beginning, Virgil Oldman is seen as a cold fish, an auctioneer at the peak of his worldwide reputation. His refined eye can't be fooled as he scrutinises works of art he manipulates with gloved hands, gloves of which he has dozens of pairs meticulously aligned in a special cabinet. He does not even take them off when he dines at his favourite restaurant, where he has his table and his monogrammed tableware. He is, at his core, disgusted by other people and refuses to touch them or their possessions.But Virgil has a secret: for years, he has been under-evaluating arcane paintings of great value, expertising them as forgeries on which his partner in crime and failed painter Billy (Donald Sutherland, succulent as usual) successfully bids at auctions. Billy gets a cut of the profit and Virgil hangs his loots in his secret vault, where he can gaze at them in solitude. From the size of the vault and the number of paintings, one can say that this stunt has been lasting for quite some years.Claire Ibbetson, a mysterious woman (isn't there always one?) calls Virgil and ask him for an evaluation of a big collection of furniture and paintings. Reluctant at first, he finally agrees to meet her but she misses their first appointment, then another. He finally gets to see the collection but not its owner whom, her servant informs him, nobody has seen for twelve years as she suffers from agoraphobia and only leaves her panic room when everyone else has left the villa. She seems to be quite the bipolar recluse, with violent mood swings which only amplify his curiosity.Said curiosity is heightened again when he finds a piece of machinery in the villa's basement. After being expertised by a genius mechanics with whom he's in regular contact, the fragment reveals to be part of a 18th century automaton built by Vaucanson (he of the mechanical duck fame), which value if completed would be inestimable. A game of cat and mouse starts between the auctioneer and the potential seller, to whom he hides his discovery. He spies on her and finally see her 50′ after the film started, and talk to her only well into the second hour.Time and again he returns to the villa, grabbing here and there pieces of the automaton, which builds in parallel with the tension between the elusive Claire and himself. His initial mistrust is mollified by her constant yo-yoing between fear and attraction. They quarrel like lovers well before becoming so. Anything and its contrary, under a constant suspicion of treachery and betrayal. Scopophilia plays an important role in their relationship; he buys her couture dresses and jewels, in the hope she will get better and can get rid of her phobia and join him for a trip abroad.One won't be so cruel as to spoil the ending of a movie, which is predictable but elegantly put together, with the help of a paralysed midget gifted with eidetic memory. Virgil loses some, wins some and, at the time of the majestic last scene in a Prague restaurant, is a changed man. Meticulously filmed, well played by all involved and benefiting from an Ennio Morricone score, The Best Offer is a quiet thriller, almost perfect but for a few inconsistencies, fortunately appearing early enough in the picture not to impair the final momentum. There is always something authentic in a forgery, and everything can be faked but what one is feeling towards oneself. Whatever the distance self-inflicted between one and the rest of the world, one remains part of it, for better or for worse. A brilliant machine with a telltale heart, The Best Offer deserves its title.",The Best Offer

In other words, your eyes become bigger than your stomach.The main character is so ""cool"" and meticulous; it surprised me that he was susceptible to any outside influences.

85,azcoppen,Only missing Kaizer Soze,9,1 January 2015,"Goodness, what a film. Like the Usual Suspects, it needs to be watched a second time.Very much under the radar; tucked away into the VoD menu like one of the artworks portrayed in it. I thought Geoffrey Rush would forever be the Tailor of Panama, but here he is in the most exquisite form as his more neurotic and successful cousin. The cleverness of the script is in how the viewer is fooled as elegantly as the protagonist, experiencing his disbelief. You can see it coming, but you don't want to believe it - just like him. We thought we were watching a sensitive biopic about two people helping each other to overcome their separate phobias, only to discover you were watching a profoundly targeted and flawless forgery.There's also something regal about the underrated Sylvia Hoeks, even if it is difficult to categorise: a maturity for her age, or a perfectly-cast ""old soul"" vibe that works perfectly for the older man theorem. It's a subtle, robotic simplicity that could so easily be overdone, but is masterfully held back.On one side of the mirror, we have an auctioneer - an expert in detecting forgery - breathing life into his greatest artistic work: bringing an agoraphobic heiress back to life, whilst healing himself.On the other, we see another artist creating the perfect forgery: renting a mysterious house with an even more mysterious inventory from a dwarf savant, in order to draw his mark into madness so he can steal the most personal, priceless collection of artwork.But the final reveal is the painting supposedly obsessed over our heiress, apparently of her mother. The grand revenge scheme has been orchestrated by the protagonist's embittered partner-in-crime and shill-bidder, who was the artist. Before Virgil leaves London, Billy announces he's sent him one of his paintings, almost as if they were never going to speak again. When Virgil returns to see his emptied collection, all that is left are the remains that allow him to connect the dots: after a lifetime of being patronised and criticised by his friend for his supposedly meagre talents, Billy has co-ordinated the elaborate heist involving the girl and the robot, and rubs his friend's nose in his cleverness by signing and leaving Claire's special painting, with his thanks and admiration.Structure is everything in screen writing, and this script was beautifully constructed in itself as a piece of art, complete with eccentricities, contrasts, and its own signature. There is no reconciliation, just denouement. Perhaps a little more exposition would have been useful, but like all art, it was made to make you wonder what the artist's inspiration and plan were.",The Best Offer

He,Virgil, allows us to peer behind the hidden enclave along with him and share the chance to look into the forbidden making us desire it even more. If you like a well spun tale, then this would be a great one to dive into. Unlike the American method of making everything so obvious, this movie is like a nice French meal comprised of sweets and sours and savory yet subtle enough to keep you guessing even as the credits roll. I fond myself falling along with Virgil for this unique creature named Claire. The cinematography is not the best but the acting makes up for any lacking element.

91,sobeit712,A masterpiece of cinematic trickery,10,2 March 2014,"All great artists are masters of illusions and trickeries. Their creations mimic the reality so well, that they give hope and despair. They illicit real emotions like lucid dreams that makes you laugh and turn laughters to tears when you wake up in the nightmare. In that sense, all arts are forgery of reality.Giuseppe Tornatore's ""The Best Offer"" is one of those rare piece of art that makes you suspend your belief by way of stunning cinematography, beautiful story telling and skillful characterization. I can guarantee that you have not seen something like this in a long long while, and will probably won't see something similar for even longer while. Mr. Oldman is a stuffy and rightfully arrogant art connoisseurs and renowned auctioneer, who made a reputation by his craft as well as a fortune by his cunning. Years of training gave him sharp eyes to spot authentic art and forgery. But when it comes to dealing with people, he's somewhat handicapped and clueless, especially towards women. He's more interested in moldy oil painting than the flesh and touch of a human being. That all changed when he met Mrs Claire, an enigmatic recluse who suffers social anxiety so severe that she locked herself in her room ever since she's 14. She entrusted all her family belongings, among which there are many worthy antiques, to Mr. Oldman to be cataloged and auctioned off. Throughout the dealings between two, often sparked with intense conflicts and confrontations, the odd ""couple"" developed rapport and passion that is as eerie as it is heart wrenchingly beautiful, almost as if they are made for each other by their flaws in common. An artist's rendition of reality must be anchored by something that is truly believable in order to to invite the audience in and draw out the true emotional response. Geoffrey Rush's performance is so naturally brilliant and effortlessly authentic. His character hides explosive emotions and crippling vulnerability underneath a cold and snobbery veneer, just as many other characters he portrayed throughout his career. Sylvia Hoeks' Claire is startlingly effective, switching between a hollowing ghost of a mental patient and warmth and passion of young lover, toys and haunts Mr. Oldman's senses and sensibility as well as the audience. Worthy mention also goes to Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland, who vitally completes the whole puzzle with their truly believable on screen presence. It is a puzzle indeed, that will leave you thinking for hours after wards. Not because you are trying to make sense of what you have just saw, but because it confronts you with difficult questions about life itself to reconcile. If you ever asked a question ""why"" even when the answer to that ""why"" is so obvious, but you can not help but kept on asking the same question over and over, this movie will be a worth while experience for you. If your life has always been simply black and white and true and false, you will loathe the movie and everyone in it. To appreciate art, you must surrender your senses, and allow you be fooled with joy and pain. To appreciate life, I guess you will have to risk being fooled as well.

I must give credit to IMDb for being the only reputable review site to find greatness in this film (7.8/10).A story of dark romance entwined in mystery with direction from Giuseppe Tornatore (his best work to date being this movie). Geoffrey Rush unsurprisingly gives a standout performance as a managing director of an auction house.The film opens as Oldman receives a call from a young heiress named Claire (Sylvia Hoeks), who wants him to sort through and appraise her parent's art and antique collections.

It has an intriguing premise, great acting, and is full of beautiful paintings and beautiful buildings.The common criticism of this movie is people who say they saw the twist coming. That they've 'outsmarted' the movie and that made it less enjoyable. I don't agree with that assessment in the slightest. You were supposed to notice the hints. They were deliberately left out for you. Directors don't give you a dozen clues to the ending and then expect you to be thrown.If you then go on assuming that the director wanted you to have doubts, what you are left with is a very interesting concept. When did you make the jump from believing the relationship was real to believing it was fake? How many clues did you ignore? I can honestly say for myself that it was several. Just before the twist it's downright obvious what is going to happen. Somewhere along the line you went from believing the forgery was real to calling it fake. Did you abandon at the first false brush stroke? Or did you wait until you noticed a ""V"" in the eyeball of the painting?What people are upset about is that they wanted it to be real.

Well-acted, certainly, but with an artificialness that made it feel more like theatre than a film, and that is not intended as a compliment, or an allusion to the impossible ""theatrics"" used by the thieves for that matter.The pacing in this film was also just way off. It was already clear within almost the first 20 minutes how the film would finish and who the key protagonists were. The slowness with which that entirely expected outcome was reached was just too much for me.I ended up skipping through much of the second half, just to speed things along.The closing scene left some unanswered questions, as expected,I did briefly wonder if it might turn more hopeful. I thought Billy might ""pop up"" at the end and this would all turn out to be some sort of beneficial life lesson he had taught his erstwhile friend.But it seems that the final piece of ""revenge-art"" was probably intended to be the final scene itself; ""old man waiting, alone, surrounded by clocks ticking out his wasted life"".

It made me reflect on relationships I have (and have had), and the nature of trust and friendship.Geoffrey Rush does his usual excellent acting playing Virgil Oldman, a master auctioneer in demand around the world, and the owner of his own auction house in Italy. Rich, extremely knowledgeable of the art world, and totally self-assured, its seems that Virgil has it all. However, Virgil isn't all he seems to be...he sometimes lies to, and cheats his clients for personal gain, he's a germaphobe, and in his personal life, a chaste and lonely recluse. He's prone to tantrums and temper flares. His world is an opulent cocoon of his own making, and he'd have it no other way.Then comes a call from Claire, a wealthy heiress who suffers from agoraphobia. No one has seen Claire in years, Virgil is told, and slowly but surely he becomes obsessed with a woman who at a certain level shares some of Virgil's personality flaws...her cocoon is in her own mind.To tell you more would be to spoil this outstanding film. It is a tale of love, a story of obsession. It examines friendship and relationships--both personal and business. It shows the consequences of actions, and the limitations of self-proclaimed power. It is a love story that will strike the heart of anyone who has been in love and understands it's rewards and perils. Yes, I can't stop thinking about this film.

105,Seraphima12,"Forgeries, offers and the truth",10,17 March 2018,"I absolutely love the movie! I have watched it 3 times, every time finding new layers and 'truths', each time seeing the characters from a different angle. For me, this is the movie how it should be - a piece of art that can be admired over and over again. 
Also, in my opinion, this movie is not about Virgil Oldman (The Auction House Director) but about the mystery of women and love, and one woman in a particular -Claire Ibbetson. This character epitomises in the story all women at once, their mystery (to the Oldman), their beauty, their magic powers, and of course the power of love even though a forged one. 
There are three major themes in the movie 1)forgeries: any forgeries from art to life ones; 2) offers: the ones we get in life from others; and 3) truths: the inner ones that we hide and the truths we want to find in the world or the ones that are presented to us by others. 
Virgil Oldman - forges his opinions on art in order to obtain beautiful portraits of women and together with them love. He offers very little for these masterpieces but the real truth is that in the end he pays a very high price for all of them and all at once. 
Claire Ibbetson - forges a woman in love in order to teach Oldman a lesson and maybe benefit from the forgery in a financial way too. She offers her acting and smartness in return for money and along the way gets love from the Oldman (an unexpected offer). But the truth is she does it to relive her affair with an older man, her lover, who was killed in a car accident some years ago.
Billy Whistler - an artist who forges art to help his friend, Oldman, and get some cash too. He offers his friendship and skills but gets just criticism in return until he decides to take a revenge. But the truth is he just wants an appreciation of his talent that he never gets from the Oldman. By forging beautiful portraits of women, he is forging love yet does it with outmost mastery, paying his respect to all the depicted on the portraits women. To me, he gets the best offer ever and a deserved one too.",The Best Offer

It's just so obvious. There are lots of holes in this film, and so many ways the lead character could have found out what was going to happen. 'Robert', the man who builds mechanical and electrical wizardry is way too young. Such characters in real life are always much older. And, indeed, it's the part Donald Sutherland should have been cast for. (Spoiler alert) We must presume it's 'Robert' that manages to by-pass the lead character's alarm system. There's assorted debris left behind in the art room, but no ladder! Neither are there any wall fixings visible for some heavy paintings. When the caretaker switches the lights on in the cellar for the lead character, the lights are already on! I really didn't like this film, not because it is pretentious, but because it promises cleverness, but doesn't deliver.

The truth is spoken in brutal ways. You get shocked by it, it's highly aggressive. Thus, when the actors say things that appear to be plain, they seem accurate. If you can say the hard things, the soft things now seem believable.
The guy has inner limitations (cheats), the girl has outer limitations (space). When they meet, the guy works on his outer limitations (his work, his possessions), the girl works on her inner limitations (being afraid).

116,joshwebster-44359,This film is the definition of deception!,10,1 April 2021,"*Spoilers*Deception starts off by setting your eyes onto an art auctioneer, Virgil Oldman. And you see the type of character Oldman is. The beginning of this film had me intrigued and I believe that was because of the uniqueness of the character, his way of living and job role. I have not come across a film which takes you into the life of a art auctioneer, so I think that way personally for me I was quite interested in the opening of Deception but it's not just for that reason. The film moves along nicely, at a good pace, keeping you interested and guessing at points.Now as we get to the point where Oldman gets into the Villa and starts finding these old parts and realising Claire is seeming to being hiding something. I thought the way it was reviled and unravels was done perfectly and was reviled at the right time. Also going back to where I touched on a uniqueness in Deception I found another one in Claire's illness she had. So again for me personally I was extremely intrigued by both Virgil and Claire.Speeding things up here and jumping around slightly, when Oldman goes to Robert with the old parts he's been finding at the villa and talking to Robert about his problems with Claire I found this to be brilliant, I loved the character of Robert and his knowledge of women and love, I thought that was interesting and fun. At these points of the film you don't start to get little suspicious of people and for example I thought the parts where getting deliberately put around the villa for Oldman to find by Claire.Now to the point of Oldman getting attacked and he calls Claire and she overcomes her fear to step outside and save Oldman. This is the point where you feel the happy ending is to come. Claire and Virgil have gone through this situation and come out of it as best as can be, we see Oldman and Claire living together and being happy, having dinner with Robert and his girlfriend. So from the start to this point I was impressed with this film and thought it was very good. Oh, but it was not over yet...Oldman arrives home from his last auction to find Claire is gone. Oldman is reassured she had gone out with Robert and his girlfriend Sarah. Oldman takes the painting of which Claire loved and kept with her therefore Oldman decides to take it into his hidden room of paintings. So at this point I thought Oldman would take Claire's painting into his room put it on the wall and Oldman's collection would be complete, representing a metaphor of that Claire completes Oldman, himself and his life. But as Virgil steps into that room you are hit with a possibility that Claire has stolen all his art and to Oldman's disbelief and my own, the viewers disbelief that was the case and now the speculations of Robert earlier on are becoming to be the case. Now this point and beyond this point is where Deception goes from a very good film to a exceptional, perfect film. How the con is reviled and the fact Billy, Oldman's so called best friend was apart of this and how the crazy lady in the corner of the pub comes to be crucial in this story and she is the real Claire who owns the Villa. At this point how it all unravels is absolutely brilliant.Deception ends very well, Oldman goes to the restaurant, Claire's favourite place, when Oldman steps inside and we see the theme of this restaurant is all this old gear work and clocks just puts the cherry on top for me and so Oldman sits there waiting for Claire.My conclusion, Deception is the best film I have ever seen.

I've always been a Geoffrey Rush fan, but in this movie, I've seen a very special Rush who, by the way his on screen persona goes thru a life changing metamorphosis, creates a real, day-to-day living among us man with real life personal fears, heartbreaking disillusions and self rediscovering. He makes us care for the very rigid and robotic Virgil Oldman in a way that surprises the senses. He is, in the beginning, a character who most people would find repelling by his uncomfortable attitude and bossy ways. But, as the movie proceeds, he is changed by this peculiar and frightful young woman who has a way of bringing him up, and crushing him down within minutes in their dialog. I must say that director Tornatore wrote this amazingly beautiful story with a golden pencil, I'm sure. This is not another love story. It's a life story, set in the world of Arts, where there's more to discover behind the colors of paintings and the still faces of sculptures than meets the eye. As the movie comes to an end, you will face a difficult task: to be thankful that such a story made it to the big screen, or to desire that it would've remain only in the writer's mind and heart.

But to my amazement, it has unnaturally lame reviews I've read and heard. People have problems with austerity this film depicts - they need to come out of their jam-packed Michael bay sort of extravagance.It's not your regular drama film where logic has to be intelligently improvised (which as a matter of fact, it does too) - try changing your lenses and you will realize that it's a piece of art writhed with stern world of disorders - you need other scales to judge it. Yes there were some less than perfect film making moments but that doesn't take away the passion of it. From performances to design and music, this film ambushed my senses.",The Best Offer

The intensity and intrigue were captivating... making it a great 'escape movie' that allowed you to detach from day to day thoughts.This movie keeps you on your toes. I found it impossible to predict what would happen next. I could just sit back and let the movie take me on the journey.Geoffrey Rush delivered a brilliant performance, yet again. Kiruna Stamell... this is the first movie I have seen her in. Her character was completely original.I also enjoyed the fact that a lot of the actors were new to me. It made the movie very fresh. It is often hard to know which characters are significant to the overall plot, and which are just passing through.I'd call it a bit of a psychological thriller, yet not in any way horror.

Let's start from first scenes. Film tell us about every person very well. For example in first ten minutes we know nearly anything about Mr. Oldman. He hates everyone. He touchs every person and every thing only with his gloves. Although he loves old pictures, sculptures and has an amazing telant: he can understand is a picture fake or not. This roll is very interesting and Rush did it very well.
Middle of the film is a bit boring, but director has found good solution. He has created scenes that make you continue watching. So he prepares you for final scenes.
Final scenes have thinked very well. I thought that film will be ended like other films and didn't imagine real end. Claire makes Oldman love people, but she deceive him. Nobody can imagine end like this, because film don't have happy end and it's brillant.
Acttually filmmakers have worked very well and they deserve good rating.",The Best Offer

133,janeblevins,Great elements that can't quite come together,6,20 April 2014,"I wanted to like this movie from the moment it began. The camera work is very good. Geoffrey Rush is entirely convincing as an obsessive compulsive auctioneer whose mannerisms are somehow perfectly suited to the rarefied world of rich widows and heiresses in which he moves. But something about the movie started to wear me down. The more I watched the more impatient I became with its lumbering and increasingly laborious pace. This is a really savvy and interesting idea for a movie but sadly, it suffers from the deus ex machina effect: crucial elements get phoned in, important information is placed in the mouths of characters who have no obvious reason to spout this stuff, which basically reduces them to human props that help drive the plot. And again, sadly, a couple of the actors are just not very good. They seem confused to be speaking occasionally which is confusing for the spectator and this overshadows a brilliant performance by Rush and an admirable effort by the female lead Sylvia Hoeks.Bref, this movie could have been a real gem. It remains something of a diamond in the rough: it is definitely worth the viewing but it might leave you a little disappointed it wasn't better executed.",The Best Offer

Maybe it is because I'm too experienced but I have been amazed recently by the way current writers, often on foreign TV shows, have been able to create unique, constantly surprising takes, playing with preconceived notions, not confirming them, as this film does. I gave it a five because I felt so betrayed but I can see why the less experienced or those better at forgetting what they've seen previously might enjoy it much more. It did garner lots of award nominations, I think mostly for the music and cinematography, but there were best picture and acting awards, too, so maybe it's just me or there weren't any better pictures made that year or the producers were skilled at working the festivals (StonyBrook, Long Island?

The performances are, on the whole, excellent, with Geoffrey Rush perfect as Virgil Oldman - a celebrated art and antiquities expert and auctioneer, head of a famed auction house, and a bachelor.Oldman's frustration in finding a soul mate is assuaged by building an enormous collection of portraits of beautiful women - often procured illicitly with the help of an accomplice (played exquisitely by Donald Sutherland). Because he has acquired many of his paintings illegally, they are kept in a hidden room in his house, where only he can be in their company.Oldman's world is suddenly disturbed by a young woman who asks him to liquidate her parents' estate. The woman is elusive, however, and appears to suffer from acute agoraphobia. His initial irritation at being inconvenienced by the woman gradually transforms into a longing for what he had thought he would never have: a lover.The setting for the film was clearly chosen for both setting the mood and symbolizing Oldman's soul - old, disused, needing to be refinished.

Who isn't the biggest fan of human relationships, only taking pleasure in his still antique portraits. But this slowly unfolds very interestingly, and not in a cliché expected manner.What truly impressed me, is the third act with its major surprise; is that there was zero interest in the walk-through of how it all worked out up until this point, your usual go-to technique to explain a plot twist, instead, only the surprise was stated and instead focusing on the psychological aftermath of the protagonist which perfectly goes in tune with the atmosphere of the movie which is a deep look into the psych of a malcontent old man.",The Best Offer

Secondly, it's unbelievable that Virgil, the accomplished expert, had no idea who Claire was or who was behind the door and yet 'Sure, I'll take this signed contract and look at an expired childhood passport as proof of identity! Let's get this done!' The man wasn't fit to manage a livestock auction. Third, with apologies to Mr. Rush, the sex scenes were revolting. There are some people I just do not want to see in bed. Jim Sturgess as Robert would have been better. And the ending is nihilism at its finest. Is Virgil in the restaurant believing Claire really loved him and will show up or in the mental hospital/old folks home recalling the restaurant scene?

Geoffrey Rush is exceptional and I wish he gets some tangible recognition (the one he can put on shelf) for his performance. Script, music, acting performances are brilliant and well put together.Unfortunately, there is one huge BUT. The movie has over two hours and it took me about 40 minutes to figure out the ending. The problem is that story is giving out too many clues from the very beginning. Once you realise what is going on, which is quite soon if you watch it closely, the experience turns from 'what will happen next' into 'I knew exactly this was coming'. Quite unfortunate since the movie stands on a great ""shocking"" finale. Too bad...

157,themovement1229,"Exceptional acting, a creative and highly original plot. The best illustration the psychological phenomenon known as Shaping.",9,26 March 2014,"Even though I anticipated superb acting from Rush, I was still blown out of the water by his skill. Tornatore offers us our age redemption with this film-redemption from the boring, easily detectable mischief that appears in most of today's suspenseful films. People can usually figure out the ending before half the movie is gone. Now I can't say that I didn't have any idea, because deep down I think I knew that Claire was full of it. But because Virgil wanted to experience young love, an opportunity he never got, he became vulnerable and it would have broken my heart to accept Claire's scheme right from the beginning. This is a brilliant undertone of the movie-Tornatore highlights Virgil's character by making him the center of the first half hour of the film. Once we understand who Virgil is, we understand his obsession, his passion, his life. The character Virgil Oldman is a beautiful dramatization of the dark obsession in all of us-from sexual to materialistic obsessions; Tornatore presents us with a story that allows us to learn about ourselves through film, and he does so with a movie that is about as close to perfection as I have ever seen. The only negative thing I have to say about the movie is the ending was confusing and a bit mixed up. The Best Offer is a story about a concept in Psychology known as ""shaping"", where people consciously or unconsciously shape the character and behaviors of another person through positive and negative reinforcement, feedback, and punishment. Claire shapes Virgil throughout the entire film, and then devastates him leaving him with nothing but the raw fake persona he has been turned into. And, like an animal waiting for his master, Virgil waits for her in the restaurant Night and Day, where he hopes she will come back to him, reaffirming the theme throughout the movie that concealed in every forgery is a piece of truth. Specifically, Virgil waits for her to come back because that would mean she could not live with what she did, and even though she was ""in character"" every time they interacted, her words were still her own, and maybe the piece of truth concealed in her forgery were the words ""I love you.""

Sutherland was, IMO, miscasted (""miscast"" in olde English). He's just too old and faltering. Yet his Americanese, compared to the elegant English spoken by Oldman, underscores the difference in things fine, and things not so fine. At the end, indeed, Billy mentions how Oldman never appreciated Billy's artist's talents. There are other gorgeous little ""touches"" in this movie. One I loved was when Oldman zips Claire's gown, and the zipper makes a tiny click when it's (""its"" in Olde English) travel is done, when it is closed. Ah, the zipper: yet another mechanism in a movie where mechanisms, and machinations, play heavy. And meanwhile, the sets were absolutely stunning. One got to feel so at home in all of them, from the bar across the street from the Villa, to the villa, to the auction house, and Oldman's collection room with it's white leather chair. Scenes of Oldman, sitting in his collections room among the paintings of female beauty reminded me of the movie ""Laura"", when the detective, night after night, sits in the living room of a woman, whose putative murder he is investigating, gazing a a portrait of her.",The Best Offer

If it weren't for the description of the film as a crime drama mystery I wouldn't of known where to expect the movie to go. The main question rolling around in my brain was why would Virgil choose Robert as his confidant when he and Billy were friends for years? Secondly, why would Sarah discuss Robert's affairs with Virgil? Lastly, why was Billy so intent on convincing Virgil of his love and friendship?The whole time I kept wondering when the big climax was going to happen. At the end when all was revealed it wasn't a big surprise that Claire, Robert, Billy, Fred, and Sarah con Virgil out of his art collection. Thankfully Sylvia Hoeks shows great skill in playing the crazy Claire. Listening to her hysterics gave me anxiety. She was amazing and annoying at the same time. Geoffrey Rush gave a solid performance. I also like the fact Virgil is a con artist and has OCD. If the producers had cut out the unnecessary scenes they could have developed their characters more.If you are looking for a movie that builds excitement as it progresses then this movie isn't for you. It's a pretty predictable plot with zero surprises.",The Best Offer

168,teenvan-281,A modern world old stone,7,6 May 2014,"A movie plotted nicely, precisely covering only a few places, yet depicting the true line of cinematography, light color were used for costumes and the plotting, giving an expression of late 80's in the modern world . An excellent performance by Geoffrey Rush. The other characters moves in the movie but the center of attraction was drawn to the auctioneer. Shows the world of auctions and its complexity at some points, though the movie was based on arts of 18th century still movie was not an art movie precisely. Movie though seems slow and you may get bored at a time but its a maze at last. It's like a moist chip with a taste of crisp in the end.",The Best Offer

The movie is breathtaking and captures you from the first seconds. Mr. Rush acting is superb, as are the art direction, cinematography, score and of course, the plot. Film is full of beauty, emotion and humor. It feels like a united whole from beginning to the end and leaves a great impression. I was also surprised later, when I found out that it was shot digitally with Arri Alexa Studio - I was sure it was shot on film. This really is a camera which will finally kill film, although I love film so much. Ironically, film may remain the medium of choice for low budget productions, who can not afford renting this Arri beast.",The Best Offer
170,franked18,Festival Class with Banal Execution,4,20 July 2013,"The cast and creative team endow this film with the promise of greatness. And indeed, for the first 15 minutes or so, the crisp cinematography, coupled with Rush's authoritative characterization, keep this promise firmly viable. In the first instance we have an endearingly dour, (refreshingly heterosexual) dandy of an art and antiques dealer, who likes to dabble in a little illicit personal procurement every now and then.So far so plausible. We'll even forgive that they called him Virgil. His professional services are enlisted by an elusive 20-something year-old agoraphobe. She consents only to talk with him through a wall, while he systematically itemizes the vast array of antiques housed within her parents' decaying villa (in which she lives). Okay. But it's all downhill from there, in a series of clichés, 'not-quite' plot devices, and self-indulgent direction. Virgil's trusted mechanician and confidant, Robert, for example, is an impossible combination of youth and exhaustive expertise, rendered even more irritating by his British soap-opera cad demeanor. The conversation between him and Virgil in which the latter explicates the significance of a particular 18th Century inventor, is a cringe-worthy exercise in obtuse Hollywoodised scripting. Film, as a storytelling medium, has no excuse to lug theatrical economy around with it when trying to relay such information. That's just lazy direction and screen writing. Nor should it require such overt acts as Virgil accidentally dropping his phone while spying-up Miss Agoraphobia from behind a (conveniently erotic, as if we were dumb enough to require further reminding of the dynamics incurred when a lonely old man enters into fellowship with some young feminine eye candy) marble statue at the end of the room. It's the stuff of chick flicks.While the twists and half-turns (because they weren't entirely unpredictable) at the end of the film make for interesting, potentially thrilling cinema-fodder, the pay-offs ultimately suffer from clunky set-up. Anomalies such as Claire - the girl-genius with a freakish propensity for remembering details, or the all-too-convincingly-played groundsman Lambert, beg more questions than they answer. And not in a good way; rather, in a way that alludes to a director who, like Virgil, was rather too concerned with aesthetics, at the expense of something deeper and more gratifying.Unless, of course, you get a kick out of characters called Virgil Oldham transpiring to *actually* be a Virginal Old Man. Then you'll likely consider this film an intellectual masterpiece.",The Best Offer

172,aleksandarbbkostic,Pleasant feel of elegance mixed with reality of cruel dirty world,9,27 October 2015,"I like movies which pays attention to main role making it so strong, so elegant. Geoffrey Rush was presented just like that. People who are in love with art, often are weird in they own way in the eyes of the other ,,normal,, people, but Geoffrey played his role so elegant that he created one new ,,acceptable,, picture of artists for those who can't understand art. I'm someone who really pay attention on every single detail in the movie, but I certainly didn't realize that Robert is in deal with Claire and that was fascinating and the most mysterious thing about this movie. Congrads to Geoffrey Rush on scene when he realizes that he is robbed. That was such a good played reaction. In the other side, Sylvia Hoeks is really the best character for her role because her beauty was as much impressive as all those pictures which were part of Oldman's collection. I rated this movie with 9 because there is few thing that are ,,not my tempo,, such as: average acting of Liya Kebede (plus her leather jacket in luxury restaurant during that formal event of Oldman's retirement); mistake with the name of restaurant in Prague (sticker at the front door with real, present-day, name of it); so many chances given to Claire and her wish to meet with Oldman; strange situation in which nobody from restaurant never asked Oldman is he maybe part of filming group, so he would realize his mistake earlier (and people from the restaurant had that chance of asking him that question when he came to the restaurant looking for her when she hid herself in the attic of the house). But, all those ,,mistakes,, are so small and unnoticeable in compare with quality screenplay and good acting of characters.",The Best Offer
173,justcoolyou,A work of art,9,15 August 2016,"An excellent work of art or ""literature"" as the film practically self references in the scene where Virgil discusses his love relationship with Billy. The music and visuals follow the theme of luxury and culture. This is a psychological thriller, with a mysterious woman whose identity we first yearn to discover, and later put in question. There is doubt inserted progressively about all of Virgil's relationships, and it is noteworthy that he loses and regains trust in all his companions throughout the film. This serves wonderfully to making the betrayal even more believable and personal to us, the audience, for we also lost and regained the trust in these characters. Thus importantly Virgil is not portrayed as a naive fool, but a cynic with one vulnerability that it took much time and creativity to exploit: a lack of human warmth.There is a clear message at the end that he still values the love he received, despite all signs that it was a false experience. This is an interesting message on the meaning of human experience. Indeed one can even be left to feel that Virgil is better off without his wealth and with some memory of human love (even if false), than the materialistic empty life he had before. His surname, Oldman, and the final scene surrounded by clocks and passing time, drum this conclusion home.",The Best Offer

177,MagdalenaFigueroaSaavedra,The Great Pretender,10,15 February 2021,"The great pretender (spoilers)The great pretender has been deceived. This film is about delving for something real in a world of lies and counterfeits. Elegant well crafted story about how love and friendship can indeed be faked and yet at the same time hold something real at the very core. Of course, the big irony of the story is how the main character was unable to realize he was being deceived when his work was to know how to tell an original from a forgery in the exclusive world of art and antiques. Virgil Oldman is an arrogant and vain man who treats everyone with disdain, even his only 'friend', indifferent to the fact that he may hurt his feelings. Despite all this, Virgil Oldman didn't deserve what happened to him.Make no mistake, everything we see in this story has been carefully calculated to entrap the main character. The automaton, the agoraphobia disorder, the friendly engineer, the servile caretaker, the jealous girlfriend, the loyal friend. The real Claire, the very owner of the villa gives us an idea about how long was the swindle in the making, she says the engineer (Robert) rented the villa for the last two years.
During the film we hear all the characters constantly stating phrases like: 'You have my word', 'To be honest', 'To tell you the truth', 'I promise', 'Thank you for your trust', 'I trust you blindly' when actually none of these phrases where truthful, because none of them were actually telling the truth, not even Virgil, who's reputation would be shattered if anyone would find out about his paintings and how he acquired them. His collection of women in the paintings is supposed to make us feel sorry for his loneliness, to see him as a fragile man who has a lot to offer but never knew how to find a woman to share his life with, a sad lonely man who has to hear a woman's voice on the telephone looking at portraits of women in order to fulfill his fantasy, so we assume he built a strong cocoon to hide his vulnerability, although I wouldn't make excuses for his unbearable superiority smug attitude, but we can see that even when his relationship with Claire was already stablished he didn't tell the truth about the Vaucanson automaton, he lies right to her face by telling that he wouldn't be able to say what the remaining parts of the automaton are when he sees them in the showcase. Not even at that moment he was able to tell the truth and be honest.I laughed out loud during two scenes, when Virgil tossed first the contract and then the flowers after an insignificant comic argument with Claire through the closed door.At the end of the film we see that Virgil realized that yes, Claire, Robert and his purported 'girlfriend' obviously conned him and took his unlawful lifetime paintings collection, but is only after he turns over the portrait of the dancer (which he didn't recognized at any previous moment as Billy's work) and he sees the final message from his alleged 'friend', that he painfully realizes that it was all his 'friend' making, Billy, the one who plotted against him by using his main vulnerabilities, i.e., the mystery of the automaton pieces, knowing that he did his thesis on Jacques de Vaucanson when he was a student, and the irresistible bait of the damsel in distress, luring Virgil into a web of lies and deception. In one of the final scenes he is in his garden trying to call someone, Claire, Billy, Robert, it doesn't matter. He discovers the paintings are gone, sees the automaton with Roberts final voice message, finds out about the real Claire and the villa, turns over the painting and sees Billy's final message all with the same clothes he had when he came back. So we can assume that the scene trying to call someone was made only after these painful discoveries.Virgil did keep one promise by not burning the painting of the dancer, the one Billy sent to 'remind him what a great artist he could have been if only he would have believed in him' and taking it with him to Prague. There was certainly some resentment in Billy's plot to swindle Virgil, if he only wanted the paintings he could have found another way to steal them, instead he decided to humiliate him, to hurt him. At the same time if it wasn't for this swindle Virgil would most likely never felt or experienced love, since he was unable to open himself to overcome his fear towards women. So maybe, Billy wanted to give Virgil the chance to fall in love, as a strange act of mercy within a plan to despoil him from his most cherished possessions.Geoffrey Rush plays Virgil Oldman perfectly.
I must say I didn't like the main actress at all, she seems to be very unapproachable, distant and unexpressive, a very unpleasant woman. I wish they would have chosen another actress to play the role of Claire Ibbetson. I didn't enjoy a single scene with her in it. She always looked bitter, what a sulky face!
The faces Jim Sturgess who plays Robert makes in certain moments seem to reveal he was mocking Virgil.
Donald Sutherland was fine playing the longtime friend Billy, the 'accomplice' the 'trusted procurer of women'. He reveals some traces of his resentment to Virgil in his voice, the choosing of his words and his demeanor.
I had my doubts if Lambert was also in on it, because he emphasizes that Virgil must take the first call on his birthday, despite the fact that it's tradition, and he also insisted Virgil should take her call after she 'missed' their first appointment and because he says Claire wants to meet Virgil at the villa, and he says: 'Where else?' when I have no indication Lambert could have known by then what was Claire's alleged condition if he knew anything at all.
Fred the caretaker was as much as a complete fabrication as the rest of the characters, everything he said or did was a lie, 'If you give me your keys I put them in your car' (about the automaton pieces) to place the GPS. In my opinion I enjoyed much more the scenes with Fred the caretaker, Lambert and the superficial interactions Virgil had in the bar opposite the villa with the bartender, the real Claire and his endless display of money spending than the scenes with Robert and Claire.
The scene where we see Claire in the bathtub under the water is supposed to simulate a portrait, like a painting. That was well done.
We get all the time that with this movie there was more than meets the eyes. 'I'd like to rewrite the last chapter, a more upbeat ending' was one of the most direct clues that this was the case.Maybe we cannot be sure about the sequence of events at the end of the film, I don't know if he went first to Prague or he end up later in the institution unable to take care of himself due to the great distress he had encounter. Perhaps it was in the same order the scenes are presented. First he had the shock and was institutionalized and then he 'recovered' and decided to move to Prague, to wait eternally for his 'long lost love', someone that didn't exist and spoke on the phone to a 'director', most likely Billy moving the threads of one of his puppets.
'There is always something authentic concealed in every forgery', Billy did feel affection and gratitude for Virgil, Robert was most likely going to miss Virgil's 'friendship' and Claire maybe really loved the way he talked, as well as holding some true fondness for him.
Virgil took a long time to answer to the waiter that he approved the wine at the restaurant and also in the last scene when hi is asked if he he is alone or waiting for someone. Very snooty.There are way too many busts in this movie, I must say, they are everywhere, even at the institution. Virgil's house didn't seem elegant but tacky with so many busts.
Ennio Morricone's music is simply sublime, a master piece within the master piece this movie really is.Virgil Oldman is presented with the idea of an illusion, an endless parade of lies, yet an opportunity to break free from his cocoon and experience love in an idillic mysterious story that was sadly, nothing more than a mirage.",The Best Offer

Only does the last 15 minutes does the storyline move on and the ending is actually the best part as it wasn't about some lonely old guy pining over a young woman. It's a cruel ending but least it had something to it that the rest of the film seriously flopped in!They are all amazing actors and love each of them but god knows what possessed them to agree to be in this movie. As a 23 year old woman it genuinely made me feel uncomfortable with him watching Sylvia Hoeks and even more so the split second sex scenes.This is the type of film I'm actually annoyed I watched as I've wasted my spare time to watch such utter crap.

The relationship between Virgil Oldman (virgin old man) and Clair develops painstaking slow but utterly beautiful and surprisingly complex, filled with all sorts of emotions. We understand the true meaning of passion, anxiety, anger, vulnerability and loving someone selflessly, almost like a childish romantic. I love suspense movies yet not a fan of love or romantic movies. This movie kept me engaged all throughout with ""What will happen next""? It has all the elements of a great movie; love, suspense, fear, crime... The ending is beyond brilliant. You would never guess... Don't read anymore reviews and watch the movie. You will not be disappointed.",The Best Offer
197,judit-krasznai,A waste of Geoffrey Rush's talent!,2,15 October 2014,"This was so promising and turned out to be a melodramatic mess of a con movie. Like someone earlier said, it looked like someone threw out a very intriguing script out the window after the first 20 minutes or so of the movie. I was feeling sorry for Geoffrey Rush. Actually, it's not even the sad ending of the story that bothers me, but the poor execution of it. This story starts out as something with the promise of fineness and delicacy, and at one point starts to be totally over the top and even illogical. It is one of those moments when I feel insulted that someone is actually expecting me to believe this crap.",The Best Offer

Unfortunately, I could not remember the name of the movie to tell my daughter to watch it because we both love the same type of movies, more or less..I finally remembered who played in it and went on the search(only by seeing him in other movie searches,ha!)...I love Geoffrey Rush, he is such an excellent actor and you really get involved in his character. It may seem boring or draggy at first(not for long) the acting makes it wonderful..STICK WITH IT..! I don't want to say much about the movie other than WATCH IT !! it is an excellent movie..I hate spoilers..try not to read them if you can, at least not for this movie!!!",The Best Offer
200,nikdam,Warning avoid this film - my first ever review of film but feel compelled to say how poor this is.,3,21 April 2014,"The beginning of this film promises so much, which is why the subsequent two+ hours (felt much longer) are such a disappointment as the story becomes complete interminable tosh. Acting is fine, and the setup is good, but it appears that 20 minutes in someone lost the original script and picked up a copy of the Letts guide to Great Expectations.It is one of those films that aliens could have turned up at any minute and would not have looked out of place.The majority of the supporting actors are English, but the buildings and street landscape clearly is not England, so I found myself confused as to where we were supposed to be. Other films have done a much better job of setting a film in Italy with actors speaking English.Finally, the plot holes are huge, and seem to willingly contradict themselves. Perhaps this is to emphasis the effect that falling in love has on the main character, who is too besotted not to able to connect the dots and recognise these inconsistencies, but I fear this is too generous a conclusion. The film is simply a mess.The one saviour is that the set designers, cinematographer and actors clearly don't realise the end product will be so bad, and are therefore very good throughout. The failure of this film rests on the script- writers, producers, editors and especially the director. With lots of beautifully shot and acted screens then a competent director should have been able to a assemble a mediocre film in the edit. However, what he has produced is the worst film I've seen in a decade.",The Best Offer
201,andrew_murn,"A sad ending, but not disappointing.",9,11 July 2020,"Watching this movie, until the last 15 minutes, I thought that Geoffrey Rush had been mis-cast in a Romantic Comedy.When he entered his inner-sanctum with his new paining, his eyes were down. They'd never been down before on entry, and it was obvious that when he looked up he was going to see something unexpected.It reminded me of the ending of ""Psycho"", so I'll leave it at that.It's difficult to imagine anyone other than Rush being able to carry it off.Although I watched till the end, I would rather that it had ended at that point. I believe that would have made it more dramatic.JMHO",The Best Offer
202,beechnut87,Very Enjoyable,10,20 May 2013,"This is for rightwingisevil - You are confusing Billy Whistler played by Donald Sutherland for Robert played by Jim Sturgess. Billy knew all about his collection as he helped him acquire it. The painting Virgil received was painted by him...thus the note on the back.Absolutely splendid movie.The best I have watched so far this year. Geoffry Rush was excellent, however, I am not much of a Donald Sutherland fan, the arrogance that he carries around in real life comes through in all the roles he portrays.

203,dgilligan17,Art Into Life,10,21 May 2013,"Great movies have the power to make you think and this movie had me thinking for so long I couldn't sleep on the night I saw it. It is a tremendous film with a deeply unsettling message and even now, 24 hours after seeing it I am haunted by the end.It's a fairy story and nightmare rolled into one. It's not what happens that's important it's how it happens. the story is great but the plot is even better.Forget the bad reviews and make up your own mind. If you subscribe to the notion that Life imitates Art or Art imitates Life go see it. You won't be disappointed.",The Best Offer
204,laxadrian,The Best Offer,8,5 November 2013,"A movie with an original script this time , thank god for that, a movie that captivates you from the first minutes of view . Geoffrey Rush's acting , as always , is majestic and it kind of brings you an old scent in a modern times movie.....of course the end is bringing you back with the feet strongly on the ground in a very shocking way , but this is what the movie and the director wants in fact to achieve : the cruel truth of ''Reality'' but still even after realizing what happened , Mr. Oldman ( Geoffrey Rush ) still lets himself fall back into his hopeless dream of love .....Beautiful movie recommended for general viewing in my opinion.",The Best Offer
205,vickie59,Excellent slice of arty entertainment,9,5 September 2013,"What a superb movie! Went to the movies today with little expectations, other than I would be seeing something 'classier' than the normal fare. The movie started off nicely with Geoffrey Rush dominating the screen with his larger than life character, not particularly to my liking. However, as the story unfolded and the plot deepened the subtle changes transforming him into an image of one his finer works of art, I found myself mesmerised and transported into his world. The complexity of the plot developed nicely and my suspensions were aroused reasonably early. However, I didn't mind at all - for the journey was beautiful. The acting, cinematography, music, script - and beautiful artwork and scenery - certainly compensated for any flaws the movie had. Some may say it was predictable and flawed in parts, but hey, enjoy the experience and immerse yourself in fantasy - this is a movie after all. I find myself still puzzling over some aspects of the plot - the real Clair, what's going on there. I also would have thought that Lambert would have had good reason to be complicit with the others. Gem of a movie - I can't wait to see it again.",The Best Offer

Just Wow,10,14 March 2015,"Honestly, if you're in the mood to be sucked into something that's going to be an emotional roller coaster, one of likes which you have never seen, this is it. This film was like the wicked witch in the forest telling Hansel and Gretel to come in to the Gingerbread house, only they're the ones that get burned, and not the witch. You seriously need to brace yourself for this movie. Don't read the spoilers, because you'll just kick yourself after.By the end of it, I had a lump in my throat, my anxiety was through the roof, and I was just shaking. That's what a great film does to you.Watching this at home on a Saturday night with the wife, my wife and I were just in awe of the whole thing. It seemed like something bad was coming, but the extent of the devastation? I think even Shakespeare himself would've been lost for words.Great writing, fantastic soundtrack, and most of all, a dream team cast that just blows you away. More films like this need to be released, but personally, I'm a Happy Go Lucky type guy, so I would prefer ones with a more positive ending.",The Best Offer
207,Psychogenic,One of the good movies of 2013,8,10 January 2014,"The Best Offer is a journey through a distorted version of reality. The amazing acting by Sylvia Hoeks & Geoffrey Rush, gives you goosebumps throughout the movie. Sylvia's enigmatic role in the movie is just beautiful. Geoffrey Rush owns his part! If I ever wanted to auction anything I would want someone like him to do it!The movie is similar to a dream that has some meaning in a series of random images. Everyone will have his own conclusion concerning the plot, because the movie functions from a multitude of angels.Although the movie moves at a slow pace, each and every part image defines the next move. All in all, it's a very enjoyable movie if you're into such genre.",The Best Offer
208,lotusduco,Just one more movie...,5,10 January 2014,"Apart from brilliant performance of Geoffrey Rush, the overall movie is such a bore. From the first part you know the end, primitive script written exactly according to the book ""how to write a million dollar script"" – all those turning points, all those ""guns on the wall"" all of which do shoot at the end, main character development, etc, all decorated by pretty ordinary professional Hollywood picture with, yes, beautiful but as just like in all ""Castle's"" products results of collaboration of just professional art designer, wardrobe, location, etc. Nothing more, nothing less, as they say.

210,minstostarbucks,A quality film,9,4 March 2014,"A film about art that is art. Not many films succeed in engaging both the mind and the emotions, but this one does both without any manipulation (or does it?). I saw it over a month ago and I still am analyzing it. I can't say anything about the emotional impact without spoiling the plot, but I thought it ""cathartic"". It has aspects to it that remind me of The Magus and The Lost Domain, both fun reads. Go watch it with your best film friends and enjoy dissecting it afterward. Is a man without relationships an automaton? Who is in control? What is real and what is a forgery? It is not a perfect film, as I found Virgil's role a bit contrived at times, and at one point I new basically what was going to happen, but the full climax still had some surprises. Time well spent.",The Best Offer
211,joanwile263,A spellbinding masterpiece,9,1 November 2014,"I was totally mesmerized by this fascinating film. I have a few questions about plot points but it doesn't matter because even though I didn't ""get"" all of it, I loved it anyway. Geoffrey Rush is marvelous -- so elegant and classy, and conveys deep emotions with a reserve befitting the character. Yet, one is aware of the depth of his feelings. In addition to terrific plot, one learns so much about the art world. Donald Sutherland is wonderful, too, in a relatively small but important role. I don't understand how I missed this film in theaters. I can only assume that it failed somewhat at the box office. I don't comprehend why, because it is vastly superior to a lot of the crap that people flock to see.",The Best Offer
212,acd-23624,"Long, slow, improbable, mediocre acting except for Rush",3,5 April 2015,"Most over-rated film of the year. Nothing happens except a plodding and improbable romance, and after sitting through two-plus hours of nothing happening, the ending is patently absurd, when everybody Geoffrey Rush has ever known turns out to have been scamming him for years. It depends upon you having the attention span of a gnat and not remembering previous scenes in the movie. Perhaps not as bad as Transformers 4, which demands you forget what happened 15 seconds earlier, but insulting to anyone who wasn't TXTing through the entire movie and not paying attention. I was insulted to be bored by the exhaustingly slow pace and then have the ridiculous bait-and-switch at the end. And even after the idiotic plot contrivance at the climax, does he go to the police and track down the easily track-downable stolen art, or the easily trace-able public figures like Donald Sutherland? No, he has lunch in a clock restaurant in Prague and then goes mad. It's amazing how some British accents and lush settings can convince Americans that a movie is High Art, when any sophomore continuity editor would have sent this back to the boys in scriptwriting 20 times. Rush is a great actor, but Sutherland, the conman, and the agoraphobic girl were all dreadful. This is C+ film-making at best.",The Best Offer
213,jimmyriddle-15041,Wonderful film with some great performances.,10,11 April 2015,"I am ashamed to say I had never heard of this movie on its theatrical release and only caught up with it when it came to satellite television and I'm very glad I took the time to view it.Geoffrey Rush puts in his usual flawless performance and really is an actor at the top of his craft.Special mention for me has to go to the performance too of Sylvia Hoeks in the role of Clare Ibbotsen, the reclusive lady who employs Rush's character to make an inventory of her works of art.We don't actually see her on screen for almost an hour and by the time we do see her, like Rush's character, the movie goer is already smitten.I won't spoil the plot or some of the twists but if you get the chance to see the movie then don't hesitate.'Deception' as it's titled when I saw it, is brilliantly directed, wonderfully acted and looks fantastic. Well worth a viewing.Also hope to see the wonderfully talented, and very beautiful Sylvia Hoeks in many more movies in the future.",The Best Offer
214,rossw-64674,Wow,10,11 December 2015,"The Best Offer, is officially my first review. It is, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant movies, from beginning to end, an absolute masterpiece! The overall theme is old, filmed a million times, and absolutely choked to death. However, this is a dramatic twist, with epic scenic displays of stunning art, psychological battles through life (accomplishments/missed opportunities), Materialism vs Human relationships. Anyone who is mature, evolved, can read between the lines, will thoroughly enjoy this movie... The acting, the script, macro/micro details, absolutely ingenuous. For those of you who have a negative opinion of this movie... I must question you maturity? Among a list of other ailments, surely your cursed. I'm sorry, time for you to grow up, and give credit where it is due. In the end, if you consider yourself well read, thoughtful, abstract, do yourself a favor and watch this one--- 10 out of 10.",The Best Offer
