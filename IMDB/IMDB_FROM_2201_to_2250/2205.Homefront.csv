0,Leofwine_draca,Adequate actioner,6,29 July 2014,"HOMEFRONT is the latest action flick from modern-day action star Jason Statham, who seems to be churning these movies out with a monotonous regularity. The good news is that the last few I've seen (SAFE, HUMMINGBIRD, PARKER) have been of a far better quality than the earlier ones (THE MECHANIC, BLITZ), so he's going in the right direction. HOMEFRONT continues that trend.The story was written by Sylvester Stallone and concerns a DEA agent who retires to New Orleans in order to bring up his daughter after the death of his wife. Inevitably, before long, the guy runs into trouble with some local drug dealers who seem to be making their own crystal meth out in the sticks. Statham is the typically tough-but-with-a-heart lead, while James Franco's casting raises eyebrows as the villain; imposing he ain't.The film in many ways feels like the star vehicles of old; Seagal's toxic-waste thriller FIRE DOWN BELOW came to mind a couple of times. It's certainly adequate enough to succeed as a movie in its own right; the action scenes are short and sweet, and the plot is interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention. And I have to say that Winona Ryder does a good job after being away from our screens for a good while. Not a classic then, and not a film with a lot of depth, but one that passes the time nonetheless.",Homefront
1,SnoopyStyle,Statham action story needs a few tweaks from Sly,6,13 February 2014,"Phil Broker (Jason Statham) is an undercover DEA agent. His last operation ends with the killing of the son of a biker gang leader. Two years later, he's left the DEA to live a quiet life in a rural town after his wife's death. However, his daughter gets into a school playground fight that slowly escalates to a battle with the local meth dealer Gator Bodine (James Franco), and eventually digging up the old score with the biker gang leader. There are some good improvements and bad changes from the usual Jason Statham action flick.First the bad, there are some slow spots. It's all very unnecessary. The story of Gator contacting the biker gang is way too complicated. It adds nothing to the story. Sending Winona Ryder to meet them was a waste of screen time. It would be better to just call up the gang and rush to get to the action quicker.Statham keeps fighting hand to hand, and it's obvious that somebody is going to come at him with a gun. I like this movie to be more realistic. The story seems to be stranded between an over the top action flick and a gritty realistic thriller. And it makes no sense for him to fight those three guys at the gas station. He's acting like his little girl wouldn't be in danger. If he beats them up, they'll just come back at his little girl. It's more reasonable if he backs up until he can't back up no more.The good part is James Franco as a villain. He's not a cartoon caricature. He is smart, devious, but he's not a blood thirsty maniac. He's simply a meth dealer. I like that he seems to be smarter than everybody else. It's a good thing that this movie tries to build a story around the action. The story actually has good potential. But writer Sylvester Stallone needs to going over it a couple of more times. Sly has a good sense with writing. But he just needs to figure out whether this is just another Statham superfighting Transporter wannabe, or a realistic action thriller of a father protecting his daughter.",Homefront
2,Prismark10,Homefront,4,1 July 2019,"Homefront is an inane formulaic hillbilly revenge film.Phil Broker (Jason Statham) was once an undercover DEA agent who decided to retire to Louisiana to live the life of a simple carpenter with his daughter.However when his daughter beats up a school bully, it unleashes hell from the local meth dealer Gator Bodine (James Franco) who is the uncle of the kid she beat up.Gator discovers that Broker was involved in the death of son of the leader of a notorious biker gang that ran a drug operation. Gator sees an opportunity to settle old scores while he can hit the big time.The film is based on an old script written by Sylvester Stallone. The story is muddled but Statham has some energetic action set pieces. Franco looks like he does not even belong in such a second rate movie.",Homefront
3,nogodnomasters,CRAZY WAITING TO HAPPEN,8,18 October 2018,"Phil Broker (Jason Statham) is a former NARC who must now lay low due to getting the son of a crime boss killed. He is living in Louisiana which allows them to use a better soundtrack and crazy characters. His wife has passed on, he has a daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) and a wanna be formulaic relationship with school counselor Susan Hatch(Rachelle Lefevre). He draws attention to himself while trying to live with a low profile, attention that endangers the life of both him and his daughter.As art imitates life, James Franco plays the crazy bad guy and Winona Ryder his trashy girlfriend.This is one of the better Statham films I have seen. It includes the usual tough guy talk, fighting, killings, chase scenes, and explosions. It also includes a colorful support cast with Kate Bosworth and Marcus Hester as realistic people. Bosworth was a pistol.Worth seeing for fans of action films.Parental Guide: F-bomb, garage sex, no nudity. Deals with meth manufacture and use.",Homefront
4,kosmasp,No way out,7,12 June 2014,"Statham tries to have a bit more meat to his roles these days and I guess you either like that fact or you hate it. Hating it for not going completely overboard and making it just a fun action movie (let's say like Crank or other stuff). But the movie still will meet your needs of action and chases (and some romance, weird and not so weird).Other than that we get Kate Bosworth and Wynona Ryder in one movie. Not that they have much to do (I'm guessing after they came on board they added a bit to their character), but it's still nice to see them. The little girl is good, but even with Franco and others around this still will depend on your view of Statham himself. Some people are apparently fed up with him, others cannot get enough of him ... what side are you on?",Homefront
5,classicsoncall,"""Now are you connecting the dots?""",7,22 January 2021,"Say what you will, but I liked this one. I think it was the kid Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) that won me over, she wasn't annoying and held her own for the most part. For Jason Statham, this wasn't much of a workout since he's been here and done that before, but this time out he looked more like just a regular guy. There's a fair share of recognizable names here and almost all are bad guys, leaving the women in somewhat of an ambiguous position at the finale. Like Winona Ryder's character Sheryl, and Kate Bosworth's Cassie. They started out pretty much as trailer trash and wound up helping Maddy in a tough spot by going with their maternal instincts to lend a hand. For Gator (James Franco), there were unintended consequences galore when he decided to try and deal with Cyrus Hanks (Frank Grillo), that guy had his own agenda without Gator moving in on his meth trafficking. I also liked Broker's (Statham) guy Teedo (Omar Benson Miller), applying new meaning to the term 'stick a fork in it'. The whole meth shop milieu was a bit too reminiscent of ""Breaking Bad"", but it did provide for a wild and fiery finale. Not a bad way of connecting all those dots.",Homefront
6,lee_eisenberg,these action flicks got boring a long time ago,2,27 April 2014,"Gary Fleder's ""Homefront"" has essentially the same plot as the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick ""Commando"": a man goes medieval to protect his daughter from evildoers. The indestructible person this time is Jason Statham as a former DEA agent in Louisiana. The only truly interesting scene was when Winona Ryder drove the boat. Gary Fleder has directed really good movies like ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Runaway Jury"", so why's he directing this predictable crap? You might say ""But this movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't"". Maybe so. However, I'd like to see more movies about historical events. Since we're talking about Louisiana here, how about a movie about the 1811 German Coast Uprising, in which large numbers of slaves marched across the Pelican State before white militias opened fire on them? That would make for a much more interesting story than another movie in which a single person turns superhero. Just avoid ""Homefront"".",Homefront
7,jboothmillard,Homefront,4,4 May 2016,"I think the main reason I wanted to see this average sounding film was because the amount of good people in the cast, I had my expectations about what it may be like, produced by Sylvester Stallone, directed by Gary Fleder (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Kiss the Girls, Don't Say a Word, Runaway Jury). Basically former DEA agent Phil Broker (Jason Statham) had his cover blown two years ago during the raid of a gang's meth lab, he and his daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) moved to the small Louisiana town where Maddy's deceased mother grew up. Maddy gets into a schoolyard fight with bully Teddy Klum (Austin Craig), there Broker meets Teddy's hostile father Jimmy (Marcus Hester), they fight and Jimmy loses. Cassie Bodine Klum (Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth) later asks her drug dealer brother Morgan 'Gator' Bodine (James Franco) to scare Broker, he is threatened by Gator's thugs at a gas station, but fights them off. While Broker and his daughter are horseback riding, Gator breaks into their house and discovers that Broker was an undercover cop in the raid two years earlier, Danny T (Chuck Zito) was arrested, hoping to increase his distribution of drugs Gator tips off Danny T so he can find Broker and kill him. Broker finds Gator's meth lab and sabotages it, he is captured and tortured by the same gang from earlier, but again manages to fight them off and escape, they later return, he kills most of the gang members, but Maddy is kidnapped, but not before she makes a call. Broker deduces from her call that she has been taken to Gator's meth lab, which Cassie unintentionally causes to be destroyed, after setting off a booby trap set up by Broker, Gator watches his business go up in flames, and whilst fleeing with Maddy accidentally shoots Cassie. A chase ensues until Gator is stuck on a bridge closed off, Broker fights Gator until he is beaten badly, he stops himself from killing the drug dealer as his daughter is watching, in the end Gator is arrested, Broker visits Danny T in prison and lets him know he will be around when he is eventually released. Also starring Winona Ryder as Sheryl Marie Mott, Frank Grillo as Cyrus Hanks, Rachelle Lefevre as Susan Hetch, Clancy Brown as Sheriff Keith Rodrigue, Omar Benson Miller as Teedo, Christa Campbell as Lydia and Pruitt Taylor Vince as Werks. Statham is fairly the same as his previous British hard man characters, maybe with some small tender moments, Franco is alright a the bad guy, and Ryder and Bosworth I agree with critics are inconsistent, to be honest I drifted many times throughout, perhaps because it's rather predictable, the whole former federal agent against drug dealers thing I've seen a few times before, only some fight and chase scenes picked it up slightly, overall it's a very average action crime thriller. Okay, in my opinion!",Homefront
8,Tweekums,A school yard punch up quickly escalates in the Jason Statham action thriller,7,19 May 2017,"Phil Broker was a DEA agent who went deep undercover in a biker gang to expose their drug dealing operation; now he has retired to a quiet town in the Louisiana bayous. He is hoping for a quiet life with his young daughter Maddy but an apparently minor incident rapidly escalates to the point that his old foes are coming after him. A schoolyard bully picks on Maddy but gets more than he bargained for when she gives him a bloody nose. The boy's mother pushes her husband into confronting Broker but he just ends up being put on the floor. This just makes matters worse; after her husband's humiliation she gets her vicious crystal meth dealing brother, 'Gator', involved. He discovers Broker's true identity and decides that he can use this to get the bikers, who want revenge against Broker, to get them to distribute his product. When they arrive mayhem is inevitable.This is a fairly routine Jason Statham action thriller; there are few real surprises but as one would expect the action is pretty impressive with lots of fights, shooting and a fairly spectacular explosion near the end. The story is decent enough and the characters are fun to watch; we are in little doubt as to which side most characters are but there are a few more ambiguous characters including a sheriff who has been turning a blind to Gator and some 'bad guys' who think things are going too far when young Maddy is threatened. Jason Statham puts in a solid performance as Broker and James Franco is pretty good as Gator. Young Izabela Vidovic impressed as Maddy. The rest of the cast were pretty solid although Winona Ryder was somewhat underused. Overall this is hardly a must see but if you just want a decent action film and are a fan of Jason Statham then it is worth checking out.",Homefront
9,paul_haakonsen,Even a Gator can be brought down by a firm punch...,7,26 February 2014,"""Homefront"" does have a good storyline, but as with all Jason Statham movies, you know exactly what you get here; one guy against overwhelming odds, and coming out victorious. Predictable? Yes. But still great entertainment.Having said that, then I will also say that I am a fan of Jason Statham and his movies, as they are action packed and filled with masculine adrenaline. Sure, the movies tend to follow a similar build-up, but they are still enjoyable.The story in ""Homefront"" is about an undercover police officer whose cover is blown during a gunfight. Moving to a new location with his daughter, Phil Broker (played by Jason Statham) starts a new life. But things from the past catch up with him and he finds himself standing face to face not only with the local meth pusher Gator (played by James Franco) but also bikers from the past where his cover was compromised.The action in ""Homefront"" is right on the spot, fast paced and constant. And the action scenes are nicely executed and Jason Statham delivers a hard-hitting punch as usual.""Homefront"" is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, especially if you like Jason Statham's typical movies. And the good storyline does really help the movie along quite nicely.",Homefront

11,LeonLouisRicci,Familiar and Uninspired,6,9 April 2014,"Director Gary Fleder seems to be on Autopilot here in this Lackluster and Familiar Film with Jason Statham Delivering the Kicks and Punches and Smoldering Athleticism that is Expected. But the Movie is Uninspired Despite some Cartoonish Side Characters that are Mildly Interesting.Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth, and New Kid Actor Izabela Vidovic (what a name!) all Females of Course, Ironically Lend a bit of Pizazz as the Male Actors just kind of show up with not much Gusto. The Worst is A-List James Franco that is not up to the Task of the Role and is Miscast and is Weak and Unthreatening and Looks at Times to be Constipated and Bored.The Sly Stallone Script is of No Great Concern because it is Formulaic and Familiar to the Point of Numbing Comfortableness. The Film just goes from one Scene to Another with barely enough Momentum to get it to the Predictable and Unremarkable End. The Meth Lab Blowing Up in the Background does not even Distract the Characters in the Foreground as if they were Unaware that the Cliché would be Inserted in Post Production.Overall, it is Worth a Watch for Statham Fans and Action Junkies and Delivers the Required Body Count of Scum, but the Weak Direction from a Usually ""on his game"" Fleder is Disappointing.",Homefront
12,CinemaSerf,"Watchable, but definitely not Jace at his best...",6,12 June 2020,"This is much grittier and angrier than your usual Jason Statham thriller - and at times I found it just a bit too nasty. He has the usual hard luck back story - this time as a former DEA agent involved in a confrontation with a biker gang that ended up claiming the life of his boss's son so he decides to escape from it all with his 9 year old daughter. Of course, trouble is never going to be very far away and after his daughter has an altercation with a bully at school he faces quite a lot of local resentment, especially from the boy's mother and her boyfriend, the local meth-dealer ""Gator Bodine"" (James Franco). Franco doesn't ever quite make it as a villain and here his character lacks the ruthlessness needed; Winona Ryder and Kate Bosworth both feature too, but again they don't really have their hearts in it. It's still pretty much end-to-end stuff, but maybe I have just seen too many of these Statham films now because this, despite a better cast than many, just isn't very good...",Homefront
13,utgard14,Flawed But Mostly Entertaining,6,22 February 2014,"There are spoilers ahead so if you don't want to read them you might want to skip this review. Jason Statham plays a former DEA agent/widower/single dad who's retired to raise his daughter in a small Southern town. His daughter defends herself against a bully whose parents take it out on Statham, who in turn defends himself and embarrasses the dad. This sets things in motion that leads to a conflict between Statham and local drug dealer James Franco. The cast here is really good and way better than most movies like this would get. In addition to Statham, who could do this role in his sleep, and Franco, whose performances are always interesting, you have Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth, and Clancy Brown. Not a bad lineup at all.The story is by-the-numbers stuff but that's OK sometimes. There is a great deal of tension throughout the movie, although admittedly I never felt deep down it would turn out any other way than it did. But the movie kept me interested enough that I didn't dwell on that. There are some plot contrivances and worse there are loose ends that are never satisfactorily wrapped up. Also, somewhat surprisingly, very few people get killed. Movies like this usually have an obligatory death, like a friend or girlfriend of the hero, that serve to ""up the stakes"" leading to the climax. But here, there are just teases of that. The tease of the cat's death, the tease of the black best friend's death, and so on. Even the bad guys mostly survive. The only ones that die are the ones played by no-name actors. I'm not saying this as a criticism, just that it's unique for a movie of this type not to have a massive body count at the end. I found it noteworthy as you don't see it a lot. Anyway, a solid action thriller that will do in a pinch if you're looking to kill an hour and a half. Statham fans are unlikely to be disappointed.",Homefront
14,zardoz-13,Statham Kicks Butt Again!!!,8,29 November 2013,"Don't let the title of the latest Jason Statham thriller ""Homefront"" deceive you. This is no soap opera about life in the boondocks. ""Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead"" director Gary Fleder and ""Cobra"" scenarist Sylvester Stallone should have entitled it ""Hell On A Bayou."" This exciting but formulaic revenge saga pits a retired DEA Agent against a murderous bunch of bikers and rednecks who resemble the hellions in the ""Sons of Anarchy"" television series. Naturally, Statham plays the conscientious DEA Agent who witnessed a gross miscarriage of justice that his superior defends as 'protocol.' After an explosive drug bust at a New Orleans' nightclub, our undercover hero's brothers-in-blue mow down a clueless biker in a fusillade of gunfire. Apparently, they suspected that the poor slob was reaching for a concealed weapon during a stand-off. The blood-splattered experience sickened our protagonist enough that he resigned from the agency and settled down in a two-bit Louisiana town to raise his young daughter. While he wants to put as much distance between his past as he can, our hero doesn't realize that escaping his bullet-riddled past is easier said than done. Basically, ""Homefront"" shares a lot in common with a witness relocation thriller, except the hero here is a cop rather than an eye-witness. Stallone adapted Chuck Logan's novel, but the filmmakers have altered the setting from Minnesota to Louisiana. A former Vietnam veteran, Logan has published eight novels about his protagonist Phil Broker, and ""Homefront"" appeared in print back in 2009. As it turns out, ""Homefront"" provides Statham with an ideal vehicle, and its rural setting and dastardly villains have the flavor of an Elmore Leonard novel. Co-stars James Franco, Winona Ryder, Clancy Brown, Kate Bosworth, and Frank Grillo constitute a first-class cast for this gritty, hard-boiled, methamphetamine melodrama.Everything goes wrong for our hero when his nine-year old daughter Maddy (newcomer Izabela Vidovic) picks on the wrong bully at her elementary school. Fat Teddy Klum (Austin Craig) not only steals Maddy's baseball cap, but he also terrorizes the willowy little darling on the playground. Maddy warns Teddy twice to hand her cap back, but Teddy chuckles contemptuously at the defiant little waif. Imagine Teddy's surprise when Maddy socks him in the snout and knocks him on his obese butt! Phil Broker (Jason Statham of ""Safe"") is remodeling a house with his African-American partner Teedo (Omar Benson Miller of ""8 Mile"") when he receives a call from the Rayville Elementary School. School psychologist Susan Hetch (Rachelle Lefevre of ""Twilight"") briefs Broker about the incident, and Sheriff Keith Rodrigue (Clancy Brown of ""Highlander"") struggles to keep Teddy's mom Cassie Bodine Klum (Kate Bosworth of ""Straw Dogs"") off Broker's back. When she cannot slap Broker around, Cassie incites her husband Jimmy (Marcus Hester of ""Lawless"") to rough him up. Broker puts Jimmy out of action with the ease of a kung fu master, and the sheriff wonders where our hero got his training. Later, Cassie resorts to her scumbag brother, Gator (James Franco of ""Spring Breakers""), to take care of Broker. Teedo warns Broker that Gator operates a local meth factory and discourages any competitors by informing on them to Sheriff Rodrigue. Gator burglarizes Broker's remote house in the middle of the woods and stumbles upon Broker's files from his DEA days. Furthermore, he discovers Broker was the anonymous snitch that sent Outcast motorcycle gang member Danny T Turrie (Chuck Zito of ""Carlito's Way"") to prison and put the first of the 47 bullets into Danny's worthless son Jojo (Linds Edwards) on the street in New Orleans. Gator concocts a hare-brained scheme with low-life waitress Sheryl Marie Mott (Winona Ryder of ""Heathers"") to alert the Outcasts about Broker's whereabouts. Gator dreams in his naive mind that the Outcasts will repay him for his friendly little tip by helping him distribute his meth. Outcast motorcycle chieftain Cyrus Hanks (Frank Grillo of ""Disconnect"") and his best bangers roll into Rayville with payback on their brains. Meanwhile, our hero realizes that he is living in a land where feuding is a way of life. At the last minute, after Gator has stolen Maddy's pet kitten, Broker smells the stench of murder in the air and tries to clear out. Unfortunately, our hero doesn't get far before he discovers that there is too much lead in the air for him to hightail it without jeopardizing his daughter's life.Mind you, ""Homefront"" would be just another entertaining but predictable shoot'em up, but director Gary Fleder has assembled a knock-out cast of celebrity talent and orchestrated some crowd pleasing action scenes. James Franco plays Statham's grinning redneck adversary with gusto galore. At one point, he chides Phil Broker because our hero doesn't ""smell the wood burning"" and ""cannot connect the dots."" Winona Ryder gives an electrifying performance as Gator's scummy ex-convict accomplice who served time for smuggling narcotics into Angola Prison. Topping both Franco and Ryder is sexy Kate Bosworth of ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Blue Crush"" as a housewife hooked on meth who ridicules her husband into doing what she cannot. Seasoned character actor Clancy Brown emerges from the background a corrupt local sheriff who behaves with more discretion than the usual paid-off politician. Essentially, nobody gives a bad performance in ""Homefront,"" and the children are incredibly convincing, too. Of course, Fleder and Stallone shoot the works, and Statham displays his usual physical prowess. Basically, if you enjoy watching the ""Transporter"" kick the crap out of his antagonists after they threaten his daughter, you'll enjoy ""Homefront."" The close encounter combat sequence between our hero and two thugs at a local gas station is hilariously violent. Statham is quickly turning into the new Steven Segal with the effortless aplomb with which he dispatches his opponents. Dutch lenser Theo van de Sande's cinematography of the swampy Louisiana locations is simply gorgeous; Sande shot the Wesley Snipes vampire opus ""Blade."" Clocking in at a nimble 100 minutes, ""Homefront"" never wears out its welcome.",Homefront

Fair Statham vehicle streamlined for his ass-kicking form as an ex-DEA agent attempting a new life with his daughter (Vidovic) in Louisiana only finds themselves butting heads with the local meth kingpin (Franco, laughably miscast) whose kin has him in the mix after a schoolyard altercation mushrooms into high-stakes vengeance. Based on Chuck Logan's book and adapted by Statham bud Sylvester Stallone the screenplay at best plays to the strengths of its star's implosive kineticism.

So it all gets a bit personal and nasty.This is fairly standard Jason Statham stuff, featuring a good cast and James Franco. The more I see of Franco, the less he impresses me. Gator is supposed to be a razor's edge scary loonie: Franco never scares, he is far too lightweight. But otherwise this is decent, if routine, Statham action stuff as long as you are prepared to overlook: Statham's usual wandering accent, partly US, partly London; Clancy Brown's underused cop; Vast quantities of completely unnecessary bad language - every other word at times, and distractingly superfluous); The dangling plot line of the budding romance with the student counsellor; The nagging question of how come the teachers failed to see what was going on at recess before Maddy decked Cassie's kid.",Homefront

View on the film:Originally written to be the basis for the 5th title in his Rambo series,the screenplay by Sylvester Stallone (based on a novel by Chuck Logan) gives the movie a sweet Country feel,with Stallone showing that the only time matters in the area are sorted in the board room,is when a resident sees the chance to hit someone with the boardroom table!While the relationship between the Broker family is a bit sickly sweet,Stallone keeps the action moving at a frantic pace,thanks to Stallone showing the villain's to cut any corners in order to get hold of Phil Broker,and also to unexpectedly showing the baddies having a serious sense of doubt,over if they may have gone too far in getting hold of their target.Basking the film with lush green surroundings,director Gary Fleder uses the relaxing setting as a way to give the gripping action scenes a scotching hot atmosphere.Tearing apart the Broker's ""quiet life"" image,Fleder scatters the film with drops of blood and uses quick paced camera moves to show each of the punches and gunshots to strike with a real force.Whilst not doing anything close to a US accent, Jason Statham gives a rugged performance as Phil Broker,with Statham showing Broker's sense of calm to be one that quickly burns out,the moment Phil realizes that he has to revive his brutal DEA training.Taking on Stanham,James Franco shows himself to be an excellent creep as ""Gator"",with Franco showing Gator's desperation in his dried up eyes,as Gator fights to protect his homefront.",Homefront
18,anaconda-40658,Homefront dreadful.,2,10 February 2016,"Homefront (2013): Dir: Gary Fleder / Cast: Jason Statham, James Franco, Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth, Chuck Zito: Idiotic action thriller about what matters most either to the hero or to the locals. It stars Jason Statham as an undercover cop who uncover a meth operation and a shootout erupts that results in the death of the son of the guy he is taking down. Cut ahead a couple years and widowed Statham moves his young daughter to a small town where trouble begins when his daughter beats the tar out of the school bully. The parents of the bully confront Statham despite his willingness to make amends. This is standard issue crap that consists of numerous scenes of Statham beating locals like a pinata at a birthday party. When a motorcycle gang makes an attempt on him it becomes laughable as each moron meets a tragic encounter due to stupidity. Gary Fleder previous made Kiss the Girls and Runaway Jury. This is definitely not a step up. We have great talent doing formula garbage. Statham does combat. James Franco plays the bad ass villain out to scare Statham and predictably gets his ass handed to him. Winona Ryder plays Franco's stripper girlfriend who kidnaps Statham's daughter in a laughable sequence. Kate Bosworth had potential as the bully's mother on drugs who is Franco's sister. Unfortunately her screen time becomes distant as it drones on. Chuck Zito plays the gang leader in the film's opening when Statham is undercover. Its theme of bullying is a shield for the film's real deal, which is Statham doubling bad guys as punching bags and soccer balls. Score: 2 / 10",Homefront

20,phd_travel,Top notch cast make this solid thriller very entertaining,8,5 December 2013,"This is an entertaining well paced and satisfying thriller about a ex undercover agent (Jason Statham) who goes to live in a small town in swamp land. A small school fight escalates into the criminals from his past catching up with him Getting A list cast like James Franco, Winona Ryder, and Kate Bosworth to do white trash is a good move. Kate is very convincing and shows she has versatility. James is a bit too clean cut looking for trash still but it's explained in the dialog - ""he doesn't look like much but ..."". Having these people who are usually the heroes or heroines as bad guys is effective because it makes you feel anxious for both sides. Liked Rachelle Lefevre as a school teacher. She is pretty and was a bit under used.Sylvester Stallone has written a clear screenplay where the plot and motives are all easy to understand. Don't like thrillers which are too confusing. There is a good balance between slower moments to get into the characters and action sequences which aren't too over the top that it is ridiculous.Couple of minor faults.

Set in the smarmy swamplands of the Bayou, a location that adds immensely to the atmosphere of the drama, this is a film that for some reason was overlooked in the theaters (likely a timing release problem). It is full of fine ideas and is brought to life by a very strong cast of well known and not so well known but very competent actors: with Jason Statham at the helm we can be assured it will be a action packed brutal survey of crime and its manifestations.Phil Broker Jason Statham is a former DEA agent who has gone through a crisis after his action against a biker gang went horribly wrong and it cost the life of his boss' son. He is recently widowed and is left with a 9-year-old daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), and deciding to step out of the dangerous life of a NARC agent he moves to his deceased wife's quit town for Maddy's sake. Maddy draws attention when she has a confrontation with the school bully (Austin Craig) whose parents (Marcus Hester and Kate Bosworth – in a surprisingly fine role) cause trouble setting into motion a series of events that ends in his direct confrontation with the local Meth drug lord Gator (James Franco – excellent!) whose addicted sister happens to be Kate Bosworth. Broker's past history with the biker gang also enters the arena, making matters more complex. But he has a mission in his mind to protect his daughter and he is ready to pay any cost that it demands, despite the fact that the local sheriff (Clancy Brown) is in cahoots with the Meth gang. One of Gator's kind, Cyrus (Frank Grillo) and his girlfriend, the sleazy Sheryl (Winona Rider), are brought into the picture to kill Broker, a kidnapping takes place and an attack on Gator's Meth lab ends in a whale of a combustion that only lights up the surprising final scenes. Yes, this is a rather grisly film about a disturbing subject, but the performances by Statham, Franco, Bosworth, Ryder, Vidovic, Susan Hetch as the school psychologist and love interest, and Grillo are excellent and the supporting cast is rich in terrifying characters portrayed by a fine supporting cast.

22,deloudelouvain,Yeah yeah i'm a mean mean fighting machine,5,1 March 2017,"The thing is with a Jason Statham movie is that you absolutely know what you will get. I don't think he ever made another movie and I doubt he could actually. It's basically always the same pattern with a slightly different story. Without spoiling anything, except if you never saw a Jason Statham movie before, he's a bad ass good guy that did pretty bad stuff to others because he's so awesome, and so he creates a ton of enemies all out for revenge. He then decides to quit that thug life and tries to be the good role model in his community but somehow at one point his past finds him and he needs to teach everybody a lesson again on how you don't mess with Statham or his family. At first it's always a gentle warning, and the bad guys don't get that, so then he has to go in full-Statham-mode and destroy everybody without him having a scratch. That's about it. If you don't like those kind of revenge stories just don't watch the Statham movies because that's basically what you get every time. I only scored it a five because it lacks originality and the acting skills aren't that great. The action is okay but all predictable. I might have scored it a bit more if it was my first Statham movie but it isn't, so there you go.",Homefront
23,siderite,"Predictable Statham movie, but with some subtle messages throughout",7,3 March 2014,"If you are going to the movie with the desire to see Jason Statham kicking behinds, you will get your wish. For reasons of being too badass, he relocates with his daughter to a remote place infested with hillbillies. Them being what they are, they have to talk about his little girl with little political correctness and thus slightly annoy Statham. A lot of behind kicking ensues.Now, sorry for spoiling the entire marvelous plot, but I thought the thing that made the movie stand out a little was the bits of emotional maturity that were peppered, much too rarely, throughout the movie. The little girl was taught to defend herself against bullies. When her father is called to school, he is not backing down to social pressure, nor does he stop giving support to his daughter's actions, since they were grounded in reason.The junkie white thrash woman that causes most of the trouble just by blabbing her big mouth stops being such a bitch when the line is crossed and defends a little girl in distress, no matter who she is. The father of the bully and unfortunate husband of said woman is the poster child of hillbillies, but he is actually a non violent guy that just wants people to treat him right.As for James Franco's character, it is complex and quite the driver of the entire plot. These little deviations from the typical storyline of bad versus badass make the film just entertaining enough to not stop it and do something else.You will be surprised by the cast, as well. Winona Ryder seems to never really age; James Franco, of course, playing the cunning local drug dealer with dreams of greatness; Clancy Brown has a small role as the sheriff; Kate Bosworth is the loud mouthed woman; you will also probably recognize Omar Benson Miller or Linds Edwards. Of course, except for Statham and perhaps Franco, no one is of real note, but still.Bottom line: a completely predictable and kind of silly plot mixed with bits of a better script and well built characters. It's like two screenwriters were doing the story (or one manager and a screenwriter). It is not the best action movie you have ever seen, but it is entertaining enough.",Homefront

25,Hellmant,I miss these 80s style action films.,8,2 December 2013,"'HOMEFRONT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sylvester Stallone produced and wrote this action thriller (based on the book of the same name by Chuck Logan). He was planning on starring in the film himself but instead handed over the role to his buddy (and current action star favorite) Jason Statham. Statham is his usual ultimate badass self in the film and goes up against none other than James Franco as the movie's main bad guy! The cast also includes Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth, Frank Grillo and Clancy Brown! It's about a retired DEA agent looking to escape the dangerous life of fighting crime by moving himself and his young daughter in to a small town. Trouble once again finds him in the form of a small time meth drug-lord, who's looking to expand his business. The script is pretty routine but the action and performances are topnotch. Definitely worth seeing for any Statham fan or action movie junkie.Statham plays an undercover DEA agent, named Phil Broker, who helps bust a biker gang which sends the leader, 'Danny T' (Chuck Zito), to prison. 'Danny T's son is also killed during the bust and Danny blames Broker for it. 2 years later, after Phil's wife passes away, he moves himself and his daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) to a small town in order to retire and live a quiet life. When Maddy defends herself against a bully at school, and embarrasses him, the bully's mom (Bosworth) asks her meth dealing brother 'Gator' (Franco) to scare the Brokers. 'Gator' soon finds out who Broker really is, in the process of messing with him, and decides to use the information he finds to help expand his business. Broker of course has to beat up a lot of bad guys to get himself out of trouble once again.I miss these 80s style action films; the type that Stallone and Schwarzenegger used to star in. When those guys used to do a movie it was an event and made a ton of money. Now the most popular action star in Hollywood (Statham) can't even open a movie like this to $10 million! It's a shame that the majority of moviegoers would rather see a fake tough guy 'pretty boy' CGI-ed into an action hero role than watch the real thing (and Statham is definitely the real thing). If you want a real 80s style kick-ass action film than this is the movie for you and Statham definitely delivers the goods (once again). Franco is also a delight to watch as the despicable meth dealing villain and his diverse career (with him doing wildly different roles in every movie) keeps getting more and more impressive. Ryder, Bosworth and all the rest are good in the film as well. Everyone's a standout in it (at least the principal actors are). Gary Fleder (who also directed thrillers like 'RUNAWAY JURY', 'KISS THE GIRLS', 'DON'T SAY A WORD' and 'THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD') did a fine job directing the movie and it definitely delivered everything I expected from it.

27,Robert_duder,Saved from complete monotony by a strong cast,7,30 November 2013,"Homeland is about as by the book as you can get. At each twist, turn and climax you'll find it predictable, offering absolutely nothing new to the thriller/action genre. That's about the worse thing I can say about the film though. I was very surprised by the quality of the performances in the film. There is also nothing wrong with following a tried and true recipe with a film. For those of us that gravitate regularly to a certain genre we enjoy and feel comforted by the familiar and so Homefront's fault is also what makes it work ironically. I have tried for the last year to avoid trailers for the most part but I wasn't sure I would see this one right away so I watched a few of the trailers and literally the entire film is contained in the trailers. There is very little you miss and that is truly unfortunate. The plot is okay but drags a little bit and the action scenes often feel just a little disjointed or forced. It is a good movie and it does entertain but it fails to blow you away or really captivate you. Its the sort of movie that had it been released straight to video I would have been impressed by its quality but as a theatrical release it falls just short of being really good.Jason Statham is really a hit and miss sort of guy for me. Sometimes he really nails it (Transporter, The Mechanic, The Expendables) and other times he really misses his mark. This is somewhere up the middle but the cast including him are not the issue. Statham is actually terrific as the former DEA Undercover agent turned adoring father. Its not exactly a leap for him from other roles but he does what he does best and has some of his trademark amazing action scenes. I admit that I'm a little James Franco'd out. It feels like the guy is doing EVERYTHING and despite often being a good to great actor, there is no need to over-saturate yourself. Franco is decent as the villainous small town meth dealer. His character is not quite big and bad enough to be the main villain but its also sort of the point because he is small time but twisted enough to cause damage. He is good in the role and him and Statham have decent adversarial chemistry. Young Izabela Vidovic is fantastic as Statham's daughter. She has some emotional scenes and even her action scenes are terrific. She truly does a phenomenal job. Winona Ryder was twisted and terrific as Franco's love interest and a villain in her own right. This was probably one of Ryder's best roles in years and she absolutely commands the screen when she's on it so bravo to her for her comeback. Kate Bosworth was also disturbingly amazing as the meth head mother who is first to confront Statham. She looks awful and did a terrific job at it. If this weren't a mainstream, run of the mill action flick I would suggest Supporting Oscars for both her and Ryder...I liked their performances that much. I love character actors Clancy Brown and Omar Miller but their characters are incredibly small but effective in their purpose. Also can't get enough of the lovely Rachelle Lefevre in a very small role as Statham's potential love interest, though that never actually goes anywhere.Sylvester Stallone is my Hollywood idol. I've loved the guy more than the average joe since I was about 13. He is a talented writer but this does nothing to show off that talent. This is very by the book and stereotypical and probably would have starred him twenty plus years ago. Good for him though for passing the mantle to a younger actor. They actually got a very good director in Gary Fleder who has done some outstanding thrillers early in his career. I place the ho-hum nature of this film squarely on the script/screenplay (sorry Sly...I really do idolize you.) Still, action fans and fans of Statham can feel vindicated by the fact that the cast is so strong and it is watchable. It is just unfortunate that its also forgettable and turns in a medium bout of entertainment at best. 7/10",Homefront
28,bowmanblue,Meet 'Jambo',7,22 May 2014,"The one thing I knew about 'Homefront' before I watched it was the, originally, Sylvester Stallone was attached to the project and had notions of turning it into part of his 'Rambo' franchise. However, as he was getting on in age, he passed on it, handing it over to his Expendables co-star, Jason Statham. So, meet a hybrid of Rambo and Jason – 'Jambo!' Here, the 'Stath' drops his attempts at putting on an American accent and plays an (oddly British) DEA agent who moves to a small town with his daughter to escape some particularly nasty drug lords. However, Jambo, never being one to shy away from trouble, soon finds himself at odds with the local rednecks (and yet more drug-type nasties). These come in the form of James Franco and Winona Ryder, both of who don't seem to put as much menace in their performances as their acting abilities dictate they could have done. Kate Bosworth does well at portraying one of the 'white-trash' locals - in fact... she plays her part a little too well. I had to look at her name in the credits to find out it was actually her! Don't expect too much 'Transporter-esque' punching and kicking in the fight scenes. It's more on a par of what you'd see in your average Arnie/Sly action movie of the eighties. Plus there's quite a few clichés the movie adheres to, i.e. Stath's black best friend (and we all know what happens to black best friends in Hollywood), plus the fact that Stath is a single parent who obviously meets the one beautiful, single woman in the town who's totally into single fathers.If you're a fan of the Stath in general, this will be a reasonable addition to your collection of his work. Plus seeing as some of his recent efforts (baring Expendables movies) have been a little 'samey.' Plus Homefront is also a solid little action thriller which should keep fans of the genre happy. Just don't expect anything too groundbreaking, only some harmless head-slitting from our balding, British baddass.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Homefront
29,g-bodyl,A Good Action Film!,8,13 January 2015,"Homefront is a solid action movie, and even though I typically enjoy Jason Statham movies, it's nice to see a change of pace for him. It's a different kind of film he partakes here. There are still many action scenes, but this is more of a slow-burn thriller that has an explosive finale. It's weird to see Statham playing a character that has existing family, because I'm so used to him working solo. As action movies goes, I have seen better, but I have also seen far worst.Gary Fleder's film is about a former DEA agent named Phil Broker who lives with his daughter in a small town of Louisiana. When his daughter kicks the crap out of a bullying classmate, the town goes in an uproar. Because of this uproar, the hidden past of Broker is now about to come alive.This film features the unlikely pairing of Statham and James Franco. Statham does a good job here playing a more reserved man, but he still has the moves. James Franco does a good job as a drug dealer named Gator Bodine. We also get solid performances out of Winona Ryder as Gator's hooker friend, and Kate Bosworth as the crazy mother of the kid who was beaten up by Broker's daughter.Overall, Homefront is a good movie. It was entertaining, and Sylvester Stallone's script actually does the film justice. The movie did move kind of slow and there were some issues with the plot. For example, I would have loved to see more of a romantic subplot between Broker and his daughter's school psychiatrist. The film hinted at it, but nothing else. But the action is satisfactory and so is the film itself. Bottom line is never mess with Jason Statham, especially when his daughter goes missing. I rate this film 8/10.",Homefront
30,A_Different_Drummer,"A real ""guilty pleasure""",8,16 December 2013,"I enjoyed this film. But, to be fair, they have been making this specific type of film since the 70s and I enjoyed them then, I enjoy them now. (Back in the day, this would have been a Charles Bronson film, or Chuck Norris film, or a Lee Marvin film). No I will not mislead you or tell you untruths. This is not an original story. It is a specific story which, depending on the actors and the direction, either works or does not work. Films like this never make it to the Oscars and often they don't do well in reviews either. But they can be fun. If you read the other reviews you already know the backstory -- the reason this specific formula was resurrected from the Script Graveyard and given the A-List treatment -- it was written/developed by Sly Stallone. Sly is too slick and too smart to let any property sit idle, so he ""slyly"" (sorry) picked Statham to play the lead. Once again, before anyone takes exception, I will note that my review of Hummingbird -- the first major film where Statham showed his acting ""chops"" -- was very popular in this database, so I feel entitled to make a final call. Which is this -- good movie. Could have been great, but it did OK, considering the part was not originally written for the actor who played the main role. And the heavies were (to be fair) just a tad over-written. I mean, if you have ever watched Justfied, you already know that the friendly overweight woman who runs the General Store in back mountain country is probably a serial killer. And the local deputy is corrupt and related to the judge. So, with such a rich assortment to draw upon, why import heavies? Final comment: I thought Izabela Vidovic as the daughter stole every scene she was in, most especially the opening (which arguably -- and this is not unusual in action films -- was the best single setup in the production) where she whips the snot out of a local bully who is twice her size after patiently and earnestly explaining to him that she warned him -- twice.",Homefront

Before I start I have to admit that I am a Jason Statham fan so that may affect my review. On the other hand even though I like him he pretty much does the same movie over and over. That said this one is different from the others...for the most part. The movie makes you feel tense and on edge almost the entire time because of the fact that the daughter is in the middle of what is happening. Even though James Franco is the ""bad guy"" in the movie Kate Bosworth is really the one to watch. Her character is the reason I felt tense and is the scariest of all of them. The movie is very believable and the fact that nothing is too over the top makes it that much more tense.

As a rewatch 07/14/18' Homefront is decent at what it is. It is more of a slow paced drama than a typical action film, though there are of course sequences of action fighting provided by Jason Statham.

Jason Statham who must surely be getting bored with his typecasting no matter what the sums of his undoubtedly good pay cheques here has some good moments as grizzled ex-undercover cop turned lone parent Phil Broker and is ably backed up by newcomer Izabela Vidovic as his daughter Maddy, but it's in the redneck/drug addict/criminals that the film finds some much needed spark.Supporting once more what can only be described as Hollywood's most questionable facial hair, James Franco has a real blast as the lead villain of the piece Gator (not to be confused with his Spring Breakers bad man Alien). Chewing up his dialogue and enjoying a love hate relationship with his girl Sheryl played by the nearly unrecognizable Winona Ryder, Franco is on fine fun form and is almost outmatched by his movie sister in the form of scarily skinny and against type Kate Bosworth as drug addled backwoods mum Cassie. Bosworth is on such fine form here that you almost wish her character had a much larger part in proceedings and if that were the case you feel Homefront could of leap frogged it's pretty stock standard dealings.Not your typical Jason Statham action rout from start to finish and playing along at a nice pace, Homefront is never in the slightest bit believable or overly memorable but it is a solid action/thriller that plays host to some very fun and committed supporting turns and therefore remains a lot more entertaining than your average Friday night action movie treat.2 and a half playground stoushes out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Homefront

After retiring from being an undercover cop, he seeks a peaceful life with his daughter in a small town, but it doesn't take long before his past catches up with him. It's everything that you expect from a movie in this genre. Statham isn't really known for his outstanding acting skills, so there's know surprise with his performance. The storyline is predictable from the beginning to the end and with Slyvester Stallone writing and producing the movie, you just know that he's going to add in some kick-ass scenes. Basically, it's what it says on the tin so don't expect anything amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: I was surprised to see Winona Ryder and James Franco. It really does show that there careers are questionable at the moment when your second billed to Statham. James Franco played the red neck quite well, but he wasn't that convincing as a hard nut after seeing him in Oz doing magic. As for Winona Ryder, she just can't get her career back on track after falling of the rails. She hasn't been given the chance to take the lead for some time and she keeps on popping up in movies doing these small roles, maybe for the pay day. Jason Statham seems to have taken over from Sly & Arnie and as long as his movies make there money back, I'm sure that there are many more to come.Budget: $22million Worldwide Gross: $43millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there typical Statham movies were he's going against the bad guys. 4/10",Homefront
40,TheMovieDiorama,Homefront is easily one of Statham's stronger action dramas.,6,16 May 2018,"With every film I watch of his, my admiration for him heightens to explosive levels. His commitment to the stunt work, the cheesy one liners, the mediocre American accent. He negates the critics and just does what he does best, being Jason Statham. Homefront is no different, but he has much better support. Having recently moved to a new town, a father and his daughter are embroiled in a feud with another family that soon escalates into a murderous plan for drug distribution. Bearing in mind this a screenplay adapted by Sylvester Stallone (who is no Shakespeare) and directed by Gary Fleder (yeah, me neither...), it's a damn enjoyable action drama. Illustrating the affection and protectiveness between father and daughter, shrouding these two strangers in a small community and portraying the lust for money and success from a crazed lunatic who is willing to shoot his own relatives and flee the scene. This isn't a Statham film where he is invincible, jumping out skyscraper windows landing on his feet with barely a scratch on him. No, he is actually human. A father just trying to move on with his life and avoid trouble. But alas, trouble always finds him, and so Statham does what Statham does best: annihilate the enemy. The violence is pretty damn edgy, where every punch, kick and gun shot feels surprisingly real. I've never seen so many head smashes into car windows in a film, however the result is strangely captivating. It's gritty, visceral and energetic action which I'm sure everyone wanted to see. Statham is well supported by Franco, Ryder and Bosworth who all play unlikable yet realistic characters. They are not completely one-dimensional, more like...one and a half dimensions? Franco needs to be an antagonist in more films, he can be rather intimidating. Granted, the script isn't exactly special and does become more absurd as the film comes to its conclusion. The excessive quick cuts also made for disorientating action, however I had a good time. I knew what I wanted, and I got it. Statham satisfaction at its finest.",Homefront
41,pmtelefon,Statham's classic,10,1 February 2021,"I first saw ""Homefront"" in the theater (Regal Westbury, NY). I've seen it a few times since. It's a great movie. Sylvester Stallone's script is excellent. Gary Fleder's direction is tight. The cast is rock solid, with standout work by Jason Statham, James Franco and Winona Ryder. Neither of those three has ever been better. ""Homefront"" gabs you right from the beginning and never let's go. It's one of the best action movies of the 2000s. Honorable mention: the always welcome Clancy Brown.",Homefront
42,Vartiainen,Old school action film,5,2 July 2014,"It is a true pleasure that they're still making action films like this one, where enough room is given to gun fights and people dying in horrible fashion, the violence has weight behind it, the protagonists are unabashedly the meanest badasses in town and the villains are both heinous and charismatic. It doesn't try to ground itself in reality too much, giving us the wish-fulfillment aspect so many modern movies miss.Jason Statham is also a great action star. The man's very presence screams that sweet ""seen it all and come out tougher and meaner"" danger, which means that he can do pretty much anything in a movie such as this one and it will feel believable. But it's also surprising how well the man can act. The scenes of Phil Broker (Statham) interacting with his daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) are genuinely heartfelt and don't take away from the action aspect at all. Maddy is also a fun character. A little girl who has been taught by his police dad to look after herself, which will do without a moment's hesitation.James Franco plays the main villain, Morgan 'Gator' Bodine, a small-time meth lord, who gets pulled in to the conflict when Broker unintentionally pisses off his sister. From there the film is nothing more than one blazing action scene after another and I couldn't have been happier. That's what I paid to see and that's what I got. Though I must say that while Franco is a talented actor, his natural presence is way too refined for him to play a bayou-born drug dealer. Not a huge problem though and Franco pulls off the required feel of danger and craziness more than easily.Homefront is an excellent movie to pick if you're looking for that action superstar era charm and heaviness, or if you're a fan of Statham in general.",Homefront
43,BeneCumb,"Nothing really new, but above-average entertainment",7,27 February 2014,"Single ex-agent with a child, settling down in a new closed place where a self-claimed boss has set his own rules - there are (and definitely will be) lots of similar stories, about past, present and future. As it is difficult to add a new angle or approach, it is usually acting and solution of issues that counts, are they logical, or just ridiculous and unrealistic. Homefront has evidently more pluses than minuses - pleasant performances by ""the good guys"" - Jason Statham as a caring but tough father Phil Broker and Izabela Vidovic as sensitive but tough Maddy, realistic atmosphere, catchy fights, meaningful use of violence... True, ""the bad guys"" are too plain, the ending has predictable structure and elements, and there are scenes not necessary for the general course of events, but absence of dudikoffs-seagals and torpid chases and fights is already a valuable feature. It is nice to see that Statham as an action hero has followed in the footsteps of e.g. Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis.All in all, a good and proper-time (1,5 hours) thriller.

Although Broker does his best to make peace, but the crack head moms drug lord brother(James Franco) is called in to shake things up.A pretty descent film, I like Jason Statham just does not play a one noted action hero, but also plays a concern parent pretty well also.

45,alindsay-al,an above average Statham film,6,12 January 2015,"I am a Jason Statham fan so when this came up on my Netflix cue I decided to watch it and to quickly certain extent I am happy I did. The premise sees a former dea agent move himself and his daughter to a small town but an altercation with a meth dealer and a biker gang puts them in danger. Now it is true that Jason Statham plays the same character in everything but he does it well and he has a good performance in this film. He shows some acting chops and he combines the drama and humour well in this film. The supporting cast is also really good with James Franco playing the villain and he really adds something to this film. He is quite funny for the villain and this performance shows how good an actor he is. The girl who plays stathams daughter does a great job as well and the chemistry between the two is really good and you actually feel like you should care about them. Kate Bosworth and winona Ryder play cracked out women in this film and they both do a convincing job in the role. The story is where the film falls apart, it just becomes massively convoluted and you will not know what peoples motivations are or if you buy them even. Also there is a suspected romance near the beginning of film but it is just forgotten and never spoke of again. The script is okay with some of the dialogue being witty and funny but sometimes it just took itself too serious and forgot that it is a Jason Statham action film. The style is okay with the guy in charge of the sound effects doing a great job as you feel every hit. But for some reason every action scene there is shaky cam and you cannot see it of the hits and that really sucks. Overall this film could be worth a watch if you are a Statham fan.",Homefront
46,estebangonzalez10,Let Statham unleash the beast!,4,25 November 2014,"""Whatever you're thinking, rethink it.""I can't think of a better actor to deliver a line in a menacing, yet calm way, than Jason Statham does here. He is one of the contemporary action stars that audiences will go see without hesitation or worrying about the screenplay. The reason is because there are very few actors that can deliver their fight scenes as well as he does. Audiences can feel every punch or kick from Statham without the need of quick edits or shaky camera movements. Unfortunately, the main problem with Homefront is that director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls, Runaway Jury) didn't use his action skills as a means to improve the movie, but rather sticked to the usual way of filming action scenes which involve quick edits, extreme close-ups, and shaky camera movements. Why would you have Statham star in your film if you don't take advantage of his well choreographed action scenes? The few action scenes in Homefront could have been shot with a steady camera and less cuts which would have made this a much more enjoyable watch because Statham has a great screen presence and he's always fun to watch. It's too bad that they decided to hold Statham's character back and didn't let him explode on screen. Homefront's screenplay was adapted by Sylvester Stallone from Chuck Logan's novel. Sly had intended to use the story for another Rambo sequel, but decided to put it into Statham's hands instead. The premise of the story is very familiar as you have the main character moving to a small town in order to put his violent past behind him (if you think about it, it is what Rambo has always been trying to do, but somehow he's a magnet for violence). Homefront is just another standard action film that follows pretty much every genre convention so it becomes way too familiar to enjoy it as something other than that, but the problem is that Fleder tries to make a more serious film instead of accepting the fact that it is simply a silly and familiar story. By trying to build character and move the story forward, the film loses its steam because it doesn't accomplish neither and ultimately it drags for most of its runtime. The few action scenes aren't entertaining either because of all the hyper editing going on. The film tries to build character and introduce new elements but it doesn't do it well. Take the romance for instance which is introduced, but it never goes anywhere with the subplots it introduces. We know exactly where everything is leading up to so the least you can do is explode Statham's potential instead of underlying his performance. Despite the familiar story and the hyper edited action scenes there are some positive elements to Homefront. First of all the cast is solid. Besides Jason Statham, you have James Franco, Kate Bosworth, Winona Ryder, and Frank Grillo starring together. James Franco plays a very different villain. He is a local meth kingpin who goes by the name of Gator. He might be intimidating in his small local town, but we know he is no match for Jason Statham. There isn't a second in this film where we feel Statham's character is in real danger and all we are waiting for is for him to let his rage loose. The small grudges that the people in this town hold are about to be blown out of proportions and they will soon find out that they are completely out of his league. The second positive thing about this film is Kate Bosworth's performance. She is almost unrecognizable in her role here, but she delivers the best performance of the movie. If your a fan, you will want to check this film out, if not then there isn't anything worth your time in Homefront.",Homefront

Some surprising faces here you wouldn't expect to see in a movie about meth dealers, really giving their all to the roles including James F-bombin Franco as the films villain, -he is excellent, Winona Ryder as a biker chick, also great and a scary skinny Kate Bosworth as a tweaked out mother who puts this whole story in motion. She is a piece of work in this, instantly hateable.The screenplay was written by Sylvester Stallone (based on a book) and was apparently going to be a vehicle for the Rambo franchise, which makes so much sense once you start watching this. Story goes that Stallone got too old for the role and passed it over to Statham.He plays a former DEA agent who takes his daughter Kit to the quiet town where his (now deceased) wife grew up to start over again after his latest (undercover) drug bust goes very wrong. He soon gets on the wrong side of the local meth drug-lord who in turn sells out his identity to a biker gang. Everyone comes after him, so that we get a couple of big action showdowns one with Frank Grillo and the other with F'n James Franco (His character swears a ton in this) This movie was definitely entertaining, thrilling at times but honestly nothing all that special or remarkable in that respect or in terms of story either.

Winona Ryder really did a great job as the skanky bad girl Sheryl, she and James Franco had a really good chemistry and kinda bad guy dynamic going throughout the film. As for Jason Statham, he was perfect for his starring role, I mean could NOT have picked a better action star to lead this movie! He is sexy, rugged, tough as friggin nails, and overall a real badass, but a badass with a good big heart. Him and his daughter really had great father/daughter chemistry here, you could tell that they really had a great relationship and loved and cared about one another, which was needed for a movie like this one. Kate Bosworth is pretty darn good as well, she is almost unrecognizable here, Redneck trailer trash, anyways, she plays a well written character well here. Now as for the movie itself as a whole, it's kinda average action movie fare, nothing to distinguish it from the rest in this genre. The action and shooting sequences are pretty run of the mill, nothing all too special to see unfortunately. The plot has some nice attachments to it, like the father daughter relationship/connection that I mentioned before. Homefront tries it's hardest to be this edgy awesome new action film, but it did not accomplish that goal. It's just too average to be called awesome or even all that edgy. I mean yah there is time of crude language because of the degenerate characters, and yes, it has some rough violence to some scenes, but that still doesn't make it all that edgy.

54,3xHCCH,It's Awesome Having Jason Stratham as a Dad,5,19 February 2014,"""Homefront"" is another Jason Stratham action flick. With that statement alone, you already know what you will get. Mr. Stratham does not give his fans any less. He is really THE old-fashioned action star of this day. He does not rely too much on computer-generated special effects to entertain his fans. He is all-brawn, the real stuff.However, unlike past Jason Stratham films, ""Homefront"" has other big name stars on the marquee. We see names like James Franco, Kate Bosworth and even Winona Ryder! That is invitation enough to catch this film, and see what else it has to offer. It was also interesting to learn that the script was once written by Sylvester Stallone for himself, but plans miscarried when Sly became too old for the lead.""Homefront"" is set in some small hick town in Louisiana. Phil Broker is a retired drug enforcement agent, who is a single dad to his spunky daughter Maddy. When Maddy gets entangled with a bully in school, they encounter the bully's combative mother Cassie. When Cassie's husband was humiliated by Phil, Cassie asks help from her brother, the drug lord Gator Bodine. That should have been how it goes on paper. But honestly when you watch this film, there is really no doubt that Phil Broker is a class of his own when pitted against these redneck lowlifes in this town. Gator Bodine never really posed a serious threat to Phil at all. Phil was on top of the situation the whole time. The rather anemic final confrontation gave proof to that. James Franco was not able to disappear into this role of Gator. It was as if he was just phoning in his performance, very unconvincing. It felt lazy and routine, unlike his other performances. This shallow performance in ""Homefront"" was not even a shade like his startlingly sinister gang leader performance in ""Spring Breakers"".Kate Bosworth I totally did not recognize. She is totally deglamorized as this foul-mouthed virago of a housewife Cassie, whose unreasonably hot temper started this whole story rolling. Talking about deglamorized, we do not see an iota of Winona Ryder, the 90s it-girl, at all in her role as Sheryl, Gator's rough and unrefined girlfriend. Truth be told, I was confused as to who is who between these two ladies at one point. They practically looked similar with their ""uglifying"" make-up.Of the whole cast, I liked the performance of Izabela Vidovic best. She played the child actress who played Phil's daughter Maddy. Her acting was very natural, especially in the dramatic father-daughter scenes. ""Homefront"" does not disappoint as an all-action Jason Stratham starrer. This one is okay, but rather unsatisfying when compared to ""Transporter"" and other Stratham films. Stratham's character Phil did not look like he had a hard time in this film. He always knew exactly what to do, and was able to execute his plans as he wants. If you watch this for the gritty and realistic action scenes, this film definitely delivers the goods.",Homefront
55,TdSmth5,Slightly above average,7,17 April 2015,"In the intro a father/son motorcycle gang drug business gets raided by police. The gang was infiltrated by Statham who's law enforcement. The son escapes and Statham chases him. When they catch him he forces the police to shoot him. The dad who trusted Statham personally blames him for the death.Years later Statham and his daughter are trying to mind their business in Louisiana under a new identity. One day at school she's bullied by a fat kid. But of course she punches him and knocks him out. She's called to the principal's office and some therapists is also there. Statham has to show up and explain things. But on their way out they run into the redneck parents of the kid who are looking for trouble, so Statham has to kick butt.Even though Statham apologizes, the fat kid's mom, played by the malnourished Bosworth, wants revenge. Her husband is dumb and peaceful so she enlists her drug-cooking brother Gator. He breaks into Statham's house, steals some files, a teddy bear and the cat. Now he knows his true identity and his past. Through a girl of his, he leaks the info to drug-dealing dad from the intro who's in jail and eager for revenge and who still controls a gang which now goes after Statham. They will eventually grab the girl and Statham will have to confront them all.There's actually a book written about this, one of Hollywood's favorite themes, the evil rednecks? And Sly of all people wrote a screenplay on the basis of it? Odd. In any case, if you've seen any anti-redneck movie, you've seen them all. This one has Statham who's trying to sound less British but is always likable. It's actually filmed in beautiful Louisiana. The lovely and talented Izabela Vidovic is a revelation here. Rachelle Lefevre is also cute. Of course you do care about the good guys and despise the bad guys and want to see the outcome of the movie even though there are no surprises. Homefront is another welcome entry in the R-rated action movie genre.

56,peterp-450-298716,You get what you expected,7,11 March 2014,"Whatever you're thinking...rethink it.After the movies ""Safe"" and ""Parker"", which weren't that great, and ""Hummingbird"", which I thought wasn't that bad but a little different from the standard roles Statham plays normally, he reappears in this straightforward hardcore action. The screenplay was written by Stallone and so it gets a bit of the atmosphere of the action movies from the 80s. The movie appears to be based on a novel by Chuck Logan, Vietnam veteran and author of several crime novels featuring Phil Broker, ex-cop and ex-military, as the main character.I've really enjoyed this movie. Especially the action scenes (unfortunately there are only a few of those) are perfectly suited for an actor like Statham. Fearless, blazing-fast and crashing hard. That is why most people watch a movie with Statham. And they won't be disappointed. Looking at the beginning of the film I expected the worst. The cliché of a motorcycle gang driving into a city on their way to check a drug lab. Statham is an undercover with long greasy hair. What follows is the DEA flooding the place and attempting to arrest the gang. The exploding drug lab looked like it came out of a TV series from the 80s such as ""The A-Team"". A spectacle that resembles a typical firework on the 4th of July.Due to the trigger-happy policemen who came rushing in, the son of the drug lord is killed with a ridiculous amount of bullets. I suppose they were making sure he won't survive it. Fortunately, the further course of this film is of a slightly higher level than the weak intro. Beautiful snapshots from South America with images of the bayou like we have seen in ""Mud"". What bothers me is the way the local people there are portrayed. They seem to be stereotypical ""rednecks"" who would welcome a stranger in a contemptuously manner and are more likely to give him a beating as a welcome present. Statham decides to settle there with his 10 year old daughter. An excellent performance of this teenager and probably someone we are going to hear of in the future.The only downside of this movie is that it's as simple and predictable as a Sesame Street story. You can expect a ""one against all"" story, out of which the tormented and threatened father will come as the great triumphator. There were a few ridiculous situations. How is it possible that even though Broker deflected so far away, he ends up in a miserable little town where the local emerging drug baron happens to have a girlfriend who is pretty familiar with the motorcycle gang mentioned earlier. And I don't think it's a normal procedure that an ex-cop has an archive with files of criminals lying in his dank basement at home. And certainly not a file from the one who's after him to take revenge.But all this can't spoil the fun with this popcorn movie. Statham is ice cold and deadly dangerous. Vidovic convincingly plays the role as a daughter. That she was going to knock down that fat bully, was no surprise. Franco tries to act as a tough guy, but he always gives me the impression he'll spontaneously burst out into tears. Kate Bosworth is worth a mention as the addicted mother of that little brat and has an incredible big mouth. Winona Ryder was almost unrecognizable as the drug whore, but non-important. And Clancy Brown plays a great role as sheriff of the godforsaken town. Brown better known as Captain Hadley in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is cut out for a role as a sheriff who is corrupt.Conclusion: A predictable storyline with some entertaining fight scenes.

Widower Phil Broker decides to leave the DEA Service and retire away from that violence to a quiet country town with 9-yr old daughter Maddie (Izabella Vidovic). In school, Maddie beats up a bully and the parents are all upset and want an apology after Broker takes down Jimmy Clum (Marcus Hester) the father of the bully. But wait: the jailed Biker leader sends his biker men to avenge his son's death. This can't be good. We can see that Broker has a lot on his plate, but we know he can handle everything, but a new wrinkle is his daughter Maddie and she must be kept safe. This is a typical Jason Statham movie and we know he will prevail, but what makes this more compelling is the daughter as we watch and care because of Maddie. We may be seeing a newer side to Jason Statham's movies in that this is the second time he has worked with a child as in the movie SAFE, which was very good btw. There is very good chemistry between Statham and Izabella Vidovic and she also performs well. The supporting cast of James Franco, Kate Bosworth, and Winona Ryder make this a must-see movie as I think some, if not all, of them were going for Oscar nominations later on. They were very good. Guess who helped write the screenplay for HOMEFRONT? Sylvester Stallone. And, of course, the dialogues were spot on.

59,quincytheodore,"Story so archaic, it wastes the talented cast.",3,3 December 2013,"I suppose it's not surprising that Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay, since the plot is so ancient it might have been etches as hieroglyph on Rambo's machine gun. There's an appeal to simple action movie, but it's nowhere to be found on the uninspiring Homefront, and even the capable cast can't save it from mediocrity. Either it's from the poor casting or lackluster predictable content, audience will most likely have little to none enjoyment watching Jason Statham bludgeoning random thugs, again.Jason Statham plays Phil Broker, a former undercover cop who retires into the countryside after his testimony incarcerated a drug lord. Little did he know that his past, and untidy file saving, will haunt him and his daughter. The concept is to portray the antagonist as a man involuntarily dragged into fights as he defends a frail looking little girl. Statham has done this concept in last year movie Safe, and to approximately the same undistinguished effect. The movie doesn't offer anything novel; in fact Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando back in '80s has more flair and arguably more personality.There are several big names here, but they are underutilized or badly cast. James Franco brings plenty credibility, and originally I thought he'd offer more challenge in acting department for Statham, however his role as Gator just doesn't work. He doesn't convey the menacing threat to Statham, and if the movie opted for more cerebral contest, it could've been better, but instead his actions just seem random and unorganized. It is far from clever scheme the backwater hoodlum runs, it more resembles panicked redneck rampage with money as incentive.Winona Ryder is looking messy and not in intentionally thought provoking or sympathetic way. Honestly, I didn't even recognize her at first, she's too hectic to give more impression than just Gator's confused lackey. Kate Bosworth goes full hillbilly crackhead, profanity firing in all cylinders. Another thing that's wrong with the movie; it spews curses constantly. There are many ways to make profanity works, peppering it as ham-fisted way to lure any reaction from audience is not one of them.Screenplay builds up inconsistently as it gives the illusion that something dramatic might happen soon, although it unfortunately turns into average brawl yet again. Music and sound effect try too hard to sell the dynamic, in which there's barely any, they function more as loud distractions if any. Perhaps the nicest thing in the movie is how the action is done. These scenes are pretty well done; they have rough impact and believably pain-inducing, although there is only modest amount of it.Homefront doesn't bring anything new. The cast is talented and action is passable, but for extremely abysmal plot which audience can find at cheap bargain or rerun at Cinemax, it's hardly worth anyone's time.",Homefront

62,cricket30,It's another foreign invasion . . .,8,1 December 2013,". . . as Londoner Jason Statham follows in those Dern Yankees' footsteps to disable or kill about half the male population of Rayville, Louisiana. In this fantasy screenplay from the mind of Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), Statham's character--Phil Broker--cuts through the flower of the Confederacy like a knife through butter. Making this especially appalling to we denizens of Dixieland is that ""Phil"" is dumber than a post. After Narcing out a Stars & Bars biker gang in a major drug bust (though he stuck out in this ""undercover"" assignment like a tulip in an onion patch), what does he do? Worm his way deeper into Everyone's-a-Cousin-Land UNDER HIS REAL NAME, with his nine-year-old daughter in tow, who happens to be a Kung Fu prodigy on the school playground. Not content to be an accident waiting to happen, Phil affixes a lightning rod to his family by keeping 15 file boxes with contact information for all of his criminal enemies (as well as his old narc ID photos, complete with past aliases) in the cellar of his UNLOCKED home! To add insult to injury, he beats up all the Good Ol' Boys in front of their kids, and cockily brings just his fists and feet to gun and knife fights. How could anyone live in a Red State, and NOT hate Hollywood? This is such a textbook example, I'm rating it ""8"" so more of my kind will see it and get inoculated against La-La Land.",Homefront

If there was one single thing in this movie that I haven't seen in 100 other films, I must have missed it while yawning. Do yourself a favor and fast-forward to the last ten minutes, or better yet, just go out for ice cream instead of watching this mess.Sylvester Stallone adapted this from a novel by Chuck Logan. Read the book, skip the movie.How they can stuff so much manure into a single film and then stretch it out to 1h40m is some kind of magic act. The movie should have been exactly as long as the trailer as everything you need to know was contained in that one minute and five seconds.And there is a kid with a major role, as if the movie wasn't lousy enough for you.",Homefront

The action scenes are few, brief, and scattered, and the ""sensitive"" scenes with his daughter are labored and painful. Statham shows more concern for his cat than his daughter. ""Hey, Jason. Not everyone can be a well-rounded actor. Take some kudos from your roles as an action hero and spare us the sensitive roles."" Of course Statham is not the only one to blame here. The screenplay from Stallone is by-the-numbers and has so many cliché scenes it's embarrassing to watch. Stallone has written some excellent films (""Rocky"", ""First Blood"") but he also has some real duds (""Cobra"", ""Rhinestone"") and this is clearly one of those duds.If you want a film where Statham shows a sensitive side, I thought ""The Bank Job"" was one of his best. But that was long ago and most of his work before and after has been one-dimensional and that's OK.Along with the sad script and Statham's inability to project emotion, most of the actors phone in their performances. Winona Ryder is completely wasted and James Franco puts in one of his lesser performances. Rachelle LeFevre (""Under the Dome"", ""Twilight"") was the only bright spot.Give this one a miss. It's OK for a rainy night on TV.",Homefront
66,phubbs,Homefront,6,21 March 2014,"Jason Statham, fighting, guns, errr...more fighting, yet not so much profanity. Predictable action packed romp you say? oh no don't be silly you silly film-goer you, oh wait.So Statham is the new guy in a small redneck town who is just trying to live a quiet life after his rambunctious time as a DEA undercover agent. After his little girl beats up some fat kid Statham finds himself in trouble with the fat kids hick parents, doesn't help that he floors the kids dad. So the fat kids trailer trash mum goes to see her brother who just happens to be the local drug dealer bad guy which as you can guess equals action time for Statham and his big hairy muscles. Believe it or not this is actually based on a novel amazingly.Yep this is most definitely your bog standard action thriller that could of easily starred anyone of the classic big name action heroes. Same could be said for the bad guy role, anyone could of played it, it makes no difference. The story plods along at the usual clichéd rate with the usual things you know are bound to happen. Lots of face to face confrontations where Statham shows the locals who's boss, sneaky breaking and entering from the bad guys, intimidation and dirty low down tricks to unnerve our hero and eventually a big shoot out and kidnapping of Statham's little girl. Despite the outrageously corny plot and corny hard man act by Statham I must admit to enjoying the film and its vicious fights. When Jay is approached by these big lunkheads you know the outcome from the start, but you gotta admire the choreography involved bringing these rucks to life. The sound effects are blisteringly realistic as Statham chins these guys whilst smashing them against hard objects. I gotta say I liked it and found myself inadvertently cheering Jay on.The bad guys are weak though, the bikers are pretty gritty and the local hick muscle is nicely intimidating but Franco as the main bad guy is weak. He doesn't actually do anything for the entire film accept scowl and look unwashed. He never fights Statham! all he does is pinch the little girls kitten (yet doesn't harm it) and then pinch the little girl (yet doesn't harm her). He mainly watches from the sidelines keeping out of the way, which is odd, he's not even remotely intimidating. The other weird thing is he actually shows signs of concern for what he's doing, as if he doesn't really wanna go down this route but is forced too. Its like he's not really that bad a guy, he just wants to deal his drugs in peace. So despite being a total JCVD-type vehicle I found this film entertaining in a typically ruthless tooth loosening kinda way. We've seen it all before of course, Statham isn't really the perfect likable hero lets be honest, he growls too much and isn't pretty. Franco is rather limp here and Ryder's character seems pointless but the violence is top notch and the film has a good steamy atmosphere. What I still find amusing is everything that happens in this film is all because of the little girl slapping that fat kid in the face at school. That's some chain of events right there!.6/10",Homefront
67,spookyrat1,The Home Fires Are Burning!,7,13 July 2019,"This is quite an interesting Jason Statham auctioneer for a couple of reasons. One is that the screenplay is/was written by Sylvester Stallone and which then sat on a shelf for many a year, not being acted upon. The second, is that like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham shows that he isn't the slightest bit adverse against working with children. 2012's Safe was followed up with this offering, where Statham plays retired DEA Agent Phil Broker who has moved with his daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) to the small Louisiana town in which his deceased wife grew up. Both movies feature young girls in prominent roles whose characters are closely intertwined with that of Statham's.Homefront is also similar to Hummingbird (made around the same time) in that the storylines are just that little touch deeper and more complex than your typical Statham action vehicle, which in my opinion makes both movies, that much more interesting. A couple of small twists in this movie for instance, see what are first violently implacable opponents of Broker, later become allies (of sorts). It's a pity there wasn't a little more made of Broker's seemingly developing relationship with Maddy's school teacher, which does spark our initial interest, but then the thread just seems to be discarded during the second half of the film.Homefront is directed by the experienced Gary Fleder and has a thoroughly deep cast including James Franco, Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth (scaringly good!), Clancy Brown and the under-used (as mentioned above) Rachelle Lefevre. The Louisiana settings are different, the action sequences are pretty much par for the course and I'm glad the soft toy and the cat were found. However the less mentioned about Jason's prologue amazingly inappropriate wig, the better we'll all be for the experience.",Homefront

If you're looking for a ridiculous action movie this holiday weekend, here it is.",3,22 August 2015,"'Homefront' is a strange movie to release at Thanksgiving. This violent and bloody action thriller stars Jason Statham and James Franco, with a small appearance by Winona Ryder. Based on a novel by Chuck Logan, the cheesy script was originally written by Sylvester Stallone, who doesn't seem to have grown out of the '80s action films he starred in. While Stallone is nowhere to be seen in the movie, he serves as producer and his hand-prints are all over it.In fact, this was written by Stallone a long time ago, originally as a finale for his Rambo character. The plot and story are very similar to almost every other action movie involving a single parent and a kid who get involved with bad guys. Never at any point do you think that Statham's character is in any real danger. He easily overcomes the villains, no matter how many team up on him.In a high-octane opening scene, DEA agent Phil Broker (Statham in long greasy hair) takes out a biker gang's meth lab. A car and motorcycle chase with the top drug lord ensues, and the point of the story is set in motion – Broker and his family are targeted for death.Cut to a couple of years later. Phil and his 10-year-old daughter Maddy are coping with the sudden loss of the girl's mother due to cancer, and they think that moving to a quiet town in rural Louisiana is just what they need. Since good ol' dad, who still speaks with a British accent for some reason, doesn't do cupcakes or princesses, he's taught his daughter to defend herself. When a fat bully attacks her at school, she leaves him on the schoolyard with bloody face. It turns out that the bully's parents are heavy drug users. After Phil defends himself against the druggie parents, the mom (Kate Bosworth) enlists the help of her brother, Gator Bodine (James Franco), the biggest and baddest meth dealer in the South.Franco has had an interesting year, from playing Oz to Alien to Hugh Hefner, and even himself on film. Here, he gets to have fun as a redneck asshole of epic proportions.Gator and his girlfriend (Ryder) recruit his henchman and some of the biker gang from earlier to seek revenge. What follows is a string of curse words, fight scenes and lousy dialogue. All the while, the child-in-distress scenario is hammed up and played out. I hoped that director Gary Fleder might allow Statham to use his martial arts skills to the fullest, but his camera-work is quick, choppy and uninteresting, and the action sequences are all sub-par.That being said, the movie is sort of fun, even if it's stupid fun.

There are some far-fetched procedural things that really don't work, but past that, this is a pretty solid, straight-forward action flick.James Franco works as the villain here - even though the film doesn't really develop as smoothly as it should. Some of the other players in this are there merely as punching bags, and while the dialog is fine, the film rushes a bit and lacks some intimate hero vs. villain moments. THere's really only one of those moments, but it lacks the grit and intimacy I would have liked to have seen between these two actors. Perhaps it's because that meeting happens in a public place, but more likely it's just an oversight in what amounts to an all-too-tidy film.WHere the film excels is in the action sequences. If you're a revenge-factor, or just knock-em-sock-em lover, you'll like this movie. THe fight scenes are well-choreographed and realistic. The first sequence is a bit sloppy, but the rest are spot-on.All in all this is a straight-forward action flick. A Throwback from the 1980's. And that's not necessarily a bad thing at all. Aside from some unrealistic situations involving confidential information - ""Homefront"" is a pleasant return home for Sly, Stathom, and action movie fans.You'll like this if you liked:Commando(about even), Shooter(about even), Stone Cold(not as good), or THe Punisher(Jane/about even).Sidenotes: Whoever made the trailer deserves the most props - it was excellent - the main reason why I rented this from the redbox.

72,Movie-Misfit,"Typical Statham, But It Never Tires!",7,3 December 2014,"Most Jason Statham movies run pretty much in the same direction. Heavy on action, mild on comedy, and light on story!But as one of Hollywood's greatest action stars, you can get pigeon- holed in a run of projects that become all the same.Homefront comes from the pen of Hollywood legend Sly Stallone. I've long been a fan of Stallone both in front of and behind the camera, and feel he has always been very underrated for what he really can do.Staying out of sight in this project, Stallone offers us a feast of small town characters who only know Statham as the mysterious new man in town. Jason has moved here along with his daughter, who is a great wee actress, after a strenuous life of which we are introduced to at the start of the film...It isn't long before his old life catches up with him, all caused by the smallest little concern which I actually found to be one of the most honest reasons used in a film, that brought reality forward. As a parent, this for me was very understandable and very clever in the most simplistic way.I don't want to give too much away, but Homefront is a pretty sweet film. With a hint of 80's just playing on it, Jason plays his role with the usual smart ass charm and gets to let loose in the action front more than once. James Franco, of who I am not a huge fan off, plays a sleazy anti-hero who comes across as someone we dislike, yet just wants to please his messed up family.Stallone has given us a great action drama, with many dark moments, action scenes, and morals that makes for some fine entertainment.Definitely worth the watch!",Homefront

There's no CGI special effects just shoot em up, classic fight scenes that rely on brawn and not brain (certainly not an issue on this occasion).The cast is also really good. Jason Statham does what he does best, James Franco plays a very convincing unstable drug lord and Kate Bosworth steals the show as a multi- dimensional druggie mother.

Not usually a big fan of James Franco﻿, but he is good in this he seems to have been kept busy enough, and calm enough to not seem anything like the junkies his character is creating, and enabling. The women were the real power players in this movie if not in physical strength, but the acting, and how far they ""seem"" to have taken the rolls by looking so much like emaciated Meth types. Winona Ryder﻿ was one thing to see (she looks younger, and at the same time less healthy than ever) but Kate Bosworth﻿ has gone to the limit with the look, and you can not help but be struck at her appearance.

I loved ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo""!The film borrows heavily from the likes of ""Taken"" and ""Sons of Anarchy"" which were both immensely popular around the time this was made. At times, scenes here were all just too unbelievable and lacked authenticity which kept drawing me out of the movie. The last 20 minutes in particular kept making me laugh.. during scenes which weren't meant to be funny.James Franco was very convincing as a redneck. In a way, I feel like he was born to play that role.

Then that might be considered special.Overall, ""Homefront"" feels like a Direct-to-DVD film but with some bigger stars in it. The story is pretty weak and the film's center conflict is set into motion by events that feel ridiculously unnecessary and way too over-the-top to take seriously. Add in the fact that there are elements to the story that are established and never used again and you have a movie that really felt like it had no idea what it was doing. It's clear that the story wants to make sure that meth dealer James Franco wants to see former DEA agent Jason Statham pay in a big, very die-able, way but the route they take to get this conflict to rise is more hilarious and completely ridiculous than grounds for a decent action film that may not be memorable but it will satisfy the action fix.Finally, while Clancy Brown is doing his usual job of being a great actor even if the project is forgettable, the rest of the cast doesn't seem to share his work ethic. Even though I enjoy James Franco in most stuff and Jason Statham in some stuff, both men look like they are giving ""the check cleared"" amount of effort for their roles. Meanwhile, Winona Ryder—who is a character that really didn't have that much place in the story—is acting like this film is going to win her an Oscar. So, in the acting department, the film is all over the place.I wasn't expecting much from ""Homefront"" beyond the possibility for some decent action—and there were some good fight scenes. However, the film feels like it isn't bothering with the effort needed to make this even an average film and, in turn, makes the film very forgettable and something I could have waited to see when it inevitably ends up airing on FX or AMC during the daylight hours.Greetings, buddy!

Then, during a heated argument, Broker beats up the bully's dad... At this point all heck (not exactly hell) breaks loose in the gossipy town, where redneck hoods begin questioning his identity, leading to a collection of rushed shaky-cam bouts before meeting our lead antagonist... Although James Franco's Morgan 'Gator' Bodine is more of a ratty middleman than formidable menace: a meth-dealing, instigative lowlife passing secret info to Broker's hidden enemies Sadly, Franco's performance not only seems phoned in, he doesn't have much to do or say...The best scenes involve Statham fighting the more physically-inclined heavies Anything beats the corny conversations between Broker and his daughter, who Stallone writes as more of a deep-thinking adult than vulnerable child Yet she's the one to ultimately protect as underdeveloped side-characters, including Wionna Ryder as Gator's druggie girlfriend and Clancy Brown as the local sheriff, square off in a thundering car chase resulting in a predicable conclusion...Then again, for a Jason Statham movie written by his EXPENDABLES mentor, a simplistic testosterone-driven plot can be both expected and forgiven The real shame is that our tough-as-nails hero didn't have more of a challenge throughout.",Homefront

Yes, you read the right.For all intents and purposes, Homefront should be a train wreck of an abomination in film-making. But if you squash your preconceived biases that will doom Homefront to failure, you open yourself to watch a supremely entertaining, funny and highly thrilling film.Phil Broker recently widowed and struggling to raise his 9-year old daughter Maddy the only way a father knows. Broker also happens to be a well trained DEA agent who chooses to leave the dangerous action and retire to a small town in Louisiana to care for his daughter. With small town life comes small town trouble, and Broker is quickly thrust into the drama despite his fervent effort to remain impartial and uninvolved. Unfortunately, his past history and the criminal occurrences of his new residence makes matters more complicated and he must soon use his skills to protect his daughter the only way he knows how.Homefront has an energy and vibrancy about it, a spark, that revitalizes the potentially stagnant action film type. It does not deviate from the formula too much to make it feel forced and contrived, but it has a well formed and original enough plot thanks to the source material from Chuck Logan's original and synonymously titled novel. Sylvester Stallone, the film's screenwriter and executive producer, who never makes a token egotistical cameo, translates Logan's narrative into an un-caricaturized action-crime-drama, a pride worthy feat. The difference between Homefront and its inferior counterparts is Homefront focuses on the story and the characters and the creative direction of Gary Fleder never veers into nonsensical excess.Jason Statham is quintessential Statham as Phil Broker, bringing his stoic charisma and martial arts ability to be used perfectly in this film as the steadfast protagonist. No protagonist is complete without an equally matched antagonist, of which Homefront has several players, all of which fully formed and complete characters. Kate Bosworth, James Franco and Winona Ryder are all notable in their acting and contributing to the film's overall success.At first glance, Homefront should be an uninspired derivative action flick solely for box office numbers. But, it is not. It is a surprise of a film and a shame that some potential viewers may choose to overlook this film due to their misinformed prejudices for the actors, crew and subject matter.

Didn't Bonnie Tyler sing something about that?
In a world where today's action heroes are a bit limp it's nice to see that at least Jason Statham can compare to the action heroes of the 80's
This is probably why Sylvester Stallone chose Statham to be his right hand man in The Expendables.Speaking of Mr Stallone this movie is a product from his very own pen.
Homefront is based on the novel by Chuck Logan and adapted for screen by Rocky himself.
Originally a vehicle for Sly, I believe the choice of putting Statham in the lead role was a very wise one indeed.
Don't get me wrong Stallone would have done a good job but Statham seems more believable in this role.Home front focus's on a retired DEA agent who resides in a small backwater town.
When he and his child fall foul of the local Rednecks Phil Broker (Statham) must fight for their safety.Homefront is a simple movie.
One that harks back to the action flicks of the 70's and 80's.
With a impressive cast including James Franco. Winona Ryder, Kate Bosworth and Clancy Brown, this film should be sure to please.
In most parts it does. Take aside the finale which does venture into the town of OTT, this is a decent action drama.
I say drama. Jason Statham gets to flex his acting muscles a little more than usual but I don't think he'll be troubling Daniel Day Lewis any time soon.The biggest problem with Homefront is that Director Gary Fleder doesn't allow Statham to do what he's best at.
Kick ass convincingly!
Once again we are treated to Shaky cam syndrome. There really is no need.
Jason Statham is one of the best action/ martial arts stars working today.
Why not step the camera back a bit and let the audience see what's going on.
This is a common gripe of mine with action movies of today. It's ok if you have a star that isn't very good in the ass kickery department but Statham is a living legend. James Franco excels in a rare villainous role as does Kate Boswell as his junkie sister.
I'm sure she must have lost weight for the role as she's painfully thin here.
With the likes of Winona Ryder and Frank Grillo under utilised it's up to good old Statham to carry the show.
Homefront is a worthy way to spend 1hr 40mins but with such a short runtime certain characters and sub-plots don't get fleshed out.
The romance between Broker and school teacher Susan never has time to blossom.
I kind of get the feeling that much of the character development was left on the cutting room floor.
Sad really as this could have allowed Homefront to be much more than just another throw away action flick.",Homefront

It kind of succeeds, but not quite. I really wished it would though, because it's an important subject.The movie takes place in a cozy little American town, and I really liked the scenery.

Made for TV war on drugs propaganda enhanced for theater by adding a few big name actors who apparently are in need of some spending cash or anxious to finish a studio contract commitment.Pretty much the empty action you'd expect from a Stallone written script. If there's a cliché, cut up, choppy action scene to be used and a bad song to add to the soundtrack, you'll find it all in this film.The film starts out with some interesting child interaction. To keep things at least mildly interesting, Bosworth and Ryder put in entertaining performances as more than eye candy. It's too bad the story is such nonsense as a whole.You can get ridiculous shooting scenes and drugs with at least some humor in 21 Jump Street, which isn't great, but at least it doesn't take itself seriously.",Homefront

91,jb_campo,Standard Statham Flick,6,17 August 2014,"Not much of a story here. There are plenty of action flicks out there with better story lines. But if you like Statham, you'll do OK with Homefront. Statham as an ex-DEA agent decides to retire to a po dunk town in Louisiana for some reason. The whole premise is silly, but whatever. He's a single father raising his 10 year old daughter. Then he gets into it with the red neck locals, who also happen to be drug dealers, or vicious bikers, or other loser types.The main villain, played poorly by James Franco, as Gator Bodine, fails to shock or scare you. He's basically a coward, sneaking about, never wanting to be involved with any of the crap he orders. Winona Ryder plays this drug moll type who somehow if involved with Franco, and the bikers. He doesn't make sense, but whatever, we just want to see Statham beat up the bad guys.The 10 year old girl acts pretty well, as does Ryder, and also Kate Bosworth does OK as this red neck lady who kind of sees the light as to her ignorance. The plot is all over the place. You'll see chases that fail to excite, and the ending, yeah, whatever, fails to excite. That's about it. So-so acting, not a deep plot, nothing special for cinematography, some stuff gets blown up, and Statham beats up some people. If that suffices for you, and you like Statham, go for it. Otherwise, not much here. Enjoy",Homefront
92,trublu215,The cast saves what would otherwise be a direct-to-DVD film,6,10 July 2014,"Homefront is Jason Statham's latest addition to his already impressive action filmography and while it does have its moments, this is an otherwise mediocre film. Yes, I already know, these types of movies are fun, cool and require very little thought. However, is getting a coherent and logical plot too much to ask? Homefront plays out the familial rivalries to the extreme with one thing leading to another then another and before you know it a biker gang and meth heads get involved. I wasn't looking for the next Citizen Kane but some realism could have benefited the film's gritty look and brutal violence. Despite not having a shred of common sense, Homefront is entertaining and will most likely do the trick for a boring Sunday afternoon. Jason Statham plays his normal tough guy to a T and it is glorious. Here is a guy that never sells himself short, he knows what he is and how to be one of the last great action stars in cinema. James Franco plays an interesting bad guy, a guy who is nowhere near the most evil character in the film yet he still is the main villain. As far as balancing purposes, I felt more connected to every single other villain except Franco. Plus, the fake southern accent was almost as bad as Tom Cruise's Irish accent. Frank Grillo makes a small but memorable appearance as one evil bastard in this, definitely stealing the show from Franco. Winona Ryder and Kate Bosworth turn in very good performances as meth addicted white trash but never really leave you with anything to look back on. They're most definitely throwaway performances. The screenplay by Sly Stallone is bare bones, there's a lot of want for subtext but in a film like this, you'll be lucky to get a sub-plot let alone anything substantial upon a second viewing. Overall, Homefront is pure action packed fun. The bad guys fall by the dozens and the good guy takes all of three punches in this hyper-stylized action thriller that will surely cure boredom for its 100 minute runtime but by the end of it, you'll be wishing for something a bit more.",Homefront
93,doorsscorpywag,Pretty poor truth be told,2,5 February 2014,"Jason Statham is a decent actor. He will never trouble Shakespeare true but he has carved out a nice niche for himself and proved he could act in films like Snatch, Lock Stock and the Bank Job. Sadly he is wasted here along with the rest of what is a talented cast.The opening sequence is unbelievably silly and the film goes down hill from there.For no sensible reason he packs in his job as a DEA agent and moves to Redneckville where the hillbillies cook Meth and talk in an accent that would confuse a Scotsman. James Franco as the ridiculously named 'Gator' is less menacing than the little kitten he catnaps and Kate Bosworth, his sister in the film, does nothing but swear and scream hysterically.Winona Ryder who is an excellent little actress is criminally under-used here. We hear she is genius but her character does little to endorse that fact. It could have been a great part for her but instead it's pretty dull and ordinary.Which best describes the film really. Nothing much of interest really happens. Jason hits a few people and seems to talk in some kind of Cockney American accent which probably confused the Rednecks who were speaking an even more incomprehensible dialect. The final shoot out is dull and derivative and seems nothing more than a way to fill in an hour and a half.Sly wrote this as a follow on from First Blood by all accounts. Maybe it would have been done better as that.Innocuous enough stuff really but there are several billion better ways to pass 90 minutes.",Homefront

99,monkeysgalore,Essentially a Much Darker and More Violent Burt Reynolds Movie; One of Statham's Best,8,11 April 2020,"Another Jason Statham vehicle, Homefront is one of his better performances and films. Boasting lots riveting action scenes and a great, if unlikely, villain in the form of James Franco of all people.Jason Statham is his usual gruff, grizzled, charismatic self. He is the heart of the movie, though he is helped by a weirdly good performance from the girl who plays his daughter, who ends up being not only not annoying, but actually helpful and an at least mildly engaging character. James Franco, known for his envelope-pushing comedy films and Spider-Man 3 (2007) gives a lot of energy to his villainous performance, and makes for a really interesting antagonist to Statham.The premise, based on a book and originally written by Sylvester Stallone for a Rambo installment, works very well and feels sort of like a Burt Reynolds movie. It feels like an updated version of Malone (1987).The action is phenomenal and very entertaining. The opening shootout/chase, gas station fight, boat house fight, house shootout, forest fight, and final fight were all excellent. While the film has a bit of a slower pace, the action scenes are explosive, bloody, and visceral, and Statham really flexes his martial arts muscles with some great fight scenes, including an excellent throw-down with Frank Grillo and one of the most satisfying beatings ever in which Statham goes to town on Franco. Also, the opening is legit, no matter how generic it is.A worthy entry in Statham's list of excellent action thrillers, Homefront is a gritty action movie that won't disappoint. I loved it, and I actually love most of Statham's films. I think his movies get a lot of undeserved hate. Check this one out for sure.",Homefront

But soon enough I forgot my own thoughts because I didn't really have the time to think anymore: I had to follow the plot even if I already knew where it was going. Action caught me and brought me away with her. And I think she could do the same to you.At least if you are a male. These are the hormones, I guessThe movie is nice, rhythm is so good, without any unneeded pause or situations appositely made up just to heighten the heat. James Franco is so good in playing a badass (his own kind of a badass) that you easily empathize with him more than with the hero.

Jason plays Phil Broker who used to be an undercover DEA agent, he moves away with his young daughter but soon his past comes back to haunt him. He and his daughter have a run in with a family which then leads to other dangerous people getting involved. The film has some excellent action scenes where Jason Statham literally just beats the hell out of everyone but it isn't a constant theme like some of his other movies. There is a bit of a drama feel to this as the story develops we learn quite a lot about his character. It's a slow burner in places but completely intriguing with great action here and there, especially the ending where all hell breaks loose.Overall it was one of the most enjoyable Jason Statham films of the last few years.

I'm a fan of Jason Statham and action films but this left much to be desired. If I'm not mistaken the trailer shows that his little girl is taken away, this doesn't happen until the end of the movie. Most of the movie is about Statham's character laying low after being in the DEA.The action scenes are few and far between and if you have Statham in the movie and his playing a bada$$ cop, when he fights he should be able to do it with relative ease. And he does for the first couple of fight scenes that he has. But the final fight he has, he struggles against a biker dude and the choreography is terrible.Long story short, even with the low expectations I couldn't give this higher than a 5 because I was a bit bored.

James Franco's going to and graduating from NYU film school obviously didn't do anything for his acting skills. what happened to Jason statham, i remember when he had acting chops, especially comedic before he started mainly doing middle to low-end action movies. all his British movies are like gut-busting funny.all in all, a middle of the road action movie which i would rate a 5.8. i mean u could do worse or u could do better. oh BTW...fans of statham, Franco or Ryder or action movies in general can add another 1/2 star",Homefront

The story seems a little empty but the depth is there, Statham plays a strong dad in protection for his daughter when moving to a rough neighborhood.

The kind where the hero is manly, cool, charismatic, badass, etc, while the bad guy is creepy, talks a lot, and uses goons for most of his deeds.Homefront also has an excellent supporting cast (my favorites being Clancy Brown and Kate Bosworth), beautiful photography (despite many interior scenes being way too dark), good sense of pace and tension, great locations, well-acting kids, and so on.So, Homefront is almost a keeper. It is very watchable once, and almost watchable again. Except that all the action is ruined. Which is a bit of a problem for an action film.Since the 90s and the unfortunate influence of MTV video clips on Hollywood products, we've seen a lot of fights and chases hacked into a spastic mess of wtf-is-happening. Maybe you understand what I'm talking about. I've always wished they'd stop that rubbish - which makes sense only if one wants to hide a choreographer's or director's incompetence.Unfortunately, Homefront does even worse than usual in that department.

116,feyipuk,No one apologised to Izabela for her hat,8,4 October 2020,"Phil Broker is an undercover Dea agent, with a wife and kid, who gets disenfranchised after his latest case. Following his wife's death due to illness, he and his daughter - Maddy - move off the grid to what should be an idyllic retreat; a beautiful house, horse trails, river in their backyard, attractive teachers, Captain Hadley from The Shawshank Redemption as the local law, and no King Cobra Snakes. Then a kid in her class steals her hat, pushes her over, asks her if she's going to cry, so - after twice asking for the hat back - when he lunges at her, she lays him on his ass. This then sparks a family feud, that escalates and pulls in more players, all the while Phil is trying to be the decent, upstanding dad, just trying to do best by his kid.Statham plays this a lot more low key than some of his other roles, with the fight scenes being a lot tighter than some of his other roles; less bar fights and more local hicks underestimating his abilities. The screenplay was written by Sylvester Stallone, and could have been Rambo 5, though Statham is more believable as the caring dad in the backwaters than Rambo would have been. Even if Maddy was born while he was DEA, Phil seems to have a very close relationship with his daughter.
And compared to his more comedic and/or white collar roles, James Franco makes for a decent drug addled creep, trying to maintain his own position in the town, which isn't easy with his unhinged sister (Kate Bosworth) being more annoying than all the other characters put together.

If you can get by that little slip, you won't be disappointed and if you're a fan of Statham's usual films then you can expect more of the same.

132,derek-a-charette100,Another solid action movie from Jason Statham.,6,16 March 2015,"I agree with the current IMDb rating of this movie, although I would give 6.5/10 but not a 7, considering the fact that IMDb users are good, realistic film critics, and we are not quick to hand out 7-10 ratings, because we know how amazing a movie must be in order to get those high scores from us. That being said, even a movie with a 6/10 rating on IMDb will be half decent movie. Homefront is a decent movie. It was exactly what I expected out of a Jason Statham movie. Statham basically plays the same exact character in everyone of the dozens of movies he is in; but for some reason, we all still continue to enjoy his movies. One reason I think that makes it possible for Statham to portray the same character in every movie, is that his acting is RARELY forced. The character he plays comes natural to him, and is not far from how he is in real life. The biggest mistake that can ruin a would-be great movie, is bad writing and bad acting; especially in action movies. Watching actors force their lines and characters, and desperate attempts to move the plot along are the tell tale signs of a rushed, passionless, talentless movie. The reason I like Jason Statham is because he is able to make the movies flow well. Even if the script is bad, and other actors are bad, he STILL manages to hold the movies together. I have only seen 2-3 of his scores of movies that have let me down, but is expected. Nobody can make perfect movies all the time. Statham is definitely an action actor icon in this day and age. He trumps Stallone, Schwarzenegger, JC Van Damme, ""The Rock"", Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, and the rest of them. We must be careful about thinking his movies are ""cookie cutter"" or all the same, because all action movies have been basically the same for the better part of 4 decades. When watching an action movie, we know what to expect. They generally all share the same formula. However, Satham's movies have substance behind them, which is rare in action movies to begin with. Once and a while a spectacular, original action flick surfaces, like Die Hard for example. I'm not sure if Statham will ever make anymore iconic action movies, like the Transporter trilogy, Crank, or the Italian Job. Homefront is worth watching for any action fans.",Homefront
133,ActionFan-Reviews,Statham = Last Action Hero,7,30 November 2013,"Now you'd expect the typical reviews for this kind of movie from most critics, ""it's just another mindless action film"" or ""Statham can't act"". Ignore them, If your an action/statham fan you won't be disappointed.If your like me and miss the traditional action films from the past that had Charles Bronson or Chuck Norris, your gonna appreciate and like this movie. Statham is the last action hero of our time. He consistently delivers solid action movies where you know what your gonna get. In Homefront thats some bloody shootouts, great fight scenes and some good one liners. It has a good cast, People may not take James Franco seriously as a villain but it's interesting to see him in a movie like this and he does a good job with it. Kate Bosworth was very believable as a crazed meth head. It has a straight forward, thrilling story that builds the tension nicely to an action packed ending. You don't get these type of movies anymore. These days pg-13 with dumb cgi is what most ""action"" movies are about. The days of the action hero as they once were are dying out, but Statham is their to provide some vintage style action flicks like Homefront which is one of his better films. Overall, whatever your thinking - watch this movie.7/10",Homefront

The storyline was predictable and it's been done before. Louisiana white trash meth manufacturer vs. former DEA agent trying to live a quiet life with his daughter. The foul language was excessive and unnecessary - the white trash used at least 2 f bombs in every sentence.

Statham was Statham but that's no different than saying Arnold is Arnold and Sly is Sly. You watch it because it's him. And this movie didn't disappoint. Typical action film but done right, you know what's gonna happen but you're still excited to see it. It was refreshing to see something like this when a lot of these new action films screw up such a simple thing trying to make too much of it. It's a time tested storyline that somehow got lost in the 2000s with too much CGI bull... So if you like the Action Hero movies, the real ones, you'll love this.",Homefront
141,JohnnyWeissmuller,Homefront,5,25 October 2015,"Homefront, which was written and produced by Sylvester Stallone, along with frequent collaborator, Avi Lerner, began life as a vehicle for Stallone before he stood down to allow Jason Statham the leading role of a former DEA officer living in rural Louisiana with his young daughter. Directed by Gary Fleder, Statham is supported by a fine cast that includes Kate Bosworth, Winona Ryder and James Franco. The story takes hold when Statham's young daughter defends herself in the school playground against a bully. The bully's mother, played by Bosworth (who is good as a rake-thin junkie) wants retribution but finds her sleazy boyfriend to be no match for Statham. But when her brother, a local drug dealer, played by James Franco, gets involved, the stakes are raised until Statham's past comes back to haunt him. Basically, this is nuts and bolts stuff, buoyed by a strong cast and good performances, but the script offers nothing special, whilst the direction is just adequate. Although the colour palette seemed to change as much as Statham's wandering accent. It's not a bad film, nor is it unlikable, although Statham has done better and more interesting stuff recently, but this holds no surprises and does nothing unique",Homefront
142,Marthian80,Simple action movie with bad acting and weak chemistry between the characters,4,21 February 2017,"Homefront is a simple crime / action movie with Jason Statham who plays ex-DEA agent Phil Broker (again an ex-something, it's getting old..) who tries to settle down with his nine year old daughter in a quiet town. Things don't stay quiet long for Broker after his daughter knocks out a bully at school and he get's in a fight with the bully's parents. This incident draws a lot of unwanted attention to Broker, including the local drug lord Bodine (James Franco) who wants to know why Broker taught his daughter to fight like that. Can Broker shake this attention off and keep his new quiet life or not? Since it is a Statham movie, my expectations where not high but this movie was still below average. The characters where hardly worked out as believable people, there was no chemistry between Statham and the girl who is supposed to be his daughter and the story is so simple that you already know how it's going to end after watching the first twenty minutes. James Franco didn't work for me as the main bad guy, he hardly did anything to look like a bad-ass. Winona Ryder plays his girlfriend but she was probably having a bad day or something: worst performance I have seen from her so far. There was also some weird effect where they show bits of the next scene in the current scene, to make the transition between the two scenes 'special'? It looked awful and didn't work at all. It's not the worst Statham movie but if your looking for a mindless action movie your better off watching 'Killer Eliter' or 'Blitz' instead of this one.",Homefront
143,beardedmovieguy,Not Very Jason Statham Like Movie,5,2 March 2015,"Jason Statham is very Jason Statham in the Jason Statham film. The story is just so so, with a lot of boring unrealistic side plots that Jason Statham has to deal with, which he does in his routinely Jason Statham way. The action is not very Jason Statham, for a Jason Statham movie, but that is not Jason Stathams fault, he does have much to work with. James Franco on the other hand is very James Franco, except only more so James Franco then normal. His James Franconess almost makes us for the lack of Jason Stathamness, but not fully.

The key point in this movie that gets the action rolling is totally unbelievable. A deep undercover cop has a private archive of his cases in his attic at home. Even his old undercover ID card can be found there, and it is found by the criminal who sells his whereabouts to a motorcycle gang. I could bet my right hand that the whole story with the motorcycle gang is the great input of Stallone. The movie without the motorcycle gang would work even better. It could have been a nice thriller where the tension is escalating step by step between Franco and Statham. Such a screenplay would be a superior work and would make greater use of an artist like Franco. Instead everything goes up into flames of idiotism.",Homefront

146,tuhin94,Bang bang action and a cool plot,7,5 May 2014,"If you are a fan of terrific screenplay, then stop wasting your time deciding whether or not to watch this movie because you will not be wowed. Time and time again the quality of a movie gets ruined by shoddy camera work due to all the zooming in and out in this one did not serve to give it high points. I get that it is an action film filled with all kinds of baddies, but that does not mean every one of them throws around the f-bomb like there's no tomorrow. Seriously, it contends for being in the top ten worst offenders for that. Some sentences do not need it and yet, there it was, just ruining dialog. ""F*****g fetch the f*****g stick. F***!"" (That was not actually in the movie.)In the end, all the enemies died, but nothing really came out of it. You would think that the Outcasts would be larger than 10 or 15 members and would come in full force after Broker kills their main men, but it just sort of ends. Gator dies and Sheryl winds up in jail, something a tad unexpected.Even though the kidnapping sequence may evoke a lot of Taken memories, it takes after the majority of the run-time has been completed. Think of the ending as a summary of Taken: the daughter gets kidnapped and her dad punishes the bad guys (but not entirely with the same philosophy). Lastly, I loved the message of relations with your family and the people you meet in a new town. Broker possesses a personality that everyone should look up to. He gives fair warning before attacking and only fires back when assailed. And he knows that if he can end a feud by apologizing, he will do just that; no ego needs to come into play. He demonstrated just that when he told Maddy to apologize to Teddy and invite him to her birthday party. All in all, highly satisfied watching Statham kick some butt.

150,jormatuominen,"Solid screenplay, tight direction and credible local color on the Homefront",8,25 October 2018,"Homefront by Chuck Logan isn´t a well known crime novel but Sylvester Stallone obviously saw a lot of potential in it. He worked the story into a no nonsense thriller screenplay and did a real good job of it. As it is, Homefront the movie is all about making choices and taking sides as situations and allegiances shift in the fast moving scenario. This is underlined by the tight directing and some unusually competent acting for what is a pretty straightforward action thriller. Kate Bosworth and Winona Rider really shine as the seriously nasty bad bad Louisiana girls of the film. The only flaw I found in the plot is that Rachelle Lefevre is pretty much wasted as she pops up as a potential romantic interest for the main character only to disappear from the plot as it thickens. Thicken it does and as more enemies of Jason Statham´s character spiral into the Louisiana backwoods there will be surprise twists you did not see coming from long before. Unusually for a recent American film there are no plot holes. The film is shot entirely on location in small rural towns of Louisiana and early scenes in New Orleans. The filmmakers strive for realism rather than sensation and avoid the patronizing attitude and stereotypes one too often senses in Hollywood films made in this area. Having been there myself, I´d say the local color is just about right.",Homefront
151,theflixerdotcom,Homefront is an enjoyable old style action movie,6,3 February 2014,"Here we have another Jason Statham vehicle in Homefront. In this one he plays the role of Phil Broker who gets embroiled with a local meth dealer (James Franco) which quickly escalates until his past starts to catch up with him I know some may be tired of Statham playing the same character with a different back story, but in this particular movie a strong supporting cast does a good job of fleshing this out to the point where it actually became a fairly effective action movie.I found the story was a little bit of a formulatic rehashing of most lone wolf action movies (including some of Statham's), but it was very well done and Statham is very believable and bankable in his roles. He seems to be happy being type cast into a single character type, and he has learned to embrace it.That said, we have James Franco in an unusual role for him as Morgan 'Gator' Bodine. Here he plays a sneaky, dangerous meth dealer who is willing to do whatever it takes to accelerate his business. He does a great job in the role and seems to be really into his character and he seems pretty at ease in an action movie (although I found his action scenes were fairly watered down).Winona Ryder has a decent turn as Franco's girlfriend, but I can't help but think how far she has fallen in the past decade and half. We get some interesting appearances from Frank Grillo as Cyrus, Clancy Brown as Sheriff Keith Rodrigue, and the infamous Chuck Zito as biker boss Danny T. These roles are fairly minor, but I was happy to see them filled with recognizable names to add an additional layer of interest to the movie.As expected, the action and fight sequences in the movie are all well done and Statham has multiple fantastic martial arts sequences. The movie is violent, but not overly violent or disturbing. Think 80′s action movies without the cheesy dialog (it IS written by Stallone). You root for the hero and boo the baddie .and it's clear cut who is who. No brooding anti-hero here.All in all this movie was fun to watch. I think Franco could have been a little more believable if he had more action scenes, and this is a very old action movie formula, but I think it's something people may enjoy as break from all of the overly complicated and/or cartoony action heroes we have around right now. A man, his fists, his guns, and explosions! Rating: 6.5/10",Homefront

That's what I expected from this movie anyways. So I really loved it;I'm sure others liked it too.

The action is good, on the right side of believable and I enjoyed watching.What struck me the most was the downfall of Winona Ryder. After her body of work in the '90s and early '00s, I don't think she saw herself in her forties playing not even second fiddle, tweeker hillbilly waitress in a Statham film. Even her 5 second sex scene was kind of embarrassing. Her part could have been done by any actress.

157,brickmoviereviews,Homefront: Home of the Brave,6,30 November 2013,"In the southern United States, the communities are close-knit. The towns are small, and everybody knows everybody. When something happens in a town like this, word spreads fast, and reputations quickly begin to form. Former DEA Agent Phil Broker (Jason Statham) is faced with this dilemma when he and his daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), move to a small Louisiana community after his wife passes away.Broker left the DEA after he infiltrated a biker gang infamous for producing crystal meth. During the raid to take down the drug ring, things go south for the team of DEA agents sent in to apprehend the cooks inside, resulting in the kingpin, Danny T (Chuck Zito) and his son, JoJo (Linds Edwards) briefly escaping, before the police trap the both of them, killing JoJo and arresting Danny T.Fast forward two years to Broker and his daughter adjusting to their new life in Louisiana. Things for the two quickly go south when a bully steals Maddy's hat and pushes her, and then Maddy proceeds to beat him up. Enraged, the boy's mother, Cassie (Kate Bosworth), goes to her meth-kingpin brother, Gator Bodine (James Franco) to ""handle the situation."" Things quickly go up in smoke when Gator breaks into Broker's house and learns of his former career. Needless to say, stuff hits the fan.Written by Sylvester Stallone (yes, you read that correctly), Homefront is OK. It's the type of movie that you would expect to see Jason Statham star in, as he has created a nice little niche for himself as this generation's action star, traveling the same path as stars such as Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Stallone himself. The difference, and a good difference at that, is that if Stallone starred in this movie, there would be more action and less heart, however I enjoyed the movie this way.The one problem that seems to rise in Stallone's script is the plot itself. Yes, the plot is intriguing, a former DEA agent moving into a town with a meth-lord, but the way the movie was laid out was poor. Homefront starts off with a bang, providing the initial conflict with Danny T, then quickly followed by the catalytic conflict between Maddy and Cassie's son, but after that, the movie scuffed it's feet for the next hour or so. I found myself being more concerned over what happened to Maddy's missing cat that I was the characters themselves.The acting in Homefront is also mentionable. Statham's acting remains un-waivered from the countless number of action movies he has done in the past. James Franco's portrayal of Gator Bodine is, in my opinion, brilliantly played. Instead of the hothead villain we would normally see in a movie like this, Franco's Bodine is calm, cool, collected, and will probably be underrated. Winona Ryder's performance is forgettable. She did fine, but her character was randomly thrown into the mix without an introduction, and was probably unneeded. The Best Actor award for Homefront, however, goes to Izabela Vidovic for her performance as Statham's daughter, Maddy Broker. Her acting in this movie in phenomenal. In the span of 100 minutes, she is calm, tough, courageous, brave, scared, nervous, and upset – and she hits every single nail on the head. Near flawless.At the end of the day, will Homefront win any awards? Doubtful. At year's end, will it go down in history as one of the best movies of 2013? It's up there, but not that high. Homefront is your typical, run-of-the-mill action movie, which, surprisingly enough, has a good amount of heart. It should make it to Netflix soon enough, but Homefront is worth a matinée price ticket, and definitely a movie that's at least worth a shot.Rating: 6 of 10BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview",Homefront

The character he portrayed and therefore the actor Jason, were quite restrained in a not back down, special forces kick-ass kind of way. Ultimately, the body count was minimal for his type of film. The violence gratifyingly scaled back and took second place behind the story of a man trying to shield his daughter from harm in a dangerous world and disown a violent past at the same time.

Too much watching MTV by the director, far too much unnecessary fast cutting. I had no idea what was going on in most of the action scenes. Mostly it was dark, everyone was wearing Redneck check, and there was no time to grasp what was supposed to be happening. And if you aren't watching how Stratham is taking down the bad guys, what's the point of watching this sort of movie? Bad call, Director, whoever you are.

164,santiagonunez16,"It's a Jason Statham movie, what were you expecting?",9,16 January 2014,"At first glance most Jason Statham movies are pretty much about the same thing. Some quiet, keep to himself guy finds himself using exceptional fighting skills against the bad guys. Turns our he's usually the fastest gun, in this case fist in the west. This time Jason Statham is a retired-likely forced retired DEA agent who raising his daughter after his wife and her mother pass away. They move to a quiet town somewhere in Louisiana and settle in. When his daughter gets harassed by the local bully in school, she drop kicks him into another dimension--hey, she did warn him before she broke the fat tub of lard's nose. Next we meet his mother, a very loud, unrecognizable Kate Bosworth who disrespects both daughter and Statham. When she fails at intimidating him by having her husband try to assault him in the school parking lot-a one-two takedown by Statham, she enlists the help of local meth kingpin brother, James Franco. There is a back story in the beginning and some actual character development dealing with Statham's former life and an undercover cop. Frank Zito, who in my opinion is very under rated both as a character actor and villain in this case, steals the opening sequence as motorcycle gang leader bent on revenge. This movie has some exceptional fight scenes, explosions, and very intense show down between Franco and Statham that was actually pretty surprising and satisfying. This is a Jason Statham movie but a strong supporting cast of Franco and Zito steal the show as both small time and big time antagonists. Action fans will enjoy this latest blend of action and drama from the last true action star of this genre. At 100 minutes, its just long enough to hold your interest. Surprisingly, Statham's last few films have contained some human elements to their stories. While it's not going to win any major awards, this movie is sure to please action fans and others looking for a decent night out at the movies.",Homefront
165,CanadianBill,Solid Statham fare,7,5 August 2021,"Many of the usual top critics got a little too pretentious in their criticism of Homefront. Statham movies have always been designed to do one thing, that being to bring the Statham.This outing does just that, in spades. Let this one serve notice to everyone that even the smallest dumbest stupidest incident in life can quickly cascade out of all control or proportion, but especially you are messing with the wrong person.

166,octomancer,Solid action fillum,7,26 November 2018,"There is nothing wrong with this film. I thought JS's acting was pretty good. Compares favourably to other action stars' attempts over the years. I really enjoyed seeing Kate Bosworth, Winona Ryder and James Franco playing against type. Franco can be a bit hit and miss, he shines in the right roles, but others he struggles with (Annapolis for example). Definitely a hit here, his bad guy had more nuance than was strictly written into the part. Deserves a bit more than the 6.5 it's got as I write this.",Homefront

The plot was typical Statham, nothing stand out.I did try it again when I was left out of movies to see. After all Statham did great action movies in the past.The beginning of this movie is quite normal (aside Statham long hair). But here is the catch, Statham as an actor seems to have progress tremendously here.He never was a bad actor, probably one of the best in the action movie actors guilt, but his performance here, this bond he has with is little girl, the eyes, the smiles, the credible mutual understanding a girl and his dad can share is awesome.I still need to catch the end, but this is how and action movie should be done.

Scene by scene gives the thrilling atmosphere, in every fights even when there seems to be no fights anytime soon.Statham is back, gloriously beating up people while he himself is being hit too, unlike Steven Seagal.James Franco as the antagonist in this movie is just okay, he could play his role well, even though I only feel the threat from him during his first screen time. The rest of them he seems like an ordinary bad guy.In my opinion, this movie is much better than three of Statham's previous movies (Redemption, Parker, & Safe). Skip this one and you might regret it.",Homefront
169,bozabozidar,Homefront Review,6,27 September 2015,"Homefront is an action flick written by Sylvester Stalone and based on some novel. The movie's poster did not seem promising, as it was badly designed with an American flag clumsily photoshopped over the lead's body, but I decided to give it a chance on Netflix. What I got to see was nothing awe-inspiring, but also nothing awful.Stalone does not appear in this movie, and instead the main star is the former-athlete-turned-action-hero Jason Statham. He plays a DEA agent Phil Broker who, after a failed undercover mission that resulted in a bloodbath, decides to retire and live peacefully with his young daughter Maddy, played by Izabela Vidovic, in a small American town. However, this town happens to be the headquarters of a mad drug-lord known as Gator played by James Franco, who starts causing troubles to this small family. The actual reason why Gator hates the Brokers is very implausible and unclear, and has to do something with Maddy punching his nephew once in school. This small incident is apparently enough to motivate Gator to join forces with the remaining members of the gang that got busted in Phil's last mission and plan a violent revenge. I guess character motivations aren't the best part of this movie.What ensues after this buildup are some modest action scenes during which Statham beats and shoots numerous thugs while protecting his daughter. Gary Fledel does a very terrible job at directing Homefront, so most intense moments are ruined by annoying shaky cam. Statham is a good wrecking havoc and still remembers to show a little bit of emotion, but the rest of the cast gives some mediocre performances, with the exception of Franco, who is extremely unconvincing and forgettable as the villain.I liked how the movie is set in an ordinary Southern town where most of the citizens are just regular folks minding their own business and taking care of their land and families. However, that also makes me wonder why Statham is cast, since he is an Englishman and does not seem like somebody who'd enjoy riding a horse, although he does that a lot in the movie.As a whole, Homefront is obviously nothing special, but fans of action flicks and/or Jason Statham will probably find this film entertaining.",Homefront

173,taikung1,Statham always delivers,7,21 July 2014,"This story is about Phil Broker, played by Jason Statham, who moves into a small town hoping to provide a better living for his daughter. Despite his attempts to keep his nose clean, he manages to get himself into trouble with the locals including a meth dealer named Morgan 'Gator' Bodine played by James Franco that basically runs the town. Dealing with Gator and his cronies is almost manageable thanks to the ""don't mess with me"" message Broker sends to the town until his past life of a DEA agent catches up with him.The name says Homefront, but this screenplay written by Sylvester Stallone is anything but family friendly as there is plenty of vulgarity and violence in this film. If searching for something that is going to spark a little aggression, like after a bad day at work, Jason Statham always delivers a high degree of action. The film will put viewers into those situations where they'd either say, ""what would I do if.."" or ""I wish I had.."" and let's Statham play out the fight scenarios with maximum leverage.This movie had excellent fight scenes, great tactical thinking and a pretty decent story line. Everyone played their part well and for the most part we're convincing of their role. The only issue I had was with James Franco's acting ability couldn't quite sell the character he played. Thankfully all the supporting actors and actresses were able to meet this deficit and help develop the character to keep the overall scene value consistent.This isn't a movie to run out and buy for your collection, but it is a good one to experience once.",Homefront
174,jamesharrison-541-835462,Levels and Lame,2,26 March 2021,"What is it with modern day movie making?The best digital mics and audio post production facilities but nobody seems to know how to operate them.Not everyone has access to the best audio monitors in their home TV set up, so any bad audio (i.e. Too quiet or too loud) will end up either inaudible or distorted.This film had the worst of both worlds - stupidly loud bits and ridiculously mumbled quiet bits, so much so I was having to ride the levels until I couldn't be bothered any longer.Then there's the predictable nature of Stallone's screenplay. I'll just leave that there. Talk about boringly derivative.Such is the demand for films from services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix, it's now ok to produce any old garbage because clearly quantity is better than quality to attract subscribers.Homefront is another example of today's lame storytelling, and technically poor filmmaking that's now been the staple of American studios in more recent years.Go read a book instead.",Homefront

Most of Jason Stathams movies aren't expected to break records, they're just meant to entertain. Once again, I was not disappointed by the amount of ass kicking that took place in this movie. I love seeing Jason Statham do what he does best. Not only did he easily dispatch scum bags in one-on-one confrontations, but he took out groups of guys with ease. Don't expect very good dialog or story lines; just enjoy the action. I personally enjoyed the first fight when he beats up the guy everyone knows as the town wussy. James Franco was actually pretty good as the nasty, horrible villain. I was looking forward to Jason Statham actually dealing with the leader of that biker gang.",Homefront

Jason is as bad ass as he normally is, also the little girl was pretty good for her age. Ryder felt a bit just lumped in there like another else could've been in that role. James Franco is just a meh, he plays his typical ""crazy"" try hard bad ass role; which is so not bad ass. The action scenes feel pretty dope but it's a little too shaky.

179,acecomicscollect,"Home Front is good, Statham better than ever",8,2 January 2014,"We all, or least the vast majority of us, love, or at least like Jason Statham. If you fall in this category, you'll get mostly what you want with a little more character development. If for some reason, you fall in the other, small, minor category, go see this movie & become a Statham fan. Statham kicks the usual amount of butt however it his relationship with his daughter that differs from prior Statham flicks. You'll see & feel his love for his daughter as well as hers for him. James Franco is excellent as the local bad guy enforcer. He starts getting tough on his sister's request based on an incident between her son & Statham's daughter at school. Unfortunately for James, he doesn't back off his enforcer role even after his sister comes to the conclusion that Statham & his daughter are good people. When you're a local bad guy enforcer whom wants into the Meth drug business, I guess you wouldn't back off either. Oh yeah, I forgot, that would have also ended the story. Home Front gives us more warmth & more layers to the characters than we're used to from Statham flicks. For me personally, as much as I liked it, this isn't his best movie but I'm a guy. Women will like him here better than ever before. My biggest nick pick of the movie was the relationship developing between Statham & his daughter's teacher. It was completely ignored in the 2nd half of the movie so therefore, no resolution. Home Front is worth seeing, it's a very good, enjoyable movie. Go see it or definitely rent it.",Homefront

It should not have been in the movie as it adds nothing and the part is played poorly. But, according to Stallone (my guess) one needs to loose the first wife and then a child, but that will be avoided, of course.There is nothing original about the story.

191,broadest,Lost Plot and yet such potential!,2,4 March 2015,"Having read other peoples reviews on this I think a few key things are being missed about how truly bad this film is. But firstly let me start by saying that when I saw the trailer I was intrigued and excited by the suspense thriller that was potentially on offer. Of course it was never to be an intellectual film but it was meant to create suspense.The first part of the film starts badly as I cannot believe how bad Jason Stathoms American accent is and how bad his chemistry with the girl playing his daughter is affected by this. I don't believe that she is his daughter and therefore I cannot believe his desperation to save her. (put it this way in 'Taken' you can feel how badly Liam Neesom wants his daughter and that he would do everything in his power to protect her which is clearly evident when you by just a glance of Neesoms face on screen. They if anything should have cast an English girl and made out that the moved there from England.After this however the film has a chance to go somewhere as eventually we meet James Franco playing Gator. I love James Franco, hes a fantastic actor but I feel hes been let down by a strange and crazy plot and towards the end I don't even think he knows how to portray vengeance over his blown up meth lab or whether or not he actually wanted Brokers daughter to end up with him towards the end of the film probably because he cant even see where his characters coming from.Here we have Gators reputation built up through his sister and Teedo as a madman who you feel will do anything to anyone and yet all he does in the whole film is rip a toys head off, steal a cat and beat up a 12 year old in the beginning, this would have maybe sufficed but after all this the plot takes a weird turn, doesn't do anything to Phil Broker (Stathom) himself as he passes him on to a biker gang?! What? Why? I thought no-one messes with Gator? Who cares about a biker gang!The film had one last chance to redeem itself, Phil Broker sets up Gators Meth-lab to blow up when a light switch is turned on. This card should have been played a lot earlier than it is. We should have seen the meth lab blown up, see the vengeance in Gators eyes and gator should have held Brokers daughter to ransom and the film should have continued from there but instead everyone else who isn't gator has tried to kill him plus he doesn't even need to try and sneak the girl from Broker as Gator already has the daughter in his hands because of his girlfriend. So all that is left is a pointless predictable retrieval of the girl with around 5 -10 minutes of the film left.My conclusion A Bad film and not worth a second watch or the budget that was spent on it.",Homefront

And that seems to permeate his performance in this film. I want to make clear that I'm not a big action movie fan, but this film is so character-driven that, for me at least, it makes up for much of the violence. We see genuine growth in several of the characters, with some of it positive and, especially in the case of James Franco, some of it quite negative. Frankly, I felt that Jason Statham comes of age as a sympathetic good guy in this film and I hope to see what he does next. Incidentally, I want to applaud director Gary Fleder, who kept the actors grounded in reality and I never felt that any of the actors were just sleepwalking through their roles. Indeed, though his part is fairly small, James Franco does a very good job as a small time drug supplier who tries to seize an opportunity to expand his business. At first he comes across as sensible as he observes his sister's increasing problems with drugs, but then morphs into a very bad guy himself, and I love the way that director Fleder lingers on Franco's face as he watches his world collapsing right in front of him. And I'd also like to single out Mark Isham's very atmospheric music (mixed with a lot of appropriately noisy rock cues), and what we would call the ""love theme,"" heard best near the end, is gorgeous. This film is unexpectedly satisfying, and, after it was over, I went back to re-watch a few crucial scenes.

After his daughter deals with a school bully the furious boy's mother (Bosworth) turns to her crazy meth cooking brother (Franco) to spare the boys embarrassment. Events escalate and Stathams history with a biker gang comes back for vengeance.The plot is as old as they get, and within the first 5 minutes the film has 'Stallone' written all over it. Screen written by Stallone we're frequently treated with some great little big-guy-picks-on-little-guy fight scenes as you'd expect from a Stallone/Statham film but the film fails to dish out that testosterone finale we'd expect from those two.Kate Bosworth plays a fantastic meth-head red-neck mother and almost steals the show had she had more appearances. Franco shows he has the ability to play a more sinister darker role but doesn't quite deliver. Winona Rider was simply awful as Franco's waitress girlfriend, but we're told she's actually an ex biker chick. Having seen every episode of Sons of Anarchy the two franchises clearly have a different definition for Biker-chick. It was nice to see Clancy Brown appear as the mediating Sheriff and he performs his role adequately. Statham is...well.... Statham. Just as you'd expect.

Jason Statham is not acting but seem loosing his time playing a role that has no substance, a smile here, another smile there. There is still a couple of action scenes that bring some excitement, but no more. Many technical elements are typically old fashioned, Rocky Balboa style, hard blue lights creating a false night ambiance pulling you out the action. The screenplay itself is insubstantial, containing crucial errors like the fact that Broker would let the secret file containing all details of his previous life as an undercover cop, right on the top of an open box in his open basement. Such a silly point plays indeed a crucial role in the development of the screenplay, making the whole structure ridiculous. Some characters of the story also appear and disappear as for instance the teacher who seems to have a key role to play but who's totally missing from the second part of the movie...

However, I still think the school counsellor/teacher, Susan Hetch, and Phil Broker, (Jason Statham) should have got together in the end, it would have been a nice end to the film, but overall, I really did enjoy this film, and was pleasantly surprised at the standard of it, a great film, well deserved 9 stars.",Homefront
206,snsenica,The movie can be fun but the plot makes little sense.,3,24 June 2016,"The film starts with a botched raid by the DEA which ends in more dead guys since Gettysburg. The good guy Broker moves to a small town in the South where most of the white people are retarded SOBs. The daughter who appears to be mentally ill lacks even rudimentary survival understanding. For some bizarre reason a big BOY picks a FIGHT with this pretty little girl. Every guy in town wants to beat Broker up up, although he is the meanest bad ass in the whole state. As a chip off the old block she beats the crap out of the boy. Good luck to the man who marries her if she ever learns to like boys. Give a copy to your worst enemy.

207,jamieeaston57,a statham movie keeping up to date,8,15 May 2014,"I was very pleased with this movie. Its got the action you want, a believable story to keep the momentum going and a handful of good actors to support it.First of all, I LOL at all the people criticizing the plot, dialog, character development etc, again let me LOL. People watch Jason's movies for the a** kicking action and fight scenes. I will admit, some of his movies I think about giving up at the half way mark, but this was one of his better films for sure. Transporter, Homefront, Hummingbird would be my favorite Statham movies not including the Guy Ritchie classics of course. 8/10 will definitely watch again.",Homefront
208,kaaykoi,I tried,5,29 January 2021,"I really really really tried to like this movie. I absolutely love Jason Statham movies. This movie has good plot and some really good acting from a majority of the cast but two things bothered me. The first thing is tiny but it's a big pet peeve of mine, if you are going to have people 'native' to an area make sure you know how to pronounce the city. Not a single person in this movie could pronounce Shreveport courtly. And the second thing was Winona Ryder's atrocious ""acting"". This woman's crappy acting just about ruined this movie for me. She can not act to save her like and kept making me cringe every time she cursed. It did not sound organic or real coming from her mouth, almost like a little kid not being used to cursing. the woman who played Cassie I think would have done great in her part she really brought authenticity to her character.",Homefront
209,mbednar10,James Franco?,7,26 January 2021,"I LOVE Jason Statham, and I think he is an amazing action actor and so great in all his roles. But give me a break with the casting. Jason is supposed to be afraid of James Franco? There is no scenario I can fathom where Franco would be intimidating to Jason Statham. One terrible casting choice kinda messed up everything but it's still Statham laying beatings and showing protection for a young child and that's his wheelhouse. Still gets a 7, especially because it's the weird hillbillies who think they run things getting beat up.",Homefront
210,randybombardier,good entertaining,8,22 February 2015,Thought it was s good entertaining movie although somewhat predictable. Daddy is trying to just live out his life but trouble seems to follow in this rural Louisiana town where Statham is hiding out. Never quite sure if he's retired or in hiding. Low profile is blown and he fights but also tries not to fight and make a normal life for his daughter. He even apologizes to a couple of dirt bags but the word out on him. Don't want to spoil but finally he has to deal with some old enemies. Great ending. Good fight scenes and I personally like the setting since Louisiana is the only state in the south I haven't been to. I don't write reviews for as living but I like movies that don't drag and have a clear resolution. Some story some action but not overdone. Action sequences don't go on forever.,Homefront

I actually quite like Statham but this is poorly written stuff by Sly Stallone and about as predictable as it gets, poor old Jason doesn't even get to kick much ass either. There is no depth of character and most if not all of them are clichéd especially the little brat kid. God knows what Franco, Bosworth & Ryder are doing in it, decent actors all but not here.This story has been told countless times before and this version doesn't add anything new or fresh, certainly no surprises.So is there anything worth recommending about it?

The acting was good. Story was good. Nice action scenes. Good dialogue. Some people gave this movie a 1 or a 2 and that was seriously not the case. I mean really. There's movies out there like Apocalypse Pompeii that got a rating of +/- 2 stars and these people want to tell me that this movie was worse?

I agree 100% with Slasher_Lover23's review of this movie. There, I did what I have always chided others for doing.I have been a fan of Statham's action movies from day one. Those were never GREAT movies, but better than good. Very entertaining. He pulled this change of the status quo off very well. Like all of Statham's movies, there is no reason to get upset over the violence or try to over analyze any aspect of the picture. Fans of Statham know what to expect and he always delivers in true form. It was nice to see him stretch a little this time out.",Homefront

But the F-bomb in every sentence of the movie, used as every part of speech in some? Stallone wrote the screenplay, which must indicate that Sly has lost some brain cells somewhere along the way and can't think of English words that might be used as dialog. Stallone must have written 500 F words into this movie. Really, if the 10 year old actress in this movie was on the set for more than 2 minutes, Stallone should be reported for child abuse just for exposing her to the awful repetition of ""f'ing"" this and ""f that."" There were literally points in the movie where there was loud action (think 12 gouge shotgun going off right beside your ear) and somehow Stallone managed to have someone off-screen mutter ""F...!!"" Do not see this if you like meaningful or even trite dialog in your movies. I literally lost IQ points sitting through it.",Homefront

The story is good it holds form and gives the film drive. I enjoyed Jason Statham's character, however I was left with the sense of an underachievement in the part he played, more specifically the lines he was given, I felt as though seen as he is an English Geezer, and his character is one with an English accent, he could have used coarser language than what was used, such as throwing the C word around a bit as at times I felt it would have brought more to his character and made his lines feel and have greater impact. However, I understand that this word doesn't hold the same power in America and other countries as it does in the UK, and as the was written by Sly Stallone it is understandable that the word didn't factor in the film, however when watching the film you will understand that his lines would be better if the word was added to them.",Homefront
218,citrusbitrus,A Must for Stratham Fans. Enjoyable but lacking in plot and character development.,6,13 March 2014,"The upside: Stratham in classic form, at his scowling/ gruffly lovable/ honourable 'In the face of flying fists, knives n guns' best. Typical ""young girl in varying degrees of peril"" set pieces, Leading to a whole heap of stratham kicking ""hillbilly"" ass with some sweet MMA inspired moves. With all this tempered by the obligatory father/daughter bonding. The Downside: Gaping plot-holes into which tumbled the bulk part of the woefully under developed cast of characters (Franco's weedy small town villain, the biker-man's attack dog/ posse leader, beloved dead wife, sexy teacher/ lurve interest, the bully's hillbilly ""bad guys come good"" parents, the dodgy sheriff, Wanna Ryder's 'tart with a crack coated heart' and even to some extent, our heroic father daughter pairing...). Added to this, Franco's best attempts at villainy made for a sneaky, yet puzzlingly satisfying antagonist. The ending was tainted by the fact that it was hardly a fair fight between the two of them after a fairly premature showdown between Jase and another hard nut... Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this bread and butter action flick and appreciated the feel good Vibes it inspired. Like any good Jason fan Will. oughta",Homefront

This movie has all the elements to make a good Action-thriller film showing Father Daughter relationship, good action sequences etc. The scenic beauty of a small town are very well captured.

225,feagansf,Homefront,10,20 April 2021,"In this film review I will be arguing that Sylvester Stallone knows how to write a good film, especially when Jason Stathom plays the main character (Phil Broker).The screenplay writer did a good job giving the right lines to the right characters and it was overall a good movie. Phil Broker and his daughter Maddy move to a small town in louisiana, trying to move on from the past. He wants a good life for his daughter but that doesn't go as planned when he comes across Gator, the meth druglord of the town, who leads a drug traffic. His home and daughter are put in danger so he does everything he can to protect them.When the protagonist, Phil Broker, said ¨you see that house? It's my house, anyone who comes around it again will find me standing in it¨ (Homefront, Gary Fleder, Jason Statham, Open Road Films, 2013) directed towards the antagonist, Gator, it brought tension, it made you think to yourself is Gator ever going to stop being the villain? Was he gonna back off of Phil and his daughter and stay away from their house after Phil blew his laboratory and warehouse up?I would recommend this movie if you like thriller crime movies, their is alot of tension that builds up throughout the movie. Jason Stathom is a good actor, his face expressions or the tone in his face makes it more believable when watching the movie.",Homefront

230,Jeseabrooke1,Absolutely Awful! Why.... WHY!?!,1,26 November 2013,"I rarely write reviews for movies that I have watched, because my view seems to be pretty in-line with what others have wrote.I went into this movie expecting absolutely nothing, my friend wanted to watch it and I had never seen so much as a preview. The beginning was so far fetched and contrived that a sense of dread settled over me within the first 10 minutes... there was no escape. I was watching this.As the story dragged me along it's nonsensical series of events, I looked around and noticed that only 5 other people were along this journey with me, which made me feel good. Others would be spared due to this most likely becoming a huge flop.I watched Sharknado on Netflix the night before, which was so bad it was good. This was borderline bad, which is far worse. It hovers in some sort of realm between loathing and rage, filled with meth addicts and poor character development.Then it happened. The vindictive off biker gang bent on revenge came to the home of the international narc to seek revenge for killing some dude in prisons son. The main character takes his daughter and hides her in a safe place from the intruders.... UNDERNEATH THE FRONT PORCH AND VISIBLE TO EVERY MURDEROUS VILLAIN THROUGH THE LATTICE! You win father of the year dude.I never went to film school, so my review most likely sounds equally idiotic.

231,mattywheeler-801-49515,Mostly as expected...,7,7 March 2014,"OK, first off, this *is* a Statham film... but it's a good'n. The negatives for me were the casting of James Franco and Winona Ryder. I don't have anything against them as actors, I just don't think they were at all right for their roles. They could have maybe got away with Ryder, but I think they might have missed a trick with Franco's character; a better casting there could have had quite an impact. Anyhoo, if you enjoy a Statham film, you'll know what you're in for and you won't be disappointed. The situation in which the film is set is contrived, Statham's skills (and armoury) are somewhat inexplicable... but you've already accepted that before it's started, so sit back and enjoy the action! I agree with what some reviewers are saying about being able to see the Stallone influence. I think this film does quite a good job of showing why Sly and Statham make a good team. I'm looking forward to more.",Homefront

There is some violence, drugs and rough language, but I highly recommend this movie. I took my 13 year old daughter and we were on the edge of our seats. I thought it was very believable and the actors/actresses did an outstanding job. I would have liked more romance between the main character and the school psychiatrist, but it still totally worked. I think this would be a good date movie. Ladies, this is a great movie to see with your guy if you want to cuddle up and hang on to him. I think this is the best movie I've seen in quite awhile.

233,capitolconcepts,Loved it! Critics: Go pound sand.,9,8 December 2013,"Jason Statham never disappoints! This film features a seasoned ensemble of actors, all playing well-developed, highly interesting characters. It was great to see Winona Ryder back on the big screen (I missed her)and working alongside the uber talented James Franco, who plays a seriously sick dude(his forte).Kate Bosworth's character was so incredibly annoying that I almost plugged my ears at one point just to shut her voice out - and I mean this as a sincere compliment to her acting skills in this movie. The only unbelievable part was that someone as savvy as Jason Statham's character would choose to move his daughter to this remote, hillbilly town, especially after the trauma of just having lost her mother. Otherwise, it was well-paced and action- packed, with the right amount of dry humor - perfectly delivered, and at all the right moments. I thought it was a solid storyline and enjoyed the characters so immensely, that I already want a sequel! It was pure enjoyment from beginning to end, so pay no mind to the so-called ""critics"" and the naysayers. Stallone knows how to deliver an entertaining flick and he's done it again.

Come on...this is a guy that's offered a lot of scripts. That he would sign on to this film tells me Stallone threw some crazy big money his direction.

I did notice that it didn't have the perfect score, and I figured, well, the majority votes come from 13 year old's - and they probably like movies aimed at a younger audience, so I watched it. The movie production itself is quite okay, but the story-line and acting coming together - is far fetched. I don't know if the acting so so hapless, but whatever the reason be - this is a movie you should never watch, unless you intend to waste time you'll never gain back in your existence. The production cast probably hired an in-experiences director - but then again, the actual dialog is pathetic to say the least.",Homefront
236,pieter-brijs,Well made movie with great actors!,8,26 March 2014,"The plot of the film is about Phil Broker who is a DEA agent and has a daughter called Maddy. They move to a small town because he has a terrible history with a biker gang. A new story starts when his daughter fights with an abdominous boy on school because he was bullying her. It comes true that the boy's parents are first class drug dealers so Broker gets in trouble with them. His past emerges again and he comes in contact again with the criminality and cruelty as DEA agent. The film is produced by Gary Fleder, who is director and producer and lives in Virginia, USA. Jason Statham is my favorite actor. Therefore, I like each film where he plays in. Statham is known for the trilogy of The Transporter, Crank and The Expendables. He has the character he will always have in a film : he brings action and is always the hero. He fits perfectly in his role because there is also a strong father-daughter-relationship which makes it more emotional and engrossing. This is a perfect example for type-casting, when he has to play in a romantic movie, he would not fit in his role, I think. Besides this, James Franco has the badguy-role as drug dealer. He's made for this kind of role so he expresses himself very well. I was also impressed by Izabela Vidovic, who plays the role of Broker's daughter. I swear, she will be known as a great actress in the future, she can scream, cry and be emotional all at the same time. If you want to be a witness, watch the movie, she's really impressive. The movie is recorded in a typical American landscape what makes it more beautiful, like their house that is built against a lake, in pure nature with horses and trees everywhere. A disadvantage about the film is the scene where everything gets burnt (the wooden house, drugs and Franco's properties) because it was clear that the flames were not real. Therefore I think there isn't much money spent on special effects. The costumes were all well chosen, a bit agricultural with a cropped shirt and jeans pants. I can't say much about the camera work so I don't have any comments on this subject. I really recommend this movie, it's a typical Jason Statham film and if you love action, drama and a bit of romance in one film, this movie is perfect for you.",Homefront

Then in once, Statham has a bad reputation because of one fight. Then the story becomes cliché, Phils reputation becomes worse and everyone wants to kill him. the daughter of Phil, Maddy, annoyed me a lot.

240,heckerethan,"Good movie, doomed to a terrible demographic.",10,25 January 2015,"First off, the only reason this movie gets a ten out of ten from me is to try and balance out the unfair average score it's been given.I never really liked Statham, he just never stood out to me as a particularly great actor, and certainly isn't my favorite. But I can say for a fact that I've yet to watch a movie from him that I've not enjoyed. Homefront is an interesting beast, combining psychological thriller and vigilante action-flick, which is quite alright in my book. In fact, there were plenty of times were my heart-strings were pulled, as an American male, living in the south during these times in the war on drugs, I was able to connect enough with Statham's character, even if I never worked in law- enforcement.Unfortunately, this is pretty much the movie's downfall, seeing as we live in a time where it's frowned upon to have any sort of pride or ability to defend yourself or your family, and God forbid you like a movie that teaches you such things. Basically, what I'm saying is that if you're a bleeding heart wuss who doesn't like seeing drug-dealers getting their just-desserts, then you won't like this movie, and should probably go watch a Michael Moore movie or some mess.However, if you're a fan of action, suspense, and watching the bad-guys get the snot beat out of them, this is definitely a good movie for you.",Homefront
