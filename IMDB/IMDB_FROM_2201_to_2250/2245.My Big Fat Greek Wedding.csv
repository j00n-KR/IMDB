0,MartinHafer,This is the ultimate date film--so why is it's overall rating 6.7?,10,31 August 2009,"I've seen MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING twice, so I am pretty sure about what I saw...yet for the life of me, it's overall rating is a relatively paltry 6.7 (as of 8/09). Considering how much money this film made and how well-crafted it was, this score just seems way too low---especially since this is the ultimate date film--there simply is no better.What I liked about the film in particular is that it has appeal to both men and women and this cannot be said of some ""chick flicks"". Sure, it has romance and kissing and the like, but it also is funny, warm and enjoyable on many levels. Heck, I could even see older kids enjoying the film--whether or not they are Greek.The film consists of a wonderful ensemble cast. While there are some famous actors in the film (such as John Constantine, Lanie Kazan and Andrea Martin), these are not necessarily household names and the rest of the cast are pretty much unknowns. This is NOT a problem, as it increases the believability of the film and these unknowns all proved they could really act--and have no reason to stay unknown for long.Considering that my review is coming years after the film was released and there are already a ton of other reviews, I won't bother to beat a dead horse and discuss the plot. The bottom line is that this is a brilliant film. On one hand, it all seems so simple and slight, but on the other the film really delivers in every possible way. So many funny and wonderful moments--be sure to have a few Kleenex when you watch this sweet film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
1,Leofwine_draca,Overbearing,3,14 September 2021,Sometimes I try watching a different genre to see how I get on with it. Usually not very well and that's the case with this much-loved crowd-pleaser. I found the tone overtly sentimental and the characters overbearing.,My Big Fat Greek Wedding
2,SnoopyStyle,love the family,7,2 September 2016,"In Chicago, Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) is a 30 year old Greek spinster. She has always been the frumpy outsider from a large family. Her proud Greek father wants her to marry a nice Greek boy and have a bunch of Greek kids. She works at the family restaurant where Ian Miller (John Corbett) comes in one day. She falls for the tall teacher immediately. She decides to go back to school to study computers and her mother convinces her father. She starts working at Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin)'s travel agency. She meets Ian again and they start dating before getting her father's approval.I like the family more than the couple. Vardalos and Corbett are not necessarily top rank actors. They don't make for a great rom-com pairing. What excels is the extended Greek family. They are all great and each one brings fun joy. The movie drags when it focuses on the couple. It's not like their relationship is that compelling or dramatic. They are functional but the family is excellent.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
3,claudio_carvalho,An Enjoyable Entertainment for Whole Family,8,22 July 2003,"Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos, also the screenplay writer) is a single thirty years old Greek woman, living with her parents and brother in a Chicago Greek community. After convincing her father to go to the university, she meets the non-Greek Ian Miller (John Corbertt) and they decide to get married. Her father does not accept the wedding of his daughter with a non-Greek man. The situations in the breast of the Portokalos family, naive most of the times and very funny, make with film a worthwhile entertainment for the whole family.

4,kosmasp,Keep it Greece,5,11 November 2016,"It's tough to watch something from outside and be able to tell how someone else is going to experience something that you yourself are very familiar with. Also I don't think Italian families are that different. But it's a nice touch to see the Greek community get some. Although some may be an understatement. The movie went big, leading independent movie grosses (maybe still the highest grossing independent movie in America? I haven't checked lately) when it was released.Does that make a good movie? Not necessarily, it actually brings out a lot of people who may watch this and look for things that went wrong. And this is so cliché that it is prone and susceptible to attacks. There are a couple of moments where I actually had to laugh, but that was not enough to actually enjoy the whole thing. Don't get me wrong, all the people involved seem nice and cool and everything, but I just didn't think they achieved everything that was possible (watch Highway to Hellas to see how it's really done).",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
5,lee_eisenberg,when ethnic people marry gentiles...,10,28 July 2005,"As we all know from watching movies, gentiles are boring, while ethnic people are wacky and brazen (think ""Meet the Fockers""). Of course, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" teaches us that the Hellenes are louder and weirder than anyone. The story has Greek-American Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) falling in love with WASP Ian Miller (John Corbett). Toula has an insanely giant family in which everyone is embarrassing, while Ian has a tiny family in which no one ever talks.Probably this movie's coolest aspect is the fact that it came out of nowhere and went on to become one of the top 50 grossing movies of all time (especially since it was released the same weekend as the apparently ridiculous ""Scorpion King""). So, whether you're a good Greek, or an ""exeno"" who wishes that he was Greek, you're sure to love this movie and its soundtrack. Opa!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
6,blanche-2,a movie many of us can relate to,6,10 April 2005,"I really enjoyed ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" I think anyone of Italian, Greek, Jewish - well, just about any descent, can really appreciate the humor.Of course, it has a little bit of fantasy in it as well as reality with the introduction of the John Corbett character. He is a hunk, and I think from that point on, the film becomes a little less realistic for many but still great fun. This is a very funny, warm film, with some excellent performances from Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin, Michael Constantine, etc.They say write about what you know, and this is a great case in point. The entire family situation feels right on with some hilarious scenes. I'm not sure how long the film is, but it flew by.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
7,Quinoa1984,"On the same grade level as Monsoon Wedding, fun if absolutely formulaic",6,7 June 2002,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding is cluttered with so much eccentricism and ikeability that those who identify with it more will enjoy it more.  I wouldn't see it again, at least for some long period of months, mainly because after a while it became somewhat heavy-handed and had absolutely no where else to turn after its main points were made. Now I know this is a romantic comedy and all, but how amny times do you see the guy use Windex and NOT think that it's hilariously original and magnificent. 
But, anyway, it is a good date movie, especially for older couples, and those who might know greeks more will be in on the in-jokes it makes from time to time (although it leaves out that old stereotype of, um, well, it is PG-13 so I shouldn't mention it here).  Plus, Nia Vardalos is one of the most charming women I've seen on screen this year which helps.  Despite its shortcomings (which it has up until the end), it has its originality, like the house.

8,ComedyFan2010,Makes me want to never marry Greek!,7,5 November 2014,"This is one of the romantic comedies when an unlucky girl finally gets lucky and finds the best guy ever! And added to this is her crazy Greek family that makes us all laugh.Well I have seen in some reviews people saying that there are many movies about such ethnic wedding but I can't think of any other, which is maybe why I did like the movie.I wouldn't care for the main plot, it is pretty much nonexistent. The groom (John Corbett) is pretty much characterless artifact being pushed around and not minding it. But those things are not really important for the movie, it is mainly about the constant laughs made on small jokes and not the main plot.And those work pretty well. They make me overlook one sided characters, the fact that her dad whom we should like is an old fashioned sexist bigot, the clumsy ""transformation"" of Toula. The good part is that the joke comes one after the other, so I can see why this movie was so popular in its time",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
9,edwagreen,****,10,22 August 2015,"Wonderful film depicting strong family and ethnic ties. Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan are terrific as the parents of a 30 year old daughter, unmarried and looking as if she shall settle into a grim spinsterhood.Along comes an American teacher and love blossoms in record time and the two prepare for marriage.The film is a living testament to the fact then when you marry, you also marry the family.

11,jotix100,I need Windex in my Moussaka!!!!,8,11 July 2002,"This was a very pleasant surprise. Frankly, I was avoiding it because I thought it was going to be too tacky for my taste. It turned out that I needed some of the Windex, the father of the bride uses for everything, to clear my eyes and enjoy the film.Nia Vardalos has written from the heart this story of a crazy Greek family with all the stereotypes in it for us to savor and enjoy what has come out under the firm direction of Joel Zwick. Not only is Ms. Vardalos talented as an actress, but she can write quite a story, star in her own tale, and bring together this cast of loonies and make us believe we are inside these folks' home. Michael Constantine and Lanie Kazan are the parents of the bride and they preside this crazy household in Chicago. Nia Vardalos is the ""ugly duckling"" we see at the beginning of the film and she wins John Corbett's heart and disarms him completely. He got her family in the bargain and he's stuck in it for better of for worse. Andrea Martin is very effective as the pushy aunt.All in all, it should be seen for the fun of it. This is a funny film, very well paced and acted. Please pass the Windex!!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
12,lastliberal,Because I came alive when I met you,7,9 May 2007,"I lived in Crete for two years and I found so much in this film to enjoy that it is a favorite. Having said that, I would imagine that those who are not familiar with the Greek world would be a little lost and maybe not enjoy it as much as I did.Truly, Nia Vardalos, who starred as Toula, wrote a brilliant screenplay and gave everyone a window into the Greek world. It is a fun world where family is most important. I really mean MOST important. Knowing this one fact is critical to enjoyment of the movie. My landlord in Crete built a three-story apartment. The top floor was theirs and the bottom two floors were rented until their daughter was married. They would provide a place for her to live. Their relatives occupied other apartments on the block. They made frequent trips to the village to see other relatives. This is all strange to me, who basically sees family only when someone dies.The movie is all about Toula and Ian (John Corbett) trying to stay together while the family learns to accept him, and he learns the family's customs and ways. This is what makes for good comedy.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
13,evanston_dad,Feature Length Stand-Up Skit,6,5 August 2010,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" plays out like a 15-minute stand-up comedy routine stretched over a 90-minute running time.Nia Vardalos takes aim at her big, Greek family, and the film is full of fairly stale material about how overbearing they are, how hairy they are, how loud they are, and how much they like to eat. Any number of Woody Allen films have already covered this terrain, but I guess there's always room for one more. To her credit, Vardalos is a pleasant actress and she has a winning quality to her that makes the film painless to sit through.She received an Academy Award nomination for her original screenplay.Grade: B",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
14,ferguson-6,A Big Fat Good Movie,9,29 June 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  The anti-Hollywood.  This movie reminds me of why I fell in love with movies so many years ago.  Great dialog, characters you care about, and a story that is alive.  Nia Vardalos wrote and stars as Toula, a Greek trying oh so desperately to escape the shackles of her family.  Once she does, she comes alive, yet comes to realize how wonderful her family is ... in their own strange way.  John Corbett as her love interest is just quirky enough to make us think this could happen.  The best performance of the movie is given by Toula's dad, Michael Constantine (about 30 years removed as the principal of ""Room 222"").  He cares so much for his family and his greek heritage that it hurts us to watch at times. Don't get me wrong, this is a full fledged comedy, yes even a romantic comedy!  On your second viewing, check out Toula's eyes - they seem to sparkle, even dance, at times.  If she has this true ability, we may see more of her as an actress.  Lainie Kazan gives another of her wonderful performances as the mother, or the ""neck"" of the family.  I would have like to have seen the brother's character developed a little more - I have the feeling there was more in the original story.  Check out N'Sync's Joey in a few scenes.

15,anaconda-40658,Use Windex.,9,4 June 2015,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002): Dir: Joel Zwick / Cast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin: Wonderful comedy about culture and acceptance. Written by and starring Nia Vardalos as a waitress at her family restaurant. She explains the weird environment for which she was raised. Her family is Greek and she is pressured by her father to marry into Greek and have children. Enter John Corbett who takes notice of her and romances blooms. He isn't Greek therefore the family is unsettled. Although structured like a sitcom the screenwriter has fun with the culture theme while director Joel Zwick times the humour perfectly. With that said, the family portrayed here is comically exaggerated yet not without realistic feeling. Vardalos is hilarious as she struggles to understand her family. This is a great lead performance that showcases great potential for future projects. Corbett makes a great foil, which leads to a hilarious meeting between both sets of parents. Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan play the parents who are driven by tradition but hilariously devastated at the thought of their daughter breaking it by marrying outside it. Andrea Martin makes a worthy comic turn as an aunt. Despite its sitcom elements and an ending that is predicted long before it gets there, it is still a great comedy about family, tradition and a pig roast in the front yard.

16,mm-39,It is never too late in life,8,11 February 2003,"That is the message I got from this film.  It is nice to see a fellow Winnipeger doing well.  I thought this movie was going to be an Artsie film, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I understand the humour in this film as I grew up in East Kildonan and a lot of my friends' families were this way. All cultures have the good and the bad, but in the end it is what type of people they are.  I believe Windex will fix anything.  I wonder how much of this is from real life or was it all made up.  It was worth renting.  This one should of been one that I should of seen in the theatre.8/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
17,StevePulaski,"No pop culture footprint = no offense, sort of",6,24 March 2016,"It's intriguing to note that despite My Big Fat Greek Wedding still boasting the title of the ""highest grossing romantic comedy,"" like most romantic comedies, the impact this left on pop culture as a whole was slight and almost unrecognizable; similar to James Cameron's Avatar, still the highest grossing film worldwide, yet a film that sparks nothing but opinions that go against what people initially thought of the film. If My Big Fat Greek Wedding doesn't speak volumes about the genre of romantic comedies, I'm not sure what does.It's not necessarily that My Big Fat Greek Wedding is forgettable, but even worse, it kind of is what it is; a one-note joke or a Saturday Night Live skit stretched out to feature-length. The result is a film that incites a few smiles, chuckles, and an interesting indie sleeper hit story, but nothing more. Couple these features with the fact that this film's ending is just about the most unsurprising and corniest ending about family, acceptance, and difference I've yet to see in film, and you have a romantic comedy that really can't measure up to its level of monetary success by proving its much different than its less-impacting counterparts.The film revolves around Fotoula ""Toula"" Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), a quirky Greek woman in the middle of a fierce midlife crisis. At thirty, she is unmarried and ostracized by her parents Gus and Maria (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) for failing to find a man and become a ""baby machine"" like her older sister Athena (Stravroula Logothettis) to further give her parents purpose in their elderly years. Toula states early on in the film that the three prime expectations of Greek women are to marry a Greek boy, make Greek babies, and ""feed everyone until the day she dies."" Toula's parents are traditionalist Greeks in the sense that they wet guests' faces with kisses when they walk through the door, overstuff their guests with food, and, specifically Gus, try to cure every human ailment with Windex. Because of that, they seem to believe that all other people who aren't Greeks are secretly in denial of their heritage and wish they were Greeks. The family is in for a culture shock, however, when Toula meets and falls madly in love with Ian Miller (John Corbett), a handsome and kind school teacher, who just so happens to be non-Greek and lack any kind of discernible heritage, typical for many people who are fourth or fifth generation immigrants where culture is subsequently lost in the shuffle of assimilation.Regardless, the state of the family is sent into a dramatic tailspin by Toula's traditionalist parents, who can't see how this man is capable of anything without having a Greek background. The film becomes a story of Gus and Maria needing to accept their daughter's newfound beau, in addition to a story about Ian learning to accept Toula's parents for their very conservative and sometimes narcissistic view of their own heritage.The result is a film predicated off of lampooning, satirizing, and overblowing common conventions of Greek people, none of which so much as negative or harmfully stereotypical as much as they are pretty simple-minded and predictable. Having said that, the actors and actresses on hand make My Big Fat Greek Wedding the moderately enjoyable experience that it is, particularly Vardalos, who throws herself into the autobiographical tale of meeting her husband getting the respect that both her and him deserved. Before the big screen, which consisted of little else besides a $5 million budget from IFC Films and studio executives crossing their fingers that word of mouth would carry this picture, Vardalos conducted this project as a stage-play, in a manner that recalls the zealous energy exhibited by Tyler Perry to get noticed in the public eye. Assisted by a cast of spirited performers, particularly Michael Constantine, who knows how to tight-rope walk the fine line of overacting and emphatically portraying a brazen archetype of a character, Vardalos and her screenplay really cannot lose in the acting department.The problem, I suppose, with My Big Fat Greek Wedding is just how simple of a film it is. When you find out the film is largely about changing peoples' prejudices, which, to be fair, aren't really harmful in an explicit or predatory sense and more-or-less exist as the kind of impulsive small talk families create over Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner, the conflict really becomes silly at best. While this kind of friction definitely exists, there are more compelling stories to be told about a lack of acceptance in a family and this film, with its dramatic depictions that ultimately wind up conveying a silly sense of screwball comedy, get rather repetitive after a while and one is left trying to rest the weight of the film's quality on the shoulders of the performers, which isn't entirely fair for a comedy.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the perfect ""rainy Sunday"" film in that it's simple enough where you could watch it over and over again and not get tired of it thanks to its generally upbeat and silly nature; a feel-good film, if you will, despite the fact that lead character is often made to feel bad. One could say it oversimplifies the everlasting hell out of Greeks and Greek culture, but circumventing to my point about this film leaving relatively no cultural footprint, I don't even think you could make such an argument. Save such for a film with an impact outside of the monetary sense.Starring: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, and Stravroula Logothettis.

19,=G=,Very good but not -that- good.,7,13 February 2003,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a delightful romantic comedy about a frumpy 30'ish Greek wallflower who makes herself over, meets Mr. Right, and has a big, fat Greek wedding. With plaudits from critics and populace alike, this warm-hearted little comedy may have trouble living up to its reputation almost guaranteeing disappointment with a sequel. Though the story isn't anything creatively new and unique (as was ""Memento"" for example) this grass-roots-driven flick was the right film in the right place at the right time. With lots of loving ethnic fun-poking, the usual culture clashing, oodles of exaggerated stereotypes, and chock full of Vardalos' bemused and detached brand of humor and sentiment, this ""mouse that roared""  is worth a look by anyone into romcom fare. (B)",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
20,sddavis63,Entertaining And Fast Paced,9,15 February 2003,"I really enjoyed this movie, based on the real-life experiences of Nia Vardalos, who wrote the script and starred as Toula, a 30ish Greek woman, apparently destined to life without marriage, who suddenly meets and falls in love with Ian (John Corbett) who - to the horror of Toula's traditional Greek father (Michael Constantine) - is not Greek! This very funny movie follows Toula as she tries to overcome her family's hesitance about the marriage across ethnic lines and only-child Ian, raised by quiet and introverted and now bewildered parents (played magnificently, by the way by Bruce Gray and Fiona Reid) as he tries to adjust to becoming a part of this big, boisterous family.This movie has a bit of everything you want for an evening of entertainment. It's funny. It's romantic. It's touching. There's nothing in it that would prevent you from watching it with your kids. It's just a fun 90 minute romp. (If I have any criticism of it at all, it would be that it's a bit too frenetic and fast-paced in some ways. How did Toula's father come around so quickly? How did the wedding day appear so suddenly?)A very entertaining movie.9/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
21,thesar-2,The Windex® of the Lambs,6,9 July 2016,"In 2016, we were granted yet another sequel no one was asking for and so, it sparked me to see the original a second time. I remember seeing My Big Fat Greek Wedding one time only in theatres 14 years ago and loving it. I laughed out loud and found it charming, an interesting look into a stereotypical Greek family and romantic. But, the laughter I had, mostly about the Grandma's escape plans and the Windex® commercials, I recall the most.Sadly, almost a decade and a half later, it didn't hold up. Now, that's not saying I still didn't laugh at a few scenes, though surprisingly not about the Grandmother or Windex® – maybe that was the shock value back then, and I still feel it is charming, it just now feels like to me an extremely annoying family meets another stereotypical and blind to other cultures family.The story is simple: ""aging"" Toula is tired of her extended and meddling family and (literally, more than once) falls for a 90s stand-in good-guy reject. The object of her obsession is not Greek, like her family wants her to court, and is plainly, a one-note nice guy who's tired of all the same ole women. To spoil that they're gonna get married is fruitless due to the title, but the real spoiler is that no one's really fat. I suppose they're equating ""fat"" with ""a lot"" as in how many family members there are. OK, granted, the dad has some extra pounds and our heroine, Toula, isn't in the best of shape, but the word ""fat"" probably shouldn't have been used.Again, the movie is charming. It's harmless and cute. Plus it does have some genuine insight and the family, unbelievably, due to their annoying behavior, grows on you. So it's a recommendation.Now, as for the sequel I'm about to watchwellI will be disappointed if, 14 years later, Toula isn't actually fat. Now that, I would laugh at.***Final thoughts: What a fall from grace. I didn't write a review on this movie 14 years ago, the only time I've seen it, but I distinctly remember granting it 5/5 stars and thought it was one of the funniest movies I had seen.

23,paul2001sw-1,Fun and universal,8,10 February 2008,"In some respect, first generation immigrants are the same everywhere: loud, brash, nostalgically sentimental, attaching great importance to family and community; and for reasons that it doesn't exactly take a degree in sociology to fathom. Then the second, more assimilated generation grows up, and naturally, there are conflicts. This subject has been often addressed in the movies, but rarely with more brio than in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', a low-budget film which proved a surprise hit, probably because it's almost impossible to dislike. There's not much plot, but a lot of shrewdly humorous moments, and while it relies on clichés, it also emits a feeling of truthfulness. For example, the wedding speech is funny in the way that real wedding speeches are funny, because it combines a modicum of humour with an unprofessional delivery that almost kills the joke but which actually makes it more funny. And it's a pleasant surprise to see a romantic comedy featuring ordinary looking people. In conclusion: it's great fun, and real to boot; it deserves its success.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
24,MOscarbradley,Light as air and very likable,7,4 April 2007,"This slight little movie, (not a great deal happens in it), has nevertheless considerable charm. It's about an ugly duckling who becomes a swan and gets herself a handsome WASP prince into the bargain and it has, at its very large heart, a lovely comedienne called Nia Vardalos who not only stars but adapted the film from her own seemingly autobiographical one-woman show. It's the kind of film you find yourself constantly smiling through and when you laugh out loud it's at gags that aren't really gags at all but just little bits of business that happen to be funny.Vardalos and her director, Joel Zwick, are canny enough not to over-egg the pudding. They keep it light and it rises almost in spite of itself. It ought not to work, (I mean, this kind of fairy-tale went out with the Ark, right?), yet it does despite Vardalos' inexperience in structuring scenes dramatically, (the material just seems to evolve naturally), and Zwick's somewhat obvious approach to it.As the object of Vardalos' affections, John Corbett has very little to do except look handsome although thankfully he plays down the cuteness factor and he has an easy-going likability while Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan are marvellous as Vardalos' OTT Greek parents. They both manage to find the beating heart of the couple inside what are basically caricatured roles. In fact the whole cast rise to the occasion; there isn't a dud performance in sight.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
25,dromasca,"Greek Salad, Salt Missing",6,21 October 2002,"I was not amazed that this film was well received by US critics and audiences. It touches a sensitive subject for the American (and any immigrant society) - inter-marriage, and it does it as a comedy at human scale. What is new to American audiences is well known for movie fans all over the globe - real human emotions can be good film material, even better than comics or gangster stories. The problem is that all is so expected, I could even predict gags after the first two minutes of the film.
The director never did a big screen movie, just episodes of TV shows like 'Love Boat'. The result can be seen - characters never get deeper than the stereotype, and he really has trouble making something happen in this 90 minutes screen. Acting is good, but it reminds so much TV that I kept hearing the background laughs as in TV comedy series. If you really want to see a good ethnic inter-marriage film better pick 'Mississippi-Massala'. 'Greek Wedding' is a missed opportunity to do a similar film more on the comic side. 6/10 on my personal scale.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It seemed to be making a ton of money and it must have set some record of some sort. It did, but I'm sad to say that it was the record for highest grossing movie to never hit #1 at the box office. I still enjoyed this. The plot's very basic, with a Greek American wanting to marry a non Greek American. I don't know where the fat part in the title came from.The funniest part was when she got a pimple and her dad said Windex would help. Her fiancée later says it actually did help him! The movie isn't a masterpiece, but it is very sweet and cute. I really did like the pacing and how he proposed to her halfway through the movie.

The script is tight, yes, but the performance of Ms. Vardalos is even tighter.Have seen the film three times now and each time I marvel at how precise her comic timing is, her asides, her micro-expressions.

This family movie with only one known actor, Michael Constantine, was deliciously funny and riveting in its use of cultural symbols and stereotypes to highlight mostly the good points in humorous ways about cultural clashes. There are some somber moments and there are some hilarious scenes, all wrapped up in the sensitive portrait of the not some glamorous woman with a bunch of pent up vitality and inner charm that wait to burst out into the open. This movie brings out the good in everyone and a movie that lights up, penetrating the underbelly of Greek-ism, and touching our hearts like a nice warm serving of mother's baklava. One of the best movies of the year.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
30,paulclaassen,One of the most original and naturally funny comedies.,8,1 July 2018,"Finally a comedy that is naturally funny! I loved every minute of this delightful, hilarious comedy. The blend of culture and nationality was wonderful, the dialogue and plot great, and the acting fantastically realistic. Andrea Martin in particular was sensational as Aunt Voula.

31,redryan64,"This Greek Wedding Scores Like A League of Nations in Real, Old Fashioned , Belly Laughs!",10,25 June 2007,"It started with a one woman show, essentially an expanded Stand Up Comic's Routine. It was full of some of the little idiosyncrasies that exist in all of us. Add a pinch of hyperbole, and PRESTO! You've got a hit.As we recall there was no big ballyhoo campaign for this film. It simply got itself released and on a relatively few screens nation wide. Then, just like a Neuculear Chain Reaction, everybody was talking about it. The old word of mouth method of spreading news of a good thing still ranks up at the top of the list.It is simply, a love story or a story about sex, they always get our interest. No, not explicit scenes of naked-leave-nothing-to-the Imagination scenes that we have come to being used to see in our 'Cinematic Arts'. But the story of a sort of bashful, shy, young woman who hasn't had much of a social life, feeling that it is at least in part to her family's clinging to the ways of the ""Old Country"", in this case being Greece.Though the story involves peculiarities of families of Greek ethnicity, we all know that all of our peoples have theirs. We could all have written our ethnic family stories and have it made into a successful, little romantic comedy. The big difference is we did not do it. Nia Vardalos did.Adding to the fine story line is a great cast. In particular, we have Lanie Kazan and Michael Constantine as her parents. John Corbet as Ian Miller, her Fiancée and Fiona Reid and Bruce Gray' playing his folks' make up about as Waspy a Family seen on the screen in many a moon.Of all the players in this picture, it was great to see Michael Constantine in such a great featured part. We have been watching his talents on the screen for many a year now. Let's hope we'll have him in many more.MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING was not big budgeted, certainly no blockbuster. It did not boast of any top Box Office Movie Star Types. The story is a sort of tale of everyman. In this case the family is Greek, in my case it would be Irish, but whatever the ethnicity is not important. It is a gentle, loving look at a common 0pccurrence to all of us. We can all laugh and see a little of ourselves. Just imagine, a common everyday type incident, with basically working class characters. And to think, this was tops at the Box Office! Hey Hollywood, there's a lesson to be learned here!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

One girl trying to break free of the smothering love of a family falls in love with a non-Greek and breaks all the molds.I recommend for the entire family to see this movie and I believe it to be an instant classic.

36,Chris_Docker,It loves itself so much you may find it easier to love than hate,7,13 October 2002,"(6/10) Don't be put off by the trailer  this movie is actually quite funny. Funny in a formulaic, TV-sitcom sort of way. It gives us a life-segment of a dowdy 30yr old Greek woman in America who puts on a bit of make-up and attracts a hunky American, makes him Greek' and marries him. End of story. Much of the material is drawn from a one-woman comedy show, which in turn was drawn from her own life experiences. The Greek' gags don't come over well in the trailer perhaps because it is only when we are immersed in the Greekness of the characters, and the stark contrast with American attitudes, that we can see the humour in the situations. The movie has lots of sentimental self-caricature, a big wedding, and all the other elements for a popular Saturday night laugh. Nothing deep, except perhaps that the caricatures give some insight into the large Greek community in many western countries that tends to keep itself to itself and so remain something, sadly, of a mystery to outsiders.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

When (John Corbett) and Toula (Nia Vardalos) met, I felt really warm and tingly. If you ask me, the way they met was really romantic. I didn't like the glasses Toula was wearing at the beginning of the film, though. In other words, I was really glad when she got contact lenses. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, funny, and charming romantic comedy to any John Corbett or Nia Vardalos fan who hasn't seen it.

The great success that this film received is very well deserved! I love this movie for many different reasons, one big one is the superb writing. The very original screenplay that was written for my big fat Greek wedding is hilarious, heart warming, cute, romantic, and very smart. I love John Corbett and Nia Vardalos here, their chemistry on screen together as a couple is awesome, it looks so authentic and they really convince the whole audience that they really do love each other and want nothing else than to be together, to be married. The rest of the family is great too! The cast has really hysterical lines of dialogue that they share amongst one another, and then there are scenes of true love, both romantic and love amongst family members. Tula's brothers, Nick being one of them, are great characters and they make for some funny scenes. The other characters, like aunt Voula, is very hilarious all throughout the movie! 9/10 for my big fat Greek wedding! Go and have some fun.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It's a dime a dozen story, in this case about leading lady Nia Vardalos' true-life Greek family and all their supposed eccentricities. Big Deal. There is nothing out of the ordinary here, precious little that's funny, and anyone out there with a large family of their own will undoubtedly have just as many, if not more, zany characters in their personal tree on which to base a much funnier full-length feature. I mean, what makes Vardalos so special? Just because she actually took the time to sit down and ""write"" about it? Jeez -- I could clean up in that business with my own family stories and make a billion dollars! You got a couple of hours...?

It is not an extremely good film but it just doesn't go wrong anywhere. The story is simple. Toula, played by Nia Vardalos, is 30 years old and still single. Her family is Greek so she must marry a Greek. Unfortunately for her family she falls in love with Ian Miller (John Corbett), definitely not a Greek. He falls in love with her too and so the only thing in the way is family.The people in the movie are all nice people in their own way. Although Toula doesn't like her family is Greek in every single way, and is too proud of it, she does love her family.'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is a very enjoyable film, with a lot of funny moments.

43,vertigo_14,A simple story about a girl in love.,8,11 April 2004,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a very simple, funny romance story that would probably be most appreciated by female audiences. Nia Vardalos (the film's writer and star) is Toula Portokalos, a quiet young woman from a zany Greek family. As she explains in the great flashback introduction, all her life she has been brought up to be strictly Greek. But, the same upbringing also contains some traditional absuridites that she can't understand, although her parent's wish that she would adhere to. Toula's upbringing has only allowed her to look forward to one thing at this point in her life: get married to a nice Greek boy and have lots of babies.
This is not something Toula wants to here, and eventually, she gains the courage to break out of her introverted shield and gradually change herself into a bold, lovely woman. She stops working at her family's resturaunts and starts taking computer classes at the local college, which lead her not only to a better appreciation for herself, but leads to a job at her aunt's travel agency where she meets Ian Miller (Jon Corbet), and that is where our story begins.Toula and Ian are in love, really very much so. But, this troubles Toula's mother and father, with her father (Michael Constantine) being more strict in traditional Greek upbringing than her mother (Lanie Kazan), when Ian proposes to Toula. For Toula's father, it is bad enough that she quit the family business to go to school and everything. But it is simply out of the question for him that she marry a non-Greek. So, Toula is torn between the two. This is a movie very much in the spirit of films like Bend it Like Beckham and somewhat like the Joy Luck Club in addressing roles of tradition in future generations of immigrants and the possibility and reason for preservation of such traditions.Of course the film is a very simple movie, a simple love story, but a funny one nonetheless. We see the contrast between Toula's Greek upbringing, and Ian's very quiet, conservative family. Everyone was fantastic in this film, especially Lainie Kazan as Toula's mom, Michael Constantine as her father, and the wonderfully hilarious Andrea Martin as Toula's Aunt Voula.I don't know the reason for so many negative reviews for this movie. I would say it was probably the best movie I saw in 2002, and one that I have seen many times since just because it a lovely little (and funny) story about a girl in love.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

When I originally saw this, in the theatre, I laughed my head off. It's a very funny movie and I can understand why it became a surprise hit.But that said, it was a bit overrated(making a TV SHOW OUT OF IT? WHY????)That was taking it a bit far. This movie is great the first time around. It is genuinely funny and it'll leave you feeling good. But it didn't hold up to repeated viewings for me. I have tried to watch it again since and been a bit bored. I do think it deserved all the good things said about it. There are some absolutely great moments of comedy in it.

All the characters are pretty well drawn out and a lot of recognizable actors appear to make it even more pleasant.

Instead I got a mildly amusing movie with an occasional guffaw moment thrown in for good measure.In reality, though the movie could never live up to its hype. Or maybe I just don't find racial stereotyping particularly funny. And how many times can you laugh at the Windex joke, or the ""this word has a Greek origin"" line?In fact, I found myself wondering why, if this family was SO Greek, and loved the Greek culture SO much, why they weren't living in Greece.The funniest part of this film, for me, were the opening scenes, with the narrative talk-over. After that, it was amusing, but little more than a harmless feel-good movie that left me feeling like there should've been more to it due to the hype.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Besides, her traditional Greek family don't let her have many opportunities besides the ones that are about the Greek tradition.

It takes the rom-com model and applies it to Greek culture in a charming and informative way. While it has clichés of quirky side characters and such, it's done with such charisma that it's endearing enough to work in a unique way. The humour works, you come to care for the characters and it's edited with a Scorsese-like pace. I wish there wasn't such a distinct lack of conflict in the last act as it's almost as if the filmmakers couldn't bear to take their characters to the true crisis point and it ends not as satisfying as it could've been.

This is racism, because one really is supposed to laugh at these ridiculous people. It is impossible to make such a movie anymore about black people, but it seems to be all right about Greeks.

51,MartianOctocretr5,"Predictable comedy, but fun anyway",8,23 August 2006,"Greek Wedding is a fun movie, even though it's very predictable. The culture clash jokes are nothing new, but writer and star Nia Vardalos has put some wildly crazy and humorous slants to the routine.Toula Portokalos (Vardalos) is a 30-something who finally meets the guy of her dreams, but he's not the Greek ideal her family wants. When he encounters her folks, the poor guy is bombarded with medicinal Windex, Greek linguistic lectures, rants about Turkish invaders, and other madness. Most of the comedy material is focused on them, so other characters (including Ian) are not developed as much.The love story is a little sketchy, but has some moments (the progressively passionate good-night kisses are cute). Ian (John Corbett) is an amiable and likable guy, and Ian's mellow parents are a perfect oppositional counterbalance to the Portokalos clan, being as ""dry"" as the latter is loud and gregarious. They play the shocked reactions to this wacky family with comic brilliance. One of the best scenes is when the parents of the couple first meet at a party; the respective parents' divergent personalities collide with dazzling insanity.Michael Constantine as Toula's elitist father, Andrea Martin as her zany aunt, and Lainie Kazan as her warm-hearted mother are outstanding in their roles.

I felt I was at the wedding when it finally happened. The love story is gentle and fun and Nia is glorious and so real. Every 30 year old woman criticised by her family for not finding HIM can relate to her. Nia blossoms, not because she has a man but because she wants to break the mould of where her father sees her, as a hostess in his restaurant until she can find herself a husband.  Once she breaks this mould, she is on her way, her self esteem goes up along with a position in travel agency and then she meets him, or rather he makes a point of meeting her.  Then the fun begins as he tries to assimilate into her huge extended family. There are so many sidebits in this also, reminiscent of ""Four weddings and a funeral"".the grandmother is a hoot with her cursing and running away, the rough and tumble relationship that her brother has with his nephews.

Very cute love story, all done before in one way or another with some ethnic group but pleasant nonetheless.

55,gftbiloxi,Amusing But Extremely Slight,7,18 April 2005,"There is a lot to like about MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING, a well-made romantic comedy that presents the story of Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), a young Chicago woman of Greek ethnicity who must overcome family opposition when she decides to marry an upscale yuppie WASP. The cast is expert; there are quite a few belly-laughs and chuckles aplenty; and the script is witty and plays with stereotypes without ever descending to mean-spiritedness. But perhaps the single most likable thing about Greek WEDDING is the fact that the romantic leads look like real people instead of the Ken and Barbie actors so typically found in this sort of romantic comedy. That is indeed a real joy, and I suspect it is at the heart of what has drawn so many to the film.I do indeed indeed recommend MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING. But I also offer a slight caution: unless you are a die-hard romantic comedy fan, you might do better to rent the film before you actually go to the expense of purchasing it. It is expertly done; it is charming; and I certainly look forward to seeing more from Nia Vardalos in the future. But all that said, I found Greek WEDDING extremely slight, and do not think I will revisit it in the future. I found it enjoyable for an evening, but nothing more. The DVD package, by the way, is as slight as the film. There is extremely little in the way of bonus material, and if your decision re VHS vs. DVD rests on bonus material I would suggest you purchase the VHS; you will miss nothing in terms of extras.Gary F.

56,jhclues,You're Invited to Join in the Celebration!,10,4 September 2002,"This film is a celebration of life steeped in tradition, family, love and just the joy of living; and it invites you to come in and participate in that celebration, rather than leaving you on the outside looking in, as it were, merely as an observer.  A film that seemingly welcomes and passionately embraces all that is good and worthwhile in the world, `My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' directed by Joel Zwick, will make you laugh and make you cry, but most importantly, it will make you `feel.'  It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that afterwards makes the sky seem bluer, your step a bit lighter and a smile easier to come by; and when a film can do all of that, you know you've come across a bona fide treasure that you're going to hang onto for a long, long time in your memory. Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) is thirty years old, lives with her parents in Chicago and works in the family restaurant, `Dancing Zorbas.'  Every facet of her life is imbued with all things `Greek,' and by proclamation long since issued by her father, Gus (Michael Constantine), Toula is bound by all that is `holy' (read:  `Greek') to marry a Greek, live a Greek life and bear many Greek children.  For her to even think of doing otherwise would be unfathomable, unthinkable, unimaginable and, well...'UN-Greek.' So it becomes something of a conundrum for Toula when she meets and becomes interested in a man named Ian Miller (John Corbett), a guy who is decidedly NOT Greek in any way, shape or form.  But he asks her out, and one thing leads to another and then another, but before Toula will allow things to get seriously out of hand, meaning `serious,' she knows she must run up the flag, take a deep breath and tell her father.  And for Toula, it just may be the hardest thing she's ever had to do in her life.  Ian, meanwhile, is about to experience culture shock, as he is about to be confronted by a family that includes, for example, twenty-seven first cousins, something Ian isn't quite used to; after all, he has `two' of his own, and they live in another state. The screenplay was written by star Nia Vardalos, adapted from her own one-woman show, and it fell into capable hands when she turned it over to director Joel Zwick, who picks up the rhythms and the `sense' of the story without missing a beat.  Falling into step with his star, Zwick crafts and delivers a film that is totally immersed in the zest and zeal of living. Under his astute tutelage, the viewer becomes a part of Toula's life, sharing that grand heritage of which Gus is so proud.  He brings the story and the characters to life with detail and nuance, and in such a way that your senses will kick into full throttle.  The images he creates are so vivid, and it's such an engaging presentation, that the vitality he generates is almost tangible, and you can smell the lamb and all of those Greek delicacies cooking in the kitchen.  And Zwick sets it all in motion by establishing a pace that will sweep you along with the story; a carousel ride that will keep you involved and smiling all the way to the end.Nia Vardalos certainly captures the essence of all that is `Greek' with her story, and with her affecting performance as Toula.  This is a young woman you get attached to very quickly; there's something of Benny, from `Circle of Friends' about her, as well as Muriel, from `Muriel's Wedding.'  It's a character your heart goes out to immediately, one to whom you wish all good things will come.  There is an introspection to her portrayal that contrasts effectively with her vigorously outgoing environment, and it makes her presence all the more dominating and singular.  And it's actually in the reserve Vardalos exhibits in her character that the viewer finds the way inside to Toula's deepest longings and emotions.  Without question, this is a complex individual, in whom we find not only the strength necessary to maintain autonomy (which she manages to do within the greater structure of her family), but vulnerability born of the respect she demonstrates toward her father, her family and the traditions they so lovingly serve.  It is this very complexity, in fact, that elicits the necessary empathy of the audience, enabling that vital connection between the viewer and Toula.  And Nia Vardalos IS Toula, from the ground up and from the inside out. Moreover, one would be hard put to discern any distinction whatsoever between the actor and her character, as her performance is entirely natural and genuine. As Toula's mother, Maria, Lainie Kazan is a delight.  The character she creates is totally credible, and she's just a joy to watch.  And the same can be said of Andrea Martin's performance as Aunt Voula.  This is a VERY Greek woman who is boisterous, overtly self-assured, opinionated and dominant; and she will win you over in an instant.  It is Maria and Voula that add some real spice to the film, and when you add in Gia Carides (who plays Nikki) to the mix, you've got a Greek feast fit for the gods. Of all the actors in this wonderful cast, however, the one who absolutely steals `My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' is Michael Constantine, who has the role of his career in Gus, and without question, makes the most of it.  From his overabundance of Greek pride to his many and varied personal peccadilloes (like his ever-present bottle of Windex, which he is convinced can cure everything from a minor scrape to the common cold), he simply gives the performance of a lifetime; and if there is any justice in the whole `Greek' world, Constantine-- and this film-- will be duly remembered at Oscar time. It's the magic of the movies.  10/10.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It took about three months for the good word about the film to get out on the street. I presume that there must be other, equally well made independent films out there at any given time. But these seem to be given only two or three weeks to make it theatrically, then its off to DVD-land or the Sundance Channel. From what I understand, it wasn't even the distributors who pushed this movie, but Greek-American organizations, notably local Greek Orthodox churches. It makes you wonder what the distributors are thinking.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
58,rps-2,Toronto Illinois,8,11 February 2003,"I was amazed at the number of negative comments posted. This is a funny, wholesome, clever and very good movie that touches the heart, the soul and the funny bone. But why is it set in Chicago but (ssssh!!) shot in Toronto. It's based on the real story of a Greek Canadian. The culture clash that forms the basis of the story is very familiar in Toronto with its huge multi cultural population. One of those large ethnic groups is Greek. Indeed much of the picture takes place on ""The Danforth"" which is the main street of the Greek community. The movie was a hit. Would it have been any less a hit had it been set in Toronto rather than Chicago?",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Yet it is devoid of any surprise, suspense, or a sense that anything is at stake. It was the fifth highest grossing movie of 2002 in the USA, and the highest-grossing romantic comedy in history.

61,dave-mcclain,The highest-grossing romantic comedy and one of the most satisfying comedies ever made!,10,24 March 2016,"In the spring of 2002, I went to see a romantic comedy about which I had heard very little. The movie's lack of advertising made it seem like it wasn't a very big deal and its focus on an ethnic heritage that was not my own made me think that I might have trouble relating to the story. I couldn't have been more wrong. Before the opening credits were over, I decided that I would buy the movie's DVD when it came out. The reason that I'm relating my personal experience seeing this particular film is that I believe it matches the experiences of many other Movie Fans who saw ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (PG, 1:35).The film originated as a one-woman stage show in which actress and Second City alum Nia Vardalos entertained audiences with her take on growing up in a Greek family and then marrying a non-Greek. Actress Rita Wilson saw the play and suggested that her husband, Tom Hanks, create a film version through his production company, Playtone Entertainment. The result was a $5 million movie that became a sleeper hit, earning $368.7 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy – and one of the most profitable films ever.Surprisingly, the film never topped an individual weekend box office, but its slow build, aided by strong word of mouth, resulted in the movie being in U.S. theaters for 52 weeks, over half of that time in wide release. Vardalos received an Oscar nomination for her screenplay and acting nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press (the Golden Globes) and the Screen Actors Guild. Unfortunately, she didn't win any of those awards, but Movie Fans won big, having been blessed with this wonderful comedic gem.Fotoula ""Toula"" Portokalos (Vardalos) is a single 30-year-old American born to a large, proud, loud, tightly-knit Greek family in which she feels smothered and trapped. She works as a hostess at Dancing Zorba's, the Greek Restaurant owned by her father (Michael Constantine) and mother (Lainie Kazan) in Chicago. Toula lives in an obnoxiously Greek-looking suburban home with her parents, grandmother (Bess Meisler) and younger brother, Nick (Louis Mandylor), who works as a cook at Dancing Zorba's.Toula's sassy older sister, Athena (Stavroula Logothettis) has married a Greek boy and made Greek babies, as Toula's voice-over tells us she is also expected to do, but Toula wants something more out of life. With her traditional, but sympathetic mother's help, Toula's stubborn father agrees to let her take some courses at a local college. She builds on her earlier success in high school computer classes and ends up going to work at the travel agency owned by her Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) and Uncle Taki (Gerry Mendicino). As she expands her horizons, Toula starts paying more attention to her appearance, becomes more social and gains confidence but all that is only the beginning of her transformation.In her various jobs, Toula keeps running into tall, handsome local high school teacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett). Ian has tired of the string of ordinary women that his best friend, Mike (Ian Gomez, Vardalos' real-life husband) sets him up with, and he finds Toula to be refreshingly different. Toula keeps her budding romance a secret from her family until her meddling Cousin Nikki (Gia Carides) comes to tell her ""the family knows."" What follows is a series of humorous scenes in which Ian works to gain the acceptance of Toula's family, is repeatedly hazed by her brother and their Cousin Angelo (Joey Fatone), and tries to help his very reserved, upper middle class WASPy parents (Bruce Gray and Fiona Reed) to get to know Toula's extremely outgoing ""very Greek"" family. Of course, given this movie's title, it's obvious where the story goes from here, but this film is not about the destination. It's about the ride.""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" isn't just one of the best romantic comedies of all time, it is, in my not-so-humble opinion, one of the best comedies of all time, period. Of course, it all starts with Vardalos' brilliantly insightful and hilarious script. After watching this movie for the Nth time to refresh my memory before writing this review, I still found myself repeatedly laughing out loud. As the script's jokes make us laugh with a combination of ethnic humor and many simply funny situations, it also makes its unusual characters and plot very relatable. Who among us can't identify with ""weirdness"" in our family, the search for true love and acceptance and the desire to be ourselves and make the most of our lives? But the script is only one of many elements that makes this rich Greek meal so deliciously enjoyable to so many different kinds of people. After directing several highly successful television sitcoms, like ""Perfect Strangers"" and ""Family Matters"", Joel Zwick (no relation to Edward) helms this movie with a keen eye for comedy and a sensitive feel for the characters' emotions. He mines all situations for every conceivable laugh, but never lets us lose sight of Toula's journey, which is the beating heart of the story.Vardalos had offers to make her play into a movie before Wilson and Hanks came along, but the earlier prospective producers wanted to change much of the story and didn't want to cast her in the lead role. As a Movie Fan, I'm very thankful that she stood her ground and eventually signed with Playtone. She is a very talented comic actress and her presence in the lead brings an authenticity that makes the whole thing work. Meanwhile, equally authentic and funny is the wonderful cast of supporting players who are all perfect for their roles and represent ingredients I believe are essential to the movie's overall flavor.Consider ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" to be very highly recommended by this ""xeno"" Movie Fan.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

63,FilmOtaku,A ridiculous and horrid film,1,23 October 2003,"I've labored over how to express my intense hatred for this film.  `How can I hate this film?' many, many, MANY of you may ask.  My question is, `How could you even tolerate it??'  Whoever told Nia Vardalos that she could act should be spayed or neutered.  She apparently went to the Richard Gere School of acting which teaches one facial expression.  While his is `bland bemusement', hers is `bug-eyed shock'.  You know that a punch line is a'comin because her eyes will bug out as the wind up and then. the zaniness ensues.The writing is formulaic and trite, the characters one dimensional, and one basically comes out of the film with several basic truths:  1.) If you are Greek you are colorful, wacky and dynamic.  2.)  If you are not Greek, you are boring.  3.)  One who marries another who is of another ethnic background and religion will have no problem converting to said religion. Christ, I could go on, but I will just p*** myself off more thinking about this film again.  I've been trying to wipe it from my memory.Admittedly, I walked into this movie on the defensive as I have two friends who are Greek and basically demanded that I love it.  Therefore, I instantly wanted to hate it out of spite, but not being a complete ignoramus I gave it a chance.  No dice.  It was worse than I could ever have expected, even by the low standards I afford romantic comedies to begin with.  I want someone to invent a working time machine so I can go back in time and never see this film; or I want to have a sit-down with Nia Vardalos and demand two hours of my life back.  If there is a class action suit against this film, I want to be a part of it.  This movie is not `a delight', it is an abomination and a full-on assault on the intelligence of movie-goers nationwide.--Shelly",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
64,Atreyu_II,"We can ask ourselves: Canadian, American or Greek?",6,12 November 2011,"This film is like Canadian and American culture trying to combine with or fit in with Greek heritage and culture, even though the title can lead one to believe it's Greek. It's nothing special, but it's okay. There is some good and some bad. It is another romantic comedy, although to be fair this one has some originality.The story is predictable. A woman named Toula is facing a ""crisis of existence"". She feels like she is a loser and she is pressed by her family to do something out of her life. Her father, very proud of Greek culture, wants her to marry a Greek and ""make Greek babies"". Just when she thinks she'll never be able to be happy, her life takes another course. She changes her visual, uses make-up, gets a different kind of job and meets a non-Greek named Ian Miller and soon they fall in love. Their love only gets stronger with time, however her father doesn't accept their romance very well because the guy isn't Greek, although he gets over that in the ending - which, by the way, is a happy one.It's one of those movies good enough... for a one-time viewing. Otherwise it ain't much more than that, although I'd probably recommend it for greeks... who enjoy romantic comedies and for greeks... who still feel proud of their nationality and culture (if that's still possible, considering their current situation of crisis).",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It's the portrayal of growing up in an immigrant family steeped in tradition and bonding.The originality of showing a Greek immigrant family introduces a side of storytelling most aren't familiar with. Though some stereotypes are exagerrated, they are done with consideration and respect for the culture. I found the selection of real Greek actors and the use of the actual Greek language a tasteful choice.Nia Vardalos does an excellent job playing Toula Portokalos, an unhappy woman who turned 30 and is under pressure to get married. Toula's dilemma of supporting her family business while under pressure to get married is something audiences can sympathize with. Toula's transformational through the story is one that's both impressive and believable.Michael Constantine does a superb role as Toula's father, Gus Portokalos. There are times I am reminded of my own family by his portrayal of Gus, a father proud of his cultural backgrounds. Gus' good-natured but sometimes misplaced actions leave the audience laughing and loving him.And I can go on and on about the entire family. Everyone is to be loved in this film.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a lighthearted movie that almost anyone can join. Though it can seem a bit dated and insensitive in some parts, the spirit of the film is relatable for those who grew up in such families.4/5. Quotable, likable, and enjoyable.

The ugly duckling of a Greek family cannot find a husband despite her father's constant reminder that a woman's duty is to ""get married and make babies"" (and may I add...cook and eat lots of food!)The humour is liberally sprinkled throughout the film, not uproariously funny and for that matter, not particularly original.  Most of the film including the ending is predictable. Father is a great character and provides most of the humour in his belief that virtually everything has Greek origins.  His idea that a couple of squirts of ""Windex"" for most ailments and injuries is an effective and universal cure is quite funny and much used throughout the film.Father's world is turned upside down when his daughter announces that she has fallen in love with and intends to marry a non-Greek. Heaven forbid! What a calamity!  There are some funny and embarrassing moments for the groom-to be from the moment he is baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church and tries desperately to become one of the extensive family.There is a splendid emotionally charged scene on the wedding day when father finally accepts the young man.It's quite a nice family film with touches of advice and moments of wisdom about living your own life and doing your own thing.

Vardolos is a revelation in the role of Toulah...there is not a false note in her performance and she makes Toulah someone we have to care for instantly. John Corbett (Aidan on SEX AND THE CITY) makes a perfect Prince Charming and Lanie Kazan takes her patented Jewish mother turn and gives it a Greek accent as Toulah's mom.

Are Chicagoans of Greek descent really this ethnocentric and quirky? Maybe--- don't know any. Michael Constantine, who I recall really IS of Greek descent, does a wonderful job playing the eccentric, oddball patriarch of the supposed modern American family still clinging to their Greek heritage and Greek identity. The older the character, the stronger the Greekness, and the odder the contrast between Greek culture and American. Grandma, a recent import from Greece itself, is four feet tall, and still dresses in black like Catholic nuns used to dress. Naturally, as in all comedies like this, she is crazy as a bed bug. The movie's lead character, her 30 year-old spinster granddaughter, knows all the lingo and behaviors of being Grecian in Chicago, but evidently prefers the ""modern ways."" Every character makes an entrance; they never just show up in a room. Everyone is largely writ with behaviors that apparently signal Greekness to the audience. At times it's almost as if the audience stumbled into the waiting room for a casting director, waiting to audition for a Saturday Night Live ""Zorba"" parody.The super straight character played by John Corbett seemed nice enough. Corbett has a charm that should go further than it has in movie roles. The Corbett character's parents were funny, albeit a one-note gag that went on for 2 hours.Overall, it was fine. It was certainly better than the recent French import, ""Amelie."" ""Amelie"" was fine, too, but it was hailed as Received Art, drooled over by the cognoscenti wannabes, and spoken about in Hushed Tones. When in reality, it was a merely nice, pleasant piece of fluff. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" might succumb to a similar fate: Ethnic themes, non-traditional plot lines, and subtle-as-a-semi-truck casting MIGHT lead audiences to speak of this movie in Hushed Tones. Do a bit of hem-kissing. I heard a bit of that from fellow audience members as the movie was over and we were exiting the theater. That kind of b.s. might have been one of the things that did ""Amelie"" in at the Oscars. Not the movie's fault, of course, but there you are.

She's, so to speak, nerdy and shy, and we learn (from very funny flashbacks) that she was never liked and had to go to ""Greek School"". Her father Gus (Michael Constantine) wants her to marry (a Greek, of course) so she can carry on the family. She, first, has to find a boyfriend.Toula sees a man who's dining in her eatery and is flattered by him. She gets a makeover (she looks totally different) and goes to work in her family's travel agency, where he comes back and they soon start to date. Toula and Ian Miller (John Corbett) fall in love, and Ian asks Toula to marry him.Obviously, Gus and the rest of the family doesn't want that. But, they insist, and the rest of the movie is about Ian's (and his parents's) adaptions to Greek customs. The house where they lived is the funniest part of the picture. Sure, it's not a big-budget hit, but t's a very funny piece of work.N'Sync's Joey Fatone comes in (meaninglessly) as a cousin who ""teaches"" Ian some Greek. It's obvious that he was put in to attract pre-teen audiences. He was even credited in the ad! The characters were hard to keep track of, but in movies like this you need lots of them. And it didn't matter as long as you got the main few straight.Many running jokes, such as the house, grew old after a while, but others, like the Windex, were funny all the way through the ending (which was great, by the way).

I had definitely seen a lot of the members of this cast in other films as well, but I couldn't place them.  I thought it was a little odd that Joey Fatone, from N'SYNC is in this film, but he did a pretty good job and he didn't bug me too much.  I was really impressed with the actress (and writer), Nia Vardalos.

""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" arrived in late summer of 2002 and became a small surprise to a lot of people where they didn't expect a new romantic movie to enchant their lives.Based on her one woman play, Nia Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos, a woman of Greek heritage at age 30 who has no ambitions of getting married, having kids or following the rules of all Greek women. She's the ugly duckling in her family while her sisters and other relatives are pretty and have their own families.

78,bregund,My Big Fat Boring Romantic Comedy,1,24 March 2003,"This review contains spoilers.Word-of-mouth built this little film into a moneymaking powerhouse.  It's too bad that it's so easily forgettable.This type of film has been done many times before, and better I might add, most notably `Moonstruck', with the added bonus of Cher with big hair.  In the IMDB voting booth, I gave this movie a three because it isn't very original.  MBFGW's problems are listed below.In keeping with the Romantic Comedy Makers Guild, there are quirks-a-plenty for several characters.  Father has an affection for Windex, thinking that it can cure anything.  Grandma, looking like the black plague, is crazy and doesn't recognize her own family until the all-important touching scenes. The problem with this film is that the characterizations don't run deep enough; we're only given surface details with no background whatsoever. The father's windex thing, for example:  why does he do it?  What circumstances brought the grandmother to the U.S. and why is she so loony?  Why did Vardalos go through a `frumpy period'?  And could the Millers be any more conveniently WASPy, thus allowing their assured warm-hearted transformation by the end of the film?Some things are outright silly:  Why would anyone roast meat on their front lawn?  Family get-togethers are usually held in the back yard for privacy. And who doesn't know what a bundt cake is?  Surely the family are not so insulated that they don't know what a bundt cake is.  She knows it's food, so why would she put a flower pot in the middle of it?  Why does Vardalos suddenly improve her image and go back to school?  And why would the father, obviously protective of his darling Toula, introduce her to a string of obvious losers by inviting them to dinner?All the film's faults might be overlooked if there were an ounce of romance between Vardalos and Corbett.  Vardalos's wide-eyed insecurity and Corbett's stone-faced expressions do nothing to make their romance believable. Corbett mumbles and squints his way through the film, playing the same character he always plays.  This film is about as romantic as a wet dishrag.In one of the film's few bright spots, it's wonderful to see Andrea Martin again.

It is so idiotic you have to have brain disease at an advanced stage to enjoy the ""jokes"" and the ""humor"" of it. And at least, if you are trying to portray Greeks, use Greek actors! For us in Greece it was ridiculous to see Americans trying (and obviously failing) to imitate Greeks in their speech, their dance and their movements. By the way you won't find a single family in Greece remotely resembling these comic figures (well perhaps in some really remote rural areas). And while I certainly know this has nothing to do with Greeks of Greece, I was told by quite a few people that it really strikes a Greek-American chord! We usually say here that people who left Greece during the 50s somehow froze their minds at this decade and carry with them this (non-existent nowadays) picture of Greece. This movie proves it.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
83,roghache,"Hilarious romantic culture clash, with empathetic heroine",9,11 March 2006,"An absolutely hilarious comedy, Grand Romance meets culture clash. My teenage son's friend (last name Papadopoulos) has a Greek born & reared father and a real wonderful little old Greek grandmother back in the Old Country. This particular Greek background family loved the movie, so it must ring true.Of course the story revolves around a shy 30 year old woman named Toula, trapped in her job at her Greek family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba's. She emerges from her shell to obtain a college diploma and start a new career as a travel agent. However, she really blossoms when she falls in love with a very unsuitable (according to her father) non-Greek WASP teacher named Ian. The story chronicles the culture clash as Toula must persuade her very traditional, opinionated father to accept Ian, and also introduce poor Ian to the Greek traditions and all her Big Fat Greek Family.Toula's blooming is remarkable (great actress in the role) and the very heart of the story. Many other women, including myself, will surely identify, having undergone somewhat of a lesser transformation themselves upon finding a man who appreciates them. Also, most everyone can relate to the unwelcome task of introducing the fiancé to some of the more 'challenging' kin we all have...the lazy, the crazy, or sometimes, even the downright nasty. As the saying goes, you can't choose your relatives...My favorite character is Toula's father, Gus. He makes this movie with his hilarious Windex obsession, his insistence that things be done HIS way. I often quote myself the famous head & neck comment regarding authority in marital relations! The best scene, in my opinion, is the 'performance' of the family ladies, who must attempt to convince Gus that it is HIS idea for Toula to work in her aunt's travel agency.Plenty of uproarious scenes though...the Greek pillars and statues of the family home, the BBQ spit on the front lawn, Aunt Voula's reaction to Ian's vegetarianism, the party held to introduce Ian's colorless & restrained parents to all the Greek kin (the bundt cake!), the brothers' teasing of Ian, the bantering barbs between the sister and her husband. Characters ALL amazingly well drawn. I love Aunt Voula!Wonderful Greek music! Made me feel like heading straight to the Mount Olympus Travel Agency myself and booking the first flight to Athens.My sole complaint is the baptism issue. Obviously, Ian's conversion to the Greek Orthodox Church held no religious significance for him, being done simply to appease his future Greek in-laws (not a great message). Even worse (though the screenwriters may have intended no malice), the kiddie pool. My husband is Roman Catholic, I'm Baptist, and I think you'll find most genuine Christians (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant) take baptism pretty seriously. Call me a fanatic, but I doubt I was the only viewer offended, and the writers could surely have found other material for their humor.That being said, it's a wonderful movie otherwise, and the closing scene priceless.

As for the pride and comedy ,100% correct, that kind of cruel and immature jokes are rare but when they come be aware everyone is a target. To the pride well, we are pompous loud and we have a problem with our temper, just kidding ,we have close to zero control of it ^__^.But when it comes to family matters ,you see this kind, emotional and lovable side in the film , yes there are fights inside ,but when puss comes to shove, we got each others backs.Overall it is good comedy ,with a lot of laugh and a nice inside look of a Greek family from a non-Greek, and the sequel is a piece a #$@$@!.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Vardalos, who also wrote the story, throws in an unusual mix of Greek humor and bizarre gags that don't gross the viewer out. My favorite one is when the Constantine character, Gus, says that Windex works on bumps, bruises, zits, etc.This movie reminded me how wild some of the wedding celebrations that I've attended in the past even though I'm not Greek.

89,hasosch,The Windex Principle,10,2 July 2009,"It may be capricious to point, in a commentary, to the more abstract problems that underlie a comedy, but since so many texts have already thoroughly evaluated the humorist part of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", let me restrict myself to what I call the Windex Principle.Like many immigrants whose names are difficult to pronounce for Americans, Kosta has transformed his name to Gus. However, this did not hold him back from giving his daughter a distinctive Greek first name: Toula, from Photoula ""the enlightened one"" (like Phot- in Photo). His house is a copy of the Parthenon temple, the garden is decorated by rebuilt antique statues, and on the house there is the Greek state flag, besides the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Portokalos never adjusted to his guest land. He speaks the American language, but with the characteristic Greek interferences, like ""this name is come from ..."". Strangely enough, his restaurant's name is called ""Dancing Zorba's"", which is mistaken insofar as the name of the Greek national hero is Alexis Zorbas (Tsormpás) and not ""Zorba"".For Kosta, there are two groups of people: the Greeks and the ones who would like to be Greeks. According to his very personal etymology, all words derive from Greek, and since Greece is (for him) the cradle of civilization, even the Japanese word Kimono does not make an exception. The only astonishing fact is that he speaks in his house English, apart from cursing. He has also conserved his patriarch ideas about women. It is out of question for him that his daughter marries a Greek and not a ""Xeno(s)"" (foreigner). When she meets the average American elementary school teacher Ian Miller, the hell breaks loose. And at last at this point, the movie shows that it is much more than very good entertainment. Ian cannot understand why Toula's family is so different. For him, there are only different ""backgrounds"". As a citizen of a state where there is practically the same American culture between Long Island and Los Angeles, between Montana and Mississippi, her talking makes no sense. He says that everybody has ""weird families"", and with that idea his horizon ends. On the other side, Kosta is sitting sleepless crying on his sofa because he interprets Toula's acquaintance as a personal attack. For Ian, speaking a foreign language is more or less a sign of non-adaption to a guest land (as even having an ""accent"" is), for Kosta his whole individuality depends on the different language: Greek is who speaks Greek. Ian cannot understand that in Europe you have to change the language when you just travel for 30 minutes by airplane, that another culture, people with other behavior and with quite different expectations await you when you leave your plane. America is widely homogeneous, Europe isn't. That being different is a reason for being proud and that this pride can sometimes manifest as particularism, is unknown to him - and if we see his parents and how he grew up, we are not astonished.This movie, taken seriously and not only as a nice comedy, could have gigantic implications: for example that American school kinds should be forced to learn at least one foreign language and that European history (and not only history of World War II) should be thought in schools like American history is taught in the schools of many European states. Perhaps this would help people like Kosta-Gus to integrate, if they would sense that there is at least a basic understanding of their differentness. As long as this has not changed, Gus' universal use of Windex stays as a symbol for his relations to his guest-land.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
90,Gubby-Allen,Not crap. But not funny either.,4,15 October 2002,"It's difficult to review this film. It wasn't awful, was full of likeable enough characters and was easy enough to follow.The problem is that the film is supposedly a comedy. In reality it isn't. Neither I, nor the bird I went with, laughed once. You count on one hand the times I even raised a slight snigger. The phone cord scene & the Nan getting caught by the sprinklers were the only occasions I can recall.The 'punt' / 'bun' / 'bunt' gag? (any ideas anyone?) When the mother in law to-be, turned up with a cake was it? went way over my head & the heads of most of the cinema by the looks of things. Even now, I've not a clue what was all about.Every other joke (playing tricks on the new language learner etc) have been flogged to death in the past. Infact the whole plot had. You could have substituted Greeks with Italians, Chinese, Indians, etc and had exactly the same ideas generated. This time of film has been done both seriously and humourously in every way possible.One reviewer below claims he/she has a Greek Wedding to go to on Saturday & now cannot wait for it. That is the problem with these sort of films, although, it's not the films themselves - they're just intended as lighthearted entertainment, but the people who watch them, leave the cinema genuinely under the assumption that all Greeks are like this. I worked in London offices with many Greek people, none of which were anything like this.It was compared to both Four Weddings & Notting Hill, but it isn't isn't in that league. The plot was far more formulaic & never really gave the cast any scope to be funny. That's a shame because as I said, they all acted really well, were a great set of characters are definitely the base of a good sound film. Unfortunately the person in charge of writing the jokes didn't fulfill his/her part of the bargain.A high 4/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

92,general-melchett,"Yawn, yawn, yawn...",3,31 August 2006,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is only original in the fact that all of the main characters are Greek (duh!), and that these Greeks have different superstitions, which cooks up a lot of problems in the film. But not even that can make this film good. It is a film that will cure all insomniacs of their burden. It's hardly even funny, and really does little to justify its existence. It really is just a sickly sweet romcom (if you can even call it that) for couples who wish to have a happy night in. But in reality, it is just a complete cowpat of a film, with no excitement whatsoever.This movie had all the makings to be great - Tom Hanks at the helm of producing it, an Oscar-nominated screenplay, an original idea - how this screwed up is beyond me. Perhaps because there wasn't much of a cast to go with it. If you want romantic comedy - you've come to the wrong place asking me.

It is a treat theses days to see a nice story about people that seem real (not plastic 100 pound Hollywood barbie dolls). There are so few romantic comedies made that are not rated PG13 or R.  My hope is that Hollywood is REALLY listening and will give more attention to movies that are a bit cleaner than some of the stuff that's been released lately.

Michael Constantine is one of the only bright spots in the movie, he gives the most entertaining performance in the movie.
The movie had a funny scene with the grooms family at the party but other than that most attempted humorous moments were lame. I cant believe this got a nomination for Original Screenplay.

96,TuckMN,It's all about family.,10,18 September 2002,"Love it, hate it or just accept it, we are all members of a family, be it large or small.Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the screenplay) is a member of a large extended family -- one that marries, makes babies and eats. That is after all the raison d'etre of a Greek family -- at least according to Ms Vardalos -- to breed and eat.There is an undeniable understatement of love in her big, fat, Greek family. In spite of how much they may make her uncomfortable (as an `Americanized' Greek) they -- and she -- share unconditional love. This is exemplified by her support of her brother in his search for a life outside the family restaurant business and her desire for a relationship with a xeno' (non-Greek or a foreigner to her father).John Corbett, in his best role yet, as the xeno,' is destined to fulfill both her needs and his. Their first meeting when she is still `slump girl' is a meeting that should go down in film history.Ms. Vardalos deserves an award for her transformation from `schlump' to royalty (ugly duckling to swan princess). Never before have I seen an actor transition from such an unattractive personality into a character with such beauty and grace. This is a near-flawless film: every character is brilliantly cast, the photography is evocative of an earlier age of filmmaking and the score is a treasure of sounds seldom heard by most audiences.The casting of Andrea Martin, Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine, and yes, even Joey Fatone (of the boy band NSync) is unparalleled genius.
The history behind how this film was produced and made is as fascinating as the film itself -- miracles do still happen in Hollywood.This is going to be the best film of this year because it tells a wonderful, honest story about people and their relationships to each other -- with a great deal of love and family values woven in to make it far above the norm. In other words... See It!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
97,len-21,7 on a scale of 10,7,26 August 2002,"I give this movie a 7 - begrudgingly. Every once in a while you go to a movie (comedy) and everyone laughs their ass off and you think to yourself, ""What exactly is so funny?"" Needless to say, this was one of those times for me. It is hard to say what percentage of the audience laughed their asses off because even if only 50% of them did, it would still be a lot of ass left in the seat. And, I did notice that a lot of people had baggy pants when they left. But, I assume that because this movie is the top grosser of the summer, and it had such little fanfare, that it must be nearly universally loved by audiences everywhere. In fact, that is the reason I was so eagerly anticipating it. The truth is I only laughed briefly a couple times and chuckled once or twice otherwise. I guess the fact that it was ethnic humor just didn't quite hit my funny bone.Ironically, one of my two favorite genres is romantic comedy. And, that is what this would be considered. In order for me to like this type of movie I only have two requirements: 1) Must be romantic and 2) Must be a comedy. Duh. Now, in order to be romantic, you truly must care about the characters. You must like them. If you like them, you enjoy seeing them happy. I didn't like them. She was bland (about a 3 on a scale of Meg Ryan's 10). And, he was little more than a stick figure thrown in to make the plot complete. In fact, the movie was less about them (romance) and more about them in relation her family.In order to be a comedy, you have to laugh. I didn't. I realize that most people did. I also accept the fact that it was very well done. Because of that, and only because of that, do I give it a 7. My time would have been much better spent staying home on that Saturday night and watching the first game of the season for the Nebraska Cornhuskers or the 3rd preseason game of the Chiefs or the running of the Bristol 400. In fact, I cannot think of a Saturday night that has ever had better sports. But, alas, I spent it with the family watching this movie.Ok, one more thought. My favorite movies are romantic comedies. I also do not like stand alone jokes. Too simplistic. I like situation comedy. However, earlier in the day, I heard a joke. Now, remember, I never laugh at jokes, but I love situation comedies. So, all the more interesting that I didn't laugh at the movie, but I laughed my ass off on the joke. Maybe because my ass was already laughed off before I went to the movie, I had nothing left to give.Two male neighbors were talking over a fence. One of the neighbors had a dog. The dog stopped running around and started licking himself. The neighbor said to the dog owner, ""Man, I wish I could do that!"", to which the dog owner replied, ""I don't know.

To be frank, the title did not draw me to the picture but the urgings of friends did and I certainly do not regret seeing it.  The film is not a ""large screen"" picture though and in some sections does smack a bit like TV sitcom.

104,SeriousJest,"Endearing chick flick, but beware the lurking stereotypes!",4,19 January 2012,"I watched this movie because more than one friend told me it was pretty goodthen, too late, I remembered that all of those friends were female. To be fair, the film is endearing, it's sometimes funny, and Vardalos has a Tina Fey-like quality about her–which I find attractive, although I'd much rather date Feyespecially if she's dressed up like Sarah Palinand if she wasn't marriedbut I digress. Also, Lainie Kazan is convincing as the eccentric, confident, loving, encouraging mother (although significantly more tame than in her You Don't Mess with the Zohan role). Plus, my good friend and Fraternity brother married a Greek woman (who he met while stationed in Greece; they had a Greek Orthodox wedding and everything!), and it was pretty cool seeing the movie reference the Greek cultural points that she taught me, like the toasts.On the other hand, this movie unfortunately follows that way-to-common formula of: ethnic girl who is embarrassed of her wild-and-crazy stereotypical family is swept off her feet by polite white boy from also-stereotypically uptight, rich family, and fireworks fly as the two families drive each other crazy while the couple struggles to ensure that their love prevails. In that sense, the film is not very creative: plug Greek stereotypes, language, sayings, and architecture into a Romeo-and-Juliet story, and you've got a movie that a bunch of Greeks (or people who are interested in Greek culture) will go see, because they're under-represented in movies, but then half of them will realize, too late, that the film is potentially reinforcing some dangerous stereotypes (granted, Vardalos wrote the screenplay, but stereotypes perpetuated by members of the same group aren't necessarily less dangerous).In any case, cynicism aside, this movie is a cutesy romantic comedy definitely a chick flick. If you are a woman who likes that sort of movie, you may enjoy this one, and it may be worth your time to sit down and watch it (although I wouldn't call it a must-seemaybe unless you're Greek, too). If you're a dude, pass on this one if you have a choice, but it's not exactly torture if you're forced to watch it, either.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
105,mweston,3 stars (out of 4),7,15 October 2002,"Fotoula Portokalos (who goes by the name Toula and is played in the film by Nia Vardalos) is Greek. She says in the voice-over narration that Greek women are supposed to marry a Greek man, have Greek babies, and feed everybody. She is 30 years old, single, and not even dating anyone, so she is *really* not living up to her parents' expectations. She is also somewhat unattractive, at least by typical Hollywood standards.She works in the family restaurant in Chicago, Dancing Zorba's, which comes complete with a lame neon dancing Greek character on the building. One day Ian Miller (John Corbett from ""Northern Exposure"") comes in, and Toula can't stop staring at him. He notices, more or less, but leaves without any meaningful connection being made.Some weeks or months later, Toula has made some changes in her life, and she sees Ian again. This time the attraction seems to be mutual, and after some minor difficulty, they start to date. But Toula knows it can't work. Ian is not Greek.Of course from the film's title you know that they at least try to find a way to work it out, but I won't give away much more. I will mention, however, that the parents are an important part of the film. Toula's parents are Gus (Michael Constantine from ""Room 222"") and Maria (Lainie Kazan). They are emotional and old fashioned and, of course, Greek. Ian's parents, on the other hand, are very repressed and more modern, and in general are the exact opposite of the Portokalos family.Nia Vardalos, the star, also wrote the screenplay for the film, based on her one woman play. Apparently Rita Wilson (who is part Greek) saw the play, brought her husband Tom Hanks to see it, and they helped get it made into a film, with both acting as producers on the film. *Interesting note*: Vardalos' real life husband is also named Ian, but he's Ian Gomez, who plays Ian Miller's friend Mike in the film.The film is very fun and very funny, most of the time. I think that the one woman play on which it is based was probably a bit more like a stand up comedy act than a true play, and that comes across in the film. The jokes are great, but the story that connects them is not as strong. And the film structure, camera work, etc. are pretty simple and straightforward, not adding much.

In the year 2003, it is the highest grossing and in my mind the best romantic comedy of all time.  The reasons are as follows (some spoilers contained within): (1) Nia Vardalos is a great actress and she had the best performance in the film.  She is really funny and really talented. (2) The film is deserving of the Original Screenplay Oscar it received.  The screenplay was tightly written and one can tell that much love and toil went into putting it together. (3) The introduction was one of the funniest I have ever seen. Nia Vardalos pulled the right notes of sarcasm as she introduced each member of her family. (4) Michael Constantine was awesome as the stubborn patriarch. (5) The funniest gag had John Corbett saying something bad in Greek when he was trying to say ""Thank you"". (6) Not only did this film skewer a few of the Greek stereotypes, it skewered a few of the stereotypes concerned with boring American families. (7) Every woman that has ever existed has manipulated some man in their lives and this film shows it exists in other ethnic groups. (8) The film didn't just deal with the marriage of the main character, it also dealt with the spreading of her wings and that was treated correctly. (9) The main message showed a normal-looking woman (who had some body fat on her) looking really good and being pursued by a guy who cared for her by more than just how she looked. This is the closest that a romantic comedy has come to actually portraying a real romantic relationship in my mind and I don't think it will ever come this close again. (10) This is a rare romantic comedy were that had at least one gay male character and I found that to be a bit refreshing.  It seems that every romantic comedy that I have seen the last five years has that aspect.Overall, I found this to be my favorite romantic comedy of all time mostly because it shyed away from the typical romantic comedy formula.  It also shows that women don't fall into that image that Hollywood has created that has been infested throughout our entire planet.  There is nothing with a woman being herself and maintaining a nice appearance even though she looks far from being a Hollywood starlet.  That is a moral message that should be sent to all young women out there.  I consider ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" to be the new standard that all new romantic comedies should be judged against. It is royally funny without being too disgusting and slanting into typical Hollywood trappings.  With the ten reasons stated above, this film receives a 10!  Here ends my rant!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
108,K-Slicer,I need an editor...,10,8 August 2003,"Sometimes when I write reviews for films, I write faster than I think and I leave out some key prose along the way. Here is what I really wanted to say: ""Greek Wedding"" deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar NOMINATION it received. The script is cleanly and sharply written and a lot of love was put into it.  The other correction is that it is refreshing to see a romantic comedy that DOESN'T have a gay character in it. Most of the romantic comedies I have seen in the last five years have this aspect (that doesn't mean that they all suck {I love Chasing Amy and My Best Friend's Wedding}) but it was a change of pace and that isn't always a bad thing. Those are my correction, so this is where my rants end.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
109,ian_harris,Must see if you are ethnic or have ever dated ethnic,8,18 October 2002,"This film is great fun - lots of laugh out loud material plus feel-good. Just stays the right side of cheesy at times - very cleverly.  This won't challenge your intellect but it might strain your sides at times, even old gags are repackaged beautifully, e.g. the wicked attempts by the Greek brother and his mates to embarrass and unnerve the unsuspecting fiancee. You don't have to be Greek to enjoy this movie - if you are ethnic of any kind or have ever dated ethic this film is a must see.  It reminded me a bit of Meet the Parents, which I also rate very highly.  Enjoy.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
110,jackjack-2,So-So Chick Flick,5,11 September 2003,"One of the most over rated chick flicks I have seen. After all the hoopla I was disappointed. The movie has no plot. The title gives it all away. Handsome prince meets frog and they get married but frog doesn't turn into a beautiful princess. And that is what is so unreal about the story.Tula, played by Nia Vardalos, is as butt ugly as they get and there is and there is nothing that can change that. Why would a handsome John Corbett even look at her much less date her? He is educated, she is not. They have nothing in common. She is about as sexy as a wet noodle. In fact the entire cast except for him is a bunch of fat ugly people. It is an insult to the Greek people because it leaves the impression with viewers that most if not all Greeks are fat and ugly, which is not true.The story is so predictable. There are no surprises. Perhaps the movie is only a fairy tale for fat ugly women and that is that in their dreams they will meet and marry a handsome prince and live happily ever after.
This is a ""feel good"" movie and viewers will feel good after watching it. That is about all that can be said for it.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
111,jvframe,"linear and predictable, low on laughs",3,5 July 2004,"Australia is the only country where the promoters played the line that `if you liked My Big Fat Greek Wedding, you'll love Mambo Italiano'. I loved Mambo Italiano so I rented a DVD of `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' expecting to at least like it. The only things they have in common are: reference to ethnic eccentricities (much more so in MBFGW); the expectations of parents for their children clash with reality; there is a wedding (80% of MBFGW vs. 5% of Mambo Italiano); and finally, the original concept was Canadian (MBFGW moves the locale to the USA, where the big bucks are, whereas Mambo Italiano stays on location in Montreal).  The stories are wildly different, but the most blatant distinction for me is that MBFGW has an absolutely linear and predictable plot, wastes lots of time with fluff and schmaltz, and has maybe two or three real laughs. Other negatives include paper thin characters, sloppy direction, average editing and a bloated script.One of the most disappointing films I've seen.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
112,marxsarx,It's a Cinderella tale...Greek style!,9,19 June 2003,"The first time I saw this monster box office hit at the theater, it was an obvious crowd pleaser.  I went back and saw it a second time with some friends and I laughed just as much.  Finally, I bought a used copy of the DVD so I could watch it again at home.  What do I have to say about this movie?It's just plain fun.  My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a Cinderella story of a mousy Greek girl who decides she wants to change things in her life.  And so she does.  The ugly duckling gets contacts, makeup, and new clothes.  She goes to college, changes jobs and gets a boyfriend.  One problem.  He's not Greek!  This definitely complicates things for Toula on the way to a new life.  This movie has  big comedy, tender family moments and a great cast.  My personal favorites were Toula's father (Michael Constantine) and mother (Lainie Kazan), although the movie belongs to its star Nia Vardalos and her movie beau, John Corbett.  The ensemble cast and the ring of truth in the story make it work.  It's definitely one of the top 10 movies of 2002 and a refreshing change from much of Hollywood's recent fare.  It may not be an Academy Award Winner or an attempt to be 100% authentic, but it is a fun movie to add to your collection.  I'd rate it 89/100.  It's better at the theater or on a big screen TV than on a small one because it's just a Big movie meant to be watched with a group.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
113,lingmeister,"A light hearted, if not so in depth look at cultural clash relationships",7,8 December 2002,"This movie is somewhat funny, poking fun at many of the traditional cultures that first generationers hold on so tightly.  Everyone who is not native to the US will somehow relate to the movie.  But the film does not go much below the poking fun at the surface to explore anything else.  Looking at the background of the movie, it could be easily explained since the story comes from a comedian's routine on her being Greek American.  Probably alot of one liners, material more suited for sitcoms.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
114,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 94,9,6 April 2016,"Boy, how well does this film holds up 14 years later. Can we finally admit to its greatness now?Whatever tropes it derives from the rom-coms of old serve only to make us feel comfortable in its grasp. But don't let the formula fool you. This film is anything but cloying. It opts out of cliché and sappy--instead, giving us rompy situations that we could actually see happening in our own lives. Toula, played by Nia Vardalos, who also wrote the film, is a 30-year-old woman whose family fears will become an eternal spinster. She doesn't seem to care about her appearance, and she is very awkward when it comes to talking to other people. She is of Greek origin, and her family won't let her forget it. They're the type who only talk to other Greek people. On the other hand, Toula doesn't care.She meets Ian (John Corbett), who isn't Greek. They fall in love and want to get married, but have to deal with the wrath of her family--mostly her father, played by Michael Constantine.The cast is perfect--especially Constantine, who we are often times convinced is Vardalos' actual father playing himself.The humor is mostly made of inside jokes from Greek culture. If you're not savvy on that, you might think you won't understand. But the script does an excellent job of not making us feel like an outsider. And most of us have families with weird traditions and tendencies, too, so we get it.There are a few lulls in the narrative, but the script always recovers well with something funny around the corner.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is truly funny in the most organic way possible. The scenarios all seem real. Vardalos is believable and hilarious in the lead role. She channels the sort of uninhibitedness that Lucille Ball was known for. Almost like a Kristen Wiig before her time.But most of all, this film speaks to generations of society who can't see past cultural differences. It was relevant back in 2002, and is still very much that way now. It's a tale we've been seeing, in one way or another, for centuries now, but still can't seem to get us to change our ways. Although no one's life is at stake in this film, we could all learn a thing or two from the story. It's deceptively deep. Twizard Rating: 94",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
115,japamo,My Big Fat Greek Wedding Laughs! :D :D :D,9,20 May 2002,"My name is John Panagopoulos.Yes, my last name is Greek and I am Greek, Greek Orthodox to be exact.Yeah, my name is long (many Greek surnames are quite longer), but not that hard to pronounce.Parse it into syllables and say it slowly....Pa - na - gop (hard g, like ""gus"")- ou - los.Now that wasn't so difficult was it?Like many other ethnic groups, Greeks have endured their slings and brickbats of outrageous prejudice, stereotyping, and even general indifference. I believe many consider Greeks the evolutionary equivalent of paramecia. But I am not here to bewail Greek ethnic suffering, but to praise ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", a movie I took my fairly conservative but reasonable Greek parents to see. I honestly confess I laughed uproariously and continually throughout the movie. To non-Greeks, Toula's Greek universe may seem cartoonish, surreal, and even outrageously ""sitcommy"". Perhaps, but the exaggeration is just a smidgen much. I assure you the Greek beliefs, mannerisms, characteristics, and ideosyncrasies the game cast manifests on the screen do exist indeed. Tia Vardalos manages to satirize, lampoon, and skewer a vast variety of Greek life elements. Yet, she is not vicious, mean-spirited, or self-loathing. For all the guffaws, frenetic pacing, and boisterous interaction of the huge cast, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" graciously and generously reveals the sweet heart and humanity of her extended exasperating family. As the cliché goes, I laughed a lot with recognition and cried a little with recognition.It is pointless to rehash the admittedly derivative plot: it's a pastiche (this is the Greek word for ""casserole"" by the way, as Toulas irascible father would say) of ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Father of the Bride"", ""Only the Lonely"" and every ""ugly duckling"", ""coming of age"", ""class warfare"" and ""crazy ethnic"" movie you can conceive. But who cares? The movie is achingly funny, people, for both Greeks and non-Greeks. I would recommend all families - ESPECIALLY Greek families- to see this hilarious farce. They will be pleasantly shocked by how true to Greek life it gets. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" serves as a concise but comprehensive primer to Greeks in general. If you're not careful, you may learn something about us kooky, overlooked Greeks.Not once was I bored with this treasure of a movie. No one is an irredeemable villain in this movie, not even the obvious target of the chauvinistic patriarch, who only really wants his family to be happy. Everybody is flawed, but everybody also has their worth. Each actor/actress in the film was an unfettered joy to behold, and contributes admirably to the overall effect of a wonderful slice of precious ethnicity.Apart from two anatomy jokes a couple of Greek cousins dupe Ian Miller, Toula's beau, into uttering in Greek, the movie is not profane, depraved, or crude. This is a family movie in every sense of the world.My commentary could easily extend into a surgical dissertation of every joke, character, plot device, and theme this celluloid cornucopia abundantly yields forth. But I will conclude with a paraphrasing of the theme the Greek patriach (Michael Constantine - a real Greek) hilariously and touchingly enunciates: The world is more than a melting pot. It is a fruit basket where apples (Millers) and oranges (Portokaloses) must and can happily live together with warmth, mutual respect, and happiness.You better believe I'll purchase this movie when it emerges on DVD!!!!!!!!!!P.S.: I almost forgot; my parents loved the movie too, though they're still a bit dismayed about Greeks marrying ""xeni (non-Greek stranger)"", though they admit that it is all but inevitable. In fact, my mom thought the ""xenos"" elements was even a bit dated; more and more, Greeks are marrying non-Greeks.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
116,pri_e,It flows...,8,17 December 2002,"I had been waiting to see this movie after hearing so many great reviews about it, finally my whole family decided to see it. It was hilarious right from the start as we follow Toula and Ian's (Nia Vardalos and John Corbett)relationship and wedding plans involving Toula's Greek family.
I think many cultures can relate to this story, as each has their own ideas about family and tradition. I felt that everyone in movie was fantastic, and I recommend it for anyone who wants a good laugh and maybe for their own families to have a wake up call!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Middle Greek daughter, Toula, is 30 and, as she says, ""beyond her expiration point.""  Her family is convinced they will have her on their hands forever.  Toula's father, Zorba, played excellently by Michael Constantine, wants her to stay working in the family restaurant.  That is until she meets the Ultimate WASP catch, Ian Miller, falls madly in love, and proceeds to change her life.Much of the humor concerns the clash of the bland, protestant, Ian's family and the boisterous, warm, eccentric Greek Toula's family.  The scene where Ian's parents come to meet Toula's parents is a classic.This is a funny film with many family-friendly messages.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
118,shaid,Nice movie but...,7,21 November 2002,"*May contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers*The bottom line is that My big Fat Greek Wedding is a nice movie. Yes I laughed and fairly enjoyed myself but its success has other explanations because if I want to be fair and speaking in cinematic terms, the movie is not so great. The script is thin and can hardly hold the whole film on its shoulders. The characters are one dimensional, nothing more than a caricature, with no development. To be honest the whole thing looks like a exercise that you give for a student during its studies for a degree in cinema. So why or how such a movie has grossed so far around 200 hundred million Dollars? The answer lie in the following elements:-1. The movie appeal to a lot of people. You can change the word Greek to Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Jewish or anything you want and it will still be the same movie. What more, anyone who watch the movie can recognize a familiar face. Meaning that characters can be replaced by someone we know. For example:The father is just like my father or I have an aunt just like that or I was in a similar wedding. By now you got the idea.2. I believe that this is one of the first movie that set the Greek immigrants as its center stage. We have seen a lot of films about the others ethnic groups, so this is new. That makes the film a more like an anthropological experience than anything else.3. This is quite a conservative film. Yes the heroine break the rules in order to get what she want but yet she choose to get married in the Greek traditional way to satisfy her father(she also convince her fiance to be baptized, to satisfy her father). In the end she confirms the important of cultural heritage and family values. Such a message appeals to the most conservative viewer.4. The fairy-tale element. The whole film is build as a fairy-tale. There is nothing more charming than a fairy-tale, especially if the fairy-tale ends with an happy ending. That was it. You can go to the film. You will probably enjoy it. As I said it is a nice movie.It is not the masterpiece everyone(or almost everyone)makes of it and I think no matter how you look at it it's much overrated. I hear some people have seen the movie more than once. For me once was enough.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Maybe this is a Greek movie for Greek people.On a side not. I have recently split with a long term partner and I, naively, have come to realise that love doesn't exist, maybe for your children, but these types of movies perpetuate, along with Disney knight in shining armour rubbish, the things we look for in romance. For god sake he wants to marry her and is in love with her in a very short period of time.... Real world = love bombing abuser :-)Sorry. Personally think this tomantic crap should now be banned as were setting up high expectations for all our children.

122,writerasfilmcritic,This Prince Charming Fairy Tale is Patently Absurd,2,19 January 2012,"If you possess a rather simple mind and delight in watching a ""happy"" love story that bears absolutely no resemblance to reality, then this flick's for you. Let's make one thing clear from the outset: Handsome men do not regularly fall head over heels in love with 30-year-old women who look like something the cat dragged in. OK, so ""Toola"" started taking a few classes, dispensing with the horn rims and the clothes that fit her like a potato sack. She began not only brushing her hair on occasion but styling it attractively. Still, she wasn't any great shakes, merely somewhat appealing, if a tad broad in the beam. For that flake to find himself wildly in love with her on the strength of a few long smooches, then to take her to his lair and suddenly decide he needed to marry her, was asking us to suspend disbelief just a bit too much too soon. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for her to find him in a clinch with another woman, but nothing of the kind transpired. You may recall that a mere half-hour into their first date, he was already asking her for a second dinner out, which I thought indicated something seriously wrong with him. Putting aside one's growing skepticism, for this guy (with nary a second thought) to throw over his well-meaning but nearly lifeless parents and his entire waspish background in order to party for the rest of his life with his intended's loud and obnoxious brood, seemed to be stretching credulity a little beyond anything reasonable. Sure, Greek food is quite tasty while Greek culture once formed the entire basis of Western Civilization, but these people jump around like circus performers and one must ask how many men would become baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church simply to please his prospective in-laws? Damn few, I suspect -- perhaps a guy who'd found the woman of his dreams and was so blinded by love that he didn't even consider the potential consequences.Providing one of the flick's few real chuckles, just before the impending wedding, ""Toola's"" aunt incredulously inquires of her fiancé, ""What do you mean, you don't eat meat!?"" For her, vegetarianism could not possibly be considered (and of course the spineless wimp instantly converts to a virile, meat-eating diet right on the spot). After the wedding, itself (which thankfully was briefer than expected), ""Toola's"" extremely skeptical and unhappy father suddenly does a complete about-face and blesses the union by handing the young couple the deed for a house of their very own. As they say, that's Hollywood.A few years down the pike, we are finally informed, ""Toola"" had gotten preggers immediately following the ceremony (not from their premarital dallying, of course) and they had a kid who is now six years old. She has miraculously retained her decent looks and everything remains upbeat and sunny. In fact, it turns out that the house pop gave them is right next door to mom and dad! In real life, you just know this troubled girl eventually would have reverted to looking less than glamorous and the guy would have become tired of her increasingly apathetic and depressing perspective. He'd probably have been off boffing anything that walked, or at least thinking about it, more sick of all this Greek crap than she was at the beginning of the movie. Following her hubby's first real trespass, her brother and cousin could have fixed his clock, as at one point they'd threatened, which might have formed the basis for a truly happy ending, at least in my book.I'd like to give this turkey a one, but since my wife adored it, the heroine was sort of sweet, and her aunt a somewhat interesting character, I'll give it a two just for their sakes.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Usually, I'm stubborn and watch a film to the end. Not so here.For starters, the stereotypes and the cheesy accents here are just awful. They didn't sound Greek to me; they sounded like Hollywood actors attempting to sound Greek. Also, John Corbett is a terrible actor. I'm sorry, he just is. The family was over-the-top, and I found my interest gradually decreasing as time went on.One thing that I did like in 'Wedding' was Nia Vardalos.

It touches many issues which could be of interest to virtually any human being, but even more so to someone who's familiar with Greek culture.

That we've seen the big, crazy, aggravating, ethnic family in America in so many other pictures is nothing new;  that this time they're Greek, maybe;  that its done with more love and less angst (somewhat;-) than has been beaten into our heads before, refreshing.I found myself wanting to marry the lead character.

131,annmason1,Something to Celebrate!,9,11 October 2010,"What a refreshing movie! The contrast between the WASP lifestyle and the Greek was very well done. I agree that most of us WASPs lead boring lives; certainly compared to the cultures that celebrate togetherness. To the Greeks, apparently, cohesion is more important than conformity. It fascinated me that, although these Greek characters were so connected,they were so distinctively unique. Ian was lost in this exuberance, but in love enough to be open to it; and to always fall for ""Nico's"" verbal jokes. Ian and Toula were different culturally, but their essence was the same; they were gentle people awash in worlds of too much isolation from feelings and too overwhelming in feelings. They both felt themselves odd balls in those worlds, and were magnetized to one another instantly. Of course, the most hilarious scene was when Ian tried to flirt outside Toula's office window and got ""an old lady ass kicking"" for his trouble. That, being followed by the scene where, in her entrancement with her new found soul mate, Toula flattens herself backwards! Those touches in the film that remind us of our own silly experiences are what made this movie so great for me. I loved the warmth of a culture so very different from my own; the realistic opposition that the father shows; the astonishment, but acceptance, by the ""toast"" parents of the groom.One of my favorite escape films.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
132,segacs,Side-splittingly hysterical,9,5 February 2005,"Hysterical. Absolutely, side-splittingly, laugh-so-hard-you-cry hysterical. That's the only way I can describe this movie. It had me, as well as everyone else in the theatre, rolling off their seats with laughter. And it's why, if you haven't yet seen this absolute gem, definitely make it your next night out.Written by Nia Vardalos, who also stars as the movie's main character, Toula, this is the story of a woman who falls in love. Only problem is, she's Greek and he's, well, not. At first, they conceal their relationship, but are eventually found out. The bonds of love, it seems, are strong enough to overcome Toula's family, and the couple decides to get married. Needless to say, Toula's family is less than amused, and Toula struggles with the guilt of being the first in the family to break tradition and marry a Xeno (foreigner). This, of course, leads to the requisite culture clash, tension, and opportunity for many, many gags. To say more would be to give away the funniest moments in the movie.Largely autobiographical, Greek Wedding falls in the category of movies that are so funny because they're so true. Sure, it's stereotypical and exaggerated, but that's what makes great comedy. You don't need to be Greek to relate to the mother who believes food is the answer to all life's woes, the protective older brothers, the large and wacky family get-togethers and customs - all of these are present in families from many ethnicities. I've heard comments ranging from the ""it's scary how much that's like my family"" to the ""someone put a video camera in my living room!"" This movie isn't perfect. The acting is more colourful than inspired, for the most part, with John Corbett's nice guy coming off as a little too good to be true, and most of the family stuck in two-dimensional character parts. The exceptions are Vardalos herself, and especially Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as her loving but quirky parents. Some of the humour is slightly too clichéd, and the requisite happy ending comes off a bit too neat.Despite this, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a movie-going experience that borders on being the best time you can have sitting up. So pour yourself a shot of uzo, sit back, and enjoy the laughter.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

135,paul-nemecek,"Wit, Words, and Windex",8,6 July 2018,"By the time this goes to press My Big Fat Greek Wedding will have set a box-office record for an independent film. The question that begs to be answered is why? There is no epic love story, no superhero, no psychiatrist-turned cannibal, and no guns-blazing action. So how did this low-budget independent film make its way to the top of the box-office heap? What is it that has audiences going back for more? I think it's because there is no epic love story, no superhero, no psychiatrist-turned cannibal, etc. That is, this could be about the family next door.I know, growing up in Chicago (where the movie is set), I lived next door to a Greek family, and dated a Greek-American girl who was afraid to tell her parents she was dating a non-Greek. This is the central problem in My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Nia Vardalos, the author of the play on which the movie is based, plays Toula Portokalos, a 30-year old ""seating hostess"" at the family restaurant. Toula is still single and this makes her a failure of sorts in the eyes of her extended family. The good news is that she falls in love and the guy loves her too. The bad news is that her new love is not Greek, and marrying a non-Greek is the only thing worse than being single.There's not much suspense in how this story ends. The title is a dead giveaway. But the real excitement and charm is in the telling. This film reminded me of two other romantic comedies, While You Were Sleeping and Return to Me. But this film manages the same humor and charm without resorting to plot devices like rescuing a man thrown on the train tracks or finding out that your new love has your dead wife's heart.Like those stories, much of the charm comes from the quirky family and friends. Michael Constantine is especially good as Toulah's father, a man who believes Windex can cure anything and all words are derived from Greek. Unlike those movies, this one has an air of plausibility. The characters seem like real people, and while the situations seem strange at points, they are close enough to possible that the viewer is easily caught up in the tale.In an era of special effects razzle-dazzle and movie spectaculars, I enjoyed this small film with a big heart. If you, like me, are bored with all of the formula films, give this one a chance. Just be sure to take some Windex in case you hurt yourself laughing.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
136,Old Crow-2,A delightful romantic comedy definitely worth all the hype,7,17 April 2003,"When I heard about the overwhelming success of Wedding in the States I didn´t really become interested in it at all. Though I like all kinds of comedies it didn´t really feel like a my kind of movie. But in January I saw the trailer a few times and it looked very promising. I decided to see the movie when it hit the theaters in Finland and I´m glad I did because this movie is very, very good.I won´t go to details, but in short Wedding is one of the best romantic comedies that has come out of Holly... Ooops, I guess we shouldn´t say Hollywood because this was an independent production. I guess those big studio executives thought that the whole thing about the Greeks wouldn´t interest the citizens of the United States. I´d sure love to see their faces now that the movie´s become a worldwide box office hit. The movie is filled with wonderful performances and hilarious moments (""Put some Windex on it!""). You won´t see any really huge movie stars which just goes out to show that all you need is talent to make a really memorable movie.I want to see this movie again when it comes out on DVD and I´d recommend it to anyone who likes quality comedies. You rarely see movies this good. So SEE IT!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Its gentle humor and earnestness win almost everyone over. I had an advantage, though. I know a couple of Greek families and could cast each friend with an corresponding role in the movie as it played. No culture has a monopoly on quirks, but it takes a great story teller to point them out without crossing the line into stereotype. If it ever leaves theaters, I'll buy the DVD in a heartbeat.Having said all that, I understand that it's being developed as a TV sitcom for the 2003 season. As much as I enjoyed the film, I don't look forward to this at all.

140,RJBose,Her Big Fat Hollywood Paycheck,7,19 November 2002,"A mildly amusing and harmless, if eminently predictable, movie, but scarcely original.  The fact that ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" will gross over $200 million suggests that any reasonable alternative to the mindnumbingly bleak garbage consistently generated by the major Hollywood studios will find an eager and willing audience among the movie-going public.  As many of the previous comments attest, this tale of a mis-matched bethrothal could easily have been written as almost any ethnic group (Italian, Jewish, Chinese, Bengali, and presumably, even White Anglo-Saxon Protestants).  The humor drives from the tightly knit, patriarchal ethnic family's resistence to the 30 year-old spinster's non-ethnic fiance.  Much of it, however, like most of the story, is a bit forced.Toula's rather magical and sudden transformation to an outgoing person atease with a male caller of whom she had been previously terrified is a bit odd, and her suitor's attraction to her is never fully explained.  The ethnic humor is heaped on, but I suspect that any family running a restaurant (even a Greek restaurant) would know what a ""bundt cake"" was, and that no educated and professional people such as the fiance's parents would mistake a Guatamalan housekeeper for Greek housekeeper.The whole story, as is well-known by now, is derived from a one-woman show by a Greek-American woman which caught the eye of Tom Hanks' wife and thus was able to be made into a movie.  It's all a bit overblown, but in the end she's laughing all the way to the bank and planning for the TV sit-com, while the ""big name"" stars collect millions for box-office bombs, and the big studios keep churning them out. (This movie represents $200 million less spent on such alternative cinematic gems as ""Wind Talkers"" or Harrison Ford's Russian submarine story). For the Hollywood establishment, it's a well-deserved big fat black eye.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It has none of those elements.It is quite simply the most delightful, funny, ENTERTAINING film non-stop from beginning to end. The casting and script are perfect. No fancy cinematography here, but you feel like there is no camera at all - that you are right there in the movie watching everything going on.In addition to the entire cast and production crews, Rita Wilson and her coproducer husband, Tom Hanks, all deserve raves for bringing out this really enjoyable movie in the midst of all the junk coming out of Hollywood on a steady basis. Go see it, enjoy it, and then tell all your friends to go. I predict that word of mouth will cause this great film to increase its box office in the coming weeks.A film for all ages - myself, my children, my grandchildren and even my quite young great grandchild.

142,dgz78,"Ugly Duckling Get's Married - Oh, She's Greek",5,20 August 2007,"I finally watched this movie last night on TV - maybe they cut something out that was in the theatrical release.This is a simple girl meets boy - girl doesn't lose boy - girl marries boy. The difference is that she comes from a Greek family that doesn't believe you should marry anyone but another Greek.But this could just as easily be a story about any ethnic group - Nia Vardalos happens to be Greek so its a story about a Greek family.But after she and John Corbett hook up, you expect a problem because her family is so resistant to her dating or marrying a non Greek. And every time a problem arises, it is just resolved. Corbett's not Greek, fine, he converts to Greek Orthodox. Corbett can't have his friend be the best man at the wedding, no problem - his friend understands. Family takes over planning the wedding. No problem, just a printing error on the invitations that has to be fixed.Not that this is a bad movie. It's not a bas way to kill a little time while you have nothing else to do. But it's not going to go down in cinema history. I just kept waiting for something to happen that I didn't figure out in the first 10 minutes. Even the ending where the parents buy a house for the happy couple I figured would be right next door.Maybe if the father had not come to accept her decision to marry a non-Greek until the climatic wedding it would have had some suspense. I thought when she confided in her mom that maybe her decision was killing her father like he said it was would result in some conflict to resolve. But nothing ever comes up that isn't passed over.I guess this was marketed as a comedy but it seemed like a drama without any drama. In the end it's not a comedy or a drama which is a real trick.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
143,mpofarrell,A Cinderella Story : Greek Style,7,13 September 2002,"Anything this writer could comment about MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING at this point would be superfluous. A cinematic tornado, this little movie, budgeted at 5 million dollars, has already earned 1 hundred million dollars and is still going strong.The Cinderella story of a Greek- American woman's ties (and binds) to her family and her quest to meet and marry the man of her dreams is the brain child of Nia Vardalos , a Second City alumnus who only a short time ago was performing stand-up comedy routines and a one-woman show based on her Greek family and upbringing. On one fateful night actress Rita Wilson caught Vardalos' show, went backstage to express her enthusiasm ( Wilson is of Greek descent ) and urged husband Tom Hanks to see the show the next night...the rest, they say, is history. Wilson and Hanks urged Vardalos to write a screenplay based on her stage comedy, whereupon the aspiring actress presented the couple with an already written script ; thus came into being what is undoubtedly the most successful rags to riches story since a down-on -his-luck actor named Sylvester Stallone penned a little number called ""Rocky"" over 25 years ago. Hanks and Wilson signed on as co-producers ; veteran t.v. director Joel Zwick assumed directorial chores and a number of terrific actors were cast to flesh out a movie with family members and other characters only alluded to on the stage. The resultant movie is a warm, mildly caustic but ultimately loving look at family dysfunction. Foutoula Portokalos ( Vadalos ) is a hostess at her father's Greek diner ; a seeming wallflower, poor Tula has seated too many parties and poured way too many coffees in her life. Bound by some invisible chain, her parents, siblings and assorted aunts, uncles and cousins (all named Nick, by the way) are resigned to the fact that always reliable stay -at -home Tula will forever pour the coffee and never leave the nest. When a drop dead handsome customer enters the restaurant one night to join a colleague for dinner, Tula is thunderstruck. Completely stymied by the man's presence, Tula can't even pour coffee into the man's cup and quickly makes a beeline for the hostess station. When the two men leave the diner, Tula is left with a lovely vision and the all-too-real prospect of living out the rest of her life as a lonely spinster in Diner purgatory. That is as much of the story as I'll reveal, because this movie is too funny to ruin with a long-winded rundown of the plot ; not that the viewer won't be able to surmise very quickly where the screenplay is heading. MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING is very broadly played but in the finest sitcom tradition. There is much ethnic humor, some of it repeated a little too often and some of the jokes fall flat. But most of the time this is a hilarious comedy that everyone should be able to identify with. Nia Vardalos invites you into her family's world and although it is specifically a Greek one, the universal problem of parental control and children wanting to live their own lives is an instantly recognizable one. Tula's parents are played to perfection by Michael Constantine ( from ""Room 222"") and Lanie Kazan, a wonderful singer and character actress who has graced many a movie in the past. Andrea Martin , another brilliant Second City performer, is priceless as Tula's opinionated but lovable Aunt Voula. Louis Mandylor as Tula's overly protective brother steal's every scene he's in. As to what happened to that handsome man in the diner....well, you'll have to see the movie.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

145,MichaelMovieLoft,What's Greek for 'Overrated'?,1,23 May 2003,"This movie was so big, it was held over for an 18 week engagement in our small theater (which basically set a record for how long a film has played there). When it came out on DVD, I decided to take a look at the film critics and moviegoers thought was super duper great. Needless to say, it didn't live up to the hype. That's all this movie was, an overhyped product with a bare bones average plot that has been done a million times before. The first half hour or so was amusing, but after a while I was tired of the Greek stereotypes (I'm not Greek BTW, but I do know a stereotype when I see one) and Toula's narration of how every word in the English language has some Greek origin (according to her father). The movie is mostly forgettable. I don't remember much of it after a few weeks of viewing. I do remember getting depressed in the middle of it. I honestly don't know why. I think there were some constant slow parts in the film and it just seemed to lag then go dull. Add it up with a silly final scene, and you have an average film that became overrated because Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson put their stamp of approval on it. The Oscar people also didn't let hype fool them as it was only up for one award.Then spinoff into a TV show was too much. I never watched it but I do remember hearing that it was not that great and that Nia Vardalos was very hard to get along with on the set. Thankfully, it has been sent to that big cancellation chuckwagon in the sky. CBS made it too soon and paid the price.
I do give Nia credit for trying. She was very pleasant looking and not an eysore to deal with. But in Hollywood, you are only as good as your last movie. So time will tell if Vardalos is a hitmaker or a one hit wonder. I hope it's the former and not the latter.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
146,EThompsonUMD,Worthy addition to the ethno-romantic comedy genre.,8,22 August 2002,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a small but worthy addition to the ethno-romantic comedy genre begun perhaps by ""Annie Hall"" and including such notable examples as ""Moonstruck"" and the underrated ""Crossing Delancey."" Word-of-mouth has made this low-budget, unadvertised indie release a major box office success. The main reason is simple: the film is uproariously funny! It's been a long time since I sat in a nearly full theater (during a mid-week matinée no less) and heard such universally unrestrained guffaws from an audience mixed of young and old, male and female.Although based in Greco-American customs and stereotypes, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" obviously touches the funny bones of many people with other cross-cultural romantic-social experiences - and in America that means almost everyone. Is the film's humor offensive to Greco-Americans as some critics have charged? Since I do not have Greek ancestry, nor can I claim that any of my current circle of friends are so derived, I really can't answer that question authoritatively, but I suspect that some of the loudest gales of laughter I was hearing in the theater were coming from those who share the ethnicity of the film's star and screenwriter, Nia Vardalos. It really takes a stunning degree of comic tone-deafness to miss the humor in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and instead take high offense at its ""hideous, pandering clichés that look rejected from bad Jewish and Italian sitcoms"" - to quote Entertainment Weekly's dour killjoy, Owen Gleiberman.""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is certainly no ""Annie Hall"" in wit or originality. Many of its gags are simplistic and several of its characters may charitably be described as cardboard (particularly the WASP parents of the groom). On the other hand, numerous scenes stand out as memorable pieces of farcical humor - the groom Ian Miller's Greek Orthodox baptism in a plastic child's pool, the heroine Toula's frenzied wedding preparation among a wedding party of seemingly hundreds of tackily dressed bridesmaids, and the meet-the-family lawn party/lamb roast thrown for Toula's prospective in-laws - to name a few. While verbal humor is not this film's strong point, Ian's repeated Greek language faux pas certainly bring down the house, especially when the real meanings are revealed on the screen in subtitles, an old Woody Allen device that still works.In addition to its humor, the romance in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" has a certain freshness and charm as well. Though an unlikely match physically as well as socially, Ian (John Corbett) and Toula generate an odd, but very credible and winning, screen chemistry. It was also pleasant to have the tired ""boy-loses-girl"" part of the formula missing for once. Ian has an adult determination that nothing will ultimately get in the way of his love for Toula, and, despite the bizarre family mismatch and Toula's father's initial dislike for his prospective ""xeno"" son-in-law, nothing does.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

149,m-ozfirat,Wooden Comedy,2,10 January 2018,"First of all the film is intended to be an ethnic comedy when in my view it 
would of worked better if it was a marital comedy with the bride being Greek
that could of made the jokes especially the ones based on stereotypes 
more rich and intelligent and more in its context. Stereotypes work well in ethnic style comedies so long as they do not transcend
in to the political as do most films about the Middle East especially in regards to Palestine in this film we hear lines such as ""blood thirsty Turks"" and ""Is Armenia close to Greece"" . The cultural elements in the film are also politically motivated
""the greatest civilisation"" and ""our house is surrounded by the gods"" how can an immigrant coming from a rural family be a classicist and secondly Modern Greece so called Hellas is only a recent construct prior to that they did not identify with antiquity but nationally saw themselves as Romanians just as how present day Egyptians see themselves as Arabs. The film is also a unilateral take on culture were by Greeks and Eastern Orthodox along with the Roman West are the same people with a belief in democracy that started in Greece which is why the wedding takes place in an orthodox Church. It would of been better if both these identities were represented in a non-politcal manner. Overall the only good thing about this film is the cast the characters are one dimensional and is poorly constructed with more emphasis in my view of a political agenda rather then a comical film an a hollywood trait that some ethnic and cultural groups are more favoured and exclusive then others.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Michael Constantine made a great European father, and was responsible for a large percentage of laughs. Lainie Kazan also played a very funny character. John Corbett also deserves praise.

This movie offers plenty of laughs and for once will get the audience laughing without the use of perverse toilet jokes.Although probably not too appreciated by those who are still caught on the Tom Green level of comedy, this movie is one riot from start to finish, humor with maturity.  Every character is a world in itself and when combined the audience finds itself laughing and laughing.While this movie is PG and is more relatively cleaner than other romance movies, I would not suggest bringing the younger ones, mainly because it will be the most boring hour and a half for them, and there are also several sensual moments, none too heavy though.For great comedy in a romance genre, this movie rates 6/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
153,consortpinguin,Hopa! Hopa! Hopa! The best film of the Year!,10,14 September 2002,"This is the best, most enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time. I always hear, ""They don't make movies like that anymore,"" but My Big Fat Greek Wedding proves YES THEY DO!  I don't know where to start.  The script, the story, and the acting are superb.  This movie was a ""sleeper"" that was not launched with a big publicity blitz like ""Pearl Harbor."" But word of mouth got around and the movie is still in theaters, in fact has opened at additional theaters, and I hear that it has been up as high as #2 on a few recent weekends, making over $100 million on a $5 million budget.You've probably heard the story.  Toula, a 30 year old unmarried daughter of a Greek restaurant family lives a dull life until she decides to break out of her rut in the restaurant.  She takes college courses, and convinces her aunt to let her work in her family travel agency.  She meets Ian, a handsome, interesting teacher who is everything she could want in a boyfriend except...he's NOT Greek!  When her parents discover she's dating an ""outsider"" they invite a string of un-interesting bachelors to dinner because they are Greek.  Love conquers all, and Ian gladly makes many accommodations including converting to the Greek Orthodox Church.  Finally the ethnic, but loving family welcomes him with open arms.  I loved the scenes where he meets the many colorful characters in the extended family. Being an only child with only one first cousin, he suddenly has brothers and 27 cousins, aunts, uncles, and his mother and father in law.This movie celebrates America at its finest.  We are a nation of immigrants, and we come from many different ethnic traditions.  We can continue to celebrate our heritage yet still live the American dream.  Gus, Toula's father who has succeeded in America with his wonderful restaurant, appreciates this country, and when he finally accepts Ian to be his son-in-law, it is truly touching.I think this proves that a movie can succeed on the strength of the story and the characters.  There are no car chases, no special effects, no filthy language, no graphic sex, no dominating big-name star, and no violence.Kudos to Nia Vardalos, both author and leading lady of this gem.  I definitely recommend that you see this movie while it is still in theaters. But as soon as it comes out on video, we intend to see it again.  Definitely a 10!!!  Hopa! Hopa! Hopa!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Paint a loving, funny and moving picture of the Greek-American subculture that people can relate with. Alas it almost completely fails. The characters all are flat and uninteresting. Within five minutes you know how the story develops and how it ends. The cultural clash (when the parents meet) isn't a clash as everybody behaves like idiots. The jokes, with one or two exceptions, aren't funny. The scenes that are meant to move you are emotionally void.

They marry. Her loving family is more supportive than she expects.""BFGW feels like a very dilute and feeble rip-off of ""Moonstruck"" -- it's not as complex, not as heartwarming, not half as funny and lacks the edginess and the great performances that make ""Moonstruck"" a classic.Worse, there is an unbelievable amount of ""filler"" in this 95 minute (including 4 mins of credits) movie. Unnecessary long establishing shots. Two full minutes of completely unremarkable ""let's show the girls getting ready to go to the wedding"" footage. ""Arty""(?) silences that just feel like padding. I actually went back and tried to time out the parts I felt were just long pauses (not silent parts that added to the plot or set up a joke) and found at least about 15 minutes worth. That's an ENORMOUS amount of time out of 91 minutes of movie.It's strange that this movie gets so much press as being a successful independent movie. It is the most ""Hollywood"" independent movie I've ever seen.The (underused) Andrea Martin is an insane hoot as usual. And, of course, John Corbett is just dreamy.

It is hilarious in all its jokes and quips, very light-hearted, and overall great, great fun with iconic line after iconic line.

It could just as easily been titled ""My Big Fat Italian Wedding"", or Jewish Wedding or Polish Wedding or Korean Wedding. But not very far under the surface is a portrait of love as a controlling mechanism, love as a tool for smothering. Anyone who has grown up in a family like the one portrayed knows what I'm talking about, regardless of the ethnicity of the people involved. We use humour to survive it; they use guilt to control us. Funny yes...but painfully so.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
160,zebra782,For me this is the best romantic comedy since pretty woman and four weddings and a funeral.,7,3 February 2008,"This lovely film carries a lot within it like love, family, joy and commitment.The fact that the film is simple doesn't mean it is dull and look at the total gross of it, it was a total of 241 million dollars can you believe it? Hmmmm, I think you'd better.Aside from being funny as hell this film is focusing on other things like other majorities in the US including their habits, cultures and look at that strong bound of the Greek society which should be an idol for us to follow in our own lives.Nia Vardalos is a lovely girl; I don't know if she has to continue acting but she definitely shouldn't give up her beautiful talent as a screen writer, she is absolutely genius.8/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
161,nick suess,"Even in a Greek cafe, the ethnic joke can run out of steam.",7,25 October 2002,"I saw an interview with Nia Vardalos in which she derided the Hollywood system for initially suggesting the script should be converted to an Italian or Hispanic ethnic setting. Now she has this huge success on her hands, she is certainly vindicated. But you have to ask yourself one question. Would the movie then have been any different apart from the flag on the garage door and the overworn joke about all words being derived from Greek?People of various ethnic origins joke at the over-the-top excesses of their families, especially their migrant parents and other relatives in the ""new"" country, be it the USA, UK or Australia. That's good and healthy, but a full length movie of such jokes which attempts to keep them afloat atop a plastic beachball of a plot full of air is eventually going to roll under and start to gurgle for breath.The boy meets girl story was - nothing - a serve of coffee, and a glance through a travel agency window. The non-Greek characters were cardboard cut outs. The Millers were meant to be educated people, Ian said his father was a lawyer, but they came out with ""is Greece near Armenia?"" And the message was that every Greek person is (a) lovable (b) hugely excessive (c) xenophobic. That last word is derived from Greek: Xenos meaning foreign and phobic - well the movie already did that one.I love Greece, have had many happy times there enjoying great friendship and hospitality from its people, and have even acquired a smattering of the language. I live in a city with a large Greek population, and formerly lived in the world's third largest Greek city, which happens to be Melbourne. Are Greeks in Australia for some reason far more restrained than those in America, or did we merely see the American penchant for massive over-statement? Do they really have to drive every single joke home with a sledgehammer lest a single member of the audience might fail to get it?OK, I laughed early and gave it 7/10 for a good try, but I must have been in generous mood.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
162,taikman,Predictable and sometimes corny but also charming and funny.,6,17 December 2002,"This is one of those movies that is enjoyable at the time but does not exactly linger in your memory. One of the reasons is the plot, which is basically the same Cinderella story that has been reworked in countless films. My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is the story of Toula Portokoulos (Nia Vardalos), a frumpy Greek ugly duckling who meets her Prince Charming (John Corbett as an English teacher, who are often romanticised in movies. I'm still waiting for the sensitive, sexy Calculus teacher), turns into a swan and gets a life. Eventually she decides to marry her man. The problem is, her family are quite traditional and they have issues with the role of women in the family and her marrying a non-Greek. It's a predictable, unoriginal plot and the movie is as subtle as a brass band. However what saves it from being just a routine romantic comedy are the lively performances from the Greek actors and the oddball supporting characters, particular Toula's hidebound father, a man who can trace the origin of any word back to Greek (even kimono) and who believes he is the head of the household (his wife says that may be so, but she is the neck  she tells the head where to move). It is a funny movie and, if you don't go in expecting anything great, you'll get a lot of laughs out of it. 6 1/2/ 10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

The lead woman could have remained rather frumpish and avoided the makeover scenes swiftly becoming requisite to any romantic comedy worth its salt.The lead woman could have changed as she did but avoided the too-easy romantic comedy formula of changing FOR a man. She might have then dated around a while and learned how to enjoy herself again, or else she might have explored her sexuality with both men and women.That would have been quite the welcome shock.Instead, Tula chooses to change herself precisely to win the affections of one man. When this happens in real life, the women usually realize within anywhere from one month to fifteen years that the man is cheating on her behind her back. Instead, in this movie--which apparently takes place in fantasy land, in which patriarchy will vanish simply via the power of ""love""--Tula and her husband seem very much in love. Normally I might say, more power to them--except that the precedent this sets for the young and impressionable girls who might stumble across this film on their way to a better, edgier one is awful.People need to learn to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions--even if they are as well-meaning or possibly simply as self-obsessed as these folks are.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I don't think I've ever seen a Hollywood movie with less conflict or obstacles for the two lovers to overcome before finding each other. In fact, there is no conflict at all, except that traditionalist Greek dad doesn't want his daughter to marry a non-Greek. Both of the lead characters are bland even when together, so it was left up to the 'nutty' Greek extended family to provide the energy and laughs. Luckily the supporting actors were all excellent. It is SO nice, though, to see the old 'unattractive man with unbelievably good looking girlfriend' turned on its head.

I'm glad I saw it because of Andrea Martin, and also because of Lanie Kazan, though she was under-utilized.  (See ""29th Street"" for great Lanie and for genuine sentiment, not sentimentality.)

171,ikizdevran-882-254684,Love is here to stay... So is her family.,7,1 July 2018,"Because they are unknown and, therefore, a mystery to the audience, stories about distant cultures are always welcome in cinema. You can pretty much play around the story and make it appealable. Director Joel Zwick uses this power in a positive, non-exaggerated way and creates a sweet film. In this point of view, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a highly enjoyable and sincere romantic comedy. Everyone in the film is like a real character from the real world. Because of the performances, you get the feeling like they are a real family. This film tends to entertain the audience by pointing out the funny or unaccustomed styles of the Greek Culture. Of course, not everything you see is real but keeping this within the limits of acceptance is one of the strongest points of the film. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is not story based. What is happening around the story is the real thing. The film is about Ian (John Corbett) and Toula (Nia Vardalos) meeting, dating and getting married. Toula has a highly traditional Greek family none of which has ever been married with a non-Greek. Toula being the strong female character of the film, she educates herself and gets what she wants against the general belief that the missions of a Greek woman which are to marry a Greek man, to have Greek children and to feed everyone until the day she dies. The film opens with this explanation and gives us some early clues about the story of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""Toula has a huge family and each character is convincingly funny. While you are watching the film, you forget the fact that they are acting. This creates a cozy, sincere and warm environment for the audience. The family is also highly proud to be Greek. Toula's father claims that every word has a Greek root and tries aimlessly to find connections between the words and their possible Greek roots. During the film, I was amazed to see how many common things Turks and Greeks are sharing. As a Turkish citizen, even I was surprised to find out more about Greeks, so imagine how Americans must have felt while watching the film. Ian's mother and father are the visual representatives of the American people.Having a big family has its own advantages and disadvantages. Film uses the concept of the big family as an advantage, making ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" a character oriented film. Each character has its own story and background and they have unbelievably strong bonds which can't be broken. Human beings are social creatures. To feel good, secure and peaceful, we need to belong somewhere. This is a universal truth. That's why we make families and friends, that's why we create bonds with people. This idea is integrated with the story in a way which makes the film enjoyable. The audience finds a place for themselves in Portokalos family and that's why accepts the film as one of their own. This might explain the financial success of the film with a very little promotion and marketing. It went even further and got itself a nomination at the 75th Academy Awards for The Best Original Screenplay. After the film, Nia Vardalos created a sitcom on the same idea with Marsh McCall and produced it along with the producers of the film, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson. However, the serial ended after 7 episodes. Eventually they made a sequel in 2016 to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" in which Toula's mother is getting married with her father after fifty years being together. This film turned out not to be as successful as the first one.""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is not a standard Hollywood film where even the most beautiful actresses can't get a date. Nia Vardalos is the heroine of the film. Because she is not a standard Hollywood actress, her struggles seem real. It is very normal for Toula not to be able to kick off her life or not being able to find a date. This can happen in real life. She is single and 30 years old which is totally against her family's beliefs, she can't find a date because she is not attractive and always under the shadow of her father. Everyone in the film is acting with a real amateur spirit and this creates film's sincerity and credibility, which are the other strong points of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Directed by Joel Zwick and written by Nia Vardalos, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is a highly entertaining film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
172,McHuevo,A family movie for the family,7,8 February 2003,"There was much expectation here in Mexico to see ""My big fat greek wedding"" since it was one of the surprise box office hits in the USA.The movie, however, did not have the same impact on the mexican audience. Maybe the USA movie goers found very amusing the story of an extremely close and large family, with conservative values and a knack for traditions, going crazy because of a wedding. In Mexico it's something you see twice or thrice a year. So, many of the people that watched the movie left the theater asking themselves ""That's it?"".Aside from that, I think it was a very nice romantic story. It deals mainly with coping with the family and finally getting to enjoy being a part of it. What I liked about it is that it went right to the point, it does not have unexpected turns or complicated obstacles. It just about a greek woman and an american man getting married; it's that simple, yet funny.I got some good laughs but not a lot more than what I got from the trailer.

The part that is one of the most humorest was when Ian met Toula's whole family for the first time...my step dad, who came from a family like Ian's looked like how Ian did. I am so glad John Corbett is back on the screen.  I loved him in Northern Exposure.He s just a really good looking guy.

174,jeev7882,there is truly something in MBFGW one for everyone,8,4 December 2002,"This is easily one of the most enjoyable times at the movies so far this year. MBFGW never allows itself to divulge into the seriousness of its situation. We are never left dangling in a realm of uneasiness or boredom. Instead we are taken on a comical journey of a woman's fight to shape her own life. Her brother puts it best when he says ""don't let the past dictate who you are, but let it be a part of who you are going to be."" This is about as serious as the movie gets as the rest of it takes a lighter approach to Toula's romance and wedding.This is so reminiscent of Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding because of the surface similarities of the two families in focus. The Portokalos in MBFGW are a huge family who take interest in and care for each other's lives up to the very finest detail. Toula's father is the true star of this movie. Michael Constantine plays the most satirical character of the whole lot. His over the top portrayal of a traditional Greek father is classic. Gus (Toula's father) has little ""insane"" character traits showing everyone how every English word has its root in Greek, insisting that Windex is the cure for every ailment, and living in a Parthenon-like house with the Greek flag on the garage door.The rest of the cast is good, especially the rest of the stereotypical Greek family of aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Our lovely couple of Toula and Ian are also perfect; they are two normal average looking people who fall in love through a series of events. They give this movie a certain believability that almost all romance stories lack. Still, no one person can be commended for the strength of this movie. The story is straightforward, but its execution is what makes this a big triumph. We get to know Toula's entire family in the short length of MBFGW without being bogged down with too many details.I cannot say enough about this movie, but it is hard to talk about a movie like this more without getting redundant. I highly recommend MBFGW to people of any age, there is truly something in this one for everyone.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
175,henfish,My Big Fatuous Greek Wedding,3,28 October 2002,"A Greek-American 'Plain Jane' is eventually allowed to go to college at the age of 30 and, with a newly discovered confidence, attracts a handsome WASP American.  Unfortunately, her parents will only allow her to marry another Greek and thus various hilarious (ha-ha) complications ensue.  These would all appear to amount to the man selling his background and family down the drain in order to accommodate what must be the most pig-headed, vulgar, insensitive, crass family in the whole of the Western hemisphere.MBFGW is one of those phenomena I can only equate to the maxim: Eat S**t - A Million Flies Can't Be Wrong!  This is a poorly made, poorly written, infrequently funny rom-com in which very few of the characters end the story with redeeming qualities.  I have an Aunt who is Greek and I have to say that it must be a trans-Atlantic thing because, as far as I'm aware, she's a million miles away from the naffly offensive stereotype represented in this film.  And a quarter of a century ago she married my catholic English uncle in an English catholic church with her whole family present (and me in a fetching cream leather two-piece [I was only 8!]) and nobody said 'Boo!'. The reception, I'm happy to add, was in a Greek restaurant.  So maybe - as has already been mentioned - the Greek ex-pats who don't find themselves in the good ol' US don't necessarily feel obliged to act in extremely OTT manner and alienate any non-Greeks who might come into contact with them. Or, then again, maybe there are only a few Greek ex-pats as awful as the ones seen here - but Hollywood was not interested in a film about the tasteful, decent, normal, representative ones.  Hmmm...

It also touches on the subject of dating when you're older and doing so when you're not a knock-out. This is good stuff! The movie is fun, informative, playful, and full of laughs.

It was nice to see the family embracing their heritage. So many films have just the opposite. At the end of the film Toula says that while they may be loud and crazy they are her family and they will always be there for her. That is the heart of the film. It is also one of the most romantic clean films out there. It's a film you can watch with your family without it being awkward. The one sex scene is very mild.

She is playing a 30-year old woman, and if you are not already married at this age in Greece, you are considered ""done, with no future"" pretty much.

It's easy to see the appeal of the stage show--everyone likes to bitch about their family and the characters are hyper-exaggerated like a standup routine--but on film it just comes across like a thin collection of cheap gags spread out over two hours (which it definitely feels like).

I personally had my own big fat Turkish wedding and many of the characters reminded me of my family.  Possible SpoilersSome of the parallels between my own life and the film were fun to watch, but I can't imagine any average American liking this movie.  The movie basically says that Americans lead dull and boring lives devoid of parties and lamb roasting on a spit in the front yard.  It's critical of Turkey which is typical and none of the characters with the exception of the father (Michael Constantine) have any depth.  Sure there are some funny moments (Gus and his windex, the grandma getting hosed by the sprinklers) and one touching one (her parents wedding present), but the film plays more like a cross between stand-up comedy and an episode of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" than a feature film.Perhaps most perplexing is Nia Vardalos.  I was thrilled to see a real-looking actress front and center rather than the fake Julia Roberts type.  Unfortunately, Vardalos is not meant to be a lead.  Perhaps its the script and Vardalos will be better in the sitcom.  John Corbett phones it in as the man of her dreams.

The sequence of events, the characters and the direction stand well overall. Here one finds amassed many traits from real life situations in Greek-American families. Some oversimplifications and exaggerations are justified due to the comic nature of the film. One has to take into consideration that the film is portraying Greek-Americans through the eyes of a second generation Greek and this is perhaps the reason why it doesn't get much to the real psyche of the first generation Greeks in the movie.

It plays like a bad sit-com which it turned into and lasted 3 weeks before being cancelled.  There isn't a single thing you an point to and say it's bad it's just dull and not funny. I tried to get my 15 year old daughter to watch it thinking that maybe I just don't get it but she turned it off about half way through. I told it her maybe she will like the end better but she said she didn't want to waste her time.  I see the star/producers latest movie bombed and though I haven't seen it I would be willing to bet it's the same quality as this one.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
190,philfromno,Torturous,1,3 March 2003,"I find it unfathomable that this film was the breakout hit of last year.  My only guess is that it drove people to the theatre who were excited that it was low on curse words and sex.  Which is fine, but I wish that they could have added a bit of humor or drama. There has been a lot of crowing about the crass stereotypes in this film, to which I can only respond ""what stereotypes?""  These characters are drawn so flimsily that they don't even reach the level of stereotypes.  Michael Constantine, playing the supposedly charming and wacky father, is colorless except for an obsession with Greek root words and the healing powers of Windex.  Are you laughing yet?  I hope so, because that's all you get. But at least Constantine has a couple of defining character traits.  We learn nothing about the other characters except that they are Greek.  Well, Greek and obnoxious.  This movie would have us believe that Greek Americans' life revolves entirely around their ethinicity, and yet the only defining thing about being Greek is that you sit around and constantly discuss the fact that you are Greek. For contrast, we have Corbett's parents, who embody some nightmare thumbnail sketch of Waspish stereotype.  Surreally quiet and psychotically uncomfortable, they act as if they've never met a mediterranean before.  The exchange of idiocies when the WASP mother tries to explain to the apparently retarded Greek mother that the cake she brought to dinner is a bundt cake is one of the more cringe inducing comedy moments here. Another reviewer here remarked, as if it were a good thing, that the observations in this movie could be easily applied to any number of ethnic groups.  I wholeheartedly agree, and add that all it would take to turn it into My Big Fat Italian (Jewish, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Armenian, Spanish, etc.) Wedding would be a quick find/replace command on the screenwriter's laptop. When a movie's highest moment of tension comes from a wedding morning zit (a problem solved minutes later by a stick of cover up)  you know you're dealing with a limp excuse for a film. I'm not asking for The Graduate here, but frankly I can't find a thing about this movie that is worth your time or money.  But, apparently, America disagrees, so this movie made over 200 million bucks and is not being turned into the sitcom it always more or less resembled.  Go figure.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I almost exploded from laughing so hard several times (especially with the purposely mistranslated Greek). I also liked the Windex jokes and the thought that love can happen no matter who you are. Without this movie, comedy would be a pointless bunch of physical comedy. With it, it does so, but very cleverly has a plot (Jim Carrey and Mike Myers take note...)",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

193,Ell-4,A really Enjoyable Wedding,9,19 June 2002,"As I was watching ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" ---- ""Moonstruck"" and ""Goodbye Columbus"" immediately came to mind. All three about weddings. All three stereotypical. All three,somewhat tongue in cheek and all delightful.To me to be able to laugh and cry all in one film is a super feeling. Maybe none of these films are quite real to life but the enjoyment is the fact that this is how we would like life to be. Who doesn't want a happy ending and couples to live happily ever after. (Exception of course in ""Goodbye Columbus"") As for the acting, Lainie Kazan, born Lainie Levine playing the role of the understanding, loving Greek mother was outstanding. Don't even have to use the word ""Greek""---understanding, loving mother, more than says it.  Also a beautiful bride that was not paper thin was refreshing and true to life.As for actor, John Corbett the almost too good to be  fiancé, how good to see him again. Have missed him since his tv days on ""Northern Exposure"" His compassionate facial expressions have always been good to watch.

It is not weighted down with the need to know humongous back stories, but rather the backstory can be found within our own day to day apprehension about our own world and predominantly our own families.This film is a true comedy, not a comedic spectacle with juvenile humor (except, where of course, it is very appropriate). The film truly shows the coming of age story does not always have to be about teens. It is truly a comedy and truly worth watching. Similar to the Royal Tennenbaums.

I was able to recommend it to my mother-in-law without having to say ""If you ignore the abundant foul language, bloodshed, potty humour, and sex scenes, you'll love this movie!"".  Nia Vardalos stars as Toula, a Greek woman of 30 who has not yet married. The movie begins with a brief rundown of her history with her family, and starts off with her feeling a bit hopeless and downhearted, wondering if anything will ever change.Then, she decides to branch out and make something of her life, taking advantage of her interest and talent with computers, and upgrade her skills at college.  She buys new clothes and does her hair and feels a bit better about herself.  Then she meets Ian (Michael Corbett), a non-Greek highschool teacher.  They date and fall in love, much to the chagrin of her very Greek Orthodox family.As you watch the things Ian does to gain acceptance of Toula's family, and see the humorous ways in which this is portrayed, you will feel like a part of the family yourself.I highly recommend owning the DVD.  The characters are fairly easy to relate to.  They chose a cast of average looking actors that did not all look like supermodels, everyone was realistic looking.

202,lee-96696,Horribly Cliched Rom-Com with Ridiculous Ethnic Stereotypes,2,27 September 2020,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it is hard to start.But first, why has it been so popular? There is nothing special about it al all. In fact, much of it is cliched, and annoying. My only guess is that it was released in 2002 while the country was still in the shock-aftermath of 9/11 and just into a war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I remember meatloaf, mac and cheese, and spaghetti and meatballs -- comfort foods -- were all the rage then too. Maybe this is the cinematic equivalent. A comfort film. Folks in late '02 craved un-thinking, simple, feel-good movies.OR, Perhaps it was everyone's second choice movie at the Cineplex. Family fare and date movie that worked when Bad Boys II and Finding Nemo did not fill the bill.As for the movie itself:--It's a totally conventional, paint-by-numbers rom com with a much smaller than usual budget. (Exteriors mostly shot on two blocks in Toronto).--The characters are ridiculously overdrawn, stereotyped ""ethnics"". I know a few first and second generation immigrant families and none of them come anywhere near this level of obnoxiousness. Most want to blend in and Americanize, not flamboyantly call attention to themselves. Even the dour, super-creepy WASP parents of the groom are treated like exotic zoo creatures, as if they had never met someone outside their country club set. Most cringe-worthy gag: the Greeks being completely baffled by the hole in a bundt cake brought by the WASP family to a pre-wedding dinner. I mean really?--The lead character and narrator, frumpy, ""aging"" 30-year old Toula, is not very credible. She suddenly does a metamorphoses from dowdy to beautiful overnight and within minutes becomes engaged to brooding, hunky high school teacher Ian (a low energy, wimpy, no-chemistry John Corbett). Very little light is shed on the courtship or sudden wedding plans.--Toula's love interest is, as we'd say in 2020, a complete beta-male. He completely sublimates his personality, his beliefs (if he has any, we're not sure) to fit in with her family. At one point he even converts to the Eastern Orthodox Church. There is no conflict, no dramatic pushback at all. In fact, there is almost no conflict in the entire movie.--Toula's dad (Michael Constantine) is the most annoying of all. The running jokes about Windex and the Greek origin of words may be funny the first time but by the 20th? And must he speak every line in a histrionic 120 decibels?So, two stars for me. The extra star is for a well-intenioned, earnest attempt.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the non-traditional comedy.,My Big Fat Greek Wedding
204,historical_account,Shallow,4,7 September 2003,"This movie had a lot of potential, but the story was rushed (one line here or there to explain *a lot* such as why the groom isn't happy with the girls he's typically been dating), then there was the development of bride/groom meeting which was very 'forced', it just didn't seem natural.Then there were the families and friends that were one-dimensional stereotypes.  The groom's parents were almost non-existent and each of the other cast members had a token, rushed scene to develop who they were.  The only supporting character that had any real depth was the bride's mother.As a cross-cultural married couple (American & Japanese), we found that much of the real good territory available for exploring (such as perceived expectations in social situations, who pays for what in a wedding, or the differing life and social goals, etc.) was noticeably absent.Thus we have to view this film as shallow and give it a 5/10.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

There is no real conflict in the film, the characters are uninspired stereotypes; the only recommendation anyone can honestly give is that it's ""cute"". Some have told me that it is a realistic portrayal of Greeks in America; I think Greeks should be insulted by this. Am I to believe that this is the same culture that produced the foundations of all philosophy, as well as some of the greatest mythology and art of all time (not to mention Nikos Kazantzakis, author of ZORBA THE GREEK and THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST)? The fact that all of the film's so-called ""humor"" is derived from the cultural differences of the Greeks does not make the film realistic or in any way charming.

208,Ihad,Put some Windax on!,7,17 January 2003,"I happened to see this movie by mere accident. The title was a little weird I thought and so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I went in without having read anything about it and I came out thoroughly pleased and amused. This movie wants to be funny and entertaining and it certainly succeeds. Granted, the story is plain enough but it is the interaction between the characters that make this work.Having been to Greece a number of times I happen to like that culture and the climate there. When the movie begins we hear Greek music and see a dark and rainy night in Chicago. Strange stuff, it doesn't fit together, yet. Then we see two people in a car stopping at a traffic sign. One the father, the other the daughter. Both Greek. ""You should get married, you are starting to look ... old!"" the father tells the daughter. From there on it is clear where this will lead. We don't mind knowing what will happen, it's just refreshing to watch those characters and watch as the daughter tries to break lose from her predefined path, succeeds and when she finally even dates a guy, we again know what's going to happen and again it's fun to watch.""Is he Greek? No. Is he good? We don't know! Because no one talks to us about nothing any more!"" A father loses control and a daughter gains a husband AND a house... next door.The only problem one might have with this movie is if you take it as a defamation of the Greek people per se. You mustn't. I do not think any Greek would be offended by this movie, yet there may always be one, at least I am positive that it is not the movie's nor the directors intention to do so.I watched it in the light of a lighthearted comedy, suitable for the whole family and as such it was quite entertaining and funny and next time you go to a Greek restaurant you'll probably be smiling, thinking of ""Dancing Zorbas"" (incidentally there's one near my place called ""Apollo"" and it too has all the Greek columns and statues at the entrance).8/10Ihad",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

216,kanerazor,"Amusing, but give me a break",1,16 November 2002,"When I saw this movie months ago, it was simply an ""indie hit"" and i thought ""I can see what the fuss was about.""  But since then, the more successful it's gotten, the more I've grown to loathe it.  $200 million+!  Come on, no Julia Roberts movie has ever even made that much!  And I'm sure fans of this movie will say that it deserves to be more successful, because it is about a ""real"" woman.  Well for a movie that's supposed to speak to ""real"" people, this sure comes across as a silly banal fantasy.  I have to say that it's missing that special ingredient present in the best romantic comedies-romance.Help me out here, what exactly is so great about Toula?  That she works at a travel agency?  That she knows how to use a computer?  That she eats white bread sandwiches?  That she's confident?  Woe is me, if only I could find such a remarkable woman.  Many films are insulting to the audiences' intelligence in that they take a beautiful woman, change her hair and give her glasses, and claim she's ""ugly"".  This movie is just as bad in a different way.  Nia Vardalos does make herself look quite gross at the beginning of the movie.  And after getting the contacs and perm, she's not ugly anymore.  However, she is certainly no Miss Universe and the film's expecting us to believe that John Corbett would take one look at her and instantly be infatuated is ridiculous.  I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder but here the attraction was based purely on outer beauty at first. And let's talk about inner beauty-when do we see that?  Toula seems reasonably nice, but nothing like Gwenyth Paltrow's character in Shallow Hal.  And she's not charming either.  I had a film class TA at school once who liked kinda like Toula, but I thought she was very attractive because of her lovely personality.  I think the only time Toula even shows a hint of personality is when she jokes with Ian about the ""old lady ass kicking"".
I found no memorable dialogue or chemistry whatsoever between the leads in this movie (I don't care how Julia Roberts looks, Notting Hill had those in spades) and the whole story line, what there was of one, was dumb.  OK so he sees her once after she's made over, and from then on out he kisses the ground she walks on, doing everything he can to make her happy without even asking for anything in return other than her love (Oh Ian, you came and you gave without taking...bleh).  I'm guessing the reason this movie has been such a colossal hit is because it appeals to the fantasies of all the unattractive middle aged women out there who daydream that if they got a makeover they could have a perfect man idolizing them instead of being stuck with their fat bald husbands who always forget their anniversaries and birthdays.Now maybe I'm kind of missing the point, and the most important thing about this movie is not the romance but the comedy.  Well okay, I thought that was decent.  I laughed at the Windex, and there were other lines and moments which I thought were clever.  But it's nothing special.  The whole movie was basically a sophomoric sitcom (maybe that's a reduntant phrase) with one dimensional stereotypcial characters and contrived silly situations.
Not that that can't be entertaining.  I'll reiterate that I liked the movie in the theater.  My comments have been so negative just because I'm so sick of all the attention and praise it's getting.  I'd say that this movie is worth maybe a DVD rental, or better yet just watching on tv if you have nothing better do.  I agree with the person on the message board who said that, given all the challenging, mesmerizing independent fare out there, it's upsetting filmgoers have made My Big Fat Greek Wedding the most successful independent movie of all time by a huge margin.  I think in a fairer world, where effort and talent proportionately yielded box office, this movie would have made the one making $24 million (still a huge profit off of a $3 million budget) and Memento and Christopher Nolan would be reaping the benefits of a $200 million gross.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

218,cifra2,"Just a good movie, nothing more... and nothing less!",7,26 November 2002,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding *** (out of five) by Joel Zwick with Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Michael Constantine and a good ensemble.
So, this is the cinderella story of the year, in and out of the screen... the word-of-mouth phenomenom that has stormed America and put itself as the outsider for a Best Picture nod.I really can understand that the movie has survived the maelstrom of the summer box-office, as its appeal is almost universal... but what I really can't understand is... why 200 million?OK... it's a just good movie, with good performances (Michael Constantine and Nia Vardalos as standouts, if there's really any in a perfect ensemble), some good laughs, but NOTHING we haven't seen before and better.I'm Spanish, and I can assure you that changing some details, this could have been My Big Fat Spanish Wedding... or My Big Fat Arab Wedding (as I was born in a city whose half population is muslim)... or whatever...Actually, the movie has two parts: first we get to the required cinderella story that fuels the introduction of the characters... when at the middle of the movie we get to the wedding plot itself, I was too much reminded of the excellence of The Wedding Banquet, one of Ang Lee's masterpieces and that Nia Vardalos obviously has not only seen but loved.Vardalos has written a good screenplay with plenty of laughs here and there and a good sense of pacing and what's funny. Kudos to her, but one thing is to write a good screenplay, avoiding plagiarism and another is to avoid falling into common places (even if you disguise them with the blue and white colors of the Greek flag)... Joel Zwick directs just correctly and without a defined personality this material that in other hands - Ang Lee, Paul J. Hogan - could have result in a very good movie... but instead we have a merry hour and a half of tender - not sappy, thanks God - cultural clash and an ode to the mediterranean sense of family.At the performances, we have the explanation of the movie's success... we haven't here the Oscar worthy showy roles that one could expect given the buzz, but the perfect definition of comedic timing in an ensemble piece. Nia Vardalos obviously gets the more screen time, as John Corbett and Michael Constantine become the two main male pressences that divide Vardalos' character development... but it wouldn't be fair to highlight them as the movie belongs to the whole cast. I foresee a well deserved Best Ensemble nomination at the Screen Actors Guild...However, Miss Vardalos may score a double nod at the Oscars... Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. As good as she is at both categories, I think that she doesn't really deserve any of these nods... Same can also be said for Michael Constantine's performance... he's really good, but not Oscar worthy, even thought that this one is a golden chance to give him some well-deserved recognition (bearing in mind that he may never be honored with a life-time achievement Oscar).But what I feel is the strongest point (Ensemble aside) of the movie is that beautiful and merry greek score that has been seriously overlooked by oscar-watchers. The music really gives the mood of the movie in those transitions from one sequence to another and keeps the film alive. If the year isn't much strange, this music could make company to ""Signs""' at the Best Score final quintet of the year.To summarize, a good movie whose best recognition is the huge box-office success it has scored, and that really doesn't need to go beyond that. It isn't by far, one of the year's best, but being just a good movie is enough in my opinion. Not many movies can claim to be one.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
219,DeviousMrBlonde,Hollywood Strikes Back,4,11 December 2002,"Horrible, horrible movie. Granted there are some funny scenes but in the end this is cliché at it's worst. There is obviously a book somewhere called ""Make-A -Movie-By-Numbers"".We've been thankfully seeing somewhat of a renaissance in Independent Movie making of late but this movie marks the fight back from Hollywood. They have obviously planted someone out there to make movies under the independent movie label but in reality the movies contain all the usual Hollywood crap. Another reviewer asks `Why don't other independent films receive the patience accorded to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""?'. Simple, this isn't an Independent movie, at least not in the quality sense. I guarantee you that the reason this movie made so much money is because of the same people who made Runaway Bride gross $150m. or think Coyote Ugly doesn't melt your brain.$200m. How can this waste of a movie make that kind of money? I am so happy to relate that not one cent of my hard earned cash went to this.Here look, I'll save you the time and money: 1. Ugly Greek Girl stuck under the thumb of parents. 2. Is allowed to go to college and puts on makeup and suddenly becomes much more attractive. 3.

His parents are stiff protestant types and find the whole Greek thing hard to understand. 8. Cue standard scene of merriment and dancing by ethnic group to show how easy going they are (also applies to all movies with Irish or Indian people). 9. She is allowed to grow but still holds some respect for aspects of her culture. 10. Big wedding happens. 11. His stiff parents learn to dance and loosen up like the ethnic group. 12. Everyone is happy. The world is a beautiful place. (the first time we see his parents I turned to my gf and bet her that by the end of the movie they would be dancing and guess what - I won).Another movie of exactly the same ilk recently was Bend it Like Beckham.Now I am sure that some of you are thinking I am just cold-hearted but I love feel good movies, when they are decent movies.

223,sryder-1,"Extended Sitcom, with Very Fine Performances",8,25 January 2006,"It's not surprising that an (unsuccessful) attempt was made, after the surprising success of this film with a rather bizarre title, to base a weekly TV sitcom based on the characters. Like a well done sitcom, Greek Wedding goes down easily and warms the heart with its adaptation of Romeo and Juliet or Abie's Irish Rose. This means that the story of young love and family opposition goes down easily and makes a pleasant way to spend the evening. Even though the ethnic disparity between the two families is there, it is given a comedic edge, and no one can doubt that all will work out well. Of course, there is more material than could be contained in a half-hour sitcom, but the elements of the plot could have been divided so as to stretch out the story over a period of weeks. For instance, the boy's vegetarian preference could have made an entire episode. What does set Greek Wedding above the typical sitcom, however, is the high level of the performances, especially those of Michael Constantine and Laine Kazan as the girl's parents. Even as he is condemning the match it is clear that he truly loves his daughter; and because she is so strong (and wise)as the archetypal mother the outcome is never in doubt. There are few false notes, and most viewers will not regret the time spent with these families.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

The dialog keeps you laughing constantly and you don't worry about bothering anyone else in the theatre because they are all laughing too.  You fall in love with Toula's family and Toula herself as the movie progresses and you see the wonderful, whacky family attempting to welcome the non-Greek Miller into the family. The hilarious attempts by the fiance to pronounce Greek phrases his prospective brother-in-law, Angelo, gives him will have you on the floor. The scenes of interaction when the two families meet for the first time add to the growing charm of this little film, and I hope to see it garner some Oscars when the academy meets next.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

One laughs frequently during the film. But it is a very likeable movie because all the characters are likeable.If one wants to step back and reflect for a minute there is something to be said about the American culture and its tendency to try to absorb everything else.Obviously here is a good counter example with different and refreshing values.

I would have rated this movie higher if Ian had even feigned a little anxiety over Toula's family steamrolling his wedding and life. He didn't - he was far too malleable to be believed.That being said - there is a lot to like about this movie because it is NOT conventional Hollywood fare. Toula is a very pretty woman, but not your typical Hollywood 96 lb. beauty queen. The movie has its fun with Greek culture and family, but also underscores its importance. The movie conveys a strong sense of feminism - but not the man-hating feminism that is so prevalent in certain women's rights groups that use acronyms that rhyme with COW or PLOW. I have known many a first and second generation Greek in my life, and this movie ABSOLUTELY NAILS THE DYNAMIC of their lives.

A computer might as well have written this movie.It wasn't bad necessarily, but it was a long, long, way from being anything but mediocre fluff.The jokes were okay, but we've all seen them before.  The chemistry wasn't particularly believable. What's with her going into a mute shock the first time she saw that John Corbett fella? It's like she's never seen an attractive man before. Does walking a few blocks down the street take her 12 hours due to all the mute shocks she goes into every time a moderately good looking guy walks by?Some movies can subtly show a relationship developing without the red-flashing lights indicating to the audience these two people are going to end up together. I wouldn't even call what they had a relationship.  Still not sure what they saw each other as they were getting married like 4 seconds after they met. Seems like they both wanted to get married, and hooked onto the first attractive person that came along.I'd also like to point out for a woman that's supposedly trying to find her own identity and buck off a few of the cliches she's forced to live with as a Greek unmarried woman, why is it she only finds happiness after ... you guessed it ... SHE FINDS A MAN AND GETS MARRIED.  And why does she basically force her betrothed to become Greek Orthodox?  Screw that.  She was pretty spineless in the end after all.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

232,emily37,big fat stupid reviewers,7,16 April 2003,"i usually hate dissing the other reviewers on these things because everyone is entitled to their opinions, but, even though they usually frustrate me, i always read the reviews to gauge how a movie affects the mainstream public, as i think that's usually the most important thing to be considered.i just finished commenting on 'the rules of attraction', and it surprised me to see how there were more positive comments about that film than this one. it also surprised me to see that most of the negative reviews of this film talked about how they were 'bored' by this movie, or how nia vardalos is 'ugly', or how this film is only for 'women' or 'old people'.granted, this movie has very little sex, violence, or MTV editing, but it does what most movies try to do and fail at doing; creates an engaging story with interesting characters.  however, it's sad to see that this quality apparently doesn't carry much currency anymore, and that people can't deal with humor that's not shoved in their face or isn't right there on the surface.the ironic thing about this is that MBFGW isn't even that innovative or unique.  it takes the normal three act romantic comedy structure and, well, dehollywoodizes it a little bit.  yeah, the main characters aren't typical hollywood hot. (well, john corbett is...) but you probably aren't either. and all these people commenting on how it's 'racist' or 'stereotyped'... nia vardalos, the writer, IS GREEK!  this film is adapted from her one woman show!  it's interesting that 'ethnic' films have to take on, what, a documentary form or something to seem authentic?  if anything is racist, that is.it's super that 11,000 people have voted on this film and that it grossed so much $$.  even though, when it comes down to it, this is just a ""better"" romantic comedy which stays in the box for much of the time, it IS, indeed, better than most movie fare out there and its popularity gives me hope that the ""boring"" movies with ""ugly"" people may have a chance with the jaded tards of middle america.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

238,david_bixby,Charming,8,18 October 2002,"By now, this ""sleeper"" hit has probably been seen by enough people to render my comments useful to only a very few.  Regardless, I felt obliged to jot something down.The film tells the story of an ugly duckling who falls in love with, and marries her prince.  Our ugly duckling (Fortula or Tula for short), has always been a bit uncomfortable trying to fit into both her American surroundings and into the expectations of her Greek family.  Her Father (and her entire extended family) expect her to marry a nice Greek boy and turn out nice Greek children.  Unfortunately for Tula, her prince turns out to be very American.I really enjoyed this film.  I found it charming, and laughed out loud frequently at the antics of the Fortula's family.  I especially enjoyed the fact that the ugly duckling in this picture was not some Hollywood glamour girl or teen beauty queen dressed up to look frumpy (e.g., She's All That); it made the movie so much more believable.*There is nothing terribly heavy about this movie; you never really have to wonder if something terrible is going to happen or whether someone is going to have to overcome something catastrophic for this romance to work.I gave this movie an 8",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
239,mgressma,"If you want laughs, this is the movie to see.",10,17 April 2002,"I hate to sound like a critic, but ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is the best movie of the year. Nia Vardalos, the star and writer of this movie has created a masterpiece.  Off the top of my head, I think only Neil Simon packs as many genuine laughs into his screenplays, as Nia does in this one.Nia is wonderful as Toula Portokalos, and John Corbett is a perfect Ian Miller, her suitor. The performances of the other players are excellent across the board.  From Michael Constantine (father Gus), to Lainie Kazan (mother Maria), to Andrea Martin (aunt Voula).  Bess Meisler is a hoot as Gus's mother, recently brought over from Greece.The story itself is a standard. Toula, 30, single, and ""old looking"" (her fathers words), is stuck in a dead end job as a waitress (she prefers the title ""seating hostess"").  She decides to go to college to study computer science, and, having taken this bold step out into the real world, a transformation occurs.  She gains confidence, chucks her eyeglasses for contacts, and, after taking a job in her aunt's travel agency, attracts Ian.  This all doesn't sit well with her father, only because Ian Miller is not Greek.  If he were Greek, Gus would be in heaven, but there would be no movie.Luckily for us, he isn't Greek, and there is this wonderful film. Gus puts up a bit of a fight over Ian's non-Greekness, but Maria intervenes, and sees the true love that Toula has found, which is something the whole family has been hopeing for.  Ian's parents are quiet and reserved, providing the perfect contrast to the boisterous Portokalos clan. The courtship is brief and quickly progresses to the wedding, with many laugh filled moments in between.

The purpose of films such as this is to denigrate a European culture.  This is done over and over again in context after context.  The only culture that is not belittled is African American with such films as Malcolm X and many Spike Lee and other black films which praise and even use the most complimentary camera tones to build up his actors.This attempt to take down anything at all European  is even the root of comedies such as Austin Powers while buildig up anything African.

Every supporting player in the cast filled their role perfectly, playing the material up to the nines.  Much has been said about this being a veritable anti-summer movie summer, and films like ""My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding,"" ""Insomnia"" and ""Road to Perdition"" make it difficult to disagree.

Not going to make the same mistake twice! Her fiancé agrees to be baptized in the Orthodox church, and Toula's bimbo cousin Nikki is his godmother. Nice boobs.He must really love Toula a bunch, huh? Seems to pleasantly endure an awful lot: the baptism, the pranks, the fact that his wedding is co-opted by her family and that his parents are marginalized. Yup, he must love their daughter a whole lot.Maybe they realize this?The food. Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) tells Ian to come over her house for a big meal; he says he's a vegetarian and she says ""that's OK, I'll make lamb"".

Families do have jokes that are repeated and repeated, so the 'everything is cured by Windex' and the 'every word has a Greek origin' jokes are made time after time for a good reason.The caricatures, similarly, are there for a reason, and that reason is that this is a comedy. The characters are stereotypical, clichéd and charicaturish for comic effect. Other than that, this is a very light and fluffy film, but, since when has that necessarily been a negative? I think that, sometimes we need light and fluffy, and with this particular dollop of light and fluffy Nia Vardalos has given us a real gem, one that it is nigh impossible not to smile at.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I went to see this movie with these false expectations, and result was really disappointing! Forst of all don't believe this cheat: this movie is not independent at all! Financially maybe, but not from the art's point of view. When I think about independent movies, directors like Tarantino come to my mind, people who create a new form of visual art. But this movie is just an everyday crap, shouldn't deserve theatre screenings, not even a Sunday afternoon on HBO. The whole movie is built on boring and irritating clichés. What's so funny about the fact that Greek people are different to others??? What's so funny about the supposed fact, that Greek women are hairier than female representatives of other nations??? The whole plot could be summarized like that: 10 minutes of bad jokes, 10 minutes of cheesy, romantic (or at least the creators thought like that) scenes, than again a few minutes of bad, simple and primitive humour. To sum it up: DON'T EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
273,tonellinon,really??!,1,21 August 2012,"This movie has nothing to do with Greek-Americans. Greek- Americans have integrated very well into American society. My mother first came to this country at the age of 25. She got a job at Woolworth's lunch counter, and made really good American comfort food. Also, she made lots of friends with non-Greek-American neighbors. One of the first coffee-klatsch offerings she learned to make when her friends came over was Bundt cake---which is why the scene where with the Bundt cake is so stupid. I never heard any Greek-American refer to Americans of other ancestries as a ""xeno"" (foreigner). More often, I would hear them refer those of other ancestries as ""Americans""--as if the Greek-Americans were foreigners--which they were not. The American military cemeteries all over the world all contain an above-proportional share of gravemarkers with Greek surnames on them.If you want to learn something of what Greek-Americans add to the American mosaic, watch Elia Kazan's America, America. As an American of Greek ancestry, what I carry proudly from my Greek heritage are things like the Greek people saying OXI (No) to Mussolini's ultimatum in 1940 at a time when other small nations were looking to get out of the Nazi/Fascist war machines' way. That event hearkens back to Thermopylae where 300 Greek blocked a narrow mountain pass and made the taking of it so costly to the invading army that the rest of the Greek armies regrouped to win the main battle. To analogize to an overused scene from a Western, Greeks are the little guys in the saloon who, when the bad men come in, and everyone runs out of their way, politely refuse any intimidating demands. They may lose, and they may get killed, but they will not stand down. Greeks historically choose right over wrong, even when wrong is very convenient. E.g. Greeks, during both World Wars, would never co-operate with Nazis just because they may have a gripe against the British. The Greek instinctively knows that Greece's allies always marginalize and ignore Greece's concerns after the war is over; nonetheless, they will choose the side of right over might--any day. The people depicted in this film are people whose crass materialism masquerades as ethnic pride, unconsciously exaggerating their ethnicity and clannishness (or clownishness) to make up for how far from Greek values they have strayed. The Italian movie Mediteranneo had a far better appreciation of Greek character and culture than this movie. But if you think of this movie as a farce about a subculture of nouveau riche in America,then by all means watch and promote this film to others.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
274,Spiner-2,Too bad I only have two thumbs to put up! (minor spoilers),10,13 September 2002,"This is one of the two best independent films I've ever seen. (""Brigham City"" is the other.) ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is about Fotoula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), a Greek-American woman who is insecure about her looks and embarrassed by her family's overpowering... Greekness? Greekiness? Greekosity? Well, they're VERY Greek. She meets and falls in love with Ian Miller (John Corbett, ""Serendipity""), but keeps the relationship a secret, knowing that her father would disapprove. Why? Because he's... GASP!... not Greek.Vardalos, who also wrote the story (originally as a one-woman play) does an excellent job in her portrayal of Toula. Anyone who has harbored major insecurities about one's self will immediately sympathize with her character. Also well-portrayed was Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine), Toula's father, who is convinced that everything of value (and all words) are Greek in origin, and that Windex cures all ills. (I was waiting for him to claim that Windex was invented by a Greek, but it never happened.)On of my favorite parts of the movie was Gus's futile attempts to convince the aged grandmother that ""the war is over"" and ""the Turks and Greeks are friends now!""There was only one negative point I could find with this film, and it's not that major, either: The film lacks the usual buildup of suspense or conflict which climaxes and is resolved near the end. The biggest conflict that arises in the film is her father's opposition to her marriage to Ian, and that gets more or less resolved around halfway through the movie. However, the film's content is good enough that the lack of a real climax to the movie is not much of a detriment.""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is just plain hilarious, and one of the few movies that I've seen recently where I left the theatre with an honest-to-goodness ""feel good"" feeling.

There are no large name actors to be seen (though there are a few familiar faces).  It has a simple script and plot.  No strong cursing, no overt sex scenes.  The writing and acting are at times a little flat, and the editing could be a little tighter.  Despite all this, the film works beautifully, due to the fact that it is so PURE.  It's hard to explain.  The gags and jokes are simple, but they are genuinely funny. Even fairly minor characters manage stand out from one another and have their own identities that connect with the audience, and remain true to themselves throughout. You can tell they are based on real people, and the script came from the experiences of a person who lived in the world portrayed. Not every scene was over-analyzed by Hollywood movie execs trying to push a formulaic movie with cut and paste supporting characters starring the latest leading lady.

A romantic comedy with an IMDb score of 6.8 is rare, so I thought I was in for a treat, but not so. Let's see what we don't get: Characterisation. The male lead is an absolute blank, we don't know any more about him when the film ends than we did the moment our heroine first lays eyes on him. The female lead is the thinnest of archetypes with a sprinkling of Greek ethnicity - unhappy with her place in life longing for change (her dream is apparently to substitute her waitress job in the family business for a job as telephone travel agent in another part of the family business), which some curlers and contacts are key ingredients in providing. The respective families are as stereotypical as you could want them.A love story. Why the happy couple are attracted to each other remains a mystery, but fair enough - love at first sight I presume. But what keeps them attracted, what do they get from each other, what do they share? Where is the passion? We don't get anything here! A plot! Nothing happens in this film - no serious obstacles, no interesting dilemmas, no twists or surprises.What you do get is ham fisted humor, which is mostly embarrassing but made me chuckle a few times and decent acting (though it can be hard to judge as the range of emotions is really small) - worth one small star each, taking this bore from one to three small stars.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Especially if you come from (or know intimately) a large ethnic family.  Considering the film has had a longer Theatrical run than some of the Star Wars films (including the current installment), I was slightly surprised to have viewed it in a packed theater six (or so) months after its initial release.All my favorite moments involve Toula's Yiayia, she really steals the show. **except for one favorite scene involving 'Ian' and a picture window.**And for those of you interested, the word 'movie' comes from the Greek word. . .",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

What bothered me the most was the one dimensional treatment given to Ian and his parents. Their characters had almost no style, and very little substance. This movie could have been much more interesting and funnier had there been some fleshing out of Ian's character, and why he acted the way he did. There could have been much more contrast between families, therefore, more drama and more humor.Ian's parents are also given short shrift as a couple of uptight WASPs with no personality, in my opinion.Toula is a fine character, but her family is so predictable, you know how this movie will end before the beginning credits are finished.All in all, I give this noble effort a 6/10.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

In a market where getting a laugh has been reduced to predictable one-liners and raunchy site-gags, and the Romantic Comedy has been on its way to a much deserved grave, My Big Fat Greek Wedding breathes new life into these ailing genres.Though everyone who I know who has watched this movie has enjoyed it, it is those born to European parents that fell in love with it.  I found myself agape at the similarities between the Portokalos family and my own.  Not only the strict old-school beliefs and customs, but the endearing relationships between Toula and her family.  the laugh-out-loud familiarity of their personality types had me relating to her so deeply, that i felt happy when she was happy, and mortified when she started to blush.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is an amazingly touching movie.  Showcasing the love (albeit intrusive love) of family, and the desire to balance that love with personal fulfillment.And a special treat for Canadian audiences, is the HUGE number of Canadian actors in this film - nice to see Nia Vardalos sticking to her roots in more ways than one.  :)",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

This girl waits 30 years to get married out of respect and deference to her parents and family, but can't wait a few weeks to have sex until after she's married? I'm sorry, but this was completely out of character and pointless unless you buy into the same silly Hollywood notions that result in 15 day Hollywood marriages.I could get past the drinking and the language and some of the other stuff, because I've lived near Greek-town in Chicago. I've known the folks. That's real. The struggle Tula has with her father & mother, respect, her characterization of what is expected of her... all real. Her eventual defiance of the parents to get married, very real, and similar in Chinatown, the Jewish neighborhoods, or any other tight-knit ethnic community near Chicago.But premarital sex, from her character, in that neighborhood... no way.Regardless...

I cared about the characters until then and cared about how the conflict surrounding their relationship and wedding was going to be resolved. But once it was resolved, there was nothing left to engage the viewer. Not only that, somehow the main characters then drifted off into the background and were lost behind the fairly boring, clichéd and uninspired depiction of the ""Greek wedding"" itself.

Then I thought ""oh well, that's a family living in usa"". And it's quite true, being away from home, makes all these cultural characteristics stronger, wanting them never to leave your life. I believe an american, canadian, british, german, italian or whatever family would have similar behaviour over local customs living on a distant land. So, I pushed back my personal feelings about ""giving a bad name to greeks""(because they were wrong) and watched the rest of the movie.It's a nice movie I would put in the genre of ""ethnic comedies"". An ethnic movie, not because it's about a greek family, but because it's about a greek family speaking english:)It's funny, it's about love and caring, about cultural differences and how to overcome them.

Ok, there are a few funny moments, but the characters are very cliché and we all had the feeling that we had seen the movie hundreds of times before. There was only one way how we could review it (sorry): too American and not Greek enough... To me it looked more like some silly money-making blockbuster, rather the work of an artist with a view and something to say (the moral was so plain and childish I felt offended !).

Well a few things about the movie, it does get on people's nerves at first with Toula saying all kinds of stupid things (and in the end if someone does not like where they are from i suppose they can just as easily migrate -just as a friend of mine did cause he was embarrased to be a Helen). On the other hand, the movie delivers some funny momments, the interest is entirely stolen by Toula's father who really plays 100% what it would be expected from him. Note (minor spoiler) the scene where the american parents go over to meet the hellenic family for the first time and they bring along a cake. I suppose it is the funniest moment of the movie, specially if you can understand hellenic.well all in all i am giving this movie a 5. note this is the second time i am rating it, the first time i gave it a 2.

297,pourleschiens,this is sparta?,6,24 October 2007,"A very likable little movie, leaves one smiling throughout (for the most part) and creates characters and situations we care about. It's an interesting setting for the usual romantic comedy stuff, because Greeks in America really are a world unto themselves, and their lives and communities, and all the delightful members of these wonderful families, are too rarely depicted in major films- even this wasn't a major film but became one by good word of mouth. So I was glad to see these people and this family in a movie. Less successful are Ian's parents, who I thought were treated unfairly- their scenes were so unpleasant they nearly stopped the movie cold- and Ian himself was a cipher, so perhaps Nia Vardalos has trouble writing non-Greeks. Still, she wrote a very heartfelt and charming movie about an experience neglected by movies generally, so it's hard to fault her too much. Film is rarely so corny as it might have been, another tribute to Vardalos. Her voice-over narration didn't work, however- it played like a bad stand-up act on the subject- and I was glad it wasn't in much of the movie. Overall, it's a good-natured film, a tried-and-true form but with a novel and interesting setting and cast of characters, and made with great love.

I had heard it was funny, but at the same time that it had lessons to teach about life, love and culture. i thought this movie was mediocre, but definatley worth watching.

The movie was nothing near as funny as the reviews had told. While it was cleaner and more wholesome than most comedies of late, it's biggest virtue, it was also quite slow and boring, worth seeing once, but not again.

302,prairiebird,Reminds Me of my Mexican Family,9,26 February 2019,"Big Fat Greek Wedding is something I return to often. I watch it a few times a year, preferably on a rainy day. The stereotype of loud and boisterous Greeks is in full force in this movie, and to me that is charming. It absolutely reminds me of my own family. Tula herself reminds me of my aunt, Gus reminds me of my grandfather, and Tula's aunts remind me of my great-aunts. And the fact that Tula has more cousins than she can count is something I know all too well about. I'm sure lots of other people, regardless of being Greek, Mexican, or anything else, have felt the same way about this movie. The desire for Tula to marry a Greek boy echoes many other cultures wishing that their daughters would marry someone of the same culture. Overall, this movie is light-hearted and relatable. The scene between Tula, her mother, and her grandmother before her wedding was very sweet.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

The only people in the theater who enjoyed the repetitious, heavy-handed ethic self-deprecation seemed to be the big Greek families seeing the movie together. The storyline did at least move along, and didn't present conflict and resolution in a predictable Hollywood screenwriter fashion. To me it seemed a slice of life, albeit a tiresome one. It did delight my girlfriend.  Change a few personal names, change actors and the script could have been about Italians, Koreans, or Cubans. I was surprised a one-note wonder made it to the multiplex, I would have expected this to be seen at a less-inspiring night at the Miramax screen.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Being Italian (i.e. not quite Greek) and first generation Australian (i.e. not quite American), I could identify with the main character very much. So it is with clear insight that I make a comparison between this film and a documentary. Much like Monsoon Wedding, this film celebrates the chaos and love in a family in which one their daughters is to be married. Being a migrant family, though, it has the added factor of cultural comparisons, and the pressures on each generation to follow tradition, whilst still satisfying the need to take advantage of new oportunities and make progress. A most enjoyable film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Plain, downtrodden daughter turns into beautiful, blushing bride.  That's about it.  No plot, no humour, no drama.The lead character's closing line goes something like ""I've learnt some stuff....."", well I too have learnt some 'stuff'.  Don't pay to see this film.

310,nhoney1,Noisy and chaotic does not a comedy make,7,14 November 2002,"This film is a celebration of the Greek family and it is successful in doing this. But while watching a large family, full of quirky characters, with noisy and chaotic interactions, can be enjoyable, amusing, and even funny at times, it does not, in itself, make for much of a comedy.The main problem is a lack of dramatic tension. There is a small amount in the transformation of Toula from restaurant drudge to attractive travel agent, which did involve a funny scene, but that piece of comedy was soon over. Toula and Ian got on well from the beginning. This is more natural and original than the standard romantic comedy, where girl meets boy, they either hate each other at first sight or for some other reason can't be together, and at the very end they manage to get together after all. This is completely unoriginal, but, and I cringe to write this, it does create some dramatic tension which can let the comedy work.Ian is always accepting of Toula's Greek heritage, so there is only a small amount of humour in his being an outsider. By the time Toula's father finds out about Ian, the couple's relationship is solid, so there is minimal opportunity for conflict and the development of comedy. There is some comedy in the contrast between Toula's and Ian's families, but his parents are peripheral to the story, so the amount of humour that could be generated was minor.The film is a portrayal of a large, close-knit, family, for the audience to enjoy and laugh at. But there is limited humour in the plot, or even the two main characters, and so ultimately it is limited in its success as a comedy.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Rather than try a TV show, the real franchise value here seems to be dumb humor around racial and social stereotyping.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
312,leybman,How Good Simplicity Is!,7,19 July 2002,"The story goes that Nia Vardalos, who plays Toula, wrote a play. Immediately Rita Wilson, a Greek-American herself, who convinced her husband to produce the movie version, saw the play. Her husband of course is Tom Hanks. And yet what a movie. The question you ask before the movie is will it touch you? I saw it in a little independent theatre in St. Louis on a nice day. I was looking for something and this seemed to be a nice way to spend some time. There is a plot in the movie, obviously. It concerns the development and blossoming of Toula into an attractive woman who falls for (Sex and the City's) John Corbett. He plays in this movie a vegetarian high school teacher Ian Miller. And its only the beginning. Like in all conservative cultures, expectations are made. One sometimes fills them, sometimes doesn't Especially hard is it on a woman grown in a different culture trying to abide by a distant one imposed on her family. Is anything more universal?In this movie, the obvious desire by Toula's large family is simple: Marry a Greek, have lots of kids with a Greek, and serve them until you die. And yet she wants more. She has grown up in a culture with more liberal leanings. No longer is Toula required to be a homemaker, now there is something else that she can accomplish. Maybe be a nurse, a doctor, a lawyer, an accounting: In the movie she gets a job from a relative as a travel agent's assistant.Toula, played by Nia Vardalos, is the most important character for the movie's survival. She carries the movie with her lines and voice-over narration. Nia was right to let herself play the leading role. This movie is fiction only as far the main events, but in the details (God is in the Details?) I am pretty sure all of it is true. John Corbett's Ian Miller appears and the movie rolls in. There is Toula's fear of being disowned for not marrying a Greek. There are the jokes and idiosyncrasies of the family (Windex, anyone.) And there are others. The movie is simple and yet is effective in parts. It does lose pace sometimes trying to go for the ""lecture"" or ""lesson"" and it is here that it fails miserably: No lectures are needed. The audiences see that Love, at least in this movie, is not cultural. It is a universal concept that cannot be hid in a healthy manner. Sometimes in comedies, even in this one, there is a need to sentimentalize. Does it work? Sometimes. Most times all it does is break the pace of the story. The audience I saw it was lost with couple of speeches and couldn't wait to get with the laughter.What does this movie accomplish? Nothing grand. It is not a complex movie and in an hour or so the hangover will be over. You will remember the movie as a nice way to spend some time. Despite it intentions of actually being a careful and accurate portrait of a Greek family, it failed because it was a comedy. Pure comedies can never be authentic because their key ingredient is ""exaggeration,"" a poison to truth. And yet nevertheless, this movie does feel good. You can get drunk on it and recommend it to friends. Needless to say, the movie ends on a positive note with a last laugh as the camera pans away to reveal their house and who it is by....",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

The ""daughter of immigrant parents who want their daughter to marry within their race"" movie is nothing new, and the only thing that seems to differentiate it from others is that these people were Greek.  Instead of watching a disapproving Chinese father come to terms with his child's choice, it was a disapproving Greek father.Not that every movie has to be something new, but I didn't really feel the connection with the main character Toula.  She goes from thirty years of frumpiness to fashionable woman faster than seems realistically possible. To me her character didn't seem very realistic at all.  After that realization, there really wasn't any reason for me to watch the movie.

The depiction of Greek families living in 21st century America... I'm not Greek and I'm offended.There is no way to provide any spoilers, as the entire plot of the movie is contained in the title.  Everything is predictable and trite.  The movie has the substance of a Hostess Twinkie.

How he was not at least recommended for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is beyond my comprehension. He was brilliant!

I was always in disagreement with Tevye, when he sang "" Tradition, "" in "" Fiddler On The Roof. "" To me tradition, in any religion or culture, is one of the greatest pitfalls to progress. When Gibran wrote in "" The Prophet "" that children are not ours, instead "" they come through us, "" I was in complete accord with his way of thinking. When Gus finally came around & welcomed Ian Miller to the extended family, that was when I said to myself, "" It's about time.

Yes, the non-Greek boyfriend is a little too cute, clean, nice, conforming, etc.  But the story works in the sense that it reminds us all that rather than run from our families (and I don't just mean nationality), we should embrace our heritage and family quirks as part of what makes us who we are.

It didn't make any significant impact on me, in a few months I will probably only vaguely remember it, but it made for a very enjoyable evening.I don't like romantic comedies, I want to make it clear. Unless they are truly funny and the characters have actual personalities, which, in translation, means that British romantic comedies are mostly OK. The fact, that they have pretty accents there, helps a lot, too. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is not a typical American romantic comedy (it was written by a Greek woman, after all). Thank God, because otherwise it would be 100 plus minutes of pain.Let's recap a plot of a typical American romantic comedy. A man and a woman meet, usually under some extraordinary circumstances. The sparks fly. They can't really fight off the unexpected (*snort*} attraction towards one another, however hard they try. Their so far empty lives suddenly are filled with joy, happiness and general beauty, but they are not aware yet of the source of this wondrous transformation. Then a tragic misunderstanding / a dramatic turn of fate takes place. They break up / are torn apart. The joy, happiness and general beauty disappear without giving any notice. The man and the woman wallow in misery. Then the enlightenment strikes. They are in love! They can't live without his/her beloved! They have to get them back! After overcoming a lot of obstacles on the way, they finally meet again. The misunderstandings are understood / Lady Fortune turns out not to be such a bitch after all. A passionate PG-rated kiss occurs. They live happily ever after.In 'Big Fat Greek Wedding' a man and a woman meet, the sparks fly. They fall in love with each other and, after some time, decide to get married. Then... they get married. They live happily ever after. The End.That's usually how these thing work. No great tragedies, no needless drama. Just an ordinary love story.Actually, the romantic plot doesn't even play the main role here. It's more of a catalyst. The first half of the movie, when the love in question takes shape, is pretty uninteresting and not so funny. It just introduces the players, establishes the setting for the main event. The main event being an exhilarating spectacle of cultural eccentricities.Toula and Ian love each other, deeply, unreservedly and happily. We are glad for them, since they are both very likable. Then we stop paying attention to them. There's something much more exciting to watch. Namely, how Toula's extremely weird, but lovable, family reacts to their unanticipated togetherness. They strongly disapprove at first, but we don't really mind, because we know that they will cave soon. They do. Hostility suddenly turns into freakish enthusiasm, and hilarity ensues. The movie gains speed, colour and bite. Some scenes are simply fabulous: the Easter party, Toula'a family welcoming Ian's parents for a dinner, pre-wedding frantic preparations. Priceless.The movie makes fun from cultural fanaticism and stereotypes, but in a very subtle and unoffensive way. It tells us about the importance of inter-cultural peaceful coexistence, but without preaching. All right, without unduly preaching. And it really makes you laugh out loud at times.

It just goes to show you that you don't need 50 or a 100 million dollars to make a entertaining movie. With that said, I thought this movie was just good, not great, and not all that funny. Being from an Italian American family, I can honestly say nothing in this film is new to me or has not happened in my family. Some of the jokes where over done, and to me it got a little boring. I was waiting for something to happen, that would really make this film great, and I thought it would come in the wedding scene. But over all, I very happy for the writer and the film makers.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Ian and Toula just overall want to be happy and in love, which Ian's family does not mind, but Toula's family objects to just because Ian isn't Greek. This is something not seen as much or rather as frequently in society depending on where you live, but it does still happen. Ian and Toula are not that different, their cultures might be, but that should not and does not stop them from being together.This is by far my favorite family movie, and has something for everyone to laugh at.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Then, one day she meets the man of her dreams. They fall in love, and then decide to get married. But there's one problem: keeping her wacky Greek family away. You should really see this movie. It's been out for 6 months already, and it's making more money each week, pretty good for an indie movie.

This movie was simply enjoyable and entertaining right from the get go, and I am not exaggerating when I say this is the most I've laughed in the movies in years!If you enjoy ethnic humor and a truly nice story that will touch your heart, then go see and enjoy this movie.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

As Americans, we should all feel that family means everything to us.  Sure, there are disagreements and misunderstandings in every family, but family is forever -- Greek, Hispanic, Cajun, African-American or whatever the heritage.It's great to see John Corbett in something where he is the leading man, a really FINE man.  Nia Vardalos was wonderful.  I was especially impressed with Andrea Martin as the aunt.This movie rates a 10 in our books.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

353,be_leafer,Reasonably enjoyable,6,30 September 2002,"If you're Greek, you'll enjoy this movie.  I watched with several Greeks (they understood the Greek dialogue) and they were laughing uproariously throughout; that was fun to see.  There were light laughs for me, but the movie was full of cliches - homely girl and cute guy, quirky father, stolid white-bread parents, etc. - and hardly any attempt to delve into what motivates the characters - what exactly is the attraction between the two, for instance?  But, overall, it was reasonably enjoyable.
P.S. This movie was shot in Toronto which has a vibrant Greek community (Pappas Grill, one of my favourite restaurants, can be seen in some background shots) - I wish they'd had the balls to actually place it there instead of pretending that it's Chicago - maybe one day.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It's the simple movies, the ones from the heart that are the best and this one is one of 'em. OK so it may be dubbed a 'chick flick' but I think guys will appreciate the humor since a lot of it revolves around what they endure in the pursuit of love. Wonderfully endearing, funny as all get out, and well written and acted. Kudos to all and thank you Tom and Rita for producing this to the big screen! We love it!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Sleeping had been a better option: The jokes in the movie are predictable, the running gag in it simply not funny and I cannot recognize a line or story in it. The whole story plays at one location and the actors are very cheap so it must be a cheap budget. But I'll think the makers already knew they made crap with this script.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I have been a great fan of John Corbett since Northern Exposure and enjoyed seeing him in a great movie.    The whole movie reminded me of ""Moonstruck"" and all it's zaniness.    I hope it gets in the Oscar nominations for Best Picture. It deserves it.    Also John Constatine was brilliant as the father.   He's always played dramatic roles and was great as the Greek/Windex-using father.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
358,resto,bland and clichéd,4,9 May 2003,"Bland and clichéd, this is an annoying film about what could have been a great story. Sadly, the makers abandoned any attempts at an edgier look at immigrant life and turned it into a soppy crowd pleaser of a feeble romantic comedy. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it feels like a missed chance to greater things. Check out the TV series spin-off for an even less challenging approach to the lowest common denominator of audience tastes.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
359,grisez,Not an exceptional film,4,12 May 2003,"Reviews had led us to expect a great deal of this film. My wife and I were disappointed, and found it only mediocre--not one of the better films we've seen, but not as bad as many others that are highly rated.The plot is simple, hardly ingenious, and by no means original. The characters are not developed with depth, and most are drawn as caricatures for comic effect. One unfortunate result is that the main character, who tells the story, seems to be ridiculing both her parents and, in a couple of scenes, Greek Orthodox religious practices. The direction and acting are not bad, but not especially good either. The photography and music are above average but not worthy of any award.About thirty years ago, my wife and I saw ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" a very similar plot, beautifully written and carried off by great performers: Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, Katherine Houghton, and Sidney Poitier. That film was far more respectful of the parents but at the same time far funnier. On the 10 scale, we'd have rated it 9. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding "" is not half as good. We give it a 4.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

You would feel comfortable among them.The story is simple and everything seems genuine.

A nice feel good movie but I think it was nearly ruined by the parents of the groom.There acting is is like acting from a school play! It is such lazy story writing, the W.A.S.P. parents are cold, ignorant and frightened of other cultures! Yet their son is intelligent, very well educated and open-minded and it really seems like they have never even met. It is such a shame that in a movie about the inner workings of family that the movie makers got a bit bored and tired before managing to develop all of the main characters. I think the male lead's ""likeability"" and cuteness carry's this movie and of course the Greek Mammy! :) Saying that,it's very enjoyable very sweet and reminds me of movies in the 80's.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
362,rbod,Nothing new here,5,18 May 2005,"I can't figure out why so many people liked this film AS MUCH as they did. Yes it was stereotypical, that cannot be avoided. The art, which is lacking, is in making it less predictable. Not only was it predictable but there are times when it became so episodic that it fell flat--towards the end when the couple are about to be married I thought it would bring things together, create some interest, make something happen. Nothing happened. They got married without a hitch, everyone lived happily ever after. No awkward moments, no signs of insight or growth. Comedy has to work a lot harder than that to merit a happy ending. The character of the groom was especially troubling as he seemed not to have been given a personality--just a persona, i.e. the one who loves. Give me Renee Taylor any day in Made for each other, or Lovers and other strangers for ethnic humor, with substance! And real laughs. P.S. Love Lainie Kazan.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
363,dsmithkent,Real Gut-Buster,9,23 July 2002,"One of those really cute, happy ending sappy movies, but it very well avoids being cheesy.  This is about two different cultures coming together for Love.  A very overly used concept in movies (kind of a toned down Jungle Fever.)  However this one is different than most because there are no threats of anyone being disowned or banished from their family or race. It's simply the story of two people from different backgrounds coming together.  Discovering another culture is always shocking and that is what is so funny about this movie. There are very funny scenes of families coming together.  Seeing the WASPy millers meet the very large Portokalos family are great.John Corbett (Aidan from SATC) is great is Ian Miller and Michael Constantine is great as Gus the Greek father who is so very proud of his heritage.  This movie over does many aspects of the Greek lifestyle for dramatical purposes, but overall makes light of that culture without being offensive.  I had just gone to my first Greek wedding a week before seeing this movie, and that made it all the better.  Definitely worth seeing.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
364,Mike Richards,My Big Fat Greek Wedding = Big Fun!,8,18 August 2002,"I won't say too much, since there is about 150 thread ahead of this one. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is big fun.  I laughed out loud many times during this wonderful film. The acting is great. Nia Vardalos (Toula) and John Corbett (Ian) are spirited in their roles. Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as the parents are very good. Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula is hilarious. I think everybody has an aunt like that somewhere in their family. Gia Carides is also funny as cousin Nikki.  Go see this movie.  Nothing blows up. There is no foul language and no gratuitous sex here, just lots of laughs with a real nice story line. I read recently that Nia Vardalos held out on having this movie made until she could get it done, with the Greek story line.  At one point an offer was made to her to make the film and switch the family background to Italian and have Marisa Tomei play the lead. I'm glad and not surprised that Nia held out until the movie was made the way it should have been. You see, she's from my home town, Winnipeg. :) I look forward to her next project.

This is the worst movie I have seen since Save the Last Dance, and at least we could laugh AT that.

367,mike94109,A BIG Thumbs Up!,9,2 May 2002,"Two minutes into this movie and I had a smile on my face.  It remained there throughout the entire picture along with many big belly laughs and a few moments that, for a guy, made my eyes fill up with tears.Tula is a Greek girl now 30 and unmarried.  Her family is driving her nuts, especially her father (Michael Constantine), about finding a man.  One day she meets Ian (John Corbett of Sex & the City and Northern Exposure) when he comes into the family restaurant.  It is apparent she finds this guy attractive.  They don't meet again until she goes to work for her aunt's (Andrea Martin of Second City TV.  She is well known on SCTV as ""Edith Prickley"") Travel agency.  Ian walks by, sees her, and they fall in love.She's Greek, he isn't and her family wants and expects her to marry a Greek. That's when all the real fun begins.  I laughed hard because all these people are somewhat real - you've probably met them in real life. Lainie Kazan plays the mother perfectly.  Joey Fatone (of 'N Sync) does a fine job as a funny cousin!I won't spoil the end for you but all the antics are funny, there are charming and very moving moments like when Ian and Tula are in bed together and Ian asks her to marry him and the wedding gift from the parents made me cry.  There are very funny sibling moments: Tula's brother Nicky keeps giving Ian bad language phrases for simple things like, ""how do I say thank you?"" (Nicky gives him a greek phrase which turns out to say ""big boobs""). In another instance Ian wants to thank the entire Greek family for coming to the engagement party.  Nicky gives him a phrase but Ian doesn't trust him so he asks Angelo (Joey Fatone).  Angelo gives him the same phrase Nicky offered and it turns out to really say: ""I've got three testicles!""  The look on the faces of the entire family is priceless.  They pause sober-faced and look at one another then burst into smiles and applause because Greeks believe in very large families and surely Ian will father many children with three testicles!  It is soooo funny!Ian is hunky and handsome, Tula is frumpy but turns into a beautiful Greek swan, family hilarious and the wedding is huge.  In the wedding scene it is a custom in the Greek tradition to spit (not really, just a 'pa-tooey' kind of thing) on a person for good luck - the entire huge family spits on Tula as she walks down the isle and it is uproarious!I HIGHLY recommend this movie for mid-teens and above.  Very funny, the end is sweet as hell, and you walk out feeling very good.  You won't forget this movie and you keep recalling the funny scenes.The girl who plays Tula is not a well known actress (although she will be from now on) and she wrote the screen and stage play, a play she had been performing for a few years before turning it into a movie.  She did a marvelous job and the jokes are honed and very well done and timed.It is a charmer! TWO THUMBS UP!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I can't imagine anyone more boring than this guy. And his association with her doesn't lead to him become any more interesting as the film progresses.Her Greek family is so stereotyped, they mostly all come off as idiots. Real humor needs to be based on the humanity of the characters. The only human one in the bunch, besides the daughter, is her mother (played by Lainie Kazan). The father is a stereotyped, nondimensional nut case, and the aunt (I forget her name but she's from SCTV) was also portrayed as a stereotyped nut.I wanted to walk out, but kept my seat hoping things would improve (e.g., that she would see what a boring loser her fiance was, and go find herself a nice, passionate Greek boyfriend).

372,mariomguy,As Exaggerated as it is True!,10,29 January 2012,"I can see how the appeal of this movie might wane for some, with much of the comedy about clashing cultures and large-scale sociology than any personal conflicts. The writing being this film's strong point, anyone missing out on the culture clash will miss out on a lot the film has to offer. Everything on screen (as any foreign-family-American can attest) is absolutely true!A Greek woman meets a great guy, but that's not the point. It's about the family. Stereotyped or not, what we get are a lot of loud cousins who eat meat that try to invite the toast family with food. A lot of food. A LOT of lamb, and a LOT of food. Food. The family owns a restaurant, so there's always food. And it's about family reunions and a wedding, so, more food. Oh, and it's about Greeks, so FOOD FOOD FOOD!Take any scene, any quote from this movie, reference it to any Greek person alive, and they will laugh and respond with the rest of the script. That is the point of this film. It's not an epic fantasy about a princess and a dragon and an army of knights, nor is it an action thriller. It's about food, and Greeks and food. For many of us, it's a film called ""life."" It might not be your life, but it is for us! And you know what? Our life is funny!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

The big glasses, the frumpy hair. I loved how she became so much more confident after getting a ""makeover"" and yet she never wore anything too revealing. I also liked how she made John wait so long for anything more then a kiss!One of my favorite scenes is when Toula is getting ready for the wedding and all the women in her family are chasing after her and plucking hairs off her chin.

379,kurdishcinema,Such a nice and entertaining movie,9,3 September 2006,"This is a such a nice and entertaining movie. As in David & Layla directed by Jalal Jonroy, My big fat Greek Wedding too celebrates the love and cultural differences. Love, humanism, comedy, romance all are in that great film. My Big Fat Greek Weddeing brings people from different background closer and shows how important to accept the 'other' as other in order to be just happy! Being a migrant poses different problems and the individuals some times have to defy their original traditions and cultures to be able to love or be happy. In particular Greeks are very keen on and proud of their traditions and cultures (rightfully). I like the films which provide some insight and understanding of different cultures, or of individuals inner world. In this term My Big Fat Greeek Wedding does the job. That is why it is a very captivating film along with being funny enough to make you laugh even after you left the movie theater.

I'd have to admit that my family is Argentine-Italian by nature but I saw so many images of my life and felt represented so many times that I could not deny how universal and human the movie is. While I laughed so hard as I couldn't remember I was also taken to many deep places in my heart and mind. I was reminded how overwheelming can my family be and how much they care for me at the same time. I was surprised at how similar the Greek and Italian 'peccadilloes' were and discovered how human we all are after all. In a time where we spend most of the time learning about each other just to find an excuse to hate more it is definetely a garden of rest a movie which shows how silly and wonderfull we all are and what a good time we can all have.

There was no way that a movie that had this much good word of mouth could be anything but a lovely, endearing film. I was so wrong. I sat and watched a movie in a packed theater at 10 pm on a Friday with a crowd of brainwashed, middle-aged simpletons. Watching in horror as everyone laughed at formulaic plot, unfunny and recycled jokes, and one of the sappiest love stories, I continued in hope for a saving moment. There was none. I will concede that the film had small sparks of wit intertwined with the ethnicity of the script. But in no way was this the movie that I had been hearing about whenever I turned on the TV or that has been praised on Oprah. This film is the perfect example of great timing. Released in a season where there wasn't a single great movie, it hit the right socio-economic group, a ethic group that is large and not talked about in movies, (you're trying to tell me that this couldn't be called My Big Fat Italian Wedding?) and appealed to every woman's (who dragged their significant other along) senses. This movie was cute. Nothing more, and for the critical praise and box office success this movie received, it was a a huge disappointment.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Excellent movie!I don't agree with the comments that no Greek family is like the one in the film. Being a Greek, and a native one, I recognized in the film characters from my own family, lines that I have already heard during a family gathering, an atmosphere that I have been living with all these years.Go see this movie and take along your parents. An italian friend told me that this movie would very well be the story of an italian family if you would only change some lines and scenery. An Irish woman told Nia Vardalos (after she saw the play in the theater) that she was very touched because in the story she ""saw"" her own Irish family!!Family togetherness is a universal value either if you are Greek or Italian or American. The comedy element works perfectly in this movie and, at the end, the result is very entertaining.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

385,MartiniOlive,Over-rated Trash,1,22 February 2003,"The hype for this film has inflated its reputation to ridiculous proportions.  The story is cliched, the characters are stereotypical, and the humor is far less ""hit"" than ""miss"".  The entire story plays in a shallow, two dimensional manner that leaves the viewer feeling like they just watched a mediocre sitcom.  John Corbett is shaggy, smiley, and incredibly vapid.  Nia Vardalos brings nothing but the fact that she's Greek to this overdone ugly-duckling story.  To their credit, Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin, and Michael Constantine elicit a few chuckles, though they are restricted by their one-trick-pony characters.  As a whole, I was entirely unimpressed by this bland, over-hyped schlock.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

While it seemed like we were the only people in the theatre that found a few things funny, the crowd for the majority liked it. I thought that the humor was good and not offensive at all, which is always a concern with ethnic comedy. Lainie Kazan was great as the mother, and I think she and Nia Vardalos are good proof that women don't need to be skinny, busty, and blonde to be really beautiful women. It's a good mature movie.

388,victorbertocco,"This film is funny, but there is a distorted view in it!",7,24 March 2020,"With a production that began in 2000 in Canada and ended in 2002, the ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was directed by Joel Zwick and written by Nia Vardalos (Tula), the protagonist of the film. This romantic comedy generated, in a short time, a large number of different repercussions.This woman, Tula, feels lonely and sad for living without someone who understands her, living repressed and always having her dreams blocked by her parents' extremisms, related to the way they see the world. For these (parents), Greek culture refers to superiority.This visual production begins with lively music, with aspects of Greek culture, which makes the receiver anxious about what is to come. Soon after, he presents the scene of such family, and Tula's childhood, which differs greatly from people of her age. Based on that, the film demonstrates an aspect that is seen all over the world: prejudice. Tula, having different habits, has difficulties in creating friendships, making friends.The film also portrayed a very common social problem: patriarchy. Tula's father is the one who decides the direction of the family, which ends up creating an expectation about the change in his posture, in allowing greater freedom for the members of his family.However, this family wasn't represented impartially. In much of the film, aspects of this culture, represented mainly by Tula's father, have been distorted, to the point that the receiver thinks that the habits of the Greeks are relatively innocents and wild, or that the behavior of the Americans corresponds to normality, a factor that makes the movie ""funny"" and at the same time with partial judgments. But the film, at a certain moment, passes another view, that each one presents its differences, but that each one must be seen in the same way. This gives a tone of contradiction because there is a confrontation of ideas.The film, moreover, includes characters who should have a greater impact on the plot, such as Ian's parents. Parents always have a great influence on their children, but in this case, they aren't so participative in the story. This passivity doesn't correspond to the actual form of action of parents in the lives of childrenIn general, the movie has an accessible language for several younger age groups, besides having scenes that lead to laughter and systemize a certain anxiety of what it's coming. This work, as it presents pertinent concepts of human reality, is also recommended to the elderly people. However, some aspects of the story exposed can be improved, such as the distorted view presented which is soon contradicted, and issues of the plot.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I didn't care for him as ""Lars"" in Serendipity (with John Cusak), but he successfully played ""Ian"" as the smitten, mushy, eager-to-please  romantic.I wanted to strangle Michael Constantine through the whole movie, but at the same time, he made me laugh hysterically.I loved Louis Mandylor as the brother. I thought he played his character in ""...Greek Wedding"" very honestly. I really felt like ""Nick"" was someone who could I could see living down the street, working on his car.Overall, while this movie will most likely not be recognized by the Academy, I still highly recommend it for a good laugh.

393,eviljanet,"First cute, feel-good movie of the summer",9,27 August 2002,"Alright. I admit it. I really didn't want to see this movie. Why didn't I want to see it? First, because my mother kept pestering me about it. I would always make up excuses (""cough, cough, I'm sick,"" etc). So, she eventually wound up seeing it with my aunt (her sister). She enjoyed it and made me feel bad for not wanting to see it with her. The second reason I didn't want to see it is because Joey Fatone (from N'Sync) is in it. I had suspicions that they cast him not because of his acting abilities, but because of N'Sync's huge fan base of rabid pre-teen girls who would flock to the theaters to see him. Third, I just didn't think I would enjoy it much.Well, yesterday, my friend Cathy and I decided to go to the movies, since we had nothing better to do. We were in the mood to see a good chick flick, so we went to see 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'.I must say, I was pleasantly surprised that I was totally wrong about the film. Sure, there were a lot of ethnic jokes, but they were all in good taste...and yes, the whole family acted a little old fashioned when it came to her (Toula's) choice of a husband, which I found a little far-fetched in this day and age. I mean, even my grandparents who are in their 70's (God bless them) and grew up in very traditional families that immigrated from Mexico, wouldn't/don't care about the ethnic background of any of their grandchildren's choice of mate. But I looked past those flaws. If the family were more accepting of non-Greeks, the movie would've been flat.What did I love about this movie? The way Toula and Ian met: by making complete fools out of themselves. The huge lawn party for Toula and Ian's families to meet for the first time, complete with lambs roasting on a spit, much to Ian's parent's horror. Classic.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did my friend Cathy. At one point in the movie (hint: old lady ass-kicking), I had tears coming out of my eyes from laughing so hard. So if you're tired of the regurgitated action movies ('Men In Black II') and if you're in the mood for light-hearted, feel-good comedy, I suggest you see 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

There have been so few Hollywood-type films for mature and intelligent people this year, that ""MBFGW"", attracted    those who rarely go to the movies, upon the recommendation of their friends and family.

395,PauseDotCom,"Funny, funny movie that will make you want to see more!",9,13 May 2002,"Relative newcomer-actress and Second City alum Nia Vardalos has written what has got to be the funniest movie since 2000's ""Best in Show"". 'Greek Wedding' is funny from its first moments, showing the agony of Vardalos' character, Toula Portokalos, growing up in the shadow of older, prettier sister Athena (Stavroula Logothettis).Now at 30, Toula is determined not just to marry Greek for the sake of getting married. Instead, she takes courses in computers to be able to get away from the family restaurant and work at her Aunt Voula's (Andrea Martin) travel agency.While there, Toula begins a romance with laid-back, non-ethnic Ian Miller (John Corbett), who is about as whitebread as he could be without being a quarterback for some obscure Iowa college. It's the clash of the Titanic Portokalos family against the Millers that is the setup for many of the film's jokes, but it's Vardalos' witty and often subtle writing that makes this a truly sweet and entertaining film, and not just another ""wacky hijinx at the wedding"" movie.There are no falling into cake gags, or misunderstandings where suspicious newlyweds-to-be find their betrothed with another. No, Vardalos has given us a genuine and well-crafted look into one family's ethnicity-based views on love, marriage and, of course, being Greek.There are two kinds of screenwriters who write movies about weddings: Those who write movies like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and those who wish they could write movies like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".

397,jordanaguilar,What was all the fuss about?,5,20 February 2003,"I'll make this short. This was an average movie at best. It was a simple story with no demanding acting required. The only thing more unbelievable than the two stars getting together was the pervasive use of stereotyping to drive the comedic element of the plot. Almost as offensive as the Blacksploitation movies of the 1970s, I felt like screaming out as I was watching this movie ""I get it, guys, those misogynist, food-loving, quirky Greeks are so different than us stuck-up, snobbish WASPs!"" Also, how many times do we have to be told the Windex joke? It was funny at first, but it got old quickly and that was the only original humor in the movie. To say that this was one of the greatest Romantic Comedies of all time is an insult to movies like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Meet the Parents"". This movie, contrary to the views of another reviewer, did not make me laugh, did not make me cry, and the only thing it made me feel was upset for buying into the hype surrounding this film. I couldn't recommend this movie under any circumstances unless one wanted to see a film that didn't require any thought or intelligence.

398,Elle138,laughed a lot at this movie,10,20 April 2003,"My husband and I laughed a lot at this movie.  My son and his wife told us to go and see it when it was showing in the theatre.  Wasn't interested, but as I noticed it on the shelf at the video store, I could hear my son's voice saying ...""You'll get a good laugh at this movie!."" He was right! We both did!This movie was a change of pace from a movie with foul language in it, and the boring sex act which we see over and over again.  I am so sick and tired of this lot. Nia Vardalos may well have sent a message to the plainer women in the audience ...it's amazing what you can do for yourselves if you try hard enough! How often do we see a movie, where the plainer woman marries the handsome guy?  NEVER! Therefore I enjoyed the change.  I also liked the message Ian (John Corbett) was sending out ...that he was bored with some of the girls being thrust upon him for a date. He was looking for more than just a good looking female. He wanted someone who could hold his interest.This movie Reminded me in a way of ""Tootsie"" which educated a lot of the men out there ... that a woman who wasn't 100% goodlooking, could be just as exciting and a lot of fun to be with, and yet they are passed over by most of the male population.Women with looks like ""Nia Vardalos"" can look beautiful when they smile and this changes their whole look.  Barbra Streisand comes to mind here. Definitely not beautiful, but does at certain times, when the camera closes in on her eyes, her best feature. However, I think many men could be perfectly happy with a woman like Nia who finally made the best of herself in this movie.More than likely the movie was greatly exaggerated, but I'm sure relationships like Ian and Tula's in this instance with a Greek family do take place with other ethnic families who refuse to give up their old ways, but sometimes are forced to yield a little.My main choice when it comes to movies is seeing a ""Suspense Thriller"" but I need to laugh lot too, and for sure this movie did make me laugh.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Only when Fotoula discovers a way out of the restaurant and begins to carve out her own path, does she begin to shine and, in the process, finds true love.

The groom, Ian Miller, is played by actor John Corbett who was the radio-philosopher in the TV-series ""Northern Exposure.""Individually, or together, Fotoula and Ian duck, dance, and get decked.

Maybe people just feel good seeing a huge, eccentric loving family causing problems that aren't really problems for people who love each other for no apparent reason and without any conflict at all in their relationship. In other words, a fantasy, feel-good movie -- no sexual ambiguity, no politics, no adolescent or middle-age angst, no subtlety at all.There's nothing wrong with that, of course, and who would argue with the film's economic success?

403,Oldmancb,"Typically bad, American-movie fare.",1,27 October 2002,"SPOILER WARNING (if that's possible)My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a big, fat American-movie mess.  It is a live-action, bad joke and, like any bad joke, it is mean-spirited and not funny.  It wants you to believe it has a big heart, it doesn't.  I have a part-time job in a small store selling movies, and I am an advocate for small titles, the under-dogs of the industry.  They are where you find your best friends, your most enduring memories.  They represent what movie-making can and should be.  I have always believed that when the masses rally in favor of anything, it is time to stay far, far away.   I should have adhered to my belief.Nia Vardalos, the writer and star of this project, seems to harbor a genuine ill will towards every member of her family, and this movie has allowed her to vent her anger and make a buck or two in the process. I'm surprised that no one from the Greek community has stepped forward to voice their outrage at the portrayal of all the Greek characters in this film, including its leading lady, as loud, stupid, self-centered, inconsiderate, manipulative, purveyors of extremely bad taste.These are not well-drawn characters telling a smart little story.  Toula sees Ian, Ian sees Toula, she gives herself a drastic makeover (which no one notices), enrolls in college, (you think because Ian is there, but no), becomes a computer wiz, leaves her father's business (who knew it would be that easy?), takes over her aunt's travel agency where she is instantly gregarious (once again, who knew?), and she gets to sit at the beautiful-girl table at college (all she had to do was ask, or the popular girls only had to age 20 years and get some manners). Toula goes from being one of the most unattractive women I've seen on the screen in a long time, to being one of the most unattractive made-up, made-over women I've seen on the screen in a long time.  Early in the film, Ian says to his friend, Mike, that all the women Mike has been setting him up with `look alike', and it's a good thing Nia gives us this nugget, or we wouldn't know what the basis for their relationship was.  It's Nia doesn't look like anyone else, and that's it, and that's all.  The development of their relationship is Toula talking about her family, Toula making stupid faces at Ian, and Toula and Ian making out in Ian's car and, eventually, his apartment. And who knew becoming Greek Orthodox was as simple as a wading pool; some short, shorts; and a horny, big-haired Greek girl rubbing you down with oil. The bundt-cake bit was embarrassingly bad.  Please!!!  I not only know baklava; I can spell and pronounce it.  If Ian's squeamish, WASPy, priggish parents had also brought donuts, Toula's mother would have had a place to put her herb garden.  And Ian seems like a nice guy, so what's with the empty church on his side and the packed pews on Toula's side?  Things are only funny or sad, Nia (and Rita), if they make sense.  You could watch Monsoon Wedding for a lesson.This movie is about over-the-top, offensive, stereotypes.  It's about the flower-children of the Mediterranean showing everyone else the way with Oozo and Opa.  It's about a family that is as loveless as any I've ever seen portrayed.

404,ronindb,Not Just A Chick Flick,10,12 October 2002,"I'm not one who loves to praise movie just because others put it on a pedestal, so I'd like to honestly say that this was truly a very good movie. Of course it wasn't the best movie I had ever seen.  If there was one thing that I'd have to say detracts from it is that it's basically cut and dry. But then again, that's all subjective...some people are fine without too much conflict in the movies that they watch.  What I have to disagree with is how many people complain that they've seen the same premise and cliches in other movies, how it's not original. Originality doesn't necessarily make a movie.  It's more in how the story is told.  Look at the movie ""Memento""...you could say that the premise was taken from Dana Carvey's less-than-smash hit ""Clean Slate"" but the fact that ""Memento"" handles the story much better makes the difference.  That's what makes this film a standout.  It takes a light-hearted, humorous look into the life of a Greek Family (yes, they could have been Mexican, they could have been Italian and it wouldn't have made a difference...whatever, Nia Vardalos is Greek, so that's what she wrote).  I also think that they handle the story of Toula's transformation well.  There was no need for a life-defining moment or a death in the family for it to come about...she was unhappy with how her life was going, so she needed a change.  It happens to almost everyone at some point in their lives, and the fact that we can relate to it makes it work in the movie.

412,yildirimbusra,My opinions about the movie,7,1 November 2017,"*** This review contains spoilers ***My Big Fat Greek Wedding Review There is a big family who lives in Chicago even though they all are brought up to be strictly Greek. Father of the family is Gus which is very racist of Greek and her daughter and other members of the family are Voula, Yiayia, Maria, Nick Portokalos living the same home together. Our main character Toula Portokalas is a woman who is 30 years and not married yet. She lives in America but grows in the totally Greek family. Her father is so Greek that he can even turn 'kimono' means into Greek version. Toula has a brother and sister. Her sister is a traditional Greek woman who has many kids and a Greek husband, on the other hand, Toula hasn't. Her parents want her to marry with Greek man and has kids as far as possible like her sister, but she is little bit introverted and shy person until she meets with Ian Miller who is an American man Miller Ian. Miller Ian's life and background are a little bit different from Toula's. He has very small and separated family when I compare with the Greek family. His parents are not obsessive of racism or religion. Also, Miller does not care about Toula at the beginning of the movie because of her strange appearance and altitude but later Toula starts to be a real woman then she grabs Miller's attention. When they are together I observed that different background and lifestyle of Toula makes her attractive and irresistible to Miller. The more they date the more they get closer which means Families need to meet but Greek family and American family are totally different from each other. Thus, Toula and Miller have a really difficult job in terms of cultures conflict. Taula was going to introduce Miller to her family but one relative sees them together in the car while they are kissing. Then all family hear it and come home. Taula's father gets mad that Miller is not a Greek man and does not accept him as a groom. After that day, Family starts to look for different grooms but Taula still loves Miller so much and Miller introduces her to his family. She looks so nervous because Miller's parents are not talkative and lively like her parents. Also, they cannot even pronounce Taula's surname because it is so long and they are not accustomed to hearing it in their daily life but at least they respect her and accept her as a bride. Then Taula's family is persuaded because they see that her little daughter really loves Miller and wants to marry only with him. Miller, Taula, and parents come together and celebrate Easter. In this part of the film, I realized that Miller feels so happy with this strange and noisy family because he has not a family like that. After celebrity, in a short span of time they marry and Father Gus buy them a house as a wedding gift. In my opinion, 'house' is a symbol and it represents that Greek family really adopt and accept him to their big family. The movie ends like this now I want to write about culture concept in this movie. As far as I observe that Greek's daily life and expectations are the same as ours. For example, someone says 'I prepared moussaka tonight for you'. I really know that this is actually our food. This is probably because of so many interactions of two different cultures. The more Greek and Turkish cultures conflict and interact, the more our cultures get similar to each other as we observe here, on the other hand, American's culture is very different from Greek culture. The American family is a little bit calm and they don't live in big families as Greek and Turkish families. Apart from this, the structure of the family is also the same with Greek people. For example, Greek family is also crowded and depended on each other like us. They live together in the same house. Even the altitude of the mother is same. For example, Turkish mother acts as if the guest was starving even though S/he is not. This is because both cultures are welcoming to guests. It was like that in the movie. Until this movie, I have never known that Turkish and Greek cultures are close like this. Another similarity is getting married off. In Turkey, if you are mature people who have a great job, you need to marry with someone like in the movie. Until this movie, I guess that we are the only ones supporting marriage after a particular age, but I think it is good to hear other voices. Other similarities between two cultures are music. I feel like I am watching a Turkish series. Especially in the wedding ceremony, the tone is very Islamic and they say 'amin' instead of 'amen'. Also Greeks like eating meat like us that's why they feel shocked when they hear that Miller is vegetarian. I learned that Greek and Turkish cultures are so similar with the help of this movie. To sum up, people from different background and cultures can get on well with each other and people should not be prejudged. As far as I observe If you are racist and nationalist to people maybe you cannot realize and see the good part of them. As Gus says Toula can be 'Portokalos' which means orange and Miller can be 'apple' but they are all fruits.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
413,deslaughton,Not a Greek 'drama'. Like a nicely shot wedding video. No twists or tension.,6,31 August 2018,"When I watched this fluffy, pleasant looking film, I was waiting for the plot twist that creates the tension that pulls me in, which is present in pretty much every other film I've seen and enjoyed. Would she find it hard to woo her dream husband? Nope, it all went swimmingly. Would there be a hitch in the planning of the wedding? Again, no. Would her traditional Greek family oppose her union with a non-Greek? Ochi. Not at all. Her dad was a grumpy stick-in-the-mud in regard to pretty much everything, but not an obstructive bigot. This lack of any real 'risk' in the straightforward procession to the central characters' wedding really threw me - I can't recall any other movie where the plot is so devoid of potential pitfalls - in that respect it renders itself unique. I honestly didn't think it possible that a likeable story could exist where the hero/heroine doesn't really have to overcome anything.

The story was pretty good. I really liked the big family. I think having a crazy family is something that everyone can relate to. I know my family is certainly nuts. I like big families that have a strong heritage they are always a lot of fun. I thought the story was believable and the acting was good. I thought they were really over the top with all the Greek flag stuff and the statues, but then again I was at a Greek festival and the people seemed very proud! I cracked up at the baptism scene adults getting baptized always seems a bit strange to me.

421,bibi-ilhabela,my criticism,8,24 March 2020,"The film revolves around Romance, but it is not based solely on that, which drew a lot of attention and importance. We saw that the film touches on several themes besides this, such as traditional Greek education, not eating meat, different traditions and cultures from different points of view, which in this case I thought was fantastic because it really involves us and we learn in the film.
It is a union of romance but also with funny parts, it is a type of film that has simplicity, purpose, authenticity and cultural combinations.
I'm not a big fan of romance movies, but without a doubt this one ended up captivating me because it doesn't just revolve in the couple's love, like a fairy tale, and in reality tackling different themes that ends up uniting them even more, it's a film good.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
422,guipb,A Greek Wedding,6,24 March 2020,"Good romantic-comedy about a Greek-American girl which has to fight against her family's strict traditions in order to marry a non-Greek boy. I think that, for the Greek people, this movie must be full of topics and stereotypes, and have other meanings, but for the ones who don't know about Greek ways of life is pretty funny. There are all kind of weird characters (the grandma!!!), and the starring actress makes an outstanding job showing us the metamorphosis of that timid girl to a liberated one. Nice dialogs, nice rhythm... overall is a good movie.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

And I wasn't alone.  Laughter resonated from the entire audience, and I wasn't the only person smiling as I exited.And for the most part, the movie was clean.

It consists of nothing that has not gone before, merely with a Greek slant instead of another quaint sub-American stereotyped minority.

Turks and Greeks are maybe the closest nations for behavior and tradition although languages and religions are different.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of those very rare movies.Born of a Greek father and non-Greek mother, I can honestly attest to many of the characters and scenes that are portrayed in the movie.  It brings back distant memories that suddenly came back sharply into focus: - the feeling of being out-of-step with my non-Greek peers at school who could not spell or pronounce my last name - the acerbically funny and crazy comments from aunts, uncles and cousins - the madness of family get-togethers (which I can now look back upon with a humorous eye)A very special thanks goes to Nia Vardalos for writing this movie in the first place, the director for recruiting such great acting talent such as Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan, and for sharing her and many others' life experiences using a wonderfully funny and illustrative movie.Efcharisto!Le Grecque",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Coming from a half Iranian family, I felt I was looking at my own family half the time.  It was almost scary.  The humor was great.  (I often found I was the only one laughing at times, though.)  I didn't find it offensive (besides a Greek wrote it).  I just really think the whole idea is very enduring.

444,cdro,Best ethnic comedy in years,10,11 August 2002,"Although superficially about a Greek-American family caught between their Old World loyalties and love of their daughter, it is really about the ambivalent relationship that all mixed heritage, Western civilization residents have with their family history.  I reminded me of ""My Favorite Year"" (which also featured Lainie Kazan) in which a 1950's Jewish-American TV writer tries to reconcile the embarrassment he felt for his ethnic family when introduced to an iconic, washed-up movie star. Neither movie was really about ethnicity; both are about the humor inherent in the balance between the pride and customs of family and the desire for self-determination and acceptance. I recognized the `sheep brains/ eyeball' eating story and `crazy, non-English speaking Grandmother' from other non-Greek origins. The producers did not cast a Hollywood super-model as the female love interest, played by Nia Vardalos (an opportunity missed by casting the surgically enhanced, narcissistic Cher in ""Moonstruck"") and she is perfect as the less-then-beautiful 30 yr. old.  She looks like she ought to look.  John Corbett appears as the compliant and good-natured WASP who happily submits to the mild indignities that the family, in their robustness, sees fit to inflict upon him.  Do not look for tension, deep meaning, car chases, and secret conspiracies or drug addiction.  Those who grew up on such pap may be bored, as will be those who have no experience with cultural heritage sharing.  I personally love the father's insistence on pseudoeducational games (`tell me the word and I'll tell you the Greek root') and the mother's low-key control of the father's decision-making.

Also, when the mood of each scene was set, it followed through.

And also there is a huge difference between the propaganda and the cinema! Another point is that all Greek people do not think about the Turks like the movie presents. I just wanted to like the movie before I watched. Before the movie I had no any antipathy about the life style of people who are extremely Greek, but after the movie I decided that this is just an ethnocentric work.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a movie for everyone to see if you like a good laugh. I gave My Big Fat Greek Wedding a ten because it is a funny movie.

As far as comedy goes, it surprised me: almost all other comedy movies recently produced have a couple of good laughs, yet My Big Fat Greek Wedding left me with the impression there were almost no 15 seconds breaks without laughing out loud the entire length of the movie. Although very well made in the comedy part, it was very captivating. There were also no 'fillers' that threw you out of the picture. The message of the movie is exceptional too, I mean there were a couple of scenes in the movie which touched home.. myself being originally from Romania, big family... Overall, it's a great movie and if you have the occasion to watch it, don't miss it. I'm a big movie fan and I don't quite remember another movie quite like it.

I really hope movies like this will help people see that you don't need ""big"" names and a big budget to make an entertaining movie (but hey, having Tom Hanks behind it can't hurt).My biggest problem with the movie, however, was the question of WHY it set in Chicago. It made no difference to the plot, and it was so obviously Toronto and with so many local actors that it seemed pointless to say otherwise.I'm from Toronto, so I'm biased, but would you (Mr./Ms. Middle America USA) somehow not enjoy the movie if it was set in Toronto rather than Chicago? Would you tell your friends ""It was a really funny movie, I'd suggest you go see it, but no, it was set in a foreign land so don't go""? Did people everywhere outside of Toronto get upset when Mini Me was wearing the Toronto Maple Leafs shirt in Goldmember?

I really had no greater expectation than for a lighthearted romantic comedy about a big ""ethnic"" family.Despite the incredibly trite and cliched Cinderella transformation of a dowdy, frumpy woman with ill-fitting glasses into a confident, radiant woman with contact lenses, I did, in fact, enjoy the first 45 minutes or so. True, the jokes were unoriginal and there wasn't much of a story, but I was looking for fun and light, and it delivered.However, the rehash (over and over and over) of the same half-dozen ""eccentric ethnic family"" (and corresponding ""lifeless snobby WASPs"") jokes, the lack of an engaging storyline and the two-dimensional characters got tiring after a while.The movie makes no effort to explain the attraction and romance between the couple -- they're just thrown together as an excuse for the wedding, which is necessary to work in the aforementioned jokes.  What little story and character development there was just the minimum necessary to set up the jokes.

Seeing the movie will make you laugh as you have never done before. You can choose to laugh at the Greek people or to laugh with them, the choice is yours.The movie is a wonderful story about history, family, tradition, love and how it all can be overcome. It gives a critic of a traditionally conservative society and on the contrary proves a point that not all that is old is bad. The thing you'll learn is that one must cherish the family values. But sometimes, it's just not that easy. Change yourself but never lose your identity. Give yourself a chance to have a big fat greek wedding, you won't be sorry.

My mother had seen it twice before I had seen it, and that says something about a Greek woman who the last time went to a movie theater was to see the re-release of Bambi at the dollar theater when I was five in 1987. When I saw it, I was amazed at how the movie captured the Greek-American family. When I was the Koumbaro (best man) at my cousin's wedding she was marrying a non-Greek. I noticed the movie portrayed the wedding exactly and also what the poor groom went through. All in all, the movie was great! There were so many parts where I couldn't stop laughing because of its nostalgic humor, and other parts where I got choked up simply because of its nostalgia. But even if you're not Greek you could relate to the movie's character's and humor. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

Very realistic, yet with a spark of fantasy that lets you fly over too much reality in a movie problems. Goes straight to one good point , sometimes problems are only as big as you see them.

Yes, some moments are a little silly, but if you've ever been around a large close family with lots of relatives that's even remotely similar to the Greek family in this film, you probably already ""get it"" as far as much of this film goes.I'm guessing those who don't like this film probably find it unrealistic or unbelievable because they don't know how close to reality this film hits for some. Knowing things similar to those in the film really happen knock this from a 7 or an 8 up to about a 9.8 or 9.9...This movie is a treat to watch over and again and I always feel better after I see it than before it started.

This movie is also filled with clichés and xenophobic statements. The only reason this pile of dung is rated high is because Greeks who feel proud to be associated with a movie of their own, blindly give it 10 stars. I should've walked out of the cinema but I guess I was feeling masochistic at the time. Don't make the same mistake I did and see this movie.

That's where the fun begins as Michael Constantine her father is not happy her daughter is marrying a ""stranger""(a non-Greek).  Constantine shines as he portrays a very protective, caring, loving father.  The movie was superbly cast. The movie is of light fare, great for the entire family.  Can't help to think that this would have made a great TV series.  Sort of a Greek ""All in the family"". I understand a sequel is already planned titled ""My Big Fat Greek Baby"".

There is no romance in it and there are way better rom-coms with this high ratings (6+). For instance: how to lose a guy in ten days, while you were sleeping, two weeks notice, you've got mail, what women want, etc. All have somewhat of the same rating but are way better.Furthermore there is no story in it. It more looks like a random film off a few days in the life of Toula, who to me is a very bad actor. I am not exaggerating. After one and an have hour of watching, nothing happened. There is no plot.There was something wrong with the sound in this movie as well, it almost appeared as if the characters did not have mics on them or so.

If you want to see a completely accurate portrayal of a Greek family, don't see this movie. Everybody has things about their family which they would like to keep secret, this movie takes many of those, runs with them and makes them humorous (i.e., a parent's views on who their child shall marry).

The fact that many of the characters themselves were actually Greek, introduces us to a culture that is hardly ever heard of.  After seeing the movie, Italians, Filipinos, and Latinos alike can say : The Greeks almost eat as much as we do.  It diminishes ethnic lines and lets us see how truly similar we are.

Excellent comic timing, and a lively pace accentuate the genuine but over-the-top characters. There wasn't one actor who doesn't give an amazing performance. Particularly entertaining are Louis Mandylor as the macho artist brother Nick, Andrea Martin as the nagging, crazy Aunt Voula, and Gia Carides as the slutty cousin Nikki. Also, Nia Vardalos both wrote the screenplay and stars in the film. Though the plot itself was a cheesy romance, you completely forgive that because of how wonderful the rest is.

493,JohnS43,Funny and entertaining,8,20 April 2002,"I saw the one-woman show that was the inspiration for this movie several years ago(at the Globe Theatre in West Hollywood, CA).  The movie basically follows the same storyline, but it's obviously greatly ""opened up"" with the addition of additional characters and actors playing them.I'm assuming the movie is semi-autobiographical, because in real life Nia Vardalos (the author and star) is married to a man named Ian, just like in the movie; however, her real-life Ian is Ian Gomez, the guy who plays the movie Ian's (Ian Miller--played by John Corbett) best friend, Mike.  (He's also on ""The Drew Carey Show,"" ""Felicity"" and the late ""Norm."")  I seem to recall that the Ian in the one-woman show/play was British, but I could be mistaken.  In any event, it seems unlikely that Ian GOMEZ's family could be as whitebread/WASPy as Ian Miller's in the movie!  In fact, Ian Gomez's IMDB listing says he's of ""Puerto Rican, Jewish and GREEK extraction,"" so I'd assume the real-life romance wasn't quite the culture shock that the movie presents. Anyway, that said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  It's full of ethnic stereotypes, and I don't mean just stereotyping of Greeks and Greek-Americans.  As I said above, Ian Miller's family is about as uptighty-whitey as they come!  So, if you enjoy broad ethnic comedy (think ""The Nanny""), you will enjoy this.My only other comment is that this movie seems to be a bit anachronistic. I'm not sure when it was set, but it seems to be fairly modern-day.  I have a hard time believing that women today (or even in the past 20 years) would feel as repressed/oppressed as the Toula did in this one.

499,toadsprket,Would have been better as a sitcom,5,15 February 2003,"I hear this movie is being made into a sitcom, which is not surprising, because it has about 30 minutes worth of storyline, reuses the same jokes over and over again, and is a blatant rip off of such comedies as Everybody Loves Raymond (on tv) and Moonstruck (in the movies).  It wasn't terrible and it wasn't too offensive if you don't mind completely stereotypical characters (and by this I mean Greeks and Non-Greeks alike) and a ""haven't I seen this before?"" plot.  Really, the only innovation here is that Greeks are substituted for Italians, Jews, or any other group that is defined by overbearing ""eat more"" parents.  It was fun to see the Greek side of things and there were a few funny jokes, but for the most part, it reeks of sitcom. It has been asked, ""If it is so ordinary, why do people like it so much?"" Well, people liked Moonstruck too.  And, they like Everybody Loves Raymond and every other similar plotline.  That is because everyone of every ethnicity has a crazy family which drives them crazy at times.  So, on some level, everyone can relate.  The only problem lies in the fact that the eccentricities and ""originality"" of the film are not that eccentric or original.  Like I said before, not awful, but not great or even that funny either.  I recommend if you like romantic comedies or ""family"" pictures and don't mind seeing all the same conventions and jokes again.  If you liked Maid in Manhattan, How to Lose a Guy in 10 days, or anything of the like, then RUN, don't walk to rent this.  If you LOVED Moonstruck or any movie with an eccentric family, again, Run. Otherwise, wait for cable. To the best screenplay Oscar, I laugh and say, if only Tom Hanks hadn't ever heard of the movie, it would already be on cable.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
500,happy_accidents,~ tries too hard ~unintelligent~ forced humor ~ not at all funny,1,26 November 2007,"I'm so glad to see that others disliked this movie as I did and for the same reasons. 'It's only funny (or sad) if it makes sense' as said by another reviewer. So true ! This is such unintelligent humor that so forced and overdone and unoriginal. And the characters are so cold-hearted and miserable but not in a funny way-in a creepy way. And since we're talking about a movie filled with stereotypes, I can say that I'd always thought the Mediterranean people for the most part were a warm and inviting people. Not here. The way they treated Ian was so uncomfortable and senseless and just weird. It was yet another film that made white men look weak and like big defenseless dorks. I'm married to a white dude who if my family would have treated him that way, he'd say a few choice words and never return and I wouldn't blame him; in fact I'd follow him out the door. And I realize that the whole point of the movie is that her family is so involved in her life because they care and blah blah but enough already! It got old and sickening after a while. OK we get it, you're close-knit and you fight and bicker because you love each other and that's your Greek culture etc. etc I wanted to puke already. Even Toula wasn't the friendly, sweet character I had in mind. Instead, she really lacked personality and warmth. You expect to fall in love with and root for the main character especially in a comedy like this, but I was halfway through the movie and didn't care whether she was happy in the end or what happened to her. And no one was sitting on the groom's side of the church: why? I guess it's comical that white people tend to have smaller and/or unsupportive families and less friends than Greeks ?? Not to me. And the way she looked before her makeover? C'mon! Who looks like that? It's not like she was supposed to have a mental disorder or something. Like I said, it's forced and unoriginal. It tries way too hard. I kept wondering when is it going to get good? When is it going to get funny? I can't believe that it's a hit.... Actually I can believe it. Movies that appeal to the masses usually suck. Good humor needs to be smart, clever and witty. This film and its storyline are none of the above.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
501,srrquinn,A must-see comedy,10,18 May 2002,"For once, a comedy that is actually funny! I can't say enough good things about this film. The screenplay is very well written, the casting is great, the acting is terrific, etc. More laughs here than just about any movie out there (and without sinking to vulgarity and crudeness). Honestly, I've never heard the whole audience laugh as much as when I saw this movie. In my opinion, it's one of the best comedies ever made. My compliments to Nia Vardalos, plus the rest of the cast and crew, on a job well done!! I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I thought it was a sweet and enjoyable flick about a girl in a huge family trying to be herself.  I can relate a lot with the main character, my family is the exact same way as her (but German).The Aunt cracked me up, her and the grandmother.  I do not want to give too much away and ruin the film for anyone, just go see this movie.

505,MaryKay97,I had a problem with the movie's stereotypes,5,16 June 2002,"The movie had a lot of funny elements. I could certainly identify with many because I come from a Greek Family. My maiden name is Santrizos, so I had a tough time in school with others' pronunciation of it. Also, both my grandfathers were restaurant owners. My parents were both born in the United States but were pressured to marry Greeks (in the 1950s). They broke away from the Greek church when I was only a toddler and moved away from a tight Greek community in Minnesota to (new age) California. I have a problem with the offensive stereotypes in this movie.  I was at my cousin's wedding in New York and it was a classy event all the way. The reception was held at Tavern on the Green. There was no ""spitting"" either!  The Greeks portrayed in this movie were obnoxious and uncouth (except for the star). I also married a non-Greek. I thought Moonstruck was better and think that Olympia Dukakis should have been in this movie.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
506,drmanosz,Half-funny B-rated Greek cliches from past times.,4,18 June 2002,"Yes, some of it was funny and cute-ly done, and much of it reflected the family enmeshment and love, and the funny as much as asphyxiating ethnic, generational, and gender lines that characterize traditional Greek (among other traditional) families... But for a one in a decade Greek-american movie, how can you not complain about its unelegant (both in its writing and direction) portrayal of peasant stereotypes oozing from past generations... A dumb-sounding (could he talk any slower?), manipulated ethnocentric (always looking for the Greek etymology to glorify our language) father, the hysterical Turk-hating grandmother, the epidemic of more hysterical, loud, or ""fat"" women, the immature adult males (""dirty"" pranksters or approval seeking sons), and (how nauseatingly sweet!) the love-melting and home/family store-bound till marriage (and not going too far after... although admittedly through a hysterically funny gift!) 30+ year old virgin... might had been a precious (and admittedly not yet obsolete in the immigrant ghettos outside Greece) mosaic of Greek anthropologic caricatures, leading to thought provoking discussions, but... because of its low budget/writing/directing quality, remains just a (half-)funny B-rated cellulitic version (better suited for post-midnight TV) of a family- and fun-loving immigrant ethnic's close-knit but insecurely ethnocentric and taboo-filled past. I can only hope that the movie's apparent commercial success among the Greek-identified masses inspires and leads to productions at a higher level of ethnic-based entertainment. Recommended only for those immune to big/fat cliches (and social scientists).",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
507,hhotamanda,great movie,10,19 June 2002,"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. While some of the scenes come off as required material for an ethnic comedy, it still has a freshness to it, and though some of the characters seem stock, they are none the less endearing. The writing is incredible and acutally plausible, which is generally hard to come by in a romantic comedy.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I went on a beautiful Saturday afternoon - trying to kill two hours - before I went to a wedding.  The theater, with the exception of the first few rows, was full.  We laughed at both the visual jokes and the verbal humor.  It is not a movie where one has to think nor is it full of mindless gags!  If the title doesn't make one smile, then one shouldn't go!  ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is an excellent, funny movie for those who are of an ethnic group or those who know someone who is!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
509,teraelea,Excellent ethnic comedy,10,1 July 2002,"Saw this movie twice and laughed just as much the second time. You don't have to be Greek to enjoy it.

510,djwalton57,"More ""big fat"" laughs than expected.",10,7 July 2002,"Nia Vardalos is a remarkable talent. As both writer and star of ""Wedding"" she has captured ethnicity in a way that allows all of us, Greek or not, to laugh at ourselves and our well meaning loved ones. Although a neat star vehicle for Vardalos the actor, Vardalos the writer allows an ensemble cast to shine. Noteworthy performances by Lainie Kazan as Vardalos' mother, Andrea Martin as her aunt and the durable Michael Constantine as her father. As the fiance who knows not what he's getting into, John Corbett provides just enough white bread to seem out of place in the spicy Greek family and yet plausibly in love with the transformed heroine.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I am sure that some views who are not as ethnic as others might think it is a movie about a Greek girl who's parents want her to marry a Greek boy.Well they would be wrong.  It is a movie about every girl's family, and for that matter every boy's family.  It so perfectly imitates life that it becomes funny.The entire cast does a fantastic job, and the end is perfect.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

It was produced with no violence, no sexual content, and no vulgar language. And as evidenced by its longevity, the movie going public doesn't need the above to enjoy a movie. A big bravo to the writer and the excellent cast. I saw it at a 5 oclock showing last week and the theater was almost filled. There was so much laughter I'm sure that I missed some of the funny lines. I will be seeing it again. Hey Hollywood, please take a good long look at this type of movie. You don't need $100,000,000 budgets, and you don't need super stars to be successful.A big thank-you to Tom Hanks,and his wife, Rita Wilson for producing this wonderful film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
514,stokes70,"Funny, corny and endearing",9,28 July 2002,"Having recently experienced our South Florida son marrying a Texas belle in Dallas, I had to relate to this movie.  Its not just about Greeks marrying WASPS, its about Everywedding, when two weird families (""all families are weird"" is a line from the movie) get joined through their offspring, with patient good humor, high anxiety and enough to stress to make you laugh out loud several times during the wedding weekend (not to mention this movie). The bride avoids being ""trapped by her past"" but takes her ""past into her future"" (as her brother states, profoundly quoting Dear Abby).  What a really corny thought!  What a corny movie! So why am I tearing up here? Why am I laughing?  See this movie.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
515,suuzin,"A big, fat waste of time!",1,9 August 2002,"I can hardly believe the comments I've read on this site about this movie having ""wholesome ethnic humor"" and being ""lovely,"" and ""sensitive."" This is the most insulting movie I've seen in a long time, and poorly (obviously cheaply) done at that. First off, I am NOT Greek, I DO have an Italian maternal family that reminded me of some of the family members, and I AM a woman in her thirties. The relationship between the father and the daughter -- I don't care what ethnicity they are -- was nothing short of dysfunctional and psychologically damaging. The daughter was a big, fat Greek wimp for not telling Paps to take a hike if he didn't like it that she wasn't married or didn't wear make-up to look like society's version of ""beautiful"" (i.e. ""Barbie"").. and that women shouldn't be educated. The fact that we were supposed to laugh at this guy because ""Oh, he's just Greek... isn't that cute"" made it worse.What's wrong with you people, particularly the women? Not only was it totally unbelievable and contrived that the daughter should suddenly, out of the blue at the age of 30 want to start wearing make-up, do her hair differently and pursue a career, but it's highly insulting to women everywhere that the implication was that this should suddenly change her life to the extent that Mr. Right comes walking right in -- and she gets to sit with the pretty, popular blond girls at lunch. PLEASE!!! (And ironically, the most soulless doll of them all for me in this movie was ""Ken,"" i.e., Mr. Right. Boring!!)The most I can say was that there were a few clean funnies poked at the Greek family culture, but I definitely couldn't get past the uninteresting (at best), damaging (at worst), contrived plot and soulless characters.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

I, someday, want to have a big, fat, Greek wedding, and oh, I know its going to be hectic. I just want to say to those who haven't seen it, see it, guarantee you'll like it.

525,rainbeaux,"I'm Lebanese, and boy, can I ever relate...",10,31 August 2002,"A lot of people here have said one thing they had against the film initially was the inclusion of Joey Fatone of 'N Sync.  I'm just the opposite -- an 'N Sync fan who may never have heard of this movie if not for his part in it. So I went, I saw, and except for the brief moments he was actually onscreen (pop-haters, never fear -- he probably doesn't have five scenes in the whole film) I forgot that Fatone was even there. I'm a teenage girl and a big fan of romantic comedies, but it's nearly impossible in the new millennium to find one without vulgarities peppered all over it.  I can't remember the last time I saw a PG-rated movie that didn't come from the Disney animated studios.  I haven't seen such an all out GOOD MOVIE since Fellowship of the Ring, and not such a perfect piece of laugh-out-loud escapism since The Emperor's New Groove.  This definitely isn't a kiddie movie, but it manages to be funny without being crude, quite an accomplishment these days. As for the ethno-centricity of the plot -- yes, maybe so.  I can see where this movie would be much more amusing to someone who's lived with a family like that.  The party I went with was myself (a fourth-generation Lebanese girl) and three WASPs, and while we all loved the movie, I was giggling for a much longer time afterwards than my friends, if only because I read so many of my friends and family into the film. I almost didn't put my review down, seeing as almost everyone else loved it as much as I did, but I don't think enough good things can be said for this film.  If there isn't a Best Comedy nomination in this film's future, there is truly no justice in the world.  It might have been better if Fatone had had more scenes, but aside from that one pop fan's gripe, it's easily the best comedy of the year.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

527,JulieAnne209,Surprisingly charming and funny,9,2 September 2002,"I was a bit hesitant about this movie after reading a negative review that used words such as ""shrill"" and ""cliche"" to describe ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and its characters. I myself found the movie to be sweet, surprising, and at times hilarious. What the reviewer calls ""shrill,"" I call colorful and interesting. The movie shows that all families are crazy on some level -- some are just more loud and obvious about it. People have been calling this an ""ethnic"" comedy, but fundamentally it's just about all the idiosyncrasies that make a family and about the kind of love that can emerge from embracing those differences. If you're not opposed to a movie making you feel good, you might want to check out ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""

I didn't want it to end. I am glad to see that this film is growing in popularity at the box- office (15th week in top ten) and am hoping Hollywood takes a cue and realizes that there really is a market for this kind of movie.

(I used a pass -- otherwise it wouldn't have interested me, although I admit that I love a good chick flick.)  I found it mildly amusing, but mostly predictable in regard to the ethnic stereotypes and the way the story played out. Sometimes it was even the WRONG ethnicity! The major flaw in the story, to me, was the complete lack of chemistry between the  two romantic leads. FYI my 3-star review does not even take into account the fact that a Canadian city body-doubles for Chicago, not to mention the lack of geographical logic inherent with a guy stopping by Greek Town on his way to teach at Lincoln Park High School. I'm still traumatized, however, by the crowd in the theater where I saw this film.  I was very disturbed by how hard they laughed.  I mean, knee-slapping, feet-stomping, ha-ha-ha with tears in their eyes!  Even in the parts where you could recite the line along with the actors because it was so predictable! (Like the bridesmaid dresses.) For some reason, I'm compelled to compare MBFGW with Monsoon Wedding, which I saw a few months previously.  Loved it!  Far superior in capturing similar themes.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

That just seems like so much fun, and anyone who has a big fat Greek family, should truly embrace it for what it is! The wedding looks like so much fun, the dancing the food, the amazing gift her father gives them... and so on.

548,hugopery,A Nice 90 Minutes,8,24 November 2002,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding was based on Nia Vardalos' one woman comedy act. It is no wonder it plays like a stand-up routine. The characters are exaggerated much like a stand-up comedian could do. Of course Nia feels like the only normal one in the family. As if she has somehow dodged the enculturation process like the rest of her family. If you can accept the characters for that and embrace them, then My Big Fat Greek Wedding is an enjoyable film. The format is not new and there is not much substance to the story. However, the characters are loveable, which makes it easier to laugh. I just saw this recently so it was hard to watch it without taking in account all the hype it has received. I don't know if it as worthy as the hype suggests, but it's definitely a fun movie. At little over ninety minutes, it pulls you in but doesn't stay long enough to try your patience. It introduces you to the family instead of making you feel as though you live with them.*** out of ****",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
549,Kronenbourg1664,Insane!,9,6 January 2003,"How is it that I can relate to this movie so well???  Being from England and living in America makes me realize how lucky I am -- if this movie is a true portrayal of how Greek families are -- then it just so seems that my family is the same!My Big Fat Greek Wedding...gosh!  I didn't know what to expect -- heard so many good things about the movie, but at the start it would appear that the movie wouldn't live up to my expectations after hearing friends rave about it!  But a love story unfolds and the true meaning of family shines in this movie, although sometimes the family thing appears a bit O.T.T, but that added to the comical side of the movie!My partner said it was a bit of a ""chick"" flick -- I do agree, but I loved the movie, although the beginning was a bit deceiving!  It was all in all a GREAT MOVIE!!!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

552,monkey2,This is why I think My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a great movie.,9,3 December 2002,"I believe that My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a good film because it captures the uniqueness of the character but also allows viewers to relate to the main character.  I personally felt like I could relate to the character, despite the fact that we are from completely different cultures.  The charater Toula, was portrayed very realistically but did not steer away from the comic scene.  One very specific scene would be when her brother would tell her fiance how to say some frazes in Greek.  Of course, since her fiance was not Greek, he bought it and said the frazes, assuming they were innocent lines.  To his amazement, he was saying other frazes.  My point with this is, you could see people doing this in many different cultures, and I felt this added to the movie a sence of connection with the viewers. Even when there was a difference in culture, you could still relate to the character.  She still wanted to be independent and learn to accept herself. We all need to learn that regardless of our background.  My final insignificant note would be that I loved the portrayal of the Greek Orthodox Church.  I happened to be Orthodox too and I felt that the movie did a very good job making a realistic portrayal of Orthodoxy without pushing it in people's faces.  One thing that movies often do when they put religian in it is they tend to either unrealistically prtray religian or have a bias of the religian (making the religian standing in people's faces or too ""behind the scenes, leaving viewers with a false sence of the religian).  I don't feel that this movie did this.  So for what the movie was worth, it was great! I want to see it again!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
553,uconnfan101,Great fun!,9,2 January 2003,"When my wife mentioned this movie, I really didn't want to see it. However, the opening credits showed the ""Playtone"" label from ""That Thing You Do"", another Hanks vehicle, and I suddenly had hope.  As it turns out, this is one of the most fun films I have ever seen.  And sometimes it's fine for movies to just be fun.I've read some pretty negative remarks here about this film, but frankly, the laughter in the theater was so loud, I sometimes had trouble hearing the next line.  And everyone I know that has seen it enjoyed it as well, so the film makers must have done something right.If you enjoy pure ""feel good"" movies, this one is a must see.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
554,shootamonga,They're everyones family,10,8 March 2003,"There's a reason why this movie is the highest grossing romantic comedy- its funny!  The best part (and there are many) about this film is that Nia's family is everyone's family.  We all feel like we have a crazy family and feel for her when she's embarrassed, making a powerful connection with her. Anywho the movie is witty, timeless, and the funniest film I've ever seen. EVER!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
555,Jerph,Utter poop,4,19 August 2003,"This movie was bought for me, and I was actually excited to watch it because of it's high rating here on IMDb.  It is thus one of the biggest disappointments of my entire life.  The acting is actually good for what the actors had to work with, but that's not saying much.  The script is *bad*. If you want some examples of what I'm talking about (SPOILERS!!): In the school scene where Toula asks Ian if they can elope, you can almost feel the tension of `I have no idea how to say this line.'  They can't put any real emotion behind these very tender and loving words because they're such empty, flat characters that emotion can't be imagined. In the scene where Ian tells his friend he won't be Ian's best man, it's as though Vardalos couldn't think of anything for either of them to say, so she just left the bits and pieces of various conversations in the script and called it a scene. After the dinner with Ian's parents, where they showed some kind of character (albeit atrociously stereotyped character) they say almost NOTHING AT ALL!   Again, through the wedding planning, the party with Toula's family, all of it, it's as though Vardalos just couldn't find something for them to say, so she left it out!  Now, one could see it as realistic; that often people are really like that when they're uncomfortable.  But if it's not interesting or funny, what's the point of realism?? I could go on.  I'll stop.  I don't mean to bash Ms. Vardalos' skill.  (If you're reading this, I'm sorry :)  But the truth is that this movie just isn't good.  It fails as a romance because of poor (i.e. missing) character development, and it fails as a comedy because of poor (i.e. missing) dialogue. Rating: 4/10",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
556,roblopes,The funniest movie I've ever seen.,10,15 February 2003,"The funniest movie I've ever seen.The fact that people left the cinema recalling scenes of the movie and saying ""opa"" says a lot...Even though the movie, as any comedy uses to do, makes intensive use of stereotypes, it's a remarkable work. It's truly fun, without recurring to obscenity nor vulgarity as the typical ""modern"" comedies. Also, the actors worked very well.I will certainly watch it again soon.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

559,ellisbooks,Do not watch this film,1,12 May 2003,"I have never before been moved to write a review of a film, but the hype given to this film on release must be resisted. It has virtually no redeeming features. The script is weak, the acting is weak, the plot is predictable. People who should know better have described this film as 'hilarious'. Well, I suppose if hilarity can be engendered by heavyhanded racial stereotyping and a running joke about Windex, then perhaps it is indeed hilarious. I feel conned.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
560,reproach,Ethnicaly Cleansed,1,11 August 2003,"I was disappointed with this film, it had a lot of hype and was self proclaimed comedy of the year. Well, maybe the people of North America with identity crisis' found it hilarious, but as somebody who doesnt think he is ""Greek-Scotch"" or ""Dutch-Irish"" i just wasn't amused by the constant ""I'm very Greek, me"" gags. Thus, the very esscence of the comedy was lost making this pretty dull. Past the very thin concept, there was no substance. There is a word for people who are born/raised in America, we call them Americans, its nothing to be ashamed of man!",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

But thankfully, there also come a few like My Big Fat Greek Wedding which leave you with a feeling of giddy happiness. I absolutely loved the film. The story was nice, funny and romantic.

564,livikaa,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,7,10 December 2011,"""My big fat Greek wedding"" is a simple movie woven with comedy and romantic moments. all the story is based on difficulties that can occur between a Greek woman dating a Xeno. i would recommend this film as a perfect one to be watched with your family on a Saturday night with popcorn and soda. while watching you will see some beautiful traditions. you will also notice how Greeks keep and follow their own rules. i think the climax of this movie is the moment when Toula's father forbade her from dating a non-Greek. although there where a lot of interesting and hilarious moments in the movie, my favourite part was before the celebration, when Toula's grandmother came and gave her a wedding present: a box with some old photos and a flower crown. i suppose, it was a family heritage that was very precious. I can say with no doubts, that Portokalas is one of the funniest family, especially Toula's father. i like the way how he treats everything with Windex. moreover, i like how easily he can come up with a Greek root for every word. i admire Ian's strength, because every time Toula wanted to skulk off he was the one to support and to help her pass through hard time. i think it was hard for him to find a way to get used to his girlfriend's big family. this romantic story finishes with a happy ending, when Toula and Ian's child goes to a Greek school. this movie taught me that even if we are different and we belong different backgrounds, in the end we are all the same.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
565,punkert,I usually make it through an entire movie,1,2 August 2003,"This is the first time that I have ever posted a review of a film but I must say that this movie was terrible. I work at a video store so I basically see everything that comes out. I figured that this movie would be watchable because everyone praised it so much. I popped it into my dvd player and watched the first hour, I was completely frustrated out of my mind. The characters were so dull and boring, it was not funny and I was very tired of hearing the word ""Greek"".  I decided to go ahead and kind of slip the fast forward button on through most of the rest of the movie. I would write more about how much I hate this movie but I am nearly late for the lynching at the town hall of all the poor folk who cannot bear to live with themselves after seeing this more than poor film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
566,sven-van-de-velde-139-666246,This was soooooo funny!!!,10,19 September 2016,"This is not a real review, but watching this movie made me laugh sooo much. Reason: I got also married with a lady who is Greek Catholic. And a lot of the rituals and the cultural complexities in the movie were so much comparable with what I've been through. Mainly because the man gets married with a Greek woman. Anyway, we are married now for 16 years, and have 4 kids. There were scenes in this movie that made me find air again. For sure the author of the script or book must have been through the same situation, and wrote it down. Great movie to watch, timeless story, and so recognizable! Beautiful how different cultures create a tighter family and make people love each other more! Sven and Teodora-Flora",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
567,gringostarz,A charming although formulaic romantic comedy,7,8 March 2004,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding makes up for what it lacks in plot with a cast of amusing, lovable characters.    Like any large extended family the Portokolos family is a collection of oddball, zany characters.   Toula's father Gus can find the Greek root of any word, and believes windex to be a wondrous cure to any ailment.  Toula's mother says ""the man may be the head of the household, but the woman is the neck, she can turn the head whichever way she wants"".    And throughout the movie we see matriarchal power in action as she and Aunt Voula subtly manipulate Gus, the father.    Toula's Cousin Nikki with her provocative fashion sense and brother Nick with his quiet passion for art, fill out the Portokolos personality tree.In contrast the Millers are a subdued, small family.   Ian has only two cousins.  When Toula invites the Millers over for a quiet dinner to meet her parents they are in for quite a shock.   The dynamics between the overwhelmingly extroverted Portokolos family and the reserved parents of the groom provide some amusing moments.My Big Fat Greek Wedding had potential to be an exceptional film. It was hindered by a far too contrived romance and a particularly unconvincing performance by John Corbett as Ian Miller.   His character was so lacking in personality, so bland, especially in contrast to the Portokolos family members.  Plus the robotic delivery of his declarations of love were unbelievable.    His character seemed an afterthought.    Had Ian Miller been better acted, and developed as well as all of the supporting characters, the film would have been great.  However, it is still an above average romantic comedy, providing many laughs and feel good moments.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

569,JXsha,My Big Fat Disappointment,5,20 August 2004,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding was the sleeper hit of 2002, ascending the box office in the United States that even I, in the tiny corner of Singapore, sat up and took note of its immense success. I remember making a tiny note to myself to buy the VCD ASAP, but I think I forgot about it in the end.It wasn't till late 2004 that I caught this movie and it's just as good that I didn't purchase the VCD because MBFGW is one huge disappointment. I really don't see how anyone can find anything good or positive to say about this movie. It's not funny, it stretches too long and it has absolutely no climax whatsoever. I kept waiting for a funny point where the movie would take a turn for the better and explode into a hilarious sitcom, but it just didn't happen. That's the problem with the movie. It just didn't happen.Maybe I don't know enough about Greek Culture, or I'm uninformed about references humour to see the alleged intelligent ""parodying"" that happens in the movie, but in my opinion, the movie was a complete waste of time and it was utterly disappointing. a 5 out of a 10, and that's generous.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
570,dhanequand,A most boring film,2,2 January 2005,"Hello I am quite sorry to say but I saw this film on television and it's purely a soap,a most ordinary film to say the least! A film catering to the lower class of our society,(no culture but plenty of money)portraying a sort of family feud dear to the soap trend of yesteryear,tailor made to Mrs or Mr average,very boring,no imagination, stereotyped,the usual cliché';the intention of showing Toronto's ethnic mosaic was probably a honest thought since differences should not be a barrier or a hurdle,therefore ""erasing"" differences for the better and make it a success instead,I only can understand this film that way,but I have to say that the story was very ordinary,lacking flair,the script bearing no originality whatsoever,enjoy the day!Daniel",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
571,walkerp1,"A Big, Fat Waste of your Time",3,4 March 2012,"To be fair, let me state up front that my idea of a romantic comedy is ""The War of the Roses"". The nicest thing I can say about ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is that it was occasionally mildly amusing and almost completely not crass. All of the actors produced adequate to very good performances. On the other hand, it is missing some very important story elements.Take for instance the first time I wished the movie was over. It was only about thirty minutes in. I felt like I was bleeding to death in a warm bath. There was no discernible conflict driving the plot forward, and only the interminable grinding of time managed to drag this movie to its final conclusion.So, if goofy romance for its own sake is your thing or you like movies about happy families just enjoying themselves, then this one will appeal to you. If you're a big traditional wedding fan, it has a lot to offer. However, if you don't fit into any of the aforementioned categories, it's a big, fat waste of your time.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding

She goes against all your convictions and hopes that she marry a good (fill in your cultural group) boy.The way Ian has to embrace Toula's culture is really the successful way to win a family's heart.Having lived in 4 countries with 3 different languages this movie struck such a chord with me that I would rate it one of the best I have seen in ages.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
573,shadaemendez,Sweet Romantic Comedy,7,2 December 2015,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding is narrated by Toula Portokalos. She says that all Greek women are expected to marry a Greek man, to have Greek children and to feed everyone until the day she dies. However at the age of 30, still single and working at the family restaurant she feels that she is the only woman in her family who has failed at being a typical Greek girl. One day while at the restaurant, Toula meets Ian Miller a non Greek school teacher and is mesmerized by him. She then decides to go to college. Although her father Gus does not initially approve of her seeking a career, he eventually allows her to take computer classes at a local community college. While going to college Toula gains more confidence. She changes her frumpy appearance and gives herself a makeover. She starts to work at a travel agency, where she meets Ian again. They start dating and eventually fall in love. When Gus finds out Toula is dating a non Greek he is outraged and forbids them from seeing each other. However they continue to see each other in secret and eventually Ian proposes to Toula. Toula's family is then force to accept Ian. The audience sees a clash of cultures as Ian and his family becomes engulfed in Toula's Greek culture as the wedding date draws closer. The director does a good job of teaching the audience about Greek culture while adding a nice comedic element to the film. The film is a sweet romantic comedy that anyone who has a crazy family will be able to enjoy and relate to this film.",My Big Fat Greek Wedding
