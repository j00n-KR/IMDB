0,SnoopyStyle,weak teen girl fantasy,5,2 August 2014,"It has always been just Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) and her mom Libby (Kelly Preston) in their tiny NY apartment above a restaurant in Chinatown. She always tells her about her father Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) whose British aristocratic family did not approve. The 17 year old runs off to London to find his dad and possibly a missing piece in her life. He's abandoning his seat in the House of Lords to run for office. He's a rising political star and getting married to Glynnis Payne (Anna Chancellor), the daughter of his adviser Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce) and mother to Clarissa Payne (Christina Cole).It's a standard premise and not particularly well done. Amanda Bynes is suitably adorable and sweet. She's at her bumbling bubbly best. Colin Firth is terribly stiff and oddly weak-minded. It's a stock character that keeps him from developing real chemistry. It's a teen girl fantasy with a dud prince charming. There's even the evil 'step-mother' and 'step-sister'. It's a silly movie that doesn't really work.",What a Girl Wants
1,sunwarrior13,Too Predictable As Amanda's Presence Isn't Enough,5,15 July 2015,"We meet Daphne Reynolds - a girl what every girl wants as she was born into a life full of possibilities.But what's surprising is that she still finds herself incomplete as she want to meet her real father with whom her mother shared a whirlwind romance many years ago.But there are many surprises that came along with this goal as she's gone to London and realize that he happens a high profile politician - Lord Henry Dashwood.Upon meeting the daughter he never knew existed,many things happen and the story begins.What A Girl Wants is a movie for teen-agers.A sanitized version of a typical Olsen twins film obviously but it never surpasses the bar of being an average movie as there is nothing surprising and it is just too predictable for adults watching. Too bad that it is too clichéd that Amanda Bynes' charm and performance as Daphne aren't enough because of it.",What a Girl Wants
2,jotix100,All in the family,6,1 April 2004,"Dennie Gordon has directed this comedy with sure hand. The play by William Douglas-Home was a hit in the London stage and it was filmed before as The Reluctant Debutante with Rex Harrison, Kay Kendall, Sandra Dee, John Saxon and Angela Lansbury in the cast. This new take on the same story is fun basically because of the cast that was assembled to play the main characters.Amanda Bynes has the right amount of charm to make her Daphne an endearing teen who is in search for a father she never knew. Colin Firth is a very good as the father. Kelly Preston has very little to do and it's a shame. Eileen Atkins, as the would be grandmother doesn't fare better, as it's the case with Jonathan Pryce.I recently caught up with it on DVD format and all that can be said is that it was mildly amusing as a typical comedy of this genre.",What a Girl Wants
3,Calicodreamin,Teenage Rom-Com delight,7,18 July 2019,"If you expect this to be an amazing movie then you'll be disappointed. If you expect this to be a teenage rom-com, then you'll be delighted. The perfect escape from reality into the world of a teenager trying to connect with her father only to find that being herself is more important. Amanda Bynes is the perfect leading lady for such a movie, delivery on laughs and sincerity, and a tid bit of bad assness.
My only fault is the canoe scene - how did her neck not kill her after that?!",What a Girl Wants
4,anaconda-40658,What a Girl Wants is a Film Experience Superior to This.,3,29 May 2015,"What a Girl Wants (2003): Dir: Dennie Gordon / Cast: Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, Jonathan Pryce, Oliver James: Recycled teen family film about the importance of good adult role models. Amanda Bynes stars as a girl who longs to see her father who has been absent for seventeen years. She works as a caterer at a banquet her mother sings at. She tells of how her father got into British politics and how she was secretly sent away by his officials. What follows is pure formula as Bynes shows up to meet her father. He is bewildered and overwhelmed while his current fiancé and stepdaughter would prefer that she left. The main joke is that her lifestyle clashes with their culture. An improvement for director Dennie Gordon after making the pathetic The Adventures of Joe Dirt but it is not much of one. Bynes is an absolute delight and holds strong despite predictable developments. Colin Firth as her father is given a good back story before being subdued with standard material that concludes with him learning the truth. Flat supporting roles by Kelly Preston as Bynes's mother, and Jonathan Pryce as one of the corrupt officials. Oliver James plays her romantic interest and he has less personality than a plastic Ken doll. What a girls wants is what everyone needs, and in this case it would be to star in a film of much higher potential than this paper thin charade. Score: 3 ½ / 10",What a Girl Wants
5,Wuchakk,American girl helps loosen up the snooty English,5,15 June 2015,"Released in 2003, ""What a Girl Wants"" stars Amanda Bynes as a 17 year-old who travels to London to meet the father she never knew (Colin Firth). He's of royal blood and has great political aspirations, but his long lost daughter's arrival puts a wrench in the situation. Kelly Preston plays her mother while Anna Chancellor & Christina Cole play the mother/daughter vying for her father's attention in London. Oliver James is on hand as her potential boyfriend and Eileen Atkins has a significant role as the girl's grandmother.It's amazing how easily Amanda carries this film when she was only 16 years-old. She's fun and has a cute face, but a body that hasn't really developed yet. Christina Cole is effective as her nemesis and Firth is a quality protagonist. The subtext about how stuffy ""high society"" Brits need to loosen up with their rigid class consciousness is great, but I found myself generally bored by the proceedings, especially by the time the third act rolled around. The movie's solid entertainment, but it didn't do much for me; maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a film like this. That said, if you're a fan of Bynes or looking for a fun teen adventure flick ""What a Girl Wants"" should fill the bill. However, I prefer 2005's ""Love Wrecked;"" it's simply a more entertaining Bynes' movie. The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in the greater London area with the opening act in New York City. GRADE: C+",What a Girl Wants
6,A_Different_Drummer,"May be remembered as her best work - charming, almost impeccable film",9,8 November 2013,"This review written in late 2013 at a time when Ms. Bynes career seems to have derailed and we wish her the best. In her career to date, the two most accomplished works she has left for us are this film, WHAT A GIRL WANTS, and the work she did a few years later, SHES THE MAN. Will deal with the latter first. SHES THE MAN is one of a small sub-sub-sub class of Hollywood products that attempts to build a movie around the notion of a woman disguised as man. There are at least a dozen of these floating around the IMDb. The writing in SHES THE MAN is way above average, and the supporting cast is perfect. But it is Bynes who steals the show there, possibly doing the most impressive male-female switch in film history. And speaking of stealing the show, that is exactly what she does in WHAT A GIRL WANTS. (The title never seemed a good match to the actual film, which builds slowly and successfully to a satisfying conclusion). Playing opposite a stellar cast (Colin Firth? Wow!) Bynes provided the perfect mix of energy, youth and charm to move this movie into a class of its own. She ""owns"" the role and once you have seen the film, it is hard to imagine anyone else doing it.",What a Girl Wants
7,inkblot11,"What a romcom fan wants, absolutely, that is, a funny, touching story and, oh, Colin Firth",8,12 July 2008,"Daphne Reynolds (an enchanting Amanda Bynes) lives in Chinatown with her lovely mother, Libby (Kelly Preston), a smalltime wedding singer. But, although she has never met him, Daphne's father is Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a Britisher who was briefly married to Libby 17 years ago. It is possible, shortly after the happy nuptials, that advisers to the lord privately arranged for Libby to be shunned and sent packing, due to her being a hippie-type American. Lord Dashwood does not know he has a daughter at all but, things can change. Daphne is determined to meet him and, leaving her mother a note, she flies to London on her own. Naturally, the lord is astonished to learn he is a parent but his surprise is nothing compared to that of his stuffy fiancé and her equally snobbish daughter. Soon enough, Henry embraces and welcomes his daughter into his circle, despite the fact that he is running for prime minister and the free-spirited Daphne could be a liability. But, with the same advisers in place, will Daphne be sent packing, too? And, does Henry truly love his intended or does he still harbor feelings for Libby, being unaware of why she left him in the first place? This is a lovely, funny, touching story with fairy tale elements. Who would not want to suddenly go from a walk-up apartment in Chinatown to a stately mansion, complete with servants, deep pockets, and titled relatives, in London? As the buoyant and sweet Daphne, Bynes turns in a wonderful performance. She gives American girls a good name and, sister, can she dance! Preston is likewise fine as the bohemian but lovely mother and Firth, well, he is utter perfection as the sophisticated aristocrat who, nevertheless, knows the true value of a person, not a heritage or title. The rest of the cast, including Jonathan Pryce and Anna Chancellor, is quite nice, also. Understandably, the London setting is beautiful and the production values are high. Especially noteworthy are the costumes, for they are very well chosen, with the sunkissed Bynes looking lovely at every turn. If you thought this film was for teenage girls only, this viewer urges you to give it a try, most certainly if you are a big romcom fan. It has two love stories to tell, one for the younger set and one for the older, and after a humorous, meaningful tale, it finishes with a joyous bang that will satisfy most any soul.",What a Girl Wants
8,tabuno,"Solid, Delightful Entertainment",8,26 January 2019,"12 April 2003. This above average comedy about growing up improves on its predecessor pushing the envelop between comedy and drama, smoothly combining both elements making this movie a much more intelligent, mature, and delightfully entertaining movie. Both the teenagers and the adults in this movie get equal time and the ending isn't the result of the teenager's initiative but of the adult. The physical comedy is funny, except for the obvious take from Miss Congeniality and Sandra Bullock's fall on the carpet. The ballroom dance scene almost gets out of hand in stupidity but makes up for it in its dramatic flourish at the end. Overall, this is a well balanced and funny, dramatic movie that is a solid impressive movie. The ending is even a balanced compromise, a reflection of reality, and one that is not seen in most teen comedies. Bravo. Eight out of ten stars.",What a Girl Wants
9,digitalbeachbum,Could have been better,3,4 June 2020,"This is a good example of a production that went South and didn't return. The story was ok and casting too, script was ok, but the beliability was not there. There are moments when the movie starts to shine only to be drenched with a completely ridiculous stunt. It still ends up being only second best for Amanda, Hairspray showed her real talents.",What a Girl Wants

11,lisafordeay,I liked it,6,7 November 2010,"OK how many times have we got a movie where a guy is a mommies boy and no one is right for their precious son well this is what happens in this movie which stars Amanda Bynes,Colin Firth,Johnathan Pyrce and Kelly Preston(RIP).The story is about an American girl named Daphine(Bynes)who tracks down her father who turns out to be a Democrat in London England named Henry Dashwood(Colin Firth). So she decides to go to London to track him down,only for her to discover that he is now engaged to another woman who is a divorcee (as she has a daughter who hates Daphine)
As Henry and Daphine spend some quality time together, he decides to pick up what he was missing out on for the past 16 years. I liked the film even though its a bit boring in some places but still I liked the story as it was a Cinderella type tale,and I always liked Amanda Bynes as she is hilarious.6/10.",What a Girl Wants
12,robert-temple-1,"Wonderful, Hilarious, Wickedly Satirical, and Sentimental",10,26 October 2009,"This is just so funny! The film works because of snappy direction, perfect casting of Colin Firth, and as his daughter the delightful Amanda Bynes, who really makes it. The story was originally filmed in 1958 with Rex Harrison in the Colin Firth role and Sandra Dee as his daughter. It bore the same title as the play upon which it was based, 'The Reluctant Debutante', and was written by William Douglas-Home, who died in 1992, aged 80. It is amazing how well the social satire targets of the 1950s have held up as viable in this new version half a century later. Of course, now they are seen to be fantasies, whereas in the 1950s they were real. It is actually better and more effective that this film, which is essentially a fairytale, attacks fantasies rather than real social issues. Douglas-Home was the brother of the Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and he was personally familiar with all of the social occasions which he satirizes, such as Buckingham Palace garden parties and the Henley Regatta. These define what used to be called by socialites 'the Season'. People 'did the Season', as they are required to do in this film. But today this is all a joke. Although garden parties are still held, the Regatta still takes place, and so on, none of it means anything anymore because the social importance has wholly evaporated, and all of the events have become marginal. A handful of people may go to these things 'to be seen', but they are a dwindling and insignificant coterie nowadays. Social snobbery has long since been replaced by money snobbery, so that England is now little different from America, where money is the measure of all things, and no other standard exists. Strangely enough, people in the USA often do not appreciate how things have changed in Britain, as shown for instance by Dan Brown in his novel 'The Da Vinci Code', where he naively imagines that being called 'Sir' means anything anymore. Nowadays, to be a lord means nothing, and to be a 'sir' means even less. In this film, no one takes reality very seriously. After all, the film starts with 'Lord Dashwood' renouncing his title so that he can enter the House of Commons as an MP, and then for the rest of the film he continues to be addressed as Lord Dashwood anyway. So much for script continuity! But it is all just in fun. William Douglas-Home may have had serious satirical intentions half a century ago, but this is the Disneyesque version of all that, and it is enormously funny and enjoyable. As for Amanda Bynes, in this she is a perfect gem.",What a Girl Wants
13,vivianla,Cute Looks and English Vibes,8,27 May 2020,"Amanda Bynes looks so young, fresh and beautiful. I love her body, she looks so good in all the tighter outfits.Amanda goes to her dad's home who is running to be in politics and therefore is striving to maintain a certain image. Amanda bumps into her dad in his own home and he places her on a chair. She shows her birth certificate to the shock of her dad's fiancee and the fiancee's daughter. The fiancee's daughter's crush has his eyes on our main girl after seeing her performance at the fashion show event and at another event where she pushes him into the water. It makes me cringe the way he looks and talks about her. He warns the boyfriend to stay away from her because he is of low status. Lord Dashwood is shocked to discover he has a 17-year-old daughter he was not told about. His fiancee's daughter makes a statement on how he actually had more fun with Libby than he said.Her sleeveless, blue top with the jeans at the beginning is so cute. The ""fashion show"" event where she wore a white tank top with some sort of belt dangling was super cute and was surprised to see how nice her body is. I aspire to look like that. The cloth she tied around on top of her jeans at the marketplace she bought it from looks so cute together with the outfit she wore that day. When they are on the boat and balancing on it, those scenes really outlined her figure.Her bedroom at Lord Dashwood's home is to die for!!! It is my dream bedroom. The tiara is soooo gorgeous and cute. I love her white dress with the gloves look she had on at the party. Her mom came out and the girl asks her mom if she is actually wearing a bra.The emotion in the father's and the boyfriend's eyes looked so genuine. He looked so hurt and disappointed when he confronted about Libby leaving without saying goodbye. The boyfriend seems so genuinely sweet and nice. Their accents are cute.The characters meet at the exact same place and time in many, many scenes and in real life this is unusual.",What a Girl Wants
14,JoBloTheMovieCritic,What a Girl Wants,5,20 July 2019,5/10 - I am throughly convinced that Amanda Bynes did not learn to act until Easy A,What a Girl Wants
15,aimless-46,One Third Short of Excellent,7,13 November 2005,"""What a Girl Wants"" is a FAIRY TALE (insert ""Parent Trap"" here) so those who do not like that type of story need not watch, but just being a fairy tale is no basis for criticism. It is an updated remake of 1958's ""The Reluctant Debutante"" starring Sandra Dee and Rex Harrison, which itself was based on a 1956 play by William Douglas Home. Home is partially credited with both screenplays although he died in 1992. The basic premise is even older as the humble child who discovers a royal parent is a staple of ancient fairy tales.The current version is a pretty decent effort, you could even say that it is 2/3's of an excellent movie. It starts off nicely and proceeds in a very entertaining manner well past the midway point. You are just about to conclude that this is an extremely underrated film when the wheels fall off (insert Colin Firth whisking his daughter away on a motorcycle), from that point the film wobbles lamely along until it thankfully recovers its balance just before its final scene.The only other major problem is the cliché Yank-Brit characterizations and the exploitative use of the Royal Family in several scenes. Yanks are fun and funky, Brits are staid and stuffy, most upper class Brits are evil incarnate-with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are warned about it going in, this general stupidity is reflected by the promotional poster of an American flag t-shirt between the British guards. The exuberance of Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) would have played better if the other performances were toned down a few notches. Doubles of and references to the Royal Family are completely unnecessary and simply distract from what is supposed to be a father-daughter-bonding story.The best scene happens early, Daphne and her mother are working a local wedding when she discovers the missing groom passed out under a table. She puts ice down his shirt and when he emerges frantically twisting around to remove it, Daphne signals her mom's band to play ""Shout"" and then mimics the groom's movements. I see no basis for the criticism of Amanda Bynes in this film. She plays her high energy self and successfully ratchets back a few notches for the serious scenes. In essence director Dennie Gordon has her play two characters which is the basis of the story's theme as her character must reluctantly conform and work at being someone she is not. Under Gordon's direction and working with a skilled ensemble Bynes nails the character so well that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. She is not on Brittany Murphy's level yet but she progressing nicely. Two similar scenes really play to her strengths, the fashion runway scene and the grand entrance to the party for Peach & Pear, the film is worth watching just for those moments.The widescreen edition DVD is a great value as it has some excellent special features including an unaffected commentary by Bynes. They had a lot of audio problems during production and Bynes provides very good behind the scenes information about what the actors had to do to correct this after the actual shooting was completed.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",What a Girl Wants
16,Kamurai25,Show me what you zigga-zig-ah,6,7 June 2020,"Decent watch, could watch again, and can recommend.It's not the greatest movie, but it's a charming combination of ""fish out of water"" and father-daughter reconnection. Amanda Bynes has a quirkey enough style to contrast the upper class English.Honestly ""Princess Diaries"" does the fish out of water bit better, but this has very different motivations. I personally like the friction Amanda Bynes has with her English peers over Anne Hatheway's lack of confidence dealing with adults.I don't think you'll enjoy this is you don't like Amanda Bynes, she carries most of it.",What a Girl Wants
17,RNMorton,"Wow, like lighten up",8,18 April 2004,"The folks banging this movie have to get real.  It's about an average girl (Bynes) who gets to meet her dad, who's in the process of running for major political office in England.  It's not about Yankee superiority over the Brits (sheesh!), it's a simple fantasy about the effect a teenage girl has on her once-stuffy dad in stuffy society.  If you're politically offended by this movie, imagine Amanda as a carefree Portugese girl visiting her long-lost dad, a member of U.S. Congress from Massachusetts, and chill out. That being said, Amanda Bynes is a cool and attractive leading lady/girl and plays very well with the other characters in this film.  It's all been done millions of times before, and it's not Oscar material, but it was a pleasant diversion for me.",What a Girl Wants
18,rps-2,A stunning victory for American bad taste,5,13 April 2004,"Okay, it's amusing enough and it is something of a modern day fairy tale not meant to be taken too seriously. Nevertheless the film is based on the arrogant and patronizing notion that the American way is superior, the British way inferior and that Britain may yet be saved if only it adopts American bad manners, sloppy dress, vulgar music and impractical proletarianism. I wonder if US audiences would warm to a film that portrayed them as negatively as this film does the Brits. I also wonder if  this film has played on British television and, if so, what the audience reaction there was. Having said all that, it did offer a chuckle or two and the portrayals of Prince Charles and the Queen were exceptional.",What a Girl Wants
19,Rogue-32,Charming and charmed,9,9 June 2003,"""What a Girl Wants"" is a re-tooling/re-telling of William Douglas Home's ""The Reluctant Debutante"" with the devastatingly charming Amanda Bynes in the title role; in fact 'charming' is the operative word here -everything about the movie is charming, and charmed.The casting: impeccably superb.  Amanda never hits a false note throughout the proceedings, creating a character who is genuinely believable, lovable and worth cheering for (there was a LOT of clapping in the theatre at various points in the film - I clapped AND whistled, myself); Kelly Preston is radiant as Daphne's mother Libby, a musician who still deeply loves Henry, Daphne's father, but has gone on with her life, and Colin Firth (as Daphne's father, Henry Dashwood) is a revelation here, in that he literally becomes more and more attractive as the tale unfolds - as he becomes more and more who he really is underneath his repressed exterior (the scene where he dons his black leather pants and prances in front of the mirror to the horror of his prim prude of a fiancee is priceless), and Oliver James as musician Ian, Daphne's love interest, makes a memorable splash here as well. Everyone else is perfect in their roles too (even the dog rocks). 
The screenplay and direction: completely on the mark.  Never gets heavy-handed, contrived, mean-spirited, cloying or tedious, believe it or not.  The charm is sustained throughout in a dazzling balance of comedy, heartfelt emotion, conflict and growth, culminating in one of the most satisfying resolutions I've experienced in a movie in a long time.Occasionally, a movie can have predictable elements without that being a bad thing; sometimes predictable elements can be pleasurable -- you realize what's going to happen but you also realize you're in such capable hands that you actually anticipate the playing-out of the scenes you know will occur.  Sometimes it's not WHAT is done in a movie but HOW it's achieved, and WHO is doing the achieving.",What a Girl Wants
20,FilmOtaku,This girl wanted to know why.why?!,2,25 August 2004,"I don't care who wrote or directed 'What a Girl Wants'. This movie was horrible and even the act of looking the film up on IMDb would mean wasted time and keystrokes. So why am I taking the time to review it? Well, because I made a promise to myself to review every film I see, and damn it, I saw this one. I only have myself to blame. I watched this film willingly while on a mini-vacation. I liken the film to watching a carnival ride get stuck; you really don't want to watch the horrifying image before you, but you just can't help it. The story (story??) is such formulaic tripe that is an insult to any four year old. Homogenous teen queen Amanda Bynes plays Daphne, a girl who longs to find out who her father is, despite the fact that she's gone without this information and has an artistic mom who affords her a lot of freedom, as all single artistic moms in the movies do. Unfortunately, her mom is played by Kelly Preston, so I can understand why she would see what her other options are. She discovers that dear dad is actually Colin Firth, who is a British politician, so she flies over there and decides to descend on his household; wreaking her own cutesy American brand of havoc on the stodgy British. I'm not sure there is a stereotype left that could show how boring the British are compared to the free-spirit and frosted eyelid-ed American girl who has many scenes that resemble tampon commercials where she dances in front of mirrors while she tries on clothes with some saccharine pop music plays in the background. Honestly, the only thing that kept me watching this train wreck was the continuous speculation as to why Colin Firth would debase himself to appear in this film. Not just appear in the film  there is a scene where he is dressed in leather pants and playing air guitar in front of a mirror  for about fifteen long, excruciating seconds. I was so embarrassed for the guy at that point I considered sending him whatever cash I had in my pocket in hopes that it is a start for him to pay those bills that he obviously needed to cover, or else I can't fathom why he would do something like this. It's more interesting to imagine how the story turns out instead of me telling you, and even better, I could give you a Choose Your Own Adventure. Turn to page 47 if you want Amanda Bynes to get hit by a bus by a good actress like Maggie Gyllenhaal. Turn to page 48 if you want to slip $5 to an Intern at the film studio that released this piece of crap and have he or she burn the master print. Or finally, turn to page 49 if you want everything to turn out in the end, as these films always, horrifically do. I hated this movie with every fiber of my being. --Shelly",What a Girl Wants

Every scene is fun and hilarious.The acting is convincing and draws me in. And the chemistry between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth is outstanding. Amanda Bynes really shines in this role as Daphne. Kelly Preston and Oliver James also did a wonderful job.
Overall, it's a heartwarming film to watch with the whole family.",What a Girl Wants
22,AngelHonesty,Cliche,5,11 January 2020,This movie is filled with cliché upon cliché. The story is basically a bad parody of Cinderella. The lines are super cheesy and the acting isn't the best. Colin Firth is entertaining to watch as he is the only decent actor on this film. The overall idea of the movie; a girl trying to connect with her father and just being yourself is a nice idea to portray. But everything else in between was poorly done. The movie does make a nice film to just waist some time and feel good afterwards.,What a Girl Wants
23,rebeljenn,A sappy film,4,10 October 2005,"What a Girl Wants is a feel-good, dreamy, and unrealistic scenario involving a teenage American girl who wants to be a princess and who succeeds in being welcomed into the upper class British circle and being considered 'cool' at the same time. What young girl does not want (look at the title) to be a princess and to be beautiful and admired, very much like Cinderella? Despite being a 'loud American', Daphne succeeds in being adored over her stuck-up soon-to-be step-sister and being the centre of attention, much to the regret of the Paynes who have an eye on her father and his political career and social standing. But, in the end, everything works out for Daphne and her parents. It is one of those happy love stories with a rags-to-riches tale.What a Girl Wants is a film that displays what the typical American thinks of when they think of Britain...a very unrealistic view of Britain and filled with stereotypes. This is what I found annoying about the film, but then it is made for an American audience. Generally, the acting was done fairly well by Firth and Bynes, but the film offers little more.If you are a young girl and like feel-good fantasy films, then What A Girl Wants if probably going to be what you want in a film. I wouldn't think this film would be anything of any interest to male counterparts, and adults would probably regard it as a waste of time.",What a Girl Wants

25,TheOtherFool,Pleasant considering...,5,9 April 2004,"Put an attractive, young tv-star in an airplane to Europe and you got your movie-hit. Where Hillary Duff went to Italy and became a singer, Amanda Bynes tries out England to meet her father, some big hot-shot up and coming politician. And those are just two movies from last year. The complete list of comparable stories is endless...We've all seen it before. Nice mom, cute girl, mean stepsister, father is about to mary to wrong woman... or maybe he doesn't? It's as cliched as it gets, but 'What a girl wants' wasn't as bad as many of those movies, nor as irritating as the 'going to Europe' 'Lizzie McGuire' movie.The big plus for the movie are it's main characters. Amanda Bynes is perfect in her role as young American girl discovering London, and Colin Firth is always a pleasure to watch (even though he played in the dreadful 'Bridget Jones' movie).A couple of things bugged me though. First off, those Englishmen have a serious security breach, with Bynes breaking in the house of a Lord and later breaking in at a fashion show with Prince Charles attending. Somehow I guess not...Biggest problem though was the 'Ian' person. We all think Bynes is gonna fall for him but she doesn't phone him, and later on she goes back to America without even saying goodbye... such an odd thing to do for a girl in love.The story isn't mindboggling whatso-ever, but I'm sure it's 'what the girls want' who like the Bynes show in the USA.

The father and the people with him are unsure what to do with the daughter, especially with the father running for reelection, he contacts her mother, who is angry with him because she was sent home and he never contacted her, and the daughter is confused about what she has done, and what she should do now, especially when she meets and falls in love with a young local man.The story might best be described as wish-fulfillment fantasy, but is pleasant enough without being too soppy or unrealistic.

Just like her show.Story: A girl left her mom stranded to go to England to meet her father (who doesn't know she exist).There are too many stuff in this movie that is really cheesy, like a boy she just met  she called him Boyfriend, who happen to get every jobs in London, who is also happen to be hired in the Lord's party to sing in the band that can play any song, just ordered!!. Also the soundtrack and the acting suck.And worst of all everything fell into place in the end which is really make it soooo irritating (because everything fell too perfectly).But not everything about this movie is that bad. It got pretty good location, wardrobe has done a pretty good job, they managed to fool Colin Firth to be in this movie, and all the camera did work pretty well.Recommendation: Yes, if you like The Amanda Show  Don't Watch It, for who don't.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D)",What a Girl Wants
28,Spanner-2,For teenage girls only,6,8 April 2003,"A silly little teen comedy with former Nicolodean star Amanda Bynes playing an American teenager who heads to England to find her British Lord father (Colin Firth, channeling Hugh Grant) who doesn't know she exists. The film is no where near as fun as ""Princess Diaries"" (a similar premise) but it's mild enough entertainment for bored teenage girls. For the rest of us, it's pretty predictible stuff and while Bynes certainly has screen presence, her acting chops need to be developed somewhat, she never really seems to be playing a character and seems to be just goofing off the whole time.

The message of this film to it's target audience of 8-15 year-olds can more or less be summed up like this: ""the rich lead boring, stupid lives, life should be a party, hard work and sacrifice is out, just have fun, be a musician, go to Morrocco and have fun, money is somehow always there anyway...

Trite theme but Amanda and Colin's acting makes the movie flow without any interruption or boredom. The movie itself is very cute and charming, but some of the lines imply existing class distinction and make me sad and gloomy.
For example, the way Armistead treats Ian is so unfair and over the line. The line ""Breeding always wins out in the end."" is really really disgusting, but the movie may need repulsive line from the Armistead for audience to root for Ian.",What a Girl Wants
31,dy158,Cute and light-hearted.,7,15 June 2006,"One of those very first few movies I watched on cable after my father subscribed to it was this one. That was like earlier this year. I have to kind of admit, the Colin Firth factor was one of those reasons. I know.Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) is this free-spirited American teenager who is from New York, and found out one day that the biological father she had never knew of till now is actually a prominent British politician. Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) did once met Daphne's mother before. But he has no idea that his American daughter is coming to visit him and chaos almost ensued the moment Daphne arrives at her biological father's house.But the thing is that, Daphne is not ready the lifestyle and culture of being a British politician's daughter. Naturally, Henry's legal wife and teenage daughter were not too pleased at Daphne's sudden arrival. Comical events soon began to follow and Daphne eventually learnt to behave like what people often though of the British to be, maybe.But, this is an American teenager trying to find out who she is really. And even the father she soon came to know and able to understand and relate to.Now maybe the whole movie is what maybe some may say - predictable, but overall it's just a light-hearted movie and to just watch some of the comical antics unfold.",What a Girl Wants

Now there are many films that are not for everybody, they do not excel in acting, directing, screenplay or effects to be called a 'good movie'. They are meant for certain part of the audience who, if it sticks to the specific formula, just love them. Now I wasn't meant to love ""What a girl wants"", but I guess, thinking from my point of view, it's a good diversion from me.The script is above the level I was expecting and young Amanda Bynes acted quite well. Colin Firth seemed a little wooden. There are bits of little innocent humors in places that makes it a relief to watch. The shooting locations and the sets are fine. The soundtrack too is catchy. So even the storyline is very very shallow, one should not complain or analyze too much about such films.",What a Girl Wants
33,Cedric_Catsuits,Messy but cute,7,1 July 2006,"I'd like to know how many different countries this was filmed in, because although it's portrayed (presumably to American audiences) as England, much of the exterior, and virtually all of the interiors, bear no resemblance to anywhere in Britain that I know of! That, and the formulaic, stereotyping of the Brits (stiff upper-lip, arrogant toffs, and laughably posh, cockney cheeky-chappies) being infiltrated by cool, fun, down-to-earth American princess-in-waiting (all been done many times before) make for a rather yawn-and-vomit-inducing experience for the more enlightened (from both sides of the pond, I imagine.) All this is hampered further by poor lighting, direction, and script.So it's definitely one to miss, then? Well no, actually. Such is the brilliance of the casting of the unknown (to most Brits) Amanda Bynes opposite Colin Firth, I forgive this movie all it's sins. Bynes is simply delightful - a cute, bubbly, beautiful, electrically-charged ball of charm and energy. Firth seems to feed off this, and the scenes involving these two work just perfectly. There are some other very accomplished actors on show, but they have been fed scraps here by comparison. It's as if all the best scenes were reserved just for Firth & Bynes. It's a shame because, despite the rather low-budget, familiar, safe, family-friendly feel to this movie, it shows signs that it could have been something quite special.Firth excels in parts, showing some real depth. Bynes gives a mature, show-stealing performance, and she alone makes this movie worth watching. If ever a movie owed so much, to so few, then this is it.",What a Girl Wants

Colin is what is going to attract women to this film, and he does not disappoint.  He is the best thing about the movie.  Amanda Bynes is cute, and I enjoyed her too. The rest of the cast is quite good too...Anna Chancellor (Caroline Bingley, for those Pride and Prejudice fans...), and Eileen Atkins, particularly.  I found the storyline about the daughter longing for her father and the father who just discovered her quite sweet and moving.  Yes, the script was a bit sloppy and the humor often falls flat, but overall, Colin Firth's performance made it worth seeing for me.  This is definitely a chick flick, though :)",What a Girl Wants

To be honest, I liked this movie much more when I was younger. Everything was funnier back then. It goes to show that the humor in this movie was targeted towards a younger audience. But aside from the humor, the romance between Daphne & Ian and the father-daughter relationship between Henry & Daphne was very heartwarming.The thing about Henry and Daphne's relationship is that it is very realistic. There are many people in this world who have never known at least one of their parents- whether it be because of an unfortunate death or an ending in a relationship. Here, we are introduced to Daphne who- because of her determined mind- meets her father for the first time in 17 years. We see their relationship blossom slowly, but beautifully. Relationships take time to build, especially if you're forming it with a relative who you've just met- like say a father or a daughter. The relationship between the two was done perfectly in this movie.However, Colin Firth is just too good lucking to be seen as ""just a father"". Hit me all you like, but I really could sense some hidden sexual attractions there. It was almost like a romance film! But with Ian, I guess that saved the day. But seriously, if you looked at it carefully, you'd see it.Good movie. Very heartwarming. It makes me look forward to my father-daughter dance in my future wedding. :)",What a Girl Wants

I have read some reviews saying how bad the English look? Trust me, the English Actors Colin Firth ( Lord Henry Dashwood), Eileen Atkins (His mother Jocelyn), and Jonathan Pryce (Alistair Payne), come out best. Spoilers: The best part is when Dashwood finds out the truth about his Daughter Daphne (Amanda Byrnes), and how Alistar broke up the relationship between him, and her mother (Kelly Preston), for political reasons, and punches his lights out. I have read how Ms. Byrnes is a wild child, drinking and going around like another party animal... Lindsay Lohan. Here is the thing, Lohan can't act, but her performance in ""The Parent Trap"" remake is Oscar material compared to Byrnes in this film. If you have seen both films, and the similar plots (The girl (or girls) searching out a long-lost relative, and parents getting married all over again) you will know what I mean.

It's a sugary-sweet tale of an extroverted,American, teenage girl who wants the father she never knew andall the 'wacky' shenanigans she gets into when she goes to meethim in not-so-Merry Ol' England.   Harmless fun, typical humour, aformulaic plot, and standard acting that all concludes with anincredibly perfect ending.Amada Bynes, as the loopy and longing Daphne Reynolds, walksthe fine line in her role between being utterly precocious and mildlyadorable.  She isn't horrible, but shows no real depth of charactereither.  Colin Firth however is excellent as aspiring Britishpolitician, Lord Henry Dashwood, the shocked, reserved andadapting father of a surprise teenage daughter.  He plays itstraight, and is the anchor with any form of reality this movie canclaim to own.  Kelly Preston (the 'Mom') and Jonathon Pryce (the'Evil Aid') are given fairly paltry and one-dimensional charactersunfortunately, and the bulk of the remaining cast are basic'cartoons' in their forgettable roles.I didn't cringe at any given point, but I certainly wasn't sucked in byanything along the way.  I suppose this might be a good family filmas there were no 'boobies', or coarse language, and only onepunch was thrown during the entire thing.

This isn't a movie for middle aged men. (Who am I kidding? I could only be considered middle aged if I expected to live to be several decades past the century mark!) Still, it was sweet and charming with a disarming innocence that was totally refreshing.The plot has been more than adequately synopsized. And yes, it is formulaic in its way. Still the performances are excellent all around. You pretty much know what will happen - or at least you know what you'd like to see happen, and the script doesn't disappoint. Everyone is excellent. Amanda Bynes (who I'd never heard of before this film) more than carries the production on her amazingly mature shoulders. Others have noted that Colin Firth as her dad is ""wooden"", but that's part of the point of the film. Even the minor characters are all pitch perfect.

43,folsominc2,A Cinderella and Old-Fashioned Love Story,10,21 March 2008,"I have to say from all the movies that I have watched in the last few weeks with Colin Firth since I recently became enamored of his talent in the A&E production of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" this movie is perhaps the best one that I have seen.It has all the elements of a good movie and Firth at his best. I love the characters and relationships and how they interact with each other. Daphne (Amanda Bynes) is perfect as the teenage daughter searching for the other half of her being and life and finding her father. Her cute little smile and perky American approach no matter what is happening to her portrays her ""can do"" attitude and determination in being herself.And I just have to say that this is Colin Firth in his element! He is fantastic as the Henry Dashwood character (hmmm . . . name seems Austen-ly familiar, don't it?) who suddenly finds out he is a father after 17 years. He is tender and sweet and unsure. Probably one of the best scenes ever in the film is during the ""midnight snack"" of Coco Pops in the kitchen where he learns that his wife didn't leave him for another man and had always been his even after all the years between. The emotions and thoughts rush over his face as if he is speaking them out loud and the viewer can see his internal struggle to remain calm with the overwhelming feeling of the bitterness he had experienced for all those years.There are so many perfect and good scenes in this movie with very little bloopers that it really can touch a viewer's heart. The areas especially with Henry and his daughter are extremely special.The last part of the film is symbolic when Henry Dashwood has a heart-to-heart with his mother, withdraws his candidacy, hits the man who had affected his life so extremely, and then walks into the bright sunlight with a deep breath. The viewer realizes that it is more than just being outside in the sunlight but that he finally came out of the dark after so many long years. He has finally found who he is and what he wants to do.Firth basically took my breath away. With the subsequent scene of him winning back his daughter and then his wife, the viewer has realized that this is one of those pictures that are forthrightly, just a deliciously good picture. This is one that makes you believe in old-fashioned love and fairy tales which seems to be so non-existent in today's film making industry.Firth has tremendous talent in saying something extremely vital by NOT saying something. Each scene where he was having discussions with Libby (Kelly Preston) either on the phone or in person, the viewer could read both characters thoughts and feelings and the amazing chemistry that existed after all that time apart.It was also better for the plot to have this international relationship struggle. If it had been in America  especially these days  the press would have made a big deal out of the girl's ""native"" upbringing but it probably would not have affected the father's political life.Everyone excelled in this movie and kudos to the director and screen writer for bringing such a sweet story to light.One last word is that no review of this movie can be complete without discussing the amazingly hilarious scene of Firth squeezing into his ""old"" black leather pants and t-shirt  and earring?  and dancing in front of a mirror. Each time that particular part plays, everyone bursts out laughing! He was just perfect! And lastly, Darcy was a gooder but Dashwood beat 'im hands down! Maybe it was because Dashwood can laugh at himself, sees the funny side of things, and chose to come into his own self-discovery of who and what he was and wanted to be.I still love Darcy but in this case, I'll take Dashwood!",What a Girl Wants

51,Vinny37,She got what she wanted,7,23 May 2020,"A pleasant enough teenage romp. Based around the myopic Western paradigm that marriage is created by a societal authority (eg church or tribe), it's not recognised that Henry Dashwood (high society) and Libby Reynolds had truly married. Like having a roadside fix on a car awaiting a garage fix later, they had assumed that they had something like a local marriage (by a Bedouin tribe that officiated their wedding), and intended to get 'properly' married upon his return to England.In England, someone unhappy with his wife's free-spirit character separates the couple, and Libby returns stateside, where unknown to her husband she has their child, Daphne. Both spouses believe that the other party wishes to be better off without them-Henry doesn't know that Libby was carrying their child. Daphne is raised with a strong yearning to have her father (not just some DNA link, but a history and paternal love) in her life, and eventually travels to London, just in time to cause issues to his political and marital aims, and issues for the woman (presumably merely a Western fiancée) seeking to politically marry him. Politically, will Daphne be a liability or an asset, is one question. Should politics trump family, is another question faced.Showing herself capable of self-sacrifice (but no one had doubted it), Daphne at one point puts her father before her exuberant nature, although realising later that repressing it was a meritorious though misguided sacrifice-I think of the ""I love you just the way you are"" song. Her own love life at times rocks (Ian Wallace), a lad of some loyalty and daring.The questions of what constitutes marriage, and what constitutes just divorce, are assumed, not explored, and the film flows at the level of romance rather than of ethics, although the latter is carried by the film. At the end, ethically, neither spouse had created any grounds for a just divorce, so after separation their talk of remarrying was misplaced but romantic.There are some cheeky moments in the film (like 'em or loath them), no F-words, and a lot of justified feel-good moments and comeuppance. Eventually Daphne (and her mother and father) get what they want, and you might think that politics would have been the better had it promoted them.",What a Girl Wants

Well, it is, except for two elements. The first, Colin Firth is on a rampage as the new quintessential British aristocratic leading man and he nails this one yet again. Second, Amanda Bynes' character is written up with a surprisingly down to earth, non-self centric and in fact cheerfully bright and enthusiastically altruistic disposition, that is neither air-headed ditsy, not standard issue bitchy, self obsessed and vanity driven nor even an overtly docile, shy and demure type. This refreshing characterization is far more realistic than stereotypical characterization, which sort of streamlines teenage girls into only one or the other, which in reality, like all other people, they too have a bevy of emotions, intellectual needs and altruistic abilities.

To some degree, I don't mind recycled formula. Movies have to be kept current, so kids of today can relate to them.  This movie touched my daughters' hearts, and if a movie can touch someone, no matter how sappy it is, then in my opinion, it does work.Yes, they made Amanda Bynes an outgoing, uncontained, accident-prone, high-spirited girl.  Unfortunately, that's what they do to try to amuse the younger set.  I see a lot of trailers with other similar characters, but the movie is about finding true love in long-lost family.  It was a cute fairy tale.I did give this movie a 5/10 because I have seen better, but I would not put it at the bottom of the list either.",What a Girl Wants
57,michaelgrantham,Excellent Feel-Good Movie,9,3 March 2005,"Thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy! Amanda Bynes was excellent as the teen daughter, with a wonderful impish smile and a very mature performance for a youngster. Colin Firth was good in a ""Hugh Grant"" style part, but played very well and very believably as the father. There were some genuinely tender moments between him and Amanda Bynes, as his daughter, and also with Kelly Preston as his estranged ""wife."" The soundtrack was foot-tapping with excellent songs by Kelly Preston and especially by Oliver James as Amanda's boyfriend, Ian (singing his own compositions).A very under-rated movie with some laugh-out-loud moments. I'm very surprised it didn't rate higher with IMDb voters!",What a Girl Wants
58,costafic,Bynes did not try to act,5,17 March 2020,Watching old Amanda Bynes films is hard. You realize that where you once found her likable suddenly she appears cheap and inauthentic. Her lazy acting style was so painful I just couldn't make it through this movie.,What a Girl Wants
59,CaptHayfever,"Trailers stank, Movie shines",7,5 April 2003,"I went into the theater today expecting a good movie. I was wrong. Why was I wrong? Because this was a GREAT movie!!!The trailers made this film look INSANELY cheesy.  Since I know from experience that trailers are highly inaccurate, I was expecting a PARTIALLY cheesy flick. But what I saw had almost no cheese to it at all. What A Girl Wants, despite its unfortunate title, is what a LOT of people want, combining drama, comedy, romance, and self-discovery in an hour and 45 minutes of enjoyment.I didn't say insight, mind you, I said self-discovery. This is purely a narrative, not a deep thought movie, and it wouldn't have worked any other way. Kudos to Dennie Gordon for not trying to accent a theme that we're already familiar with, rather, she just throws it into the story, almost casually, so that we see the message of individuality but aren't repulsed by an overly blatant moral.Many of this film's detractors say that it's a rip of The Princess Diaries. Not true. Yes, it's an adaptation, but it's based on ""The Reluctant Debutante"", which was around for DECADES before Diaries was even conceived. Besides, while it is a little formulaic, there are a few twists.
Many say it portrays inaccurate American/British stereotypes. Not true. Daphne and her mother are CLEARLY presented to be NOTHING like the average American, and Lord Dashwood only behaves so properly because of his political position.Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds finally gets a chance to show of her incredible dramatic skills. (Moody's Point had too much of a satirical tone to properly show this.) Bynes has her glory moments of comedy alongside her touching moments as the girl who wants to understand who she is.Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood. Come on, who didn't already know Firth kicks butt? He is the center of every scene Bynes isn't in, and he carries that weight well.Eileen Atkins as Lady Dashwood does a tremendous job with her supporting role, who is far more crucial to the plot than anyone expected.Oliver James handles his theatrical debut well, showing much more emotion than the previews indicated. Libby Reynolds isn't a fully round character, but that's the script's fault, not Kelly Preston's. Both are capable singers, and considering that Bynes's one major performance flaw is lack of musical ability, I'm glad these two sang instead of her.
In fact, basically the entire cast here was superb.See it, you'll be glad you did. Fine entertainment for almost everybody.",What a Girl Wants
60,Loz8,"Not perfect, but pretty darn good!",10,4 April 2003,"I was really surprised at some of the nastier comments on this film but then I remembered my planned review of ""What a Girl Wants"" before I actually went to see the film. *What a Girl Wants is her one hour seventeen minutes of her life back* And yet - that is not my opening line. Why? Simple. I loved the film! The trailers for ""What a Girl Wants"" just don't do the film justice - they make the film seem like typical pre-teen fodder, starring a ditzy and sickeningly sweet idiot. However, don't be fooled by lax advertising. ""What a Girl Wants"" provides many moments of pure, light and highly enjoyable entertainment I wouldn't trade in for all the gold in the world.
First of all, the character of Daphne is actually very likeable, and not a ditz at all (well, no more that other ppl). She has a very real longing to know her father and a very touching way of expressing it. I was surprised at how good an actress Amanda Bynes really was. I had heard all the horror rumours of her show, and yet she proves she's actually very talented.
Second - there is a character hardly mentioned in the trailers I saw - that of Ian. He was played artfully by Oliver James and provided a love interest for our leading lady. Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood was skilled casting, and I loved him in this film. He gives the film soul. It could easily have become an utter mess if it wasn't for his expert depressed gazes and well timed smiles. Once again, he takes over the film. We switch from Daphne's to Henry's point of view seamlessly. When Henry casts off his carefully cultivated serious countenance we see he is as much of a wild child as his daughter. Scenes between Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth were really quite touching.
I disagree that ""What a Girl Wants"" is only for pre-teens (altho they will enjoy this film) but I go agree it is a chick flick. However, chicks of all ages will enjoy this film ;)There are of course, some flaws in ""What a Girl Wants"" - some of the jokes don't quite work, and there is a distinct lack of trying to make us believe what is happening on the screen is really happening - but who cares? For a light-hearted frothy film, ""What a Girl Wants"" does a very good job of uplifting the spirits.",What a Girl Wants

62,provita-11142,A cute nonsense movie,2,22 May 2021,"A movie made by people who have no knowledge about the British aristocrats nor New Yorkers.The movie could have been better if they would have stayed true to the life and expectations.For one, no way a Wedding musician and waitress would live in a luxury apartment of New York City, especially not in Chinatown. A studio would have made more sense. Now, Libby, I will give her the benefit of doubt but its no secret that musicians tend to be sexually active, drug addicted, and alcoholic - Eliminate three if a few boyfriend were around then I might have believe it more, but this celibate nun act is more false than Whoopie Goldberger's locks.Let move over to the other side of the pond, there is no way in hell Glynnis and her daughter plus her father would be living in the Dashwood residence as it would be highly inappropriate since she is only the fiancée and not the wife of Lord Henry Dashwood.Second, Glynnis and Clarissa would never behave in such matter. This is a supposed British aristocratic family, so they would have been prime and proper at all hours and teach Daphne the protocol instead of letting her act like a buffoon. Any negative feeling toward Daphne would have been repressed.Jocelyn would have embrace her newfound granddaughter with a hug and have her under her wing.Also Jocelyn would never be so careless to skeet shoot at the Dashwood residence that is supposedly near the city and many servants and maids around for a potential murder.The coming out party would never have paparazzi nor would there have been a barbaric announcement of titles nor be addressed as Mulberry Chinatown. She would simply absorb her father title.Learning how to balance on a fishing boat is so ridiculous. Such amateur thinking.Armistead is a complete made-up character that makes no sense. Behind the scene, maybe, but in public, no way. He and his friends would rate models so openly without being scorned. He would never flirt with Daphne so publicly while being engaged to Clarissa.Henry would have never dance with Clarissa on the night of Daphne's ball. Highly disrespectful and inappropriate. Henry would instead have the security search for his missing daughter.The reveal is Alistair is the one who separated Libby and Henry is a bit ridiculous considering the fact that Glynnis was probably already married, hello, did we forget Clarissa? She and Daphne are about the same age. So the time date doesn't make sense.It would be more understanding if Libby left because she couldn't handle the pressure of being a Lady and force to end her music career. That is more believable.",What a Girl Wants

I don't see why the others did not like the movie or was it simply because the movie attracts more females than the males. Anyway when I saw the movie the day after it was release, it was The Princess Diaries and Maid in Manhattan. I thought it was really funny when those people were dancing at the ball and then the chandelier had drop. Daphne Reynolds was a really cool character. She was the american teen rebel.

64,luvnsweet,"A heartwarming, delightful film",9,5 April 2003,"First off, if you go watch this movie don't expect to be ""wow"".  It's pretty predictable but it's still a good film.  I have always liked to compare books and movies.  This is certainly not ""The Great Gasby"" or even ""Pride and Prejudice"" but is more like those entertaining Baby-Sitter Club books or R.L. Stine mysteries that young teens have always liked to read.  I'm a teenager myself but I disagree that only young people would enjoy this movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see some 16 and 17 year old teenage boys in the theatre watching this film and they seemed to enjoy it too! Imagine that!  Anyway I am a huge Colin Firth fan and although I didn't expect much from this movie, it was much better than I expected it to be.  I was wary of seeing this movie because I was so used to seeing Colin in more serious roles but it provided the CF fans to see him in a role he is rarely ever in.  (Sure Bridget Jones's Diary was a romantic comedy too but CF was still pretty serious).  I had to laugh at Anna Chancellor's role as Henry Dashwood (Firth) fiancee.  For any P&P fans, you might remember her as Miss Bingley.  Is she ever going to have a role where she isn't the ""bad"" person who doesn't get the man in the end, LOL.  I have never seen the Amanda Show so this was my first time seeing Amanda Bynes act and she's not that bad. She's young and still has a lot of learn but she can act circles around Tara Reid and Sarah Michelle Gellar.  She also had great chemistry with Colin and their scenes together were touching.  Colin also had great chem with Kelly Preston and I was disappointed that there weren't too many scenes with those two.  Colin totally stole the movie away too (and my bias towards him is not clouding my judgment either since my friend who never seen or read P&P agreed he was the heart of the movie).  This is a fun movie and although there are some corny parts, overall it's a feel good delightful movie. Definitely a chick flick though!",What a Girl Wants

This is supposed to be a light hearted movie and it falls very short of anything close to enjoyable. We are constantly assaulted with LOUD MUSIC.

Remember this was a re-make of 1958 Reluctant Debutante with Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee.I liked the movie much more than I thought I would. Amanda Bynes is a natural. She is very comfortable in front of the camera. Oliver is great in his first performance. His singing was good as well.Colin Firth is so skillful as an actor. He gradually reveals his true nature, which is pure joy! He elevates the level and calibre of this movie. Did I mention how gosh darn hot he was?

69,play-me-a-symphony,"Falls way short of the expectations, and is fake",2,13 June 2020,"Pretty bad. Not horrible, and Colin Firth is entertaining to watch, but come on... Where do I start... Ok, I have problems with the story: an upbeat musician woman living in New York is celibate for 17 years, pining for a guy she left and she knows won't come for her? Give me a break. Also, the guy is engaged, but we never see him having any affection towards his fiancee. That's unrealistic as well. Going on: the main character girl and her mother look from the very beginning ""rich"" - expensive hair highlights (waitresses can't afford those), and then the girl keeps going on shopping sprees when in London - that's privileged behavior, there is no way she grew up the way they are trying to portray. Also, Amanda Bynes was really bad for that role. Even if the ""daughters"" were switched, the casting would have been better. Amanda Bynes is dull, unbelievable as a new NY working class girl, unbelievable as a daughter of a musician, and as a poor girl who finds herself in a fancy castle. Then, the ""boyfriend"" - he would have been ok, but why oh why did he have to be ""born privileged""?.. He could not be a simple boy? The makers of the film could not fathom that a ""cinderella"" could like a regular kid? This makes me sad. If I were a black person, I'd say this whole film reeks of White Privilege. Except, I am white (and don't believe in White Privilege), and this film just reeks of privilege - the way ""poor people"" are portrayed is super unrealistic, and the fact that the ""regular boy"" had to be secretly half-royalty is deplorable.Now, here is another thing that makes this film bad. It's giving false hope to all those abandoned daughters who grow up idealizing their fathers who are never ever there, and are out somewhere busy with their careers and with marrying other women (yes, I am one of those fatherless girls). The thing is, the fathers NEVER come around, and I can say that now. You wait and wait, and it just does not happen. Ever. The father would be pleasant to you at the rare occasions when you meet with him - once per five years or so over the decades - but he will NEVER be there for you. There is a good film ""Dirty Girl"" that shows the realistic side of this. And ""what a girl wants"" sucks. And, it plays to the dream of all kids of divorces that their parents would end up together. They won't and this is cruel to feed this plot line to all those kids.The only good thing about this film is the name.",What a Girl Wants

Colin Firth did an excellent job as the English Politician. It's not as bad as people say it is, they probably hate it because they think it will be like the Amanda show which it is not. I think teens can probably relate to how Daphne (Bynes) feels when she does not have her dad. I felt like it was a bit like the Princess Diaries. I would not say i loved it but it is one good movie.

The girl's real mom left her noble father before she was born as she felt her relationship with a noble would never work out. This little yank works her way into the nobleman's house and charms everyone. Good scenery and good laughs against the stuck-uppishness of upper-crust society life.

Amanda Bynes is cute and likable, Colin Firth and Kelly Preston are perfect, and Oliver James is a a delight. Yes, it's predictable, yes it's a formula romance, BUT, who cares? Every movie doesn't have to be cutting edge and innovative. (I enjoy that, but definitely NOT all the time. Sometimes you just want to watch something nice).

If you take it for what it was meant to be, without looking for deeper meaning than you actually get caught up in the story and characters. I found myself just letting go and enjoying the ride. I can understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you want to chill and have a good time then this movie certainly delivers.

She's such a brat, you just want to smack her.The whole stereotypical 'American shows Brits how to love life and not be so stuffy' plays out in the stupidest way, especially at a dull party where Amanda shows everyone how to dance. Naturally, they all break into a choreographed dance. Words cannot convey how embarrassing this whole scene is.

As you can see, the movie, ""What a Girl Wants"", released in 2003, is about a talking camel (voiced by James Earl Jones), who dons the voice of Thurl Ravenscroft, and he likes to sing, romp, and frolic throughout the deserts of Morocco. Accompanying the talking camel is a talking snake (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), who follows the talking camel around. The people of Morocco got terrified of the talking camel, just by taking one good look at him, and spread the news from village to village, thinking the camel is possessed by a demon. The king of Morocco (played by Omar Sharif) wants the beast to die, and sends his hunters to search everywhere, and track down the talking camel. At one point, the talking camel sings ""Poor poor Joseph, Whatcha gonna do? Things are bad for you. Hey, Whatcha gonna do?"" and he spits. The talking snake then sings, ""Poor poor Joseph, Sold to be a slave. Situation's grave. Hey, Sold to be a slave."" At this very end of this movie, the talking camel got killed, and the people of Morocco are safe and sound, so is the country, and they had a big celebration in honor. This movie's story is somewhat like a reminiscent of that of the Disney cartoon, ""The Whale who Wanted to Sing at the Met"", as part of ""Make Mine Music"", and this movie is directed by Dennis Nolan (of ""Big Pig"", ""Monster Bubbles"", ""Alphabrutes"", ""Wizard McBean and his Flying Machine"", ""Witch Bazooza"", ""Llama Beans"", and ""The Joy of Chickens"").

And that is just what What a Girl Wants provides, critics be damned.Yes it's predictable and corny, yes it's derivative and heavily influenced by The Princess Diaries, yes it strains credibility, yes its production values are suspect, and yes it must have have run out of money when it came to creating its opening titles, BUT sometimes charm is enough to carry the day, and charm it has up to its American and English ears.
The lead actress Amanda Bynes plays cute and perky so effortlessly and naturally, you can't help but like and root for her, regardless of the lame things she might have to do and say. And there are not one but TWO Prince Charmings - newcomer heartthrob Oliver James as her boyfriend and the thinking woman's heartthrob Colin Firth as her long-lost dad.Oliver is just as cute as Bynes and as nice and sensible as a cool guy can be, and he can actually sing, too. If this role is a good indication of his charm and appeal, he has a pretty bright future ahead of him.Colin Firth plays his role with the depth, sincerity and integrity you've come to expect from all his performances. He actally succeeds in making you believe he really could be a man who finds the love child - of his one true love - that he never knew he had, and that he could change his life for them. In the hands of a lesser and less charming and attractive actor, the man would have been little more than a corny plot device. But Firth provides the heart and heft of the movie and makes his character someone you grow to like and really care about (and maybe fantasize about, too - as the fantasy father or husband, depending on your demographic).As the title makes clear, this is a film for girls, so everyone else beware, (unless you have an Amanda fixation). But it's also for girls of riper vintage - note the TWO Prince Charmings -  who should be more than willing to succumb to their princely charms.Don't go to this movie expecting the wit of Clueless or the intelligence of Ever After. It's a lightweight modern-day fairy tale which sometimes misses its mark. But it provides a diverting ninety minutes of escapism, megawatt charm from its stars, and smiles, laughs, and awws aplenty for its targeted audience.",What a Girl Wants

After seeing Pride and Prejudice, Bridget Jones, Fever Pitch, and The Importance of Being Earnest, I was just waiting for this one to come out. Well, as it turned out, I loved everything about the movie and thought all of the actors in it were great! I had not seen Amanda Bynes on Nickelodeon, and I was impressed with her as well as with the cute, young singer, Oliver James. But really, you just can't go wrong with Colin Firth.  His facial expressions and his eyes are amazing!  My mom and I both loved it, and I plan to go back to see it with my teenage daughter.  It is a wonderful romantic comedy!

The scenery is great (what's not to love about London)? And Firth and Bynes were adorable. Colin Firth is great no matter what movie he's in, but Amanda Bynes (I've been a fan of hers since she was on Nickelodeon) was fun to watch and a perfect fit for the role of fun-loving Daphne. The rest of the cast was good as well, I loved the jokes that were thrown in and the silly/cute subplots going on (Peach and Pear). I appreciated that this movie didn't take itself too seriously, yet was certainly not all fluff or nonsense, either. I loved how this movie primarily dealt with a father-daughter relationship (so refreshing from other so-called teen movies that often only deal with a teenage romance) and I also loved how the main character, Daphne, was not angry or angsty, she was refreshingly fun and optimistic. Overall this is a good, clean fun movie that can be appreciated by all ages and audiences.",What a Girl Wants

Amanda Bynes has a show called the Amanda Show its really daft and full of nonsense so it was good to see her play a realistic role and it has a mix of humour and seriousness in it! You may not want kids below 7 or 8 to see it because they won't understand it and they may get bored. I really enjoyed this movie!

Just because people act ""proper"" doesn't mean they're suppressing themselves. It's not realistic to act the way you want and disregard every rule that obviously keeps society in harmony. Daphne just comes in and ruins everything for everyone. Her dad's political career struggled solely because of her acting like an ill-bred. She is incredibly inconsiderate and immature beyond her years. The only entertainment we got out of this movie was from laughing at how weird and wrong the plot felt.

Oxford Blues is one obvious previous example of the formula (and probably a hundred times better movie) but there are plenty other examples of Hollywood Takes Revenge for Colonialism.In this case the acting was hammy (just what Colin Firth is doing in this movie is hard to say - probably just hard up), the whole story completely predictable from start to finish, the plot so full of silly holes it got boring - even looked to me like the director was bored.There were some nice gems. Old Lord Whatsisface waffling pompously on about his chandelier raised a smile, and I enjoyed Lady Dashwood's comment ""No hugging! I'm British - we only show affection for dogs and horses"" (another American misconception: should have been English, British refers to four quite distinct nations, and the Scots are not noted for showing affection for horses) - but in general this really wasn't much of an anything movie.

100,ckrebs-1,So bad it isn't even funny,1,19 July 2007,"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a shame that Colin Firth agreed to appear in it, although at least we came to see a lesser known part of him: that of the leather-clad arm-swinging Angus-Young-style-jumping former rock musician.Sorry, but Amanda Bynes can't act. This would not be so noticeable in your average teen flick; the problem here is that her ""charm"" supposedly makes her be the object of attraction for a whole bunch of lads - even a cranky old princess gets fond of her, although the lady seems to like no one else, apart from her lapdog. Mmm...I immediately distrust any movie in which the transformation of a character is shown not by virtue of the plot or acting skills, but simply by a change of wardrobe and hairstyle. Scene #1: Amanda Bynes in jeans and T-shirt - the ""free, fun and relaxed"" teenager. Scene #2: Amanda Bynes in long evening dress - the composed young miss with a circumspect expression on her face. She has changed! Has she? Mmm...This brings to mind a previous comment by another user: ""why does Amanda Bynes insist on one of those crap 'dancing like a berk while trying on clothes' montage scenes in every film she's ever made?"" Yes, in fact, why are these 'trying on clothes' scenes in so many teenage films? Probably it has to do with the 'transformation of character' I mentioned before: the theory of filmmakers is that, as a teenager, you express yourself through what you wear. And since teenagers are still building their personality, this is symbolized with rapid, successive changes of clothes. Convinced? OK, right, maybe it is just because you need 90 minutes of film and only have material for 80.Oh, and those awful ""everything fits perfectly"" parts of the plot: mom appears at the ball exactly when she has to, perfectly dressed for the occasion; sudden boyfriend Ian is ubiquitous and has 'chosen' to perform all kinds of low-profile jobs, although he attended the best schools and therefore (very convenient) has at least a piece of the necessary substratum to be rightfully considered a peer by ""Britain's snobbish upper class""; etc.Better see something else.",What a Girl Wants
101,jay-11199,Not a typical princess story,5,15 May 2020,"The humor and plot in this movie are decent and Amanda shines, hitting all the funny notes at the right time, but there's something lacking here. I think what makes this story stand out also ironically diminishes it. It might've actually been better (and done better box office wise) had it been a typical princess story or at least the ending probably should've been different.This is after all a princess story masquerading as an adorable teenage comedy. It's funny, the actress is cute, and the story moves the viewer along from one antic to another, but at heart it is a princess story and actually a Princess Cinderella story which the Princess Diaries unabashedly is, but whereas the Princess Diaries embraces what it is, this movie denies it, not even letting the princess (or Lady in this case) keep her title by the end of the story. The fact that the Princess Diaries became the more popular movie in terms of box office proves which version of the princess story audiences usually prefer.Therefore, here is an axiom for any producer considering making another one of these movies: in any Cinderella type movie, if the princess is not in her castle by the end of the movie, then you do not have a princess movie.You might have an adorable teenage comedy, but if you're selling it as a princess story, then the main character, Daphne, should've enjoyed a princess ending.Here, she goes back to being Cinderella.",What a Girl Wants

He pauses a lot before he speaks which really makes you believe he is thinking before he speaks and really sometimes doesn't know what the heck to do. It is truly what a girl wants, a father who really is a father. It is so rare to have a father like that. I know I fantasized about it as I grew up, and I am sure most people did.

The three credits towards the film are towards the other characters in the film. I would give this movie one star, but I feel bad for the other actors.

Amanda Bynes shocked me with her likeability, and newcomer Orlando James is handsome and charming enough that I'm sure he will be gracing the cover of many a teen magazine in the near future. The plot itself, about a 17-year-old girl who travels to England to meet her long lost father, is one that has been done more than once before.  The difference is that this cast makes it work.  Bynes is charming as a girl trying to get along with the father she's never known, and Firth shines once again as Lord Henry Dashwood, struggling to form a relationship with the daughter he never knew existed. The ending is as cliched as one would expect it to be, but at the end, you're so happy for the characters to get what they want that the cliche no longer matters.",What a Girl Wants

It's a fluff piece; syrupy sweet with fantasy frosting.  Enough to give you a mouthful of cavities by the time you leave the theatre.  And then there's the underlining drama, which really isn't all that dramatic.But then, seventeen-year-old Amanda Bynes, with her silky long hair, puffy cheeks and baby doll eyes is able to draw our attention away from such details.  The all-American girl, she breezes through this movie, almost dancing, with a delicate grace that pacifies us, an energy that makes us smile.But Amanda is unhappy.  She has been raised well by her mother but has never met her father.  While catering weddings with her mom, she's seen her share of Father-Daughter dances.  As she watches, she is reminded that she'll never enjoy such a moment.  It breaks her heart.So she decides to hop a plane and pay her old man a visit!  In London! Let the hijinks ensue!Along the way, she meets Oliver James, a young British heartthrob who gives a fine performance as a mysterious bad boy musician.  She falls for him. And there's Jonathan Pryce, who is wonderful at twirling a mustache--if a bit obvious.  Too bad he's underused.  Kelly Preston also makes a few appearances as Amanda's wedding-singer mom, but again, not enough of them.The real compliment to Bynes (as is intended) is Colin Firth.  He's great as her long lost dad, who just happens to be a British Lord.  He was once a carefree spirit who threw caution to the wind.  Now he's a stuffed shirt with a stiff upper lip.  And guess what!  He's engaged to be married.  His fiancé is equally uptight with a daughter of her own (can you say ""evil step sister?"").The story isn't new.  In fact, it's the latest in a long line of ""Reluctant Debutante"" knockoffs.  The fairytale concept is all too familiar: beautiful young girl from modest upbringing seeks out long lost father.  Will he accept her?  Can she find a place in his life?  Will he want her to change? Will she change him?  (Will she knock evil sis on her royal butt?)  Will they live happily ever after?I dare not reveal!  No!  But then I really shouldn't have to.  The plot is predictable.  The characters: cliché.

115,opus125-1,An American view of Britain?,6,13 October 2006,"'What A Girl Wants' narrates a series conflicts speeding to an inevitable explosion that could have been resolved by common sense communication. Vivacious young American Daphne Reynold's (Amanda Byne) comes to Britain to find her reserved aristocratic father Lord Henry Dashshwood's (Colin Firth) however her arrival come at a difficult time. Henry who never knew of Daphne's existence following the unexpected departure of her musician mother, Libby (Kelly Preston), is 17 years on newly engaged and has just declared his candidacy as Prime Minister of Britain. In some ways each character is reacting to his/her own uncertainties, the political expectations of Henry's upcoming election is a hard burden on a young girl still trying to find her self and wanting to know her father in a foreign land. This contrasts with Henry's carrying the weight of 6 centuries of family expectation. Following a series of social disasters, which the Press record effecting Henry's electoral chances, Daphne attempts to change her self artificially. In reality Daphne is never told she must change (after all, she could simply moderate her behaviour in public settings) whereas she crushes her vibrancy. Henry has to appease the expectation of a political party and the voters. He simply does not know how to say no, in reality he is not leadership material, but is blindly a puppet to his conniving adviser and future father in-law Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce) , fiancé Glynnis (Anna Chancellor), and future daughter in-law Clarissa (Christina Cole) who desire to be a part of the British establishment but are threatened by Daphne's presence. Added to the mix is a young friend Ian Wallace bitter at the establishment of which his mother had once rejected. Well intentioned, Ian lacks expects Daphne to drop everything. For example, he expects her to drop the Queens garden party and go to a concert. It is loosely based on the 1958 comedy The Reluctant Debutante starring Sandra Dee. The play and 1958 screen play were written by William Douglas Home, the son of the 13th Earl of Home whose oldest brother was Prime Minister and 14th Earl Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and who was obviously in a position to understand British aristocracy. Sadly the movie seems to stereotype Britian, presumably with a U.S. audience in mind so much that it makes blatant cultural errors in its presentation. For example, when Henry resigns his candidacy as Prime Minister before the Party faithful British flags are spreadeagled behind him in anon British manner. In the Amanda Byres commentary it is revealed that any British person who saw this would be ""upset"" with it. Although not British, I felt that in criticising those who exploit society to get ahead, it perhaps unintentionally criticises British establishment for an American audience. In this respect it reminded me of Princess Diaries II dig at royalty. But then British films often have subtle send ups of American politics (e.g. Love Actually). Another humorous error is the claim made by Henry's mother Jocelyn Dashwood, Countess of Wickham, that the Dashwood family motto is 'Qui Patitur Vincit'(He who suffers conquers/He who conquers endures) or as she states ""It means, ducky, hang in there and you'll rock!"" It sounds good for the story, but in reality there is none! (Atleast according to the knights and heraldry website). Both Colin Firth and Amanda Bynes are perfect in their contrasting roles of uncertain, British idealism and American vivaciousness. I am particularly impressed with the performance of Eileen Atkins who plays the family matriarch Jocelyn Dashwood. In a scene consoling Henry she caresses him and yet also withdraws her hand advising him not to follow the family sacrificing itself to the battlefields of Europe lest he ""sacrifice your heart, Henry."" Her reservation of physical contact captures the essence of a conserved Brit. The fears of parenthood are nicely expressed by Libby when Henry panics when their daughter unexpectedly goes out with Ian: Libby: ""Strange how easy it comes isn't it?"" Henry: ""What?' ""Worrying."" ""Does it ever go away?"" ""No.""On the other hand, I found the 'us and them' contrast between two cultures two obvious annoying, as I did the youthful lack of balance of the character Ian Wallace.",What a Girl Wants

Her girl-next-door good looks and effusive smile shine through the lens and light-up every scene of `What a Girl Wants.'  The director uses Amanda's vibrance effectively to contrast the staid, stiff English aristocracy of which her father, Lord Henry Dashwood (Collin Firth), is an up and coming politician.Daphne arrives in England to meet the father she's always wanted but never knew just as Henry is poised to become England's next prime minister. Her arrival is none too welcome in the eyes of Henry's plotting fiancé, her sinister daughter, and her father who, as handler of Henry's political career, stands to gain significant social stature if Henry is only kept away from that bloody American trailer trash.  The movie spends most of its time resolving the conflicts between these characters, Daphne's mother, and a love interest played by heartthrob Tom Harper.`What a Girl Wants' admittedly shares some plot lines with other movies in this genre including `Parent Trap' and `The Princess Diaries.'  What endeared me to this movie, however, were two authentic performances, first by Collin Firth as the manipulated father robbed of the knowledge of his daughter for the past 17 years, and second, by Amanda Bynes as the daughter without a Dad seeking to put the missing pieces in place.

118,XavierAngel69,Loved it..,10,30 March 2003,"'What a Girl Wants"" : B+I absolutely loved this movie. I was truly surprised at how good it was. Afterall, it was Amanda Bynes's first movie and she was one of those Nickelodeon kid stars.The movie begins with Daphne (Bynes) growing up in New York without a father, always wishing he would come home. Her story truly begins when she can't help but think that she will never get to have a father-daughter dance, triggering her to go on a search for her father, a high political figure (Firth) in Britain.There were many times when the audience would clap and crack up at the high points of the movie, a strong sign that showed the audience enjoyed it; something I don't see too often.As the movie began to progress, I began to realize it wasn't so bad afterall; it was a great movie. Also, I should point out the fact that Colin Firth is Bynes's co-star, who is a wonderful actor.  The fact that he chose to do this movie shows that it should have some decency.There is a hilarious scene with Colin Firth dancing, a side not usually shown in his other movies.The movie also focuses on the importance of Daphne's need of a father-daughter relationship. Even if the viewer cannot relate to this situation, one can still feel for Bynes's character as she seems to be growing to be your best friend.Amanda Bynes did a surprisingly, amazing job.  She's a fresh, young hott star, as well as another co-star, Oliver James (playing her cute boyfriend).'What a Girl Wants' was a wonderful movie, that everyone will enjoy.",What a Girl Wants
119,caschell,Cinderella in Culture Clash,10,1 October 2003,"Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds Dashwood is a wonderful American Cinderella to her British would-be stepmom and wicked stepsister.  As handsome a couple as is her father Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) and her mother Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), family pressures drive them apart before their Moroccan marriage can be made legal prior to her birth.  Daphne's quest to know him surprises her father during his campaign to be elected to the legislature, and sends his blue blood Brit staff/fiancee, both power hungry and status seeking, into a panic when Lord Dashwood accepts his daughter and asks her to stay on for the summer season in the royal court.Not only is this clash between American and British cultures and language, but also the difference between aristocracy behaviors and common freedoms we Americans enjoy.  Daphne embodies the best of America:  that a money poor but culture rich girl from New York can genuinely affect the hearts of those who surround her, she who is also a graceful person, well articulate and poised, quick-witted and charmingly beautiful.  Every one of Daphne's relationships are a positive thing in her life, she truly is a role model. Genuine is her affections for her mother and for her father, as well as for her grandmother, Lady Dashwood (Eileen Atkins) Henry's mother, whom is the catalyst for Daphne's family reconciliation.A comedy of manners, a social strata education, a family reunited, and friendships abounding throughout the summer; Daphne contends with the coming-of-age crossroads with her father and new musician boyfriend, Ian Wallace (Oliver James), and the battle of wits/for her father's affections with her father's trusted advisor, Alistair, and his family--Henry's fiancee and soon to be stepdaughter.People from all ages will definitely enjoy this film.  It is wonderful to see family struggles overcome, and the family preserved by love and truth.",What a Girl Wants

What a Girl Wants was so cute and I loved Amanda Bynes and Oliver James in it.  The plot was so sweet and after I got out of the theater, I could not stop smiling.

Before that, mainly typecast in British costume dramas but this is a breakout role that has some VERY FUNNY moments in it!! Great movie for pre-teens, nothing bad in it at all.  Some of the previews for other PG-13 films weren't so good, unfortunately.  But this movie erased them - great family movie, and I definitely plan to see it again.  My daughters liked it a lot too!

130,LinzRBurrell,Is it bad that I now fancy the Fathers more than the romantic lead?!,8,11 October 2003,"7.5 / 10  ****'A good film. By no means is this film intellectually taxing, or complicatedly structured, but then, it doesn't pretend to be.It's a simple teen romantic comedy which features all of the expected codes and conventions for the genre. Anna Chancellor and Jonathan Pryce shine as the 'villains' of the piece while Eileen Atkins excels as the archetypal British Aristocrat. I can honestly see the appeal of the very talented Oliver James, especially to the young girls in the cinema when I saw the film, his presence on screen is very convincing and his musical talent is outstanding. But, is it bad that I now fancy the Father character more than the romantic lead?! Colin Firth was wonderful as usual. His charisma lights up the screen and his portrayal as the rebellious Lord was wonderful, however, it was watching him trying to get into a 1970's pair of trousers which stole the show. Well done Mr. Firth.All in all, an enjoyable easy-going film, well worth the hour and a half it takes to watch.",What a Girl Wants

Yes, it isn't very original and yes, some of it is embarassingly obvious.  That being said, I was very entertained by this movie.  I thought it was well directed, and well acted.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Amanda Bynes start taking on more serious roles in the future with great success.  This movie does what it set out to do: entertain teenage girls.  Anyone who is a fan of lighthearted tween comedies should check this movie out.

When I watch a movie more than once, it is because I feel uplifted by it and walk away with a smile on my face.  I find this every time I watch ""What a Girl Wants"".  I felt Oliver James deserved better billing as I thought he was the pivotal character in the movie.  For his first outing I thought he did a marvelous job.  There was a little magic going on between he and Amanda and would like to see more of them in the future.  I believe this movie has something for all generations, youngsters, teens, parents and grandparents. Loved it and will watch it again and again.",What a Girl Wants

Some of the comedy and storyline is a bit candy coated and far fetched...but this is easily forgiven because of Colin Firth being in the leading role, and Amanda Bynes heartwarming performance as Daphnie. We appreciate her uniqueness, and are able to root for her from beginning to end. I personally loved this film because little Amanda Bynes (""Ask Ashley"" from ""All That"") proves that she's all grown up now, and does an amazing job! She holds her own with Colin Firth, and keeps viewer interested in her character from start to finish.

There is no need to comment on Colin Firth at all, so I won't waste my time saying he is very good. But, as previously quite unknown, actor Oliver James has a starring role, which he plays fantastically. I am not the type of girl to swoon, but when I see him, and hear him play his guitar and sing, I really do melt. This film had a very fairytaley plot. It was not totally obvious as to what the conflict was going to be, but it seemed like a movie that needed a happy ending, so I was not too worried about the conflict. I admire Amanda's character, Daphne. She was so free, and so outgoing. She hardly got embarrassed, and was just full of fun.

Different from most of the fairy tales were the stars always get mistreated and abused and still remained humble and kind and passive, the stars here fight back.it's that drive that made the movie so intriguing that you don't want to skip any scenes or you might miss something. Daphnee(Amanda Bynes) was cute and full of guts not to mention sexy. she knew what she wanted, did it, and stood with it. the things she did shown her what she wants best and it's all but just to be herself. Collin Firth is sensible. He got dual personality. The one is the dignified aristocrat/politician and the other is the cool guy in him that wants to go rock. Kelly Preston was so wonderful playing the martyr mom and girlfriend. Daphnee's grandma she met only when she crushed her dad's mansion was admiring too. she even can go rock. Daphnee's boyfriend got a handsome face and did contribute a lot in the story. But the story won't be what it is if not for the antagonists. i like the role of the fiancée and the step-daughter (sorry not familiar with their names). they really are aristocrats.

It's sweet, charming, and has a fine cast.  Outstanding, of course, is Colin Firth.  The reviewers who claim that this movie is great for the ""under-13 and over 80"" crowd just don't get it.  There are many of us who will love Mr. Darcy forever, and who are in dire need of more Colin Firth movies.  He is, of course, absolutely gorgeous in the movie, and has a lot of screen time.  I would pay to watch and listen to him read a telephone book, so I will see this movie again and definitely will be among the first in line to buy the DVD.It was strange to see Anna Chancellor as his fiancee, a part which she played in much the same way that she portrayed Caroline Bingley.  Her character wasn't good enough for Mr. Darcy, nor is this one suited for Lord Dashwood.Although numerous people have criticized the sweetness of the movie, I, who am hopelessly romantic, loved its ending. I left the theater feeling better than when I entered.  (I felt the same way when ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" ended.  Actually, I couldn't wait to see it again, since the final kiss was probably the best kiss I've seen in a movie.  I digress. Sorry.)

150,theliquorstore,Cute Family Movie (?),7,28 October 2008,"What does a girl want? You might recall some things like fame and fortune, but according to this movie it's a father. A simple, yet fun, chick-flick directed by Dennie Gordon stars Amanda Bynes as Daphne Reynolds, a wild funny girl next-door trying to find her missing father. And Primetime Emmy Nominee, Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood, a well educated wealthy British politician.The movie starts out a scene with Daphne as a child, asking her mother the story on how she and her father met. The film then forwards to a 17 year old Daphne being a waitress at a wedding, feeling sad as she could not attend another father-daughter. She then decided to find her father in England. The fun starts then as she is unable to cope with her surroundings.Amanda Bynes plays another funny-fun teenager, in a comedy movie. It is not very likely to see her in a serious movie and that makes me wonder, is she not confident enough in her acting skills to take up another challenge? Or is she just smart enough to keep focusing on her current fan-base? Colin Firth on the other hand is definitely one of the up points of the movie. You might recall some of his amazing movies, ""Love actually"", ""Nanny McPhee"", ""Bridgette Jones' Diary"" and of course ""Mamma Mia"". And he has also shown another great performance on this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching.

Although it has a predictable happy ending, it's not sappy and the touch of comedy and the great acting from all the cast, especially that of Colin Firth, makes it a very enjoyable movie for all ages.

159,irondukeofwellington,One of the very worst movies I've ever seen.,1,7 July 2003,"This film is just so bad. The story is boring, the acting at times poor. The plot is so predictable and cheesy it's one of those conventional feel good crappy movies where you can see what's about to happen a mile off. As for the humour, well that just took the biscuit, the falling over and screaming done so badly no sense of funny reaction or timing, Chaplin or Stan Laurel could have taught them a load about that. I saw it for free with my media class - there's no way in hell I'd pay to go see a movie like that. I wanted paying just for sitting through it! I was embarrassed the whole way through it because it was so corny. How the hell anyone can rate this above 3 stars is beyond me.",What a Girl Wants
160,kcourtois,Better than a fairy tale,10,2 April 2003,"I saw a sneak preview of What a Girl Wants, and loved it. It was the first movie I had seen Amanda Bynes in and having never watched her on TV, I didn't know what to expect. She was terrific and the chemistry she shared with Colin Firth seemed very strong. Of course, I think Colin Firth is wonderful in everything I have ever seen him in and this was no exception.I was expecting this to be strictly the story of a girl's search and discovery of her father, but found it to be just as much about the father recovering the lost spirit of his youth. There were plenty of silly and funny moments and the movie got great audience laughs, but there were serious times too, which also seemed to go over very well.
To have a reunion such as this with a long lost parent would be a dream come true and I guess that makes this a bit of a fairy tale -- but it's certainly one that I would love to live and I intend to go back and see it again as soon as it opens, and often!",What a Girl Wants

163,fredism,"I took my 10 year old daughter, She liked it, I didn't.",5,14 April 2003,"Ok, This is fluff. It looked like a movie nearly the entire run. Even my daughter was a little bored at times. In good movies you forget that you are watching a movie. You are involved. This was like watching the Sims in England.I convinced my son to go because we thought it might be about relationships from a girl's point of view. But, no way. It was a poor imitation of an old fairy tale.. Poor girl finds out she is royal and then discovers the cost of it all.Once again the dad is made out to look like Homer Simpson instead of the way men really should be portrayed. . How could this guy let his fiance and her daughter rule him like that... Not in real life.",What a Girl Wants
164,arivas-1,My daughter and I cried.,9,15 April 2003,"For the most part, the story is formulaic and the characters seem pretty familiar, lovable American teen girl meets her stuffy royal British relatives. However, there are two reasons why this movie stands out; Colin Firth and Amanda Bynes. Bynes, the young star of the film is not only lovely to watch but brings a wholesome sincerity to her role that makes you root for her from the very beginning. Playing the lovable American teen girl is not that easy in today's cynical world but Bynes' performance seems to be stripped away of any pretentiousness or deep social commentary. She is simply a girl looking to find her father and to discover who she is. As for Colin Firth, he is simply one of England's finest living film actors and the producers of this film were extremely fortunate to have him. His character, the father who didn't know he had a daughter, could easily have been played with too much anger and lost all our sympathies, or been too much of a victim and left us wondering why anyone had ever fallen in love with him in the first place. Instead, Firth creates a multi-layered character trapped between what he aspires to be, a successful politician, and what he could be, a father. It is his character's choices that kept us interested in this film and in the end brought both my daughter and myself to tears. So, if you have a lovable teen daughter I would highly recommend this movie.",What a Girl Wants

But, I was pleasantly surprised at how much we all enjoyed it, me especially!

What A Girl Wants is a family movie, cute and funny but if your looking for a an Academy Award Winner this isn't it. It is a teen flick but my parents liked it too. I really liked Amanda Bynes in this movie more than Big Fat Liar. It is considered a rip off of the Princess Diaries but this was a lot better. Except for the fact of a few details that don't make sense (ie where did she get the money for the plane ticket )small stuff. it's a good movie.

167,shulatif,I normally like movies like this,1,27 October 2020,"Teen movies are my thing. Romcoms are my thing. I saw Colin Firth was in it and I was in. It's not like I had high expectations going into this. I knew exactly what kind of movie this was supposed to be and I was ready for it.But it's so bad. I firmly believe the screen writers were high and kept coming up with horrible plot devices to move it along after only being able to come up with a general plot to begin with. Then there's crap just thrown in because I'm sure it seemed like it would be funny when they were high. Like when she's waitressing at a wedding and finds the groom wasted under the table. First off, why is this even in the movie? Secondly, she has a plan for what? To get him out from under the table? So she puts ice down his shirt? And then starts acting like they're dancing? Why??????????????????????Look, Firth is the best part of the movie. And his mother and her mother were OK too. But this was such a big pile of nothing that they threw together like a leftover's stew.",What a Girl Wants

The script was the typical pattern. Girl meets boy, they have a fight, they get back together and live happily ever after. What charmed me were Amanda Bynes and the myriad of expressions that flicked over her face, almost faster than you could name them. I was charmed, amused and involved in the characters. After all what girl be she 13 or 33 not want her Cinderella story to happen to her.

Girl finds her father, a total British stiff, changes who she is to please her father, and decides she likes who she was. A truly Cinderella story. It's a shame there are not more movies like this. Sometimes people just need a happy ending. The cast was excellent. The snotty Christina Cole was perfect as a soon-to-be stepsister. Anna Chancellor was terrific as the soon-to-be stepmother. Worried only about herself. I have always enjoyed Jonathan Pryce and he went over the top in this movie. Acting as true British uppercuts. (And yes I've been to England-London to be exact.)

I'm a huge fan of the Briget Jones movies and I've always fancied Mark Darcy. The man is old enough to be my father... but thank god hes not! Amanda Bines was pretty funny. I've never been a fan of her TV show (The Amanda Show), but i believe she performed well. Come on guys! It's SUPPOSED to be stupid and sappy that's the whole point of these teeny bopper movies!

I've checked all the soundtrack lyrics and can't find it anywhere. It's mainly an instrumental with a jazzy trumpet and sounds sort of like a tech-no or house song. I think the words you hear go something like, ""you better keep moving, you better keep moving forward"". I liked the movie because I think that Amanda Bynes is a total hot chick. I don't like that Oliver guy whatever his name is because he looks like a little pretty boy. For one thing he has no body hair or facial hair, which makes him look like he's 12 years old. Amanda is far to hot to get stuck with such a dorky talentless actor. So if you know the song please help me out, thanks.Thanks for any help!",What a Girl Wants
174,alex_UK,Clichéd American Crap!,1,1 July 2006,"What a stultifyingly dull and inept portrayal of Britain! This movie was obviously written by an American who doesn't understand our country, and has probably never even been here (at least not for any length of time).There were so many inaccuracies, not least the total misrepresentation of our political system, and the hopelessly outmoded portrayal of our ""class culture"".This is an England that does not exist, and has never existed!Worse still was the plot, which presented a nauseatingly sentimentalised picture of family life, not to mention a hopelessly unrealistic adolescent relationship.If you want a good British movie, you'd be much better off with ""The Ghost of Greville Lodge"", or ""One Against the Wind"".",What a Girl Wants

The story has an unbelievably false plot. Besides, the jokes are incredibly stupid, I would not go so far as tosay this movie is a comedy, it is some weird hybrid between a extremely bad movie and and lame pseudo comedy. Don't watch it it is a waste of both time and money.The only good I can say is about the main character, the girl, Amanda Bynes,. she is quite a woman, but it does not help much with this kind of bad movie she is acting. I would not even compare this movie to some Hollywood classics or good comedies. Mayvbe this movie would be for teenage girls",What a Girl Wants

Girl grows up without her father, wants to see her father, but of course he's some snobbish aristocrat moving in circles she doesn't belong in. Drama, drama, drama! Naturally, as always, things turn out alright. Colin Firth instills some awe, but then: he always does.To be fair, haven't seen Miss Bynes in any other films so don't know if she always sucks this bad, but based on this one: go find another profession!Overall, *YAY* Colin Firth; *AHHH* (horrified scream) for the rest of the film.",What a Girl Wants

I urge you to buy the DVD because the extra's are great. I didn't find it a great comedy, so don't think this a comedy by any means but still it is a very moving film that a father could watch with his daughter time and time again.

178,EINJMX,Cool Movie,9,19 October 2005,"The Synopsis: This is the story of a 19-year-old girl (Bynes) who has been raised in New York City by her mother (Preston), a professional singer, who decides that she wants to find her long-lost British father (Firth) in London, who's part of a very hoity-toity British aristocratic social circle. Once she gets there, however, it doesn't take long before her hip American lifestyle disrupts his entire life. Can she find a balance in the relationship between her two parents, find her own piece of mind, and along the way, possibly fall in love as well? Perhaps most importantly, does she have a chance at being the Debutante of the Year?Ein's Point of View: It's nothing very innovative, but in a world full of mediocre, hyped, and talentless celebrities, it so wonderful to see young talent such Amanda Bynes, Oliver James, etc can really act. It's also good to know that they still make it a good movie. This is just a great dream for anyone who thinks about getting that wild hair and doing something outrageous and meeting that perfect guy and having everything work out in the end. A bouncy comedy about a New York teen who runs off to England to connect with the father she has never met.The cast was simply magnificent. Amanda Bynes finally gets to show the world her long-dormant (yet fully potent and operational) dramatic abilities. Colin Firth does the great job that is usually expected of him, it was fun to see Collin Firth in a different roll than pride and Prejudice. Kelly Preston and newbie Oliver James deliver some decent punch into their pint-sized roles, and Eileen Atkins shows some major-league scene stealin' brilliance. Really, the only BIG flaw I can see here is the title.Bynes shined as Daphne, the girl who wants more than anything to know her father (Colin Firth as Lord Dashwood. There was depth there that Bynes doesn't usually get to show as she's know for her slapstick comedy. The whole cast was bloody brilliant, each character adding a mixture of light and dark layers over the usual Cinderella story. Bynes is an appealing and energetic leading lady and Firth is always watchable, and manages to pull moments of real humor out of a basically bland role. Preston does a credible job both as mother and a singer, and newcomer Oliver James makes a sweet impression as the hard-working bloke who falls for Daphne as soon as she sets foot on British soil.The Story: The teen is Daphne Reynolds (Amanda), raised in funky Chinatown digs by her free-spirited musician mother Libby (Kelly Preston). Dad is Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a former free spirit now living by the stuffy conventions of his aristocratic roots. He's also running for office, under the guidance of Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), the same adviser who separated Henry and Libby in the first place. Henry is engaged to Alistair's daughter Glynnis (Anna Chancellor), who expects her own daughter, the snooty Clarissa (Christina Cole), to reap the benefits of Henry's position. Together, Glynnis and Clarissa do their best to humiliate Daphne, who appears to be happily humiliation-proof, no matter what.",What a Girl Wants

180,laura_n_morgan,"Not the greatest movie, but not a waste of time",7,22 March 2007,"I really enjoyed this movie. Perhaps every single thing in it isn't realistic, but you have to admire the attempt. I liked the relationship Amanda Bynes' character had with Oliver James' character. I adore both James and Colin Firth, and wish that they had given... more to both story lines.In response to one review ""he has just sacrificed what he's been working for his whole life... It's possible to do so if the movie would have pointed out that he didn't like his life.. This movie has a point which is that you shouldn't have to sacrifice your life to get happiness or something like that.... well they make that perfectly clear when it comes to the girls... but the guys have too leave everything they worked for, isn't that called sacrifice???""They do show in the very beginning that Henry, Firth's character, enjoyed being a bit of a rebel. He rode motorcycles (which, in America at least, isn't what a ""respectable"" family would do), he ran about foreign countries, saving and marrying traveling musicians... It showed quite clearly that he didn't want to be a Lord like his father.And once Daphne comes into his life, he clearly enjoys doing things that remind him of who he was before his father died.In response to the ""his fiancé already has a kid"" post, have you ever heard of this little thing called death? While I don't recall them going into why Glynnis was no longer married, I assumed that due to her father's ambitions, that she wouldn't have divorced, and that her husband had died. Some women do revert to their maiden name once their husband passes on, and I assumed that she chose to. Of course, it shows that the film makers might have put a bit more thought into her and her daughter's stories. But it's not unrealistic for an unmarried women to have a daughter.",What a Girl Wants
