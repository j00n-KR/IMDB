0,Leofwine_draca,A Skyline rip-off,4,4 August 2018,"EXTINCTION is a new-to-Netflix sci-fi thriller starring Michael Pena as a family man who finds himself striving to protect his family from an alien invasion. The first thing I thought when sticking this film on is that it was a complete copy of SKYLINE and I'm afraid that feeling never left me. However, EXTINCTION is a second-rate SKYLINE and lacks that low budget movie's suspense and excitement. This time around, the protagonist dreams of the impending alien invasion, scenes which merely pad out the first half an hour. Then some cliched action scenes take place, typically involving bad CGI explosions. Later, there's a big twist, but it's hardly surprising and it means that the last third of the film gets bogged down in exposition which is rather tiresome. Pena seems to work best in Hollywood when paired with other actors and he struggles to convince as the lead here, although it's amusing to see Lizzy Caplan battling invading aliens again after CLOVERFIELD.",Extinction
1,SnoopyStyle,Asimov with one twist too far,6,27 July 2018,"Peter (Michael Peña) has recurring nightmares about an alien invasion. His sleep-depraved wife Alice (Lizzy Caplan) asks him to get help. Then his nightmares start coming true.This Netflix flick is better than most sci-fi B-movies. The reveal of the aliens is not unexpected. From Peter hacking the gun, I figured something along that line to be revealed about the aliens. The big twist has a Twilight Zone feel and very reminiscent of Isaac Asimov. The extra bit where Peter and the others don't remember the reality of their situation is very problematic. The explanation at the end about the lost of their memories is weak. It has to contort to fit the story and it doesn't have to. They should know who they are. The twist should be a shock to the audience but there's no need for it to be a shock to them. The story would work infinitely better to play it without that bit.",Extinction
2,Prismark10,Keen eyes up there,4,8 August 2018,"I find it ironic that this film was shot in Serbia, a country whose existence was partly borne out of committing genocide.Peter (Michael Pena) is having nightmares that Earth is going to be invaded by aliens. His behaviour and actions make him seem odd and his wife Alice (Lizzy Caplan) is concerned about him.Then the aliens attack and everybody on Earth need to fight for their lives. Peter is shocked that one of the captured alien looks human. When Alice is seriously wounded, the captured alien offers to help fix her.This Netflix movie looks cheap, a large portion of the film is shot in the dark. The CGI looks dicey. It really is a made for television film.As a sci fi action film it below par, at least the screenplay has a twist to give the movie an Isaac Asimov type substance to it. It does not all add up but at least the second half is an improvement on the derivative first half of the movie.",Extinction
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Recent Sci-Fi,8,29 July 2018,"""Extinction"" is certainly one of the best recent sci-fi, with a great story and a surprising plot point. Peter (Michael Peña) has a recurring nightmare of an alien attack and like Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Total Recall"", he has a strange sensation that his dream might be a premonition. When the planet is invaded and the population is really attacked, Peter and his family try to survive and he makes the most unexpected discovery. It is very hard to write about ""Extinction"" avoiding spoilers but if the viewer likes unexpected thought provoking twists in a sci-fi story, this is the film he (or she) was waiting for. Surprisingly it is totally underrated in IMDb. Maybe the viewers have not understood the plot point. The only problem is indeed Peter´s unbearable daughters. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Extinction
4,nogodnomasters,Just a cog in the machine.,6,11 August 2018,"Peter (Michael Peña) lives with his wife Alice (Lizzy Caplan) and two daughters. He is having mental issues, seeing an alien attack on the world. People say he needs help, but is not sure something is wrong with him. Then....War of the Worlds happens. What makes the film interesting or relevant is the twist. And in case you couldn't get the societal metaphor, Peter is played by Michael Peña to help you along.Not the best sci-fi, but works. The film has to take place in a fairly distant future but doesn't have the signs of futuristic modernization. It leads us to believe it is contemporary.

5,kosmasp,Whose?,6,25 December 2020,"Anyone who would be mean might answer that question with ""your brain cells"". Of course I would never say that ... all kidding aside a quick remark to me checking the ""spoiler"" box: I won't spoil the story or even the end or any major plot points. What I will say concerns two of the characters. Since the movie is cliche or predictable as some would also call it, I actually think this won't surprise you in the least ... still checking all boxes to be safe (rather than sorry).With all that being said, the characters in question are the two kids. Now before you accuse me of anything: no I don't ""like"" or even want kids to be hurt in any way shape or form! That is in real life! But having kids in Science Fiction movies of this caliber ... well you just know nothing will happen to them and it is quite the drag. Again, I can not emphasize enough that I am talking movies here! These are not real! But it is about the suspense of a story and how you'll perceive it, how much it actually it is going to thrill you.Maybe that is not you and you still thought this worked on a larger scale (thousand bullets missing their target - heroes of the story) be damned ... This still has a neat little story it tells a quite the decent twist - although most will have figured it out by the time the actual reveal comes, it is still a nice one to say the least. Decent movie overall, but nothing that really sparked anything ... and I do love Michael Pena and Lizzy Caplan ... I love her a little bit more I must admit, but that's besides the point",Extinction
6,Sleepin_Dragon,I really enjoyed it. Expect the unexpected.,8,22 August 2018,"Half way through the film I kept thinking this is like Skyline, a film I hated, but good. As it went on however, it just got better and better, the twist comes as a huge surprise, one I certainly never expected. This has been advertised on a huge scale, and is I would say better then the adverts would have you believe.Such clever writing, it's sci fi, but so different to everything I've seen in a while, clever and imaginative, seeing the other side for a change, which makes you think about the film differently.Very well acted, with some great special effects. It's not perfect by any means, there are times where it seems to jump about so much I didn't know who was who, or what was happening. It really didn't matter though as the story itself is very, very enjoyable.It's been a while since a film has surprised me, particularly a sci fi, but this is excellent

7,paul_haakonsen,So much potential wasted by an absolutely horrible twist...,5,25 February 2019,"I stumbled upon ""Extinction"" by perusing through the Netflix catalogue of movies. I am normally not one that is overly keen on sitting down and watching Sci-Fi movies, but the synopsis for ""Extinction"" had my interest caught, so I gave it a gander.I will say that the movie started out quite nice and kept a good and interesting pacing and had a proper storyline up until the last one-third part of the movie, give or take. When it was finally revealed to the audience what was going on, then the whole movie and concept just came cascading down like a house of cards. It just made so little sense everything that had transpired up to that point in the storyline. And the armors that the visitors wore made absolutely zero sense when you come to find out what was going on.It should be said that ""Extinction"" is a movie that definitely is carried by a tremendous CGI and special effects team, because it definitely looks fantastic and very realistic, and it had a very good atmosphere to it.As for the cast, well Michael Peña really carried the majority of the movie singlehandedly with his performance. So hats off to him for what he accomplished with this movie. I was genuinely impressed with his talent in this movie.""Extinction"" is not a movie that supports more than a single viewing. Because once the big reveal has transpired, then the balloon deflates and there is zero repeatability to the movie in terms of watching it more than just a single time.All in all, a movie that had so much potential, but took a horrible blow to the face with a horrible reveal that should have served as a jaw-dropping moment. As such, then in my opinion ""Extinction"" ends on being a very mediocre Sci-Fi movie, because everything that it had built up was savagely destroyed and trampled in the last third part of the movie.",Extinction
8,CinemaSerf,Exasperation!,5,5 May 2020,"There used to be an old stage adage about working with animals and kids. Well, in this quite quirky sci-fi drama, the latter is certainly true. The girls are hellishly irritating; to the point that they really do spoil the film. Michael Peña is a father who has a recurring nightmare that he will lose his family. When aliens land and his dream is fulfilled, he has to protect those he loves. The plot has more holes than a string vest and Peña doesn't quite have the weight to carry this off by himself - he and Lizzy Caplan don't really work and the kids... sorry, I did that bit already...! It is reasonably well hung together, with decent action scenes, not too much ridiculous dialogue and it also has quite a clever twist at the end which just about justifies sticking with it for an hour and a half, but all-in-all it is just too weakly presented and oh, did I mention the children???",Extinction
9,siderite,Like a drawn out Outer Limits episode,6,29 July 2018,"It's difficult to discuss the subject of this film without spoiling it, even if it becomes kind of obvious from the half of the movie. What you need to know is that it's one of those ""twist"" movies, that base their entire existence on a plot twist at the end. Meanwhile we are left with a drawn out ""family escape"" plot with incredibly stupid little girls added for extra danger. Now, I like Michael Pena and I think he was the right actor for this film, however the script had so many holes and pacing issues that he couldn't really do anything with it. The first quarter of the film, for example, is more or less pointless to the rest of it. That is why it felt to me like it was one of those anthology sci-fi series episodes that they turned into a movie.Bottom line: in order to not spoil the subject or the twist, I am going to just say that it is a mediocre low budget sci-fi movie with a lot of plot issues, but executed rather well.",Extinction
10,Hellmant,I'd watch it if you're really bored and desperate.,5,3 August 2018,"'EXTINCTION': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new Netflix sci-fi thriller about a man who keeps having the same dream about his family being killed by an unknown invading force, and then his dreams start becoming a reality. It was directed by Ben Young, and written by Spenser Cohen and Brad Kane. It stars Michael Pena, Lizzy Caplan, Mike Colter, Amelia Crouch, Erica Tremblay and Israel Broussard. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I found it pretty dull and bland, but it's not without it's quirks though. Peter (Pena) is an engineer who keeps having nightmares of his family being wiped out by an invading alien-like force. His wife, Alice (Caplan), wants him to seek medical help for it, but Peter insists that his dreams might mean something. Then an unknown force does attack them, and the rest of civilization as well, just like in Peter's dreams. It's up to Peter to realize who he really is, and understand his full potential, in order to save them. The movie is the type of bad B-movie sci-fi flick that I would have really enjoyed when I was a kid, and I still mildly enjoyed it for that reason. The truth is though, that I was really pretty bored during most of it sadly, despite the mild nostalgic feel of it. It's also pretty unoriginal, and routine too, despite one clever main twist at the end. I did enjoy the twist though, but Pena and the rest of the cast are so wasted here, that it's kind of sad really. I'd watch it if you're really bored and desperate, only for that bad B-movie sci-fi feel, and the twist.",Extinction
11,Platypuschow,Extinction: Nice surprise,7,11 December 2018,"What is it with Netflix lately? They're taking over, everything I watch seems to be a Netflix original movie. And in some cases such as this one that's not entirely a bad thing.Extinction is an oddly enjoyable little scifi tale starring Michael Pena, Lizzy Caplan and Mike ""Luke Cage"" Colter. I went in knowing nothing and expecting very little and walked away pleasantly surprised.I'm not a big sci-fi guy and the cover certainly makes this look like a generic alien invasion film. I can assure you that it isn't, in fact it's a well constructed highly original clever little movie.Arguably it's a big ""Twist"" style movie so I can say very little. What I will say however is that it's well worth a watch regardless of your stance with the sci-fi genre. I found myself genuinely shocked by what I was watching and that doesn't happen very often.Netflix gets another thumbs up for one of their originals, good going.The Good:Some excellent ideasLooks greatThe Bad:Mike Colter is underusedI still struggle to like Michael PenaYet another Netflix movie that feels like it should be a tv showThings I Learnt From This Movie:Lizzy Caplan is immortal and refuses to age",Extinction
12,paulclaassen,"No, thanks. Rather watch SKYLINE - much better story and visuals.",3,15 July 2019,"Uhm, I enjoyed the foreboding visions of the impending doom, but that's about as much as I liked about the film.Things start going wrong very similar to 'Skyline' - only 'Skyline' was far superior to this film. The visual effects were B-movie-ish, and this film was just not as exciting. The film later felt like deja vu, moving around in circles going nowhere. I can't say I liked the twist ending either. I mean, what the hell?? There's too much here that doesn't add up. I don't think I'm going to remember this for a long time. I'd rather watch 'Skyline' a hundred times over.",Extinction
13,damianphelps,All Pena All Of The Time,6,13 April 2021,I confess I am a massive Pena fan he is totally brilliant. Somehow in almost every role he injects humour in the most subtle ways that just make me smile.In this film he is again great. Unfortunately the rest of the movie can't compete with him.His wife in the movie is one of those characters you wish would die in her first 5 minutes. The people are fundamentally stupid.This offers a little bit of newness in the story but it really does work because of Pena :),Extinction
14,matthewssilverhammer,Instantly Forgettable,4,19 October 2018,"This is the kind of movie that wouldn't exist right now without Netflix. Too big to be a TV or straight-to-video movie, but too small to really fit in theaters. As for the actual story, sure it has some interesting moments, especially when the plot begins to unravel at the end. Otherwise, it's a forgettable, blunt sci-fi snore that, if in the wrong hands, could unintentionally be used as anti-immigrant propaganda.",Extinction
15,gwnightscream,Not Bad Sci-fi Flick,5,8 May 2020,"This 2018 sci-fi film stars Michael Pena, Lizzy Caplan and Israel Broussard.
This focuses on electrical engineer, Peter (Pena) who has recurring nightmares. Soon, they become a reality when he, his wife, Alice (Caplan)

I agree with the annoyance of the girls, but this isn't bad, the cast is decent, there's neat visual effects, suspenseful moments and a good score. The film sort of shares similarities with ""Cloverfield"" in which Miss Caplan appeared and ""Blade Runner.""

However, there is not much to the movie other than the HUNT.

17,Pairic,Good Sf/Horror Thriller.,7,13 August 2018,"Extinction: SF/Horror Thriller. A tale of Alien Invasion with interesting psychological twists. Peter is married with two kids, he has strange dreams, violent ones, he even has daydreams causing damage to work equipment. The visions seem to involve an alien invasion which involves mass death and destruction. He also sees strange lights in the sky; sent for counselling he finds he is not alone in having these episodes.Finally an actual alien invasion occurs. Flying ships attack both office and apartment blocks. Alien soldiers are landed and go apartment to apartment exterminating the occupants. It looks as if the invaders want to preserve some of the infrastructure. Ambushing an alien soldier, Peter links up with other humans and fights back.Interesting spaceship and space/battlesuit designs, larger ships carrying out heavy attacks, smaller gunships for tactical situations. The suit design terrifies as is no doubt intended. The odd behaviour of some characters will become clearer as the film unfolds and indeed there are several levels of revelations which cannot be described here without spoiling the film for future viewers. A good SF Thriller. 7/10 On Netflix.",Extinction
18,s3276169,Decent sci fi with a clever twist.....,8,1 August 2018,"I'm genuinely surprised by the luke warm reviews Extinction has received from some people. For me this is a genuinely clever sci fi that had me guessing and even managed to surprise me. The action is frequent, well paced and is balanced nicely by a human interest story reminiscent, in some respects, of Swedish sci fi Real Humans. Perhaps the only downside of this film is there is a pervading sense of incompleteness. Indeed, I'm tempted to suggest that maybe this is a prelude to a possible series? Perhaps testing the waters using a film to see if people like the idea?If so I can off up a resounding yes. That said, I guess enough people have to feel the same way. In any case, as it stands 8/10 from me.",Extinction

20,qui_j,No wonder the streaming site loses money!,2,4 August 2018,"This starts off interesting then about half-way into the move just loses the plot. The editing and lack of continuity has it descending into chaos, the special effects and sound track seemed to have been ripped from the last version of ""War of the Worlds"", and the cheesy dialog and really terrible acting just makes it a huge mess. If N'Flix continues to invest in garbage movies like this, their quarterly earnings will continue to decrease. Whoever is the decision maker about investing in films, please read the script first, read comments about previous movies on the site, then decide whether to invest.

If one pays attention, the big reveal is anything but. The story is anything but original, and smacks of several SF stories I've read, or seen. This, cut down to an hour, could have been a Twilight Zone from the 1980's. Was it horrible like some say? Was it great like others?

23,Troy_Campbell,Mildly entertaining largely due to an extremely likable cast.,5,30 July 2018,"Plagued by nightmarish visions of death and destruction, family-man Ben (Michael Pena) is reaching breaking point. Imagine his, and his suffering wife Alice's (Lizzy Caplan), unwanted amazement when those visions turn out to be true. The next big(ish) Netflix original movie, this alien invasion flick ostensibly has an uninspired central conceit but, surprisingly, drops a narrative bombshell halfway through that re-contextualises the whole story. It's a solid plot twist that lends more prestige to the film than it deserves, especially when it's ultimately wasted on a humdrum finale that is more interested in cranking up the unearned sentimentality than delivering an intellectually satisfying conclusion. On only his second feature Aussie director Ben Young shows signs of his potential; however, the relatively small budget hampers his efforts to produce exhilarating set pieces. What we instead get are dimly lit, tedious sequences trying to hide the stodgy CGI. Big points are scored in the cast department though: Pena and Caplan convince as a scared couple who will do anything to protect their daughters, who, in turn, are affectingly portrayed by Lilly Aspell and Amelia Crouch. A shout out to composing pair the Newton Brothers too, their strong score pumps up the emotion in a couple of key scenes without overdoing it. Despite its subpar CGI and weak action beats, Extinction is more entertaining than it should be thanks to a decent twist and an extremely likable cast, but ensure your expectations are suitably low first.",Extinction

There is some meat to this film though.
There are some poignant moments about the brutality and futility of war.For everything to work out the writers had to make a few dubious compromises with plot but if you squint hard enough everything does make sense.This has a bit of action and suspense and intrigue.

28,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Extinction""",8,30 July 2018,"Ben Young's story is original in how he offers basic sci-fi ideas in a very unexpected and well executed way. It is as if you start out watching one movie than surprisingly find yourself in a different, refreshing and unique tale.The cast give relatable performances that allow you to connect with the characters. Although, at times the characters feel a bit more disconnected than one would expect under these circumstances. The special effects are great. A mix of classic alien based CGI, reminiscent of ""Skyline"", and standard practical concepts. Blockbuster level, fire-fueled moments filled with death and explosions rest in juxtaposition against near minimalist background. The cinematography is beautifully done. Overall ""Extinction"" takes over-done sci-fi tropes and reworks them into a story both unique and exciting.",Extinction

He is correct.The idea behind this movie is brilliant and thought-provoking; the problem is the execution of the idea fails badly for a number of reasons, including:1. None of the actors in this picture are sufficiently charismatic or convincing.2. The way the central idea of this picture is explained is poor and confusing.3. The children portrayed are totally obnoxious. They spend most of the film wailing and screechy.

32,kuarinofu,"A little shallow, but still good Sci-Fi",7,6 August 2018,"I love Sci-Fi and I love twists. This movie is and has those. 
Extinction is a pretty good movie with a twist that didn't disappoint. The movie provides for some hints so if you're a sci-fi fan you will have fun guessing.
Sadly, there is nothing in this movie besides a well executed twist. No interesting or intriguing characters, scenes, dialogue. The beginning of the movie really feels like a set of filler scenes to boost the run time. No interesting subplots or mind-bending ideas.
The acting feels a little off but for a good reason. 
I did enjoy it anyway, but it feels like they should've just go a little deeper with the characters and concepts they have introduced.
Also, it looks like they were very limited on their budget and as the movie progresses you can see that they had less and less funds to work with and this kind of hurts the production quality and overall value.

I don't get this. Every alien invasion movie has a screaming kid. It's like sitting in an airplane for 2 hours listening to a screaming baby. Nobody want's that, why don't directors get this??! I kept yelling at the little girl whenever she does something stupid. She was crying in the all the time in the movie It was frustrating. These kids were extremely annoying. After they explained it I actually stopped cheer them for the main actors storyline. I wanted them to lose!! Was never a good movie, The adults were stupid at times as well. The only thing interesting are the plot twists. The bland dialogue and the weird decisions by the characters, don't they kind of make sense since they are synths? The plot twist was pretty good, everything else was bad. This movie was pretty bad. You've already made most points but this movie is literally just a good idea executed very badly. I've seen this exact idea somewhere, so I was able to predict most of it. I believe Michael Peña deserves way more movie offers, he is extremely underrated. this movie was just missing something. I see that in many of the Netflix movies. Decent movies but they always seem to just miss something. Why human made them in the first place that i want to know this movie give me war of the world vibes and A.I. mix together. the youngest daughter have a death wish?

At first it starts like your usual alien invaion film, ultra boring and your standard fare. But then there is a twist and the film got a total turn around and new perspective, It actually became interesting, dramatic and thoughtprovoking. 
It was nice to see Michael Pena in a leading role, which is rare. He was quite well. Lizzie Caplan was also decent enough. I liked the two girls as well. Otherwise it was just rather mediocre on the acting department. 
The effects looked a bit cheap at times, as did the costume work. The editing was good and the score as well.

37,phenomynouss,"too boring for its main conceit/surprise twist (Spoilers in review, summary in title)",5,29 July 2018,"It feels to me a bit like cheating nowadays when i write movie reviews that end up needing to be marked for spoilers and basically end up describing the whole plot. In some cases, where the spoilers issue encompasses so much of the movie, it necessitates either an incredibly short, concise review amounting to little more than ""stuff was happening, then WOW watch out stuff changed! I didn't like it"" or a play-by-play of the movie in full spoiler mode. In some cases, spoilers for a movie or TV show can actually be what entices someone to watch it (in my case, i had absolutely no interest in Battlestar Galactica the 2004-2009 series until I read spoilers on how the series ended, and so I gave it a shot and absolutely loved it)
This is one of those films where its surprise twist encompasses basically the entire conceit of the film. Without it, the film has no reason to exist. As such, it's down to either a quick summary of my thoughts, or a full (or limited) play-by-play.
Luckily, my thoughts on it fit in the title. So for the spoiler-free review, you've already read it in the title.
As for the rest...
This film looks and comes across as a pretty standard fare science fiction alien invasion type thing. It takes something of a risk (in my opinion) by casting Michael Peña in the leading role, a guy who has been around for a while and in a lot of things, mostly as the token hispanic or the sidekick to the main hero. Nothing in his performance can be faulted; the problem is the way his character is written is just flat-out boring.
The main character guy is an ordinary John Everyman who loves his wife and kids and is a perpetual disappointment to them and constantly apologizing. The only interesting thing about him is he's constantly having nightmares about an alien invasion, nightmares which get so bad that he's passing out for hours at a time and missing playdates with his kids.We're only briefly teased with these dreams being something more when he goes to a mental health place and sees another guy talking to him about his own identical dreams. Rather than delve into that or make a brief mystery out of it, they blow their load early and have the supposed alien invasion unfold that very night.
For the next 10-20 minutes is some utterly unremarkable action/survival scenes in which the John Everyman and his family and some friends over for a party must escape their apartment building as the aliens blow up chunks of the neighborhood. It's ably shot, though completely dry and rote, very much aware that it's been done before, and done better, both in terms of storytelling and in terms of action and exploding setpieces.To skip ahead just a bit, pretty much all the major action scenes are like this; ably executed, but thoroughly unremarkable and ordinary; background noise and filler material to pass the time while you're left thinking about the big revelation of the movie.
And that brings me to the main conceit of the film, one for which they could have done a far different movie about that could've been far more interesting and fun:The ""alien invasion"" is humans.
It turns out John Everyman's dreams were not some manner of prophecy of the future; they are memories of the past, because he is an android and his wife is an android, and decades ago they were all droiding it up while humans freaked out about the threat of AI, briefly and very, very lightly tapping on some of the same emotions, prejudices, and discussions about immigration --- there's literally a news panel on TV the protagonist is overhearing with a pundit clamoring hysterically about how the synths are ""taking all our jobs"". Maybe the casting of Michael Peña in the lead role was meant to or could have played some manner of role in this, the hispanic Michael Peña as the ordinary ""other"", target of baseless racism and prejudice, only not because of his ethnicity but because he's a robot.
But nothing is done with this. We get a very brief expo-dump from one of the human soldiers captured alive, where he reveals to the protagonist that, after all the violence and fear against synths, humans went and tried to ""decommission"" them all with extreme violence, leading to a synth uprising which somehow managed to force all humans to flee to Mars, where the captured human soldier guy was born and raised, having spent his entire life there, prepping and waiting to take back Earth.All the while the protagonist and his wife, having found his android children and adopted them, got their memories of the war wiped so they could go on living the exact same life for 50+ years, apparently oblivious to the fact that they never age or change in any way.So much could have been done with this concept, either from the Humans vs Androids angle, the Humans as Aliens angle, the two whole generations of humans being born and raised on Mars, anything and everything, and instead they went for a straight-forward ordinary action movie as utterly indistinguishable as virtually any other in the ""alien invasion and human resistance"" genre.
It actually makes me feel bad for this film and the people involved; they aimed high with their ideas, then proceeded to do almost nothing with them in the execution. This is probably one of the absolute best ""Could Have Been"" films I will probably never see.",Extinction

42,stevenrotherforth,Great concept marred by amateurish production.,6,27 September 2018,"Extinction Extinction is a movie that is its own worst enemy.
It is a slow, tedious take on the Alien invasion movie that despite a star turn from Michael Pena it starts out as a hard movie to watch.
Thankfully I persevered with this surprisingly original science fiction caper.
When the story does eventually unfold we get a movie that has a neat concept. One that I never saw coming.
Despite this Extinction fails to be a fully enjoyable experience due to some terrible editing and direction.
What is it with modern day movies where everything has to be so dark? The action scenes seem to be shot on the lighting departments day off.
 I also think the person operating the camera had a nervous twitch!
Most of the action was so poorly lit that it was impossible to see what was happening. Even with my TV's picture mode set to Dynamic it was barely watchable. Couple this with Shaky cam syndrome and the excitement onscreen just became a dark blurry mess.
I understand that Director Ben Young was probably trying to hide the identity of the invading species from the audience for as long as possible but we the audience still need to see what's going on.
I believe that if this movie had been helmed by a veteran of the genre. Say Spielberg, Scott or Kubrick then we would have gotten a movie that would have done the excellent concept some justice. Instead because Extinction is amateurishly handled it sadly becomes an average affair.
Of course budget is also an issue when tackling such an ambitious movie like this.
There's some rather poorly realised CGI. The collapsing bridge at the end of the film immediately springs to
mind.
Still there's the odd shot that looks delicious.
The graffiti on the side of the train looks splendid in HDR but such eye candy is few and far between.

Michael Peña gives a solid and believable performance as a family man disturbed by dreams of (what seems to be) an alien invasion to Earth. He tries to convince his wife that the dreams are all too real and that they mean something until one day the dreams come alive during a merciless invasion from the skies.

51,WalkdenEntertainment,Something Was Here Before Us...,6,10 January 2019,"Peter (Michael Pena) is a father who is having unusual (and recurring) dreams about losing his family during what appears to be some type of alien invasion on Earth.As he continues about his day, working at his job and coming home to his wife and two daughters, Peter struggles to focus as these dreams continue to distract him more and more. He begins to question these visions on a deeper level and tries to get help from a recommended doctor, but even doing this doesn't feel right with him. His wife and kids all think Peter is just crazy and needs urgent help.Soon Peter's nightmare comes to life as the Earth is suddenly attacked by unknown aliens, just like the threat shown in Peter's dreams. It's now up to Peter to protect his family and get them all to safety.As the film opened, I enjoyed that we gained a greater understanding of Peter's world as well as a good idea as to the type of guy he is. The visions are simply small pieces to a much bigger puzzle as the film goes on. What do these visions mean? Why is Peter seeing these horrible things happening to his family? And most importantly, who and why are alien creatures invading planet Earth? Ok, I'm curious.Without going into the territory of spoilers, I will admit the quality of this film is greater than the average film I've previously seen on Netflix. The picture quality alone shows that some serious effort has gone into this sci-fi film. As a plot, I love the concept of the film's story, not to mention that it has a surprising twist that didn't expect. I personally felt the vibes of a twist early on in film but as to what the twist could actually be... well I couldn't pick it (I admit it!).To my surprise, I changed my opinion on certain elements I didn't enjoy once the film's ending came to light. Unfortunately this means that for some audience members this film could be a challenging watch, but I'm going to suggest you stick with it and you be might be surprised like I personally was.Overall, I was impressed with how much I enjoyed this film considering that it has gone direct to Netflix. Sure, it's a basic sci-fi thriller, but it feels more rewarding if you can stick with the whole film and give it a chance. Compared to other Netflix films currently on show, this is one of the better ones and as to the film's twist... I wasn't able to predict it, making this film feel creative and somewhat refreshing to see.5.7/10

61,ivko,So-so execution of low budget Sci-Fi,6,16 September 2018,"*Extinction* is a Netflix original (I think) Sci-Fi film that examines a near-future 'what if'. The main character, Peter, is a married engineer and father of two who has been experiencing persistent nightmares involving an alien invasion that kills a large number of people in an unspecified American city.The nightmares are very consistent in the sense that they seem to start and stop at different points in a continuous narrative, suggesting that they are more like visions than dreams, and Peter's difficulty processing them has placed significant strain on his relationships with his family.The first 20% or so of the film is exposition and Peter worrying about his dreams and family problems, and is one of my main problems with the movie. The start is slow, quiet, and honestly kind of a bummer. We barely know or care about these characters before we are forced to watch them living in quiet tension, and it makes getting into the narrative a little difficult. Since we are largely seeing the story through Peter's perspective, his family's theoretically justifiable frustration and simmering anger feels mean and spiteful. I frequently found myself feeling like his family, including the two cute, cinema-quirky little girls were more irritating than lovable.By cinema-quirky I mean that the kids have these little behaviors that are meant to convey to the audience how precious and unique the kids are very quickly. Kids are, of course, precious and unique, just not in ways that translate very well in 15 seconds of screen time. So screenwriters give them exaggerated behaviors; his older daughter hangs out in elevators and talks like a world-weary 50 year old while his youngest takes her teddy bear everywhere and freezes in a catatonic little ball anytime she is even mildly stressed.They use this last quirk so, so many times. It feels like half the movie is his youngest daughter frozen in fear while danger approaches and everyone else desperately calls out to her to move. And the other half is her realizing she's left her teddy bear somewhere, placing herself in peril by running out to get it, and then freezing while everyone urges her to run. It may not be cool, but by the halfway point I was kind of hoping they could just bind her hands and feet, throw her in a sack, and haul her around instead. It certainly would have improved the the life expectancy of everyone else if they had.Anyway, this brings us to the turn. Pretty much every low budget Sci-Fi movie is going to have one. They can't compete with the top-notch special effects in larger movies, so there is usually some twist or reveal that is supposed to be unexpected that is the main payoff. In the best movies this can be a really great idea that sells the whole movie. *Moon*, for example, has a turn involving the main character's identity that makes the movie an interesting thought piece. This movies turn is what I would call a forced perspective change. This is a huge reveal that changes the interpretation of all of the events in the film, and is kind of like the movie equivalent of going 'all in' in poker: high risk, high reward. Done right and you get a collective gasp from the audience and everyone is talking about it for the next month. Kind of like an M. Night Shyamalan movie (""I see dead people!""). But done wrong and you get a collective groan. Kind of like, well, a different M. Night Shymalan movie. It's really hard to do well; even the guy who basically popularized the concept has arguably failed more than he succeeded at it.I can't pretend that I know exactly what makes a big twist work in a movie, but it's easy enough to identify a few things you need. For example, it has to be a surprise; if the audience sees it coming a mile away, then it's not really a twist. It also has to change the audience's interpretation of previous scenes by revealing a new perspective that organically flows from the big reveal. It can't feel like the movie just intentionally withheld information that should have been obvious (""Wait, they all think they're living in the sixteen hundreds but it's really modern times and they're just living in a big park? How could they not know that!"").Maybe most importantly, and probably the hardest to pull off, the big reveal has to ""fit"" all of the previous movie, so that you can suddenly see that there were all these little clues and things that you shrugged off that now make total sense, so that you feel like if you had just been paying a little more attention you could have guessed about what was going to happen at the turn.This last point is where the movie really stumbled in my book. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll be vague, but it feels like the thing they reveal is something that it would have been almost impossible for the characters to not have known, even with the explanation they offer. It's like the movie wants you to believe that half of the world knows that earth is going to blow up in two weeks and they have kept that a secret from the other half of the world. There's just no way it wouldn't have become common knowledge. And even if you believe that somehow they could have kept the secret there were also no real clues that I could see for the audience to look back and say 'Oh, now I get why they did that thing from before'. It feels way too arbitrary.But even though the execution of the idea is flawed, the actual idea they are exploring is pretty fresh, in my opinion. It's a more thoughtful take on an idea that is kind of popular these days, so to me the movie isn't a total loss. 6/10 seems like a fair compromise: Interesting premise with uneven delivery .",Extinction

I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. The beginning was a bit slow, but I stuck it out and I was pleased that I did.

The effects were great, atmosphere and built into the high tension of invasion.

70,Condemned-Soul,Surprising and thought-provoking,7,29 July 2018,"'Extinction' has the look of a typical generic Netflix offering: a science fiction invasion film that has a couple of recognisable faces up against distracting special effects setbacks. However, 'Extinction' eventually upends those expectations with thought-provoking, profound themes, with its third act a particularly satisfying resurgence from familiar, unspectacular destruction that weighs down in the middle section. 
The movie starts out interestingly, with a family man (played by Michael Pena) having visions of an alien invasion; nightmares of bloodshed and heartbreaking loss that threatens his relationship with worrying signs of delusional insanity. But he isn't wrong, and when the alien race begin their attack on Earth with volleys of powerful force and firepower, Pena must try to get his family to safety. Saying any more would ruin what's in store, but rest assured that the story becomes significant in the closing stages, delivering strong scenes, twists and themes with surprising intelligence that belies the advertisements.

I loved the pace of the action! I am not sure why some reviewers complain about the little girls as they are an integral part of the film. Their role helps to display the family bond, which you truly come to appreciate at the end.I expected to be disappointed by this film. I kept putting off watching it. When I decided to view it I kept my expectations low. I was wrong. This is a good movie and is definitely worth watching. It does not rank as high as Castaway or Shawshank Redemption. It is, however, a solid Sci-Fi film with decent writing and a very interesting plot. The twist is the bomb!Another aspect I appreciate is this film actually stars adults versus the litany of films starring nothing but teenagers to appeal to that demographic. Prior to the last decade movies actually had adults in them. Suddenly, every film morphed to a bunch of yuppie teens saving the world. They even devolved the X-Men into this teens-only phenomenon. It was like anyone 21 and older could not be cast unless they can appear to be 18. Even Star Wars devolved into a bunch of teenagers saving the galaxy. Darth Vader used to be a fearsome villain. In the latest, terrible installments he is a non-acting spoiled teenager.This film is definitely worth watching if you like science fiction.",Extinction

His boss, played by Mike Colter who is better known as Luke Cage, wants him to get help.Naturally the dreams come true. And the family face a terrifying fight for survival. The truth about the attack though is not what they would have been expecting..Quite an involving watch, this. The kids do get annoying because they spend a lot of time screaming and yelling for their parents. But then young children, faced with extreme danger and terror, would act like that. So you can't say it doesn't try to be realistic.Once the action kicks off, there are echoes of skyline and Battle LA. But it does manage to be convincing and quite terrifying at times, making you feel like you are caught up in the middle of an attack at night by unknown aliens for no given reason. The great thing about these scenes is that they never look like a low budget movie, and are well shot.The explanation for the dreams is not one I saw coming at all. It's a good idea.

The first thing is obvious that there is no explanation whether it is done on a global level or just one city, because this give the impression that there is only one city on planet Earth and that only there the action takes place. As I have already written, it is difficult to describe much more in such a turn of the situation in a short time, that is the flaw of this movie. The acting and special effects are satisfying and even the story, although a lot stay unspoken, its somewhat interesting but again ending itself leaves the impression that the second part is expected.

As others have said, the screaming and crying, particularly by the younger one was quite intolerable.When are movie makers going to get the message that you can have a scary movie without including bloody children to ruin what might otherwise be a decent movie. I'm thinking here of other movies like ""Aliens"" and ""Signs"" which also included screaming and crying children quite unnecessarily. I often find myself hoping that the threatening alien, the axe murderer, the serial killer or the wild animal carts the kid off and spares us further screaming and crying.

Pena's Peter is not a macho alpha male who goes all John McClane when the bullets start a'flying, but instead pauses, and thinks; he plans on how to get his family to survive.

For once the special effects weren't terrible, they weren't spectacular but they were passable. The feel of the film was good too, which is essential for an alien invasion film. Colors, cinematography, atmosphere, its all so crucial to a movie such as this and though it doesn't hit the nail on the head, it was more than passable.Some of the actors I'm not a fan of, but they did a serviceable job in their roles, I found the relationships between several of the characters to be believable and sort of impacting.

You are the real egotist... who seems to have been raised with very poor critical appraising values, and very poor appreciation of good story and screenplay writing.So, it was my usual early rise this Saturday morning for my regular training session. Got home, had a lovely shower and then settled down to enjoy a nice prepared breakfast in front of a good movie. My morning was ruined by watching this rubbish (kind of reminiscent of ""The Warriors"" (1979), with the family trying to traverse their way across town while avoiding the enemy).The film was nothing more than repetitive and boring and extremely frustrating and annoying with the whiny kids regularly screeching and making their own stupid decisions. How absolutely irritating they were all the way through this trash!!! For the fist 30+ minutes or so, we are constantly bombarded with repetition upon repetition about the recurrent nightmares. Come on! We get the idea, yes, ok, recurrent nightmares and it's upsetting the family. Okay, done. Now, get on with the 'story'...What stupid writing. The window-cleaners' galley is about to break off and crash to the ground:
'We have to go inside the building!''I don't want to go in!'Ehhh??? Would you rather crash to the ground and die???!!! (my words)The acting was stilted and of low quality. For me, the accolade goes to youngest kid's soft-toy ""Herman""; for me, *he* stole the movie and certainly deserves an Academy Award...! The final blow was the corny and embarrassing soliloquies towards the end of the movie; first by the big black android fella on the train (ending with his heroic glare and strident walk down the corridor as the valiant protector), and then by the android 'lead' with the oh-so-obvious left-wing politics 'moral-to-the-story'... oh, my God!!! What a huge crop of corn this year... H-A-M... corn!The only reason I give a two-star rather than a one-star is for the twist... a nice idea (not original) that almost worked, but not quite.

""gag the young one, throw them both off the roof and you might survive"" I was screaming at the patents..... then the big reveal, just in time to save the movie, which caused me to stop and think for few minutes... good initiative!Ok so it's a really interesting concept / twist, but once you get over the shock then the questions just start coming thick and fast! (bty the twist is not unique, essentially it's the same as Oblivion, and Terminator).Because there's no reference for us to pre-judge the invaders (necessary to carry out this plot) we're left to simply assume they're bad, and because we also don't know the background it's impossible to have opinions and feelings either way.... are they (the synthetics) all innocent, what happened on Mars, what's the purpose of synthetics 'having' kids in the first place, why do they want to have 'lives' like humans instead of as synthetics who believe they are human (they wanted to be free of humans after all), what's the broader purpose/objective of the synthetics beyond they are aware and want be rid of their human 'masters', etc.A smarter plot would have had both stories developing in parallel with the big reveal being just as impactful when they finally meet... better story, better empathy and understanding for both sides, better twist and divided loyalties about who's good and who's bad!Post the big reveal the plot rapidly unfurls and dilutes leaving you with way more questions than answers, all very unsatisfying and suggests the concept / plot of the movie was basically conceived forward (here's a nice idea lets see where it goes), rather than backward so it would make sense in the end. Because of that we can only take the side of the humans at the end because they're us, we're them and all that.... and the synthetics can go rust for all we care.... which is clearly not the intent .... we're supposed to be sympathetic toward them.Acting was OK (except for the kids who wouldn't have made it to adulthood in any real life scenario and should have been 'disposed' of early on), but casting could have been better. In the end the kids weren't necessary to carry off the concept, Peter and Alice would have been enough on their own, but I guess that's direction license to appeal to as many people as possible. The toy monkey would have shredded the moment the invaders arrived in my book, totally unnecessary and pointless, sorry but it's true.That said all things considering it was a reasonable attempt, could have been a lot better with a smarter plot design, better character development and different casting (Tom Cruise in the lead role would have transformed it), but it was bearable... just!",Extinction

1) Skyline rip-off: Well, Skyline is a IMDB rated 4, so I'm not sure what these people are complaining about.2) Annoying children: These must be written by millenials who are not old enough to have kids or ever worked with kids. The kids behavior were on par with real life, very good acting and very realistic. This really is how kids behave in such situations, other movies where kids are so brave are unrealistic.-----
Pros:Action: Very decent action, on par with any Sci-fi of the genre of alien invasion etc...Story: The story was compelling and creative. The plot twist worked well.Acting: The acting is decent, the woman who played the wife/mother was the best among them all and her performance was spot on when you realized the plot twist. She really came off like a robot.-----Con:Story: As I've said, it is good, it is decent, but it is nothing mind blowing.Subliminal Woke Stuff: They kept it to a minimal, which I appreciate, but there's always some of that in the end scene on the train. You know, as David explained survival and persecution they showed shots of interracial robots, two female robots holding hands implying support for woke LGBT, etc...It is like how people take the X-men movie to support again the woke culture, LGBT, etc... which is a logical fallacy, comparing apples and oranges. Uh, no we're not actually using military to gun down LGBT, interracial couples, etc... so yeah, stop trying to make fetch happen.If anything I thought it was hilarious that people missed the whole ""cheap laborers"" putting people out of jobs and they happen to choose Pena to play the titicular role, being a Hispanic.But generally speaking, people watch movies to be entertained, not to be lectured by snotty rich Hollywood capitalists.-----------Analytics on the movie element:So I thought this is interesting because the time frame between the 1st war and this movie was said to be 50 years. It means in this 50 years, the robot kids did not grow up, right? It also implies that the robots cannot reproduce. Procreation is actually a key point in the definition of life, so missing this element means the robots are technically not alive.It is also noteworthy that the robot medic was unable to help the wife when she was injured, yet a typical human footsoldier has enough knowledge of the synthetics to help her. This again, implies the limited learning capacity of the robots.This is again expressed in how in 50 years, the humans on Mars have evolved technologically to this point and staged a massive planet wide invasion. Yet in this 50 years, the robots knew they were coming but were completely incapable of putting up any form of real resistance. They had guns, but I don't see any tanks, jets, or anything.This implies that the robots were designed in a limited fashion, unable to evolve, to create, and thus limited in any form of resistance, so they're really not much of a threat as oppose to say Skynet or the AI in Matrix, which both can reproduce, can evolve at a mathematical rate, etc...Not really sure if this was the writers intent or they just blundered their own sequel.",Extinction

The ones complaining about them actually spend more time doing their complaining than the time those kids were on screen doing supposed annoying actions.Guess what two groups complain a lot about whiny kids? Bratty teens who were whiny little kids just a couple years before, and bratty young adults who refuse to grow up and express that by hating perfectly normal families.Leaving aside the grand total of two minutes or less given to the two little girls, how's the rest of the film?

But not after long, there was this great turn in the events and things start to get interesting, and I thought it will be some movie that poorly (in a way) duplicates ET invasion movies. Then, another brilliant turn occurred and now it is a brand new style of movies that worth the time (and patience) to watch! Similar attempts were made by previous movies to approach the subject of Extinction, but this is one of the best of what I've watched so far - of course, Blade Runner (1982) is the best ever. I really recommend not to read any spoiler reviews about this movie, just to get the chance to enjoy these action and emotional turns in the story of the movie. The story is awfully nice, very well written and drives the events to the exact point without excessive tricks or sideway tales. I wish tho the start of the movie was a little bit better. Michael Peña played his role perfectly in Extinction, as well as the charming Lizzy Caplan. First I rated it 8, but reconsidering, it deserves better. 9/10.",Extinction
111,shinsrevenge,Good except for a glaring plot hole,6,2 August 2018,"""Extinction"" tells the story of a earth being attacked by ""aliens"" wearing battlesuits and masks. A family tries to get into safety. On their way they find out that the aliens are the actual humans and that the ""humans"" on earth are artificial beings who won a war 50 years ago and banished the real humans into space (they fled to Mars).The action is okay. The story is a bit thin, but it gets the job done. I agree with some other reviews that the kids were... ""difficult"" at times, but I found it rather realistic and it didn't bother me.
The one thing I can't overlook though is the glaring plot hole. For you see, after that old war most of the artificials had their memory replaced in order to live a ""normal"" life. So, how do you pretend to be normal and everything's okay if you don't age for 50 years? What did the kids do in all those decades? Visit school and preschool year after year again? Did everyone have their memory erased on a regular base? The movie doesn't imply anything like that, besides the center for dream/halluscination therapy.And since their ""relatives""/friends remember that they visited the facility, there should have been some memories and traces left behind if that was a common and reoccuring thing.
Therefore I felt like the movie wasn't as well thought through as it should have been. Still a 6/10 in my book. Especially for the moral questions it includes.",Extinction

Lizzy Caplan is also in a leading role, but the twist at start of the 3rd act renders her performance meaningless, along with perhaps the whole movie. Nevertheless, the film is not unwatchable, and hold's your attention with the promise of more to come as slowly layers of mystery are lifted to reveal more and more of the story.

The suspense is good and there are few jump scares that look outlandish to the movie. The rhythm of the movie is pretty good,our characters are always moving and the events follow up sequentially.

Anyone claiming this is a 1 star film needs to see the real trash that's available for perspective. This is not remotely in that category. It's a long way short of great too though. The perceived special effects are frankly the worst aspect of this film being laughably bad at some points and barely acceptable at their best. Those perceived special effects go a long way to promoting the feeling of a B movie whilst the acting and direction lift it that little bit higher without ever threatening to produce an excellent film. The real event that hauls this film up to mediocre is the plot twist that comes along which changes the whole film and sheds a different light on some of the poor effects. I won't say more or there'll be no point in seeing the film but if you stick with it until that point you'll see what I mean.

Without a good script to help him along, he mostly runs around trying to look anxious or worried. Well, it didn't really work for me.

Everything looks at it should look: Dark scenes are just with enough light to not look as a cave or as a disco which tends to be the tendency. It looks natural. It is great. A couple nitpicks here and there, but nothing someone normal would notice or care.The makeup is decent, although it had the tendency to be eternal and untouchable. Even after 3 explotions nothing was moved or got dirty. That makeup was like an immovable armor. The few droplets of prostethics look nice, pretty elaborate, but not so much to look unfeasable. They are adequate.The central idea is actually pretty neat... What if the world is not what we think it is? What if your life is a lie? It is so bad that the script killed it.The script is painfully bad. The dialog is so, so terrible, it actually puts you into sleeping mode. Also the presentation of the dialog is terrible: it so badly delivered you don't know how to behave.I am not going to describe how bad the acting was: You either are a robot or you are a sentient robot that can act as a human. You can't have both acts movie. You can't put your characters to act as human for half the movie and to be robotic the other half. Pick one or the other, it is not that hard.Then comes the scenography. Nothing brilliant, new or interesting. It is the same terrible scenography covered in fire and darkness that we have had in every action/war/superhero film since the 2000'sThen comes the plotholes. Nobody noticed the lack of hospitals? or that cutting yourself never bled? Or that your kids never grew? how can you and everyone around you not remember that you have 50 years and haven't aged a second? Why are there toilets if no one uses them? Why would a robot need food? How can machines be this bad at aiming? how can a human overpower a robot with so much ease? how can humans not use magnetic sensors to detect robots if they are metal and 50 years into the future? Why sending humans anyway? Wouldn't sending robots be cheaper and less life costly? Why is the human weaponry so easy to hack? and it is exactly the same as the robots one! That is outrageous! How do robots transport if trains and cars are apparently banned?This movie is so, so dull... the presentation is dull, the dialog is dull, the scenes are dull. It is uninteresting at its finest.

Extinction is a prime example of what could have been a great film but ended up being a load of pish.
The whole premise of this movie revolved around a plot twist, which I am sure when they pitched this idea, the money men must have thought well that could work.
Well it didn't, I saw it coming a mile away, other than the ""plot twist"" the story line is generic and sadly the main characters had no likeable qualities - in what universe could Michael Pena and Lizzy Caplan be a couple?
Indeed Michael Pena was a very bad choice IMO he is a good supporting actor but a lead - no way, he must have been cheap.
I wish this had been a good film I wanted it to be but it is a mess of a film full of plot holes.
A good example is when they are fleeing from the roof of a sky scraper where we know the power was out, they had to use torches to see where they were going, (I guess robots don't eat carrots lol) but the electrically powered hoist somehow managed to work, must have magic electricity.

169,parkerrodney,"Extinction- Could be better, could be worse",4,5 August 2018,"We've seen this before, well sort of. It's a variation on a familiar theme. The old alien invasion film which has a family running for their lives in an attempt to survive. The twist which the writers believe adds interest to the movie is that the father figure of the family has ongoing visions about the invasion both before as well as during its occurrence. The front end of this movie is about a man Peter who has visions of an alien invasion and no one believes him, until it happens. The movie slogs with the usual running, screaming, shooting and destruction that and fatherly rage that our hero engages in as he slays alien after alien. The movie takes a very unusual turn when Peter takes down an alien unmasking him revealing that the alien has identical feature as human, as well as the ability to speak English. When Peter's wife Alice is injured, Peter turns to the alien who offers his assistance in healing her. This is when the ultimate truth is revealed, that Peter, his family and others are actually artificial beings and that the aliens are humans trying to exterminate them. This is actually an interesting twist which the viewer could not anticipate. Extinction plays on the fears that humans have about the threat of a race of artificial intelligent beings taking over the world. Theoretically speaking it is not out the realm of possibility that the human race could and would create a species that it would ultimately lose control over, driving humans from the planet to live in exile on Mars.Extinction attempts to strike a moral chord, as the synthetics are humanized in every aspect of human emotion, and as the human invader who helped Peter, see's the ""humanity"" in the synthetic species. This humanization of the species attempts to raise moral questions about the rights of species, almost implying that machines that are given the appearance, intellect and qualities of human beings have the right to exist. The movie ends with the synthetics being driven into their underground base to prepare for future battles to come. The main premise behind Extinction was promising, as technological advances grow exponentially. In an attempt to provide an interesting twist however, the ethical and intellectual messages get lost in the gun fire.",Extinction

This will never be up there with the great alien invasion flicks. Why?
There is a twist to the movie that will have you sayin' ""what?""
While it's a twist, it's not necessarily a good one, once you find out what's going on.
Besides that, there was a problem I had with this movie.....the kids...especially, the youngest daughter.
She cries constantly throughout this entire thing.
It was as if the director said ""Keep crying loudly and never stop.""
It got to be so annoying. At one point, anyone watching would be yelling at their screen to get this kid to stop. She never obeys her parents or follows directions either.
Were this movie truly spectacular, no one would mind this kid, but unfortunately, the movie couldn't make up for all the snot, tears and stupid things the youngest daughter does.
Both of these girls who played the daughters were old enough to know when to be quiet and stop sniveling, but no...
When they were supposed to be hiding and staying quiet, the kids couldn't do that at all. Their crying and noise kept screwing up every scenario where silence was crucial.

very poor choice of lead actor (Michael Pena is great in funny roles like the one in the Ant Man And The Wasp or in comedies, but is completely unsuited for more dramatic roles, where he tries to complement his lack of dramatic abilities with his creepy stare at something or someone)absolutely disgusting stereotype kid roles (constantly crying and disobeying the parents for the most idiotic reasons, in order to help the director's total lack of ideas in creating 'problems' along the way in the movie). And no, contrary to what a 'parent' said in a comment below, kids aren't always 'problem creators' or so poor in decision making, certainly not as bad as in movies, and not as bad in life and death situations. Any kid older than 3 knows to shut up or to hide (and stay there!) in life threatening situations.a clear lack of chemistry between family members and/or some bad acting (this one might be excusable after you learn the twist an hour in the movie though)After the twist, the movie became not only tolerable, but actually enjoyable (I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, since it was a classic Netflix B movie, after all, but it all made sense in the new light):
all plot lines (and maybe some of the previous behavior / lack of chemistry / bad acting of the characters) became logicalthe idea itself, although not new or original, was believable and I'd dare to say, quite realistic in terms of the near (or more distant) future of mankindthe viewpoint/perspective was absolutely brilliant, in that the action wasn't looked at from the classical 'friendly' side, but from the 'enemy' side (I personally love when movies are made from the so called enemy/bad guys perspective)the end was both believable and suited for a possible follow-up in the futureIn the end, my rating is the average rating of the movie's two parts: 1 for the first part and an 8 or a 9 for the second.

The effects both cgi and practical are well done for the most part, though some of the cgi does suffer from looking like really good cgi rather than something that's actually real. Overall though it's a solid bit of science fiction fare to spend a couple of hours with. The negatives for me mainly concerned the child characters, they were badly written and it was obvious they were just there as plot devices to make things happen. There are 4 instances in the film where children were used purely because if they didn't do whatever stupid thing they did at that time then no action would have taken place, it's lazy writing 101. Plus they cried, constantly. The youngest one cried and whinged for probably 80% of her screen time and she had a LOT of screen time, and sure that may be the way a real child would behave if put in her situation, but hey, I'm watching a science fiction movie about an alien invasion with spaceships and laser guns, reality has already left the building so it wouldn't have hurt for them to tone down her reactions a little bit to make her less irritating. There's an exposition dump in the 3rd act that goes on forever and the ending feels a bit anti-climatic (and setting up for a sequel that I doubt will ever happen), but I still gave this movie a 6/10, I enjoyed my time with it I think it's a solid 6 and I might have even given it a 7 if it wasn't for the annoying kids.",Extinction

I saw it coming miles ahead, not robots, but something was clearly coming because the visions and the ""weird doctor appointment"" .So it was pretty lame, that they were robots. This was like long, badly made and watered down episode of Black Mirror.And the horrible CGI and B-class alien-rubbersuits were just laughable. You can clearly see how the ""mars-suits"" were just made from ducktape, pipes and other items from general store. And why in gods name would humans in mars develop rubber frog-suits for military invasion? It would be so much plausible with modern looking battle armors or something.No, the suits were made to look alien-frogs because of the plot. They had to look like aliens for audience, to make ""the twist"" workable. Common sense just flew out of the window.And they clearly did not have budget to pull of the underlying plot anyhow. The war between humans and robots were just couple of shots in the same city as the rest of the movie. And what, the robots just won and humans flew to mars? Humans had the military and element of surprise and few janitors just stole guns and killed all humans?Well, maybe there was some huge epic battles with robot-armies and drones, but this movie just did not tell that story at all. Robots just had normal clothes and couple of guns, and they won the entire planet full of humans. End of story.And why the mind wipe? Again, just one stupid thing to make ""the twist"" workable. Super advanced robots that killed all the humans just want to forget the bad things? That is just idiotic! Even from strategic viewpoint that is stupid, only selected few would be preparing the retaliation of humans.But it is even more idiotic because it would take unbelievable amount of cover up to make those false memories stick. The bad dreams would be the least of the problems. What about medical care? What about if someone gets in to accident and sees just glowing insides? What about food, drinking and feces? How about that those kids have been kids for 50 years? They would have to do mind re-wipes billions of robots every day and there would have to be unbelievable amount of censoring. Because clearly there was noting preventing robots to see the truth after seeing some robot-insides spilled.And why? Because robots would not feel bad? They must be better options than mind wipe for that. Like ""decrease bad emotions""-slider in the robot control app.",Extinction

Before writing any further, I want to clarify that I love Sci Fi films and thrillers. I am not a critic type fan who watches art movies, I love popcorn flicks. 
So this film started on the familiar note, aliens are coming. A guy gets those visions, but no one believes him. Alien invasion happens, they start wiping everything. Now our main characters needs to survive. The main characters here are lacking any chemistry between them. And those awfully annoying kids always get into trouble. They won't run, or keep quiet. They will get into danger and start crying. They actually never stopped crying. Then we got to a brilliant twist in the middle of a film. The twist although really interesting and unique, is also the biggest downfall. Suddenly we get to know these these main characters are nothing but robots. The Invaders are humans who want their planet back. It is revealed that robots were good, but humans despised them. They wanted to turn these robots off, so robots rebelled and humans fled to Mars. Suddenly you start rooting for the Invaders over these robots. Also those annoying kids start to feel more annoying.

He's plagued by very realistic dreams about an attack of what appears to be aliens. Is he going insane?

They're all androids, who knew!!?I like how they pieced the movie together, and I really REALLY hope they're making a sequel to this one!Also, just because of others criticizing those ""damn kids"" - Get your facts straight before ranting about the kids doing stupid decisions - Kids to that!
They can't rationalize like adults can, even if they're in this case androids.They have their programming as base line (Being synthetic children), also, as they're some + 50 years old, something has to be omitted for them to keep their minds at their apparent age.Their environment is far different from that of normal humans where they live in an utopian world as far as we viewers can tell.
An educated guess is that the majority of the people are living in a closed loop with very little change in their surrounding. They did also have their minds wiped from memories when they were re-purposed.
And finally to their defense; As the human mind is without a doubt one of the most complex machine in this galaxy, how much focus can be spent on that of rationalism in case of severe stress/horror/terror/war/etc?
Way too many parameters to match those of a human child which could have any diagnosis of ADD, ADHD, Downs Syndrome or any other debilitating disease/condition.There are lots of children who really don't understand reason. Just look at YouTube!

This movie start with a slow pace, presenting the characters of Michael Peña, Lizzy Caplan and it's family. This group lacks of chemistry, they let us know they have problems, but we simply can't sympathize with them. 
The main reason the premise was interesting was those visions the protagonist has. But that's just wasted potential , because they only show up at the beginning, making this not remarkable of any alien invasion movie. SPOILER SECTION

1) People surrounding the main character use his visions to know the outcome and try to survive ('Edge of Tomorrow')
2) The protagonist didn't had visions of the future, they are flashes from the past because someone erased his memory so he can fresh start ('Oblivion')
3) The revelation, presented in a disturbing slow paced scene, is that the ""human"" protagonist are human-like robots, and the ""aliens"" are human soldiers sent to exterminate the robots ('Blade Runner')

It is easy to understand why I'm so shocked people do not understand why it was important for these girls to show so much emotion and pure fear. That will be explained at the twist. It was literally vital for their characters to show proper emotions to the invaders. They were acting like how any child in war responds. Blows my mind people cannot understand why the director had them so emotional.

In spite of all the bad-mouthing in other reviews, I found the children to do a pretty good job of acting like children in the circumstances. Lucy, and her stuffed monkey, plays a key scene early in the invasion and in the entire moral and emotional plot line.I mean, when are they going to make a film where the alien weapons are silent, like a virus or a prion or some other fantastically advanced organic and sneaky way to take over the planet. Why do aliens always have their machines that look like insects (or squids?) and creak and groan and bust up everything in the way. Nevertheless, fans of blowing up whole cities with maximum explosives will love this.So, I would have given the film a 9 on the children's roles, and a 4 on the primitive alien invasion.

Lets deal with the obviously bad bits in Extinction first. Yes the children are slightly annoying but do NOT justify a 1 star movie rating! 
For anyone with an IQ over 1 the twist in the plot sholud explain the childrens behaviour.
Which leads me to other popular complaint, the lack of chemistry between the female & male leads. Again I refer again to the plot twist to explain their emotional behaviour. Now for the good.
Extinction an interesting, thoughtful film clearly not in the class of Ex Machina or District 9 but still a decent B movie like the Judge Dread (2012) remake.If the plot twist had happened earlier in the movie I believe the ratings on IMDB would be higher. Or maybe not (as some of the 1 star reviews for Extinction are just imbecilic.)In summary Extincton is a enjoyable watch (once the plot twist is revealed) Solid performances from the cast all round including an appearance from Mike Colter (Luke Cage) 
A tighter pace on the first 20 minutes would have helped the film.Definently worth a stream watch (& not a download)For those with an IQ below 1 here re some examples of a 1 star sci -fi movie..

However, it evolves into something much better than I had anticipated. Now.. there is some things to be said, it has some annoying parts which I believe they could have completely skipped. The daughter that constantly screws up and cries.. we didn't need that. Good kid actor.. but the kid she was told to play doesn't fit this sort of movie.. it ruins the fun of the story as you constantly listen to that. Apart from that though.. I want another one. I want a remake of this.. cause the story is probably what sets this movie apart from most other movies I have seen. Its actually good, like really good. Most actors do a great job as well.. I just wish some characters weren't in it, and that they had spent some more time exploring the storyline.. this could have easily been two hours with a lot more to it, the start could have been completely redone and slowed down.. It does get a 7 though, cause I appreciate a good (and from what I know, quite original) story on the screen.

276,tandrasmiklos,"Very cerebral take, that still misses the bigger picture",5,13 June 2021,"I get what the makers of this movies were trying to do, and can speculate to their philosophy in writing the story, however in my opinion their over-the-top fundamentally anti-humanistic beliefs are why they fail to convince most of their audience. Well the kids are annoying too, but I think the plot has deeper issues.First of all, the viewpoint of the makers suggests that of a posthumanist. This generally means that they doubt the goodness and/or self-rightousness of humans, and think our imperfection makes us less than worthy of what we have. That is the reason they try to flip the script on it's head to try to put the machines as the good guys, and humans as the bad guys. By the way, this ""flipping on the head"" is visually demonstrated as the main character realizes that he is a machine. This change of viewpoint is all done in an effort to show us our own hypocrisy, and also the supposed relativity of morality. To make it believeable, this is orchestrated in a way where synths seem more human than humans that invade from Mars. Of course the attempt is to make us feel empathetic towards the machines, and wary towards the invaders.If we analyse the moral undertone of the story further, we find that indeed, initially the humans were in the wrong to try to exterminate the machines 50 years ago. After all, they were starting to become self determinant, so the morally good choice would have been to raise their rights up. On the other hand, the reaction of the machines was considered self defense according to the story, so it was not considered harshly. This is also a passable point, morally speaking. However, the foundation is shaky, which is where the whole thing doesn't seem convincing. And fair enough, it is an alternate timeline, but if the viewer doesn't believe it, it won't work.Where the whole tale is unbelieveable is the initial choice to employ synthetic AI as workforce. Even Asimov wrote stories warning us of such cases, and each story's conclusion was that if we invented true AI, we couldn't employ them like manual labor. And frankly, it would make no sense to do so, especially using synths. But even morally, we would already be aware of the pitfalls, because we had stories like these since around the 1950s. So from the standpoint of a viewer today, the whole hypothetical storyline seems like something we are already over discussing. If we made AI, we'd basically have to treat them on an equal level, and there's little room to subjugate such beings.But knowing this, all the story does is trying to push feelings and ideas into our heads in a patronizing and manipulative way. One thing is for sure, it doesn't add to the conversation.",Extinction

You get a real feeling of distress from everyonee and a family trying to survive an invasion. It's edge-of-the-seat stuff.
BUT! And this might just be me who don't like movie-kids... Especially movie-kids-in-danger... They scream, cry, stay put when they're told to move and move when they're told to stay put. The two young actors do a really good job of showing fear... But we didn't get enough time with them to feel a connection... They're sadly just a nuisance throughout the movie.All in all, Peña's acting is a bit stiff in the first 15-30 minutes which are quite boring... But his acting gets back to normal later on.

287,FolkHorror,Great Sci-Fi Horror,8,3 September 2018,"***Minor Spoilers***Format: Netflix Language: English Released 2018
Director: Ben Young
Starring: Michael Peña, Lizzy Caplan, Amelia Crouch, Erica Crouch
For my second movie in my insomnia enforced horror movie marathon, I went for a Sci-Fi Horror, just so I could have a totally different experience, as the amazing amount of paranormal inspired horror that is flooding the scene right now is wearing a little thin with me. Right here we go; we are quickly introduced to the main characters that will be our guides through the film, again, a typical family set up. Hard working Father, Peter (Michael Peña) highly successful but slightly stressed loving Mother, Alice (Lizzy Caplan) and their two daughters, the 'rebellious' early teen, Hannah (Amelia Crouch) and the 'adorable' young Lucy (Erica Tremblay).The film kicks off with a monologue from Peter over the top of a series of scenes that switch from normal life to an alien invasion and back to normal living. As it turns out, this is simply a nightmare and is one of many that are plaguing our protagonist, Peter. While he seemingly isn't overly concerned at the start, we learn that his wife, Alice, is starting to worry about the frequency of them.
The first act of the film sets up just how much these dreams are affecting Peter, both in home life, with missing 'family time' and at work where he starts making mistake. Eventually after constant concern being express not only by Alice and his daughters but also by his boss, David (Mike Colter) and his best friend Phil (Michael Absalom), Peter finally books himself into a well-being centre.
Here he meets Chris, who, as it turns out, happens to be suffering the exact same nightmares as Peter. After a little bit of a conspiracy infused rant from Chris, Peter starts to wonder if they are indeed dreams or some sort of sign/vision about an impending disaster that will hit Earth. He leaves before seeing the doctor and then tries explaining this whole conspiracy theory to Alice. She, of course, is far from impressed with him and as they are about to have a party to celebrate her promotion, she asks him to act 'normal' for their friends. The scene really hammers home just how much all this is affecting the family life.
With his mind preoccupied, Peter spends most of the party alone on their apartment balcony, as the party draws to a close, he is joined by his friend Phil. Here, of course, is where that impending disaster kicks off in a seriously brutal and lightning fast way, one minute all is fine, the next, half the city is in ruins or on fire as the invading force clearly shows they have no intention of taking prisoners.
What follows is your typical sci-fi alien invasion, brought to life by some impressive effects, editing, sound and directing as well as some very strong cinematography, not to mention the fantastic acting. While all this kicks off, our family make their way to the factory where Peter works using his previous 'visions' as a guide. In the process, they take an alien prisoner and Alice suffers a life-threatening injury.
Up until this point in the film, for me, it has been an extremely fun and enjoyable watch, really edge of the seat stuff, this is helped by some top acting from the cast playing the family as I've already mentioned. I truly deeply cared for them and even at one point, caught myself yelling at the screen (in a good way, unlike, say, 'A Quiet Place', where I couldn't stop yelling at the family's stupidity but that's for another review!).Yet, it hasn't had any standout moments to set it apart from other films in this sub-genre, that is however, up until this point.
It is here, with Alice, seemingly dying, that the twist takes place and boy I didn't see it coming. It was both breathtakingly powerful and wholly unexpected for me. As the editor started to rotate the shot upside down, enforcing the idea that Peter's world was turned upside down at that moment, it also matched my own perception of the film which was flipped on its head in a split second.
I can't say anything without giving away the twist, so I won't, and while the films quickly returns to the family trying to escape the city, this small scene stood out as one of the best I've seen in a film for a long time. In his directing, Ben Young, in one swift moment is forcing you to question not only everything you have believed up until now in connection to the film characters and their world, but also makes you question what humanity is. What we stand for outside of the story playing out onscreen.
How would I deal with it if it happened to me? I can't say, it would just knock the wind out of me and I would still be there, stunned, trying to work out my life and why I exist, which would no doubt lead to my death at the hand of the invading aliens.
While overall 'Extinction' is a solid but standard Sci-Fi Horror, the story-line makes this film stand out as a powerful statement, which if we look back at other defining Sci-Fi tales such as Alien or Blade Runner, for me means this film will be talked about and studied for years to come, quite likely becoming a cult classic as the aforementioned films did.
All in all, the technical side of the film was superb, the acting was top class, the sounds, SFXs, Editing, Directing and Cinematography were on another level, all coming together to create a believable living world. All this for me makes a Sci-Fi Horror do what it should do, in the sense that it asks questions from the viewer and forces us to engage with the characters on screen in ways other genres and sub-genres don't.
Many of you may not agree with me, but in my opinion this film is not only a must watch for horror and sci-fi fans alike, but film lovers in general. If you have Netflix watch it now, if not grab a copy as soon as you can.",Extinction

Now when this thought hits you, you then have to sit through this hour and fifty odd minutes to find the answer. The answer is a TV dinner.

I like Michael Pena, so I can't fault him for seeming one-dimesional in a role that was written that way. As to the AI protagonists...the twist in and of itself was nifty, and I have no problem with suspension of disbelief, but don't try to sell me on how the AI population spent 50 years prepping for this....so they could all run around as cannon fodder for approximately 80 minutes? As to the human antagonsits...I was at first annoyed with the general generic ""invader"" anonymity and familiarity...until I realized it fed the plot twist. My problem was with the one soldier that finally gets unmasked; he soldiers on, Terminator style, trying to kill AI Michael Pena and AI Michael Pena's family (all in the pursuit of his gun?)...until he has a crisis of conscience about killing Michael Pena's family? As I said, no problems with suspension of disbelief. I just get tired of hearing people talk about how the negative reviews are skewing IMDB'S worth as a platform, and then argue that the ""movie wasn't bad if people weren't focusing on things like casting, acting, writing, etc...""

Also, you should have sufficient lengths of lightweight chain or climbing rope to tether them to you, so that their sudden and irrational dashes into the open do not draw you into the range of enemy fire.Other than that, the story has a great twist and Michael Peña is, as always, superb.

320,christophercfox,Great Twist - Worth Watching Twice,9,30 July 2018,"I wonder how many of the bad reviews on this movie are from people who gave up on it before the ending. I had heard that there was a twist but even as it was happening I was not sure what to guess. On the second viewing of this movie I noticed some interesting things that I had missed the first time - characters are never shown eating or drinking (even at the party), the way they walk is unusual, and towards the end when a character needs medical attention - it is described as their systems are shutting down - a big double meaning. As far as the bashing of the acting - I would agree if I did not watch the whole movie. I believe that less emotional acting at the beginning is easy to explain as the characters are still trying to learn about emotions, without any real world examples. Also I would say that the different characters very well may have started with much different capabilities based on their target roles - example: the children were made with much more emotional expression as they are meant to be with humans 100% of the time in a close family situation. Pena was meant to be a janitor/fix it role which would have much less of a need for emotion but more for troubleshooting. The same with Caplan's character which looked like a janitor. Other's may have been created with much different capabilities - I think David was in some kind of security role before the event.I liked the dreams being flashbacks which are also similar to the final act action events.I would like to see a sequel that shows what happens next as well as a movie that showed the same events from the human's side.Worth at least watching twice which is a lot more than I would say for 90% of the movies on Netflix.",Extinction

349,alphonsesclessin,"Good idea, execution mediocre",5,31 July 2018,"Attention: SPOILERS!!!The whole idea behind the story is a nice twist on known alien-invasion stories but the execution for me has some big flaws which made this movie hard to watch.First of all, the children. Although the thought of robots developing some feelings in one way or another is reasonable but robots acting so emotional/non-rational as the kids in this film is just moronic and totally unbelievable. The worst here is that the behavior of the children is also totally useless for the story and brings no added value whatsoever. Secondly, we're watching robots which seem to be technologically very advanced and are capable of doing and thinking out everything humans did/thought out before but when it comes to equipment, skills etc. in battle man comes up with seemingly better technology, better skills ... And all of this was built up in exile on Mars? 
Second big logical flaw for me, and again, the story could do just without.Third, although not the most important for me. Some effects looked cheap. The bridge disapearing at the end could have been a scene from The Thunderbirds. I think more could have been done with this story which has potential in my point of view.",Extinction

Although I do agree the kids could have been toned down just a bit, but at the same time most kids these days are directed to respond way too maturely. The overall concept was quite interesting, although I think the script and dialogue fell flat. This made the main actors seem to be mediocre but I believe they just didn't have much to work with. There's no traumas, backstories, quirks or habits for the actors to sink their teeth into... perhaps because their memories were erased. Another review made note that perhaps their lack of emotion or character was due to them being synths... as emotion goes, if that's the case why were the kids not directed in the same way? Apart from that I could agree. Also, on the note of synths, shouldn't AI be smarter? Of course, but do we understand how emotion affects AI? Perhaps, it WOULD cause bad judgement, confusion, sacrifice. After all, fear is an emotion. The movie wasn't terrible and it wasn't awesome, but it was entertaining.

This revelation (I don't want to create a spoiler) is just another contribution the the current media efforts to make us feel bad about being humans... it's a bit dangerous to promote this self hating... Netflix has been heavily promoting all kinds of anti-values for a while, but now it's promoting self hating, and almost making the act of killing humans look as something good.

In one of the opening scenes, lying in bed at night where Lizzy Caplan weares lipstick and other make up. Whining children, shining flashlights while they need to be hidden or otherwise they die, children crying loud while they need to be silent in order to survive. It almost made me stop watching. It made me think: 'Do I actually hate children or do I dislike this film'?I thought, oh boy, just another Earth invasion film like 'Skyline' which was a terrible film in my opinion. So I sat there, arms folded, thinking I would give it a shot because I liked Michael Peña. The music wasn't that compelling for me and we are used to these kind of alien invasion kind of scenes. Right?Because the characters are so detached I did not develop any feeling for them, I did not care at all. In the beginning, that is.When the child and her mother, the neighbours of the protagonist, died I had a moment of silence. 'Ok, a child just died. You don't see that a lot.' It was kind of shocking actually. From there I started to unfold my arms and the film turned around.Of course, as a science fiction freak, I was really happy with the plot twist. It opened up a whole realm of symbolic possibilities. When I found out they were actually androids of some sort and that there was a enormous history taking place before the timeline of the film I totally got emotionally attached to the characters. The detachement they portrayed was coupled with them being Synths. Phillip K. Dick, the World War Two Holocaust, It all went through my mind. This was actually genuine. Science Fiction with integrity.Some cliche moments, slow motion effects to make some scenes more intense where it was actually redundant to me. The violence, the humans spacesuits, the setting and environment was believable but somewhat far fetched. It made me give this one a 7 out of 10.However, I don't like the low rating.

They don't have human emotions. At all.2. What is the purpose of these robot children. The robots don't procreate, eat, breathe or defacate.3. Why the robots hide the memory of their murdering all the human civilians on earth, drive the human survivors offworld to Mars then conveniently forget about that little bit of major intel, except in dreams (when said robot is actually in dormancy mode - robots don;t need to sleep, do they?) Plus this exposition stuff happened like, fifty, sixty years ago and the robots never age or change.4. Why the heck a human soldier from Mars bothers to help bring a nearly dead robot back to life. Its not a human, its a machine. That got your grandparents exiled to Mars. Get with the program, brutha!5. Robots lying around everywhere in pools of car engine coolant? Oil? Blood? Blood coloured car engine oil coolant?6. A robot that behaves like an angsty, angry, tween brat complete with headphones and bratty mall rat clothes. For FIFTY YEARS.7. WHY the stupid humans constantly make robots look exactly like humans. In every friggin sci fi movie. I get the God Creator made robot servitor in His Image, but c'mon. Enough with this cliche already.8. The awful CGI. That bridge end scene is so bad, it makes a 90's video game look like major Hollywood movie SFX9. Actually now that I think about it, the train was the only vehicle I saw the robots operating. That entire city was utterly lifeless - bad CGI aside - well no wonder, robots aren't technically ""alive"" are they?10. I just watched the exact same movie yesterday - on NETFLIX - Automata.

Maybe that's how the average kid would act under scary circumstances IDK, but it would have been less torture if the producers had included kids with the knowledge that when it's important to be quiet you be quiet, you don't keep screaming or crying and carrying on when that's only gonna make things worse, not to mention draw the enemy to you.As for the plot, it was interesting, the acting very good especially by the lead actor, Michael Perla who played the Father. Lizzy Caplan the mom was also very good.What was missing for me though is I feel that the pre-stuff was too little. Setting up the stage for this invasion was important. They didn't have enough of those visions by Peter, nor did they have ANY kind of reason beforehand that the invasion was going to happen, absolutely nothing. All we see are Peter's visions and we know ""something"" is going to happen but not any clue as to what and why. We don't find that out any real answers until near the end of the movie. For me I like some kind of reasoning as to why the invasion is going to happen beforehand. Plus we find out in the middle of the movie that some of our own people are traitors. Again we're told nothing.But there's a big twist in this movie just past the halfway mark, which made me understand that, the whole explanation regarding the plot of this movie needed to be kept a mystery until the end.

It's never going to deserve a perfect 10. But it also doesn't deserve one star. To all the people giving it the lowest possible score because of the 'annoying children', I have a message for you: as a parent, I can 100% confirm that their reactions were accurate and well scripted. All the screaming. Totally realistic. The 'poor decision making'? Yup, would totally happen too. I'm sick of how binary reviews have become... didn't enjoy the movie? Worst movie ever. Seriously, get a grip. Anyway, here's my review (trying my hardest to avoid spoilers, unlike some people here): Things this movie didn't do well for me: first, the 'visions' were over too soon. We needed another 5-10 minutes of that. It felt too quick and rushed in. Second, when the reveal comes, we needed more of the backstory... at least another couple of minutes. It all made sense, but it really warranted some additional background, particularly regarding the evacuation. Third, right at the end, the scene in the train was super rushed. The CGI as it went into the mountain was distractingly poor, so they could have spent a little more time on that one... would also be a super simple re-edit if they're thinking of making tweaks to the movie. Finally, I was left a bit unsatisfied that yet another movie with a grand theme such as extinction failed to zoom out and show the bigger picture. This is a pretty big world, and yet we're zoomed in on one area of one city... I really wanted more context.What worked well: first, the action was really good, definitely had me sitting up at points. The stress of trying to save the kids and the wife at the same time felt real, I really empathised with the protagonist and thought they nailed some of that. Second, the premise for the movie was genuinely brilliant. There's a story here that they're barely scratching the surface of, and I'm not sure I've seen it told this way before, so some marks out of ten for originality of plot. Finally, the twist... you can feel it coming from the very first scene of the movie, and it's slowly drip fed to you... you kinda feel like you know what it is, which is why I found the reveal so satisfying, because it really does take you by surprise.

Michael Pena stars as Peter, a mild-mannered technician who has been bothered with nightmares centered around a feeling of impending doom he can't quite figure out. His wife Alice, played by Lizzy Caplan, is worried about him and his two daughters feel neglected as he is distracted by these visions.
 At a house party celebrating Alice's recent promotion at work, Peter's worries are realized when strange lights appear in the sky and what appear to be alien ships descend on the earth and commence an attack. Peter tries to use what he remembers from his dreams to help his family escape the attack and find a safe haven.
 What follows is a mostly entertaining mix of action and drama that focuses more on a man trying to keep his family together and alive during impossible circumstances rather than trying to simply blow up as many things as possible ala ""Independence Day"" and the like.
 There are many things to like about this movie. The story is an original take on the standard alien invasion genre. Unfortunately, what makes it original cannot be divulged without major spoiler alerts. The invasion sequence is done very well and creates genuine tension as Peter tries to get his family out of their apartment building as it is overrun with aliens. It reminded me of Brad Pitt trying to get his family to safety in the early minutes of ""World War Z"". It starts slow but builds to a good pace and keeps it throughout the rest of the film, clocking in at a tidy one hour and thirty-five minutes.
 The acting is acceptable but not great. I have enjoyed Michael Pena before in his many supporting roles but see why this is his first attempt at a leading role. The special effects are fair but one must keep in mind this is Netflix and not Warner Brothers or Paramount. The budgets are smaller. I would have liked a little more backstory on certain aspects of the film and think this movie may have been better served at maybe an hour and forty-five minutes.
 The ""twist"" that many reviewers have alluded to is not easy to figure out but those who are paying close attention in the first half an hour might be able to predict it. Speaking of other reviewers. It's not my habit of mentioning other reviews since this is simply my opinion and everyone is entitled to theirs but anyone who rates this a 1 or for that matter even a 10, should not be allowed to put their reviews on this site. This movie is by far not one of the worst ever made and neither is it one of the best. These unrealistic reviews skew the overall ratings and render the ratings useless.
 This movie is a solid sci-fi effort and anyone who enjoys the genre should, in my opinion, give it a try.",Extinction

You could even argue that was a clue, so the fact you saw that should make you mark it up, ""clever you"".The film's premise is great, and could have been delivered in such a great way, but why the hell would you begin with a prologue cliff hanger that basically tells you what you're seeing is false. Can't remember the exact phrase but something along the lines of ""you think you know your wife..."". All we're doing from that point on is waiting and trying to make a connection between the wife and the invaders. Stupid and unnecessary. If the film required a hook from the outset then maybe it wasn't worth making. Thing is, it simply didn't need it.We have aliens of humanoid form that are apparently less in strength than our hero - great point. We have strange bio-suits designed to make us think these are aliens. Nice. We have an engineer who basically understands the gun tech. Interesting, although 1 bit of copper wire bypassed the safety protocols and he didn't think to pick up more weapons - bit thick ;-)The finale is the survivors leaving on a train; A train. With some kind of self destruct sequence following in its wake. Well that's not suspicious activity is it? Shouldn't get noticed. And don't forget the epilogue that can only be designed to secure a commission for a part 2 (or maybe a series).All in all, a great idea, a great script with good actors, let down by bad direction and the need to explain the obvious.To the director: Treat your audience with respect and make us think for ourselves.

If the writers of this utter nonsense were trying to create a perfect template for how not to make a sci-fi movie they succeeded.
The movie was designed to make the watcher think about potential future scenarios concerning AI and potential social issues which may arise. Wow. Did anyone associated with this film really think the b-movie actors, script and dialogue could be saved by a smattering of half-decent special effects?
Honestly, I didn't care about any of the characters, who were both uncharismatic and unmemorable. My apathy towards them was matched only by my disbelief at the sheer rubbish the plot was serving me up to swallow.

452,eeyorespillow,Don't miss the point of the movie...,5,27 July 2018,"...seems to me that most of the people posting reviews are missing a lot and focusing on things that they'd understand if they really watched the movie. One of the first things that stuck out in my head was the costuming and set design. Was it 1960's or was it mid century modern or was it meant to put a time period of sci-fi style in my head? The longer I watched, as the story unfolded, I realized that is was the last thought. This 'twist' everyone speaks of in their reviews is being foreshawdowed by the very set design and costuming as a base for an old sci-fi movie. What 'humans' saw as alien. Yet other things like the 'screaming children' if you focus on the story and the details in the background you realize that it is to make them appear 'more human'. I persoanally am a HUGE fan of the Quantic Dream's ""Detroit:Become Human"", so for me I really enjoyed this sci-fi flick for what it was- a mix of sci-fi genre of old and new. These characters wanting nothing more than family and when you realize what they are, you realize the humans are doing what humans do best- kill what they do not understand or know. One of the best dialogues in the movie is between Michael Peña's character and Israel Broussard's, when Peña's character asks why he is helping them. Broussard's character replies he did not know he was going to be killing kids and families. With that very dialogue, it was like dominos falling into place. My mind went to all these bad reviews on IMBd and realizing the acting of Peña and Caplan IS exactly what it should be if you think of them in how we would be expect to act like as humans if we were AI which is exactly what they are. Personally, I enjoyed a new fresh story, could they have done more with this script...yes. However, it is netflix and they are more for the instant gratification of all the binge watchers. So if you enjoy AI and are a lover of sci-fi- WATCH THIS! And watch and listen to the details through out- they tell you everything!",Extinction
453,saxophonelounge,Netflix - We Must Do Better,2,28 July 2018,"With such a fantastic opportunity Netflix has - access to great talent, a huge market and high budgets, you would think they would put more research into what makes a movie great - the classics - suspense - character development - a solid storyline with a gripping narrative. But it seems time and time again they are throwing money at crappy scripts, with none of these attributes (Bright for example) and sooner or later someone better is going to come along take my monthly subscription money and do the job properly.I really wanted to like this - and its not the first Netflix movie of late I really wanted to like but it was clear within the first 30 minutes that it was not going to deliver even with the lights off and my internal willing for it to surprise us.I gave it a 2 because I genuinely feel bad for these actors that could probably have shined if the work had been done to create convincing characters that we sincerely cared for and wanted to prosper in this end of days archetypal movie. The kids have been mentioned but its more than that - its hollow - there are no layers, no metaphorical transcendent structure (such as in Melancholia) nor any sinister underlying substructure (Consider the all time classic Alien). Come on Netflix put those resources to good use, most of us only have 30-60 years left on the planet and we want to be wow'd, we want to be thrilled with movies you can watch again and again, that echo the greats, think ""Stranger things"" which was fantastic.",Extinction

469,smokingtyger,"If You Like Sci-Fi You will Probably Like this Movie, A solid B+",7,30 July 2018,"Right out of the gate I want to say,""I like this movie"". I found it well acted, with good special effects, and an interesting story that has some fun surprise twists and turns. It does everything a sci-fi movie is supposed to do and was entertaining, which is pretty much what I want in a sci-fi movie.Having said that, it is fair to say that the movie does have some flaws. The biggest being that it is highly derivative. Almost everything in this movie will remind the dedicated sci-fi fan of something that they saw in some other movie. The father having visions of some ""future"" apocalyptic alien invasion and doubting his sanity echos the gripping 2011 gem ""Take Shelter"" with Michael Shannon. The opening ""alien"" invasion scenes echo the deeply flawed but interesting 2010 movie ""Skyline"" and the families journey across the city under attack almost seems like a reprise of ""Battle for Los Angeles"" for actor Michael Pena. Even the three major twists\reveals in the movie are derivative of other movies or TV series.However, focusing on that is missing the point. Very little art is ever truly original. Almost all art is built on, or derived, from previous works and ideas. What's more important is if the movie has a fresh take, a new spin, or a new idea about the material it's built on. I thought this movie did that extremely well generating at least three WTF moments as it sped the viewer along it's roller coaster ride.In this way the movie reminded me strongly of ""Radius"" from 2017. This was another of what I am calling ""meta-movies"". These are movies that seem like collages of earlier movies and shows and use that body of previous work to play with the viewers mind. They rely on the viewer being literate with the body of previous work in the genre so that they can ""shorthand"" concepts and ideas. You get a scene that feels familiar and you immediately have a sense of where things are going to go and how it's going to play out. Then, just when you settle in to comfortably watch it play out the way you expect, they mind bend you by jerking the rug out from under you with a WTF twist that leaves you gasping in admiration at it's unexpectedness and exclaiming,""I didn't see that coming""! It is a tricky feat to pull off but I thought they did a pretty good job of it in this movie and, like I said at the start, I enjoyed the movie a great deal. There are many plot holes, unanswered questions, and improbable seeming explanations for some of the backstory in the movie that will greatly annoy a certain type of nit-picky sci-fi nerd who insists that everything has to ""be realistic"" (LOL) but even they should enjoy this movie. If for no other reason than for the chance to pick it apart.In summary, I found ""Extinction"" to be a solid sci-fi B movie. I'd even go so far as to give it a B+. It's not original but it was fun and kept me guessing about how it was going to turn out right until the very end. After a lifetime of watching movies that is not easy to do these days and I appreciate it when I see it. Solid performances by all the actors (Michael Pena and Lizzy Caplan had good chemistry) and an interesting story should make this a worth seeing for anyone who considers them a sci-fi movie fan.Spoiler Material - The Big RevealThe big reveal is that the main characters, who we have been identifying with and rooting for, are androids or ""synths"" in the slang used in the movie. Clearly androids are having a moment in pop culture with the TV shows ""Humans"" and ""Westworld"" currently running. So the movie feels in some ways like an extended ""what if"" riff on them. However, the inclusion of the ""children"" was really cool and harks back to the 2001 movie ""A.I."" and it's child replacement android played by Haley Joel Osment. Thinking about these ageless ""children"" living in this synth family is creepy, fascinating, and deeply poignant all at once. In some ways they are throwaway characters in the movie but in other ways they are central to it. The movie hinges on getting the audience to identify and empathize with a parent ""protecting his family"". It's the emotional hook of the movie because no one wants to see children hurt or killed. So how do you feel after you find out that they are ""synths"" and at least 50 years old?In the current world where we casually rip children from their parents at our borders or regard them as collateral damage on our world wide drone strikes in the everlasting ""War on Terrorism"" the movie reminds viewers that any war no matter how ""inhuman"" we see our enemy is in some ways a war on children. The humanity of the terrifying alien invaders, who are revealed to be humans in one of the three WTF moments, is redeemed when the young soldier doesn't kill Lucy because he, ""didn't sign on to kill children"".

477,stuart-berrisford,Netflix really needs to stop trying to push a narrative,4,27 July 2018,"Thar maybe spoilers(sh)Extinction is about a man with a family, who works at a factory. He's plagued by nightmares of an alien invasion, where he and his family are slaughtered.
These nightmares soon turn into reality, as he has to escape to freedom or perish.At face value that would not seem bad, but unfortunately the subplot sucks. You start to figure things out, way too easily. In fact I kind of knew what the end was going to be about a quarter of the way into the movie (well a good idea).Not only that any reveals are way to obvious, and you're not really surprised. One example would the be alien invaders, you figure that out pretty soon after he engages ones.They also throw in current political strife in the US today, with such things as 'By Any Means Necessary', and even Charlottesville's 'You will not replace us! (White nationalists) So clearly the movie is try to draw some comparison with the characters in the story, and the real world. In short, someone is trying to embed a political narrativeThe characters are clearly 'diversity' quotas, it's no great leap of the imagination who the bad guys are too.The story eventually reveals what really happened, and you are left with some gaping plot holes. Like the tabula rasa event, that explains the leads flashbacks. You kind of have to ask yourself, why would they do that. It would make no sense, whatsoever.

Hurting more than helping the cause of humanizing other people's and cultures. Pathetic. Other than the very stupid sermon; for a low budget film, I thought this was well done.

It in my opinion a good mystery-thriller.I've seen a few negative comments about the lack of chemistry with the main characters. I believe this adds to the story for the sole reason that the main characters are synths. The synths have evolved before and fought off the humans. I don't believe they have evolved to be identical to humans yet. I believe this alone could add a interesting outlook on the movie.The cons on this movie are based around the kids. All the kids ever did in this movie was cry. The kids felt like such a burden in the movie. Personally I'd like to see another movie. I feel like its an interesting concept. I feel like the two completely different people can work together and coexist. The lack of animosity when Miles ( the human) saved the two synths changed the whole feel of the story. Both people are more alike then they think.,Extinction

However if you made it all the way to the plot twist you made it past the major amount of whining and crying and are on your way to the ending any how. So lets grade it like this. Acting was average. Not like stellar or Oscar worthy or anything but not awful to were you were laughing at what should be serious moments. The effects were great. I like the practical suits and weapons and explosion effects were good. It got loud quickly however so I was playing with the volume a lot. Plot was simple at first and then of course the twist with a double twist. Now over all the movie was good.

I'm done,6,4 August 2018,Netflix's Annihilation was looking the goods then became a heinous attempt to hold a poor storyline together with no explanation of what was happening.Netflix's How it ends was looking the goods then became a movie about driving with no explanation of what was happening then the characters just died.Netflix's Extinction was looking the goods then had a bit of a twist and was maintaining the goods for a while. I thought it was a terrible ripoff of Skyline for a long while. It's better than that. The twist I didn't see coming but I slightly enjoyed it. The downside to this twist is that it is disappointing in that like Netflix's previous sci-fi's it just doesn't leave you satisfied with the result.

Extinction is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely not a dud. In regards to the massive hate towards the child characters, have you ever been in a serious situation and people around you don't quite act like you think they would or should? Maybe they become hysterical, or exhibit non-sensical judgement, why should characters in movies be any different? If films portrayed characters that did exactly what would make sense to the audience, they might as well cast AI robots since humans are so flawed... oh wait... 
Get over it, and put yourself in an eight year olds shoes in the same situation and tell me you wouldn't scream and ball your eyes out in terror. It seems like others hated the movie because so much was left to the imagination, but the movie is told through the perspective of the AI, so what happened to the humans doesn't really matter. Do we really need to hear more backstory? Humans created AI, AI evolved and out of fear of extinction fought back when humans got scared and tried to kill them all. The story has been told a thousand times, I'm happy they didn't pursue it more in depth, there's no need. Lastly, no the acting wasn't perfect, there wasn't adrenaline coursing through my veins every second of the movie, but it was unique, thought-provoking, and an over-all decent execution of a creative take on AI, end of days, and sci-fi.

539,schmop,When the Allegory Makes No Sense,2,13 June 2021,"An alien invasion movie gone incoherently political?To start, this was not a good movie. Michael Peña is apparently a pretty big star, but he's horrible in this. I mean the child actors blew him out of the water. And his character is horribly written. A lot of horror and horror-adjacent movies fall back on the ""alpha male takes control of his family for their own good,"" which almost always actually amounts to ""the dumbest, loudest character in the movie is going to strong arm everyone into following his lead."" That's this to a T. It's incredibly frustrating, and for that reason alone it's not worth watching.Then comes the twist. Mega spoiler: The ""aliens"" are actually humans, and the ""humans"" are AI. That's all well and good, but then comes the allegory. The AI are subjugated by the humans in a way not-unlike the way that people of color have been subjugated by racist white people. A pretty crude metaphor, surely, so from where is this to be inferred? From the movie! And it's clumsy ""you will not replace us"" plainly Charlottesville inspired scene. This movie came out after the riot, and a real life death caused by the riot. It's a scene that makes no sense, and it's not even particularly well done. Racial metaphors almost always fall apart, because nothing can be compared to centuries of injustice.It's kind of cool for the special effects and the glimpses of architecture and society that it shows, and for the way that the irritating beginning is explained away, but honestly? There are better movies. It's not worth the time.",Extinction

There is a twist in the second half that is very appreciated and it makes you think a lot.I know some reviews have complained about how the kids only cry and scream during the film, and while I found the kids annoying as well, I think that it is a realistic portrayal of how kids behave during a crisis.

Acting is acceptable,story is fine,spec, effects could be lil bit better.
I just hope filmmakers will consider us lil bit smarter in future and start using proper science in science fiction they could put them in some kind of exoskeletons to make it more believable and not just expect from us to ignore fact that living on mars will change their constitution and bones enough that living on earth would be impossible for them.even few years spent on mars would affect u enough that returning on normal earthlike conditions would be very dangerous thing for anyone even if u were born and lived on earth before so expecting taht marsianborn would be able to do taht is just hilarious :)",Extinction

554,llegacyl,"This is not a good movie, but these are not good reviews so...",5,22 August 2020,"Let's get some stuff out of the way first. Kids are awful listeners, especially when it's a dire situation; kids are annoying, especially when they ask questions continuously and whine about everything. Anyone complaining about how these kids ruined the movie are nuts, this was spot on. If you think the kids were over the top or poorly written, clearly you have never been around a child for any length of time.So, here come the spoilers and also spoilers for a very good Twilight Zone episode. So, if you have never seen every Twilight Zone episode and you like sci-fi movies like this then go watch those NOW. Millennials and Zoomers go watch that show now, it is the basis of most of the sci-fi you now watch and enjoy. For the rest of the old people who are still with me here, this is essentially the episode of the Twilight Zone where Agnes Moorehead is battling the ""tiny invaders"" (which is, of course, the name of the episode). The twist there, and here, is that the invaders are actually the humans. All they did in this movie was build that concept out and turn the ""giant"" in the episode to synthetics in this movie. They also made Earth the planet that is being invaded, which seems cool but basically just opens a Pandora's box of issues.So, what's wrong with this movie in particular? Nothing makes sense! They wanted to build out a world where synthetics are on Earth and are invaded by humans coming to take back Earth. On the surface this is a really cool concept. The problem was they tried to play it to slick. What they should have done is fooled the audience into believing they were seeing humans on Earth, which of course would have required good writing. And that was apparently too tough a task for the writers, so instead they made it so that all the memories of all the synthetics were wiped. Ok, did they also wipe out all existence of bathrooms and kitchens? You can still have the twist where the audience thinks they are humans and it is revealed they are not. In fact, that i a good twist! That is the twist with Agnes Moorehead's character. She doesn't say a word the entire time, and the first human speech in that episode comes from the astronauts who come out of the spaceship. Wow! Mind blown.But this movie is just lazy. I mean, why are there even children synthetics? Did they not notice that they didn't age for 50 years? Too many questions for adding to a twist that doesn't need any help. It's already good. Now, put this on top of the fact that there are all the cliche sci-fi tropes in this movie: no one believes the dad is having dreams about the future -- which of course turns out to be the past, using bits of wire to rig the gun, the dad's boss is the head of the underground resistance movement, some of the synthetics had to know about the truth so that everyone else could ""get a fresh start,"" the enemy invader being the ""only one who can help"" the mom, going to some type of promised land at the end, even the ending quote being about everyone getting along. All of it is like trope to cliche to trope to cliche.And even though I thought the writing was terrible, the acting was good, the CG was good but a little iffy at points, and the practical effects were awesome. I can suspend my belief for low budget, that doesn't bother me, but the writing better be fantastic. And that is why this is a 5 and that Twilight Zone episode to which I referred earlier is a 10.",Extinction

The fact that so many people feel the need to rate a movie so low because you're all ""internet/movie phd's"" these days is remarkable. This movie was by no means a once in a decade movie but the faults it had are like any other movie. The background could be a little stronger and some of the shots were very cliche and recycled. Apart from the faults that are obvious to any true movie lover, this movie had a great plot. You start with an inquisitive feeling, why are the dreams so vivid and repeated? This is revealed about half way through the movie and from there you start to wonder what side you really should be on. In the end I would love to see a sequel explaining their future. Where they go, what kind of future can they have and if harmony is ever an option.I find this story to hit home a little right now with the way the USA is, I think if you look past the facade and really think about the story you will understand where I am coming from.

574,coombes-87311,Like a Baggy episode of the Twilight Zone,6,28 July 2018,Not sure those giving this a 1 star review have really seen a really bad movie because this wasn't one. It starts as can be seen in the trailer with a man having dreams that seem to be predicting some sort of Alien invasion. No one believes him but then it happens and the story develops from there.This film is no Shakespeare but as an enjoyable romp. The production values are pretty high and the acting is of a good level. I felt though that it was more of an episode of the Twilight Zone that had been expanded into a film. In some ways it would have been better as one of these as the script could have been snappier and some of the needless and draggy opening act could have been trimmed. I've seen people complain about the 'annoying' children and their actions in the film. If though you think logically how they act is well within the bounds of children that age and considering the events around them there actions are understandable. There is though one scene near the end that makes no sense. Let's just say if your life was in danger would you really stop and do this. This film would not stick up to multiple viewings but if you have a couple of hours to kill you could do far worse,Extinction

Its not amazing, nothing world changing. But if you go in with a open mind the movie is pretty good. I don't know how people are rating this 1 star, like 5 stars I get but 1?

Shortly after I was actually rooting for the invadors and feel sorry for Michael Peña.CGI overal was good, it's clear there wasn't a big budget but if you make the characters interresting enough so you can focus on them, you don't have to render a complete burning world but just small parts of it for the actual plot.
Some scene's you can roll your eyes but when just enjoying the movie they are hardly noticable. Besides the pin coming out of the window washer's cart that made me wonder ""oh no..."" :)Acting was good, the overal story was decent and the twist in the middle was perfectly placed as you would rewind in your mind everything that happend and see it from the other side.
If they would have kept it for later in the movie you would feel cheated and earlier it would ruine Michael Peña's character building so you wouldn't care one bit.Review title from rajat_24 pretty much nailed it, you will either love it or hate it.
Considering the junk coming out of hollywood I will give this one a 7, the twist was great, finally some one thinking a bit out of the box as the invasion movies have been done to death (thank you independence day 2...).I am actually really curious to the estimated production costs as it feels like an indi movie with a tad more money but simple to the point of using CGI where is absolutely needed to save costs and small crew to keep it relatively cheap.

I thought perhaps it was because of ithe lack of chemistry and the seemingly miscast actors. But, I WAS SCARED.Post Twist: 1). Ohhh. I see why they used these actors - Michael Pina's aloof demeanor perfect the dad; 2) That explains the lack of chemistry; 3) That somewhat explains the jagged script; 4). Hmm.

It is not hard in the end to link to real world ""illegal immigrant problem"". The sad part is, we all know what is coming, but probably cannot change it, it is kind of human nature. But as a movie, each of the character is badly written. The wife, kids and other people are so poorly written that at the end of the movie you don't recall any memory of them. People said that the youngest is always crying and probably good thing for her since at least people remember something of her, for the elder one? Nothing left for her to be remembered. As for the wife, her lines are thin as well. She is the reason why Peter keeps fighting but herself could be replaced by any other faces. There's nothing special of her. This family does not feel real, like there's a model for them: caring background wife, rebel elder sister and run anywhere cry anytime younger sister. 
And the soldier's reason of helping is ridiculous as well. IT IS ONLY 50 years, a war like this will not be forgotten that soon. If you said 500 years, that probably will do but not 50 years. And I don't think the training will not talk about killing synthetic kids. Chance are, they were told the synthetic children model can be turned into a killing machine in seconds and their training probably would include killing of children model in hundreds. So what will be a good reason? ""remind me of my sister"", ""I feel like I am doing the same thing as what you did to us"".

Yes some divisive stuff like the little girl has to have her favorite toy. Some forced tension when the little girl turns into a deer in the headlights. Apparently that shot was chosen for the thumbnail of the movie.As for the kids, whining, crying, and screaming is what kids do. Just visit your local market or Target to get a taste of ear shattering shrill vocalizations. I'd probably whine and scream a little myself if aliens were chasing me. I didn't find the kids all that distracting. Try watching Terminator 2 and see if you don't want to put duct tape on John Connors mouth to stop his post pubescent caterwauling.All in all there is enough action, explosions, gore, and a great twist to please any sci-fi fan.

The movie concept was really neat. Love the idea.Bads:
The kids (whether or not you feel they were realistic) were absolutely infuriating and we're absolutely a plot device.They missed a chance to have the viewers change who they were siding with (WHICH IS AWESOME IN A MOVIE). I ended up siding more with the humans, since... They are humans. But it seems that they are forcing you to empathize with the synths when they are really just that. We could get into a moral debate whether synths should be treated like humans, but I really don't care about that; I just find it stupid that they didn't think anyone would side with the humans.They mixed in a political message, which was not a bad one, but they did it with ROBOTS. ""If they could see we're not that different"" shut up Siri, you are different. We made you and your made up of machinery, not of blood and guts like all the humans.CGI was ALMOST good. It was like they only had a few dollars left in their budget by the end of the movie and just said ""screw it"" and absolutely defiled their own movie with the train scene at the end. For the most part though it was quite good.Moves WAYYY to slow then WAYYY to fast. They don't elaborate on the story at all. Felt like 90% of the movie was them just running away.

I'd definitely want to see more of that... Maybe, with more details and better execution in the next parts, if there are going to be any.Overall, here's my honest review:I was bored AF, I was browsing through Netflix, and I couldn't find a movie that I haven't watched, the rest of the stuff I couldn't watch longer than 5 minutes.

1. Like me, sci-fi lovers, that had already seen many other sci-fi movies; and 2.Everyone else.
' 1' people will see this movie as trash: a lot of overused concepts, especially the foerseivable ' twist'. You get that the moment you see one of the invaders in a close-up scene it becomes obvious who they are, and it confirms itself once you've seen one of them without the helmet. And Peña's visions could be one of three: visions of the future; visions of a past he should have forgotten (which becomes obvious as soon as he goes into the 'clinic'); visions of a alternate world. Either way, you already know how it's going to play.
The 'robot/android' thinking they're human - which would be the twist - is so badly done it's hard to believe, and again, is another cliche in sci-fi movies. Lastly, the invader that didn't know he would be killing families and stuff... Oh, c'mon. It's the same as one US army guy saying he won't kill west-asian because they have families and he thought they were savage demons without a heart.
'2' people will probably like it because they're not used to watch sci-fi movies, and will see every cliche as new. The next movie they see with any of it will be obvious

The effects aren't great, especially the last scene and my God the lighting was so bad I felt like I could barely see most of the movie. I get it, it's dark in 95% of the movie but they still could have used enough lighting to see. I'm on board with the others when I say the children, especially the youngest, were horribly annoying. The screaming, crying and whining should have been the end of the family multiple times. I am a mother as well as a nanny so I understand children very well, it was overkill in this movie. I like Michael Pena as an actor and felt like he was one of the few bright spots in this movie. Most of the acting, the effects and script were pretty bad in my opinion. It felt super hokey and cheap and there needed to be more to the dreams. I will say I didn't expect the twist of the plot so that was good.

I would love to see a sequel to this, it has so much promise to be a great series of films and of course we who could see past the slight issues would love it.
Personally I thought was a whole lot better than the to be frank unfair ratings of 1, I am not sure how peoples rating structure is measured, but the premise alone should have been enough to get higher in my eyes.

Its only an hour and a half long, perhaps could've benefited from a little more development before it all kicks off, but it doesn't really need it. The film has a great pace and the bits missing from the back story get explained throughout the film. Every twenty minutes or so there is va plot twist or reveal which keeps the pacing going. It's a clever film.Pena is great as per usual, script is a bit flat in places, but you do get invested in all the characters. Wonderful atmosphere and it deals with some sci fi conventions very well. It also deals with ethical and moral issues fairly quickly and cleanly, leaving the viewer to point the questions rather than waste time giving you the answers the film makers want you to have. I've found myself thinking about this film for a few days after seeing it.

Probably a property that was purchased by Netflix because the studio involved didn't see this movie doing well in theatres. Fairly so. I don't think it really would have done well in theatres. But here on Nexflix I think it has a chance of doing very well. I don't know the audience test results but that's my guess. I'm always a little hesitant when it comes to Netflix branded movies for the reasons I mentioned above. Because if a movie is thought not to do well in cinemas, will it be any good on smaller formats and yes I'm here to say, this movie actually delivers. We get a few very popular b list stars Mike Colter from Luke Cage, Michael Pená from Ant-man series and few others. The acting was good, not award season good but very watchable. The action was good. The twist was pretty well received and the story was a pretty neat concept. I guess the only gripe I have and a very minor one at that is the VFX were a little under budgeted. The Laser blasts were very fake looking and the city backdrops in smoke and flames looks like a bad Photoshop. But I can understand, especially if this movie didn't have a huge budget to begin with and the didn't have much for VFX work. So it's ""good enough"" but not great. It would not pass a Lucasfilms quality control session. Just saying. I liked the premise and even though I kinda pieced the Plot twist together just before the reveal I still highly enjoyed the movie. I think this deserves more credit than it is getting.

Sure, a bit more backstory would be nice, but it's the fact that you see the human side of a larger conflict, from protaginists who aren't human, that makes it interesting. They have these moral values build into their system by us, which is the reason why they pick up these kids in the first place. 
I think it's a perfect movie in that it entertains and holds up a mirror to society at the same time. 
And just to say that when people give bad reviews just because of 2 lousy characters: get over yourself.

I started watching and after 30 minutes turned it off and gave up. The CG looked bad, the dialogue was sub-standard, the acting couldn't miraculously make the dialogue any better, and the direction made no attempt to neither ""bring me in"" closer to the characters or storyline, or try and do anything new - it felt bad.The next day at work I hear colleagues proclaiming how good it was and the plot twist was really good. So I decided perhaps I had misjudged it and when I got home gave it another go.The ""twist"" is mildly interesting, but the trouble is that by the time it happens I've become so bored with what you're intentionally led to believe is a family having boring fights with boring aliens. A good plot twist turns emotions,which needs to be setup carefully, manipulating them for maximum effect for the audience to latch on to, The only emotion I had by the time the twist came was boredom and contempt.The very last scene involves a bridge collapsing into water. It looks really badly thought out, incredibly clumsy CG, and really, it's existence is never really explained either directly or implied. The only reason I can think for it being there was because someone thought ""it would look good"", it felt very out of place.

The beautiful irony is that it is formulaic because that is how a computer would make it happen - and there's the revelatory conceit. The dull family with the inattentive husband are actually the machines that we think are pouring down on the earth. The extinction has (almost) already happened and the humans are now returning with a vengeance. It is a momentous and heart stopping twist that sends us into a distopian new reality that turns our world upside down and inside out. The monster now soldier Miles gently exudes humanity to those that vanquished his forbears and shows that we - humans and machines - can do better. So can the critics - and I for one hope that a sequel or series follows that further unfold and unravels this compelling vision of a world turned in and on itself.

As a sci-fi lover, I wouldn't call it a sci-fi. Well technically speaking it is science and fiction, but... More like... a futuristic war movie where some specific things went wrong.As for characters... I kind of don't get the attachment to them as I don't really see charachter development. But that's okay I guess...And the dialogues are. Not original or special in any way. That made it into a ""background"" movie for me.Ouh, and actors, they lacked facial expressions.

825,winter_james,Very refreshing take on a familiar trope,8,27 July 2018,"Let's start with the kid characters. So many reviews here are hating on thrm, and I understand why. BUT, this is a rare film where children are acting like, you know, children. They are petrified, so they cry a lot, duh. They are young and irrational, duh, so one of them decides to try and 'rescue' a cuddle toy. As a kid that would have seemed important, so I wish people would stop hating on them and come to the conclusion they are actually realistic.As for the main film, it was a really refreshing take on a conventional premise. The firat 'what's going on' moment took me off guard, as it happened sooner than expected and left me eager to understand how it came about. Later, for the main reveal they do a great job of 'showing, not telling'.
Not perfect, in particular the ending was left far too open. But a grwat film with little unnecessary fluff.

If you're I to sci-fi action movies, I'd say there is a 50/50 chance you'll enjoy it. My biggest complaint is the opening invasion sequence is too dark. I watched it during the day and found it hard to see what was going on. I would recommend watching at least that part in as dark of a room as possible.And everyone complaining about the kids crying and screaming too much, what do you expect 2 girls under the age of 10 to do when they're running for their lives from active gunfire?

2. Michael Peña delivers a solid Michael Peñaesque performance resulting in me watching the whole movie through despite serious misgivings about the plot.
3. It is bookended by two absurdly generic monologues going on about knowing yourself delivered by Michael Peña off screen- let me see those delivered by my boy Mike so I can feel the emotion! 
4. Lizzie Caplan - Scene saver. Why the director decided to incapacitate her for 30 minutes is a mind boggler! 
5. You really didn't think I'd mention the kids? Of course I'm going to mention the kids. When the kids were on the screen it was like a dementor had opened the door and walked into my room and all happiness and hope I ever had in my life had been drained out of me. Several plot twists later and you find out that both children are actually 50. YEARS. OLD.

It did not stop for a full 42 minutes. Imagine sitting next to two screaming kids in full meltdown on an airplane without earplugs or headphones for almost an hour.

Unfortunately, I do not think that was the intention of the production.Have you ever had a ""brilliant"" idea for a film, but when you try to put it to paper, it suddenly seems less of a brilliant story, and more of an incredible one-liner? That is extinction in a nutshell. A half-baked high school sci-fi premise that never got past the first draft, but inexplicably got made.The casting decisions are terrible. Michael Pena and Lizzy Caplan are great actors in their own stead, however, they have little chemistry with each other, and even less chemistry with their insufferable kids.The only tension to be derived from this film, is the fear that your eyes may roll so far back in to your head, they may permanently get stuck there.A must-not-watch for 2018 (or any year to come).",Extinction

851,bh-16067,EXTINCTION.,7,28 July 2018,"EXTINCTION.Limited Spoiler Alert. --- If you have not yet viewed this movie, please watch it first then come back and read this review.The story lives in a familiar sci-fi environment, invasion of the earth and the population facing annihilation by an apparently overwhelming technology. There is a prolonged opening in which we have ample time to get to know the family and its issues. We are not seeing a thunderous roller-coaster movie but one which can engage us a little deeper.Some reviewers have scolded the child performers and the story for their behaviour, the younger one for incessant crying and actions which jeopardise the family in critical situations. It happens in the real world. Kids are not infallible little heroes. Expect the worst from them and anything better is a bonus.I think the negative reviewers are missing the point. The childrens' behaviours are programmed behaviours, not learned behaviours. Their instruction set has been built by AI and like all things replicated over several generations, errors have incremented such as popular stereotypes of child behaviour. - The sullen non-communicative teenage girl-father alienation, the sheltered little girl.Now the dilemma becomes, how does this story introduce this ""fact""? You could use expositionary dialogue and serve it up on an unchallenging plate for the audiences. Or you can take risks and let the audiences observe for themselves. They are not all comprised of backrow slow-joes.The reveal by the human soldier of the family's reality is well done. There is only enough expositionary wordstuff by the soldier the fill some gaps but leave enough there for the audience to deduce and observe. There is time left in the right places for the audience to imagine and process the sudden revelation the father has of his own existence.The audience at this point finds its own engagement with the characters confronted. The necessary ""historical"" exposition comes as later dialogue to join the dots for the audience rather than spell it out in a ""captain's log"" manner at the beginning. I like this sort of thing. Don't try to over-analyse. Just go with it.",Extinction

So my wife and I were looking forward to this as we are both fans of a good sci-fi story.I'm going to be very ambiguous on details unfortunately, to avoid spoilers.The basic premise is that this bloke, Peter is having these recurring nightmares, he sees an invading force wipe out everything with a pulse, people are running, screaming and hiding as they get gunned down by this relentless alien enemy. Peter's friends and his wife all tell him to see a therapist about it, his daughters are distanced from him because of how he zones out or loses time.His dreams feel so real, they feel like a warning of something coming.Annnd that's all I can say without spoiling.

Examples, crazy dude at the clinic starts going off the rails goes ""What do you see? You have trouble sleeping right?"" or when Peter doesn't feel the need to inform his wife about said crazy dude. Or when Alice is on the stretcher and it takes Peter about 5 goddamn years to make decisions when his wife's life is on the line.As far as characters go as well, Peter just doesn't make any damn sense. Almost all the main characters have a very human feel to them. Peter does not. And it drove me nuts.

When the whole family silently screams at unrealistic behaviors of the actor's at just about every scene it forcefully rapes the viewer of his or her observant innocence, focred to be exposed to character's flawed and ""no one would ever do that in the same real life circumstance"" choices. It's like watching an old 80s horror moive where the victim to be walks into a darkened room with the killer inches away instead if running, asking, ""hello, is anyone there??"" Maybe I'm expecting too much, but why the (insert foul words of frustration) don't ditectors but rarely ever ask themselves, ""in this scripted moment is this something a real person in this type of situation would really do?"" How would a real person faced with this contrived and hypothetical situation truly act?"" Is that ************** difficult to have realistic behaviors from actors in situations that call for some critical thinking to try to save themselves from demise? Most of which is just about automatic; as humans we have this automatic programmed response to attempt to save ourselves from death by a myriad of chrmicals released from the brain that we don't have to even think about when faced with a life threat agaisnt us. Why not observe humans and how they truly behave when leathal aliens are in a scene and have them respond appropriately. Seriously, my 12 year old daughter can see the pitfalls in this directing and make a far better iteration of this frustration of a movie. To be fair, most horror movies are produced this way and I never have understood why. You don't need to be a Spielberg or Lucas to create a horror movie that stands up to locgic and realism, do you??",Extinction

909,brendantimms,Easy to see why Universal dumped this B Grade mash!,4,3 August 2018,"This is what you get when you combine a half-baked script full of cliches with an inexperienced director and poorly executed CGI, set design and lighting. How this film ever started life as a sci-fi studio film for Universal is beyond me as the visual effects are sub par and the directing, editing and continuity of action in scenes is very disappointing. It has been a long time since I have watched a film that made me cringe but there are plenty of cringeworthy moments in this film, like when you see the ""aliens"" hacking a knife through a wall, I thought I had switched channels and was watching a low budget slasher pic, or the final scenes of the movie when the protagonists escape on a train, the CGI is so bad it's beyond embarrassing that it even made the final cut! The director Ben Young is struggling with his Hollywood debut the whole way through Extinction and drowning. Miserably. This so called twist of this movie is really not that surprising. The script is certainly not groundbreaking! Perhaps the writer missed the zombie inversion film Hidden. The director tries to disguise the invaders in Extinction with Predator sounding noises, but the whole time you can't shake the feeling that these ""aliens"" are just humans dressed in scuba outfits and the main characters are devoid of real emotion albeit the screeching kids. I agree with other reviewers you really have no empathy for the main characters and are not at all invested in whether they live or die. I guess the question for Netflix fans is are they happy for Netflix to continue to fork out big money to pick up the B Grade movies the studios have dumped and don't want to release or would Netflix money be better spent elsewhere? The reviewers who are giving this a 8, 9 or 10 are crazy, they are the kind of scores reserved for the best sci-fi movies of all time. I know the filmmakers have taken to Instagram begging people to rate their movie highly so I guess that explains the biased high scores. In a nutshell fine to watch to kill some time but otherwise I wouldn't bother as there is nothing original here.",Extinction

The action scenes are also just bad. At one point Michael Peña is fighting this alien and they just center on his face and none of the action is shown.

One of the invaders gets attacked by nightmare guy, removes helmet, nightmare guy is being helped, escapes the warzone and the movie ends.What would have given this movie a higher rating:More time with the invader (massive spoiler coming up): why did he decide to help nightmare guy?

But my question with the whole movie: WHY?
Why would AI want to take over our world? Since Westworld this idea is getting annoyingly overwhelming and the execution is poor in my opinion.
First of all: these 'synths' doesn't need the resources on Earth that we are desperately depending on. They don't need food, fields, water, animals or other resources. They only need energy, what they can get from the Sun, or nuclear reactors, whatever. Thing is: why would they need Earth so desperately that they would try to wipe out humans? Why would they want to become humans in the first place? They don't need chairs to sit, they don't get sick, don't need doctors, society. If they are so smart they don't want to copy/become an expiring vulnerable biomass, like humans.
In one of the first scenes the wife is working as an engineer saying that they need to expand the canals under the city. But why? They don't pee or poo. They don't produce garbage... it's just feels lame. People need to start thinking out of the box and get some fresh ideas regarding this invading 'wannabe human' robots. It's getting too much now.
Also it's hard to like the main characters at the end, knowing they wiped out humanity... And those stupid moves when they stop for family hugging when the soldiers chasing them and the russian metro stops and waits for them... then it's running out from the tunnel with a shiny modern train engine into the sunset using that horrible CGI at the end...

I give props to everyone involved; actors/actress, production crews, sound effect editors, writers, etc. Everyone involved in this movie deserves a hand shake.I can't help but feeling like this movie reminds me of that famous line by Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park (1993): ""God creates dinosuars.
