0,SnoopyStyle,waiting,6,27 May 2017,"It's one week in the life of Paterson (Adam Driver). He's a bus driver in Paterson, New Jersey. He lives with his wife Laura and their dog Marvin. She dreams of starting a cupcake business. Paterson observes his riders and writes poetry in his notebook. He spends his spare time at Doc's bar.This is a Jim Jarmusch film through and through. It's silly to talk about plot since there is barely one. Adam Driver is putting together an interesting resume. There is so much behind the facade. He is not asked to do any big acting but he still delivers little moments. The cutest is Paterson forced to use a kiddie cell phone from a little girl after the bus breaks down. Mostly, the film leaves me waiting for something bigger to happen. Nothing ever does but the ride does provide interesting moments.",Paterson
1,Horst_In_Translation,7 days in the life of Paterson,8,30 November 2016,"""Paterson"" is a new American movie from this year (2016). It runs for almost two hours and was written and directed by multiple Cannes Film Festival winner Jim Jarmusch. This connection or also Jarmusch's older films should give you a pretty good imagination what to expect with this movie. The lead actor is Adam Driver and his co-lead is Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani and these two names (maybe even only the former) are probably the only actors you have heard before watching this one. Driver is of course known for Star Wars, but his early fame came from the television series ""Girls"", for which he scored several Emmy nominations. In this movie we have here, he plays a bus driver. We follow him for a week, day by day, and see what his relatively ordinary life is like. We find out about his poetry, about how he loves to spend his evenings at a local pub and about his job as well. But sometimes he did not even feel as the exact essence of the film. It is definitely also a lot about the smaller characters here, such as the barkeeper or the other bar guests or Paterson's girlfriend. We find out a bit about all of these and I thought this is one of the main reasons why the movie worked out so well. It is packed with interesting characters.Driver was a really good casting choice. While I have never been a huge ""Girls"" fan, I quite like him as an actor and he has that whole subtlety thing going for him as he really shines when playing rather quiet characters. Farahani is a stunning beauty and I sure hope we get to see more from her in the future in Hollywood films. I can't believe they are missing out on her. Of course, she is also a pretty decent actress and her character felt really authentic to me. I liked the black/white references, her likable mood swings when it comes to who she wants to be: a successful singer or a successful bakery businesswoman. It changes from day to day and that was pretty hilarious, but it still makes me as an audience member happy when she comes somewhat closer to her dream and it also makes Paterson happy who loves her very much obviously and she really loves him too. What sets the movie apart from other generic comedies are certainly the poetry parts. Initially, I thought it is just a nice little hobby for him, which is also what an audience member may think when listening to Paterson's poems for the first time, but the longer the film goes (with Paterson's references about the known writer or the conversation with the girl who writes her own poetry), the more it becomes obvious how this is really the area of his life which Paterson puts all his heart in, outside the relationship with his significant other of course. As a consequence, in the dramatic event of what happens Saturday night (which was a bit predictable, but not a problem at all), you can feel Paterson's pain really and see how he suffers from his loss and this is maybe the moment when Driver shines the most in this film.In order to avoid being too enthusiastic, I would like to say that there were 2 or 3 things I did not like that much. The only somewhat bad moment was probably the scene with the gun at the bar because the entire film was supposed to be about a bit of an average week for the title character, but this one scene was clearly a break in tone and atmosphere for me, even if they still made the most of it with nobody overreacting other than the guests who did not know the actor character. Paterson's reaction also did not convince me too much as he seemed a bit too much of a hero there, maybe it was supposed to be a link to his military past, but I could have done very well without it. I also did not appreciate the final scene with the Japanese guy that much really, even if it is pretty significant in terms of getting Paterson to write again. I think there could have been more effective ways of closing the film. The gun scene and a couple other moments, like what happened to the book or the bus malfunction actually make it a not so average week for Paterson, even if with the last Monday shot, it all seemed back to normal again I guess. Another word on the bus malfunction: the reference about the vehicle possibly exploding and turning into a ball of fire was nice and I liked how Paterson and the barkeeper made fun of Jarmusch's words in the last mention of this metaphor about how Farahani's character and the old lady used the exact same words. To me, ""Paterson"" is one of my favorite films of the year, currently at number one even, but of course there will be many more quality films still coming out. And Driver's approach also creates one of the most likable film characters of the year for sure. He loves writing, does not have a mobile phone (and does not want one), is in a loving relationship and is loyal to his friends. What more can you want? Now please go and see this gem of a movie. I have not seen too much Jarmusch yet and from what I have seen so far, it was okay, but I was not that impressed. ""Paterson"" changes my perception of JJ completely. You really don't wanna miss out on this wonderful character study.",Paterson

3,george.schmidt,Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's tone poem if you will to art imitating life and vice verse,8,3 March 2017,"PATERSON (2017) *** Adam Driver, Golshifteh Farahani, Barry Shabaka Henley, Rizwan Manji, Chasten Harmon, William Jackson Harper, Method Man. Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's tone poem if you will to art imitating life and vice verse with his trademark loosey goosey direction and laid-back writing serve well for titular character Driver (nearly sad-sack enough but sublime to a fault), a NJ Transit bus driver with a gift for fluid poetry he writes daily as part of his routine in the town of, yes, Paterson. Languid, lovely and light-hearted but with surprising depth and poignancy of self-discoveries, self-doubt and the overcome of love itself. Ethereal Farahani as his aspirational girlfriend, droopy-pussed barkeep Henley and beguiling hottie Harmon add some flavor as well as the lovely cinematography by Frederick Elmes and languid editing by Affonso Goncalves.",Paterson
4,evanston_dad,The Road Not Taken,8,4 May 2017,"Adam Driver gives a terrific performance as the title character (which also happens to be the city in which the film is set) in this quiet Jim Jarmusch film about the different paths life can take.Driver plays a humble bus driver in a loving relationship living an unassuming life but with a rich artistic impulse rumbling just under the surface. He moves through his daily routine creating poetry out of the mundane details he sees, and we occasionally sense that he's more frustrated with his place in life, and the stifling of his artistic sensibilities, than he ever lets himself convey. ""Paterson"" is one of those movies that I think captures something inherently true about the discontentment present in most everyone's life, whether or not they want to admit it's there. Routines aren't necessarily bad, and one can build a quite content and even intermittently happy life out of simple pleasures, but it's the rare person who doesn't spend a good portion of his/her life wondering how much happier he/she might have been if she had taken it in a different direction.Because this is Jim Jarmusch, whether or not one likes the film will probably come down to whether or not one likes Jarmusch's style of filmmaking.Grade: A",Paterson
5,ferguson-6,poetry in life,8,18 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Do you find poetry in everyday life? What about poets  do you envision loners whose lives are filled with angst and suffering? Our lead character here is a pretty normal guy who drives a city bus, has a happy marriage, and walks his dog each evening. He's also a poet – and a pretty interesting one.Writer/director Jim Jarmusch (Broken Flowers, 2005) often seems like he is making films for his circle of friends  all whom must be much cooler than you and me. This time, however, he takes an opposite approach and brilliantly focuses on a dude that any of us could know. Paterson (Adam Driver) is a New Jersey Transit bus driver who writes poetry based on his observations of life's seemingly minor details (his first poem notes ""We have plenty of matches in our house"").You should be forewarned: there are no murders, kidnappings, bank robberies or shootouts. Things move rather deliberately. Also missing are any special effects – heck, Adam Driver even got licensed to drive a bus for the role. Instead, we are forced to slow down and see each of the seven days of a week through the eyes and words of Paterson. He observes. He listens. He people watches. He then commits his thoughts to the page and recites them for our benefit. Sometimes he is eavesdropping on bus passengers, while other times he curiously tries to figure out the newest ""dream"" for his beloved wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani). Having the soul of an artist, Laura cloaks her world in a geometric black and white color scheme while energetically bounding from cupcakes to country and western music to cooking as she pursues her place in life.There are many Jarmusch touches throughout. Paterson the poet actually lives and works in Paterson, New Jersey  yep, Paterson from Paterson. The interactions at the neighborhood bar (run by Barry Shabaka Henley) are simultaneously real and surreal – right down to the wall of local fame (including Hurricane Carter and Lou Costello, but no mention of Larry Doby). Coincidences abound. A young girl recites her poem to Paterson  her writing style, personal book, and delivery make her seem like his poetic doppelganger – all while the recurring appearance of numerous sets of twins make us believe in the law of attraction. Lastly, the closest thing to a villain in the film is Paterson's bulldog Marvin, in what plays like a love-hate relationship with the mailbox being center-ring.Another local Paterson (the city) aspect is Paterson's (the poet) admiration of the works of William Carlos Williams, a poet whose style he emulates. One of the terrific scenes near the end involves a spontaneous interaction between Paterson and town visitor (Masatoshi Nagase) that takes place next to The Great Falls, and serves as a reminder that we should accept who we are, no matter the challenges or lack of glory. This is truly director Jarmusch's ode to the artist/poet in each of us and in ordinary life. Creating art as best we can is a very personal thing, and for some it's a need - while for others it's one of life's simple pleasures. Regardless, a ""normal"" life with daily routines is not to be scorned, but rather embraced, should you be so fortunate. If you doubt this, Paterson asks, ""Would you rather be a fish?"" **NOTE: sharp moviegoer eyes will recognize Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman, who both had their debut in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (2012).",Paterson
6,siderite,"Poetry as film. Atmospheric, refreshing, really boring.",7,1 October 2017,"I can't possibly do justice to this movie because, frankly, I didn't understand it. I get that it is a sort of adaptation of the epic Paterson poem into a movie, but why would someone do that is beyond me. The acting was good, the direction was excellent, I sincerely cannot imagine a better movie adaptation of the subject, which is a bus driver called Paterson, driving his bus in Paterson.Now, I guess there could be entire pages dedicated to the film. The way it was made, shot, the rhythm, the analogies to the poetic style, the artistic references in the script, the symbolism and so on. But really, what this film is about is a week in the life of a really introverted bus driver.Bottom line: you need to be in a certain mood and be a certain kind of person to really appreciate it.",Paterson
7,namashi_1,Poetry In Motion!,10,12 June 2017,"Jim Jarmusch reminds us why Poetry defines our lives with 'Paterson', his cinematic triumph. Subtle, Beautiful & Heartbreaking, Jarmusch delivers an unforgettable tale on life, with an astounding central performance by the impeccable Adam Driver as Paterson.'Paterson' is A quiet & affecting observation of the triumphs and defeats of daily life, along with the poetry evident in its smallest details, seen through the lives of Paterson, a bus driver who's a poet at heart & his wife Laura, who aspires to be a music country star & also open a cupcake business. 'Paterson' is narrated richly in a week-long span in the lives of Paterson & Laura. And its something to be witnessed & felt. Its so realistic & affecting, that I almost felt I'm barging over the lives of these people. 'Paterson' is about life & that there is poetry even in its smallest moments. Its a story about how & why you want to matter in the world, even though it can be in the smallest way possible. We watch the protagonist & his wife fight life at every moment & its all done in a manner that appears real & at the same time, beautiful. I found myself arrested to my seat from start to finish & even though there was major scope for monotony here, I never felt it.Jarmusch is in top-form! 'Paterson' is a Masterstroke from this Master Storyteller. His Writing is pure emotion & the use of poetry, is indeed brilliant. His Direction, as always, is fantastic. Its so sad that the Academy or any other Award Ceremony, didn't honor Jarmusch for his work here. A film like 'Paterson' comes right from the heart & grips your soul. It deserved many honors. Cinematography & Editing are marvelous.Performance-Wise: Adam Driver's portrayal of Paterson, is simply astounding. Again, what was the Academy thinking when they snubbed this acting masterclass? Driver delves deep into his portrayal & delivers a flawless performance. Right from his body-language to his subtlety in dialogue, Driver is a marvel from start to end. Lending him great support is the Gorgeous Golshifteh Farahani, who's extraordinary as his wife, Laura. The two performers make 'Paterson' an even more unforgettable experience. On the whole, 'Paterson' is Pure Cinematic Joy! Two Big Thumbs Up!",Paterson
8,blanbrn,A film of hope and dreams and a want to escape the norms of daily life!,6,15 July 2017,"""Patterson"" is one independent film that's a journey it does let the mind escape and it's a showcase that shows daily life is the norm and it asks and shows that one must want more and think outside the norm. Set in Patterson, New Jersey the film is about one guy named Patterson(Adam Driver)oddly enough and he has a simple one as he works as a bus driver as he observes the city and people and he hears the plain speak and talk, all of this has Patterson to pick up on a love of poetry causing him to become a want to be writer. Aside from that he walks to the local bar for drinks and tends to his cute bulldog. Enter his wife Laura who's also a dreamer type and she supports Patterson's every move. The film unfolds day by day in a simple manner showing that thru life observations lead to ideals and the hope for bigger and better dreams of escape and belonging.",Paterson
9,Hellmant,"A well made, and quite memorable, movie; in classic Jim Jarmusch style.",8,17 February 2017,"'PATERSON': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new film from writer/director Jim Jarmusch. It's another critically acclaimed quirky drama (that's received nearly unanimous positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes) about an aspiring poet, that's working as a bus driver in Paterson, New Jersey. The poet is coincidentally also named Paterson, and he's married to another aspiring artist, named Laura. The movie stars Adam Driver and Golshifteh Farahani, as it's two leads. I found the film to be just as quirky as Jarmusch's other work, and it's also just as interesting. Driver is a perfectly quirky lead actor for a Jim Jarmusch movie too, and Farahani is quite lovely in it!The film takes place over one week in the lives of Paterson (Driver) and Laura (Farahani). Paterson is a bus driver (in Paterson, New Jersey) who also writes poetry, which he keeps to himself. His wife Laura is always encouraging him to do more with his poems, while she works on her own art as well. Paterson's days follow a similar pattern each day; as he listens to the passengers' converse on his bus, as well as the patrons at a local bar he visits, and he also writes poetry in his spare time. This week, Paterson's life takes a sudden turn for the worse though. What I like most about the film, is when Paterson is just listening to the conversations of people on his bus. You get a brief look at the lives of all kinds of different people. The movie really does feel like just a week in the lives of everyday folk. People with ambitious dreams, that are stuck doing monotonous things every day instead (much like myself). Driver and Farahani also make a beautiful couple in the film (even though she's far too stunning for him). It's a well made, and quite memorable, movie; in classic Jim Jarmusch style.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY",Paterson
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Celebrates the mundane in a surprisingly entertaining and subtly life-affirming way.,7,1 March 2018,"'Paterson (2016)' is a feature built entirely upon, and indeed celebrating, the mundane. It follows a seemingly regular week in the life of a bus-driving poet and doesn't stray too far from the confines of reality, whilst still managing to have a fair amount to say and packing a hefty level of symbolism into its relatively layered narrative. The character work is nice and deep, even though there are really only two major ones, and the film works within the smallest of margins to deliver its changes and growth but still certainly delivers both. It also feels palpably real and remains remarkably entertaining. It's a nice, subtly life-affirming feature that isn't ground breaking but is sort of beautiful in its own unique, low-key kind of way. 7/10",Paterson
11,Reno-Rangan,"A week with a bus driver, a part time poet.",9,13 October 2017,"The time Jim Jarmusch has struck back. He does not make films often, but those he makes are not easily forgettable. I don't think people hate his films, especially the grown ups. They know how hard the real life is and contents this filmmaker use for his flicks are not much different. But the thing is, in his style, adding a slight fun, romantic, poetic, all together works so well. I still remember how I become his fan after watching 'Stranger Than Paradise'.As usual, he wrote the story for this film. Even if he had to borrow from another source, the screenplay is generally his. For this film, it was original and that's what worked out awesomely. But he had to borrow some poems from his favourite poet, Ron Padgett. A great team work, because when their work came together, the film became a masterpiece. It was nothing less than any literature, for sure. Definitely this film should turn into a book. The readers deserve their own imagination of this tale.This is the story of a man's life in a week's time. Starts from Monday and ends on next Monday. So, his name's Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson. A happily married man, and love his profession. In the meantime, he's a poet. He has kept a book where he writes his poems, especially during his lunch time, even in the small breaks when he gets. His mind's always filled with thoughts. Chanting words, verses.His inspirations are the places he goes through his bus and the strangers who ride in his bus. Their each others conversation about their lives and experiences is his motivation. His wife is an interesting character too. Sadly, she was not focused as much as he was. Though there are enough scenes to enjoy the role. But I think she deserves her solo film, from another angle, about her life, her hobby which her husband backs.It's a simple, normal life. Without much trouble, a peaceful life the most people would ask for. The film is not everything about him. But he's the centre of the story. When other, one time characters enter the screen. It's because of his presence around them. Hence some interesting facts revealed. Just like our life when we ride a public transport where we come in to contact with many passengers coming and going in different stops. But all the above, what they talk, which we, everybody in the bus listen without hesitation. Paterson is a person who learns every day out of that.❝Poetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.❞His other activity is walking his dog out at every night. It's an opportunity for him to mix with some friends at the pub he had made with frequent visits. The place which has its own story as the film progresses. So all these stuffs keeps repeating every day like what we call a mechanical life. But Paterson is neither enjoying it nor depressed over. He usually does best out of the given time and place. The difference is, not every day are same. Even a slight change in order of activity brings a new thing in. His wife insists him to publish his works. But the narration strikes with an unexpected twist before the end.I have said many times when I liked the films I have watched that they are so poetic. But it's very rare to find a film from top to bottom being very poetic. Recently I saw one, in fact, two from Japan known as 'Little Forest' duology. And now this one. Particularly if you love poetry or if you are yourself a poet, then this is a must see. Surely you would love it. As well as a good film to gift to any such person you know in your life. Believe me, this film is like a wine bottle. As it gets older, it will turn the best. I have already changed my stance twice and rated better every time. I consider it is a bit low rated right now. But only time will answer to that.For me, it is the director's top 3 films. I have seen Adam Driver in many films, he's not considered a solo lead actor, because of marketing purpose. But he's really good which proved in this flick. So it is his best performance I have seen so far. He really took the driving classes to learn drive the bus to perfect his character. That's the dedication the creator of the film expects from his cast. How much I loved it means, I'm eager for a sequel, despite knowing this kind of films are one-off. Otherwise, I'll be happy if the director and him join the hands once more time for a new project.Very slow moving tale. But not a boring film. If I had watched it when I was a teenager, I don't think I would have felt similarly. From middle aged people to the older ones, they are the target audience. In order to see and feel what this film reveals, one must have experience in real life. Hence, not all the youngsters, particularly the teenagers would thumb up. In my world, this kind of films is the Oscar worthy. I would have surely nominated the film, as well as the director and the lead actor. So by now you would have learnt what my final word could be. Recommended!8/10",Paterson
12,Red-125,Excellent film that avoids stereotypes,10,6 February 2017,"The film Paterson (2016) was written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. It stars Adam Driver as Paterson, who happens to live in Paterson, New Jersey. Paterson is a bus driver, who has a pretty mundane life. He gets up each workday morning, says goodbye to his wife, eats a bowl of Cheerios, walks to the bus garage, greets the dispatcher, and begins to drive the bus on his route. Bus 23 passes through downtown, which looks no better or worse than the downtown of any medium-size Rustbelt city.Paterson can overhear conversations, which are sometimes interesting, sometimes not, but are never violent or threatening. There are no explosions, no violence, and no hostility on the bus. Stereotypically, a guy who drives a bus in Paterson, New Jersey should be a pretty ordinary guy.That stereotype would be wrong in Paterson's case, because he's a brilliant poet. He writes the poetry in his head when he's driving, and then writes it into a notebook when he's not working. The poetry was written by Ron Padgett, who is clearly a great poet. (I'm going to buy one of his books.)The second matter that keeps Paterson from being an ordinary guy is his wife, Laura. She's portrayed by Golshifteh Farahani. Laura is a unusual woman. She doesn't work outside the home, although she makes cupcakes to sell at the farmer's marker. She mostly works inside the home--covering every inch of the house with black and white decorations. (Even the cupcakes all have black and white frosting.) Laura loves Paterson, and, in her quirky way, she's endearing. The problem is that Golshifteh Farahani is impossibly beautiful. It's hard to believe that she's staying home and baking cupcakes in Paterson, New Jersey when she could be a model in New York City. I wish Jarmusch had picked an actor who could realistically be Paterson's wife. The question is, would he and we think her charming if she weren't so beautiful?This is a truly excellent movie. We saw it at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, New York, but it will work almost as well on the small screen. Don't miss it!",Paterson
13,leplatypus,"As usual, when a director is labeled Author, the movies are overrated (web)",4,11 April 2017,"And it's the same about poetry: we are expected to praise it whereas it's totally unintelligible or flatly plain! So here we have an author filming poetry! However, the movie starts well with a worker getting up early to drive a bus all along the day before getting back to his gentle and caring wife at home and going out with the dog. So Monday is cool even if his poetic inspiration and discussion ring already false. Next day, it's the same and it's repeated 5 times until the week-end! So it's pretty boring: If Goldsifeth illuminates the movie by her humanity, her big heart and her B/W artistic feeling, her sluggish boyfriend is just too much passive: he is like sleeping all the time, has nearly no reaction... So for me, this 2 hours movie was reduced to 30 minutes (all GF scenes) as all the rest was just insipidly shot! And don't tell me it's about poetry or deeply inspired just because it's about everyday life... Our working life has nothing to do with poetry but those who have never work hard like those so-called authors can't understand !!",Paterson
14,howard.schumann,Life itself is poetry,9,18 October 2016,"I'm not sure if Jim Jarmusch (""Only Lovers Left Alive"") in Paterson wants to make America great again by giving us his vision of the way it used to be, or is telling us that we only have to look around us to discover that it's great right now. Performed by a brilliantly authentic Adam Driver (""Midnight Special""), Paterson is not only the name of the city in New Jersey known for its resident poet William Carlos Williams, but is also his name. He is a poet whose Haiku-like verses (actually written by Ron Padgett) are reminiscent of the city's own poet William Carlos Williams. He writes a new poem every day (or finishes an old one) on the #23 bus he drives before and during his trip. Though his loving, energetic, somewhat scattered wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani, ""Finding Altamira"") keeps asking him to make copies of them, he resists the idea, preferring to keep them in his secret notebook.The film has little conflict, family dysfunction, or mental health issues. It is about what works and even (wonder of wonders) about a marriage that is not falling apart. Like most people with jobs and families, Paterson has a daily routine. There's too much variation in his day to call it a takeoff on Groundhog Day, but it does have that ""same old, same old"" quality. He awakes shortly after 6am, has a bowl of cereal that looks suspiciously like Cheerios, walks to his job driving the #23 bus through the streets of Paterson, listening in on conversations (often with a broad smile on his face) of passengers who talk about anything from Italian anarchists to boxer Hurricane Carter and comedian Lou Costello.He comes home at six, corrects a leaning mailbox that moves daily thanks to his grumpy English bulldog Marvin (RIP), has dinner (some on the exotic side) talks with Laura who fills him in on the many projects she has going on including painting black and white circles on draperies, learning to play the guitar, and making cupcakes to sell at the local farmers market. He then takes Marvin for a walk and goes for a beer at the local pub where he chats with the owner Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley, ""Carrie""), and often acts as a moderator between Everett (William Jackson Harper, ""True Story""), a dramatic actor who desperately wants to reunite with his ex-wife Maria (Chasten Harmon.The poems that Paterson reads as the words are flashed on the screen are not about odes to nightingales (though there's nothing wrong with that) but about down-to-earth things, such as one about matches, inspired by Ohio Blue Tip matchboxes that have disappeared from our lives. In ""The Run,"" he says, ""I go through trillions of molecules that move aside to make way for me while on both sides trillions more stay where they are. The windshield wiper blade starts to squeak. The rain has stopped. I stop. On the corner a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand."" In other poems he lets the world know how much he is in love with his wife, though he confides in us that he occasionally looks at other woman, something which as far as I know is still legal.To Paterson, a poem should be simple and direct and he is moved by one such poem by a 9-year-old girl who recites it to him while she is waiting for her mother and sister. He complements her on her poem about a waterfall, remembering a few lines and reciting them to Laura when he gets home. Contrary to most films where, except for films about wealthy financial elites, work does not play a big role in the life of the characters, Paterson makes real what daily living is about for a majority of working people. The film has warmth and humor wrapped in a portrait of a city which has seen better days, a city in which Jarmusch creates a structure of closely observed small moments revealed with empathy.Paterson is a man who is not looking for life to give him satisfaction but who brings satisfaction to it, a man who knows that satisfaction does not depend on accumulating things but in being grounded in who you are and what you can bring to the world. He comes to appreciate that poetry is not extraneous to life but that life itself is poetry. Although the film presents an idealistic picture of a city without visible slums, drugs, and crime which we know exists, Jarmusch may be providing us with a welcome counterpoint, showing us the way our cities should be and can be again.",Paterson
15,TheMovieDiorama,Paterson is poetic in itself as much as it is about poetry.,8,2 March 2018,"I found this to be an extremely captivating story. We observe a week in the middle of a man's life, a bus driver who utilises the medium of poetry to express him emotions. It's a story about the harsh lows and superlative highs that each day brings and how the smallest of details can change one's perception on a certain view. Paterson, in which Adam Driver gives one heck of an understated performance, is a quiet guy. He keeps himself to himself and just bumbles along life in a routinely fashion. But there are several idiosyncrasies and symbolic traits that make him a fascinating character. He rarely expresses his feelings, and yet when he writes his poetry he is undeniably in love with his monochrome obsessed partner. Her admiration for black and white compliments his mundane life. However, in contrast her life is constantly changing and he is having to adapt to this. There's an underlying melancholic tone throughout the narrative. He knows, deep down, that he is just existing...he isn't living. But his poetry will be his legacy and will make people, perhaps in the future, remember him. Just like any other famous poet in history. I found this to be such a delight! Granted, this will not be for everyone. The pace is slow and the film is focussed on the subtext rather than what's actually happening on screen. For me, this was brilliant. Director Jim Jarmusch did a fine job, plenty on inventive and clean camera shots whether it will be shadows or reflections. Loved the on-screen text of each poem as Paterson reads them out to us, a nice visual touch. There was one thing I just couldn't grasp, and that was with the amount of twins! Why? There must be some meaning behind this that I'm missing. Maybe ever since his wife Laura dreamt about them, he unintentionally and subconsciously is focussing on twins? I don't know, but that's the beauty of the film. So many little details and idiosyncrasies that will have different meanings for different viewers.",Paterson
16,Movie_Muse_Reviews,All the stuff Jarmusch's films are made of in perhaps his most accessible package,9,25 June 2017,"""Paterson"" is a study in simplicity, an artistic reckoning with the ceaseless, repetitive and nevertheless so finite passage of time. Depicting the humdrum American lifestyle with flares of poetic grace, Jim Jarmusch's latest is perhaps the most quintessential of his particular style and maybe even his most accessible film to boot.Jarmusch has long been drawn to poetry, minutiae, mortality and the American Dream. ""Paterson"" is about all these things, neatly wrapped up into a carefully constructed story about a Paterson, New Jersey bus driver (Adam Driver) named for the very town he lives in with his artistically driven wife (Golshifteh Farahani) and their bulldog Marvin, whom Paterson is rather apathetic toward. Not surprisingly, Paterson is also a poet, reticent to share his work with the world.A day-to-day snapshot of one week in Paterson's life provides a firm container for the story, which Jarmusch fills in with an assortment of mundane but noticeable details, like how Paterson eats Cheerios out of a cup every morning and has to straighten out the mailbox every day when he comes home. Setting up this routine forms a foundation that allows for even the slightest change to the rhythm of this couple's life to seem momentous and meaningful to the viewer. Of course, if you know Jarmusch, you know to temper expectations for what might ""shake up"" their humble existence. Rather, he tweaks a little here and there to explore what happens as the monotony of the lives we choose and the lives we dream about reach a crossroads.Jarmusch's approach to directing ""Paterson"" is equally quiet and restrained. The film's repetitive nature allows him to gently usher our eye toward the relevant details in each day depicted. He also lets the actual Paterson setting speak for itself, something many of his films have done well, but it's particularly germane to the content of ""Paterson."" Really, it's the storytelling, which purposefully and gracefully lives in the details, that makes the film resonate.A Jarmusch-Driver collaboration feels fated. Driver shares a lot in look and style with early Jarmusch collaborator John Lurie. He's definitely cool, but also very mysterious. Driver can play that essential Jarmusch protagonist, the character to whom we feel strangely ambivalent. That said, Jarmusch invites us to be invested in and like Paterson more than the vast majority of his previous main characters, though some viewers will go mad waiting for Paterson to express his emotions verbally or physically.Unlike ""Dead Man"" and other of Jarmusch's works that heavily reference poets, authors and other realms of cultural knowledge, ""Paterson"" channels Jarmusch's penchant for the intellectual and literary into something more tangible and malleable. In fewer words, it's accessible. Even if you've never heard a William Carlos Williams poem, Jarmusch incorporates him and his work into the story in such a way that we understand exactly why it's so integral to this movie.""Paterson"" is a beautiful example of art inspired by art. In addition to all the imagery- focused poetry that inspired this movie, Jarmusch creates a lot of inspiring imagery and thought-provoking symbolism, from Paterson's watch to Laura's black-and-white — literally — sense of personal style. Paterson and Laura in so many ways two characters from a poem whose life we get to see play out on screen. Although the same could be argued about many of Jarmusch's films, ""Paterson"" really does fire on all cylinders.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Paterson

18,imseeg,"Most meditative, down to earth picture Jim Jarmush ever made, with a tribute to New Jersey poet Williams. A soothing, sweet story about the ordinary life of a bus driver",8,19 February 2019,"For all of you who have never heard of director Jim Jarmush, beware that his films are incredibly slowburning, resembling watching paint dry. Having said that, it will be the most interesting experience of watching paint dry you have ever had as well. Pictures of Jim Jarmush are always portraits of quirky characters in a forgotten place. ""Paterson"" is exactly that, a portrait of a week of a busdriver's life in Paterson, going about his daily routine. The most dramatic thing that ever happens in this movie is a bus breaking down due to an electrical failure. No action whatsoever. No drama. What is left? A meditative, lovely portrait of a bus driver in Paterson, with some typical Jarmush tongue in cheek jokes.Driving a bus, going home to his wife, eating, sleeping and getting up the next morning again, to repeat the same routine. That's all one gets to see in this movie. It is the talent of Jim Jarmush that he is able to fill a 2 hour long movie about this seemingly boring busdriver's routine and still be funny, fascinating and uplifting.What makes this movie stand out especially for me? It is the meditatively driven attention for detail for everydays thoughts and feelings, which are written down as poems by the busdriver. Everyday conversations he overhears on the bus by passengers. His feelings of love for his young wife. The daily chores, that bug him. All these ordinary things are an inspiration for poems the busdriver is writing down every day.This movie is a tribute to writing poems. All pictures by Jim Jarmush are (hidden) tributes to artists or places in time, which this director has a personal affection with. This movie is a tribute to the place Paterson, but most of all to poet Williams, who wrote about every day life in Paterson extensively for many years. Who is this poet Williams? Below is an exerpt of this poet' s poem about the place Paterson.-Say it, no ideas but in things-nothing but the blank faces of the houses

A lovely example of how an old poem, travels through time and influences many different people along the way, finally resulting in the creation of this this very movie, that you are about to watch...",Paterson
19,paul-allaer,For the love of poems and buses,8,21 January 2017,"""Paterson"" (2016 release; 118 min.) brings the story of a bus driver named Paterson, living in Paterson, NJ. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Monday"", and Paterson is asleep in ed with his girlfriend Laura. Peterson gets ready for work, and walks to the bus depot, where he drives bus route 23, Paterson. On his break he writes a love poem in his ""secret book"". After work and having had dinner with Laura, Paterson males his daily evening walk with Marvin, the couple's dog. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from veteran indie UK writer-director Jim Jarmusch, who most recently brought us ""Only Lovers Left Alive"". Here Jarmusch brings us a quite, intimate little film about the ordinary lives of a lovely couple and a few other people within Peterson's circle. The movie feels like it's made for the love of poems and buses. Ah yes, the poets and their poems. If you don't care for poetry, do yourself a favor and check out a different movie instead, you will thank me later. I quite enjoyed the poems written by the Paterson character (actually penned by Ron Padgett), and along the way you will also learn a thing or two about William Carlos Williams, and others. As it happens, this is the second consecutive weekend that I see Adam Driver in an outstanding performance: last weekend it was in Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" and now this. Wow. Equally enjoyable (and very easy on the eyes) is Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani as Laura. It is a darn shame that she doesn't take on more roles in American films (she is based in Paris). Last but not least, there is a nice electronic score, courtesy of SQURL, a duo consisting Carter Logan and... Jim Jarmusch (yes, the man can do it all!).""Paterson"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely. You could hear a pin drop in the theater at certain moments in the movie. If you are looking for something that is as far away from your average Hollywood big budget action movie, I think you will find ""Paterson"" very much to your liking. ""Paterson"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Paterson
20,subxerogravity,"I don't want to say the movie was bad, because technically it was not, but I was bored out of my mind.",8,19 February 2017,"It was the longest week in the history of long weeks as we spend one with Paterson, a bus driver from...Paterson, New Jersey.I'm sure if you are from Paterson the movie could be a very lovely treat as Paterson the bus driver travels all over the town Paterson, and you might catch a glimpse of the neighborhood that you live in or a store you past by.I did like the segments that happen as Paterson drove his bus through Paterson. He would ease drop on the passengers who all had some witty and interesting conversations about their life. Like these two guys who were trying to prove how alpha male they are to each other.Paterson's job is interesting in it's mundane-ness. I'm sure every person works with that one guy who seems to load all his problems on if you when you say hi to him in passing. I know I do and so does Paterson, which made for some funny moments in the film.Paterson has a pretty hot wife who is an artist and expresses herself freely throughout the house , with every piece of furniture, clothing and food having her signature creative style, and she tries her best to have Paterson express what she deeply sees in him through his poetry.I did like the poetry moments with star Adam Driver narrating the writing as if though he was reading it thinking it and writing it all at the same time.Then Paterson likes to go to the local bar Shades where the bartender gives him the low down on who's who and who was in Paterson New Jersey, referring to his wall of famous people places and things in the area.In Jim Jarmusch attempt to create a character we can all relate to he succeeded, but he also succeeded in putting me to sleep.I've seen Jarmusch tackle the mundane better in films like Mystery Train, so I know he can do it, but I feel Jarmusch maybe patting himself on the back the way we all have been patting him on the back for years over his brilliance. It's like M. Night Shyamalan doing The Lady in the Water after his ego was stroked too many timesSee Jarmusch documentary Gimme Danger instead.",Paterson
21,Turfseer,"Iranian born actress' warm, highly artistic performance saves soporific tale of bus driver-poet from complete disaster",5,4 December 2016,"Jim Jarmusch has served up another one of his lugubrious tales set in Paterson, New Jersey, with a poet-bus driver as his protagonist, also oddly named Paterson. Adam Driver (of Star Wars fame) plays the nondescript bus driver and we get to follow him in his daily activities for a period of one week.Paterson lives with his wife Laura (magisterially played by Iranian born Golshifteh Farahani) in a small house in Paterson. His daily routine includes driving a NJ Transit bus, walking his pit bull Marvin, hanging out at a local pub and writing poetry in a notebook (the words of the poems appear on screen, with scenes from Paterson--particularly some beautiful foliage, appearing in the background).The problem with the story is that Jarmusch's protagonist is basically a wet fish—Driver can do little with a script that features a man of no passion who walks about like an automaton. One wonders why his wife is attracted to such a fellow—can it just be because he writes poetry that she likes and considers him ""sensitive""? Without the poetry (real stuff written by Ron Padgett and dry as its narrator), Paterson seems like the type of guy who would bore anyone to death.Interspersed with Paterson are the characters he runs into throughout the film. They include a co-worker bedeviled by domestic issues; a bartender who enjoys playing chess with himself; a young girl, also a poet who has a mutual affinity with Paterson for Emily Dickinson; a not too confident rapper in a laundromat whom Paterson tries to encourage; a teenager on Paterson's bus who discusses Gaetano Bresci, an anarchist from Paterson who traveled to Italy and assassinated King Umberto I at the turn of the century; and a Japanese tourist who has a great fondness for the poet William Carlos Williams, another long-term Paterson resident.There is little sense of evil in Jarmusch's world--which almost gives Paterson (the film) a fable-like quality. Paterson (the bus driver) at one point is stopped by a bunch of gang bangers in a convertible as he walks Marvin down the street, and is benignly warned about dog snatchers in the neighborhood.The closest Paterson comes to menace is when a love-sick patron at the bar flips out a toy gun after being rejected by a former girlfriend for the umpteenth time. The scene has a cartoonish ending as the bartender declines to dial 911 and allows the jilted offender to walk out of the bar, scot-free.What saves Paterson from complete disaster is the wonderful performance of Golshifteh Farahani as Paterson's supportive wife, Laura. She exudes beauty inside and out, providing an optimistic contrast to Driver's soporific poet. Laura is a fashionista of the highest order, designing intricate geometric patterns for her curtains, dresses and even for batches of cupcakes she prepares for a local flea market. She even orders a guitar through the mail and is determined to fulfill her dream as a country artist like Patsy Cline or Tammy Wynette.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD--After Paterson agrees to copy all his poems at his wife's behest, his ""career"" as a poet is seemingly cut short after the film's true antagonist, Marvin the pit bull, chomps his ""secret notebook"" to pieces, before Paterson makes good on his promise to his wife. For the first time in the film, Laura becomes upset, and orders Marvin into the garage as punishment (Passive Paterson lets him back into the house). Nonetheless, Paterson resumes writing poetry at film's end and presumably Paterson's life of equilibrium has been re-established.You might appreciate some of the quirky characters here and certainly Farahani's performance, but the poet bus-driver protagonist--and his poetry--proves to be a major disappointment.",Paterson
22,jadavix,A divisive success,8,2 February 2017,"""Paterson"" has provoked a divided reaction among critics and filmgoers, and neither seem to be aware of the other's opinion. Most people seem to be reading the movie as a beautiful, uplifting story with a zen protagonist enjoying a simple, stress-free life.Some critics, however, have interpreted the film as a hymn to despair, a sad tale of a simple man being driven insane by the drudgery and hopelessness of his life.The problem is, this is a Jim Jarmusch movie. So who's to know which, if either, view is correct? The main character is typically inscrutable. His face betrays very little emotion and you can only guess at how he is feeling. The title is a trick: ""Paterson"" is also the name of the city the movie is set. All of this is true for the location as well, you see. The people we encounter are just as much enigmas as the title character is. Either they never really connect with Paterson (the man) or they do, and we don't realise it, because we haven't connected with Paterson either.You know the plot: Paterson is a bus driver who writes poetry in his spare time. He lives with an eccentric artist girlfriend whose dress patterns match the icing she puts on cupcakes. At nights he drinks in a bar where he encounters similarly lost, inexplicable individuals.The real star of the show is his girlfriend's bulldog, Marvin. Marvin hates Paterson, perhaps because he is a rival for his owner's affections. That's one relationship you can explain. ""Paterson"" asks a question of you: would you be happy in this world? Sure, there's poetry in everything, but you might never hear it, and if you could, you probably wouldn't understand it.Jarmusch has performed a balancing act: two interpretations, totally at odds with each other, both entrancing.",Paterson
23,st-shot,Paterson plods.,6,18 July 2017,"Paterson (Adam Driver) drives a public transit bus in Paterson, New Jersey. Like his route he is a creature of habit living out a drab existence with a fully engaged wife obsessed with monochromatic color scheme and an American bulldog Marvin who resents him. While Laura is an upbeat dreamer, Patterson is a withdrawn poet content to have a beer a night and a notebook to scribble thoughts and ideas in from his repetitive day to day experience that veers slightly off course at times.Chronicaler of American hum drum Jim Jarmusch offers up his usual askew compositions of the American scene which the city of Patterson readily delivers. Undertones of possible danger lurk around the periphery but never materialize though tragedy does find its way into the story from another angle.Drawing us in with the dead pan acting style that is found in most of Jarmusch's protagonists Adam Driver manages to infer much by saying little as he observes the world around him, finding inspiration, an ambiguous past only hinted at. Goldshifteh Farahani's Laura is a wispy space shot of warm sweetness while Marvin (Nellie) steals every scene as expected.For Jarmusch followers Paterson offers the same monotone passionless approach that Stranger than Paradise took cinema by storm in the mid 80s. A style that works within tighter margins of the emotional register it depends more on mood and setting to convey story as his non-descript great unwashed characters nonchalantly navigate their way through the everyday. Jarmusch's offbeat style has a knack of keeping monotony interesting in his work and here to a small degree he does so again but when the dog steals the picture from the auteur some re-grouping may be in order.",Paterson
24,arthur_tafero,Jim Jarmusch is the Best Screenwriter of the 21st Centruy - Paterson,9,18 October 2021,"This little independent film makes one thing perfectly clear; Jim Jarmusch is the best screenwriter of the 21st century. This film (and several others of his I have reviewed) are proof of that. This may be his masterpiece.Those of us who read and write poetry will appreciate this film far more than the average film viewer, and that is just fine. Just as Best in Show is special for dog owners, this film is special for poets. I was raised in Paterson, NJ, or to be more precise, West Paterson, which no longer exists, and is now Woodland Park (pretty name, same land and people). I went to school at Saint Bon's, which is no longer there (a public middle school is there), and lived in Great Notch Gardens (which is still there, but almost 90% of the woods are now gone in Woodland Park; which is fairly ironic, since we had all the woods in West Paterson). Driver does a great job; and I noticed does not say a negative thing about anyone or anything during the entire film. You could probably count on one hand the number of films in history that have protagonist that hever said even one bad thing about anything in a film (as in criticize). I know I can't go a day, or even a few hours without criticizing something. That is what makes this character so unique. He accepts life as it comes; a real example of philosophical Taoism. He is the center of the wheel. This film is not to be missed.",Paterson

29,framptonhollis,"a brilliant, beautiful film",10,11 February 2017,"Jim Jarmusch's latest masterpiece is not a film about plot, but rather about character and the miracles of mundane life. In theory, the concept of this gem is somewhat uninteresting. Who wants to see a week in the life of some random bus driver in Paterson? Well, Jarmusch beautifully showcases his talent for character and style as he makes the ordinary become extraordinary. This film observes little moments and reveals the magic and beauty hidden beneath them, revealing the poetic nature of the seemingly everyday. There are also many quirky little moments, slight and subtle details and jokes that pop out as surreal and fascinating. This is also a very stylish work, made with a poetic, rhythmic power and a damn cool soundtrack-just like the very best of Jarmusch's movies.There is also much humor to be found throughout the film. It's really a comedy more than anything, and it sure is a great one! Much of the humor is quite subtle and all due to timing and slight observations. Nobody ever spells out the joke for you, it is all told through visuals and implying dialogue, further proving that Jarmusch has now become a master of his craft.Did I mention that this movie is also just really, really likable?The characters are all well developed and likable, even if some are highly flawed. The overall nature and mood this film has is extremely pleasant, although there are some moments of conflict, in which Jarmusch manages to make the audience really care about things they otherwise wouldn't pay much attention to. I am very surprised that a film with so little plot or conflict did actually make me shed some tears, because this masterpiece forces you to become extremely attached to its pleasant and likable characters. Even if it is all just an observance of mundane life, all signs of conflict are about as tense as any climactic action sequence in a billion dollar blockbuster.",Paterson
30,bkrauser-81-311064,Robert Bresson by Way of Jim Jarmusch,7,31 January 2017,"Whether or not Paterson leaves an impression on you is almost beside the point. The movie, through its austere prose, deliberate cinematography and languishing pace has all the hallmarks of director Jim Jarmusch's other films. To the uninitiated it can feel rather insular; yet Paterson draws attention to itself precisely because it doesn't draw attention to itself. It stands like a plain segment of brick, waiting for you to paint your own feelings and experiences on top of it.Paterson surmises the week in the life of a quiet Paterson, New Jersey bus driver coincidentally named Paterson (Driver). In addition to quietly eavesdropping on the occupants of his quaint city bus, our protagonist spends his lunch hour sitting on a park bench silently writing poetry in his ""secret notebook"". His girlfriend Laura (Farahani) insists he makes copies of his work but Paterson's vacant look hides the fact he probably never will.His poetry randomly emerges in big block lettering as Paterson recites in the midst of deep thought. The film further captures Paterson's serenity juxtaposing his face with carefully composed frames of the everyday. ""I go through trillions of molecules, that move aside to make way for me. While on both sides, trillions more stay where they are."" The sights, the sounds, the words; all create a collage of pulchritude.Yet despite a veneer of sparse beauty, Paterson can't help but drive into certain narrative potholes. In the past, Jarmusch's ascetic style gelled with the quixotism of modern culture largely because his characters had some form of agency. If you were to compare Ghost Dog (1999) to Don in Broken Flowers (2005) you'd realize that the internal conflicts are brought about by external forces. This is not the case in Paterson. Paterson, listlessly wades through his life, tittering through the patterns and coincidences that surround him while assuming nothing. He's an empty vessel; a character who exemplifies the gentle drone of everyday existence. A canvass in which we see our own common foibles.Jarmusch seems to be pushing the knobs and turning the dials in Robert Bresson's old wheelhouse. That in itself wouldn't be a problem though, Bresson's clarity of thought always seemed to shine through his blank-slated characters and minimalist milieu. Jarmusch's style, as fastidious as it is has always struck me as a little too in it's own head. Ironic since Bresson was once dubbed the patron saint of cinema and Jarmusch seems to want the title of guru. Paterson especially, with visually implied spirituality and animism wants its audience to find deeper meanings in its pastiche form of zen.It's a tall order to appreciate the ineffable wisdom of everyday life in any capacity, let alone in a movie. And while Paterson succeeds in sections, the key interactions between Paterson and Laura leaves far too much unsaid. Laura is never given much of a life outside of their working-class bungalow. When not baking cupcakes for the weekend's farmer's market, Laura paints, stitches and strums on her guitar while Paterson silently indulges her whimsical fantasies.While some may deride their living situation as retrograde, the larger problem is a lack of basic humanity on Paterson's part. As written, our protagonist can't help but feel less like a person than a foreign force, interminably out of place in Laura's warmth. When Paterson says he's working on a poem for her, Laura responds, ""Is it a love poem?"" to which he responds ""It's written for you, so I guess that makes it a love poem."" His glibness is hardly the stuff of finding beauty in the minuscule.Yet as I said, this movie isn't too concerned about whether it leaves an impression. Like water it can either wash over you, you thinking nothing of it, or it can erode you to your very core. Liking Paterson arguably says more about you than it says about the film. In my opinion watching a guy working his bus route, scribbling in his notebook and harboring animus for his girlfriend's dog is hardly worth two hours and ten dollars.",Paterson
31,bandw,Triumph of the pedestrian,5,21 June 2017,"This follows a week in the life of a Paterson, New Jersey, bus driver, coincidentally named Paterson. One criterion that separates the best movies from the rest for me is whether I lose track of time while watching. That did not happen for me with this movie. One theme, a theme that is true for much of the time for a lot of our lives, is that every day is the same but every day is different. There was too much weight given to ""everyday is the same"" in this movie. Paterson writes poems and records his poems in a notebook. Given that poetry plays a central role in Patterson's life, it plays a central role in the movie. Unfortunately it did not capture my imagination, since Paterson's poetry was as pedestrian as his life. The poetry for the movie was written by New York poet Ron Padgett. The problem I have had with Padgett's poetry is that he takes a common everyday experience, writes a brief prose summary of the event, and calls it poetry. For example, consider the poem that begins:We have plenty of matches in our house.We keep them on hand always.Currently our favorite brand is Ohio Blue Tip,though we used to prefer Diamond brand.That was before we discovered Ohio Blue Tip matches.They are excellently packaged, sturdylittle boxes with dark and light blue and white labelswith words lettered in the shape of a megaphone,...If that stirs your soul, then you will be much more engaged with this movie than I was. I suppose that Padgett was a good choice for the role of putting the words on the screen, since they make it believable that Paterson, an ordinary person, could have written them.I appreciate the risk that Jarmusch is taking in making a movie like this. I just wish it had been more engaging. I did like the later scene that recounted a random meeting between Paterson and a Japanese poet whom he encounters on a public park bench. But the Japanese man intuits that Paterson is a poet? Really? Introducing the Japanese poet was only an artifice to help bring the story to a conclusion with the gift of the blank notebook.Given that a ""dog ate my homework"" scene is the emotional peak, be prepared for somewhat of a slog to get through this. It seems that an attempt was made to drain this of anything that might move it beyond the pedestrian: the camera work, the music, the acting, the color palette, the story--all pedestrian.",Paterson
32,proud_luddite,A unique and charming indie film,7,19 February 2018,"Paterson (Adam Driver) is a local bus driver in Paterson, New Jersey. The viewer witnesses a week in the life of Paterson including his domestic life with his common-law partner Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and their dog; his work-life; and his social life in the evenings as he visits a local bar. He also expresses his creative side writing poetry.The daily routine, especially the work days, have a similar pattern but they are never repetitious. Within the daily structure, there is always something new and different happening, The various characters are intriguing as well especially a hard-done-by co-worker and various dramas (some of them comical) that take place at the bar.Most amazing is a plot twist that happens near the end. To most, such an event would be an annoyance in daily domestic life yet here, its context leaves a very strong emotional impact.The directing by Jim Jarmusch is the movie's main strength as he pays such kind attention to the daily life of people that might be considered average. Paterson is a soft-spoken introvert and Laura is very tender-hearted though sometimes in a naive way. Driver and Farahani each do a great job in bringing these characters to life. Jarmusch adds to the movie's sweet charms by emphasizing the town's beautiful old buildings and its nearby serene waterfalls.A bonus, at least for folks like me: the main character refuses to own a mobile phone as he believes life was perfectly fine in the past without them. At least in fiction, it's nice to know there's someone else who feels this way.",Paterson
33,maurice_yacowar,New Jersey bus driver quietly enjoys writing and living poetry.,10,28 February 2017,"This film is too quiet and uneventful for the conventional film story. This film is a poem. It's a poem like what bus driver Paterson writes: quotidian images, simple and prosaic, that blossom into a wider but unspecified suggestion of meaning. In general parlance — the image is the light bulb, the poetry the light.The first poem we watch him write starts with the box of matches beside his breakfast Cheerios. The film teems with matches. The film starts with Laura saying she dreamt of having twins, one for each of them. When he leaves the house he sees two elderly twin men, another match. There are at least two sets of twin girls in the film and a couple of adult twin women. In another kind of match, two guys brag about possible conquests. Two lonely young anarchists are isolated in their idealism. All the little dramas of which Paterson catches snatches in his bus are such matches, individuals connecting. Or splitting, like the couple breaking up in the bar.Consider all the matches in the one-word title. Paterson is (i) the bus driver, (ii) his home town, (iii) his bus route, (iii) the epic poem by local hero William Carlos Williams, also set there. That poet is here aka Carlo William Carlos, a reversal of the original name, another form of twinning or match. The basic match is between the external and the interior life. As Williams explained his objective in his Paterson: ""the resemblance between the mind of modern man and the city."" The prosaic New Jersey of Paterson's world abounds with poetry. Outside a laundromat at night he encounters a rap song in the making, the washer thrumming out the rhythm. A carful of sinister blades produces another rap on dog-jacking. In his neighbourhood bar Paterson encounters the florid ""acting"" of rejected lover Everett. The bartender's angry wife conjugates ""chess tournament"" into the threat of ""chess tourniquet."" That's poetry.The characters also seem to work like figures of speech. We don't learn much about them, just enough to catch their present function. Bus driver Donnie lists a paragraph of the tribulations that define his life. We get a glimpse into the bartender's uneven marriage. The Japanese poetry-lover is a walking paean to poetry but a total enigma otherwise.Paterson's Laura is his muse, as another Laura was to Petrarch. But she's not the passive lady of the muse tradition. She is intensely committed to her black-and-white interior design and fashion theory. She respects Paterson's poetry and presciently urges him to make a second copy, for posterity. She craves her own fame and fortune as country singer and/or cupcake- maker. In her ambition and craving for recognition she's Paterson's antithesis. We don't see them having sex, but we do see their daily physical intimacy and love. That's the poetic face of the marriage. We don't know much more about Paterson either. The marine photo on his bedstead tells us he was a decorated hero. That explains his efficient take-down of the gun threat in the bar. But it deepens our sense of his life as a bus driver. He' s still a uniformed public servant but in a more normal, modest and social circumstance. The ribbons show he was a hero at war. The bar take-down attests to his courage and efficiency now. But he achieves a different kind of heroism in his life of transit poet. When he assumes the responsibility of staying with the young girl until her mother returns, he's the model citizen. His reward: the kindred spirit gives him the prize of a splendid little poem and shares his love of Emily Dickinson. When the loss of his poems might tempt him to abandon that impulse, his faith in his art and in himself is restored by the encounter with the Japanese Williams fan. That carrying on is also heroism. Then there's the dog. A lot of attention is spent upon Marvin (persuasively portrayed by Nellie). A dog is a dog is a dog. Until it isn't. For dognappers a prized English bulldog can mean fast big bucks. For a man it can be an excuse for a nightly walk and the opportunity to visit the bar. To a woman it can be the child substitute. To the director it can provide the cheap cuteness or sentiment for a cutaway from the characters, or a set-up for a possible dramatic plot-twist, that disturbs the viewer even if it doesn't happen.Marvin in particular is characterized as a living responsive presence in the family, growling at every physical exchange between his pets (aka masters). He's also very well trained and obedient, as when he stays sat and still at Paterson's demand. But that control proves severely limited. Marvin's daily routine, when he's on his own, is to run outside and knock-over the mailbox, which Paterson later has to straighten up. In his climactic rebellion Marvin destroys Paterson's only copy of his poems. So this dog embodies our hope or delusion of control over the indomitably uncontrollable. That's what poetry does too, give us a formal construction through which to explore and harness the uncontrollable facts and mysteries of life and fate. As prose narrows and defines our immediate environs, poetry opens out and unleashes the beyond. The poetry here has largely abandoned the strictures of rhyme, but it preserves the intensity and structure of rhythm and the constant eye for a wider meaning. The light beyond the bulb. Paterson is both an exaltation of poetry and — in its discovery amid prosaic material circumstance — its demystification. This is a joy to apprehend.",Paterson

How could it be bad with Adam Driver? But oh it was. Paterson is a bus driver that writes poetry. IMHO bad poetry. ""Our favorite brand of matches is Ohio Blue Tip, our previous favorite was diamond brand, blah - blah - blah."" They lost me after repeating the same poem multiple times.

35,rockman182,Paterson (2016),7,31 January 2017,"I haven't checked out many of Jim Jarmusch's work but I liked what I have seen so far. Coffee and Cigarettes especially, was an entertaining series of memorable segments featuring an ensemble cast. I hadn't researched much about Paterson outside of seeing the trailer in theaters. My preconception was that this film would be the perfect film for Adam Driver to showcase his acting talents and I think this prediction was proved right. Its another welcome addition to 2016 but I think it may be divisive among moviegoers.The film is about a bus driver named Paterson, who also shares a name with Paterson, New Jersey. He is a very structured man who sticks to his daily routines. He also is a talented poet, much of his work in poetry is sprawled physically on screen. My first impression is that this film wouldn't be for everyone and I stand by that thought. The film may feel slow inconsequential, and repetitive at many times. I'm certain that is exactly what Jarmusch was going for though. Paterson is a man who is set on a mundane, familiar schedule; a small change in routine or a small change in his world can through him off course. And it happens.I think Adam Driver was great. He plays the role of Paterson with a silent conviction and you can tell he's a different almost simple man. Paterson is observant and expressive. He's attentive to many common and specific things such as the conversations on his bus route, or even a box of matches. His wife Laura is his driving force and really influences him to pursue his passion. The relationship is hardly chaotic and really works. One could argue that there isn't much going on but I think there is in Paterson's world around him. Its an absorbing watch to see his interactions with the world and how they fuel his poetry.There aren't many issues to resolve in the film. Jarmusch goes to a familiar place where he sacrifices plot progression for a character study. I think its an enjoyable film. Its subtlety in humor really works and nothing really feels overstated. Paterson is a daring independent film that is not afraid to express itself in an uncharacteristic way. Jarmusch is experimental yet again but has a story to tell no matter how commonplace it seems to be.7.5/10",Paterson
36,juanmuscle,"Marvin, I don't like you right now...",10,4 March 2019,"Gosh Marvin is cute, golly Marvin could be kidnapped for these dogs are seemingly lucrative in Paterson Jersey! haha...I don't know, god this was eerie, the twin phenomenon never really came to ahead; yet it leaves that haunting eldritch quality looming over the tale as though we are one yet really we are two, one dimensional and sometimes poetic we are two dimensional owing to our creative side but really we are so much much more! That is the part that really resonates with all of us; we are so different and yet so close, we are so close for we are timeless and fathomless with endless dimensions teeming as it seethes out of our singular conscious into the collective unconscious.The score was so eerie and in this film one gets the sense that it, (the score) has a life of its own, it is an invisible character that desires to sally forth but instead of moving about in the streets it moves through people, making connections where it can here and now there strangely with an ethereal and softly nuanced continuity that is contiguous in and of itself outside of Patterson perhaps affecting others in Osaka as well.This tale is gorgeous I would highly recommend this; its subtle beauty grows with you harboring a titillating melancholia that gentle bears one into the seemingly real world but through different senses; as if one is searching searching for something more and its almost there, alluring one to an aesthetic contemplation but upon reaching our destination we are left notwithstanding, hollow and ready to embark on that sojourn which is universal in our terrifying human condition.",Paterson

However, this movie was an extreme slice-of-life one, as it's only about a guy who drives bus and write poems for a week.Nothing happened, like nothing. At the beginning, I was pretty on board with the film as it showed the life of the main guy pretty well. There were funny parts in his life. The most interesting aspect was him when he was driving on the bus. Each day, there's different people with different stories that he listened to.The story progressed with the main character writing poems, which seemed to reflect himself and his life. Since I didn't care much about poetry, especially modern poetry, the poems didn't really appeal to me. I also was pretty annoyed at the character's wife.Adam Driver played the main character, and he portrayed the emotion (if there is any) and the personality well.

38,Blue-Grotto,"Alluring, Charming, Unforgettable",10,22 October 2016,"From reflections in a puddle, cardinals singing, waterfalls, a harlequin guitar, shadows, designer cupcakes and more, the love of a creative and happy couple spills over the small town of Paterson, New Jersey. The ordinary becomes extraordinary. Paterson, who shares his name with the community at large, is a bus driver. The daily bus route takes him through the heart of town where Paterson overhears intriguing conversations, records observations in his notebook, generates poems and opens lunchbox surprises from his lovely and artistic wife, Laura. The couple's chemistry, expressed in kisses, constant conversation, cheer and trust, is remarkable. ""She understands me really well,"" says Paterson. Lucky guy. Lucky girl. The attractiveness, talent, color and charm of Laura and Paterson is infused in everything they do including Paterson's nightly tavern visits, the plain yet peculiar meals they have together, waking up in the morning and walking the dog.Even in all its outward simplicity, there is astonishing and wonderful depth to the film characters, scenes, themes and conversations. This artistic sensibility that is infused in everyday life, is something I loved so much about Japan and Paterson shows what this imaginative awareness looks like in small town North America. Truly there is inspiration and beauty everywhere. While the film delves into music, paintings and other mediums, its main artistic focus is on poetry. There are nods to the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and others. The poems Paterson comes up with in his jaunts around town are brilliant and beautiful. A box of Blue tip matches inspires, rather sparks, a love poem. A poem called Another One is about seeing other dimensions, which is what this incredible film encourages itself. Paterson is delightfully layered with surprising wisdom, complexity, diversity and humor at every turn. Twins make appearances every so often, for example, to remind us of one of the film themes; there is always someone out there like us that matches our hearts, and we are never really alone. Articles and images on a tavern wall take us to other dimensions in time in an instant. The on-screen chemistry between actors Adam Driver (Paterson) and Golshifteh Farahani (Laura) is critical to the film, and they are more than up to the task. They are outstanding, alluring and entirely convincing. The compassion and charm of this film is unforgettable. It reminds us that love and splendor spring from the unlikeliest of places.

39,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,To be or not to be,9,5 December 2016,"I really felt that although folks mostly agreed that the movie captured the ""poetry of everyday life"", there was much more to be had from the movie, which has its subtleties aplenty. Yes the ruins of Paterson are beautiful, yes the dappling of the light is fine, yes Laura and Paterson are a beautiful couple but go deeper!Most art that you initially create is going to be derivative. Paterson's poetry is essentially derivative of William Carlos Williams. You have to fight through this phase and find your own creations. So when Paterson's homework is eaten by the dog (remember to see the humour in this), I was mindful that the dog had done him a favour, because all of the early stuff is worthless, unless you happened to be called Rimbaud or Chatterton, and even then I imagine they burned a lot of doggerel before they wrote a good sentence. Derivation can be incredibly apparent in painting, for example Mondrian, where he dabbled with other folks' styles (impressionism, fauvism and even pointillism) before he arrived at his unique mature expression, for which he is famous (termed neoplasticism).Writing poetry is difficult, as so eloquently pointed out by WB Yeats:""We sat together at one summer's end,// That beautiful mild woman, your close friend, // And you and I, and talked of poetry.// I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;// Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought, // Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.// Better go down upon your marrow-bones // And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones // Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather; // For to articulate sweet sounds together// Is to work harder than all these""Paterson will need to break a lot of patterns and cobwebs if he wants to become a great poet.Many have looked at this portrait of a relationship and saw something sweet and tender. I'm sorry but I saw two disconnected individuals, a freeloading girlfriend, a boyfriend without a backbone, and a couple that didn't make decisions together. They're both good-looking tranquil people, but they're not soulmates. Laura tells Paterson that his poetry is great, but he needs challenge, not a sycophant, he needs someone who understands him, not someone who uses his wages to buy an expensive dog and gets him to walk it every evening! So when he recites a love poem, it's something false, it's a confection, it's what we want to hear but it's not true, and this is why he's still so far from greatness.The use of doubles in the movie is far from trivial, what it's saying is that there is a different lives Paterson (or any of us) could be leading, we have to make choices every day about which person we are going to be. The dissolve at the end when Paterson is lying in bed and seems to disappear momentarily is hinting that he might be best off disavowing his current life, he should be running a mile. Yet it's a comfortable life, and everyone likes comfy right? Two guys on the bus have a discussion where both recall recent encounters with women they liked and both had managed to fumble the ball through inaction, they chose, they don't live uncomfortable lives, but they chose not to live passionate lives. So that's why I chose the title for the review, because we all have to decide whether to embrace nonbeing, some sort of Taoist concept of naturalness, or whether we want to bristle our creativity, and streak like comets. Maybe the latter is innately egotistical. I think that the choice is what this movie is about, be humble or be brave. The movie is dualistic, no one interpretation is there to be forced on you. For me when he writes a poem about the song ""Swinging on a Star"" that's saying something key, he mentions that the only line he really plays again in his head is the one about being a fish, not being any of the others lives in the song. Again this is dualistic because it could be saying that he knows the life of a poet is for him, and it's the only one he thinks about, so he should embrace it, but if you read the full lyrics of the song, it talks about the fish who ""can't write his name or read a book"". Whereas another option ""Would you like to swing on a star // Carry moonbeams home in a jar // And be better off than you are"". Seems like the best though radical option that is open to Paterson, to change everything, but perhaps he won't take it.Ending on a more playful note, congratulations to Mr Jarmusch for yet again working a matchbox into proceedings!",Paterson

41,rajdoctor,Nonchalant Paterson Poetry,7,1 January 2018,"31 Dec 2017. If one looks back at 2017 - from top 10 grossing Hollywood movies 8 are super-heros, si-fi fantasy stuff. Amidst all that I saw a nonchalant film. ""Paterson"" (2016)Nothing actually happens in the movie. That is why it is a rare gem. It seems that the director Jim Jarmusch was carrying the idea of this film from last 20 years, and he was lucky it materialized.Though on the box office the movie is a disaster, it got critical acclaim on the approach and courage to venture into this stuff.The movie is about a bus driver named Paterson (Adam Driver - Star Wars fame), living in a small town of US called Paterson. He has a girl-friend Laura (extremely beautiful Golshifteh Farahani - Iranian) who is engaged in re-decorating the house interiors and also is ambitious with dreams of becoming a famous country singer and have her own pastry business. She has a dog Marvin which Paterson takes for a walk everyday evening when he goes to a bar for a drink.Paterson also has a passion for writing poetry - that slowly builds on him during the daily routine - which is quite regimental (understandably due to his timely job pressures as a bus driver)The movie is a reflection on the mundane life of a bus driver and the ups and down one encounters in daily life with different characters one interacts. The way Paterson is shown to take life as it comes, accepting everything that happens to him without much fuss is really admirable - especially when Laura's dog tears his only poetry book to shreds leaving him sad and solemn. In the end, an encounter with a Japanese tourist revives his passion to start re-writing poems.The movie is slow paced, so those of you who want, romance, action, comedy, si-fi, super-natural stuff are advised to be away. The poetry in itself is not great, but is inspiring to the sense that in mediocre life - one can be so fulfilled and at peace and happy as Paterson. The movie is a week's journey starts on a Monday and ends on on nonchalant note on another Monday.For some the direction and the proceeds of movie may seem uninspiring, but one needs to understand the mood and attempt to make something so out of the box and brave. Thanks Jim. That's why it leaves and impression.I would go with 7.5 out of 10",Paterson
42,Andres-Camara,You'll stay like the dog after the cake,2,15 June 2017,"You will gradually be flattened until you are completely bored. Turning the film around, I still do not know if what Jarmusch has done is a dramatic movie or if he has laughed at a lot of people. The poems (which I do not say do not have their audience), are completely anti poetry. The film does not count for anything and should last half an hour less. The first hour is all repetition of what you have already seen, you know his life, but he retells it several times. We have gone from putting repulsive and arrogant artists to putting artists who have nothing to tell or ambition to tell.The actors are very well if what you are looking for is to put unbearable characters, I do not care what they are engaged, is that as characters are unbearable. And at least the character of her does seek to show what he does, that for that is art, but his, does not look for anything in his life.Let's not say anything about photography. Why is photography almost always used, is it so white? He does not have a photograph, he does not count anything.The address is unbearable. It does not just bore everybody. Except for movie critics. In addition is that there is a pretty flat throughout the film. There is no staging.

43,rubenm,"Poetry, happiness and simplicity",7,12 December 2016,"It's not so easy to say what 'Paterson' is about. It's about a week in the life of a bus driver - that's the easy answer. A week in which not much happens, by the way. But it's also about poetry: the bus driver writes poems while waiting behind the wheel. It's about happiness: the film is drenched in it. And about simplicity: the bus driver's life is extremely simple. He wakes up at about quarter past six, kisses his sleeping wife, eats a cereal breakfast, walks to the bus garage, drives his bus, and returns home to the evening meal his wife has prepared for him.Jim Jarmusch shows this seven times: once for each day in the week. But there are slight differences: sometimes he wakes up at half pas six, his wife's position in bed is different each day (once she's not there because she got up before him), the talk at dinner depends on the events of the day. And small things happen every day: there's an incident at the local pub, the bus breaks down, his wife sells cupcakes at the farmer's market.When the average Hollywood blockbuster is a roller-coaster ride, this film is a quiet walk in the woods. Some people may find it boring. I didn't. 'Paterson' is a special film, because it has a very rare characteristic: it's not about anything in particular. Or is it about life itself?

44,MattBrady099,Paterson - Movie Review,9,4 November 2016,"LIFF30 2016 #1""Some call it rain"" Paterson is one of the most relatable, sweet, and charming movies I've seen this year. While the story is simply and straight forward on paper, but the final result is quite unique. Before seeing the movie, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie, even at Cannes it got excellent feedback. And boy, it didn't disappoint. Adam Driver once again knocks it out of the park in this movie. By giving a very quite and kindhearted performance that's quiet something. He's in everything recently and I'm glad an actor at he's range is getting the work he deserves. I would view this movie as kind of a character study. For example: Paterson main interest is poetry, as it is he's escapism, because he lives a simply life and usually dose the same routine everyday. He's a talented man that's stuck in a dull life. There's many times in the movie where he will be sitting at a bar (alone) and he will be watching other people and you can clearly see there's something going on in their lives. Or his friends would come up to him and talk about their day, which has a lot going compared to him. It brilliantly captures loneliness and the necessity of the main character. Even through he is married and has friends, he still feels isolated. Jim Jarmusch wrote and directed this movie so brilliantly that I can't imagine any other director doing this. What's so interesting about Jarmusch direction is that he focus more on mood and character development than anything else. And that's why I felt the main character isolation and futility. The strongest part of ""Paterson"" (putting aside the acting) is Jarmusch screenplay, as the film is heavy dialogue. The poetry in the movie is so well written and wasn't terribly force like other movies when trying to be poetic. Excellent work Jim Jarmusch. Haven't seen his other work yet, but will do soon day. Overall rating: ""Paterson"" is pure poetry in the most wonder way. I must admit, it left a big dumb smile on my face after it was over. The movie might be slow for some people and I can understand that, but there's something in this movie that I think everyone can appreciate.",Paterson
45,chaswe-28402,Memorably empty,10,1 June 2017,"This comedy is a very funny film, in every sense of the word funny. It would be wrong to say that nothing happens in it, but it is difficult to think of anything of any significance that happens. It is presumably inspired by William Carlos Williams, one of my least favourite poets, along with Ezra Pound. Williams grew up in Paterson. All else I know about him is that he wrote what purports to be a poem about a red wheelbarrow, a composition superbly parodied by Martin Gardner in 1983. Here, Paterson is the driver of a bus either called Paterson, or which drives to Paterson. At one point the bus breaks down, which is the most significant happening in the film. Paterson is also painted on a wall, and Paterson owns a book titled Paterson by William Carlos Williams. Several pairs of identical twins are in this film; young, old, male, female. Why not ? Then again, why ? Paterson's nice wife is into black and white stripes and circles. The bad guy in this film is a dog called Marvin, played by a dog called Nellie. It is a female dog. Marvin is more naughty than bad, but she died two weeks after the film was finished. Marvin had chewed up Paterson's poems. This film reminded me of another, called Eraserhead. I saw Eraserhead in a cinema with an audience of about ten. After 20 minutes one of them got up and walked out. I saw Paterson in a cinema with about six others, and after 25 minutes one of them got up and walked out. That was the similarity. For some inexplicable reason, although I dislike Williams the poet, I thought this film was very good, memorable and interesting. I find it difficult to stop thinking about it, and wondering about it, and what it is about, if anything. It made me laugh.After watching this film again, I understand that there was another incident of would-be significance that I had completely forgotten. This was when a rejected lover pulled a toy gun and threatened to shoot either himself, or the girl who didn't want him. Bravely tackled by Paterson, he was thrown on the floor, and the gun was shown to be harmless. I must have thought this scene was insignificant or unconvincing when I first saw it. A Japanese man gave Paterson a blank Japanese notebook for writing poems in. Early on in the film I think Paterson has a female double riding in the bus.

46,CineMuseFilms,A whimsical essay into the ordinariness of human existence,7,29 December 2016,"Jim Jarmusch films can be challenging and Paterson (2016) is no  exception. Audiences who are accustomed to plot or character-driven  stories will find themselves grappling instead with a mood in search of  a reason. Without a genre label to help, we must work through an  exploratory essay into the ordinariness of human existence elevated  occasionally by the creative impulse to write poetry. If it sounds  cerebral, then it's a Jarmusch film. Paterson (Adam Driver) is a bus  driver in Paterson, USA. If that sounds odd, then it matches this  whimsical story based on the typical week of a nondescript transport  worker who lives not a life but a routine. His unchanging beige  existence is in bold relief to his beautiful Iranian-born wife Laura  (Golshifteh Farahani) who is artistically creative and continually  reshaping her goals. Their lovable and irascible bulldog Marvin is the  story's primary source of humour. Paterson drifts into writing poems  throughout his day, composing lines in his head, and sometimes his  silken words appear as on-screen text framed by banality like an urban  bus window. His free-flowing verses are a contrast to his symmetrical  and ordered life. While Laura thinks they should be shared with the  world, he is bashful about them because the sentences do not rhyme. The  pattern of his days is always the same, punctuated by what happens to  others rather than what happens to him. Quirky characters create  capsule sketches that represent the mundanity of living: a woe-riddled  supervisor, a broken romance, a curious Japanese tourist, overheard  passenger conversations, and a broken down bus  all part of a quiet  existential stream notable only for its inconsequence. Narrative  turning points work like signposts that tell us that something  significant is about to occur in a story, but there are none here. Each  time it appears possible that the story might progress in some  interesting new direction nothing happens, perhaps to reflect how  Paterson lives his life. There are layers of unreality across many  scenes and the dialogue often feels as if it is being delivered at a  script reading: clear diction, perfect rhythm, without emotion. This  slight air of inauthenticity forms a backdrop for the sincerity and  lyricism present in Paterson's poetry. It may or may not be good  poetry; that is not the point. It is about contrasting layers of  reality and they are evident elsewhere, always with the same effect.  When a small girl who also writes poetry says ""Cool. My bus driver is a  poet"" we feel like responding: ""well, why not?""; creativity hides  everywhere. Not everyone will stay with this film because of its  minimalist pace, deadpan humour, prolonged silences, understated acting  and noticeably sparse music to lift the emotional tone. It is devoid of  regular cinematic artifice and feels like we have momentarily glimpsed  into the inner space of a true gentle soul and can walk away the better  for it.

There's not much excitement here as not much happens in the week we're with them, but the three principals are exquisitely suited to worm their way into your mind in such a way that they'll seem like close friends after it's all over. That's quite a trick.Paterson's a city bus driver, his wife, Laura, is an accomplished goofball, and their dog, Marvin, is an English bulldog with a sense of humor. Almost the entire plot has to do with Paterson's love of poetry, but I was rather taken with his wife's charming personality. It's almost a perfect match with Paterson's positive, live and let live, attitude. Together you wonder whether such people might live for real, all across the country.It might all amount to a pleasant but not very impressive night at the movies. Ordinarily, I'd agree, but why then do I smile whenever I think of the principals? Clearly there's been something magical at work.",Paterson
48,gsygsy,A great movie by a great filmmaker at the top of his game.,10,21 January 2017,"PATERSON is the best Jim Jarmusch movie for years, possibly his best ever. To his admirers, it will come as a welcome relief after the dreariness of his previous film, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE.The eponymous Paterson is, at the same time, a laconic bus driver, the New Jersey city through which he steers his bus, and the epic poem by William Carlos Williams set in the city. By the simple, brilliant expedient of making his bus driver a poet, Jarmusch delivers a kind of continuous triple-exposure: all three Patersons are on the go throughout the film. This enables apparently random episodes, such as conversations which Paterson the driver eavesdrops upon while driving his route, to be integrated perfectly into the structure of the film. Everything feels connected in a remarkable way.That this never comes over as an intellectual idea, but instead as a story full of humanity and compassion, is largely down to the casting of Adam Driver as - yes, probably another wry Jarmusch gag - the driver. Observant, thoughtful, loving, tender, but also strong and capable of decisive action in what appears to be an emergency, Driver's gives a performance that is both a contradiction of what we think of as acting and its apotheosis. It's completely brilliant, beyond mere praise. There isn't an award for something like this, but if there were, Driver would walk away with it.The supporting cast are all fine and dandy, notably Golshifteh Farahani as Paterson's lover, and the late, great Nellie as her bulldog.The film is mercifully free from conventional plotting. When a little moment of it pops up, you can see the turn of events coming quite a way off, but it's hardly a flaw.There's no way this can not be worthy of 10 out of 10, because it's a great movie by a great filmmaker at the top of his game.",Paterson

He seems to enjoy his job on some level, and uses it to fuel his passion for observation through poetry. He always carries around a notebook where he writes down the poems he thinks of as the goes about his day. His girlfriend is gorgeous, slightly naive and super loyal. She is visually talented, and loves to bake. They even got a funny dog. He is a regular at a local bar with interesting chess-playing regulars that seem to always provide him with a story, or something to take back home with him. One day, there's an event in the bar that makes the poet a hero.This is not a peer into someone's imagination, this is someone's fantasy. The day dreams you have as you go to sleep. It feels almost a bit too intimate.At the same time, who doesn't want a life like this? The movie is like escapism for intellectuals. The modern day high cultured man does not dream of exploring the jungles of Africa or shooting aliens with electric rifles, but to be the everyday hero with the beautiful dedicated girl and the funny dog.That said, I did like this movie. I love the structure of it, showing the same moments every day. I love how it makes poetry accessible for everyone, something down-to-earth. The beautiful society it shows is beautiful, even though I have a hard time believing in it. The movie does something interesting in the way it hints at conflict, and... well, I won't spoil what happens. But I think it's a nice touch. There's also some imagery that goes through the entire film, without really being explored. I didn't mind this.",Paterson

52,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,2 January 2017,"Paterson (Adam Driver) is a bus driver in, coincidentally, Paterson, New Jersey. He lives in a humble home with his girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and they are happily in love with each other and their dog. Paterson also happens to write poetry routinely as he goes around town in his bus and experiences everyday life.As anyone who has heard of this film you will probably know that there is no hook in the synopsis, no inciting incident, ""Paterson"" is a film that looks at routine and ordinariness and succeeds in that is is a, fittingly, poetic look at the joys of simplicity and tranquility and a wonderfully absorbing filmmaking effort that is most unlikely to any other film I've seen this year.Having been a big, big critic of Adam Driver in the past, more so because I thought he was constantly miscast I was so pleasantly surprised by a performance of him that I could finally appreciate and what a performance to start with. A lot of this film's success lies in his hands, I can only imagine what an effort it must have taken Jarmusch to direct him in the perfect way, to put into words what ultimately he envisioned on screen. Yet, the effort must have been worth it because Driver comes out utterly convincing. This is a performance of nuances, of little details, of eyes wandering in one direction rather than the other and of postures, he covers it all and becomes this quirky character, he sells the idea of an every-man perfectly and because of that it makes the film as relatable as it is.His co-star, Golshifteh Farahani, walks the same line just as finely. Her character is very extrovert, a perfect opposite of what Driver is, and she plays off him magnificently. It could be very easy for her to become a stereotype, a cliché and an annoying presence in the film, she has all the ingredients to be so, but by playing the part so genuinely and lovingly we get a character that is sweet and convincing just as she should be. There is no big twist for her, nothing going on underneath that should be a big mystery, she is just an affectionate character and I loved to see her come to play and interact with the equally loving, yet more introvert Paterson. Their relationship felt incredibly genuine and raw in a way that few films have ever captured and serves as a perfect companion piece to something like ""The Before Trilogy"" which looks at relationships in a completely different way, but emerges with the same genuine emotion on screen.Jarmusch keeps things simple behind the camera as it should be: the shots are simple, they don't call attention to themselves and the camera movement is minimal, even though when it actually starts moving there is always a reason for it, this is one of the best examples of charging camera movement with emotion. It is in the little details that one could loose hours researching and reflecting upon and that is exactly the function of the poetry in the film, which talks about small things but it charges them with significance and thematic power. You are constantly fascinated by the world portrayed on screen and it is thanks to a brilliant puzzle of editing, cinematography sound and performance that manages to capture a simple world and fill it with meaning and evolve only slightly through the film making you fascinated by every word uttered and every frame displayed.I think that where the film stumbles is in its closing. It looked like it felt the need to give some kind of closure to the characters and not leave them as ordinarily as we found them and it felt a little too artificial when comparing it with the rest of the film. Paterson has some encounters which I didn't really buy into as they felt way too heavy on significance. Yet, the most problematic element in my opinion is the fact that I could have easily envisioned this film ending without any of these scenes and just by keeping the rhythm it had had up until then. I actually think that by going this way, Jarmusch partially deprived the film of the magic it was building with the beauty in everyday life, the message that ultimately gets conveyed didn't necessitate those symbolical scenes in my view.""Paterson"" is a wonderful experience, it fills your heart up with joy and tranquility, the poetic nature of the film is a stroke of genius and makes what is possibly the most bland premise of all time a riveting two hour watch that moved me deeply and made me reflect upon a wide range of themes.",Paterson
53,jamiedarlow-37510,'I have eaten the plums that were sitting in the ice box. Which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me. They were delicious.',10,7 April 2020,"Probably now my favourite Jim Jarmusch film due to its overwhelming sweetness, kindness and romantic theme! Paterson follows Paterson (Adam Driver) who lives in the town of Paterson; a bus driver by trade and lives with the love of his life Laura (Golshifteh Farahani). We are shown a week in the life of this couple and the inspiration in which Paterson finds for his poetry. This film had an incredibly calming effect on me; I just found its outlook on life to be so lovely and felt huge reassurance through the characters overcoming of certain obstacles. The performances are quite perfect, its funny and heartfelt, it's shot beautifully and is directed with a sumptuous lyrical flow akin to Paterson's poetry. There's nothing particularly dramatic in the film and that's what makes it so relatable and down to earth; it really is a week in the life of a human being and is very much about the beauty in our daily routine and the details",Paterson
54,jayjaycee,Adam (Bus) Driver: A heartwarming poem!,8,2 December 2019,"""Paterson"" is a 2016 drama directed by Jim Jarmusch starring Adam Driver and Golshifteh Farahani. Now that the holiday season has begun and the feeling of contemplation starts to set in, I thought it's time to get to some quiet dramas and initially thought of this film. It's my first Jarmusch production, to be honest, I've only heard about his style, but never experienced it myself. At the forehand, I read a lot about this one and it made me curious just by its storyline. I'm a passionate poet myself and that's why it had my attention immediately - and I'm glad that I gave it a watch. In the beginning, it took some time to develop its perfect pace, as its narrative structure was somewhat monotonous and distanced, but as the movie progressed I finally began to figure out the distinctive style of JJ: It lives from its minimalistic score and plain dialogue and laconic characters. The story combines so many fascinating aspects, it's hesitantly melancholic and at times subtly comedic, but never loses its serious tone. Furthermore, the story deals with several emotional themes and Jarmusch managed to depict them in a metaphoric and artistic manner. It contrasts the perception of dreams and reality, obviously symbolised by the prominent play of colours with black and white and generally creates powerful impressions by the resulting imagery. At times the plot seems repetitive and boring, but it's a stylistic device to underline the monotony of Paterson's daily routine. Next to an ingenious ""Moonrise Kingdom"" reunion we get several small scenes that all live from their love for detail, in a pace that's as sleepy as poetic, perfectly underlining the overall symbolism. One of the best aspects of the film though are the performances of the protagonist couple. The give their excellently written characters so much depth and as quirky as they are, they share such an enormously genuine chemistry and wonderful love. They have so many differences, but also so many shared interests. One is an old-fashioned and quiet small town poet and the other is an extrovert and modern dreamer. It's what makes them so tremendously loveable. They both have conflicts to struggle with, but support each other unconditionally. All in all, this beautiful drama is one of the quieter ones, it took some time to unfold its ingeniousness, but as it finally was on the right level, it delivers a powerful and touching story, with unique characters, breathtaking poetry and a imaginative plot that makes your heart melt at times. It's not overall sad, it's a study that worships the ups and downs of life with subtle melancholy and heartwarming positivity. It's a gem, least to say, that should be more recognised. It even shows that Adam Driver is more than a franchise actor. In this one, he proved to me that he's the potential to be much more.",Paterson
55,x_manicure_x,A mediocre life,7,14 August 2021,"""Paterson"" is a simple and uneventful slice-of-life piece that follows a week in a bus driver's life and at the same time shows that art and beauty lie in the simplest things. The film makes no statement and just shows the days repeating themselves monotonously, yet you can't help feeling the warmth and lyricism of the images and sounds. Life might be pointless, maybe you won't even find the right person or job for you, but art and expression can help you go through it. It doesn't even matter if you are good at it.The poems could be better, the running time could be a little shorter, but it worked perfectly as a healing film on a bad night.",Paterson
56,kaptenvideo-89875,I wanna live like common people...,9,23 January 2017,"Paterson is the name of the city where the main character (Adam Driver) lives, and also his name. He is a man of constant simple routine: works as a bus driver, writes poetry to his secret note book, goes home to his beloved wife, eats dinner with her, takes her dog for a walk and goes to have a beer at the same bar every night. That's it.The legendary writer-director Jim Jarmusch only releases a new movie after every 2-4 years but when it happens, it's always worth the wait. Yes, his unique style of storytelling is boring and frankly incomprehensible to those equating cinema – especially American – with quick thrills. But if you happen to be able to stay on the same page with him, you will be happy to spend two hours watching how seemingly nothing or little happens story-wise.Jarmusch is all about details and how little things make bigger things meaningful – both in life and on screen. One can't just watch his movie, it would probably become boring long before the end. You need this specific meditative mood, be ready to delve into what's presented and forget the real time in your real world. Jarmusch's stories are slooooooow, they are not so much about specific events and dialogue than the lead characters' state of mind or chosen way of being, which is often illustrated by recurring events and details. In this context, some of his projects are easier"", such as Paterson"", and some one you wouldn't really imagine yourself watching twice, even if you liked it, such as 2009's The Limits of Control"".Having called Paterson"" one of Jarmusch's easier"" movies doesn't mean that it's mainstream-friendly. It's still very much a slow, meditative experience where little happens, basically the main event is shown multiple times with little variations, there's not much dialogue or many different characters. Also, I did not symphatize with Paterson's unconditional admiration for her wife. And I loved the movie! Goes to my personal best of 2016"" list for sure.So, how did Jarmusch take a story about almost nothing and make it one of the best-reviewed American movies of last year? Like stated above, the god is in the details. Jarmusch's style of presenting everything – creating mise en scène to put it in technical terms – is so captivating, efficient and powerful that I can't couldn't help but watch with interest from the very first seconds. Every little thing can be interesting or, for example, funny, just because how Jarmusch has decided to show it. And nothing on screen is meaningless or trivial. He is not the only famous American director with a penchant of concentrating on fascinating details instead of extensive story and dialogue – Wes Anderson is pretty popular, too – but he sure is one of the great masters of it. And somehow it works for creating and maintaining suspense through long two hour movie (OK, for this, the music is used efficiently too). If you like Paterson"", you like it just because how it feels. It's not flashy in any way, and there are no big Oscar moments"". The result is very much like life itself: it has a deeper spiritual message but one that is not carried to you on a silver platter. If you choose not to uncover or recognize it, you will not get it. And there's nothing wrong with not getting it either. You get it when you're ready. If not, then you're not ready, and hearing about it wouldn't help you. (The hint is in the beginning of this review, by the way.)The actors are part of the puzzle, not meant to stand out specifically. But the performances are good and Adam Driver as Paterson is a rising star for sure. I love him from HBO's Girls"" already and am happy to see him now having leading roles in movies also. He's also Kylo in the new Star Wars"" trilogy if somebody cares about that.",Paterson
57,Miles-10,"A Gentle, Satisfying Slice of Life",9,15 September 2017,"A week in the life of a young bus driver-poet named Paterson, who lives in Paterson, New Jersey (director Jim Jarmusch must enjoy this conceit), is the focus of this gentle drama. While it begins slowly, things do happen, and, ultimately, it all pays off. Everything about the movie is gentle, from the humor to the little bit of violence. (I know that might seem unlikely.) Jarmusch telegraphs a lot of the plot points, but at least there is a plot to anticipate. For examples, I knew that Everett was going to do something crazy before he did it. (Hasn't Paterson just asked Marie whether or not Everett might do something crazy?) And I knew that Marvin was going to do something crazy, too, before he did it. (Hasn't the camera shown the glint in Marvin's eye before Paterson and his lovely wife, Laura, go out to dinner and a movie? And hasn't Laura spent much of the movie warning Paterson to take precautions?)Paterson, played by Adam Driver, is a mild-mannered guy. His routine could be described as dull. It is almost the same every weekday, but the nature of life is that at least one interesting occurrence is bound to break up the daily routine, and that happens here. A nice touch is the series of overheard conversations among bus patrons. A brief conversation can tell a lot about people. And a recurring gag is that after Laura tells Paterson that she dreamed about having twins (the young couple is childless), Paterson keeps seeing twins of various ages throughout the rest of the movie.Paterson wakes up every day, kisses Laura, eats breakfast, walks to work, drives his route, writes poems in his notebook, then goes home. Every evening, he finds his mailbox post leaning, and he straightens it up. The next evening he repeats this ritual. (Finally, we find out what has been making the box lean over.)After dinner, Paterson always takes his dog for a walk, but this is really an excuse to go to the local watering hole where he knows Doc, the bartender. Doc has a wall dedicated to famous people from Paterson, including the twentieth century comedian Lou Costello, whom Doc and Paterson agree is probably the most famous of the many famous Patersonians.""I wonder where his partner, Bud Abbott, was from?"" muses Paterson.""He was from New Jersey, too,"" replies Doc. ""Ashbury Park. Born 1895.""Doc seems to know everything. He is also looking forward to a chess tournament over the weekend.""I'm getting my ass kicked,"" Doc says as he moves a chess piece on a board sitting on the bar.""Who are you playing?"" asks Paterson after a look around. ""Myself,"" says Doc.Few movies are made about poets, especially not about the undiscovered ones. Paterson narrates little poems on his way to work, and he writes them in his notebook, before he starts his bus and on his lunch break. (Jarmush got real-life poet Ron Padgett to provide all but one of the poems used in the movie; Jarmusch himself wrote the poem, ""Water Falls"".) Paterson also writes at a bench in his basement. His books, lined up on the bench, show his taste in poetry. Wallace Stevens and, of course, William Carlos Williams, a Paterson resident. These poets have something in common with Paterson in that they, too, had day jobs. Stevens was an insurance executive, and Williams was a medical doctor. Paterson also has a slim volume by Ron Padgett.Paterson adores Laura and supports her, even though he may not fully understand all of her eccentric ideas. She is always painting things black and white, including walls, curtains and clothing. (Paterson checks to make sure the paint is dry.) She wants to buy an expensive guitar (a black and white Harlequin, natch) and dreams of becoming a Nashville star. She also thinks she could parlay her baking skills into a cupcake business. She creates a brussel sprout and cheddar cheese pie for dinner. Paterson may have his doubts about some of these things (I think he is less than thrilled about the expensive guitar), but he is supportive in all cases, just as Laura supports his poetry. He also always asks workmates and strangers how they are and seems to be genuinely interested. He looks out for a ten-year- old who has been left alone, and he seems unafraid when a gang- banger questions him on the street. A photo in his home appears to be of him in a U.S. Marine uniform, but nothing is ever said about this. One suspects that that might represent the only time he ever left Paterson.Although it seems as if nothing is happening at first, things do, and, if you give this movie a chance, you might be rewarded.",Paterson
58,peeedeee-94281,Putters-on,1,9 June 2019,"How is it that a town, a guy and his bus route, are all named Paterson? I guess that was the comedy part of the movie. Romance? Hah, so they sleep half naked together, I didn't sense any emotional connection between Paterson and his wife.
This movie is part of that genre or style of film where making a movie about someone's mundane, repetitive life, is considered artsy and hip. Seriously, we go to movies to be entertained, not to watch our own boring lives portrayed on screen. I tried to get through this film, but stopped about half way. If you haven't grabbed my attention by then, your movie isn't worth completing. I don't want to lose 2 hours of my life for a movie that repeats the same scenes over and over again. I was hoping Paterson would turn into Travis Bickle, but no, he just eavesdrops on passenger conversations, then writes 'poetry' when he gets home, which really isn't poetic, it's just him writing in prose about his day or things he sees.
Many of the positive reviews here call this movie 'poetry'. I don't think they knew what to make of it, but because its Jaramusch, they have to assume he was going for a poetic movie. More like dullsville, as Paterson putters on his dull life.",Paterson
59,hrkepler,Cinematic Poem About Poetry,9,8 June 2018,"'Paterson' is a movie about bus driver and (secret) poet named Paterson who lives in a city Paterson and whose favorite poet is William Carlos Williams from Paterson who wrote poem about Paterson.It is slow and subtle movie with not much seemingly going on, like our everyday lives. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought the film is nice poem about simplicity of our everyday life. Maybe the slow is not the correct use of words to describe the film - it's quiet but it has nice flow. The two hours running time doesn't seem like two, or even three hours. The film begins (with Monday) and ends (with Sunday) without noticing like the weeks in real life. But with enough memorable moments and events to feel that the time was spent wisely. 'Paterson' never drags, it offers quite many surprises (some can even see them as twists) and nice typical Jarmusch warm and quirky humor.Adam Driver (bus driver) does a fantastic job, and so does the rest of the cast. All the main characters are quirky and pleasant. To me there were no unpleasant characters in the film.It's hard to say if 'Paterson' is Jim Jarmusch's best film (it's hard to choose when ones filmography is primarily filled with masterpieces), but it is definitely a masterful film.",Paterson
60,tigerfish50,Life as a Poem,8,19 April 2017,"'Paterson' doesn't have a complicated plot - it simply observes a week in the work and leisure time of a NJ bus driver called Paterson who lives in the town of Paterson and writes poems as a hobby. Paterson's daily routine has few variations - he rises early, eats breakfast and walks through sunny streets to the bus garage. During the day he drives around the city, listening to passengers' exchanges, before returning home. After eating dinner with his wife Laura, he walks her dog to a local bar and engages in low-key conversations with the owner and other patrons. Much of the credit for the film's success goes to the two lead actors, who portray a contrasting couple in a sweetly balanced relationship. Laura provides the love and magic in Paterson's life with her quirky passions for black-and-white interior design, cupcakes, music and his poetry. In return, he supplies patience, support and devotion. The minimalist narrative has the flavor of a Zen-like visual poem, an impression which is confirmed by Paterson's encounter with a Japanese poet near the end. The film reflects a tendency in contemporary poetry to focus on mundane details, which accumulate to produce an artful tapestry. Somehow these basic ingredients result in a satisfying flavorful dish.",Paterson
61,Semisonic,Like watching water fall,8,25 March 2017,"Water falls from the bright air. At first it's just water, nothing out of ordinary. And Paterson starts out just as an everyday life of an ordinary person, a small drowsy man in a small drowsy town. Things float by smoothly and softly, and you could almost hear the metronome ticking.But then you start losing yourself and falling into a trance. You start seeing things, and catching thoughts, like flies woken up by the warm spring sun. Thoughts about life, and how different it is for different people, and how our life paths go different ways and how sometimes you lead the way and sometimes you just have to follow. Even if you wanted to catch all of those flies and put them in one big straight line, you'd fail, and they'd fly away uncategorized. Don't try to analyze, just let yourself flow along.And then the stream gets more rough, unwilling to stay forever on a leash. And you realize that the water of your life, however repeating itself from day to day, is still not the same. That things do happen that may bring major change, like the rivers change their course when their nature's ready for it. And yet again, you might fight the flow or let it carry you on. Both options are feasible, leaving your future path open.But eventually, even the troubled water calms down. And no matter what shore you found yourself on, you can see the stars reflect on the surface, and trace your way onwards again. Or just sit and contemplate the water fall on its own.Paterson is really a meditative experience. I wouldn't call it thought-provoking though, since it doesn't give you much ground for analysis. What it does give, however, is a certain calm and an invitation to reflect on your own life and just let yourself perceive through feelings some aspects that you might have been ignoring, incidentally or on purpose, in that busy everyday life of yours. To look at things slightly from above, with no hurry or pressure. What you see from there, and what you do with what you see, is up to you though. But no matter what, the sun still rises every morning and sets every evening. That's the only metronome out there going steady, but at least that one had never let you down. At least so far.",Paterson
62,spencergrande6,The beauty in the routine of everyday life,8,24 February 2017,"The beauty in the routine of everyday life. The most Japanese American movie ever made. Paterson is shaped like a poem, with its repeating structure of slight everyday variation, and suggests that, maybe, if we stopped to think about it once in a while, we could see the beauty in most things. Everything isn't poetry until we stop to see it as such, to think about it as such, to express it as such.This is the most pleasant of films, filled with likable characters and pleasing conversation. You don't really want it to end, much like life, and it's not always the most thrilling -- except when it is, sometimes at the most inopportune of times -- much like life. Paterson and Laura have a perfectly dichotomous relationship -- representing the need for balance, for helping to see the world from a different point of view -- with Driver and Farahani having nice chemistry.Paterson doesn't care if his (or its) poetry is any good. What matters is the strive for it and the need for it. Poetry doesn't have to be elitist, dense, high-brow, etc. It can be what you make of it. Maybe that's too simplistic, but this is just the one point of view, of many.",Paterson
63,SpoilerAlertReviews,A poetic pro of people watching.,8,27 November 2016,"Jim Jarmusch could almost be mistaken for being an European director coupled with his name and style of film making. Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai being a personal favourite of his work. I was looking forward to seeing this, a film that's been on the boil for almost twenty years. It's actually difficult to get excited about seeing this film because the plot is about a bus driver/secret poet named Paterson who was born and bred, resides and works in the city of Paterson, New Jersey. Spending the week, witnessing his daily routine from breakfast cereal to the nightly tipple at the local bar. Sounds mundane right? But this is a Jarmusch movie, so one can expect interesting, yet realistic characters with some light touches of comedy. Adam Driver plays Paterson brilliantly, portraying a kind, gently soul who plods through life one day at a time with urges to write his poetry when the opportunity arises. Concerning and polite, you can tell he's quite the dreamer but instead distracted by what happens around him in real- life. A true pro and people-watching eavesdropping conversations of everyday passengers who board his bus. Golshifteh Farahani plays Laura, Paterson's girlfriend who's obsessed with anything and everything black and white, weaving it into her incredible drive for creativity; painting everything, dressmaking and cupcake cooking. The couple who appeared not necessarily opposites, but an unlikely matches actually centers around understanding one another, accommodating and encourage each other's creativeness. We meet the strange, interesting characters that populate anyone's life that are only noticed when one cares to look and listen about. Sitting at a bar, alone, after a long day can give you a front seat row to the happenings about you as they flit in and out of the bar, on and off the bus during the whole story. It's superbly shot, using much of the city and clever reflective shots throughout. Something you can expect from Jarmusch. While silence or conversation make up most of the film, Carter Logan does a lovely, soft score that's more like a whispering wind during times of contemplation. It's not going to be everyone's typical fare, as it's purposefully slow paced, but it's inspired me to dig out my poems of old and maybe even put a pen to paper again. It's a charming, light- hearted story of everyday life through the eyes of a poet, that happens to be a bus driver.

Through interesting overhead shots and soft bounced lighting, we see everyday life through a change of perspective and through the eyes of the titular man who fittingly shares a name with the city in which he resides.

65,crculver,Attempts to capture the microsm of one ordinary man's life over a week - and his remarkable marriage,6,21 July 2018,"Jim Jarmusch's 2016 film PATERSON is a study of everyday life in a small American city. Its title refers on one hand to its setting of Paterson, New Jersey, much less known abroad than other towns in the state but a surprising number of prominent Americans hailed from there and it was eulogized in an epic-length work by the poet William Carlos Williams. On the other hand, Paterson is coincidentally the last name of our protagonist, a thirty-something bus driver played by Adam Driver.The film is a day-by-day account of one week in Paterson's life and in fact each day is rather the same: Paterson wakes up, kisses his wife (played by Golshifteh Farahani), goes to work driving the bus, comes home, eats dinner with his wife, takes the dog for a walk, and has a beer at the local bar. Yet Paterson also has an unusual hobby: for some time he has written poetry during each day's lunch break, and he has filled a small notebook with poems that his wife calls wonderful, but which he has never shown to anyone else.There is a plot to Paterson, that is, an increasing of tension and a sudden and jarring climax, but overall Jarmusch is not aiming for any grand and intricate storytelling here. Instead, he is intentionally trying to capture the quiet music of one ordinary person's existence. Or should I say, two ordinary people's existence, for the film sympathetically captures this couple's marriage. Their relationship is a simple, uncomplicated one of trust and mutual understanding. Paterson is extremely fortunate to have this, as events around him show. (The script is by Sara Driver, Jarmusch's partner of decades, and one might see the film as a hymn to their own special relationship.) Many viewers are likely to find this heartwarming, while other viewers in more fraught marriages might burn with jealousy at Paterson and his wife's incredible harmony.Those familiar with Jarmusch's earlier work know that he has always liked to show a great deal of urban blight before the camera, such as vacant lots overgrown with weeds and graffitied walls. For Jarmusch, these backdrops supposedly served as a counterweight to the typical Hollywood depictions of the USA as all glitz, and it helped to underscore the bohemian qualities of his characters. Yet this blight surprisingly absent here. Paterson, New Jersey is instead shown as a clean and fairly prosperous town. Its residents, regardless of socioeconomic status or race, are depicted as rather content people.In fact, at regular points in the film Jarmusch depicts interactions between whites and African-Americans or between gays and straights as if celebrating our new modern era when all those old divisions don't matter any more. This is definitely the most optimistic film that Jarmusch has ever shot, but this utopian vision does come across as a little heavy-handed and one feels that Jarmusch is overlooking pressing social issues that continue to hold many people back. Watching this film, I couldn't help but protest that this gentrified setting is not all of America, just a privileged few. Still, in spite of the film's flaws, the depiction of married life and the way that poetry is worked into the story is very moving, and I do feel this is worth watching, at least for established Jarmusch fans or those comfortable with indie cinema.",Paterson

Adam Driver plays a bus driver named Paterson, who drives a bus through a downtown route in Paterson. He writes poetry, and lives in Paterson (his house might have been filmed in Yonkers, alas) with his wife who stays at home and paints everything in the house black and white. They have a dog, Marvin, who is another star of this movie. Yeah, it's charming and delightful, yet it's by the icy-cold Jim Jarmusch, go figure. It's about poetry and poets and people who come from Paterson, like Lou Costello and Allen Ginsburg and Hurricane Carter and Frederick Reines, the Nobel Prize- winning physicist who co-discovered the neutrino. Several scenes are filmed at the beautiful Passaic Falls (unfortunately, it must have been a dry season, the falls are a bit trickly). It's a deadpan comic delight-- and there is nothing in the whole movie about crime or decay or corruption or evil. It's wholly sweet, and especially sweet for North Jerseyites, who often fail to see the poetry around them.",Paterson

In addition, all this delicacy benevolent submerges you all along this movie, great art. This movie is to be prescribed to all the strained people of our modern life. In conclusion, we must not forget this beautiful couple that releases so much sweetness, kindness and tenderness that are: Adam Driver in the role Paterson and Golshifteh Farahani in the role of Laura, and you will see or have seen a magnificent movie",Paterson
71,Ziglet_mir,Paterson and Poetry,9,22 April 2017,"I am a poet, and that was enough for me to connect with Adam Driver's Paterson, a man living in Paterson, New Jersey and drives a bus. This is not to say that you have to be a poet to connect to this beautiful film or Adam Driver's character of Paterson. There is a lot to like here, and it's all so plain and simple. The routine of the characters is simple and not much of anything seems to come through with meaning beyond what it is, and this is where Jim Jarmusch greatly succeeds with this film. Films that take their time and choose to be poetic can certainly be beautiful, but they are usually at risk for coming off as pretentious (one of the major qualms people I know have with 'The Tree of Life' just as an example). But 'Paterson' is *just* simple, and the film allows you to interpret things as you see them without there being some sort of notion that makes you think this is supposed to be deeper than what you're feeling, and that's the beauty of Ron Padgett's poetry (the poet of most of the poems we see and hear in the film). 'Paterson' doesn't try too hard to be beautiful and that's exactly the result. There is nothing over the top, and the occasional words that fly on the screen help aid the visual poetry we already see.Adam Driver hands in my favorite male performance of 2016, and Golshifteh Faharani along with Driver have amazing chemistry which make their relationship and life seem real. The characters of Everett and Marie are indeed interesting as well, and fill some screen time with a minor love-story of their own.I appreciate the mentioning and homage to the great poet William Carlos Williams (or Carlos Williams Carlos whichever you prefer), and really this is what the film is speaking to for most of it; the simple beauty of Paterson, and the man himself who came from Paterson. My personal favorite is 'Red Wheelbarrow', but the mentioning of the plum poem is good too. The main reason I give this film such high praise is really for the poetry because some lines have never left my mind ""If you ever left me I'd take my heart out and never put it back"". Just absolutely heavy, well-written stuff, perhaps lighting the screen of the TV of the woman you love for the first time.",Paterson

73,untilnow99,It put me on edge,6,16 June 2017,"When my friends try to tell me the plot of a movie (or a book), I say, adamantly, ""Stop! No! I don't want to know. I just want to see/read it. Don't tell me about it."" Typically, the friend tries to continue with, ""Oh, but I just wanted to tell you this one little bit . . .""As per usual, I saw Paterson without knowing a single thing about it beforehand, except that IMDb gave it a great rating. 7.8. I was thinking I would see something really special.About 15 minutes in I said to myself, ""Another five minutes. I'll give this another five minutes and then that's it."" S-l-o-w, oh my gawd. Slow doesn't even begin to describe this film.Of course, I couldn't stop watching, because by that time I had already been overcome by a palpable feeling of dread and foreboding. Something really really bad was bound to happen. The movie couldn't just be dragging on and on like this without some horrible accident or death or some terrifically twisted and dark series of events to liven things up, right?Wrong. On and on it dragged. And I became more and more apprehensive and unnerved. Was a crazed bus passenger going to stab Paterson to death? Was Laura going to turn out to be a serial killer? Maybe she was poisoning the quinoa and Brussels sprouts. She just had that ""sweet innocent"" evil thing going on, I was sure of it.Paterson got up every day, drove the bus, read us his poetry. Drank his dismal beers.I got a bit aggravated about how he would leave Marvin the dog outside the bar for who knows how long, every single night. You just know that pavement had to be cold and nasty. People probably threw up on that pavement.It didn't surprise me that Marvin was the mail box post culprit. Why wasn't Marvin pooping in Paterson's shoes? That's what any other self-respecting dog would have done.More poetry. A weird scene with a little girl and a mother who didn't seem to care one single bit that a tall, dark stranger was sitting next to her little girl in an alley.More famous personalities' portraits and news pics up on the bar wall. I recognized Sylvia Earle. (The lady with the diving bell.) I stopped the movie to look her up. Yep. She was born in New Jersey, but not in Paterson. Hmm.Okay. I didn't hate the movie. I watched it to the very end, still thinking maybe something terribly wonderful or dreadfully awful was going to take place. It was kind of predictable that Marvin was going to eat the secret poetry book. That was nothing shocking.All-in-all I think Paterson (the movie) was only so-so. Too slow. I liked the one previous reviewer's comment about ""meager clapping"" from the audience at the end (in the theatre), but then it turned out that the sound was just some woman slapping her husband awake. Just about everyone I know would have been sound asleep after the first 10 minutes----if they hadn't already left the theatre.And here's my big spoiler: Marvin was played by ""Nellie"" the dog. If I thought any of my ""Just let me tell you about this one scene"" pals were going to see Paterson I would make sure ahead of time to tell them about Nellie. That would really spoil it for them, for sure.",Paterson
74,vsks,"Who Knew Everyday Life Could Be So, Well, Poetic?",10,26 April 2017,"Oppressed (or freaked out) by the news? Here's a calming and rewarding way to spend two hours in a movie theater cocoon. Writer/director Jim Jarmusch's movie Paterson doesn't travel far, but it's a pleasant journey. Adam Driver plays a New Jersey Transit bus driver (possibly he was cast based on his name alone) named Paterson, who drives a bus in—you knew it!—Paterson, New Jersey. He lives there with his wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and their English bulldog, Marvin (Nellie). Though he follows the same routine and drives the same bus route every day, Paterson is not bored, because his creative imagination is fully engaged. A basement poet, he polishes his creations on the job, and they scroll gently across the screen as he makes his rounds or studies the Passaic River's Great Falls. He carries his books of poetry—especially that of William Carlos Williams—and listens to the small talk of his passengers, the rhythm of their language as much as the words. It's ""a movie that's filled with poetry and that is a poem in itself. The movie's very being is based in echoes and patterns,"" said Richard Brody in The New Yorker. Laura bursts forth with her own creative endeavors, the only common thread of which is their black-and-white color scheme. Black-and-white frosted cupcakes—a big hit at the farmer's market—which she hopes will make them rich; a black and white harlequin guitar, which she hopes will launch her career as a country singer. She's a charming dabbler and Paterson's muse. Every night when he returns home, it seems some other part of their house or Laura's wardrobe has been reconceived in her favorite non-color combination. I couldn't help believing that at some point she'll recognize that her immense talent with fabric would be an awesome career direction. Meanwhile, her patterns fill Paterson with visual interest, ""creating a vibrant visual punctuation to the otherwise relaxed storytelling,"" said Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. Paterson the driver, or perhaps I should say, Driver as Paterson, has one extracurricular activity, a visit to a neighborhood tavern every evening. Lots happens during that one nightly beer. Most of it hilarious. The décor of the tavern, replete with articles about Paterson greats—especially Lou Costello—further ties the man and the story to a circumscribed geography, the launchpad for his words. Driver, Farahani, and Nellie play their roles winningly, with a memorable, if small, supporting cast.",Paterson

The acting from everyone is such a pleasure to watch; there is not one character who is a turn-off. Even the dog is a delight, and one keeps looking forward to the next surprise coming from it.

The film is an almost uneventful, slow, silent account of a week in the small town of Paterson, a bus driver who shares his name with a famous poet. Of course, this week is not without waves, but watching the film will feel that even the waves of the film is also very ordinary splash.

This one is a bit of a slow burn but it did eventually draw me in. What I took away from it was him almost taking a real day to day life and putting it on the screen and how that alters our expectations. Since we're watching a movie we expect and almost want exciting and unlikely things to happen but they don't.The 2 leads are excellent. I've seen Adam Driver in a few things but he puts out such a subtle yet powerful performance as a bus driver that writes poetry. I was not familiar with the actor playing his wife, Golshifteh Farahani but she was great as well. She brought almost a playful quality to the role that reminded me a bit of Salma Hayek. It feels like a realistic marriage with no artificial drama.Overall, it still suffers from being a bit aimless as I did check how much time was left more than once.

85,stroggos,"Warm and truly poetic, full of interesting detail",7,6 May 2017,"PATERSON follows the life of a bus driver with an ambition for poetry and his dreamy wife, who's seeking ever new outlets for her endless creativity. In a way, not much happens—we follow his life, how he walks the dog, how his wife makes cupcakes. But in fact, SO MUCH happens in this movie.The atmosphere, imagery and general weirdness of the movie are an invitation for you to rethink ""normal"" everyday life. If you take this invitation, you'll love PATERSON. If you can't slow down to appreciate the unexceptional, you will hate it.Most Hollywood movies are about heroes, spies, politicians ... people who are in some way important or powerful. PATERSON makes you rethink ""the little people"". One of the core messages is that our lives are infused with weirdness and irony. And that there's creativity in everybody, even people whom you wouldn't expect to be creative. And the movie asks you to see and feel the genuine poetry of the mundane.When I watched PATERSON with friends in the movie theatre, something truly poetic happened that reflects on how powerful this movie is. Towards the very few final moments of the movie, somebody's phone started ringing VERY LOUDLY, for quite a long time, filling the entire movie theatre with sound. At first, everybody was a bit annoyed but then the phone stopped EXACTLY when the final shot turned to black. The whole theatre started laughing ... the timing of the ringtone with the final image and the banality of this event happening towards the end of such a quiet and slow movie were so ironic to the audience, because we were all in a ""poetic"" mood, appreciating events that would otherwise make us angry.And that's really what PATERSON's core message is: Rethink the normal.

As long as the film follows Adam Driver's Paterson character, it's charming. It was interesting to see how his interactions with co-workers, bus patrons, and random people he meets at bars or in a park influence him and give him ideas for poetry. I loved how the poems came to life, with Paterson repeating lines and then building on them in a way that I would imagine a real author would create a poem. But, I was less engaged with the film whenever Paterson went home to his wife, a stereotypical spicy and exotic immigrant with a sexy accent but no job and no real passions. She's a dilettante whose interests change on a whim. One minute she's a committed baker jazzed about cupcakes, at least until she moves on to professing a newfound love for country music and playing the guitar. Not sure if this was supposed to be some sort of fantasy for ordinary guys to make them think they, too, can get a hot chick by being a bus driver who's into poetry, but I didn't believe their relationship at all.

91,SteveMierzejewski,The Poetry of Everyday Life,8,10 February 2017,"For those not familiar with Jim Jarmusch's work, you may find this movie puzzling. There will be no explosions, shoot outs, or car chases. Jarmusch doesn't just focus on a slice of life. He focuses on the crumbs of life. These crumbs are often organized around a simple, sometimes absurd, theme. This could be anything from driving to see Lake Erie (Stranger Than Paradise) to traveling to visit ex-girlfriends (Broken Flowers). The pace is non-existent. In Paterson, the earth spins around day after day but everyone still comes back to the same point in space. The theme is the poetry of everyday life.As usual, Jarmusch comes up with a group of quirky, somewhat deadpan characters. The main characters are a husband and wife; a bus driver poet and a homemaker designer. They are perfectly suited to each other, but only to each other. Big tragedies occur over insignificant things that are not insignificant for those experiencing them. We don't learn much about either of the couple's past except for the photo of Paterson (Adam Driver) in a US Marine uniform which is placed beside his bed. His wife, Laura (expertly played by Golshifteh Farahani)is obsessed with incorporating black and white, and only black and white, into all of her designs. You can make what symbolism you want of this, but I'm surprised Jarmusch doesn't put some black and white scenes in the film. We do, however, see the couple watch an old black and white film.Those who know Jarmusch will more than likely enjoy this film. It lives up to the standard that he has set for himself. It is a collection of mundane and oddball events that range from being poignant to amusing. The characters are well acted and realistic, without being exaggerated. There are lessons to be learned here, but, like the interpretation of a Pollock painting, you'll have to interpret these things for yourself.Definitely not for everybody, but for those who want to experience someone else's daily routine and, in so doing, see the poetry that may be already present in their own lives.",Paterson
92,antcol8,"You call it ""Poetry"". But I call it Doggerel...",6,17 January 2017,"I really don't know what to do with the reviews here. They treat this film like a Masterpiece. Or like it's boring and worthless. It's neither. But this is 2016, and every truly Independent film is haunted by the specter of the incipient End of Cinema As We Have Known It. So some of us feel that we must cheer a film that has a sense of art, of smallness, of observation, of epiphany.And this film contains all of these things. But Poetry...I actually don't know what Poetry is supposed to do. But it seems to me that its use of chains of images should sneak up on you and reveal themselves over several readings, and not bang you over the head: Poem about Waterfalls - Waterfalls. Discussion of Twins - Twins - More Twins. Iranian Girlfriend - Decorations all over the House which look like Black and White Persian Iconography - finishing with a Farsi T - shirt. Black Rapper (remember, it's POETRY) channeling Paul Laurence Dunbar, and even saying that he wears the mask. Paterson - William Carlos Williams. Japanese Guy comes to discover American Poetics = Mystery Train. Wonderful Old - School African - American Bar Owner = Lester Young on the Juke Box/the Classic Blue Collar Intellectual Bar Chess Players. I'm sure Jarmusch read Cotton Goes to Harlem, with its centrally important Lester Young scene...All this is OK. Even nostalgia for the time when one regularly encountered Blue Collar Intellectuals as part of the Urban Landscape is OK. I just find it all so pathetically obvious and sentimental. I feel like we honor real film poets like Ozu, Bresson,Renoir, Ford, etc. by not reifying ""Film Poetry"", nodding and winking to the audience each time we link something to something else. But I think it's a sign of the times: ""Art Films"" are desperate to hold on to their audience - or their Market Share, if I can put it like that. We can analyze the crisis in cinema more clearly by looking at what is considered a good or well - made film nowadays than by talking about ""Junk"". Even though Junk was probably better made at one time. But it was still junk.I want to finish by quoting James Agee, talking about John Ford's The Fugitive: ""I dislike allegory and symbolism which are imposed on and denature reality as deeply as I love both when they bloom from and exalt reality"". And what would Frank O'Hara say? Nothing very positive, I am sure...He hated Poetic Pretension, in all of its forms. And Paterson's unpretentiousness is pretentious indeed.",Paterson

The film is a tribute to Paterson, NJ's famous poet, William Carlos Williams and to the notion of celebrating reality by recording it in a faithful, painterly fashion without embellishment or sermonizing.If you don't demand a lot of action or forward motion you are more likely to enjoy this film as a kind of modernist poem in itself. You have a cute grumpy dog to entertain you, an idealized love relationship to wonder about, and some complete red herrings such as omnipresent twins to distract you from the static still-life character of the film.",Paterson

At the end my wife asked how it was and I said I'm not sure what I just watched.Paterson follows Paterson (Adam Driver) as he goes about his existence in Paterson, New Jersey. He wakes up (always at the same time), eats breakfast, goes to his job as a bus driver, and comes home to talk to his significant other. During this he also writes poetry.When I mentioned how you watch it having significant impact on how you feel about the movie, this can likely be best described in the poetry. To me, the poetry didn't say anything. It was more flow of consciousness of what is going through Paterson's mind. He eavesdrops while driving the bus, because he has nothing else to do. He goes to the same bar daily and has his circle of people he talks to about nothing in particular. His relationship seems more like a person trying to not rock the boat, than anything active.And maybe in all this is the point of the movie. At the end Paterson mentions a song with the line would you rather be a fish. And I think that might be the point. Look at this past week. Nothing much happened. SSDD.

95,don2507,"A Pleasing, Feel-Good Film of Modest Aspirations",8,11 November 2019,"Okay, I agree with a number of reviewers on this site that not a lot of dramatic action happens in this film, but for me at least, it's an absorbing depiction of a week in the life of an ""ordinary"" bus driver; that is, an ""ordinary"" bus driver who writes minimalist poetry in the moments afforded him while driving his bus. Ralph Kramden he is not. There is a certain ""poetry"" in this visual depiction of the day-by-day routine of an honest and likable workingman as he walks the same route to the bus depot, gets the same complaints from the despatcher, and walks the same evening route while walking his dog, not to mention the nightly beer at the same bar. Routines can admittedly stultify us and rob us of stimulating milieus for creativity, but they can also, as in ""Paterson,"" provide the stability for creative effort, in this case writing poetry. And then again, the varied ""stimulation"" our driver does get is from the conversations he overhears on the bus from failed sexual escapades to European politics.An appealing feature of this film is the likability of just about all of the characters including the driver's loving wife. This may deter dramatic conflict, except for the estranged couple in the bar, but does make for the film's ""easy going"" feeling. In addition, I liked the fact that, as a multi-racial film, everybody seemed to get along well together. The white bus driver frequents a black bar where he's welcome, and provides encouragement to an aspiring black rapper who's appreciative. The Indian despatcher provides some light comic relief, and our bus driver poet and a Japanese lover of poetry have an amiable discussion on poetry at the end of the film.

In any movie, one can find elements that would be of interest.This movie's theme is Paterson's daily life and how he takes some issues of becoming a father or probably being stuck in a bus driver job for the end of his life - A fish in a bowl -
The problem is I cannot emphasize with the characters unless they tell me something about the age or society they are living in. A perfect example would be an actual poetry such as The Mirror by Tarkovsky, who manages to capture an entire life with images and poems in a single film. It deals with director's own history as well as his childhood memories and condition of his society.With this outlook, Paterson does not seem to be an everlasting film neither about virtues of daily life nor about the glory of dealing with art.",Paterson

He puts it outside a pub, have a beer and return. The next day is just like the one that just left him. Few differences, but maybe he creates a new poem.This sounds flat, but it's not flat at all. Paterson is probably the nicest man in the world, maybe one of the most boring ones too, but his niceness and calmness makes up for it. This is a very observing film and it magically lets you digest it easily. It may be the nice shots, the constant, non-rushing pace or the many appearing small moments that reminds you of why life is so great in real life.At first I didn't know what to make of this film but the performances are top notch and the film grows on you. The slow burning film has a lot of love and the poetry that our lead character reads gives the film depth that would otherwise feel like an odd choice to have in the film. The character of Paterson is brilliantly played and it's the filmmakers talent that holds our interest for the entire film.",Paterson

100,i_ianchev,The mundane life of a great poet,9,12 January 2017,"Don't let me misguide you - this is not a controversial movie, this is a slow paced film about the small things in life which make us happy. And which we miss all the time...So, yes - Adam Driver - he is the movie, no doubt about that. Just check his non profit organization (http://www.aitaf.org) and you will see that he really was ""the one"" for this role. And his picture in the marine corp suit in the movie is a real one. This also leads us to get the impression that he (as a quiet poet, driving every day a bus in a smaller city named the same as his character) is the centerpiece on the film. Yes, but to some extent. I think that the real main character of this beautiful art piece is the mundane life itself. With every good and bad thing about it. I also need to favor the supporting cast - from Golshifteh Farahani (what a name!) to all the twins seen in this movie - everybody plays exceptionally well. I just didn't get the Everett role - maybe because it seemed like a piece from a stage acting class done as a separate enclave in this movie. I understand the purpose of the whole Marie and Everett vehicle, but it still seemed a bit odd and off for me. Other than that - the ensemble of actors is really great. And the city of Paterson - I wonder if Jim Jarmush's whole idea was to create this film as an ode to this city. Probably yes! And it sounds pretty romantic (given the circumstances) to a 30-year old male from Bulgaria, thousand of miles far away from this location. So the whole background story of the city itself clicks pretty well for the viewer I think.The music is a bit strong at times but generally favors the situations and emotions and compliments them. This is a very ordinary story and at the same time it creates extraordinary feelings in the viewer - that we must enjoy our lives as they are, not necessary as we want to think they are. Love, compassion, romanticism, calmness, diversity - every word fits well for this film. I enjoyed it quietly, calmly and respectfully. It is a movie for the lovebirds for the families, for the local communities, it is a movie for every one.So, although it might seem slow and that nothing ever will happen in it - great things appear under the surface of this motion picture. Humanity itself is peeking out from Paterson's character. Mundane, yet full of creative energy, ready to burst from the screen.Please support this movie, so that others like it are made more often!",Paterson
101,Teyss,"Poetic ""Groundhog Day"" without the fun",5,9 December 2016,"First of all, I kindly remind IMDb users that, if you want to click on ""Yes"" or ""No"" at the bottom of this review, the question is: ""Was the above review useful to you?"", NOT ""Do you agree with the above review?"", nor ""Do you agree with the rating without reading the above review?"". Thank you.Second, just to explain where I stand, I do like artistic movies, even slow ones, and even some of Jim Jarmusch's. They are offbeat, contemplative and somewhat poetic. In ""Paterson"", poetry is obviously his chief ambition: the main character is an amateur poet, there are talks about (more or less) famous poets and it relies on ""everyday poetry"", if this makes sense.One poetic component is repetition: the main character has the same name as the city he lives in; we see many twins (thus a ""double repetition""); events occur repeatedly; there are a few correspondences (for instance Laura has the same name as Petrarch's muse); the camera focuses on leitmotifs (watch, cereals, lunchbox, mailbox, beer glass, etc.). All this creates ""internal rhymes"" that, interestingly, are missing from Paterson's poems. What about these poems, by the way? They are sort of nice in their genre, however do we really need to hear them two or three times each, and see them written on top of that? It would have required an outstanding style, which I think is lacking.Another poetic ingredient is oddity: strange elements slowly spill into an otherwise ordinary life.The black and white motifs created by Laura progressively invade the house: curtains, painting, carpets, clothing, and even the spare wheel cover of their car. When Paterson and Laura go to the cinema, they watch a horror movie which is, echoing Laura's motifs, in black and white (an additional correspondence). Small objects have a magical touch, notably the matchbox. Everett draws a gun in the bar. There are uncommon encounters, for instance the young poetess, the separating couple and the Japanese tourist. Entertaining, in a way.Another phenomenon is the ""enchanted bubble"" sensation. It is a happy life: Paterson and Laura have a relatively easy time (although he seems on the edge, yet nothing wrong happens); they love each other; everybody is friendly; it is always sunny. There are no news from the outside world. The couple is isolated from family, real friends and neighbours, if any; they have no TV, no computer; he has no mobile phone. The rare issues are trifle: gang youngsters in a convertible just provide a fair warning; the Indian driver's problems are not so dramatic (especially considering how he describes them); Everett's gun is fake; the bus breaks down without consequences. The only drama is the loss of the secret book, however Paterson continues to write on another notebook given by Providence. Moreover, it is comforting to see hidden talents behind apparently simple personalities (writing, cooking, decorating, chess, etc.): it demonstrates we all have something to express.Last, there is some form of humour, notably with the above-mentioned invasive motifs, the grumpy dog and the contrast between Paterson and Laura. She is enthusiastic, eccentric, willing to try all sorts of activities; she dreams of fame and actually is rather talented. He is reserved, quiet, slightly puzzled by her; he just wants a peaceful life and is talented as well, as a writer. She always is onto something new (and sometimes weird) while he is stuck in routine. Amusing, to an extent.And then? Well, that's about it. The movie mainly relies on these bits and pieces. It is enough for a short film, however here it drags on for almost two hours. In the end, the ensemble feels somewhat pointless: this is partly intentional, of course, but it did limit my appreciation.So what is missing? Probably, ""Paterson"" does not go far enough in its ambition. For instance, the bizarre touch could have been pushed further, to explore a different dimension. Or the humour. Or the elaboration of a stronger poetic structure. Or a progression of some sort. Or the inclusion of themes, adding depth and triggering another emotion than just having a pleasant time.-----I cannot rate the movie lower than 5/10 because it is not terrible. There are a few interesting ideas, characters are likable, it is laid back, it changes form the standard blockbuster. Yet I cannot rate it higher because it did not appeal to me: it doesn't have much substance, doesn't evolve and doesn't provide a lasting impression, unlike exceptional films that linger in the mind for days. Not bad, not great, just in the middle. Half-baked.But then, appreciating poetry is very subjective. Hence it is understandable some persons find the movie captivating and rate it 10/10 (which is easier to defend than the same rating for ""Police Academy 6""). On the other hand, it also is understandable persons find it utterly boring and rate it 1/10 (which is easier to defend than the same rating for ""Citizen Kane""). Question of personal sensitivity to this style.""Paterson"" tries to illustrate James Tate's brilliant quote: ""Poetry is everywhere; it just needs editing.""

They're how they had to be: Real. Convincing. Just that. It's not a film that really needed impressive performances.Other things that I personally liked about this, were the cute scenes of the two protagonists together, how they supported each other every time. I couldn't avoid to smile in all those scenes. The settings were very good too. And the script was perfectly balanced and even funny at times.In general, it is a movie that has to be seen by everyone who appreciates those little details of the daily life, and for those who doesn't, so they start appreciating them better.Thanks for reading!",Paterson

I saw the and the answer is simple. In fact, the answer is in the movie itself!If you are a fan of William Carlos Williams or a fan of Archibald McLeish (both poets), then the answer is throughout the film. Unlike many of today's films, this one celebrates the essence of a film by just being a film. McLeish offers an answer in his poem, ""Ars Poetica"" where he asserts a poem does not ""mean,"" it simply is.Williams also offers an answer in his works: there is an inherent value in the the ""thingness of things"" whether it is the bowl of plums reference in this film or in the red wheelbarrow.What Jarmush has given us is an excellent example of what these two poets told us years ago: there is value in the small and simple things of life. That is all this film is about and we are told, point blank, at the end of the movie: the Japanese poet asks Paterson if he, too, is a poet. Paterson says, no; he is only a bus driver. The Japanese poet says, ""This could be a poem by William Carlos Williams.""And, indeed, that is what we have just seen.",Paterson

An appreciation on routine, I tried to find a plot within the first 20 minutes, only to realise the plot was nothing more than what was unraveling on-screen - the everyday life of Paterson. Adam Driver completely steals this. From watching ""The Force Awakens"" I viewed him as a decent actor, but after this I can clearly say that he's very very good at what he does. Paterson is very hard to read and I ended up the film not knowing whether he is happy or incredibly frustrated with his life. That's what really makes you think - specially because of the way it ends. I was 100% absorbed during the film, and that's what really sold me.

110,PrashunChakraborty,Sublime,9,15 October 2018,"I missed this back when it was released but it was always on my mind to catch this. I liked Jarmusch's last venture, Only Lovers Left Alive and was expecting a similar cool indie film with great visuals but Paterson is a wholly different beast and in my personal opinion better. It's a ""slice of life"" genre of film rather than drama so nothing much happens but beneath the surface there's so much to process. Adam Driver (gives his career best performance here and continues to prove that he is more than just Kylo Ren) is a reserved bus driver who doesn't speak much to his co-workers, his friends at the bar or even his live in girlfriend but truly comes alive while writing poetry. The film never holds your hand and you have to work out the ins and outs of his mind. He isn't troubled, leads a very normal life, is loved by his girlfriend, liked by his friends and coworkers. There's nothing wrong with Paterson and spoiler alert nothing will be found wrong with him when the film ends, but this quiet person scribbles away in his poetry book expressing his innermost thoughts, fears and desires which he hides from rest of the world. The film also has a theme of Paterson running into twins which I think is Jarmusch's way of hinting twin personalities of not only Paterson but all of us. Two people who look the same but are different people just like Paterson has two twins, one's what we see a reserved person with his coworkers and girlfriend and the other is this private expressive poet. The film saves it's best scene for the last which was very moving and got to me. Very interesting mature film, would highly recommend.",Paterson

112,madbeast,Sweet and quirky but ultimately pointless,6,5 January 2017,"Paterson is a puzzling mix of a drab motif without a story and an ingratiating look at a rather sweet man. At the end, I didn't feel like it added up to much but I have to admit that I was never bored and was always interested to see what would happen, even if nothing ever really did.The film centers around a bus driver in Paterson, NJ who is coincidentally named Paterson. There is nothing remarkable whatsoever about Paterson except that in his spare time he writes some reasonably okay poetry in a notebook. He is also a kind man who protectively sits with little girls who are alone waiting for their mothers, gives money to homeless guys in the street and patiently puts up with the antics of his scatter-brained wife (who, to her credit, loves him to the depths of her soul and is smokin' hot to boot). He also has a really cool dog.There's really nothing more to say about the film than that. Nothing even approaching a structured story ever occurs and since the bus driver lacks any ambitions for his poetry (or even wants to share it with anyone besides his wife), I was at a loss to understand why I should care about it anymore than he did (the poetry isn't bad but it would be an uphill struggle to get it published anywhere). A great deal is made about Paterson's unwillingness to make copies of his hand-written poems or even to show them to anyone and I felt that if he was so dismissive of his efforts, I didn't know why I should feel any differently.The saving grace of the film is the ingratiating performance of Adam Driver, who provided a highly watchable center to an otherwise pointless endeavor. The film might have been a pretentious mess if the character had taken his poetry too seriously but since he only seems to be writing it for the sheer enjoyment of it, I found myself able to forgive him his essential mediocrity. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave Driver their Best Actor award for 2016 which I think is going way too far, but I can see why someone would think his work was the most memorable aspect of the film.In the final analysis, I liked Paterson's quirky aspects and its sweet and chewy center but I never really saw what the point to it was.

He lives with his beautiful wife who just had a dream about having twins. His apartment is a bit crammed but cosy and he has an ugly dog. He walks to work. He drives a bus. Before his shift he starts writing a new poem in his notebook. The poem opens with a mundane emotionless observation, so it could go either way (he could be a terrible poet or not) - as it develops, it turns out to be kinda good. He drives the bus through town, occasionally overhearing people's conversations and vaguely smiling at parts that he finds curious. He's off work, he walks home. He fixes the crooked letterbox. His wife is a bit of a black-and-white-obsessed manic pixie dream girl, but more earthy, more compassionate (is she real? she must be). He takes the dog out for a walk, ties it outside the local bar where he has exactly one drink and a chat with the owner.Tuesday morning comes and it all starts again. Then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... Minimal deviations from the routine, just little amusing bits here and there. A new poem every day. A new set of twins (there's so many in this town, are they real? they must be). A new black-and-white creative idea by his wife. A new conversation with the bartender. Watching Paterson's days go by I caught myself finding this routine satisfying (in an almost obsessive-compulsive way) and wishing nothing will happen to break it. I kept wondering whether the routine was safe from major incidents but, being caught up in its nearly hypnotising rhythm, I mostly kept wondering whether this is real life or not. Hence the title of this review.There is no hint in the movie that this is not real life, except for the many coincidences (e.g. the recurrence of twins, the continuous references to the waterfall and to the name Paterson - the town, the bus, the person, the poem) and the almost surreal nature of every interaction the main character has with people he encounters outside the house and in streets that sometimes seem abandoned.I didn't, myself, come away thinking it may not have been real life, but the question lingered in a more symbolic way: is Paterson happy? Is he trapped or is he liberated?If I had to pick, I'd say that this life, for Paterson, is heaven:He is a content man. This is highlighted every time others complain to him about their lives and he has nothing to offer in exchange. Nothing to complain about.He is free from anger. Even in the (comparatively) worst moment of his week, when he should have been furious with his dog and maybe explode in rage against it, he looks at it and says serenely ""I don't like you, Marvin"".He has perspective. I think it all ultimately boils down to this. Paterson knows what is and what isn't worth fussing about. He is fully aware of his bliss and he is not looking for anything bigger or better. A lot of this may be due to -what is only seen as a glimpse of a photograph and never talked about - his military past. His strict routine comes from it and so does the full appreciation of the fact that any daily setbacks/minor incidents are not life-or-death situations.I think Adam Driver's own military past may have been crucial in him being perfectly cast in this role. He has a kind of rigidity and self-restraint which is not usual for an actor and is exactly the thing he can tap into when portraying Paterson, of Paterson, bus driver and poet.",Paterson

122,hnapel,"A calm movie that reflects on life, duty, art and poetry.",8,3 September 2018,"Paterson is a calm movie, it entices you to reflect, on such things as life, duty, art and poetry. A bus driver in the somewhat infamous town of Paterson, incidentally also named Paterson himself dabbles in poetry and is encouraged by his beautiful wife Laura to do more with that and moreover, to make a backup copy of his 'secret' notebook in which he writes is little poems, that for the movie were borrowed in kind from an actual poet. The fantasy of screenwriters can only go so far so they hired a specialist. I say somewhat infamous because of the most notable legacy of the town Nobel laureate Bob Dylan wrote about, its law enforcement's racist tendencies and the fallacies of the American Justice system so perfectly illustrated by the case of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. It is touched upon in the movie by a few children passengers that our bus driver happens to overhear. The name of Laura is not an arbitrary one, it is the name of the muse of the famous Italian Renaissance poet Petrarch. Like the bus driver, Laura also has ambitions and dreams about breaking away from their simple life that they nevertheless seem to enjoy happily. We must also consider the benefits of being able to let your mind wander freely to artistic heights when your day-job doesn't demand a great deal of intellectual capacity, so like Einstein who was dreaming big while working as a clerk in a patent office, being a bus driver and an aspiring poet might not be such a far fetched combination of occupations. The film is full of hints and hidden messages of which I probably missed a few. In a fairly big town such as Paterson, especially in public transport where you would see a lot of people, encountering a few twins now and then should not be a surprise, but if your wife told you she had been dreaming of having twin babies ('one for each of us') you suddenly notice them everywhere. The story encompasses one whole week and the days have an absolute repetitive character, but it is the little deviations from the suspected strict routine that make you realize that everyday is still special. Some of the routine events are disrupted spectacularly, for example everyday he drives trough town quite uneventful, then one day the bus breaks down and it's a big situation, with all the passengers on the sidewalk and needing to call bus headquarters with a borrowed child's cellphone. Another example (I warned you for spoilers...) is the bar he frequents daily when walking his mischievous little dog, some tension had been built up there over a guy trying to win back the love of his lifelong friend that he could not get to be promoted to an actual girlfriend with its associated benefits, but you would not immediately expect he would turn into a gun toting maniac threatening to first kill the girl and then himself. But no police needs to arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night since Paterson disarms him before he can do anything (and the gun appears to be fake...). Then, if you payed enough attention, you might remember Paterson was in the army because there's a photograph of him in uniform on the bedside table, yes he knows his way around. Disaster strikes when Mr. doggy eats the secret notebook before the promised backup could be made, but as Paterson walks out to let off some steam he meets a ghost of Christmas past in the form of a Japanese poet who hands him a fresh empty notebook which is the symbol of a grand new beginning, more concretely that is the next Monday that looks suspiciously like the first, since by now we know the drill that is the logical end.",Paterson

I felt as if I was watching reality programming about characters that you can not help but root for. I became emotionally invested in the first 15 minutes and by films end was concerned for and gave a damn about all of their outcomes. The theme of the film is the poetry in everyday life that surrounds us. The triumph's and setbacks faced by real people and how they deal with the obstacle's that get in the way of aspirations and dreams. A breath of fresh air from films where the stakes and risks are larger than life itself.

Paterson, however, is ordinary in every way.Paterson focuses on the ordinary, meaningless tasks of everyday life and the audience waits patiently for something to happen. It becomes painfully obvious that the overall point is in the ""beauty"" of seemingly ordinary instances and observations. The main flaw is this: we experience this every day and it is completely paradoxical to watch a movie based on this concept when we see these events daily. It reminds me of having to watch Groundhog Day without the protagonist growing beyond the first day. Jarmusch's direction does not help or hinder the film, but the writing severely lacks any passion at all whatsoever. This seems intentional, but the actors painfully deliver awkward lines that do not reflect natural conversations. It actually felt like many of them were reading the script for the first time while they were on screen. Due to this, the movie pitifully plods along predictably and ends with a mild artistic, predictable message as well. What Jim Jarmusch accomplished with Coffee and Cigarettes and Stranger Than Paradise was impressive, but this takes many, many steps back and will be forgotten by the time I watch another movie.",Paterson
125,constanza-nm,I could be friends with this guy,6,8 December 2017,"I've read really thorough analyzes about this movie and I think that's beautiful. But I just wanted to give my opinion as a simple observant who happened to watch this movie because she had heard and read it was quite unique.I'm going to be honest. I struggle. Although I'm used to watching slow pace movie this one strike as really boring at first and I had to stop it a couple of time. Nothing really happened and it was so realistic that made me feel a little uncomfortable. It took some time to understand how that is actually a merit for this film. It literally feels like a whole week in 2 hours. One really negative aspect for me that I have to point out is Paterson's girlfriend. It has been a while since I don't dislike a character so much. I just don't get it. I don't get why she is here and why being a movie about ordinary people, there she is being just a cliché of what an ""artist"" is supposed to be. She has a clear fixation with black and white, she makes her own clothes, decorates her own house, has new passions all the time, doesn't seem to have a job. What's the point? To have a contrast against Paterson? To prove that opposites attract? I just don't understand. The only good thing about having her in the movie is that you have this character (her) that is supposed to be ""interesting"" because she is so different right? but actually, the one that calls my attention, the one that I want to see on screen, the one that I would love to know it's this other character, the normal and average Paterson. His simplicity is just really appealing. I like this guy. I really do. He grows on you.Overall, I don't regret watching this movie. I think I understood its main idea. There's beauty in the small things in life. However, I'm not sure if I would recommend it, 'cause it may seem too different and not for everyone. I write poetry myself (about different matters though) and I often have found myself amazed at the charm of daily life. Just like Paterson, my job can get really lonely at times. But even having things in common I'm not really like him. I don't live my life like that neither I want to. So, I could say this movie is not exactly for me, but, I must also say that I'm thankful for the existence of films like this one. It's refreshing to know that directors and writers care about the average person, about existence itself. That there're people that make movies for the purpose of creating unusual special movies and not just to fulfill certain standards. And I love that.",Paterson

A film that relies not on flashy cinematography, alluring characters or shock tactics, but rather on telling a story simply, and well.
A story of one man, his dog, his partner and his life.
And how his daily rituals both liberate his creativity, and keep him trapped. 
And how we all need a muse to interupt and inspire us. To challenge us to our truth, and to just be there for us at the end of our own daily rituals. 
Paterson is a film made on a small budget, in a small town with a small cast of amazing actors. It's message however is huge.

128,nyancatcandy,Poetry in motion,10,24 May 2019,"Paterson is just a normal guy, living a normal life, working as a bus driver, doing the same old things day in and day out. What brings this film alive is its sense for poems. And that is a poem by itself.Everyday life may for many people seem like the thing they want to avoid. They seek thrills through expensive worldwide travels, late friday nights dance clubs, or just making the most of every day. ""Carpe diem"", so to say. But Paterson shows exactly the opposite. It fills you with joy and a sort of happiness towards the everyday life. It finds the smallest of comfort in the faintest of details, through beutiful poems and heartening confrontations. Rather than showing the problem with trying too hard to reach for success, like many other movies, Paterson instead celebrates the life of ordinary people. And it honestly makes you feel more at ease with living an ordinary life - not having to chase the sunset at all times.This film also celebrates poetry. Poetry that exhilarates the beauty in everyday life. It is not only the poetry of the actual poems, but the poetry in the film itself. Such as having Paterson interact in the gentlest of ways with different strangers he meet throughout the week. It is almost impossible not to let the brilliance in every little scene touch your heart. The brilliant acting of Adam Driver and the admirable directing from Jim Jarmusch helps emphasise this, as the movie takes a very neutral tone.In the end, this film makes you want to live an ordinary life. It does such a good job of finding happines in the small specifics in life, that you can't help but admire it. With this picture, Jarmusch has created a moving poem. A movie poem.",Paterson

Though it seems it is about poetry.... I think it is just a medium to express above mentioned thought. How the man in question avoids and stands decent with the advances of a girl in a bar, how he will not join any argument or discussion with his passengers, how he is able to laugh at a really practical joke and still keep straight face, how he can get the confidence of a 10 year old girl by just saying hi, how he cares for his fellow mates around, how he can make his partner happy just by being there, how he can manage a strategic situation, how he is really brave, so and so on ..... above all, how he can rise from his greatest loss ever and begin again. COMMON MAN !!Don't look for poetry. His poetry was mediocre and not suitable as all know. His POETRY was a mean to go by.

130,frezeframe,Jim Jarmusch doesn't respect your time-,5,30 August 2020,"Patterson: C-
No spoilers possible with this film. Change my mind.When you're 52 minutes in and nothing has happened.. your mind begins to wander. The film has
25 minutes of Adam Driver poetry narration. Adam driver is great at staring in the distance and looking at people, but centering the film over an Adam driver voice over? That's a snooze fest. Adam is just not a great orator. Jim Jarmusch should know better.The film really takes its time developing the characters. We see the characters uninterrupted in moments of just plain reality. There's a lot of repetitive scenes. But the result is only mildy interesting. If something major would've happened halfway through the film, it would've been great, but the entire film is just a cerebral exposition of non relatable life observations that overall was pretty boring. I want to give this film a B- because the acting was good and Jarmusch's cinematic style is always captivating. But the story just isn't there. It's not a B- movie. And he's clearly lost his grit from the 90s Jim Jarmusch. He spends SO much time with Adam driver and his girlfriend and the countless dog close ups, but it just doesn't go anywhere. It's not interesting in cinema to just watch people in mundane reality. It's a privilege now more than ever, when viewers invest their time... with all the endless streaming content. If someone invests in watching a film, they want to be entertained. We're all willing to suspend our believes plot wise just to be entertained.Jim takes his time and I appreciate that. I really like when scenes are allowed to just breathe. Jim does that very well. But too much ""no plot"" is just detrimental. There are so many recurring motives - the looking at the watch, the dog, the bar, the waking up in bed, the girlfriend painting, The negative bus driver coworker, the repetitive poetry writing... It's just not a responsible use of the time you have with an audience. The bus breaking down is the first thing that actually happens in the movie and that's an hour and 15 min in.Turns out in the end, the dog ate Adam Drivers poem book. And Adam driver doesn't care. And that's what the movie is about. Again, no spoilers possible because literally nothing happens. If Jim with the cut out all of the dog stuff I would've gave it a B+.Jim's work in the 90s and 2000s is legendary, but this is a long foul ball.

It isn't particularly a special life but it's not boring either, mundane for sure, but most definitely not boring. The life of a poet in its not so grand form is simplistic and effective under Jarmusch's direction who always seems to find the little fragments of the human condition and put those on full display through his films. Nothing important or mesmerising is shown here which you think would make for a pretty lacklustre feature but something small and intimate is made as charming and as interesting as anything on a bold scale.

Everything in this film is so average and lackluster, it seems deliberate. The acting, the camera-work, the editing, the dialogue are so mediocre, one wonders if this is supposed to be a statement on the meaningless of life. And then there are so many things that one might have considered funny or endearing 20 years ago (Laura's obsession with black and white design, a dog that looks funny, a lopsided letterbox, a whining colleague, etc) but today they just seem utterly trite and obsolete. I know, films don't have to be realistic but all through the 2 excruciatingly dull hours, you can't help but wonder how this nondescript bus driver who writes crappy poems managed to get a model type girlfriend. I wouldn't really care, if there was anything in there that would pique my interest, or if their romance was portrayed in an interesting way, if there was any twist to it, but the opposite seems to be the case. It seems to be constructed as a celebration of dullness. If you don't have anything to say, just stop making films Jim.",Paterson

And yet again, as with Manchester by the Sea, my excitement turned to disappointment as I struggled to keep my eyes open and from nodding off to sleep.Adam Driver has a spot in my heart and I believe he is a strong up and coming actor; one to keep a close eye on. With that said, I am not sure why he was cast in this role. His character makes for a very unlikely match in every way, shape, and form. However, his was the strongest performance, which was far from his best. The rest of the acting was absolutely criminal.I am still struggling with the 1 hour 57 minutes of my life I will never get back, along with the fact that I am starting to lose trust in my fellow IMDb reviewers that gave this film an average of 7.7 when this flick should have barely been able to climb to a 6.Perhaps if you are an artsy fartsy person who is big into poetry, and BAD poetry at that, or perhaps you are a native to Paterson and want to watch it for posterity, then this flick just might be for you.

135,Clipster12,Open yourself up.......,9,20 April 2019,"If ever there was a film to get lost in, to commit yourself too then it is Paterson. All there is here is a mundane life slowed down and focused so we can appreciate and concentrate on what makes life worth living. The very essence of our existence, what makes us soldier on day after day and keep going. Paterson, is a poet, he looks at things differently. We, in turn also get to see through his eyes. He has a good soul, he has time for the people around him and the things he see's on a daily basis. This is enough for him and enough to make a glorious film about it.",Paterson
136,Clipster12,"You don't have to be a poet, to be a poet.",9,17 May 2019,"Poetry, if you are 'artistic' or maybe have artistic parents or were big on English Lit then it probably means something to you. Us normal folk are way to busy for that kind of nonsense.I always feel that given the right education ( probably involving money and different parents) I could have been artistic in whatever form. I like art, I enjoy what I would describe as 'good' films (easy on the narrative), usually in a foreign language but not what you would describe as mainstream, if you get my drift?So here we have a guy (Adam Driver) who not only knows his poets, he also writes poetry. He's a regular 'Joe', drives a bus, has what you would describe as an artistic wife but otherwise leads a truly regular life. His poems are what I would describe as abstract, they only just rhyme and are very personal. They do however hit home. I hang on his every word when we hear him creating them.What this film does so well is slow everything down. It's like you are in some sort of a time warp. This I think it does deliberately to allow you to see just what surrounds us all the time. The beauty of nature or just the people/relationships we interact with on a daily basis. This, the film does spectacularly well IMHO, the poetry is just a bonus to this. Some of the dialogue does come across as forced (mostly in the bar) but 90% of it is quite believable and natural. Even the dog comes across as quite a character within the 'plot'.Paterson went down very well with me.

138,ExploringFilm,A Haiku of American suburbanite everyday life,8,4 November 2019,"I really liked this film - and in typical Jim Jarmusch style - you are not going to be treated to conflict, intense drama or larger than life characters; rather it is the internal, the small things, the thoughts and moods of an introverted man. This type of filmmaking is sorely lacking these days, and is where film as a more poetic medium seldom actualy shines.Adam Driver plays an amateur poet who works as a bus driver for a living. The work also feeds back into his work, and conversations and encounters he makes during his everyday life serves as inspiration for his poetry. His girlfriend also is of the creative hobby artist kind, but with new projects every week, and an obsession with black and white. Its an acute and realistic observation, I know many of the scatterbrained type well - although this does not really serve as a source of conflict in their relationship, and they share a sort of love, if somewhat distant to each other's thoughts, as both lost in their own creative worlds. Again, this is another fairly acute representation of the reality of a creative couple, where each part pursue their own dream but share rituals such as meals, waking up, breakfasts.Adam's desire to write poetry isn't really touched on. He simply writes a lot, if as a result, he becomes a little distanced to his own world. Personally, I have grown weary of the 'crazy artist genius' stereotype in films, but Adam plays his part subdued and straight-faced. Like in most Jarmusch's films, the dialogue is simple, not complex and baroque, and Adam's makes up for a lot of the emotion that the dialogue is missing. An observer of daily life, he sometimes evesdrops to conversations in a bar, interestingly most of the people he observes are black. Interestingly, the biggest drama that happens in the film is with him as an onlooker, concering a case of unrequited love in a black couple. Although his girlfriend is obsessed with black and white, I don't think Jarmusch is making a racial analogy here, rather it serves as a metaphor for Adam's duality. It also separates him visually from his world, as he as a white man often has the role of an observer of black people.The poetry is presented as text on the screen, and over a series of 'fading montages' that stand out from the rest of the film. The imagery of water shows that his mind is flowing, in motion, and connecting to other parts of the world outside of his everyday world. In the end he is treated to a revelation that I would like to speculate, will only improve his writing. Inspired by real-life William Carlos Williams, a poet of Patterson city, it is an interesting addition to the film. Personally, I find this type of poetry a little prosaic perhaps, but poetry is a written, internal format these days, so it serves well as text on the screen. Also a recurring theme is the appearance of twins in the cast, without a specific relevance to the story. This symbolism serves into making the film a piece of 'hyperreality', or 'poetic reality' as opposed to the more straight-laced kitchen-sink social reality.8/10 from me, some of the scenes felt a little flat or perhaps a little too metaphorical (such as the end scene with the Japaneese man) and overly ponderous. The relationships in the movie could perhaps have been better explored, but I realize Jarmusch's style of filmmaking is much more mood-focused, and also, if you are looking for a type of film you can watch and experience little poignant moments instead of car explisions, this is for you.",Paterson

140,b_trought,"Subtle, multi-layered and one of my favourite films",9,23 August 2021,"Paterson has been on my mind since I first viewed it. Initially I wasn't sure what to make of the slow pace and the repetition, but watching Paterson savouring ordinary (and often repetitive) moments with people I had a feeling that Jarmusch was pointing his film in a specific direction; there is beauty in the mundane, in the banal if you can appreciate it. So like a passenger on Paterson's bus I was content in taking a journey with him.The film is a snippet of one person's life, as he experiences an ordinary week. Unlike many typical Hollywood films there is no starting event, development, conflict and resolution. Instead the film reflects life and we're transported in to the middle of someone's life. There are peculiar people, random occurrences, and sometimes emotionless interactions much the same as in regular life. At times it seems the film is saying nothing and time is simply passing by. But the story is interspersed with poetry, subtly sweet moments and a final act that suggests the universe he exists is willing to help the main character when he falls out of balance.Speaking of the main character, Paterson is almost unwaveringly pleasant throughout. When you feel he is on the brink of loosing who he is then a couple of ""chance occurrences"" help him make sense of what has happened and demonstrate that the pleasant kindness he has carried throughout the film hasn't been unnoticed. I guess this is what we all hope for fundamentally; that we have made a difference by existing, even if we're seldom told.This is one of my main thoughts having just finished watching it for the second time. I'll return to it again in a year or so and it's likely I'll have a different impression of it. Having read others reviews it seems that this is likely to be the case.So I'd suggest watching it with an open mind and maybe something will resonate with you.",Paterson

Gave the film a nice, slightly melancholic, moody feel which I really enjoyed.He lives in an apparently care-free world with his girlfriend, whom is almost of the flip of him: she constantly searches and chases her dreams, spends her days learning the guitar, re-styling their house (rather 'interestingly'), engaging in 'potluck' cooking; while he watches on, slightly amused but never bothered by her foibles, if anything entirely contented and in love.Only when he temporarily cannot write does the character seem to disappear, even in the face of a breathtaking vista, it's the written word that lights him up.A really pleasantly paced film.",Paterson

Throughout the film, I had frisson down the back of my neck. This film made me realize how much I love poetry. I had never realized that I liked poetry, on the contrary, I thought I hated poetry. When the film ended I ran to get my poetry books out and read some of them out loud to myself. This is what cinema is about. It doesn't matter if you like a film or not. If a film makes you feel anything at all, to see from different perspectives and immerse yourself in an imaginary visual and temporal experience that you know it's an illusion from the beginning then the job's done. Jarmusch also always shows how the appreciation of insignificance becomes a soothing state almost like a stoic. I love the feeling of ""afterglow"" of some films. This film has it.

He goes to work, writes poetry during his lunch hour into the one notebook he owns, and then comes home to eat dinner, walk the dog to a neighborhood bar, have one beer, and then go home. The slow, deliberate pace of the movie highlights the repetitive, unspectacular nature of the man's life, but there is one thing that becomes very clear as you watch: he is happy, in his own, quiet way.Paterson, who lives in the city that shares his name, writes poetry into his notebook in the basement of his small home. Next to the small desk on which he writes poetry in his notebook is a small collection of books, including books by William Carlos Williams and David Foster Wallace, which gives us a clue into the major ideas the movie asks us to consider. The man's poetry is also a reflection of these literary influences and also his life, and the appreciation he has for the mundane, small aspects of life that many people ignore or don't even notice. He is consistently decent to people, even if he doesn't show enormous enthusiasm, as his respect for other people, as well as his dog, is presented as a matter of fact that is readily apparent but never asks for praise or even a like response from others. He is kind to strangers as well as to his girlfriend and friends - being especially appreciative of their hopes, dreams and plans, even if some of them sound unrealistic and unproductive.Paterson seems finally shaken by a sudden bit of misfortune near the end of the movie, but in the end he is shown that fate can bring renewal and hope to those who are quietly open to appreciating the beauty and possibilities of even a chance encounter with a stranger that could have easily been avoided or ignored. This movie is an ode to a quiet, modest approach to happiness, and the generosity of spirit that generates and sustains love. Highly recommended. It ain't Jerry Bruckheimer.",Paterson

This one, PATERSON, got an Amazon logo on it, which feels strange to me but is of no relevance, really. Like every poetic film it is open to interpretations on various levels or dimensions of meaning, maybe PATERSON tries to push that as far as it gets, which makes perfectly sense, because its protagonist spends a lot of time writing poetry. No matter if you consider him a bus driving poet or a poetry writing bus driver, he is beautifully embodied by Adam Driver. His performance is one of the most brilliant ones I've seen in years, the way he is acting right on the edge between authenticity and masquerade, between embodiment and ironic distancing, is astonishing. You never know whether his appearance (which seems like a twin to Jarmusch himself in terms of look, language and tonality) is seriously naive in its autistic (anti-)hipster attitude, whether its seriously depressed in its most pathetic, and truthful sense, or whether its just a self-distancing, liberating act of self-irony, desperately screaming not be taken serious. That vagueness can be applied not only to the acting, but to every single cinematic element from story to visual grammar to sound, mean, almost violent in its radical nature. Sometimes it warmed my heart, sometimes it made me almost puke. Almost always it's a perfect match between form and function. And that's all I have to say about PATERSON.",Paterson

159,sosmetallin,Life is beautiful as it is,9,10 April 2017,"Paterson is the story of Paterson, a bus driver in the city of Paterson, played by Adam Driver(personally, I laughed a little). This film is all about his everyday life...just that, really. What we actually see is a week of his life. He has a wife he loves, he goes to work everyday, every evening he goes to the local pub, he writes poems and other stuff ordinary people do. All these things seven times. So...the most boring movie ever? Not really, but (watch out!) if you are not prepared for that, you might find it boring! Nevertheless, Paterson always finds humorous elements in everyday situations, photography and editing make it beautiful to watch, Adam Driver and pretty much everyone's acting (and dialog) in the film is so realistic. Now, talking about ""realistic"", this is exactly where the whole point of the film lies. Among the buzz of all the superhero movies, the big budget blockbusters, even typical dramas and biographies, Paterson comes as a breath of fresh air to tell us what it means to be an ordinary person. And it became crystal clear to me as soon as I watched the ending. Life is beautiful as it is, no need of extra-ordinary coincidences, and even if sometimes something unpleasing happens...life goes on. (9/10) Very good",Paterson
160,robiu013,Refreshing,8,10 January 2017,"Paterson is a movie, that perfectly panders to people with a type of voyeurism, that is still within the borders of social acceptance. It's a movie, that is best described as »slice of life« and that particular slice adds up to an entire week in the life of the titular character and also resident of a town with the same name as him, Paterson. Through him we don't only get to know the Paterson he is, but also the Paterson he lives in. What the movie has to offer, is in a way almost the opposite of what Hollywood does, but rather something you might read in a book. This movie is pretty low-key with it's events and themes, the main character doesn't aim for the skies, but rather struggles to even make sure, whether that's what he really wants. To describe the experience of seeing this in a cinema with only one word; refreshing. Additionally there are many things to praise; from the believable acting to the memorable visuals, as well as integrated poems, that actually feel like something, someone striving to be a poet, would write and last but not least the dialogues, that are both witty and fun but at the same time not too exaggerated to feel comical or cartoony. Yes, Paterson will likely impress the above mentioned still tolerable voyeurists, as well as those, who might interpret the story into something personal. On the other hand the film does have some issues; Writing about events and the weekly routine, might be seen as a cheap trick to stack up content to turn into a feature film. I wouldn't associate Paterson with that however, since all the scenes connect into a bigger picture and play with the major themes of the film even if that's not obvious at first. Additionally I've found minor issues with the characters; Paterson, while acted well and to me personally an interesting character nonetheless, still seemed like too much of a nice guy, making it feel like a cheap trick to make him identifiable and bearable for the long run of a movie, that's lacking big events. Some other characters also felt slightly alien to the otherwise realistic tone of the film, like Paterson's wife with her obsessive-compulsive need to create art or the boyfriend, who couldn't let go. So yes, issues are there, but nevertheless I still consider Paterson one of the better film experiences I had among the 2016-releases and well worth a watch or maybe more.",Paterson

And the wife's, played deliciously by Farahani, melting sweetness in contrast to her husband's direct and unadorned personality is inspired. The coup is the daily evolution of the poems the bus driver writes. They are the engine of the story, a conceit I found so engaging I couldn't bear to miss a line and which is the vehicle for the crisis two thirds through the film.

165,kkokkolatos,What a movie!,9,16 July 2017,"Paterson is a movie with a great pace. Not a fast one, but a deep one. It seems like a movie which explains the way that magic can appear in the simplicity of the routine's life. We see Paterson (Adam Drive) as a very quiet and standared character. He does not talk that much, just short sentences. Although, his eyes look like he is studying life and details of the moment. This spiritual exercise leads him to a very rare and important thing: discovering how every day, no matter how similar is to the last day, hides its very impressing secrets. Secrets which keep you inspired and mentally healthy. His girlfriend is a person who really got me. She felt like a goddess, as her voice was relaxing me and traveled me in a more happy and charming place. She seemed so exotic and smart, made of art and the infinity of colours. She was smart and nice to Paterson, a person that everyone should want to have by his side. Creative and strange in a very charming way. The human relationships are pretty realistic. That's why I felt I could watch this movie for a long time. Because, although it is fiction, seems like a realism that you won't want to leave away. Eventually, you may think that it is actually yourself in the mind palace of the movie.The directing was pretty deep. Not the as good as it could be, but still absolutely interesting. I really liked the colours and the way the director managed to connect images and dialogues. In the end, the film feels like a complete puzzle which, in every piece of it, you can see something that really matters.I also need to say about some very smart and interesting meaning that appear in ""Paterson"".

168,katshapiro,Interesting premise,6,12 August 2018,"Paterson is about the double lives people lead, where art and poetry are bubbling up from underneath the surface of daily routine. Some of the characters corageously (even foolishly, in the case of the actor) wear their art on their sleeve, while others just process it and largely keep it to themselves. In the end, though, it's inescapable: ""Poetry is everywhere, it just needs editing"".The premise is an interesting one, and is rarely explored in any recent cinema. Yet, the dialogue in the movie felt very forced and awkward at times, clearly meant to add style but not substance. The slow pace would have worked if there were fewer ""distractions"" in the form of stylized humour, and more layers of meaning and intent.",Paterson

The Lotus Land appears as samsara ends when the lesson is confirmed that to win is to lose to lose is to win. Even the dog has Buddha Nature...mu! It is a timely vision of happiness available to all who listen to their own inner creative voice whether it whispers to one as: visual, auditory, tactile, fragrant...or a sweet tasting thought to bake and decorate cupcakes. William Carlos Williams and others inspired the beats to write poetry and when i met Allen Ginsberg he inspired me to write and -live- poetry as the Buddhist Masters he spoke of had unfolded in him.

170,Albert_Orr,The poetry of people and places,10,5 August 2016,"Paterson is a celebration of the small details in life. A poetic and charming love-story about a perfectly ordinary couple, living in a perfectly ordinary town. The town in question is Paterson, New Jersey. Home of poet William Carlos Williams, comedian Lou Costello, and one of America's largest waterfalls. The man in question, in true Jarmusch style, is also named Paterson (played with pinpoint subtly by Adam Driver). Paterson is a hard-working bus driver who quietly goes about his duties, all the while allowing the scenery and eavesdropped conversation to inspire his main passion in life; writing poetry. Meanwhile, his girlfriend and the love of his life, played without fault by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, is a stay-at-home creative. She spends her day baking imaginative cupcakes and making new curtains from scratch. The films narrative centres around a seven day week. Each day brings a new variation on the theme, and each moment a reflection on two people who wholeheartedly accept each other for who they are. Paterson is a quiet and contemplative film that sits perfectly in Jarmusch's repertoire. It's a film about how people choose to live their life, regardless of the necessities to work and make money. Like poetry, the words and images flow with little dramatic tension or conflict. Jarmusch explained at Cannes that he intended Paterson to be an antidote to the modern action film, and if this is the case, I'll definitely be coming back for another dose.",Paterson

So unrealistic, so pretentious, this film I had to fast forward through to get to the end without tearing my hair out. The thing that disturbed me most about this is the character of Paterson who is portrayed as a working class, sensitive, good guy but who shows no appreciation for the people around him, his coworker, his bartender and especially including his highly creative and loving wife. The city of Paterson and the job of a bus driver are also completely inaccurately portrayed. Most bus drivers I have ever seen are not riding around cities with light traffic and not dealing with the public including putting a lift down for disabled folks, dealing with difficult customers and the basic chaos of any small or large city. Jarmusch wants to make Paterson, NJ look like some European city while he glosses over the difficulties of the city as life is really lived within it.

178,necid-70967,Poetry,9,24 October 2016,"I owe Jarmusch a debt of gratitude for being a formative figure in shaping my cinematic tastes. I shall never forget watching Stranger Than Paradise (1984) in NY in the early 1980s: the novelty, joy, patient camera movement, the fantastic way of playing Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'I Put a Spell on You' throughout the soundtrack. I have seen most of Jarmusch's movies ever since and more than three decades later, Paterson did not disappoint. Jarmusch is as creative as ever, gifting us with a wonderful film. The set is Paterson N.J., the protagonists are a bus driver also named Patterson and his artistically creative spouse. Paterson writes poetry, reads poetry, and encounters poetry wherever he goes and whoever he meets. This is it. And it is as engaging, uplifting, funny, and as insightful as a film can be. Patterson may be watched as a homage. It delicately portrays a particular place, Paterson New Jersey, reminding us that a place, any place, is always a product of the way its present mixes up with its past, of the way people both walk it and remember it. But the film is not only a homage to a place, it is also a homage to daily life, to the mundanity of just going to work and having a drink after a day's work. One striking feature of this film is that there are no bad characters here, no evil spirits, no mean intentions. In fact the only mean character in the film is the protagonists' dog, but even the dog is not too bad, just a drag. And miraculously, in spite of this, the film is totality innocent of naiveté. As if at the hands of a gifted anthropologist, the camera curiously follows and watches, and the film never falls into anything resembling judgment and condescension. It is truly genius in its ability to draw us into the perspective of the protagonists, to embrace their feelings and movements, to empathize with them and to fall in love with their numerous small encounters. Remarkably, one of the achievements here is that the film feels and looks timeless. It could be shot in the 1950s, or the 1970s, and yet it makes no attempt to hide the fact that it has been shot only recently. Incidentally, Paterson makes a point about not having a mobile phone. It does wonders to the film and its ability to give homage. A truly uplifting film.",Paterson
179,samuelanthonytaunton,"""Without love, what reason is there for anything?"". Paterson - Analysis and Review",7,2 June 2021,"Paterson is a film that reflects upon the banality of daily life while also considering all of its aspects: love, relationships, our dreams and desires, the kindness of strangers, routine, identity, change (you get the gist).Paterson (a nicely subtle performance from Adam Driver) leads an ordinary life; he lives with his wife Laura who is supportive of his daily poetry, wanting him to pursue it further and become one of the greats like William Carlos Williams, a renowned poet from Paterson, New Jersey. This is a significant theme in the film - how can we make a name for ourselves? Can our dreams become a reality? This idea is displayed through Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) who has dreams of becoming a country singer, she's a very artistic individual who paints curtains, dresses, furniture, only in black and white. This 'black and white' can be seen throughout (the old black and white film that Laura and Paterson go to see, the chess board that Doc keeps on the bar, b and w photographs of those who rose to fame from Paterson like Lou Costello) and is also idiomatic for Paterson's ordinary, simplistic life - he wakes up, goes to work, comes home for dinner and then walks the dog to a nearby bar that he visits. This neon-lit bar provides a seemingly small escape for him. The bartender 'Doc' is ironically named as Paterson's regular pint seems to be a cure for whatever troubles the day presented him with (such as his coach breaking down at one point).This is a film about poetry, but not just writing it, the poetics of day-to-day life as well. As a coach driver, Paterson sees a lot of different people come and go. Whilst driving his coach, he likes to listen in on people's conversations, tuning in to his passenger's anecdotes as a source of entertainment. Various close-ups on the coach throughout the film display a motif of shoes, can someone's shoes tell us more about their personality or identity?You can't help but align yourself with Paterson, who, with his various poems that are displayed on-screen, considers all concerns of general life that affect us all. One of his poems looks at time - ""a fourth dimension"" - and the constant checking of his watch is just like any other working-class individual, they wish the day to be over so that they can return home to their loved ones. Despite a very heart-warming relationship between Laura and Paterson, who always wake up embraced in each other's arms, there is perhaps a divide portrayed between those who 'bring home the bacon' and those who are lucky enough to stay at home and carry out their hobbies freely, like Laura.Some characters can even be seen as metaphorical for what the day can bring us. The character of Donny seems to always have a lot of issues on his plate whilst the end encounter with a Japanese poet perhaps symbolises the moments in life where we are given another chance (for Paterson, this is a revived interest in writing poetry after being gifted a new book, following an upset where Marvin the dog had ripped up Paterson's 'Secret Notebook').I found this film a really relaxing and interesting watch and despite not being a follower of poetry, I thought the various snippets of Paterson's life were very relatable. The mundanity of Paterson's life might appear boring to some viewers but as the film isn't plot-heavy, I found myself focusing in on the finer details of what Paterson sees in his life and what these might represent. What really interested me was the discussion between Doc and Paterson, deciding who is the most famous person to come out of the city of Paterson, bringing in the notion of identity and our origins.The film is also very poetically made, realistic cinematography showcases repeated and identical shots of Laura and Paterson waking up throughout the singular week, acting as a leitmotif for how we all get into certain routines.Paterson.

The poetry Adam Driver writes appear on screen in a soft font which is pleasant on the eye, as he reads them out to himself.The whole film is routed in poetry, and is clearly made by people who love the art form, especially the poetry of William Carlos Williams, whose poems are quoted continually throughout the film.

This wasn't only due to the poetic elements, but also down the softly spoken characters and dialogue, the beautifully shot streets and houses and ambling pace of the film. Nothing about this film feels rushed, but at the same time it lingers a lot but never outstays it welcome. The characters are utterly believable, the chemistry between Driver and Fahani tangible and delicate, as they wake up in bed together each morning, signifying a new day.It drew me in very quickly, and after a short while i relaxed back and let the film cast its soft spell on me, leaving me with a warm fuzzy feeling for hours afterwards.",Paterson
195,monty_100,Celebrating the Common Man,9,11 September 2017,"This film is directed by Jim Jarmusch and stars Adam Driver, an actor who has proved to be brilliant with the likes of Girls, Silence and Star Wars. Once again he shines in this role and is in my opinion at his best here.The film is about a guy called Paterson living an ordinary life in Paterson, doing a normal nine to five job. We see him getting up to go to work, driving a bus around the city of Paterson, coming home to his beautiful girlfriend and somewhat cheeky dog, and then getting ready for the next day. This might sound completely boring to some, but this film focuses on the finer details. A conversation between two people on a bus, the awkwardness of sitting next to someone on a park bench and even the same identical lousy dog walk each day. These scenes are all prolonged to give the audience the sense that we are watching in real time, and that none of what we are seeing has been cut or chopped by editors. It all feels real. This film also has a creative side. Paterson is not only a bus driver, but he is a poet. Like most people, Paterson needs an outlet to help him get through each day. Not only that, poetry is his passion. Sometimes people just want to do something for the sake of their own pleasure and not to become the next big thing! This film highlights this very well and with superb taste.This film would shock so many just for the fact that it avoids any sort of drama! Not once is a plane on fire falling through the sky about to crash into his bus. It's celebrates the mundane and should be commended just for avoiding mainstream plot line, regardless if people think the story is slow or boring.Overall this film is not only fantastic but refreshing. It shows us that the smaller things in life are really worth living for, and you don't have to be famous or front page news to get where you want to be. Some people are content with living life in the background. Nothing wrong with that if you ask me.",Paterson

There is no hint of comedy in this film and the romance is just dead. 
There is no plot to this film, it just drags on with repetitive scenes...like why are we supposed to care about any of these characters.
I was excited to see this film had a 7.4 overall rating and 90 on the metascore. But how on earth has that happened? How did anyone enjoy this film?

201,gabrielferreiraestanislau,simple but very good,9,3 April 2020,"Parterson shows us the daily life of a man, who always wakes up at the same time, does the same things every day. Paterson does not propose to have twists, it is simple, it is what we are watching and will not be more than that, with repetitive events that the plot presents us, all this makes it seem that the film is not good and well tedious, but far from it, paterson has always kept me attentive to events, whether repetitive or not. Adam Driver is an excellent actor, and in paterson he demonstrates this, together with Golshifteh Farahani they make scenes where he can perceive a very realistic intimacy of a couple. Beautiful photography, with the beautiful scenery that the city of paterson offers. Note 9",Paterson

203,skazellena,Deep,8,14 January 2020,"No doubts, Adam Driver is one of the best actors in this generation. In contrast to his most famous character Kylo Ren, in this film he plays the role of Paterson who is quiet, thoughtful and writing brilliant and deep poetry. ""Paterson"" is telling the story of a bus driver who lives in Paterson (the town) with his wife who is extremely opposite to him. While he goes to work every day and comes home at the exact same time as the day before, she is a chef, an artist or a designer. It depends on the day.
With watching Jim Jarmusch's Paterson you're getting to know the story of two persons who could not be more different but who are also deeply in love and just happy with their situation.",Paterson
204,gaurirm,Film as a Poetry.,8,30 July 2020,"I love this movie, it's quite simple yet deep. It shows the routine of a man called Paterson, who is a driver by profession & a poet by heart. He lives in Paterson, New Jersey with his wife Laura who is a homemaker. She is very creative and bubbly in contrast to her husband who is stoic & reserved.
Paterson loves to write poems, & in the span the movie plays through the lens of his routine, (a week) he cherishes his wife Laura (his muse) by dedicating a love poem to her. He also notices the little things around him, & loves to write by a waterfall in Paterson.
This movie might not be for viewers who expect a 'plotful' or an exciting movie... This movie soothes the viewers and puts them in a contemplative state.
I love Adam Driver & his performances, Paterson is no different.PS. The movie has a pet dog owned by the couple. He may or may not play a key role in the movie. Haha.",Paterson
205,holo17,Overrated?,5,12 September 2018,"I have no idea why this film is so acclaimed. Sure, it is pleasant enough, and the point it's trying to make is understandable and relatable. But unless the acting of Driver and Farahani is purposefully awkward, it's actually pretty bad. Some of the lines are also quite cringey, to the point of being painful to watch. However, the ending makes up for the remainder of the movie quite a bit. This is supposed to be a quiet representation of everyday life, but I hope nobody actually acts this stiff and speaks that mindlessly clichéd in their day-to-day activities.",Paterson

The acting was atrocious, the poetry was HORRIBLE (the best poem was the one written by the ten-year-old girl) and the only humor was the main character's Indian boss, which seemed completely misplaced since there was virtually no humor anywhere else.I seriously think this is just a prank on movie reviewers to see if they will pontificate over the deeper meaning of it all, when it reality it was an elaborate joke.I gave an extra star because the dog was super cute and funny.",Paterson

There is no plot. The point of the movie is to enjoy little things. I didn't see anyone in this movie enjoying anything. They just live their boring routines and their lives seem so miserable.
I don't live extremely fun life by myself but I can say that I know what it means to notice little things in life. This characters seem like the would rather be dead then live at all.
Also, main characters have some really stupid moves. They made me mad with some of their decisions and actions that I was actually shocked.

He seems quite depressed to me, but I don't know is he even aware of that. Only his poems are holding him together.And then dog eats his poem book. On animal level what dog meant by doing that (beside being spoilt by his owner, the girl) is to tell Paterson to not be submissive and grow a pair.First, he's supposed to acknowledge that he doesn't like the girl and that she's suffocating him (that's his fault). Break up with her, move to another town and try a different job. To let soul out of the cage. Let time pass, examine the past relationship, learn from mistakes, find another woman.In that scenario I bet his poems would be completely different.Thanks.",Paterson

Am I really meant to find a man who leaves his dog outside a bar every night rather than taking him for a walk endearing? Apparently he is crazy in love with his kooky wife, yet he leaves her alone at home EVERY night to sit in a dive bar talking nonsense?As for his so called 'poetry' ...... well, it was rubbish like the rest of his dull life.

A sad man with a stupid girlfriend (really stupid) spends his days, one after one in a slow path to the void of his existence. Paterson is not a film. The dog is sad. The girlfriend is sad and without brain. The barman is an old man. There is an actor who doesn't know what is love. The bus is old. The boss is unlucky. There is not rhythm. There is no plot.

The entire ensemble cast is excellent, but Adam Driver stands out for his portrayal of the main character. It's essentially a poem on film by Jim Jarmusch!

216,czarownikiwanow,"Rather boring mix of Ghost Dog, Permanent Vacation and Night on Earth",3,2 January 2017,"Jarmush failed to combine best concepts of his three best movies into one picture. I'm very sorry to tell, that this movie is not original, quite boring and most of all doesn't feel like Jarmush at all. Unfortunately in many scenes he just lays cards on the table, so viewer will know what will be happening in few minutes. But not in raising- tension-way, rather in oh-my-god-what-is-he-doing way. those scenes are exceptionally tawdry. Some scenes were just took straight out of Ghost dog and played by different actors. Best music, which was always Jarmush's signature (Amazing music by RZA in Ghost Dog, and Tom Waits in Down by the Law) in Paterson is rather poor. I cannot see this afflation, which others can see. On the bright side: Locations are finely chosen, movie is nearly-beautiful, when it comes to photos. I was confused and disappointed when I left cinema. People, in theater, were laughing, like in sitcom. If You were touched by old Jarmush movies, and they play important role in your life, you shouldn't see this one. It is simply bad for You",Paterson
217,Prince_Sid,I highly recommend Paterson because it is a masterpiece.,10,26 February 2017,"Paterson is a perfect film. It is my favourite film of 2016. It is a very engaging character study.Adam Driver gives a spellbinding performance. His each expression tells a story. Paterson is the story of a bus driver who happens to be a poet.The whole movie takes place over a week of his life. It accounts the small moments and incidents that happens to him during this period.It may seem ordinary but it is these moments that life is made up of. You can relate to that character. He is such a magnetizing character that when it ends,you start missing him.You become a part of his life and he become a part of yours.Paterson is a movie made with so much affection and tenderness that it reflects on the screen. Go watch it now. P.S. I have found out that Paterson is a largely unseen film.It was neglected in the awards season too.That makes me very sad.This is the type of movie that is made no more in Hollywood or anywhere else. At a time when mindless CGI and action movies has taken over the film industries all over the world, movies like Paterson should be encouraged. That is one of the reasons I wrote this review.",Paterson
218,phutcheson-48844,Boring waste of time,4,1 February 2017,"This has got to be the most uneventful, boring film I have seen in a while. There are some interesting characters and Adam Driver is good, but the story is just about as dull as watching paint dry. Maybe I am missing the point or this is supposed to have hidden meaning and make a statement, but all I can say is that statement was lost in the dull dialogue and non- event events. I was left wondering what was the point of the film other then to highlight the mundane existence of some people. The problem is that I cannot see this as a normal life without the character getting put on medication for depression.After Rogue One, I was expecting much more from Driver. Do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD on this one, if you must see it at all. I wish I could get the time back that I wasted watching this snooze fest.",Paterson

To take a quick peek, just to find out how other people live, what decisions they make, if their lives are different, better than ours. The grass in always greener on the other side. Is it, though? I watched 'Paterson' on my wave of watching everything there is with Adam Driver. I did not expect much since I'm more a fantasy/ action/ controversy fan and 'Paterson' is most definitely none of these. I thought I would get bored in the middle and give up. Surprisingly, not only was I not bored but I really enjoyed the film. It's amazing how much meaning you can find in an ordinary life, how much poetry and love. The film is deeply true, showing people with their flaws and routines. There is this average married couple, she's a house-wife with passion (overwhelming!) for black and white patterns and cupcakes, he's a bus driver devoted to his daily routine and fighting it by creating poems. Boredom, right? Yet, there's peace and consolation in the happiness they found, in harmony of their relationship, in silent devotion and gentle smiles they share, in poetry of repetitive situations. You can't find unusual here, you won't see grand gestures, they're nothing but typical. But after watching the film, you might realize that typical and average is also right, good and real.

He seems multi-talented, can play different characters, although most have similar personalities. I am also a fan of ""Indie"" type movies. This movie is just missing something. (actually a lot of things)I was surprised to see the numerous glowing reviews of this movie. It just kind of makes me think people are trying to be artsy and elitist, and anyone who doesn't ""get"" the movie is just uncultured. No, sorry. You can try to spin this waste of time any way you want, and say ""it's for the poetry,"" etc. It might have worked as a one of those 15 minute shorts because you wouldn't expect what you would out of a TWO HOUR movie.Sorry Adam, but you're better than this.",Paterson

It's a boring character, in a boring town, married to a crazy person, who owns a dog that he hates and drives a bus. NOTHING HAPPENS. I've seen reviews that say the ""beauty is in the details"". Maybe. But it's a very deeply boring and annoying film for those of us who are not fans of poetry for the sake of poetry. I like slow films, I like old films, I enjoy independent films very much and I like a certain kind of poetry (classical to be specific).

236,hsiljak,Excuse me AHA!,9,18 December 2016,"On our way out of the cinema, we discussed how jarmuschy this piece was. She said it's so like Broken Flowers, while I thought it was like Coffee and Cigarettes. It doesn't matter much, though: Paterson is a tour de force on its own.Once you let the recurring motives (don't make me list them!) carry you through the story, you're in for a great bus ride through a life of two beautifully different characters and their dog with a character of its own, dog without which the plot wouldn't roll (some writers and directors are unable to develop human characters to the extent Jarmusch develops Marvin). The contrast of Paterson (you have to love the name of man living in Paterson, NJ, in William Carlos Williams's very own Paterson, NJ) and Laura is almost the black and white contrast of her creations: she chases different manners of expression almost the way gamblers chase luck, waiting to become someone big tomorrow, while he takes it easy, it comes to him. While his life routine may come off as boring and unpoetic, it gives birth to inspiration and creations (and the Japanese poet rightfully notes the poeticity of it).There is some W. R. Williams, Wallace (ah, Infinite Jest at one point, camera catches the volume of Infinite Jest on the shelf, cutting it and making the title FINITE JEST), Jean Dubuffet and Frank O'Hara in the film, but the best poetry shown is the visual one, written in celluloid. Just like Paterson was Williams's epic poem, this Paterson is Jarmusch's metapoem on the poet living in the world of matches and molecules, poet with a genuine need to write.Two sentences from the final part of the film followed me home: It's just words and One line could be enough. How simple it sounds from the mouth and the pen of the poet, be it Paterson or Jarmusch himself how true it is for them, and how false it is for us, the untalented poem-eaters.Back to the technicalities, there's not much to say except to bow. The shots, especially ends of sequences are marvellous. Music feels like it grows from the celluloid, while the script is so smooth, with the comic relief coming to the rescue sometimes to keep us from ourselves. The cast is extremely well-chosen. After About Elly, I didn't have doubts about Golshifteh Farahani and Star Wars: The Force Awakens didn't make me change opinions on Adam Driver (actor): they were more than capable to carry the poem on their shoulders.Yes, it's a poem; not a story.

What makes it all worse is that what was the grand finale was so easily predicted almost in the first half of the movie.That being said, the reason why i am not giving this abomination a 1 star is that it had some good things about it. I do commend all of the members of the cast, i believe they did what they could with the little they were given, the cinematography and the music were fine as well. I liked certain aspects of the poetry despite the fact that it felt forced at times.Now, to the horrible part.The only thing more annoying than the girlfriend/wife character was the grunting dog, man what a poorly written character that woman was, ditsy , childish, boring, could actually be suffering from OCD and very very unlikable.Adam drivers character ""paterson"", was remarkably boring , the character is in no way special , men like this do exist and are quite difficult to handle.",Paterson

The wife dreams of becoming rich and famous. The husband is smart, generous, loves poetry and seems content with his life in a small town. The movie depicts an ordinary week of their lives. Just as in real life, nothing major happens, only a few minor events. One of the scenes that I found poignant and sad was the husband's conversation with the 10 year old poet girl.

243,victoria-cherunova,It's a beautiful world where a bus driver likes Emily Dickinson.,10,22 January 2017,"Paterson lives a perfect life of an artist - it's timeless, it's romantic, it's poetic. It is not ""objective reality"" that an uneventful life of a bus driver in a small town can present: a gray boring suburban town where even crimes never turn out real, a simple monotonous, low-paid job, family or health problems that others can experience. It is not Paterson's reality, he chooses a different life.Everyday he wakes up (not because alarm wakes him) to kiss a perfectly beautiful woman who tells him a wonderful dream. Artistic herself, she is a perfect muse for an artist, with exotic looks and foreign accent. She shapes their surroundings where everything matches in color and pattern: his clothes, bed sheets, even matches. Even words match all the time. The box he carries everyday contains lunch she prepared for him and a photo of hers that is different everyday. She is caring, loving, and supportive; her only concern is preservation of his poetry. Her only flaw, perhaps, was a surprise pie she made with cheese and brussels sprouts. Everyday as he goes to work, he enjoys a picturesque view. And every morning before driving his bus he writes poems in his secret notebook. He enjoys driving a bus because he can listen to people's conversations. He is not concerned about money, and chooses not to have a smartphone because he doesn't want to, not because it's expensive. Unlike his coworker, he has nothing to complain about. The only cause of Paterson's problems is his wife's dog. Everyday day it bends over Paterson's mail box stand, for example, with an attempt to annoy him. But he is patient and even manages to make his evening walk with the dog enjoyable as he can drop into a bar for a beer. The dog, however, is the real danger that can shatter his ideal life, at the core of which is poetry. If he meets another girl, it would be a 10 year old one who writes her own poetry. If he witnesses a crime about to happen, the reason would be unrequited love, and the gun would be a toy one. And if something happens to his secret notebook, he would meet a stranger who would appear out of nowhere and sit on the same bench, where Patterson would sit. And the stranger from a faraway land would happen to love poetry too, and he would happen to have a bag full of poetry notebooks. And, of course, he would give Patterson a new notebook as a gift which would inspire him to write again. And everything will be fine, forever. Because it's a beautiful world, in which a bus driver likes Emily Dickinson.",Paterson
244,ciaran-k95,This Is Just to Say (This Film Is Fantastic),8,20 July 2017,"In Paterson, we follow the day-to-day routine of local Paterson bus driver and amateur poet, Paterson (Adam Driver). His alarm-less morning wake up; the conversations he overhears on the bus; returning home to his eccentric partner; his nightcap in the local bar. We witness all of these things, along with the subtle nuances each new day brings.The beauty in this film is rooted in its structural allusionism to the understatedness and simplicity of a William Carlos Williams poem, stopping short of actually being an homage. Since Broken Flowers, Jim Jarmusch's pivot towards more mainstream cinema has been a wonderful success, this film being no exception.A relaxed film with some barely perceivable touches of Coen Brothers- esque occultism, courtesy of a pug and several pairs of twins, watch Paterson and be reminded of the simple pleasures of everyday life.",Paterson
245,shaman9811,Beauty of Ordinary,10,6 August 2018,"I really love calm movies about introvert, ordinary lives so much. This movie shows you the ordinary life you live, and this thing is both sad and peaceful to me. It's sad because I want a change, I want a difference in my life and I'm bored of the same days that follow each other. But there will be more ""empty pages"" in my life and those pages can ""presents more possibilities"". Right? And it's peaceful because I don't know why but there are powerful, beautiful, meaningful things that every usual thing we do every day can bring. Yes, as I said it was both sad and peaceful but it made me focus on positive things. The joy of little things and the little things they bring. This movie didn't teach me this, but showed me and made me feel this. And I need that feeling in my life. I need to remember that time to time. I think it's more important to show things to someone, to make someone feel somethings than tell them. And this movie is definitely doing that. There are more things to say about the feelings and such things but generally these are my favorite points about the movie I think.I generally talked about feelings, but if I speak technically; it has a beautiful cinematography and locations and scores. I'll definitely continue to listen to the scores. While writing. While thinking. Or just because I want to listen.I watched this movie because of Jim Jarmusch by the way. I watched Only Lovers Left Alive (one of my favorite movies of all time) and I saw that he's an original and a different director and writer. Then I decided to watch his other movies. Then I watched Stranger Than Paradise. And now here I am.",Paterson
246,stefangerhaeusser,"Paterson, a breath of fresh air that falls flat on its face",3,4 May 2017,"If you're tired of Hollywood and its reliance on a similar narrative structure for most of their film, Paterson can be a breath of fresh air for audiences, but if you enjoy Hollywood's basic three act structure and stories that have a lot of conflict and clear goals for each character you may despise this film. Paterson is a film about a bus driver/poet who goes through their daily life. I commend the Writer/Director of Paterson Jim Jarmusch takes multiple risks with this film to show a week in the life of Paterson played by Adam Driver, but just because Jim Jarmusch takes risks with this film doesn't make this a great film and here is why. Paterson's story structure is summed up by mundane moments mixed together with an awkward ""poetic"" moments to justify and add and ""artistic"" angle to these moments. The tone of the film is very similar to Judd Apatow's Netflix series Love with its very slow pace and use of awkward character reactions. Patterson tries to be artistic and poetic but fails in multiple ways. The poetry sections seemed like it was added as an after thought to get people to relate to this rather boring character. This causes me to not care about the two most important scenes in the film, the first scene being towards the end when Paterson's girlfriend dog eats his poetry book. Jim Jarmusch may have intended for the book to have a heavy emotional significance in pre production but the book to me becomes annoying and I end up cheering that the dog ripped apart the book. For me to cheer about the only moment of conflict in the film makes this an unsuccessful film. A character living their daily life without conflict is not a story it's a couple of beautiful shot strung together without any substance or backbone. There is no rising action and no goals for any characters in this film except for the random couple who fight in the bar scenes. This lead me to question why I would waste my time watching a movie essentially about nothing, sprinkled with ""art"" in a last-ditch effort to add some emotional weight to Patterson. Patterson is an experimental film to say the least but it does have moments where it shines. From a production stand point, the different set ups and locations in this film is impressive especially for an independent film. The film is also shot well especially in any of the bus sequences. The sound design is not bad, as well as the on set recording of sound is really clear even for locations that you think would be a disaster for sound like a moving bus. But theses all don't matter if you cannot connect with your characters and they feel like they just exist to exist. That could be a metaphor Jim Jarmusch tried to convey and if that is the case please warn me beforehand because I already exist to exist I do not need to watch someone else doing the same thing.Patterson could have been a very artistic and good movie if there was substance to the characters, story and poetry. If Jim Jarmusch had put more significance to Patterson's love for poetry for instance, if he liked poetry so much he decided to quit his job to pursue poetry fully and it causes a ripple in his relationship, that is a story. If Patterson fought for his poetry at the end when it was ripped apart, Patterson would have more dimension as a character. But instead Paterson gives up on poetry and pretty much waits until an unmotivated scene where a stranger give him a notebook to write poems in because some how he knew Patterson was a poet. I like the idea of a stranger having a significance in your life because I have had multiple time where my life has been change because of a talk with a stranger and or a kind gesture. But this moment in the film feel unrealistic because it was like this stranger was psychic, he immediately sits down next to Patterson and talks about Poetry. For a film that's main purpose and best thing about itself is to be realistic, this moment at the end was almost comical because it was far from realistic. This felt like a cheap and unsatisfying way to end the movie. Which sums up how Patterson is a unique movie but falls flat from its potential to tell a realistic and artistic story.",Paterson

Paterson is a movie about art, inspiration, love, humor, struggle, loss and hope, pieced together with ... poetry. It is a movie about what it means to be an artist in the modern world, in our world.The movie captures the spontaneity, normality and routine of life and it is not trying to be grandiose nor boring, on the contrary it is honest, personal, intimate and touching. Every scene, every frame, every line of dialogue, every melody was arranged to make you feel that way, elegantly packed, just like a poem.I don't want to tell you about the story and I don't want you to read about it, if you like poetry, if you enjoy art and interested in witnessing an instance of it being shaped in front of your eyes, then go watch the movie, when you will leave the theater you will be different from the person who entered.",Paterson

Every segment is the beginning to a conflict that could itself spiral into a film of its own. Such is life.

Sorry, but this was just a total waste of time.As for Adam Driver - this actor has one single expression that he maintains consistently throughout the entire film. The best thing about the film was the superbly beautiful actress Golshifteh Farahani, who did a decent job of playing a moronic character obsessed with boring artwork. Farahani's art and Driver's poetry was so terrible that it was laughable, was that the joke?

As for the Story, there isn't much to say about it , the whole thing is filled with lots of irrelevant,repetitive and self-conscious bull****. the characters seem to be out of place and nothing really fits together.

I can appreciate that the filmmaker was trying to be artistic, but so much of the film relied on images of people sleeping or sitting or on the never- ending rambling of awful poetry being recited, and those long, uneventful moments made for an extremely tense and awkward movie theater experience. Sitting in the cramped quiet listening to my neighbors cough and praying for some on screen action made for a very regrettable two hours of my life, and effectively killed any meaning this story might have been trying to provoke. The characters in the film were likable enough, but the majority of comic relief came from spontaneous shots of the family's dog being adorable. By the end of the movie, I wanted to punch each of the characters in the face, except for Jared Gilman's, who is far too talented to be relinquished to an unnamed part in a lifeless film.

This time I heard loud and clear when Paterson said how much Laura understood him. And she really did.

They don't push each other, they wait, hold hands and talk solemnly. They are silent when they know words just cramp up the space. Laura's love for Peterson is love Peterson writes about.

275,migrantworker,A poetic fairy tale - or a horror story?,7,2 March 2019,"I watched this film first time alone and second time with my wife. First watching left me in a mellow and fairly content mood: a film with likeable characters, no conflicts, no violence. But there was something inexplicable, something I could not point my finger at.
After the second watching and extensive discussions with my wife (to whom I owe much of this review) I am seeing this film as a story of people, whose lives are somewhere else. Nobody in this film is revealing his or her feelings - except Everett but then, he is an actor and we do not know, whether he is acting or not as he is expressing his love. Paterson and Laura exchange words but never discuss. Laura is portrayed as perhaps lovable but utterly superficial and she is seen working on the surface of curtains, clothes and cupcakes. Even the looks of her new guitar seem to be more important than its sound. We witness Laura baking and learning to play guitar but both activities are instrumental, offering her the opportunity for money or fame. She praises Paterson for his poetry but she seems more infatuated with the idea of poetry than his poems; in fact, I got the impression that she had never read any of his poems. Paterson recites two poems for her: one was by William Carlos Williams and the other by the girl he met by accident, none of his own poems.
Paterson listens to people discussing but he does not want to be engaged in any discussions. These discussions seem to be about local heroes (Costello, the anarchist etc) who were able to get away from the town of Paterson, unlike characters in the film. When two young men were actually discussing their own lives and encounters with girls, we learn that both of them were too scared to do anything that would have changed their lives. When one of the characters, Donny the bus depot supervisor, directly tells him of his life and his problems, Paterson doesn't seem to be at all interested. When Paterson goes to the bar to drink his daily beer, he sits by the counter, instead of sitting with the other customers, although he probably knows everyone pretty well.
So a film about ordinary but lovable people and poetry in mundane details turned out to be a horror story about people, who are afraid of their own shadows and who exchange platitudes instead of communicating with each other.",Paterson
