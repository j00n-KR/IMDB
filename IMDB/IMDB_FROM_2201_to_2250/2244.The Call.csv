0,Leofwine_draca,A premise that works,7,30 November 2020,"THE CALL is an intriguing Korean thriller with a time travel based premise. It appears to be based on another movie and it has stylistic similarities to other movies such as FREQUENCY, but where this film excels is in the style, with lots of good acting, direction and choreography that continually impresses. It's the kind of film that has a straightforward plot with a big twist you can see coming a mile off, but the journey is so gripping that it doesn't matter. The two actresses, from #ALIVE and BURNING, are both very good in their roles and the film never lets its grip of suspense let up until the very end. It's not always convincing, but it does always remain watchable.",The Call
1,kosmasp,Never mind logic,8,28 November 2020,"It's the suspense that keeps the movie going. And for a first feature length outing ... kudos to the director of this. Now I've recently seen a spanish movie on netflix that was sort of similar (with parallel timelines or whatever you want to call them). It struggled too with making sense or being able to explain how things would be able to change and affect any future while the main character seemed to remember everything that didn't actually happen.But that is why I started with never mind logic. Because there is no explanation for that and the movie can not deliver one. While the spanish movie was more romantic though in its approach, this is evil and gets down and dirty. We can feel early on, that something is off ... but how would you react and what would you do? There are so many things character wise that make this exciting and the suspense level is as high as it can get ... again, if you let it do what it does ... Twists and all that included ... even the one within the credits ...",The Call
2,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Slick and stylish but troubling psycho/thriller,9,30 December 2020,"Trying to locate her lost phone, a woman inadvertently finds herself on the phone with a woman who lived in the house decades earlier and begins a relationship with her over the phone-calls, but when this gradually changes their relationship she goes to extremes to get back to the status quo which threatens everyone around her.Overall, this one manages to be wholly entertaining. One of the best attributes is the engaging start-up that offers a fantastic mystery to look into as she starts the search for her missing phone. The frantic quest to find it leads nicely from the mysterious calls inquiring about someone who doesn't live there to the discovery of the boarded-up room inside the house. Even getting to see how it happened with the incident in the past with the burning room to the phone conversations here which comes off in a novel manner as the girl realizes the hidden connection they have with each other starts the film in a rather impressive manner. Moreover, that causes the start of the strangeness to begin amplifying considerably. Not only does she manage to use their meetings to help her overcome her insecurities and change the past she had in her diary, but those changes are also shown to pay dividends in the future timeline. Even though she gets her parents to return and they share music and new from the future with each other, the shift in their connection through the changes that have been wrought meaning no time for each other to talk anymore causes cracks in the foundation of their relationship. The resulting snap and series of challenges that are in place during the finale are fun, creative and pack a nice punch throughout here, giving the film a lot to like. There are some slight issues with this one. One of the main issues is the film's insistence on adhering to the usual trials and tribulations that are usually found.in time-travel films that belie any sense of how that works. The idea of moving along through time and focusing on past efforts chasing the present means that the various situations and encounters should have already been a fixture of their lives in the change. Getting scalded with water to the point of a permanent burn on their body or complete room rearranging shouldn't be shown taking place in the present, it would've already been second nature as the timeline has been altered to those changes being the new standard. The characters would've had no knowledge or memory of the incidents, and the discrepancies in the storyline stand-out due to that. The finale also stands out for making everything complex and confusing. The continuance of the inability to pay attention to the time-travel conundrums not only allows this one to feel incredibly flimsy in terms of why she snapped but also alters the timeline of the events. These changes are never given any kind of explanation and just seem to exist solely to serve as surprise shocks. This becomes apparent, especially once things dip into the post-credits work which is where the most egregious aspects occur by tacking on too many explanations and extraneous circumstances to feel like overkill after the third extra scene. The film would've been fine cutting at the credits instead of continuing with the post-credits scenes, and overall these issues really lower this one.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Call
3,phd_travel,Hard to follow the story,5,11 December 2020,"Any Psh fan will want to see this horror movie. There is an interesting 2 time periods communicating with each other and alter the future thing. Although if you think hard the premise doesn't make much sense. It doesn't help that the direction isn't clear. Hard to follow what was going on.PSH acts well as does her co star.
The ending is notorious for being irritating.",The Call
4,trashgang,totally overhyped and not my cup of tea,5,6 January 2021,"You have to see this, the flick on flix, wow, what the hell was all that people were talking about. And by know I promised myself never to watch a trailer and go blind into a flick. As I did with this one.The only thing I heard that you needed to se eit for the effects used. And I agree, the effects used here and there are indeed way above mediocre but effects doesn't make a movie as we see here. The story I can dig but why o why does flicks have to clock in over 90 minutes nowadays.By now you do know I wans't into The Call. A lot of blah blah over the, sigh, phone and nothing really happening. Sure, there is blood here and there and some awkward situations with some devilsih doing but overall it was a let down for me. Hyped again by Netflix and by a lot of people on all social media, do not count me in.

5,deloudelouvain,Another hit from South-Korea.,8,22 January 2021,"South-Korean cinema, it's just the best you can get from Asia. They for sure know how to make good movies and Kol (or The Call for the English title) is one of them. I'm always very sceptical when I watch a movie from Asia, but when it's Korean it's just different, they don't overact like we're normally used to when it comes from another Asian country. And they do know how to write interesting stories. In Kol there's an intriguing plot, one where you have to stay really concentrated to follow as it is a bit twisted, but it's certainly entertaining. The acting was perfect and that from the whole cast. I read other reviewers stating the ending was disappointing and in a way I get it because it causes confusion, but when I thought about it a bit more it wasn't that bad, but it's clear the movie was just one minute too long. That said its another hit from Korea, the list of good movies from over there is getting really long now. I guess I will have to follow director Chung-Hyun Lee as I'm sure he will make other great movies.",The Call
6,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Unleash the beast.,8,29 November 2020,"As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10",The Call
7,ops-52535,a film aint over...,10,15 February 2021,"Until its over is the only negative i can come up with because it seems never ending. its a psychological drama horror film , a real timebending experience between wormhole passages that communicates with oldies goldies handheld telephones. i cant help it but i lost some dimension of time here and there, and deserve a 2 look to encode the sublime messages sent between the caracters, but a very intense psychopathic show where you will have to move your sympathy many a time. so if you wanna change your history just call 777.........acting and production and score are top division, and its just a short message from the grumpy old man, its a must see and a recommend",The Call
8,marmar-69780,The Call,6,2 December 2020,"The Call was a fine Korean thriller that had some very good concept and idea but i felt also like that idea could be explored and used in a little better ways then it was.Characters were little uninteresting to and i wasnt able to connect with them but they had some fine conversations over phone in beginning when they were more friendly and towards middle when staff started to change a bit and film turned into a horror.Story was like i said very unique and cool and im not sure if we ever seen something similiar on paper ,but execution was to messy to make it work",The Call
9,jtindahouse,Love the concept and love the ending - even if it doesn't entirely add up,8,2 December 2020,"I'm a big fan of the concept behind 'The Call'. It is similar to the 2000 film 'Frequency', only with a much darker plot. And don't underestimate me calling it dark, this film is seriously dark. Every Korean film I watch seems to have no fear whatsoever of taking risks. While so many American films, even horror ones, play it by the book and keep it safe, the Koreans seem to have no book - and I love it.When you involve any sort of time travel or intersecting time periods in a movie things are going to get complicated. For the most part things play out pretty simply in 'The Call'. It is easy to follow and everything seems to follow similar logic. Then the end comes around and everything blows up in that regard. I've done some thinking about it and watched an explanation video and my conclusion is that it doesn't all quite add up. I absolutely love the ending they went for, but it doesn't make 100% sense when you go back and think about the steps it took to get there. Be your own judge though when you watch it I suggest.We don't see a lot of female villains or serial killers in film. I absolutely love that 'The Call' chooses to go that route, and it does it so well. The villainous character in this film is extremely menacing and captivating to watch. There is no reason more films couldn't take on this challenge. I had a really good time with 'The Call' and would absolutely recommend it as one to check out.",The Call
10,joiningjt,"Great movie confusing ending, but worth watching!!",8,28 November 2020,I'm still trying to figure out the ending and I read all the reviews nobody else got it either. The movie is great until the end everything makes sense and then they confused me with the ending. The movie is soooooo good until then it's a solid 8.,The Call
11,Pairic,"Horror, Time Twists,",8,4 December 2020,"The Call: South Korean film which mixes genres, Horror, Time Travel (sort of), Serial Killer. Two women are in communication via telephone but one lives in 1999, the other in 2019. The past is changed as is the future through their actions and sharing of information. Deaths are undone or delayed, more deaths occur, the protagonists' material circumstances change in front of our eyes, people vanish as the changes wrought means they died years ago. Their contact also results in the creation of a serial killer. We also get a shaman thrown in for good measure. Some really disturbing and violent scenes with a growing atmosphere of dread as the narratives. develop. The differing and changig times periods and the resulting paradoxes are well handled. Written and Directed by Lee Chung-hyun. On Netflix. 8/10.",The Call
12,andrewchristianjr,GOOD ONE.,7,6 September 2021,"This movie starts off slow, but you built an attachment to the characters. At the beggining its a fun happy movie but slowly after the girl from the future does a favor from the girl in the past things go sour.",The Call
13,zhyarTheChosen,Welll hear me out,7,17 October 2021,I really liked the beginning because it they add no unnecessary part to make it longer. The middle of the movie with the sad part and the actin with they new type of story was so good but the ending was terrible.,The Call

16,Xstal,Ending Makes Perfect Sense...,7,8 December 2020,"... because without it you can't make Call 2, 3 and 4 - and if you've accepted the events leading up to the close out you pretty much have to accept anything can happen, at any time, with little or no rhyme or reason, evidence or justification. If you can take it for what it is and don't try to examine its flaws too deeply, can wallow in its shallows recognising that certain genres, having been milked close to extinction, can still give rise to originality - you'll be thoroughly entertained, albeit feeling a little short changed when the credits begin to roll at the end.",The Call
17,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Twisty South Korean horror,6,2 December 2020,"The beginning starts out boring, but the action picks up. Don't stop the movie at the ending credits because it has a surprise ending shortly after the end credits begin to roll.",The Call
18,kuarinofu,How to mess up your own film,4,13 February 2021,"First of all, I have to admit that the film looks beautiful, the cinematography is great, the color correction is top-notch. Overall, the production is nice and even though the product placement can get a little invasive at times, it still doesn't diminish the amount of effort that was put into this film.Sadly, this is the only positive thing I can say about this film. They had an interesting concept and some of the scenes are nice and tense, but the writing is so forced it literally bends time. The concept of time is not even mutilated, it is straight-up butchered in the film several times. At some point, your questioning brain will just hit a wall and the only thing you can say is ""whatever"". This film really requires the viewer to buy a lot of things, heavy suspension of disbelief is required, but still won't help. I still can't figure out how these two parallel timelines can possibly work in the way they did it in the film.The cherry on top is, obviously, the post-credit nonsense (and also a random cut-in that made no sense but it does if you watch past the credits). I guess you can still buy it just because of the mess they did with the concept of time, but it only makes the film so much worse. I would still rate the film so much higher if the ending wasn't just stupid and made the film pointless (only to ensure possible sequels).Good general premise, great production, horrible mess of a story, and a post-ending that I cannot reverse by calling the director through time.",The Call
19,SoumikBanerjee25,"One of the Best Thriller, that I have ever witnessed!",9,17 February 2021,"With an awe-inspiring concept, ""The Call"" makes you earnestly invested right from the onset. While dealing in difficile Time Paradox theories; it delivers in every desired aspects!
One more indelible offering from the Korean film industry!Keeping my privy obsessions about Time conjectures aside, I am astounded at how great the overall execution was. Being someone who just begun delving into Korean celluloid in general; this has been a stupendous encounter!Outside of its promising conceits, even as a full-fledged thriller; it effortlessly enthuses in all attainable departments. From an affluent set of technicalities to its dainty enactments,
It is undoubtedly an all-rounder of sorts. Speaking of Performances, Park Shin-Hye & Jeon Jong-Seo as two central characters; make hefty contributions in their respective parts.And the Story itself being the imperative driving force behind. Largely helped by acute detailings done in its Screenplay division.
Back and forth transitions discreetly seperating two distinctive timelines; that have been arranged with nothing but flat-out finesse.The only rationale for which I'm not giving this a perfect score here might seem like a petty critique. But to tell you the truth, I feel the characterization needed more gravitas.
Above all the dynamic in-between the Mother & her Daughter should have had a lot going for them. Taking into account that lone facet was quintessential to the narrative.Now, what about the ending you may ask?
In all honesty, I liked that slightly twisted alteration. Simply because it felt more fitted and conforming to my own interpretations. I love it when these tales shift onto a darker side.",The Call
20,Stanlee107,The wrong call,6,13 December 2020,This movie combined the notebook and good old South Korean horror. It is intriguing that they show the butterfly effects: make changing decisions in the past & the consequences for the present and future. What if the person that you save turns out to be one that causes nothing but pain for others?I read other reviews & I agree that the ending makes little sense. If your past self is killed then there is no way of re-writing history to change that.... Unless there is another time line in which another person involved alters it... Given the limited characters in the film there is nobody that would do that. I understand the film makers would like to make a sequel but come on at least give us a logical sense for this?!,The Call
21,ridi-arahan,Life is a product of series of events and the repercussions of those actions put together,8,12 January 2021,"What worked:
It's an interesting movie, keeping on the edge of your seat for most part of the movie. It's a thriller, I would say, with Butterfly effect into practice. The movie is exciting; well written , acted and directed. Although multiple realities and layers in a story is not very unpopular theme, but it is executed well, making us live the experience till the end.
What did not work:
Maybe many people, including me would argue that the post credit made the beautiful experience a bit unsatisfactory and worrisome. The movie has its moments and also some loopholes in the story. Overall, the experience is mostly pleasant except the post credit.
Final verdict: recommended. Like many said, skip the post credit for your own solace. If you want to explore, why not.",The Call
22,Xavier_Stone,"It's ok, and certainly not a materpiece",5,6 December 2020,"The first half is definitely interesting and keeps the viewers engaged. Then slowly dips into a b level horror film when a thinking thriller would have been much better suited. Several plot holes and average acting prevent this from becoming popular.And yes there are two endings, one before the credits and one after, which is added as a kinda gotcha punch but actually makes zero sense as others have accurately pointed out and just further exposes the poor story line.",The Call
23,user-651-726996,A Scary 'Frequency',5,7 August 2021,The film is similar to the 2000 Hollywood film 'Frequency' only here it's very evil. This was a really good thriller until the final sequence messed it up.,The Call
24,svader,Dumb,1,6 January 2021,If the past is changed then why is the future as it is and not actually the present of the changed past. Trust me that makes sense if you stop and think about it.Poor film with hype about nothing.Oooh ive left my phone on the train.Just forget about it and not call back from the house phone to see what number called.Fumb.Whole thing makes no sense and test is so simplistic it's irritating.I didn't make it to the end to experience the rubbish ending as many have pointed out.,The Call
25,baunacholi-86159,A thriller how it should be!,8,16 December 2020,"And yet, so rare...
Loosely inspired by frequency and butterfly effect the call manages brilliantly to deliver a very dark and unsettling story. Unexpected moves, sick decisions, intelligent story, amazing acting (one of the best villain I've seen - ever), emotional and very very twisted. I did not mind the ending at all, what's wrong leaving the door open for a sequel? The call is anyway not a feel good movie... no puppy bonus for anyone.",The Call
26,shanayneigh,Decent horror/drama,6,2 September 2021,"I came close to giving up within the first ten minutes, but it got better. It reminds me quite a bit of the Dennis Quaid movie ""Frequency"". The movie can't decide which ending it wants, so it tries to have both. Not surprisingly having your cake and eating it too isn't a recipe for success. It's a shame they decided to include the end credit scenes.",The Call
27,sriramthestranger,Fantastic Movie!!!,10,6 December 2020,"This movie is a mind-blowing take on time travel thrillers. It keeps you hooked to the screen with only five major characters throughout the runtime. There are multiple moments where you root for the protagonist - such was the villainy of the other character.

32,Mivas_Greece,"The thriller of the year! Original idea, well-developed script, emotion, suspense and many twists.",8,17 December 2020,"Fiction / Thriller movie from Korea. Another great example from Korean cinema. One of the best thrillers of the year. Combines fantasy with horror. A particularly unusual call from the past. A contact with the past, which has the power to change the present by changing the past. Can one girl help the other? What will happen in the end? What personality is hidden behind the girl of the past? How long will the friendship last before it turns into a nightmare for the girl of the present? An asymmetric threat awakens in the past and can define the events of the present at will. Can knowledge of present protect her from the threat of the past? A thriller with a fairly uncommon idea, very good performances, each in its own role, a fairly well-developed script, with enough emotion, suspense and multiple twists in the plot of the film. The end consists of multiple twists and the last big one is after the end titles. Although I personally would prefer not to have the last twist and close the movie with the already nice and emotional ending (if you want, skip the last twist after the end titles, to close the movie in a better way). The thriller of the year. Recommended to everyone.",The Call

37,mochteam,"Korean copy cat movie of ""The Caller"".",5,23 October 2021,"Truly I'd give this film a 4 but it was shot nicely so I gave it a 5.I saw ""The Caller"" years ago. As any horror fan you watch all types of movies even the ones that everyone else isn't watching. The Caller was one of those ""wow this is good but no one knows about it"" type of films. It was unique and I remember it for it's concept. Then I started watching ""The Call"" and wow did they just put a Korean Remix on that movie.This film has the same concept as the call but they also steal scenes straight out of ""The Caller"". The scene where the main character gets hot water poured on her as a child and you see her burn marks appearing in the present day. People she loves in the present day being killed in the past by the psycho, trying to get the psycho killed by sending them to a place that's going to have a catastrophe and the psycho still survives. They sure took a lot from that movie and spun it around.The difference here is that it's based around a family, and you can see the psycho woman in the past and talking to the girl in the present day. In ""The caller"" the horror of it is that the you never see the ""Psycho woman"" you only hear her talking on the phone which makes it more suspenseful. You can't tell if she's happy,angry, or annoyed or what she's going to do until things just start changing the film.In The Call thing start changing and you see them happening. It's not exactly a mystery like in The Caller when you don't know until the girl leaves the house. It's not so bad to remake or re-spin a movies concept at this movie has a lot of original ideas also but there isn't much of a payoff. The ending ruins the film entirely by twisting the plot to make the film edgy. I knew the film wasn't going to be good when I heard them playing the Korean knock off version of Korn but sheesh. They really derailed the movie.Having the killer in the present day call herself in the past after would have already been killed to stop the heroines mother from killing her and rescuing her daughter was a giant plot hole. Then the final scene that would confuse anyone that didn't pay attention is the main character waking up in the new future tied in the torture basement of the Killer when time changes again.That kind of ending does not work for a movie like this. The Phone Killer isn't Jason Vorhees, or Michael Meyers or even Freddy Kruger. The Phone killer isn't someone the audience is rooting for. We actually want to see her gone. I can only compare the ending to vomiting up after you just brushed your teeth. Here you are all refreshed after getting the happy ending after watching this discombobulated film and then it twist right back into crap.Certainly when you watch a movie like this and it has a bad ending it ends up in the annoying bin not the enjoyable watch it again bin.",The Call

40,mbhgkmsgg,The Call,7,8 December 2020,"The Call is a Korean sci-fi thriller/horror film. In this case, the emphasis should definitely be on 'thriller'. Although it starts off very creepy and eventually finds that same creepiness towards the end, the rest of the movie is quite a basic mystery thriller. The thriller elements work great and make this film surprisingly tense.I, like I'm sure many others, went in expecting this to be a horror film. And the film certainly made me think that it's going to be exactly that. The first 20 or so minutes are very creepy and capture the essence of the haunted house genre quite well. However, as soon as the main character figures out what's happening around her, the movie quickly transitions into a fast-paced cat & mouse thriller. I didn't mind this change, but it did catch me a little off guard. The horror elements in the beginning very so convincing that I was sure that the rest of the movie would follow in suit. But it didn't. And truth be told, I'm glad it didn't. I'm not a huge fan of the haunted house genre, and as such, the change of style probably ended up making me like this movie more.The Call tries to stand apart from the rest of the genre through its concept. And fortunately, it succeeds. We find ourselves thrown into the life of Seo-yeon, who receives a mysterious call from an old phone. What we, and her, quickly realize, is that these calls are coming from the same house, but 20 years earlier. Both women, the one living in the past and the one in the present, quickly realize that they are dependent on one another. Both pursue personal interests, and a game of cat and mouse promptly begins. This premise, and idea, add their own twist. Trying to outsmart the other person isn't quite as simple anymore, as they are living two decades apart. Accordingly, both come up with some rather creative ways to try and beat the other. While this concept is great for the most part, it, unfortunately, became quite predictable, which certainly lessened the intensity of the film.One of the best parts about The Call was how it represented loss and gain. There are certain time-line and life-altering moments that have a drastic impact on Seo-yeon's life. Rather than just rely on practical changes, the film goes to great lengths to depict them visually as well. One example might be how her hair changes depending on the state that her life is in. Or how the colours of the film adjust with her. While these types of visual displays wouldn't have been necessary, they added more weight to what was happening.
And while there are a lot of great things in this movie, the aforementioned visuals included, the ending nearly ruins the whole thing. Right before the credits start rolling, I thought that the movie had ended, and I quite liked that ending. However, right after the first credit, another scene happens. And more quickly follow. In total there are four or five scenes that take place in between the actor credits. While they add a certain sense of horror and dread, they were completely unnecessary, and took away what was a very satisfying and appropriate conclusion. So, if you do watch this movie, I would recommend that you stop watching as soon as you feel like you have arrived at the end and as soon as you see the first actor's name credited. The alternative ending simply isn't worth it, and in my opinion, made the movie worse.As a whole, though, there is a lot to like in The Call. It's a very well made film with an interesting and quite engaging concept. While it might not be as much of a horror film as it promises, I, for one, enjoyed the thriller style and thought that it worked very well. If it weren't for the ending and the sometimes too easily predicted story, this could've definitely been one of the better films of the year.",The Call
41,matrixdukenukem,"Yes, people are right. No ending doesn't justify 1 or 5 stars.",8,15 January 2021,"So this movie has a two ending thing going on for some reason. The second ending didn't really break the whole experience for me. People giving this otherwise fantastic movie rating between 1-5 is really immature. First half n hour is a slow build up which is a formula many korean thrillers take. But when it picks up, it's a ride, oh yes. Both our leads play their part fantastically. Like many time dilation movies this isn't so hard to understand.But this movie has its own issues, takes the route of convenience and there is no explanation whatsoever of how the phone call works.Other than that it's a fun thriller, will keep you on the edge. Violence and gore isn't gratuitous. But if you're someone who takes offence with sudden tone change or experiment, turn it off as soon as the end credit starts.",The Call
42,TreeFiddy53,What. A. Movie!! Loved it!!,9,7 December 2020,"The trailer for The Call looked really interesting in the first 10 seconds or so and it went up on my list of movies to watch, real fast. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the rest of the trailer. Little did I know that I was in for a surprise.Sharing information through time, changing the past/present/future, all that sounded familiar to me from movies like Back To The Future, expected very similar things to happen here. But this movie, no-no-no, this turned out to be VERY DIFFERENT. Slightly mind-bending, even.AMAZING acting, GREAT background music that keeps your attention, builds the intensity. Some really good visuals that make you go ""okay, I wasn't expecting that!"" Some really good suspense and thrill as well. Stick around for the credits!Park Shin Hye is a brilliant actress. She, needless to say, did an amazing job conveying all sorts of emotions - happy, sad, angry, scared, etc. But so did Jeon Jong-seo. Tough to say who was better in the movie. In movies like these, the villains seldom get the range of emotions to work with, and given that limitation, I'd say Jong-seo takes the cake, 51-49.I am also glad that the negative role in the movie was played by a female lead, not sure if it was a conscious decision. It would have been nothing new to have a male play that role, not sure if much would have changed in the movie either. But I'm glad that Jong-seo was picked to do this, it was refreshing to see a female killer for a change.Getting back to the movie, I have never wanted find answers as badly as I did after this movie in a long time. I watched the movie as soon as it released on Netflix so the wait for people online to watch it and share their thoughts was painstaking. 2 days of discussion later, I found some answers. Countless Youtube videos later, I still need some answers. Most videos online only discuss the obvious. And I think that adds to the effect that movie has on the audience. 10 years since Inception released, people still discuss the ending. Not that I am comparing The Call to Inception, but for those who watch Korean movies, and watch global thrillers, the ending of this movie will be talked about and discussed for a looong time.Totally worth your time!",The Call
43,tmpsvita,Complicated but not the way it wants to be,5,29 November 2020,"The Call is complicated but not in the way it wants to be.
With a story like this one, original and very difficult to properly develop, you can have a great movie or and entertaining one but you need a really capable writer in both the cases. Unfortunately Chung-Hyun Lee is a decent director that knows how to entertain the audience but it's not a writer that knows how to handle a story this particular, even if he was the one that came up with it.
This idea, because this is what we really see here: a great idea, needed more effort into the script to be transposed into something that made sense, instead the screenplay appears shallow, messy and ignorant, with logic too often sacrificed for entertainment purposes leading to plot holes and inconsistent plot twists that make you enjoy the movie less and less until it becomes more disappointing than engaging and more nonsensical than smart.",The Call

47,A_Llama_Drama,"Fun, nasty horror with time travelling twists",6,26 January 2021,"The Call pits the wits of two young women, literally in different generations, against one another and lets the carnage rumble.Seo-Yeon's life is turned upside down when she receives a call on a phone from a young girl who's being abused by her mother. They build a bond and eventually realise they're not in the same time as one another. Young-Sook can help Seo-Yeon fix her past, and Seo-Yeon can help Young-Sook forge a brighter future. Things may be looking up for the fatherless Seo-Yeon and captive Young-Sook! Except, trauma runs deep and the scars that form won't let Young-Sook escape her future. So begins a brutal, violent game of coercion as Young-Sook forces Seo-Yeon to be her fortune teller, happily making changes to Seo-Yeon's present reality by destroying the past anytime she fails to comply.Visually, the story is a treat as time and reality change with mind altering scenes. The climax of the violence wrought by Young-Sook exploding on screen as car, land and human disassemble in front of a disbelieving Seo-Yeon. Young-Sook, akin to some brutish Genie in a lamp, poses a menacing threat to anyone she comes in contact with once freed by Seo-Yeon. Be careful what you wish for, and be careful who you ask.
Sadly, the time and reality altering aspect of the movie isn't fully explored and at times appears to be a device just to spice up a stale genre. Still, the story ""The Call"" tells is exciting enough to make up for any discrepancies.Netflix's horror quality is usually weak sauce, but ""The Call"" has enough nastiness to satiate most horror buffs out there.",The Call

Just as you think you know what will happen, it all changesIt's not a horror but it gets increasingly creepyI wasn't a fan of the final twist at the end. With so many scare films having a twist at the end, it seems reasonable to assume the writers added the final twist as a way to keep it fresh, but it didn't work for me, and the film would have been better without it.Unpredictable, unsettling and a reasonable story, this film is for people who want a new type of scare film.Highly recommended.",The Call

Only if you want to see something new, mesmerizing, twisted, and largely unpredictable. The writers and makers did do an excellent job of giving you the idea something was skewed during the introduction/setup of the movie, but that was an expectation that was well worthed and making us beg for more.Officially, no, you should never listen when people say that you have to watch a movie, but I'm sure glad I watched this one. The few Korean flicks I've seen on Netflix put spins on storytelling that go beyond your wildest imagination.I do have to agree a little bit with the people reviewing saying that the post-credit scene ruins the movie. It's contradictory in that we first get to see the change, but then it isn't.In all other cases the changes came forth from interaction between timelines. With the last change there was no option for any kind of interaction and then there suddenly was, so it felt contrived, like maybe a producer begging for a sequel? So Hollywood, ugh. I don't know who came up with it, but what was shouldn't be, and in this case I mean the writing of the post-credit scene.Other than that, everything before the credits rolled surpassed perfection, which in itself is also pretty twisted.

Music too. However, I'm very bothered by the grimdark ending after the initial ending. The movie is already depressing and grimdark as it is with the villainess killing almost everyone (the father dying got me...), then when you finally get some relief at the end when the heroine and her mother survive, they throw in that nonsense post credit scene with the villainess somehow surviving after all (what was up with that, it made no sense?), and killing the mother of the heroine, and keeping the heroine captive...Seriously not cool...Oh well...Really good, but the ending kind of ruined it for me...P.S: I notice some people didn't understand certain things in the movie. It does have a lot of details, after all. I recommend rewatching the movie a second time if there's something you don't get, as that might help, since pretty much everything is actually explained in the movie, you just need to be vigilant while watching.

Add in some good acting, nice cinematography and very decent direction, and you end up with a little gem.However, you should avoid trying to tack on an ending intended to make everything even more dramatic and melancholic if it completely counters and nullifies the story's internal logic, and alas, this is exactly what happened here.But as long as our conditioned reflex to disregard certain aspects of a story kicks in (as it already has in franchises like STAR WARS, STAR TREK and TERMINATOR, sadly), you might enjoy this well-paced and suspenseful flick.

The time travel plot movies with butterfly effect have been used for hundred times, but it is an amalgam of many elements including motherhood, trust, betray, detective logics which you cannot really predict in the end. The director makes a good effort to develop both girls' unfortunate life and the plot becomes something of its own and full of twists, that making us 100% believe in YoungSook's innocence. However, things develop out of control and heart-breathing in the middle part. All is so gripping and compelling and filled with tension.The performances, too, both actresses are extremely great. Park Shin Hye does an excellent job about perfectly demonstrating how a desperate and regrettable person looks alike. JeonJong Seo as a new actress whose performance is amazing that really make my skin crawl her insane character.The ending comes with lots of critics as people think it's non-sensible that the future Young Soon can mange to escape the fate of death via saving the past Young Sook. I am agree it is quite complicated to digest all details within the last few minutes.

But there is beauty even though it is a sombre colour palette. Besides that, the transitions are fitting as well. From locating the missing smartphone of our lead character, a Galaxy Note 9 (not sponsored) to be exact, the scene slowly and beautifully transitioned to a brain scan.Okay, that might be ridiculous to some. But I do love a good transition. And with The Call (2020), it does not end with simple film transitions. There are several as the story shows us various process or periods of changing from one state to another, which are often heartbreaking. The narrative keeps moving and transforming as both our leads do what they need to survive and live the life they deserve.And we all know this does not always work out. Sure, we can repeatedly change our life or rather what is up ahead as we have the power to plan or retract every decision we make. However, we cannot control external factors nor mould our life according to what we only want. And most importantly, we can not change the past. A truth that is hard for everyone to accept.Speaking of which this film is not about time travel. No one travels from past to present or vice versa. The Call (2020) focuses more on connecting with the past and then bending reality when one realises she had the upper hand.This horror mystery thriller is one of those films that work your brain.

If you're expecting an explanation for the ability of the calls to cross time, there isn't one. And that's fine. The movie hooks you quickly, and doesn't let go. You just accept the situation and indulge your fascination.
The actress who plays Young-Soo is INCREDIBLE. She performs every mood to perfection and with impact, and the movie is better for it.
There are several twists during the movie, all of which are well done and executed (not including post-credit). Many reviewers have talked about the credits and advised skipping them - which obviously ensured I was extremely curious. It's not the fact that the post-credits are more of a ""downer."" One aspect shown simply breaks one of the cardinal rules of time travel. It's fine to watch those scenes, but considering the rules it breaks, I cannot accept it as a ""real"" ending but rather some alternative to have a ""bad ending"" that feels like it was by an entirely new writer. In my opinion, the movie is not overly worse off for those scenes if you can brush them aside. It just feels like a disrespectful mistake on what is otherwise an engrossing chilling thriller. I would definitely label this as thriller and not horror. No jumpscares, thankfully.
I definitely will be recommending this film to others.",The Call

123,joshuarenealvarez,Call (2020),7,29 November 2020,"Call is a South Korean thriller which revolves around Yeon Seo (portrayed by Park Shin-hye)
who stumbles upon a doorway into the past through receiving a telephone call from Young Sook (portrayed by Jeong Jong-seo) whom is the sole reason why I believe audiences should view this film due to providing an astounding performance as a troubled individual. Forced to endure verbal and physical abuse from her mother. The two characters are separated twenty years apart from each other. Living in
different timelines, they eventually form a relationship based on their similarities and Young Sook reluctantly agrees to help weave a brighter future for her companion. Unfortunately, genuine intentions lead to sinister consequences as the decision to alter events will affect past and present forever.The plot is reminiscent to films such as
The Butterfly Effect (2005) and Looper (2012).The main theme deals with the concept
of free will and how the choices of the leading characters can affect the lives of those
around them. Although, Call (2020) is slightly less engaging than those films. Initially intrigued with the premise. I personally do not believe this film was executed well. It begins as
a slow burn that becomes tedious to a degree
and it gradually evolves into a film that is
by-the-numbers. I found this to be predictable, the run-time was longer than it should
have been and I stopped caring during the second act due to the lack of emotional attachment I had for the characters. I was exhausted by the time the end credits
started rolling. This film even leaves
an unsatisfactory open-ending for a
sequel that I have no desire toward viewing.I would recommend this film if you have an available schedule this weekend. The cinematography from Jo Young-jik is absolutely gorgeous and the narrative is easy to follow and cohesive but I would certainly not go into this film expecting originality.Follow me on instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

128,gilcatt,The ending scene explained from a corean perspective,10,14 March 2021,"Intriguing, how so many reviewers hated the scene included in the credits, to the point where they advise you not to watch it.I was curious, I got it.Is it because it left them in a state of denial, robbed of their hopes for a happy ending in the very last seconds ? Most probably.
A CLEVER TRICK FROM THE DIRECTORThe last scene is the ugly true ending. Not the fictitious alternate one we hoped for out of empathy for the ""good"" girl, shown first. The ""evil"" girl wins, and as humans we are conditioned not to like that. Especially in the West.But so be it. In corean culture (see below for details) only shamans have the power to defeat a demon. The ""good"" girl plays with fire despite being warned by the shaman, and looses.Such a great unhappy ending, a rarity in movies, suits the script perfectly. Dark, murderous and hopeless. I believe it actually makes all the difference and saves the movie, which would otherwise end on a cheesy, happy note in typical Hollywood fashion.Of course the whole movie falls apart when you start looking for logical inconsistencies. Who cares ? There are always plenty in a script based on some time quirks.
AS FAR AS THE LAST SCENE IS CONCERNED, EVERYTHING FITSIt starts from the point when the ""good"" girl is trapped by the ""evil"" girl in the present. All she has to do is to check the police report the ""good"" girl robbed at the police station. And act accordingly to change the past, and therefore the present, warning herself. Logical : had she been dead, she would not have been able to meet the ""good"" girl in the present.
DEMONS AND SHAMANISM IN COREAN CULTUREWe have to take the corean culture into account. Shamanism has been at the heart of corean culture since prehistoric times. It is not a minor detail in the movie.When the movie starts we soon learn that the mother-in-law of the ""evil"" girl is a shaman (Mudang) who knows her daughter-in-law is possessed by a demon that has to be killed to prevent deaths. She tries everything to save her, but it does not work, so she reluctantly decides to kill her. It fails and we know why.In the end we can assume she was right.In the traditional corean culture, shamans are supposed to terminate a demon when they spot one. It is their duty.Around 1890, protestant missionnaries started a ruthless repression that lasted for a century. In the 70s and 80s the repression reached new heights, in South-Corea, notably during the autoritarian rule of Park Chung-hee, a devout Boudhist, with full backing from the protestant churches and fundamental evangelists. Thousands of shamans were jailed, tortured and killed.Regardless, shamanism has remained present in popular culture and its practice is rising again. Nowadays, around 20% of the South Corean population regularly contract shamans for advice and cleansing, up from 5% in the seventies. Shamanism is now recognized as the natural corean religion.Who else but a demon would be able to make a phone call in the future to save itself ?There is another clear reference to shamanism and demons in the movie, through the ""evil"" girl's favorite pop star, Seo Taiji. He has been accused of being a shaman who had sealed a deal with the devil, a rumour which turned into a nationwide scandal in the '90s. In Corea such an accusation was then considered a very serious matter by a large majority.Yes the movie is 100% coherent, as far as corean culture is concerned. Only a shaman is able to terminate a demon. An innocent girl has no such power.In this movie, evil wins. Because we lost our shamans.
It is a warning but there is hope, eventually, as they are on the rise again.
(Not me saying this, but that's the spirit...)

This is a taught and marvelously inventive little horror film. In what seems to me to be an lift from from the Dennis Quaid/ Jim Cavievel film of 2000, ""Frequency"", we have a young woman who finds an old wireless landline phone in her parents old house. She receives a call one night from a young girl who is about to be murdered by her mother. The hitch here is that the young girl calling had died 10 years earlier.That's all your going to get from me as far as plot. But let me say that this film was a good surprise! It kept breaking my second guesses and what I thought was going to transpire at every turn.Writer/ Director Chung-Hyun Lee has built a marvelous thriller and has gotten two absolutely rock solid performances by actresses Jong-seo Jun and Park Shin-Hye. The film is a must see for all horror fans, but anyone who enjoys a good thriller will be riveted.As with most (if not all) time travel plot lines, there are parallels that shouldn't be possible, but the script is so well written that these conundrums are almost always addressed, and creatively so.It is a roller coaster ride, and as tight as a new catcher's mitt.

I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't watch past the credits. I thought the initial ending was beautiful and resolved the mother/daughter arc perfectly. I was just relived that darkness didn't win this particular battle...
If you don't watch past the credits I promise you're in for a great ride.

Especially the main roles do their job well.

The storyline was gripping and engaging which made me watch the movie without boredom.

First, when the protagonist is kidnapped, she would remember the facts. The movie sees the young and older protaginist as two different people for some reason, which doesn't make any sense in the timeline.Imagine that you can change your past, you would remember what happened to you as ""it happens"".The end in the cemetery is quite nice, because shows you that you have to love the people that are around you, and not take anything for granted, because you can lose them (even the strawberry guy).But the ""after ending"" destroys the timeline just to make an cliffhanger for a 2, 3 and continuation. The idea is what ruins a lot of series, directors/writters wanting to milking a stone, and destroying what would be a great story just for make continuations.In the second-ending, the movie shows that the future can call the past (breaking its own rules), a dead person be revived from a future-non-existent person (?), a phone call that could be done before facts happening, the future self remembering the past (but with the protagonist this not happens).It's really sad that a good story is ruined by the idea of making more money of something that is good and should end where it ended.

I liked the relationship of the two main characters, and I thought the acting was good.Where this movie started to lose me was after Oh young-sook killed her dad !gain. I felt like she lost her leverage, as if she killed her in the past she'd simple just not exist. I felt like that wasn't really a of a motivator I found myself checking the time for the last 20 minutes of the movie. If it was a little bit shorter I think it could've helped the pacing.The last 60 seconds of post-credit scenes instantly dropped a point off my rating. How could the future Young-sook call her past self if she was going to die? She'd have no way of knowing that would happen. If she did know, why would she let Seo-yeon near the phone to warn her mother?? I know a lot of horror doesn't have a happy ending, but this felt as comical as ""Scary Movie's"" joke twist.

I do not expect happy and closed endings for my thriller horrors but there it was for a few minutes. And I thought South Korea did something different. Nope. F the credits scene honestly.I see talk of, ""oh, but it introduces potential sequels"" in the other reviews. This film does not need a sequel. As I said before, it is a perfect film and it works entirely on its own. (The sequels would be total garbage anyway. Like Happy Death Day 2 or something.)

197,glikeyee,Compelling + refreshing spin on a neo-classical trope; an interlinked past and present is the only thing that 2017's 'The Call' mirrors from 2000's 'Frequency',8,28 June 2021,"Reviewers can't help but parallel the South Korean crime thriller 'The Call' with the modern American classic, 'Frequency.' It's an understandable comparison: two individuals, linked through some sort of space-time continuum glitch afflicting the Universe's pagefile and/or TCPIP bandwidth (where my IT nerdz at? Holla at ya boy).This cosmic time-dilation anomaly is an alarming but seemingly fateful twist of chance two women find themselves soon indulging in their day-to-day lives as their personal stressors rapidly pile up at their feet and emotional claustrophobia sets in. Amid the tumultuous navigation of their own personal circumstances, each woman -- separated by twenty earth years of time from one another (whether this time dilation involves separate timelines, ie. Multiverse, running concurrently or a single timeline with a wormhole-like phenomena connecting past and present is never really explained IIRC) -- find solace in their nightly conversations over the phone with each other, after several bouts of familial drama lead each woman to discover what can only be described as a sort of, communication wormhole connecting past and present within their respective telephones. Mind you, the telephones we're talking about are traditional landlines with spiral cords and non-HD voice calling before the time of CallerID and VoIP and mobile LTE. There's no cellular shennaigans or mobile mayhem afoot in The Call, just good ol' fashioned all nighters like the ones you pulled in elementary school in the 90s and early 2ks before Singular and companies like Verizon/Sprint dominated the industry and changed civilization's phone habits and needs forever.What really separates The Call from Frequency is its layered narrative revolving around a vicious Serial Killer and their obfuscated connection to both women despite a 20 year gap in time between them. That's the heart the mystery in The Call, and it's a theme that is explored to a rather satisfactory culmination--something that a viewing audience doesn't get to say that often whenevver it comes to movies and shows dealing with plots where timelines colide and characters navigate their pasts, presents or futures. It never tries to be more than it is, which is at the crux of it all, an intriguing murder mystery that is just as compelling as it is stylish.The Call has that trademark SK nihilism peppering the story and its conclusion(s), but it's also at moments surprisingly wholesome and even heartwarming at times much like its spiritual predecessor, 2000's Frequency. There's also an interesting character study aspect to the plot of The Call involving the female psyche and violence, specifically that of murder and/or sadism and how such abherrant behaviors affect women of this particular milieu. It's actually somewhat reminiscent of the gut-punching megabomb 'Bedeviled' and its dark and bleak deciphering of domestic violence against women in rural communities who don't have the same kind of resources or support networks available to them that women living in metropolitan areas and urban population centers do.It's one of the better South Korean movies currently on Netfli;x, and it pairs well with 'Forgotten' and 'The Wailing' for those viewers looking to indulge themselves in a weekend movie mashathon.Enjoy :-)",The Call

There is some question about how the sequence of events in the past ties in with the present state of the protagonist (the logic of it). But overall, it's equally suspenseful and creepy.",The Call
200,VajraRaja,Call 2020 Explained,8,14 January 2021,"The movie subverts the viewer's expectations by depicting a troubled protagonist trying to mask their own guilt. To understand the film, it is important to distinguish the protagonist's perspective and point of view with their actual predicament. Although the film may leave more to be desired, it does a great job misleading the viewers while subtlety revealing it's cards.The film centers around the point of view of the protagonist, who in actuality is severely delusional and has borderline personality disorder (although this is projected by the protagonist onto her imaginary caller, I will get to this shortly). The protagonist has an underlying repressed childhood trauma caused by accidentally killing her father in a house fire. As a coping mechanism she convinces herself to believe in alternate realities, those in which she is innocent victim. This is most evident when she blames her own mother for her father's death. She believes that her mother was responsible for the fire, thus resenting her even late into adulthood. The mother burdens this pain, despite being on her deathbed caused by brain cancer, as she doesn't want to cause her child's mental health to further deteriorate. However as we later to come realize, her mother is truly innocent while the protagonist was actually responsible for her killing her father. And deep down in her repressed shadow, she understands this.As the protagonist returns to her childhood home, she notices a hidden basement, a chair in the center with her old toys, along with a box left behind by the past tenants. This is when her mental state really becomes FUBAR. She imagines the stairs leading to the basement to be smoldering in flames, symbolizing that she cannot let go of burning her house and father to ashes.Recall that when she first arrives to the home she loses her phone. She uses the find my phone app, and it reveals to be in the same location and is switched to the MRI brain scan. This may appear to be leading to next events, but it just retreads past events. The transition from phone to brain scan is illusory. She has her own phone and is just calling herself, it is revealed that she requires the phone but did she never really lost it is all just in her head. Therefore, she is just calling herself repeatedly, this sets the narrative of the entire story. She is ultimately calling her own phone, and is just talking to herself. However, in her mind she believes that she is truly conversing with someone else in the past.What does the person on the phone claim? SHE LIVES WITH HER MOTHER WITHOUT A FATHER (step-mother because she wants no blood relationship with her aside from her father), SHE HAS PERSONALITY DISORDERS, SHE CLAIMED THAT HER MOTHER TRIED TO KILL HER BY BURNING HER, SHE DESPISES HER MOTHER HOPING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE DIED. Sound familiar? It definitely should! The protagonist just substituted her mental image of her past self, onto her image of the past tenant of the house. They really only met once when the protagonist was a child. Yet being scared of her as a kid, ingrained the girl as a villain in the shadow of the impressionable kid. The villain is simply the shadow of the protagonist. Additionally, they share many similarities, since that is what the protagonist conceived of herself. Both can't drive cars, both use fire extinguishers as weapons (she explains to her mother how to use a fire extinguisher as a weapon which is the same method the girl in the past killed others), they have the same exact stencil outlining their hands leading to a perfect overlap. Further signifying that she is just interacting with herself.Instead of coming to terms with her own past, she tires to undue her fathers accident by altering history. Yet no matter what occured the resulting outcome is set. She remains response for her fathers death, while her mother is responsible protecting her family. This is the only consistent in all the narratives she perceived. She realizes that she was infact the one that burned down the house yet repressed. The girl in the past is just her shadow, a projection of unwanted thoughts. She blames the other girl for killing her father, when in actuality it was her. While the mother was the one that saved her, and burdened herself with the pain. This is symbolized by the mother protecting the protagonist in the past and present by grabbing the blade hands on and talking out the villain. Thus saving her child from guilt and harm.
Any supposed changes in the past were only temporary fixes and not consistent with reality. Aside from trivial things such as leaving behind time capsules, which may as well have been placed by the younger protagonist. Any big change is only superficial yet quickly deteriorated. The father may have ""survived"" for a while but ultimately died because of the protagonists decisions. The mother had terminal brain cancer, changing the past wouldn't have prevented this. Surprisingly she never made a change regarding her mother, such as getting an early screening etc. yet she still miraculously fantasized that her mother was no longer terminally ill. This reveals that the altered events never actually occured, and had no merit at all. It was all a figment of her wild imagination. She simply wanted a reality where her father was happy and she no longer had to scapegoat her terminally ill mother. But more importantly, she could begin to forgive herself.
So what really happened in the end? The father died in the fire, maybe in that vary house considering its charred and dilapidated state. This resulted, in underlying trauma and personality disorder within the protagonist. The protagonist blamed the mother for their predicament thus resenting her all this time. As she returned to the house she is literally haunted by the past. By the time she realizes the truth, her mother passed on from brain cancer and was buried along with the father. She tried to have closure by spending time with her father and properly saying goodbye to her mother.

208,ellagordon-54475,Entertaining film!! Keep's you watching!!! Only problem is the two alternate endings they've put in ><,9,11 December 2020,"Great film!! If you understand film's where time crosses over (basically time travel film's) then you will understand and enjoy this film. Ignore the people that say it makes no sense because it does!! It comes quite fast pace in the last half only because so much is happening but if you keep up with everything it's very entertaining, definitely keeps you watching. I hoped this film would be good because some Netflix films can be really cheesy and bad but this is one of the good ones. The trailer doesn't tell you much apart from the main point of the phone I guess, so I didn't know what to expect with this film which is why I enjoyed is so much. The most important thing with film's like this one is that you should watch it without any expectations, you'll enjoy it more if you don't know what's exactly coming. I love twists and I didn't see anything coming with this film so I definitely enjoyed it. Very clever storyline and concept. The effect's used at some points are very extra but make the film more fantasy like. This film definitely made me think things through over and over. Good acting too, Jeon Jong-seo is a brilliant actress!!!The only thing I will say is that they could have kept to one ending. You think it's ended but after some credits it's actually not. It's like they had two endings and didn't know which one to choose so they put both in which I think is what's confusing people. The ending they put in during the credits doesn't exactly fit in the storyline but if you just ignore the alternate ending they've put in for some reason the film makes sense.Would definitely watch again!! Very good film :)",The Call

212,foxdanger,A good production with some silly mistakes.,5,28 December 2020,"First of all: don't read the reviews talking about the credits scene. They didn't pay attention to all the movie scenes. At 1:28:43 you have a scene of future Young Sook calling herself in the past to advise herself about what is going happen. The scene at credits is just a continuation of this scene. So this is what happened: she called herself and advised herself. Seon mom's pushed her from the Stairs but she didn't died. That's it. The call in the credits wasn't AFTER the fall of the stairs. Was before the police and mom arrived at the house. As I said, the scene starts at 1:28:43 and is just cuted fast, and the rest of the scene is what it is in the credits.So, no problems at With that end... But the fact of young Sook called from future herself in the past, that is strange because the movie makes u believe that is impossible all the time, the past calls future every time, othewise Seon would not need wait calls, she could call... And we have lots of scenes with Seon waiting for the call. So, calling from future to the past doesn't seems possible... Until future Young Sook do it...Ano part that I didn't liked is that scene with young Sook at the barn which explode. The girl goes to a place which is distant and explodes in her face... 5.minutes later she is in home calling the future... Doesn't make any sense. This could be avoid with she calling a week later... Seon is living her life thinking that all was resolved and a week later she receives another call showing that Sook didn't died... But call 5 minutes later, dozens make ANY sense.Seon asks ""what u did to my father""... She should know because this is the new ""reality"" where she watched her dead being assassinated by Sook. So why she asks what Sook did? She should know....The same with the torture, she should remember that she was for long time being tortured by Sook. But only.when Sook burns her with the hot water (which should NOT make herself in pain in the future) she ""discovered"" that she is being tortured... No sense at all too. There's a lot of easy ways to fix this.This movie is good. The action is good. The production is amazing. Koreans are great doing movies.

Such is this movie: a really good mix of thriller with some fantasy time plot that links the two main characters from past and present timelines. The two actress are great in their roles. It is a non stopping thrill from the beginning to the very end, in good korean movies style. There are some really disturbing developments along the movie, a lot of gruesome scenes, and at some point it gets worse every time there is a new phone call from the past. But the present character made a very dumb decision that basically ruins everything when she decided to tell the past character that she would be arrested for life for her crimes. Why would she do that? It was a leverage that she had and she just gives that away. It made no sense. Well, overlooking this dumb decision, this is a very entertaining movie and the good surpasses the bad stuff.

The film tries to throw twists and turns at you leading up to a shocking climax, but it falls flat. Very flat. The credit scene makes the film even worse.

The antagonist actually NEVER died in any timeline, regardless of any phone call. She survived the fall just like the mom did. Something happens to her - we don't know what, as it's never shown - but it's implied she stays away from the protagonist and her family after that night for some reason (prison, run away, etc., we don't know), but it's obviously still thirsty for revenge. So the antagonist grows old in the new rewritten timeline that the protagonist created, in which the protagonist's past self doesn't do all the stuff we see her do throughout the movie (even though the protagonist's present self retains all those memories but not the new rewritten ones). This gives the villain the upper hand, as she has plenty of time to find the phone and find which days of the past will match which present days. So she waits until the day when the phone will be connected to that eventful night and makes the call. At this point there is no protagonist in her way because the protagonist is living her rewritten life without any knowledge of what's going on until she catches up with her present self timeline. Anyways... Great movie. Upsetting ending but still amazing thriller. Hopefully they make Call 2 and 3 and we can finally kill this b****.",The Call

275,katierisebug,Don't waste your time.,1,30 November 2020,"This movie made no sense. Yes, I understood exactly what was going on but as it pertains to the story line, it didn't add up. If her past was constantly being changed, her future self should already have experienced everything from her passed meaning she would already have those memories. I also don't like how she's the only one who gets to experience the many alternative futures but no one else. You'd think everyone who's experienced them would experience it but they don't. And her having to figure out how the future changed I think was dumb. Like I get it but that's not how time works, she's already know what was happening.If you knew someone was a serial killer and you knew they were gonna get a life sentence, post already killing two people, would you tell them? No. That not only risks your future life, which was exactly what happened, but you're letting a killer get away with murders.I kept seeing very high reviews but I didn't like this movie at all. The story line was cool but poorly executed. I don't think this movie even could be properly executed because then it wouldn't have that suspenseful thriller you're going for.

278,stoickthevast,Good but flawed...,6,2 December 2020,"Good concept wherein a conversation from a person from the past changes your future. It was nice and all, except for some parts.The plot went crazy when Seo-yeon confronted Young-sook with the death of her neighbor / friend. The way she reacted was a bit illogical in my opinion. He went to the police to confirm the death, then she spoke to someone to describe what Young-sook is like. From here on, she should have realized what kind of person Young-sook is. And from here, she could have gathered herself and know what the consequence would be if they end up not being in good terms.There are some other flawed scenes like the strawberry guy where his instinct told him to use the phone to brag that he's going to get killed instead of running or fighting for his life, the fighting scene where Seo-yeon wanted the possession of the phone instead of fighting for her life, also how the mom acted after seeing her leashed daughter and lastly, the horrible ending that everyone is talking about.Nonetheless it is still watchable despite being more and more disappointing towards the end.",The Call

If the serial killer came back to life and killed the protagonist's mom in the past then the serial killer will proceed to chop the protagonist with the machete anyway instead of vanishing in the air first. The ending doesn't flow with the entire story. Seeming like it is forced upon the whole picture.,The Call
280,sofiapenuliar,Wasted my tears for that last ending???,5,4 December 2020,"The movie was clearly very written, every scene was not boring which is honestly very rare for movies nowadays. I'm sure the writers knew how to keep people on the edge of their seats; even those with the shortest span of attention. Almost every plot twist made sense and were well-thought of. However, note that I said 'almost'. The 'real' ending of this movie is simply not counted for me. The plot twist is not even understandable. The writers should have left the initial ending as it is, since it was very emotional and I definitely shed some tears, but the ending just left almost everyone with a giant question mark. Very unsatisfying.",The Call

283,dyu_gs,Frustrated,3,8 December 2020,"BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD It has such a very good concept, the style and the flow is very nice and the actors and actresses were extremely good BUT and a big one, they blew it by making the main character act dumb and weird. I wanted to shout at her when she litterally didnt care about how she could save her from all that torture and how she didnt read her diary till the end. She litterally acted like everything was normal and ignored her calls when she had already read that her mother was trying to set her on fire. A normal person would definitly not act like she did and it felt like an obvious dumbness added to make the movie go smoother.Btw that ending makes no sense at all, throughout the whole movie they had paralel timelines and time flowed the same for them both and then you take the time back on the other girls timeline? Wtf if she was going to be able to talk to herself from the past it had to be her from after the fall not before the cop came CONCLUSION NO SPOILS If you dont mind those few scenes of dumbness that blew the whole movie its a 9/10, would definitly recommend for a person that doesnt watch films too frequently. If you do mind, dont even watch it you will want to punch the walls for all that lost potential.",The Call

It seems that the call that took place between the future and past versions of the killer was something that happened before the cop and mother got there. It wasn't a redo, it was a scene not shown to us prior. Another thing is that they say that this is a plot hole. Whether or not it is, she may have been able to disappear and not kill the protagonist by actually dying and somehow being able to resuscitate, which is what seems to have happened by her opening her eyes and stirring awake in one of the final scenes. Whether this takes away from the ending is up to you, i just want people to know the continuity of this before ripping the movie apart.",The Call

301,qxin1130,Ending Timeline Conundrum?,5,5 December 2020,"I'm not sure how to fully comprehend the ending timeline here. There are more questions than answers of course to the entirety of the call to begin with. But I guess the main two are:1. How does the phone call connect from 1999 to present day? The viewers are suppose to take it as is I guess, no actual scientific nor paranormal explanation here, just happens as is.2. So the timeline of the two characters continue to progress as is, there's no indication of the present Young-sook alerting herself in the past until the very end and that in itself is a whole conundrum because we see the mom throwing Young-sook over the balcony and then surviving so that Seo-yeon is able to find her mom alive at the cemetery, but then as they both leave the cemetery her mom flickers and disappears because Young-sook survives the fall also. Now if the mom survives with Seo-yeon, wouldn't they call the police or at least find out at some point that Young-sook didn't die so that she would remain a threat? We only have the past calling the present until the very end, where the one instance is Young-sook is calling herself in the past which is a reversal of this mysterious phone communication. How does this happen? Lets say she figured it out and can call herself in the past, how does she find the exact moment to call herself before the mom and the police arrives at the house? Because if both timeline are continually progressing in the past and the present, won't that moment in the past also have passed? And my conundrum here is how this ending is a miss because it doesn't validate the space time continuum sequence of events here. Either leave the ending as is with the mom being alive and Young-sook dead or mom dead because Young-sook never died.Things need to add up even if we're left with a cliff hanger but unfortunately this cliff hanger ended up making no sense.",The Call

It was really good at making the viewer feel anxious, and it did a really good job with its triller. Also, the acting was amazing.The ending, however, ruined it. Aside from leaving a bad taste in the mouth, it didn't make sense. The future called the past? That's going against the rules the movie set up from the beginning...Furthermore, the cemetery scene left a huge impression, and it gave the movie a meaning: Sometimes you take for granted the people around you and how much they love you. It was perfect. It would've been a great movie if it had stopped there.

307,philipp-gamer,The ENDING wants to be confusing - BUT...,7,13 December 2020,"Some reviewers said, that ""suddenly"" the present calls the past and that this would be against the time travel rule of the writers. BUT - the writers didn't violate against their own time travel rule.The past-Young Sook was the one who called the present-Young Sook. She actually wanted to call the present-Seo Yeon to ask her if she had found the evidences. Instead, present-Young Sook was on the phone and answered that a police officer and the mom are going to kill her (she warned her past-self). So the writers didn't break their own rule.BUT - the ending still doesn't makes sense.
Like many described before: if past-Young Sook had died in the fight, the present-Young Sook couldn't warn her past-self. If she had survived, she couldn't have disappeared in the present where Seo-Yeon found herself suddenly alone in the empty house, present-Young Sook vanished and everything turned out well into a happy end. She (present) would have caught Seo Yeon, took her down into the cellar and tied her up (as we see it in the alternative ending). In the alternative ending, we also see that the mother has already left (and probably took the child-Seo Yeon with her) as Young Sook woke up - which should show the viewers that she also survived the fall and legitimate a present-Young Sook who got (accidentally) the call by the past-Young Sook. This isn't logical because the mother would have called the police or even special forces to get that b**ch arrested.One option for me was, that the ending we saw, at the moment where Seo Yeons mom came out of the room to push Young Sook and herself over railing, she survived, Young Sook vanished and everything turned out well - never happened. That the ending we see in the credits is what only could have happened, because the mother actually died in that room, where we got to see the blood on the walls and the shattered window. After only Young Sook leaves the room it's clear that the mother must be the one who's dead. Instead the fictional happy end starts and we got the plot twist in the credits.
The surviving of Young Sook still doesn't makes sense and that's the point where my only conclusion is:The writers wanted it to be confusing like that. They want the viewers to ask themselves what the heck just happened in the end and how all of this could be explained. To recap all the little details. This is what you will talk about. With your family, friends and so on. This will hook others up to also watch the movie - and that's good!I really enjoyed the acting, the score and all the little details.
