0,Leofwine_draca,Cool kid's film,6,28 May 2015,"I remember catching this on TV as a kid and really liking it. Not much has changed in the years since, as this is still a cool, fun kid's adventure film, perhaps not as in depth or as well made as Joe Dante's EXPLORERS but nevertheless a firm staple of a 1980s childhood.The storyline is split into two halves, and the first half actually turns out to be an intriguing mystery about a boy who suffers a fall in the woods and who wakes up to discover eight years have mysteriously disappeared. Joey Cramer makes for a likable lead; maybe he's not the best actor in the world but I found myself caring about and identifying with his character.After this set-up, the second half lets rip with an exhilarating fantasy set piece in which the lad takes a journey around the world in a really cool-looking UFO. There are some excellent special effects here and plenty of humour thanks to the reliably strange Paul Reubens in a voice performance. It's all very lightweight but no less entertaining because of it. Sarah Jessica Parker turns up in an early supporting role and Veronica Cartwright (ALIEN) is as good value as ever playing the kid's stressed-out mother.",Flight of the Navigator
1,SnoopyStyle,one unbelievable turn in otherwise good children sci-fi fantasy,6,29 March 2015,It's 1978 Florida. 12 year old David Freeman (Joey Cramer)'s parents are Helen (Veronica Cartwright) and Bill (Cliff De Young). He falls down a ravine in the woods behind his house and hits his head. He wakes up to find 8 years have passed but he hasn't aged a single day. His little brother Jeff (Matt Adler) is now 16. Meanwhile Dr. Louis Faraday (Howard Hesseman) is investigating a crashed UFO. David seems to have a connection to the ship. Faraday convinces the family to allow David to go with him by his lonesome. Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a low level worker at the secret facility who befriends David.There is a moment where this movie goes off the tracks a little. Faraday is able to convince David and his family to allow him to go off to a secret base with strangers all by himself. It's crazy unbelievable. No parents would ever do that without guns pointed at their heads especially for a 12 year old who's been missing for 8 years and presumed dead. I get the appeal of having the kid by himself in a strange environment. It raises the tension but does it in an unreasonable way. The core of the movie is a fascinating children's sci-fi fantasy. Joey Cramer is an endearing child actor. There are a lot to like in this movie but that turn keeps bugging me.,Flight of the Navigator
2,claudio_carvalho,A Delightful Sci-Fi From the 1980s,7,6 January 2004,"In 1978, in Fort Lauderdale, the twelve years old David Freeman (Joey Cramer) goes through the grove to bring his younger brother back home. He slides, falls in a hole and faints. When he wakes up and goes home, eight years have passed and he has not aged. Meanwhile, NASA scientists find a spacecraft near to a fallen electric tower. David is brought to NASA to be studied and soon he realizes that he can communicate with the UFO. He finds out that he was sent to a distant planet in a very high speed and became the navigator of the spacecraft. In his life, he had lost 4.4 hours. On Earth, eight years have passed. This movie is a delightful entertainment, using good special effects and having a very reasonable story. It is a family entertainment, indicated for all ages. Sarah Jessica Parker, famous presently due to the show `From Sex and the City', has a minor participation as a trainee in NASA. My vote is seven.",Flight of the Navigator
3,lee_eisenberg,I vaguely remembered a few scenes from this before watching it again,7,11 January 2014,"When I was in kindergarten, I used to go to a place after school. This place would occasionally show us tykes movies. They showed us ""E.T."", ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" a few times. But they also showed us another movie. When someone said the title, it sounded to me like ""How to Fight an Alligator"". That made no sense to little old me, since I couldn't imagine why anyone would attempt to fight an alligator (I later found out that people DO in fact fight alligators, but I'm not going to try that).Anyway, the scenes that registered in my mind were: the boy looks for his brother and gets scared when someone jumps out of the tree; the boy returns home and finds a different family there; the boy hides in the machine to board the alien ship; the boy says ""I promise"" and the voice says ""Don't know promise""; the boy calls the voice a geek; the voice says ""You called me a geek!""; the boy wakes up again in the forest. Overall, I found it as entertaining as a six-year-old would find it.I later learned that the movie's title was ""Flight of the Navigator"". Now that I'm an adult, I've now seen it again. I found it to be one fun movie, the sort of thing that anyone would love to experience. Obviously I now recognize a young Sarah Jessica Parker. If the director's name rings a bell, it's because he also directed ""Grease"". I picture Randal Kleiser telling everyone ""Respect the people playing the parents. Remember, the dad was in a band that performed with The Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and the mom worked with Alfred Hitchcock.""* Anyway, a really enjoyable movie. You're sure to love it.*Cliff DeYoung was a member of the '60s group Clear Light, which performed with the aforementioned people. Veronica Cartwright played Rod Taylor's niece in ""The Birds"".",Flight of the Navigator
4,Woodyanders,Magical 80's sci-fi children's adventure romp,9,17 January 2019,"12-year-old David Freeman (a fine and likeable performance by Joey Cramer) disappears for eight years only to find out that nothing is quite the same when he returns home. It turns out that David was whisked away on an alien space craft and now possesses knowledge that's essential for the space craft to complete its mission.Director Randal Kleiser keeps the involving and hugely entertaining story whisking along at a brisk pace, brings an engaging feeling of genuine awe and wonder to the captivating premise, and maintains a tone that's sweet and breezy, but fortunately never becomes too cloying or cutesy. Moreover, the character of David actually undergoes a nice transitional arc in which he learns to take charge of his own life and be more considerate to his younger brother. The sound acting by the capable cast helps a lot: Cliff De Young and Veronica Cartwright as David's concerned and puzzled parents, Howard Hesseman as deceitful scientist Dr. Louis Farraday, Matt Adler as the cool and helpful teen version of David's younger brother Jeff, and Sarah Jessica Parker as spunky intern Carolyn McAdams. Paul Reubens provides the exuberant voice of spaceship pilot Max. In addition, the spacecraft boasts a novel and original design, the aerial photography is breathtaking, and the nifty special effects hold up pretty well. Kudos are also in order for James Glennon's glossy cinematography and Alan Silvestri's bouncy score. A total delight.",Flight of the Navigator
5,ccthemovieman-1,Disney's Problems In the '80s - Exhibit A,1,13 May 2006,"This picture is a perfect example - maybe the best example - of why the Disney company went into the dumper by the mid-80s and had to be ""saved"" a few years later by a new regime which restored the Disney name to prominence in the film industry.Why was this ""Disney film"" an example of how the film company had gone downhill? Well, let's see.....there were two s-words, one bast--d, one GD, one Jesus, etc. etc - yes, this was a ""Disney film."" In addition to the profanity that had not been in Disney films of the past, it had a stupid, annoying 12-year-old brat in the lead and enough holes in the story to start the proverbial swiss cheese factory. It was just plain dumb.Thankfully, new owners put this company back on track with some higher-quality films in the next decade. This film was a disgrace.",Flight of the Navigator
6,bevo-13678,Best kids movie ever!!!!!,10,29 March 2020,"Awesome kids movie. Has it all, a space ship, funny robot, cute girl and an awesome soundtrack",Flight of the Navigator
7,hitchcockthelegend,David and the compliant Phaleon.,7,6 January 2013,"Flight of the Navigator is directed by Randal Kleiser and is adapted to screenplay by Michael Burton and Matt MacManus from a story by Mark H. Baker. It stars Joey Cramer, Veronica Cartwright, Cliff De Young, Sarah Jessica Parker, Howard Hesseman and the voice of Paul Reubens. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography is by James Glennon and Eric McGraw.Young David Freeman (Cramer) is out in the woods near his home in Fort Lauderdale when he falls down a ravine and is knocked unconscious. Waking up he finds that the world around him has advanced by 8 years but he hasn't. After being reunited with his overjoyed parents, it becomes apparent that David has had an encounter with a extra terrestrial life form, which of course greatly interests the authorities...It's a family friendly sci-fi with a difference, in that it doesn't have to take us into space for its tale, yet this in no way detracts from how enjoyable Flight of the Navigator is. It is told from young David's perspective (with Cramer impressionable), thus it firmly engages the kids in the audience. The relationship between David and the Phaleon computer system (Reubens) engages with witty chatter and educational purpose, and the effects work should not be taken for granted either. If we are to be picky then the build up is a touch long before the pic goes ""extra terrestrial"", and Cartwright and De Young are barely given time to impact as parents coming to terms with a family life turned upside down. But small complaints really and this is a lovely film, one that isn't just for 1980s nostalgists. 7/10",Flight of the Navigator
8,utgard14,"""Compliance!""",7,17 December 2013,"Fun sci-fi family movie about a twelve year-old boy (Joey Cramer) who disappears and returns eight years later, still twelve years old and unaware he's been missing. At the same time, NASA finds a spaceship but are unable to open it. NASA attempts to hold the boy against his will, but he escapes on board the spaceship. Paul Reubens is great as the voice of Max, the ship's computer.This is an awesome '80s movie. A good story told with nice special effects and lots of heart. The cast is terrific. In addition to Cramer and Reubens, there's Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role, Veronica Cartwright and Cliff De Young as the boy's parents, and Howard Hesseman as the film's antagonist.",Flight of the Navigator
9,Boba_Fett1138,Good for the right audience.,6,18 August 2010,"As a kids movie, this one is definitely one of the better ones out there. This is simply stuff that the kids will enjoy watching. It tells the entire story from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, which means that the entire perception of the world and the people that are living in it are also costumed to that of a 12 year old. And I like that in all honesty. It's what makes this a good kids movie, which makes me wish more movies would had picked this approach. Hollywood these days seems to have no idea what kids like and how they should market and make movies for them. Just go back to some '80's movies and take notes.But having said all that, this movie is definitely not a great one. It had really a potentially great and adventurous concept but the movie did far too little with all of it. There is just not a whole lot happening in this movie movie. Story- and character-wise it's a quite poorly developed one. There is no villain, there is no real danger or conflict and the good original ideas that this movie had did not get developed or wrapped up properly. If the entire movie had been more like its first half the movie and its story could had really gone somewhere good and interesting. It could had been an ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" kind of movie, which this movie also seemed to have been really 'inspired' by in the first place. But instead of developing some more depth and interesting real emotions, the movie decides that it would be fun to set the movie aboard a spaceship, that's flying around the world, without ever letting anything exciting or tense happen.The story just doesn't make much sense. Not that that seems to matter much for a kids movie but it of course does. Children are not stupid and they just don't take anything for granted, which is something this movie doesn't really always seem to take in consideration with its story. They didn't put enough effort in it, which makes the movie a mostly bland one.Nevertheless the movie remains a fun, light one, especially for kids, since of its approach, that tells the story from the viewpoint and perspective of an 12 year old. Therefore I can say that the movie serves its purpose and for the right audience it's simply being a good one.It's also a real decent looking one. It's a Disney movie, who always knows how to spend some real money on these type of movies. The fact that this movie had the money and the backing of a big studio behind them means that this movie can do more than the usual average one, within this genre. They did not only got some big name actors to star in this movie but they also spend some money on its good looking effects. When you take into consideration that this is an 1986 movie. you have to conclude that the special effects in this movie were being quite good for its time. So nothing wrong with its cast or crew basically.It's good and entertaining enough throughout, especially for kids but yet it seemed to had some far more potential, which got wasted by a below par and not adventurous or fun enough script.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Flight of the Navigator
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pleasant landing,7,18 August 2008,"I watched this on television, seemingly cut for such. I think I expected different things of this, but I can't claim that it's poorly done. The acting, perhaps excepting any other kid(which there weren't many of) than the main one, is rather solid. The plot isn't bad, and they did employ an actual scientific theory. The pacing is remarkable, this flows and flies smoothly. The writing is good and consistent, albeit viewers are required to accept stuff that strains suspension of disbelief. The humor is plentiful, with no overdone gags or jokes, if repetition and silliness(I could have done without the gross-out material, even if there isn't that much of it, and the fact that it was confined to a single scene) are apparent throughout this, and the entire thing, partially also clear in the tone, while that isn't that bothersome, is directed at children. I must admit that it is done with care. The cinematography and editing are talented. The effects are fantastic, and not just for the time, with realistic reflection and fluid motion. There is a little language in it, maybe harsh at least considering who its intended audience is. There is nothing else that parents may deem inappropriate for their offspring, save for a couple of actions that can be imitated(and definitely shouldn't be). I recommend this to those who enjoy lighthearted sci-fi fare, in particular those who can appreciate that kind of film not being, or having to be, stupid. 7/10",Flight of the Navigator
11,view_and_review,Pee-Wee the UFO,7,8 August 2019,"David Freeman (Joey Cramer) was a regular 12-year-old boy living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida until he fell into a ditch and was knocked unconscious. When he awoke things had drastically changed. For him it was merely four hours later but for everyone else it was eight years later. He discovered this massive time shift when his house was occupied by new people.At this same time NASA got a hold of a UFO with no discernible way of entering it until they became aware of David. David would eventually be drawn to the spaceship--which spoke--and the two of them went on a high speed adventure.Along with giving us Paul Reubens aka Pee-Wee Herman as a voice for the ship we got some other 1980's specific nuggets. Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker) reminded us that from 1978 to 1986 music videos were created, rock groups had weird names like Twisted Sister, computers and robotics were on the uptick, and coke had at least four types (New Coke, Classic Coke, Cherry Coke, and Caffeine Free Coke). This movie should've been put in a time capsule.The movie was really about David and the ship's adventure. The ship was standard robot speak for a bit until it began to sound more like Pee-Wee Herman. This was a fun mildly exciting movie that is perfectly suited for kids.",Flight of the Navigator
12,Mr-Fusion,1986: The movie!,7,12 June 2012,"What's strange about ""Flight of the Navigator"" is that it's really two different movies, and they work pretty well together. It's marketed as an adventure flick with a boy and his buddy robot spaceship, but that doesn't actually kick in for a good 45 minutes. Up until that point, David Freeman's an unsolved mystery, missing for 8 years, and there's some dramatic subject matter here for a kids movie (Disney, no less).But then they find each other and that's where the movie really gets its footing. Joey Cramer and Paul Reubens have a good working chemistry; Reubens (and some good puppeteering) breathe some real life into Max, I was surprised.This is one of those movies I'd watched a lot as a kid, and still holds up today. Mainly as an '80s movie. Even though David was a prisoner at NASA, they filled his room with some nice merch; that's what you tend to remember about a movie at that age. As an adult I wouldn't mind having his family's waterfront house. And that synth score really sticks out (this is a positive).It's a movie I did not mind revisiting.7/10",Flight of the Navigator
13,elo-equipamentos,A promising time travel science fiction into a naïve romp!!!,7,14 September 2020,"A time travel science fiction systematically drawn attention for everyone who cherish this sub-genre, Flight of the Navigator has a great premise developed on first section of movie with a dramatic proposition, the concept design about a boy David (Joey Cramer) who felt down in a ravine nearby his home stays oblivious for a while and was taken by an Alien Spacecraft for a study, staying few hours on space only, however a miscalculation happened and he is delivers back on Earth eight years ahead of it's time, therefore he doesn't age a thing, what a shock for a little boy finding your parents older, somehow and luckily the small spacecraft hits in a tower of power transmission on the city outskirts and has been caught by Nasa's staff, soon they connecting the things between the advance spacecraft and David, thus he was convinced by Dr. Louis Faraday (Howard Hesseman) to help them just for 48 hours at Nasa complex to figure out out thru his brain and spacecraft interplay, sadly on last section the movie drops tragically and becomes suddenly in a teenage comedy, changing the beguiling whole concept into a naïve romp, irreparable harm already maiming the promising picture at point of no return!!Resume:First watch: 2002 / How many: 3 / Source: Cable TV-DVD / Rating: 7",Flight of the Navigator
14,Robert_duder,A stone cold Disney CLASSIC!!,9,26 April 2007,"I will tell you right from the start that this review will be incredibly biased because this has always been one of my favorite films since I was a little boy. I know it probably realistically pulls off a 8/10 MAX (no Pun intended) but for myself and for anyone who can let go of their reality and witness a terrific science fiction adventure as though you were 12 years old will not be disappointed. The Flight of The Navigator was dead center of the eighties film craze that saw brilliant sci-fi fantasy epics like Star Trek movies, Back To The Future, Short Circuit, E.T., Batteries Not Included, Gremlins...the eighties was a film genre of it's own. This film fits right into that genre perfect and delivers an experience unlike anything ever seen. This was before the days of CGI enhanced films and special effects that were computer generated and in a day and age where things had to be done by hand and puppets. Director Randal Kleiser did something amazing with the budget, effects, cast and story and created a mesmerizing adventure that I think is one of his more under rated works next to his hit cult classics Grease and The Blue Lagoon.Young star Joey Cramer does a brilliant job as David Freeman, the older brother and typical 'almost' teenager who is sent into a terrifying and yet amazing world where everyone around him has aged nearly ten years except him and he meets a friend that's out of this world. Cramer is in some ways the typical 'Disney' kid. But anyone can relate to him and his world and they do such an amazing job of capturing how this experience would feel finding yourself launched ten years into the future but having not aged a single day. You'll recognize regular character actors Veronica Cartwright and Cliff De Young as David's parents, both of them doing a great job with their smaller roles and carrying the incredible effect of having aged past their son. A young and very cute Sarah Jessica Parker plays the friendly Carolyn McAdams who befriends David at the NASA research facility, and Howard Hesseman is decent in his small role as the lead researcher at NASA who wants to study and protect David at once. Matt Adler is David's older brother but younger technically. Finally although credited at the end as 'Paul Mall' Trimaxion (or Max as he's known) is voiced by none other than Paul 'Pee Wee' Reubans who you can't miss as the voice. Nowadays the voice of Pee Wee Herman comes across as almost annoying and is more of a bad joke than anything but this film was released when Pee Wee Herman was all the rage and Reubans was a star to children. I almost found Max's voice annoying this time around but it never bothered me as a kid. Most of the parts in the film with the exception of David and Max are fairly small but everyone does a great job and carry the film wonderfully.One of the truly brilliant things about Flight of The Navigator is their is NO antagonist, no villains. There are perhaps character with questionable motives but the entire film works without a villain. Instead the film relies on the quest for this boy to find his place in a world moved on without him and to figure out where he's been. Scenes of true brilliance include the actual flight once the ship escapes, the creatures inside Max all waiting to be returned home, and Max and David swaying and dancing to The Beach Boys...all classic Disney film. The Flight of The Navigator is a sure fire hit with kids and kids at heart. If you've never taken in the adventure...well you need to!! 9/10",Flight of the Navigator
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Compliance!,6,10 June 2021,"'Flight Of The Navigator (1986)' is a bit weird in the sense that it sort of shifts from one film to another just over halfway through. However, it remains a generally entertaining experience right the way through and, in some ways, it's actually rather interesting. This intrigue is most prevalent in its first half, as its set-up is actually rather unexpected and it subsequently explores some fairly distinct sci-fi elements. The second half features the sense of adventure you'd expect from this sort of thing, and it's typically successful. The visual effects are rock-solid for the time (there's some impressive CGI that calls to mind the technical prowess of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)', even though this is an older film) and the piece is pacy enough to keep you engaged until it's over. It does make some odd choices, including an incredibly annoying acting decision / direction that becomes prevalent as the picture enters its third act, and it feels quite inconsequential on the whole. It probably won't stay in your memory for very long. Still, it's an enjoyable, light-hearted family flick that mostly holds up. 6/10.",Flight of the Navigator
16,ericstevenson,It's good enough,7,12 April 2018,"I only watched this because Doug Walker said it was in his Top 10 Favorite Disney films. While the movie is certainly fine, I don't think it's great. This movie tells the story of a boy who, one night is knocked unconscious to find out eight years have passed. It's because he was abducted by an alien spaceship causing time to move differently. He doesn't remember what happened. Now, here's the thing that really does bother me about this film.It is literally never explained exactly how or why the boy's memory was erased. Still, this is a finely acted film and I do really like the kid in this. It seems to be partly inspired by ET, a far superior film of course. Some people think the first half is great and the second half is just okay, but I enjoy both parts. It helps that the buildup is so good. I don't know why Paul Reubens was billed as Paul Mill. ***",Flight of the Navigator
17,A_Different_Drummer,IMDb score too low... COMPLIANCE!,10,10 December 2013,"I have tried to ferret out from the IMDb database unique one-of-a-kind films that not only do their job (entertain) but also lack analogues, so that even if you want to compare them to something, you simply can't. This is one of my faves. It is astonishing that no one at Disney has tried to re-do it? Other reviewers here have ably covered the story. What they may have neglected to explain perhaps is how astonishing this tale is for the period (the 80s) and the audience (kids?). C'mon there are episodes of Star Trek that don't deal with as many issues of time travel, time paradox, time dilation (age differences) and ... for a kicker .. moral complexities. In a kid's film? G'mme a break. Astonishing little gem, great acting, and even the voice of the ship is well cast. My last word? COMPLIANCE!",Flight of the Navigator

19,tomgillespie2002,"Imaginative and fun, if unnecessarily dumbed down in the second half",6,31 August 2011,"In Florida, 1978, 12-year old David Freeman (Joey Cramer) goes looking for his brother in the woods and accidentally falls into a ravine. He awakes shortly after to find his parents gone from their home, and everything changed. When the police eventually locate his parents and re-unite them, it turns out that they reported David missing eight years ago. He is examined by doctors, but his brain starts to transmit images of an alien spacecraft directly into the computers. When NASA hear about it, they are quick to take David away for further tests, after a craft was discovered crashed into power lines. They soon learn that David's head is filled with information about the outer reaches of space, and David feels like he is being beckoned by something hidden in the confines of NASA.This was an obvious favourite of mine as a child, as it was for many of my generation. Whilst I was re-watching, I was surprised by two things. The first is that I remembered next to nothing about the opening 45 minutes or so, yet as soon as David became the Navigator, it all came flooding back to me. And the second was that I couldn't believe how genuinely good the first half was. Playing out like an early Spielberg sci-fi, where all the grown-ups are suspicious and shady with their suits and broken promises, it builds slowly and is actually quite riveting in parts. The second half, however, although fun, just doesn't play well alongside the mature opening half. It introduces Max (voiced by Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens - here named as Paul Mall), who after bonding with David, develops a silly voice and annoying laugh, a la Pee-Wee Herman.It is quite ironic that what I loved about the film as a child is now the thing that I feel ultimately lets it down. Maybe I have become a grumpy old man at the ripe old age of 27. It doesn't completely ruin the film, just brings it down a peg. It's very disappointing, as the need to seemingly dumb down to appeal to a young audience being fed on quality like The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Crystal and E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial around the same period just feels unnecessary. Not that it would have touched on those films, but it still could have been very good nonetheless. But apart from the sudden change of tone, this is a childhood favourite for a reason - it is fun, imaginative, and has a sympathetic hero in Joey Cramer's David. And if a film can survive an early appearance from one of cinema's true monsters, Sarah Jessica Parker, then good on it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Flight of the Navigator

21,drqshadow-reviews,"Light, Kid-Geared Science Fiction From a Bygone Age",6,26 May 2021,"An upper-middle class kid from Miami falls into a dark, spooky ravine, bumps his head and wakes up eight years later, physically unchanged. While undergoing tests at the local hospital, his brain waves hijack the electronic monitoring equipment to display star charts and spaceship schematics. This quickly draws the attention of NASA, who have just captured a matching craft, and they take him in for further evaluation.I think any kid who came of age in the '80s saw this multiple times, like a rite of passage, so there's a certain amount of nostalgia at play that's tough to overstate. It looks like the '80s, acts like the '80s, most definitely sounds like the '80s, and that feels intrinsically warm and welcoming to middle-agers like me. Hey, I can still remember seeing boxes of Transformers in the kid's temporary bedroom, cheap trinkets to make him feel at-home inside the cold government testing facility, and wishing we could swap places.Viewing it now, as an adult, I think the aura is nice and enjoyed the entry-level explanation of how light speed travel can cause such weird time paradoxes. But, despite the intriguing premise and challenging first act, the plot doesn't really go anywhere spectacular. All the momentum pushes us toward the ship, yet when we finally climb aboard, there isn't much to see. After ogling all the chrome fixtures, making nice with the AI (voiced by an ascending Paul Reubens) and browsing an onboard zoo of Muppet critters, we just sort of joyride around the country for a little while, dodge a few helicopters and go home.

22,arthur_tafero,Mildly Entertaining - Flight of the Navigator,6,18 September 2021,"Two successful films have been made in sci-fi about alternative universes; this one and Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, which was also mildly entertaining. Both films are a bit short on the scientific aspects of travel to and from alternate universes (if they exist), but they are fun, nevertheless. It was a waste of money to employ Veronica Cartwright, Sarah Jessica Parker and Howard Hesseman; three talented actors, for roles that could have been played by local theater groups, as no one cares at all about any of those characters. The stars are Cramer (who would be in Seinfeld in another alternate universe), the ship and the robot. That's all folks, as Porky Pig would say. Not much of a plot or very many complications, other than the fact that NASA is portrayed as an incompetent group of nitwits. (using guns to intimidate a far superior technology lol).

The special effects haven't aged amazing, yet they still suitably serve the intended purpose.Joey Cramer is good in the lead role as David, while Paul Reubens is fairly amusing as Max. A young Sarah Jessica Parker (Carolyn) also appears. The film doesn't quite hit the intended heartfelt spots with the plot, but there is an element of care for David from me in there minorly; if only at the end.Decent Disney.",Flight of the Navigator

How could a film so cool and interesting be made by a company like Disney? With the speculation aside, this film was one of those films I always wished I was in. Coupled with good creature effects and some really entertaining cultural differences between the 70s and 80s, this film was entertaining to say the least, even if it is a bit dated in respect to special effects and what not. Nonetheless, I will always watch this film if its on television.",Flight of the Navigator
25,adamjohns-42575,This is why kids shouldn't walk through the woods alone at night!,3,31 August 2021,"Would I have found it more enjoyable as an 8 year old? I'm not sure it would have kept my attention for long enough! It's very typical of 80's films, but without that certain something that makes films like Goonies (1985) and 'Explorers' (1985) absolute classics. Even 'Batteries Not Included' (1987) was more exciting than this though for me.Maybe I did show up to the party a few decades late, but I do recall trying to watch this one a long time ago when I'd recorded it on VHS and deciding, before I'd even got to the first advert break, that the tape would be better used to record Star Trek episodes instead.Personally I preferred Max before he turned in to Peewee Herman, but I can see that it was meant for kids. With that in mind, I actually found it a bit traumatic and horrifying to think that this poor lad had been displaced and the upset that it caused. I certainly wouldn't have released him to the military so soon if he was my son returned home. Perhaps the producers were trying to show kids the effects running away might have on their families?Nobody was particularly bad and the kid did a good job, but there were no stand out performances or any amazing effects or direction to write home about.",Flight of the Navigator
26,vertigo_14,Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage!,7,27 April 2004,"Flight of the Navigator is one of those terrific adventure films for kids, even after all these years. It also falls into a long line of fun 80s sci-fi/adventure family movies.Davey (Joey Cramer) goes into the woods looking for his little brother one evening in 1978. When he wakes up after a brief period of unconsciousness, he turns into a scientific marvel. Nothing is as Davey remembers it, but he can't figure out why because he only fell asleep for a brief period.Davey is told that his parents reported the young boy missing in 1978, the evening that he went searching in the woods for his younger brother, referring to the incident in the past tense because it is 1985. Only Davey is still exactly the same age and everything he was from 1978, while time has passed for everyone else. His little brother is now his big brother (Matt Adler). His parents are old. Everyone is confused and the scientific world find the situation fascinating.The scientists turn Davey into their personal guinea pig, running tests and probing him and all that junk. And soon they discover, that Davey was abducted. Davey, understandably a confused little kid, can't figure out what's going on and he sure doesn't want to be locked up in some lab where people prod at him all day long and tell him very little. So, he breaks lose, and hops aboard the spaceship that took him through time before. While it is an escape from the scientists and their security (briefly), it also holds the answers to what happened to him. It is also an opportunity for Davey to learn everything from this spaceship. And a kid's movie isn't complete without personifying inanimate objects. The spaceship is essentially controlled by Max, which is like it's CPU, a CPU with a cool sense of humor who likewise tries to learn about human emotions and condition from his passenger, Davey. Filmed around Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, it is still a cool movie for kids...teenagers...whatever, having a little bit of something for everyone. Great humor, cool special effects, and the like.",Flight of the Navigator
27,mentalcritic,One of the ugliest collisions of Disney and sci-fi,2,27 May 2007,"As one of the sites linked to this IMDb entry states, one of Disney's first business-driven forays into live-action film drove the film industry in a new direction. It was the first time that the science fiction genre was treated in an adult manner. From then on, Disney and science fiction had a relationship that was occasionally interesting, but as examples like Flight Of The Navigator demonstrate, usually quite abyssic. Part of the problem is the clash of messages, but the real problem lies in the same place as the problem every film of this mould, the adult genre brought to child sensibilities, lies. Namely, the film aims at children and makes the assumption that because its audience is made up of children, it can treat that audience with less respect. If anything, the children of the 1980s were an even more sophisticated audience than the children of the present, and thus, Flight Of The Navigator was firmly ignored at the box office. It was pretty much ignored on the then-maturing home video market, too, come to think of it.Part of the problem is that Flight is not just ignorant of the culture of both eras represented. It goes to absurd lengths to insult it. While I grant that I was barely two months old at the end of 1978, I know enough about the time to know that a twelve year old of the era would experience far less culture-shock when teleported to 1986 than would be the case if he were teleported to 2006. This is hilariously ignored in the moment when the protagonist meets a glorified janitor, played by an incredibly young (but still staggeringly ugly) Sarah Jessica Parker. While the existence of multiple Coca-Cola varieties in 1986 would surprise any visitor from the 1970s, music video was in fact quite an intrinsic marketing tool well before 1978, with a variety of artists such as Black Sabbath or David Bowie using the medium to an effect that was almost half as artistic (or just as much in the latter's case) as their music. One viewing of the promo video for John, I'm Only Dancing will confirm this much.It is important to keep this in mind during such scenes as when David is ""educating"" Max about music. As I sit here and listen to a song that consists of a grinding bass guitar overlaid with one of the most instantly-recognisable drum patterns and a violin that brings tears to the eyes as the vocalist roars in Latin about what is essentially the story of a man being tortured to death, I realise that scene will never fail to creep me out. Given that Max is capable of travelling through time, across light years of space, and has enough memory to store the complete works of Ian Fleming a million times over, I can only think of one response such an entity would have to a child like David. At one point in the conversation, I see Max telling him to grow the hell up. At another, I see Max ditching David in complete annoyance. For certain, it would be another ten years before the Internet did to cultural hegemony what television did to the film industry, but pity for ignorance is soon replaced by anger when the exhibitor mistakes it for something to take pride in.Furthering the problem is a voice performance by Paul Reubens, or Paul Mall as he is credited here. Quite honestly, if someone had directed me to deliver a voice-over as screechy, irritating, and nonsensical as was the case here, I would be making certain that nobody knew I was involved. For the most part, it seems to be the script's fault, but at a moment after Max extracts data he placed in David's head for reasons that make no sense using a process that makes no sense for reasons that make no sense, Paul feels the need to shout/scream every line. If you go and buy an elderly pig, set it in your back yard, then stab it to death with a butter knife, you will get some idea of the kind of sound I am talking about. It hurts to listen to, and when you combine that with the horrid tone of the script, it only makes me hate the film even more. I often joke that people who block lines in supermarkets out in suburban or rural towns should be dumped in the Los Angeles CBD for a day. Well, David really deserves to be left in the middle of Los Angeles circa 2007 for a year or three.Does this mean that the film is a total write-off? Well, there are a couple of saving graces such as Howard Hesseman as a scientist who only seeks to find a rational explanation for David's disappearance, or Matt Adler as the elder version of David's brother. In contrast to Parker or Joey Cramer, they are endearing and create characters one can sympathise with. Not that this bothered Disney accountants during production. Who cares if the protagonist is a narrow-minded little twerp who revolts the most stratified segments of the potential audience, right? Well, given that The Goonies was released a year earlier, made twenty times the money, and was given the red carpet treatment on DVD recently, I think history has rendered its verdict on this nauseating load of ""family friendly"" syrup. In some commentaries about films, I have said that it is rare when a film that claims to be appealing to audiences of that mythical every age really does so. In case I have not already made it clear, Flight Of The Navigator makes the claim when in fact it does the exact opposite.Flight Of The Navigator is a two out of ten film, personnified.",Flight of the Navigator
28,johno-21,Good family fantasy adventure flick,8,22 March 2006,"I'm one of the few here to comment on this movie who didn't see it as a child. I din't see this until sometime in the 1990's when I was in my 40's and it came on the Disney channel so I decided to check it out. I was surprised that it was a Disney movie as most Disney films are pretty well advertised but I had never heard of this before. A Disney family film geared for kids wouldn't have brought me into a theater to see it anyway so if I did hear about I just dismissed it and forgot about it. In the story, a 12 year old boy is somehow abducted by aliens and transported hundreds of light years from earth to their planet and then sent back in what amounts to only four hours of his life but on earth eight years have passed and the late 1970's kid finds himself back home in the mid 1980's. The movies first half is darker and more thought provoking and grabs your attention but then the movie becomes light and silly but that's OK as it's a good movie. Randal Kleiser directs. He had a big hit with Blue Lagoon and an even bigger one that he will always be remembered for in Grease but has had a lot of bad movies in his career. Although this is dated it has more of that enduring quality to it like his film Grease has. Kleiser's brother Jeffrey Kleiser is among a team of noted special effects and visual effects creators on this film including Ron Goodman, Bret Mixon and Peter Donen. Joey Cramer, whose acting career never materialized stars in an ensemble cast that includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Veronica Cartwright, Howard Hessman and the voice of Paul Reubens. This is a good family fantasy adventure movie and worth a look. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.",Flight of the Navigator
29,rainking_es,Mythical!,7,2 February 2006,"I watched ""The Flight Of The Navigator"" for the first time (the only one, actually) 15 years ago or so. I don't know, maybe I was feeling a little nostalgic lately, and I decided to watch it again. Now, I must say the movie remains as funny and imaginative as I remembered. OK, maybe the special effects, the music, the clothes are a little bit old-fashioned, but that's inevitable (specially for the 80's productions) and it doesn't detract from the excitement of the story.Is it my impression or they does not make movies like this (for the kids) anymore? Well, I guess the children nowadays would wet themselves out of products like ""TFOTN"". They'll sure prefer elfs and Hobbuits stuff, or jap cartoons beating the hell out of each other... Anyway, this is one of the most mythical movies for the kids of the 80's (as good as Goonies or Explorers), one of the few Disney productions that are not sickly sweet.*My rate: 7/10",Flight of the Navigator

That's because I found elements in common with the films in question. Not the most original movie, then...While not tremendous, I prefer this anytime over that mediocrity called 'Grease'. This comparison only takes place because both were directed by the same person.This is the story of David Scott Freeman (decently but not greatly played by Joey Cramer, a Henry Thomas look-alike), an American 12-year-old boy who lives in 1978. In one Summer night, he mysteriously ends up in the year 1986 after a fall. Naturally, he finds out that everything around him is no longer the same. He panics and falls in despair because he doesn't understand what is going on. Although he is taken to his family, he is the only one who hasn't aged at all.David is taken to medical examinations to find out why he has the same age after 8 years but is forced to stay more 48 hours, to which he reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, he finds out that he has to stay longer than the promised 48 hours and he can't take it anymore and that's when his journey to return to his family begins... with the help of a talking time-machine nicknamed ""Max"" by him.Overall, it's an okay movie although a little sappy.

32,johnstonjames,Omg. Totally Cute. Totally Disney. Totally 80's.,8,12 May 2011,"omg. omg. every time i watch stuff like this i feel like 'StarSearch' is back on television and it's the 80's all over again. this movie is even better than i remember it. as usual, another under-appreciated Disney classic from the much maligned period of the Disney 80's films.the Disney films from the 1980's are usually thought of by most critics and audience fans as underwhelming and forgettable. i'm starting to think that belief couldn't be further from the truth. i've always really liked Disney movies from the 1980's and have tried to defend them to detractors whenever i could. 'The Black Cauldron' and 'The Black Hole' are two of my all time Disney favorites along with the long under-appreciated 'Tron'. i actually would have liked to have given 'Navigator' ten stars since it was so quirky and entertaining, but given the lightness of the approach and subject matter, i felt a eight was probably more realistic. i'm not sure if i'm even right on this because the Disney films of the 1980's just seem to get better and better with each passing time period. i mean heck, if you're a true Disney fan, some of the 80's Disney films were some of the last produced at the Disney studio in Burbank.'Navigator' makes for imaginative children's sci fi and excellent Disney. much of this movie is down right hilarious with a lot of the quirky humour aided and abetted by the fabulous Paul Reubens who strangely is listed as Paul Mall here. the sci fi FX also compete with some of the best CGI to date.if you haven't seen this delightful little Disney gem, then i don't want to spoil the clever fun by revealing to much about it. part of the film's impact is it's element of surprising originality.this really is memorable stuff. and classic Disney. in our recent times when so much seems to have gone to waste morally, it's always a breath of fresh air to see something as wholesome and unoffensive as this in mainstream, media entertainment. there is no swearing, no hint of sexual suggestion, no substance use, and no violence. that prospect might bore most kids today, but their parents would be smart to at least encourage them to try a little with this kind of thing. man does not live by cynicism alone. a little true optimism and wholesome thinking can't hurt. not when times get as morally bankrupt as these.

33,Superunknovvn,Forgotten little 80's adventure movie,6,23 April 2006,"""Flight Of The Navigator"" is a kids movie and as such it has every right not to really make sense. In other words everybody who tries to pick it apart and tries to find plot holes is a hopeless geek who takes things too seriously. This movie isn't even trying to convey a coherent story.Nonetheless, it is a bit disappointing that after the first very strong half the movie kind of drifts into an amusement park ride with the main character just flying around in the alien ship. That may be fun to watch for kids who also like ""Knight Rider"", but it's kind of tedious for anybody who's a fan of actual storytelling. Ultimately, it's the movie's gimmicky, but plot less second half that prevented ""Flight Of The Navigator"" from becoming a box office hit, let alone a classic like ""E.T."". That's a bit of a pity since the direction and especially the special effects hold up extremely well to this day and could have made for a much more memorable motion picture.If you like adventure movies with a nostalgic 80's feel to them, ""Flight Of The Navigator"" will not fail to entertain you on a Saturday afternoon.

40,cosmic_quest,Great fun,7,10 August 2006,"'Flight of the Navigator' might have been produced in the mid-Eighties but it certainly hasn't lost it's charm over the last twenty years and it does stand up well against more recent family film offerings.The story begins in 1978 with twelve-year-old David Freeman, a happy all-American kid who lives with his loving parents and typically bratty eight-year-old brother Jeff. One night he sets off into the woods to look for Jeff only to be knocked unconscious when he falls from a ravine. When David awakes in what seems like hours later to him, he discovers actually eight years have passed and it is now 1986. Although he is still twelve years old, the world has moved on and even his little brother is older than he is. NASA are very interested in David when his EEG scan reveal readings in the shape of a UFO they have discovered and other scans of the boy result in star charts of distant galaxies being spewed out from the computers. But our hero is determined to return to his family so he breaks free and hides aboard the UFO which holds the key to everything.Joey Cramer gives a likable performance as David, a boy who enjoys adventures but ultimately just wants to be with his family. I think anyone watching the film would empathise with his character's anger and sense of helplessness when David discovers NASA have no intention of letting him go home. Matt Adler as sixteen-year-old Jeff is another notable actor in the film in the way he depicts his character's uncertainty of dealing with his little big brother and his developing protectiveness towards David. Also, look out for a younger Sarah Jessica Parker.For those who watched 'Flight of the Navigator' as children in the Eighties, there is definitely a nostalgic feeling to it. However, I think children of present day would still enjoy the film as it has a little of everything and issues raised as still relevant and/or interesting today such as pre-teen crushes, annoying kid brothers, the thrill of following a hero on his 'quest', a fun mentor for the hero (even if it is metallic!) and arrogant scientist-types. It is important to remember that this is a children's film aimed very much at an eight- to twelve-year-old demography so it doesn't delve too deeply but the plot is quite unique, the characters are interesting and it is a film that is well put-together. Certainly one to enjoy with the whole family.",Flight of the Navigator

42,mirosuionitsaki2,"Instant Classic, and New Arrival..",9,2 March 2008,"After just finishing watching this movie, I'm quite happy I've watched it. Although, there are scenes that I really think are too common in Disney movies. But, I think I can just forgive that. If you are into Disney Family movies, and you are into characters meeting new friends but having to leave them for some reason, you will enjoy this movie. This movie could be the spiritual sequel to E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, along with many other movies that can be it's spiritual predecessor and successor in Disney movies.A 12 year old boy, David Freeman, was on his way to search for his little brother who would be returning from his friends house and would be going to the woods. David's mother thought that would be dangerous, so David should have to get him. David falls into a ditch, only to be awoken eight years later. David finds out that this is all because of some extra terrestrial plot, and he ends up going on a space ship with a robot. This video is fun for the whole family! What's even better, I'm pretty sure that this would be great to look at on a HDTV.What disgusted me, or what I should say I disliked because they weren't really disgusting, was the following scenes I would say. David eventually attempts to teach the robot laughter, music, and the robot eventually reads David's mind and starts talking like a child. This aggravated me and I found the robot to be a little annoying and not very serious. But, I also found this to be quite entertaining. Eventually, the robot will get back to his normal self in the end, but at the very end, the robot talks like a child again. I also hated that this featured annoying words such as, ""dork, geek,"" etc. But, you should remember that this was in the 1980s and this is a Disney movie.I recommend this movie for all. Well, not for all. There are a few cussing, but it's not common. So far, I remember hearing the ""SH"" word and probably even the ""D"" word that ends with ""mn"", and I've also heard the word ""Hell"". If you don't want to have to spend a few seconds or a minute explaining to your child what that is, don't bother letting that child watch this movie or just don't tell that child what it means.

I'm not the target audience for this movie and I didn't see it when I was a kid so I'm not looking at it with the warm glow of nostalgia. So I guess I'm going to p!ss some people off with this review.The first half of this movie is, not to mince words, great. Even to my middle-aged jaded eyes it is a great start. Nicely acted, nicely paced, and nicely directed ( I loved the opening shot and the 2 subsequent UFOs that weren't). David, the eldest son of a Standard Disney All American Family, slips and falls whilst in the woods one night. Returning home he finds eight years have passed. Simltaniously an alien Space ship has crashed into a power pylon; later the NASA scientists studying it discover that David has information in his head that directly links him with the alien space ship. They start to analyse the knowledge that has been placed in his brain...Up until this point the movie has been building up a nice eerie edge, The scenes where David is reunited with his family have an emotional punch. There is some real tension building up, tension which dissolves almost immediately Sarah Jessica Parker and her obvious plot device on wheels turns up and is only just being built up again when David enters the ship (via the obvious plot device on wheels) As soon as he steps onto the space ship the whole movie just falls flat on its arse.David just flies about a bit then has the star charts which were (for no apparent reason)pumped into his brain during the missing eight years read by the spaceship who managed to loose his copy while crashing into the power line...? What!? Oh come on! This is stupid. Even for a Disney kids movie, this is stupid stupid stupid film-making. The alien robot ship then turns into a cool talking dude, shows him the other 'samples' one of which eats David's hat then belches (a particularly thin and annoying 'joke' that seems to amuse American movie directors and no one else). David teaches the spaceship about music - a space-faring race that has examined dozens of other sentient species, can speak English, and has never heard of music?. Then they fly about for a bit unable to find Florida. When they do get there, via Japan, David decides that he wants to attempt to travel back in time to 1987. He travels back in time. He doesn't disintegrate. He is reunited with his family for the second time in the movie. Was it all a dream? No! He still has the cute little orphaned alien he picked up with him.OK, maybe I'm being harsh here. It's a kids film after all. But it started out so well. It showed great promise. Then it just copped out the second half of the film is just David flying the ship around. There is no threat, no mystery, no plot, no tension. It's boring.

When he finds himself aboard an alien spacecraft, he naturally first attempts to transfer that dependency to the robotic pilot Max, which, all-seeing eye and all, represents the omniscient grown-up. As time goes on, though, David begins to realize that: 1) his own interests do not in fact always coincide with Max's, 2)that therefore he must advocate for himself to achieve a favorable outcome, and 3) that he's the one who has to decide just what outcome will best meet his needs. Much unlike most ""kid movies,"" this character shows real growth, and in the end confronts a real moral and personal dilemma. Whether you agree with his choice or not, you have to respect him for what he has become.",Flight of the Navigator
50,wrightiswright,I loved this film... and still do.,8,22 January 2017,"This is one of those movies where you KNOW it isn't perfect... Did they HAVE to insert in an entirely redundant cute alien creature, for example? And wasn't the spaceship MUCH more appealing with a robotic, apathetic voice at the start then as the jive talking', clownish 'best buddy' that he becomes later? Yes, and YES.But to a kid who grew up with this film, such imperfections don't matter a jot. You were THERE, flying through the sky, plunging into the ocean and almost crash landing into the Earth at the speed of light.Even watching as a adult, the memories still linger... but the film is more than just a mildly pleasant nostalgia trip. Check out the cutting-edge special effects, and the excessively poignant meeting Kevin has with his family in the future where he hasn't aged a day.Pure magic. 8/10",Flight of the Navigator
51,perlshop,Watched this after CD's youtube video,6,6 June 2021,The story is meh but the lengths the director and animators went to to create the ship and everything else is definitely mind blowing. I mean this movie was created in the age when I don't know even a 286 was a big deal.The biggest letdown is after the AI changes its character from compliance to dumb and dumber. If they had a better plot for that this movie would be right up there with ET.,Flight of the Navigator

It's not in the realms of E.

54,Jonathan Horner,Good fantasy tale.,8,19 July 2000,"Flight of the Navigator has always been one of favirote sci-fi movies, ever since I first saw it when I was around 11. The whole movie just interested me. I think it's because at the time I had a fascination for flying saucers and aliens. Plus I thought it would be like E.T which I loved at the time as well.Flight of the Navigator may be pretty old now. But I think it still remains a true classic for children who love fantasy movies. Flight of the Navigator will always interest and amaze a young childs mind despite it's age.It may have not been a block buster hit at the time. But I think a lot of children have re-discovered Flight of the Navigator over the years and enjoy it more than when it first came out.8/10.",Flight of the Navigator
55,Juni78ukr,A classic family movie,9,16 January 2006,"For the fist time I saw Flight of The Navigator when I was a kid, nearly twenty years ago. I remember young soviet kids flocked into the theaters to see a strange American movie and somehow taped it but too many time has passed and all these years it was like a rather unclear distant memory for me, a distant memory of something pretty good and even beautiful. Since then I was unable to find it and watch it again and only recently I caught in on a cable TV channel. Despite being twenty seven years old now I still liked it a lot.Flight of The Navigator is a very good Sci-fi family movie despite (or some people could say thanks to) it is not as overloaded by the special effects as most of such modern movies. That left enough place not only for pure entertainment bit also for emotions and some pretty nice scenes with rather good dialogs. It the story of an eleven years old boy, who after a strange and quite inexplicable contact with something looked like an alien ship got moved through the time into future several years ago, which passed for him like a couple of hours. In this future he takes an adventure to find an explanation what really happened with him. Flight of The Navigator is a very enjoyable movie for whole family, which deserves much more appreciation than overwhelming majority of recent family movies.9 out of 10",Flight of the Navigator

57,carflo,Good SciFi & Good Family Fun & Great Space Ship,8,26 November 2003,Flight of the Navigator is one of my all time favorite movies.  It's quite good as scifi but it is also a good family movie.  I have seen it many times and I always enjoy it.  But the thing I like most about Flight of the Navigator is Max.  Max is an intelligent silver space ship that is probably one of the most beautiful things ever created for a scifi film.  Max shines and glitters like a Cylon but he is not menacing and he is not the villain.  He is a space ship with attitude and some of the funniest lines in the movie are his.I would recommend it for anyone who likes scifi and/or family friendly movies.,Flight of the Navigator

Original director John G. Avildsen wanted to go more Star Wars-y; replacement Randal Kleiser plots a Spielbergian course that leads nowhere surprising but takes some playful detours.

59,GEM-20,Fun in an '80s kind of way,6,31 January 2005,"""Flight Of The Navigator"" was an enjoyable adventure for our family. While some of the visual effects seem somewhat dated, and the story focusing on the boy as it should, the maturity level was not that high. Still, it is better than other Disney films like ""The Cat From Outer Space"".Maturity and intelligence is not what this movie is about. Fun is the bottom line. While this is not something to revisit time and again, it is not a bad addition to my Disney DVD collection. Out of my usual four stars, I would rate this one: **.5 If you are looking for excellent Disney features that hold up to many repeats, check out ""20000 Leagues Under The Sea"" or ""Mary Poppins"".

A young boy is asked by his mother to go get his younger brother from the neighbors. The kid named David, falls down this ravine and hits his head. He passes out and finds himself awake 8 years later and everything has changed including his family. I am not going to wreck the plot anymore you will have to watch this movie. My roommate is already mad at me for spoiling some of the plot because I thought this movie was awesome. And Sarah Jessica Parker is pretty hot as she is sooooooo young in this movie and it was way before her Sex In The City success in the nineties.

63,speedy-droid,A Great Sci-Fi Movie for Kids,8,13 October 2016,"This is one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen for kids, and not just because your kid (about 8 - 12 years old) will love it. The best thing about it is that it takes a more realistic approach to an alien encounter than most adult movies in the present day. The details are a little corny and cheesy... of course... it's a kid's movie. But the basic premise is sound:1) An advanced alien species would most likely be non-belligerent explorers. The alien (actually an alien machine) in this movie views humanity with a kind of indifference, much the same way as humans look at cats... cute, but stupid and primitive.2) Despite their indifference, the aliens don't wantonly destroy life. They are curious about all life, but they don't interfere with it or destroy it. Although aloof, the alien seems sympathetic to all life... he briefly laments that one of the creatures he is observing is now homeless, as his planet was destroyed by a comet.3) The aliens possess advanced technology that the movie doesn't attempt to explain. No tired Star Trek dilithium crystal explanations. We don't even know the alien's true shape, although we assume it's the walnut shape. It can change shape at will. This would be an epic technological breakthrough for humanity, but the second Terminator movie is the only other mainstream movie to explore this idea.If you're into the whole movies as education thing (as I am), you can really engage your kid after watching this movie by discussing what you think aliens would be like.There is no sex, no violence (guns are drawn but not used), and only one or two relatively ""tame"" curse words.",Flight of the Navigator

The ship is externally a giant metal sea shell, internally a set of intricate chrome panels, and the alien is basically a light bulb attached to the ship by a moving metal arm ! An epitomal display of the 1980's unfailing ability to bring aesthetics to the table that are tacky but charming and classy , and archetypal of the good ole' days !A beautiful electronic score - harmonic, eerie and magical - captures the mystery and wander the boy bares toward his alien friend.An interesting early appearance by Sarah Jessica Parker; before she became a dog! Interesting reference to TWISTED SISTER too:-
Sarah J.P : ""We went to a concert last night; Twisted Sister.""
Boy : ""I've never heard of HER .""
Sarah J.P : ""It's a HIM ! ... Actually it's a Them.""Also interesting to bare in mind that this was in the days -1986 - when you could have a Universal-Rated kids film with a couple of 'S' and 'B' words in it; sure, you'd never get away with it now, it would be rated '12'/'PG-13' now !All-in-all, I have to give this film a full 10/10 for being a proper classy, aesthetic and uplifting film, highly evocative of the good ole' 80s, nostalgic for us 80s kids and just GENERALLY PERFECT ! !",Flight of the Navigator

I am very suprised however to see that it didnt do so good in the box office, especially if all of us that have watched this as kids, and continue to watch this today. Flight of the Navigator is clearly a great movie. There was a couple of things they could have cleared up a little better, i guess u can call them goofs, but i caught them just to say a few: When David wakes up 8 years later and climbs out of the ravine and back to the house. As you can clearly notice at the front door that there are now two giant small trees or plants that were not their in 1978. That was a bad call cause if i was david, i would know what my house looks like. Another continuity was when david got dropped back off to 1978 and he climbed out of the ravine, and then the shot where he walked over the train tracks, that was clearly the same scene you saw when he first came out of the ravine in 1986, now in 1978 when we climbs back out it is the same exact shot.

The special effects are believable, the spaceship looks real. I still find myself wondering how they pulled it off. It was 1986, after all.

I wish I could give two ratings, one from me as a kid (probably an 8 or 9) and then one for me as an adult (probably a 3 or 4 at best). To make the compromise I did a 5.The story is fairly original, and the acting is fine. The spaceship effects hold up relatively well. I like the kid (what else did he do?? I feel like I didn't see him in much else). I don't think this is a spoiler, or hope not anyway, but if you're at all concerned with things like then then read no further. One place that really messes the movie up for me though, is when the alien ship AI personality makes a shift from this kind of cool mysterious robot voice, to the voice of Paul Reubens (AKA Pee-Wee Herman, doing his Pee-Wee Herman voice no less). I felt like as a kid this worked, it was kind of hip and cool and fun.

If you have never seen this film, I would recommend it whole-heartedly for the entire family. If it has been sometime since you watched this film I would say check it out, well worth a return visit.One thing I have to mention is the joy I was receiving just watching my children (ages 4 through 8) experience this movie for the first time. Even after all of the Hi-tech movies they have seen in recent years this movie was still able to capture their attention, hold it and entertain just as well as anything in recent memory (such as Spiderman, Hulk or even Spy Kids).My children wanted to re-watch it immediately after it ended, it was that good in their (short attention span) minds.5 out of 5 stars from me and mine. **Although regarding the DVD transfer, it could have used some extra's, even a trailer from the original film, however there were none, simple menu access and set-up options only, enjoyable none-the-less.",Flight of the Navigator

Almost twenty years later, I stumbled upon it here and remembered my fondness of it. I bought it on DVD and again, I still like the film very much.

In fact, had it been distributed by another production company, it might have been a better movie. Why argue that now?

But he finds a lot of shocking changes when he gets back home! The best part was when David (Cramer) returns home and the folks take for a long lost kid or ghost! That was amazing. The UFO and aliens/visitors-from-space addition were also beautifully plotted and executed. The scene where the ship moves above the sea and dives right into the sea still lingers in my mind.

Most who read this know the plot from start to finish and can probably even quote from it like me. Time travel, space exploration, robot and man encounter...Oh, and a great music score! One thing I must say is that I think the time with David and Max could have been expanded and more creative. You know the famous scenes from E.T. at the beginning when the creatures of his type are un-boarding his ship in the forest, we see them, they're exploring and of course the classic ending scene between Elliot and E.T. If Flight of the Navigator could have had something like scenes of David on Phaelon during his study by Max or Max's arrival on Earth to find David and take him to Phaelon; scenes like that could have been phenomenal and added more depth to the film. But, to this day I still admire Flight of the Navigator for what it is. A solid, kind-hearted movie that's easy to follow with excitement and scenes that are unpredictable.

Flight of the Navigator was not the first movie about traveling in time but arguably was the first to visualize UFO spaceship and hyperspace in a high-quality image. Also the idea that UFO can travel not only in space but in time looked pretty fresh. If you were a part of late 1980-s / early 1990-s you probably remember the interest to all this UFO and paranormal stuff and Flight of the Navigator hit those targets. The film is a family oriented movie made by Disney so anyone can watch it with a big pleasure,Flight of the Navigator

91,eruadan,"Opinions and review by Eruadan, August 26, 2000",9,27 August 2000,"I have felt for some time that this film was badly underrated by the critics, as well as by the general public.  I really believe it deserved much better than it got.  I doubt that the average viewer really understood the film.The story deals with what I would call ""alternate realities"".  The film begins with one premise - the problem of missing children.  Add a dose of artificially intelligent alien spaceship, a few other SF concepts, and you have a decent story that postulates at least 4 different possibilities. One of them is exactly what the film showed.  The others would be where David never disappeared; where he never came back; and last where he stayed in the other world where he never really ""fit in"".I had some problems with the overall believability, but I enjoyed the film. Definitely worth bringing back.",Flight of the Navigator

95,g_r_e_g_j_b,One of the best Disney films of the 80s,10,21 March 2005,"I remember watching this movie when I was 2 years old and always watching from then on. I love this movie, it's really a fantastic film for people of all ages. It's the story of David Freeman, a kid who is abducted in 1978 then is returned to Earth 8 years later to 1986, but to him it has only been an hour or two. When he returns, everything has changed except him and he is now the center of a NASA/government investigation. When the spacecraft turns up, David hitches a ride on it and becomes friends with the ship's host(this hardcore robot thing with a great sense of humor). So after getting out of this NASA holding place, David tries to make it home to his future family...or will he risk it all to go back to 1978? It's funny, touching, fascinating, and has top-notch special effects...seriously you will be surprised at how good they are. So see this movie! It's one of a kind!!",Flight of the Navigator
96,randygilpin,An overlooked Disney Classic!,10,9 March 2005,"I can't believe it.......after many years of browsing local video stores, I finally found this movie again!!! Nobody ever had a clue what I was talking about, & looked at me like I was completely crazy, so I finally had to get a subscription to NetFlix, to see it again. I'm a big kid at heart, & enjoyed this movie just as much today, as I did almost 20 years ago. I was always a huge fan of the whole ""Sci-Fi/ Time Travel"" story lines. Flight Of The Navigator, Voyagers, The Time Machine, & Sliders were at the top of my list.About 5 years ago, I was in Florida, & saw the ""Navigator"" spaceship just sitting in storage, in a studio ""junkyard."" It was great to see it, but kind of a crappy way to display it. So much more could be done with it. Anyway, sorry to ramble on. If you like the kind of genres that I mentioned above, but haven't seen this movie, I suggest you give it a try.I had forgotten that Sarah Jessica Parker was in this movie, fresh from her ""Square Pegs"" look. I read that the kid who starred in this movie (Joey Cramer) only did a handful of movies/ TV appearances, and dropped from the public eye. His whereabouts are listed as ""unknown"" today.Pay attention Disney guys, this needs to be re-released next year for it's 20th anniversary, with cool DVD extra's. Get busy & find him, so you can film segments & comments for the DVD. Hopefully we'll hear from him, Sarah Jessica Parker, & Paul ""Pee Wee"" Reubens, as well as other cast members.",Flight of the Navigator
97,beefslice,Awesome!,10,29 September 2000,One of the greatest movies of all time. Great special effects that can't be matched and thought provoking time lines for it's era. If you were a child in the 80's and watch this it will be just like the first time.,Flight of the Navigator
98,musicman86,Flight of the Navigator is a great movie,10,29 April 2006,"This is a great movie. It is classic for both parents and children. It really brings on nostalgaia. This is a clean movie. It has supereb special effects. ( especially for 1986) The writer did an excellent job. With its scfi elements and excellent characters it will delight children of all ages. Adults too. Joey Cramer who plays David, the main character really brings the story to life. The rest of the cast is equally as talented in their respective roles. The little robot at NASA and the design of the space ship are well done, and pulled off with a great degree of skill and competence. I recommend this movie for anybody who likes a fun, relaxing and all around good movie and good time.",Flight of the Navigator
99,jgardner1955,"Joey Cramer was the cutest kid, it was a great family show",10,26 January 2008,"My boys enjoyed this show, and we loved the ship and the happy ending. I was surprised he did not continue in show biz. I even saw another movie called Heartland Ghost and I was so excited because I just knew it was him but it was another actor names Gabrielle Olds that played Jeff in that show. I wish I could find a current picture or any picture of Joey Cramer after that movie. Some of his co-stars are still making great movies. I just hope he is well and happy with his life. I had three boys and they ran around the house saying Compliance. It was sooo cute. They even loved how the ships voice changed to pee wee's. After Joey was able to come back to the way things were with his little alien friend, they wondered how he was going to keep his little friend a secret from his parents. I am just glad I was able to raise my boys without having them get on the roof to shoot off fireworks. I wonder if Joey has any boys and if they have seen their fathers movies. Young people whose parents were actors have a very unique way to know what their parents were like as kids, beside the normal pictures and home movies.",Flight of the Navigator

This movie ROCKS!",Flight of the Navigator
101,Naccah,Perfect Rainy Night,10,17 February 2002,This film rocks.  If you ever just want to sit back and watch a good film... watch this 'un.  It does not require any thing of you... it does not make you want to be any thing other than yourself (like alot of movies out there right now) it's just a good movie to watch on some rainy evening with some friends.,Flight of the Navigator
102,FooSchnickens,a great childhood movie,8,25 February 2005,"fortunately for the above reviewer, it has been re-released by Disney as well as a myriad of other older movies like The cat from outer space and Return to witch mountain. I totally agree that this is a great movie FM my childhood and i look forward to sharing it with future generations. I think it's great to see studios coming out with old material once again. Disney is releasing sets right now that contain all the feature cartoons for certain characters. The only one i have sen in stores so far is Pluto, but it's great to have to sit down and watch with my nephew. We both get great enjoyment out of it, and your kids will too.",Flight of the Navigator
103,kompko,My favorite film ever,10,12 January 2017,"It is without doubt my favorite movie. In the 80s in the heat of the US space race and Russia, this movie made us dream of the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life, of breaking the air laws of flight and of giving a teenager the possibility of living a fascinating adventure .When I finish this movie for the first time I was dreaming for several days that I had the possibility to live an experience like this. This film awakened in me an impressive interest in everything related to space and all its mysteries.Today I still dream of piloting a spaceship from the hand of an alien.Absolutely recommended.",Flight of the Navigator
104,e_imdb-48,Fantastic!,10,20 September 2004,"This film is to blame for my over active imagination. Saw it on TV when i was at school and watched it over and over ever since! Though the quality of the film was not something i would have noticed when i was that age, i did notice the amazing special effects (for that era of cinematographic effects).The ship design (Steve Austin) is truly inspired (especially when in 'first class manouvre' mode!!) and stylistically has stood the test of time (it could quite easily pass off as futuristic in new films today. Maybe he should have done some more design work(?).And my favourite character ... 'Al', the big guy at the service station ('Rusty' Pouch), best bit of acting ever!The flight scenes and the concept of flying in a cool spaceship caught my young mind most of all. As i watched it time and time again, the many other factors proved to play a major part of the film. The music score for one is great and for me has become a critical part of the film (I love the 80's synth!)All in all, this piece of cinema was very very well thought out, constructed, produced, acted, all fitting together in a film that many films could never achieve.Go buy it on DVD!E:)",Flight of the Navigator

106,glass-spider90,A great family film that doesn't talk down to kids!,9,7 January 2014,"When I was a kid I always loved this film. I'm 23 now and I still love it, especially as I am a fan of science fiction. If you are a fan of science fiction you will love this film. The film is about a 12 year old boy called David who, one night while looking for his younger brother in a wood, slips and loses consciousness. When he wakes up he thinks only a few hours have passed but its eight years later and his family had left him for dead. David hasn't changed but everyone and everything else has. David and his family try to uncover the truth, but little do they know that doing so will take David on a great adventure. This film has everything, it is well written, has good dialogue, has humour and what's more the acting is good. It is very subtle and sophisticated for a family/kids film and doesn't talk down to its younger viewers. This makes it easily accessible for adult viewing. Even though this film is nearly 30 years old, it has stood the test of time and is definitely a much watch.",Flight of the Navigator
107,hey_mr_bill,My Absolute Favorite,10,2 March 2005,"I was six when ""Flight of the Navigator"" came out, and I absolutely loved it! I remember when it came on TV on Sunday night as a part of the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" (aired a new family movie every Sunday night on either CBS or ABC). I taped the movie and over the last 18 years I've nearly destroyed the tape from watching it so much! One of my favorite scenes is when David figures out how to fly the spacecraft. Watching the craft transform from Stage 1 to Stage 3 created so many dreams and fantasies for me as a child. Regarding the 80's in general, I love the special effects. True acting died with the invention of super-computer generated effects and only in the movies made in the 80's were the actors capable of portraying the story line purely through true acting. I'm so glad it has come out on DVD; it will remain one of my favorite movies (among a list of other 80's movies) for all time!",Flight of the Navigator
108,bunnygirl_blue,"""Sit Down, NAVIGATOR"" .....and watch this great movie!!!!",9,14 June 2005,"I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!! I have loved it since i was a kid. Considering this movie is from 1986, it is still one of the best movies that is great for the entire family. I think everyone should try and see Flight of the Navigator. It is pretty hard to find, but definitely worth the effort!!!! The story is great and is perfect for everyone regardless of age. Here's the basic story plot: David's mother sends him to meet his younger brother who is walking home from a friend's house. David decides to cut through the forest. Something scares him and he falls and hits his head. He wakes up after what feels like only minutes, but turns out to have been 7 years. Nasa finds out about this and starts questioning him. David then stumbles across this amazing spaceship....and that's when his adventure begins!!! Even though this movie is from the 80's, some of the effects are still amazing (like the spaceship - both inside and out, the views from the ship, the creatures aboard the ship....etc). I think anyone who watches this movie will fall in love with it!!!!",Flight of the Navigator

I have searched my brain for the name of it for years, even as I remembered full scenes, extremely detailed. I just couldn't remember the name of the film. I started renting anything I recognized from when I was young - and ended up watching some great films (although most were slower than I remembered them to be). But, finally, I found this, my favourite film, and I have to say it is just as exciting and cool and exciting as I remembered (keep in mind, even as a young person, I had a keen eye for excellence in film :) ).

113,calicat5,One of the most remembered movies of all time!,10,20 October 2005,"I don't know if anyone read this or not before i edited it but this is the revised version. I gave it a 10 and the reason why is 'cause i just met Joey Cramer. I always loved Flight of the Navigator but i never knew the actors name who played the main character, i saw the movie when it opened 2x and then again on T.V a few times and even had a crush on him but never paid attention to what his name was, i just knew i loved the movie and the actor. Growing up i would ask myself ""I wonder what happened to that kid from Flight of the Navigator"". Well now i know, I was introduced to him as Joe by my Fiancé and didn't think anything i saw him as just another guy that was really down to earth, sweet and kinda shy although he looked really familiar.A few days later visiting my Fiancé, his friend asked me if i had ever seen Flight of the Navigator, i asked why and he told me that the guy Joe that i had met was the kid from the movie and right away i went up to Joe who was in the next room and asked him and it was true not only 'cause he said so but comparing facts and pics. on the internet i know it's true. He looks basically the same, i remembered him being chubby so i thought he had lost weight but i just bought the movie and watched it again and he's pretty skinny there, hes now got some muscle though. I was so excited about finding out it was him but he doesn't like to talk about his life back then, he wants his privacy. After he did Flight of the Navigator he had a hard life and is now trying to make it better so that's all i'm gonna say about him.In regards to the movie i loved it when i was a child and still do although i remembered it differently and it seemed a lot shorter now too. It's perfect for the whole family and it's not boring. I don't think it was digitally remastered though but the effects are still good. I gave this movie a 10 on the basis that i know Joe but even if i hadn't met him i still give it a 10 because it really was good, to me it's one of the classics for kids in the 80's.",Flight of the Navigator

Hopefully I am speaking for other when I say I hope to see a sequel to the movie soon. It has now been 20 years since the movie was made, and it is time for the continuation. Others will agree that the ending left plenty of room for a Flight of the Navigator 2. Using the same characters if possible, the main character, David, will be 40 years old. Randal Kleiser has made some great movies in his time, and I believe he is one of the greatest directors of all time. He has directed some pretty knarly movies, such as Grease, The Blue Lagoon, Boy in the Plastic Bubble, and White Fang. There are other that are well known but too many to list. Flight of the Navigator needs a Sequel, that is all I am saying.",Flight of the Navigator
