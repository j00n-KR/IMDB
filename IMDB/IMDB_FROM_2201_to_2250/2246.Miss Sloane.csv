0,SnoopyStyle,tries too hard,4,15 May 2017,Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a hard-driving free-market Washington lobbyist. She is meticulous without a personal life. Robert Forde (Jake Lacy) is her newest male escort. Her latest fight is to stop a tax against Indonesian palm oil. She is approached to work on a pro-gun campaign but she laughs in Bob Sanford's face. She quits her job and joins the much smaller gun control side headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong). Esme Manucharian is a young associate who faced death during an earlier gun incident. Elizabeth's former boss George Dupont (Sam Waterston) and former assistant Jane Molloy (Alison Pill) drive to destroy her after getting hired by the pro-gun side. Dupont pressures Senator Sperling (John Lithgow) to chair a committee to prosecute Elizabeth.Chastain is trying too hard. Her character tries too hard. The story tries too hard. The politics try too hard. It starts with her laughing at Sanford. It's so fake and yet she doesn't sell it as fake. It's over the top in a bad way. The politics also feels wrong. The premise is that the rich NRA has bought the congress against their own self-interest. It's politics as envisioned by one side. There are situations popping up through the movie that are too manufactured. I keep thinking some of them are setups. The movie is simply trying too hard.,Miss Sloane
1,Horst_In_Translation,Not half as smart as it wants to be,4,26 July 2017,"""Miss Sloane"" is a French/American English-language movie from 2016 that managed a solid deal of awards attention, including a Golden Globe nomination for lead actress Jessica Chastain. Other known actors in here are probably Waterston, Pill, Lithgow, Baranski, Stuhlbarg and Strong, but eventually the only one it is about is Chastain's character. It is a really long movie at comfortably more than 2 hours and the focus here is on lobbyism in the United States. We follow the battle between two groups and it is all about gun restrictions here. I am not American, so I guess I can give a fairly neutral observation here and honestly I was shocked by how simple and uninspired this film turned out to be. I am sure it is a feast for everybody who supports more gun restrictions, so most liberals/democrats will have a great time watching it. But it is so black-and-white really. The characters with the exception of Chastain's have absolutely no depth at all. We find out about pretty much nobody from the liberal camp except Raw's character, so the focus won't shift away from Chastain. And of course she knows everything, she predicts everything correctly, she is the shining figure for one party etc. It is fairly cringeworthy.On the other side, the opponents, the villains, they are depicted as stubborn old men, stupid, antiquated in their beliefs and really incapable of anything creative. The exception is of course Stuhlbarg's character with his age and they say on some occasions that he is pretty effective in what he does, but when we saw his weak performance at the television debate (nice cameo by Dylan Baker though), it was clear that nobody from the writing staff wanted to make this an equal fight really. Oh yeah and then there is the ending. All predicted by Miss Sloane again too. What the other side would do, what story they would find, how corrupt they would be etc. It is pretty cringeworthy. The big showdown at the court room when she waits a bit until she says she still has something to say before she goes all in on Lithgow's character and of course she is the big winner again, even if she has to go to jail in exchange for her victory. But yeah, they show her leave jail in the very last scene, so they really wanted to make sure we get a happy ending somehow with her in freedom and the old filth in jail. Sigh.This film may seem deep or relevant, but that's really only how the untrained eye perceives it. Neutral observers will be embarrassed by the simple structures, the ridiculous plot lines, the over-the-top unauthentic drama moments (the almost shooting of the Black woman) and then the truly cringeworthy ending. As if the ""spectacular"" revelation about Pill's character wasn't bad enough already, everything that happens afterward is really just the icing on the cake. It is a very rotten cake I would say. The overall outcome of this film was surprisingly bad to me. Only the easily entertained will see this as a good politics thriller. Oscar nominee John Madden (the director of Best Picture winner ""Shakespeare in Love"") did not get me curious here at all about the rest of his body of work and I don't think I have seen a lot from him, if anything at all. But then again he probably isn't even the problem. The huge problem here may be writer Jonathan Perera and it very much shows during these 130 minutes that this is his very first writing credit. I wish they could have gotten somebody better here, then this movie really could have made a difference in my opinion. The cast includes some really talented guys and actors I like quite a lot. But it turned out a missed opportunity as this is so bad at time that I would almost call it liberal propaganda. Closer to one star out of five than to three stars out of five. Highly not recommended.",Miss Sloane
2,Prismark10,Point and shoot,6,18 March 2017,"Miss Sloane is a long film about government lobbying whose second half is better than its first half.Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) upsets her bosses when she turns down the gun lobby and jumps ship to a rival firm who is supporting a bill to expand background checks for gun purchases.Her actions causes a split between her team, some of whom go with her to the new firm and those who decide to stay behind. Sloane is driven and smart. She anticipates what might be thrown at her as her group attempts to get senate support for the bill.The film has a dual narrative as it starts with a senate investigation looking to misconduct in her part which we return to as the film progresses.Jessica Chastain gives a strong performance as Miss Sloane, tough as nails and someone who is prepared to trample on her colleagues. She will do whatever it takes as a lobbyist to succeed.The film has a long running time and it starts off rather sludgedly like it is another film about political lobbyists and the games they play but it gets more fascinating as it goes on.",Miss Sloane
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Thrillers Recently Released,8,28 March 2021,"In Washington D.

While facing the Powers That Be, she has to prove her competency paying a high-cost.""Miss Sloane"" is one of the best thrillers recently released by the Cinema Industry. The powerful story and screenplay has complex dialogs and the magnificent Jessica Chastain in the lead role. This is the type of film that deserves to be watched more than once.

4,nogodnomasters,I guess I'm just a piece of work,10,5 August 2017,"Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a power broker lobbyist who is skilled at lies and deceit. She is hard working, dedicated and gets the job done. Her methods are twisty and are what makes the film as we watch Sloane step on people, hurt them , use them, and even herself to achieve her goal, in this case to get a gun check bill passed in the Senate.Apparently there is an assumption such a bill would pass the House of Representatives, which has been doubtful for quite a number of years. The film climaxes in a court room drama of a Senate hearing, which we see in the opening.Guide: F-word, sex. No nudity.",Miss Sloane
5,lee_eisenberg,unabashed cynicism,8,29 May 2017,"John Madden's ""Miss Sloane"" is, quite simply, an exercise in cynicism. The title lobbyist's battle against the gun industry is but a look into the cutthroat world that is US politics. It's a place where nothing gets done without favors (Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" looked at this to a lesser extent).As for the movie itself, it's well done. Jessica Chastain puts on a chilling performance as the main character. Despite her delicate feminine appearance, she's the type who'll stop at nothing to achieve her goals. I liked the performances of most the cast, but I thought that Christine Baranski (best known as Leonard's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"") had an all too brief appearance. Otherwise it's a good movie.",Miss Sloane
6,jboothmillard,Miss Sloane,5,19 September 2021,"I knew this film was something to do with law, and I must have remembered that it had a red-headed lead actress, but besides that I knew nothing else, so I watched it hoping for something good, directed by John Madden (Mrs. Brown, Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). Basically, Madeline ""Elizabeth"" Sloane (Golden Globe nominated Jessica Chastain) is a ruthless lobbyist (activist) who has been called to appear at a congressional hearing led by Senator Ronald Sperling (John Lithgow) to answer questions about possible violations of Senate ethics rules during her tenure at Washington D. C. lobbying firm Cole Kravitz & Waterman. Over three months earlier, Sloane's firm is approached by gun manufacturing representative Bill Sandford (Chuck Shamata) to lead the opposition to the proposed Heaton-Harris bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Sloane ridicules Sanford's idea to target female voters. She is later approached by Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt (Mark Strong), the head of rival lobbying firm Peterson Wyatt, to lead the effort in support of the bill instead. Sloane agrees and takes most of her staff along with her, though her closest associate Jane Molloy (Alison Pill) refuses to leave. At Peterson Wyatt, Sloane selects Esme Manucharian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) to conduct most the firm's media appearances, and they make significant progress in garnering votes for the bill. Even though Esme does not want to disclose it, Sloane reveals that Esme's secret, that she survived a school shooting, during a live television debate. Later, Esme is held up at gunpoint while leaving her office, but her attacker is shot dead by another civilian who is legally carrying a gun. Gun rights supporters capitalise on this event, which causes the Heaton-Harris bill to lose support in the Senate. The news of the Senate inquiry into Sloane's lobbying practices also adds to complications. In-between Sloane's legal and professional matters, it is revealed that she takes various drugs to help her stay awake. It is also revealed that, having no time for a relationship, she pays for sex with male escorts, and despite wanting to meet her preferred regular escort, she is forced to settle with Forde (Jake Lacy), but she finds herself able to open up to him about her troubles. Returning to the congressional hearing, Senator Sperling produces a form requesting approval of overseas travel for a Senator. It was filed by a non-profit organisation but completed in Sloane's handwriting, indicating she violated Senate ethics rules with her involvement, as a lobbyist, in arranging the travel. Sloane repeatedly answers most questions with ""Upon the advice of counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer your question, based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution."" But she swears under oath that she has never practiced illegal wiretapping. In her final statement at the hearing, Sloane admits she anticipated the opposition might attack her personally if Peterson Wyatt made too much progress with the Heaton-Harris bill. But it is revealed that she did have someone secretly working for her, and she did use wiretapping to record Senator Sperling accepting bribes from Cole Kravitz & Waterman boss George Dupont (Sam Waterston). Ten months later, Sloane is in prison and visited by her lawyer, who tells her that the Heaton-Harris bill passed. It ends with Sloane released from prison, but her career in tatters. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Pat Connors, Dylan Baker as Jon O'Neill, Christine Baranski as Evelyn Sumner, and Douglas Smith as Alex. Chastain absolutely annihilates any of the supporting performances being the ferociously sharp workaholic, even talents like Stuhlbarg and Mbatha-Raw are quashed, despite giving good performances. The ""for"" and ""against"" argument for gun control in America is a strong subject for a film, bits of did get my attention, I'm not going to pretend I understood absolutely everything going on, but it is not all boring, Chastain is the biggest reason to watch it, a reasonable political thriller. Worth watching!",Miss Sloane
7,blanche-2,wonderful Chastain performance,10,6 October 2018,"Jessica Chastain is ""Miss Sloane,"" a 2016 film directed by John Madden and also starring Sam Waterston, Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alison Pill, Jake Lacy, and John Lithgow.Elizabeth Sloane is an aggressive lobbyist who lets nothing stand in her way when she wants to achieve a goal. The film begins with her being called to give testimony at a congressional hearing that accuses her of violations of Senate ethics.In flashback, we see that the firm she works for is approached to lead the opposition to a gun bill expanding background checks. Sloane instead goes to work for Rodolfo Schmidt (Strong), with another lobbying firm, to get the bill passed.What a brilliant film, so relevant to today, particularly Chastain's monologue at the end of the film. All the performances are excellent, but she is amazing as an outspoken and tough woman whose work is everything to her.The film has an interesting twist at the end.I never considered Chastain a beauty - I never thought she photographed very well - but she indeed is very beautiful, and her formidable talent matches her looks.Truly a must-see. And so true to life!",Miss Sloane
8,Quinoa1984,#nastywomen,8,20 December 2016,"This is overall good work, a talky but fierce and intelligent script, featuring one of those performances that people hopefully will continue to go back to from Jessica Chastain that makes it clearer why she shows so much depth and dimension for a character that could, in other hands or on the page by itself, not seem to be as... human (the very opening, which you've seen in the trailer, shows her as so cold it may be, uh, ""scary"" to those men uncomfortable with women simply being strong *people*, regardless of gender, or, maybe, because of it too).It's a very good movie, the kind that Hollywood used to make more of (or just saw a wider release than 1,600 screens at a s***y time of release at the end of an Election year), though just shy of greatness. If it had had a Fincher or an Alan J Pakula behind it or something with a little stronger of a vision - Madden is good, but standard, a hired gun who executes it as well as he knows how, and casts it impeccably, but shoots it like it's (often, not always) a TV show, and I thought less of House of Cards and more of Scandal, albeit this is much smarter than Scandal gets - then it might be unstoppable.The only part of the ending I found unrealistic really is that a gun bill for universal background checks and stricter regulations could pass in this country, regardless of what comes out about the sneaky meetings between lobbyists and politicians - for practically ANY reason. It's a nice ending, but a little but of a fantasy in the world we're living in, where race and culture and so many other factors make gun control such a burnt hot potato, if that makes sense. But considering that's 5% of this movie, it's great to see the other 95% showing the political world as cutthroat as it is, which is how it f****g is.Or as Sloane puts it, and I'm paraphrasing here, being cynical is something Polyannish people say when they don't want to sound naive. I'd add what George Carlin says about them: the real cynics think that everything is going to be alright.",Miss Sloane
9,CinemaSerf,"Do as I say, not as I do...",7,25 September 2021,"Jessica Chastain is formidable in the role of the eponymous lobbyist working to get a gun control bill through the US Congress. As you'd expect from a such an highly politically charged issue, she has to sail pretty close to the legal wind to get persuade, cajole and sometimes even threaten her democratically elected targets to get the votes - and she faces some very tough, and ruthless competition. The film depicts well, if somewhat worryingly, the levels of partisan corruption on ""the Hill"", and of just how dog-eat-dog a community it is. The screenplay offers us a glimpse into the sacrifices her character must make - both with her reputation and her personal life; and being a woman, the appalling double standards applied by her foes surrounding some of her choices are writ large. It's let down a bit, i felt, by an ending that though well delivered by the star, only served to heighten my concerns about the whole surveillance culture that exists nowadays, but in this case - it was all just a bit too absurdly pre-meditated and neat! Still, this is as good a political drama as I've seen for a long while. It is gritty and entertaining, and showcases the skill of the star, and of the bloodthirsty nature of her vocation compellingly.",Miss Sloane
10,writers_reign,(Fast) Draw Poker,8,17 May 2017,"As a student of irony I relish the way that the pro-gun lobby have reacted to a film they THINK may be anti without bothering to 1) actually watch it or 2) research it. This has, of course, resulted in the film being classed as a flop in the United States when, in countries with a more rational population its merits are fully recognised and appreciated. My abiding memory of Jessica Chastain is of a well-meaning but seriously naïve dork in another fine film, The Help, and now here she is revelling in a role that couldn't be more diametrically opposed and not only that but acting the bejesus out of it. Chastain is only one of a group of stellar performances in one of the best films of 2017.",Miss Sloane
11,oscaralbert,MISS SLOANE is by far the most important flick of This Election Year . . .,8,12 December 2016,". . . as Jessica Chastain's title character ""weaponizes herself"" (in the words of her lawyer) to drain part of the Rich People Party Swamp in Washington, DC. ""Our system is rotten . . . it makes rats who sell out America to keep their noses in the Public Trough"" MISS SLOANE says as she introduces some Candid Cockroach Camera footage in Senate Caucus Room Number Four. In True I-Am-Spartacus Tradition, MISS SLOANE sacrifices herself for America's good. When you see this the same day that SOME Rich People Party Senators are saying on TV that Russia's hacking of our 2016 Election is an ACT OF WAR, and that White House Resident-Elect Rump is LYING when he says he did not explicitly condone, encourage, aid, and abet this Traitorous War Crime against America in front of 100 million TV witnesses, this is tantamount to them saying that Rump will be arrested, tried, and executed for High Treason as soon as he's sworn in. The coming Civil War will make America's battle to end Racist Lazy Southern Black Slavery in the 1860s look like a tiny kerfuffle in comparison, as by MISS SLOANE's standards, we will all need to ""weaponize ourselves"" to fight against the 60 million Traitors among us.",Miss Sloane
12,neil-476,I used my brain!,8,9 May 2018,"Liz Sloane does not relate well to people: she has little empathy for others. She does, however, understand what makes people tick, which is why she is an excellent lobbyist. She is working for a firm which is seeking to generate senatorial support for a bill to require greater background checks for those buying firearms: the gun lobby is fiercely opposed to this. All this is presented within a framing story by which we know that there is a senate hearing into Sloane's alleged rule breaking during her lobbying activities.Let me say at the start that this film engages the interest at the start and holds it throughout. It is a great pleasure to find one's brain in use all the way through over two hours of a movie: the story is fresh and always moving, with much drama along the way. Never difficult to follow, it has a couple of dramatic high points along the way, and a great ending - fair, but unexpected. I really liked the story here.While I like Jessica Chastain on chat shows, I always find her performances a little cold. That very coldness suits Liz Sloane, however, and Chastain really impresses here. The rest of the cast are good too, providing some of the emotional connection which Liz Sloane can't (or doesn't) offer. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is as impressive as she was in Belle.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but I did, a lot.",Miss Sloane
13,ferguson-6,at any cost,7,8 December 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Timing can be crucial for a film attempting to capitalize on a hot social or political topic or event. One gets the feeling that the filmmakers were excited to open this film on the heels of a Hillary Clinton victory  a story about a powerful woman, laser-focused on her mission to push through gun-control legislation. With an unexpected election outcome, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) and first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera may just luck out since their film can alternatively be interpreted as a scathing commentary on a corrupt existing system  the single biggest reason for that surprise election result.By now we have become accustomed to stellar performances from two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty). Here she plays super-lobbyist Elizabeth Sloane – always impeccably dressed while spouting the voluminous dialogue and quick quips that make up this workaholic, dedicated-only-to-winning viper who rules the snake pit known as politics. When her big firm boss (Sam Waterston) tries to strong arm her into working with the NRA to quash the proposed gun-control legislation  encouraging her to 'get women excited about guns'  she quickly takes her competitive nature (and most of her staff) to the opposition, resulting in escalated political warfare.Much of this plays like an Aaron Sorkin spin-off, but it's surprising how few movies have focused on the fascinating world of lobbyists. Thank You for Smoking (2005) and Casino Jack (2010) are probably the most widely seen, but it's Michael Clayton (2007) that seems to have the most in common tonally with this look at ethics (or lack thereof), conniving strategy, and backroom maneuverings.Ms. Chastain owns the film and the role, and there is strong supporting work from Mark Strong (as her new boss), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (making the most of a few scenes), John Lithgow (as the Senator running the Congressional hearing), Michael Stuhlbarg (as a worthy adversary), Jake Lacy (as Sloane's only diversion), Alison Pill (her assistant), Dylan Baker (a talk show host), and David Wilson Barnes (her attorney). It's an impressive group that adds substance to the project.Do the ends justify the means? Is anyone as ambitious and adept at political games as Elizabeth Sloane? Are ethics really this compromised in the world that creates our laws and policies? However you choose to answer those questions, a look at the misplaced priorities of our elected officials  and the influence of powerful lobbyists  are absolutely worthy of our attention, and undoubtedly contributed to the biggest election surprise in recent memory.",Miss Sloane
14,phd_travel,A brave movie and a heroine for the ages,8,16 May 2017,This movie about a tough as nails female lobbyist fighting against the process to introduce some background checks for firearms purchases. Jessica Chastain is perfect for this role - elegant smart and believable. She never loses your sympathy because her cause is so right. The direction is a little bit rushed - it's hard to follow some of the dialog. The story is hopeful that with a great sacrifice some common sense can finally prevail in this absurd gun situation that we face now. Why wouldn't any one except those who make money from selling guns or those who shouldn't have guns be against proper checks? Some industries shouldn't be in the private sector and driven by profit.,Miss Sloane
15,gradyharp,'Lobbying is about foresight. About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising counter measures.',10,26 March 2017,"This intensely well written (Jonathan Perera making his script writing debut), well directed (John Madden) and well cast film comes at a time when everyone is languishing at the obvious corruption and implosion of the political mess in Washington, DC. Perhaps if more people had seen the film before elections the result of that fiasco may have been avoided. This is an insider view of how our government works – and it is appalling. That response could only be elicited if the forces behind this highly controversial film were of the highest quality – and that is precisely what occurs in this lengthy, disturbing, revealing, and wise film about not only the concept of lobbying (read – buying votes rather than earning them) but also about the agony so widespread in every sector of Washington DC.This film is titled well – MISS SLOANE – because it is about the mind and actions and ferocious commitment to beliefs that one powerful and brilliant lobbyist represents. In the high-stakes world of political power brokers, Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in D.C. Known equally for her cunning and her track record of success, she has always done whatever is required to win. But when she takes on the most powerful opponent of her career, she finds that winning may come at too high a price. The subject is the gun law – requiring registration of all buyers of weapons in an attempt to prevent guns falling into the hands of dangerous people. It is fought as a '2nd amendment right' by the NRA and the pro-gun big bucks lobbyists and bought out senators and congressmen. Liz leaves one lobbying company (leaving behind Allison Pill and Sam Waterston) and joins with Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong) and Esme Manuchurian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and others and eventually must face a Senate investigation lead by the corrupt Senator Sperling (John Lithgow). Along the way the driven Liz uses meds and escorts (Jake Lacy) and her incredible astute mind to bring down the gun lobbyists, but at a price. Jessica Chastain shines in this role and her supporting cast is exceptionally strong. Max Richter's musical score adds tension at the right moments and the cinematography by Sebastian Blenkov keeps pace with this fast moving story. But in the end much credit must be given to the script written astonishingly fine debut writer Jonathan Perera. He is already in a league with Tom Forde and Aaron Sorkin – and that is very high praise. Highly recommended.",Miss Sloane
16,deloudelouvain,A bit too much talking and arguing for me.,6,9 December 2018,"Maybe I'm a bit harsh with my ratings for this one, but let just say that the story isn't the kind of story that I have alot of interest for in real life. Or at least I don't think much good of it. The lobbying industry is perfectly portrayed in Miss Sloane. It's exactly what I think about those kind of people, arrogant and self-centered, people that will walk over bodies to get what they want. The biggest part of the movie I was just listening to their constant arguing, and I have to admit that that is not my favorite thing to do when watching a movie, certainly not if it goes back and forth very quickly, about things I don't care. The acting is good though. Jessica Chastain as Madeline Elizabeth Sloane, plays her role of unpleasant coldhearted b*tch as the best. You won't get any sympathy for her. In fact not many characters are pleasant, as they are all lobbyists or politicians, and those are people I don't have a high opinion of. But the end of the movie was unexpected and made up a little for me. I thought it was a very good ending for once.",Miss Sloane
17,siderite,"The Newsroom for the big screen, with politics",7,20 August 2017,"The story of the movie is simple enough and even the ending is pretty clear from the get go if you try a bit. However the subject of the movie makes this worth a watch, as it takes a hard look at what it means to win, even for a right cause, in the murky world of politics. Is it right to use dirty methods to do a good thing? Is Miss Sloane the hero or the villain? Will the cast ever stop speaking like a machine gun to give out the impression that everybody is smart and competent?The problem with the film was the writing, mostly. It wasn't bad, just sloppy. It made it difficult to focus on the moral of the story while it was gearing towards an obvious reveal. And so many good actors were completely underused: Mark Strong, John Lithgow, Alison Pill, even Jake Lacy and Sam Waterston. They could have done so much better.Bottom line, an average movie with an interesting concept that is spoiled by the mediocre writing.",Miss Sloane

This film ""Miss Sloane"" is much about just that and it's a character showcase of one strong ,elegant, and sexy female lead character in that of one political power lobby woman named Elizabeth Sloane(in one of Jessica Chastain's most powerful performances).This lady Miss Sloane isn't without her flaws though as she will do anything to win and take what it does to get the job done by playing political games. Also Elizabeth's vices include a little bed game of hot passion on the side with a male escort!(Oh that scene of Jessica stripping down and showing a little bit of a black strapless bra was so hot!). So it's typical Washington ways that involves scandal and sex along with under the table deals and bribes.Still aside from the hot and style like subplots this film is a journey of fighting for truth and seeking an honest way and meaning against the powerful and dirty system in D.C.. That's what Elizabeth Sloane fought for was for the rights of others who had been hurt by guns taking on the establishment and working for those who had been affected by gun violence. Overall nothing great, still it's a moving film that expresses freedom and standing up for truth all while fighting the system with help from a woman in one Miss Sloane who had style, grace, and wit and wisdom.",Miss Sloane

A Poruguese writer living in Asia, this script was discovered and financed by Director John Madden (Shakespeare In Love). It works out to be a pretty good marriage of a writer and director who knows how to put this on film.The plot involves one of the hardest kick ass women this side of Wonder Woman. Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a high power lobbyist who is testifying in front of a US Senate Investigation Committee headed by Senator Ronald M. Sperling (John Lithgow), whose trying to nail her for some very shady lobbying business. She gets up from a conference meeting and resigns at her employer and takes most of her office with her to another firm to fight a literal war with the US Senate to try and pass a gun control bill.The cast includes Mark Strong (both Kingsmen films), Sam Waterston, and plenty of other players with a hard driving Sloane and a team really goes after Senators. Michael Stuhlbarg (Men In Black 2) is effective in support as Pat Conners.

20,lasttimeisaw,a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity,7,16 July 2017,"Directed by John Madden, who has an estimable political-correct streak of making movies with remarkable female roles in the lead, from MRS. BROWN (1997), Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998) to THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL franchise, MISS SLOANE is no exception. The fearless Jessica Chastain stars as our titular American lobbyist, in the opening shot, she directly addresses to us a lobbyist's golden rule with a dead-center fourth-wall-breaking close-up: always to outmaneuver your opponent, and keeping your trump card to have the last laugh, which is exactly what happens in this sleekly choreographed political drama recounts Miss Elizabeth Sloane and her co.'s upward battle of advocating a gun-control bill against her nefarious adversaries. The film starts in medias res, Elizabeth is under questioning at a congressional hearing led by Senator Ronald Sperling (Lithgow), to investigate her possible infringement while she was working in her former company, which currently is fully behind the obstruction of the said bill. Carried with a vibrant but intensely hectic tempo, the plot is dialogue-driven and we are granted a coup d'il of this cut-throat line-of-work of lobbyist, and Elizabeth is the crème-de-la-crème of the crop, but to what cost? She is a prototypical workaholic, a chronic insomniac and inveterately dependent on medication, everyday she dines at the same Chinese restaurant just because it never closes, it goes without saying that she is single and only resorts to escort service to physically de- pressurize herself on a regular basis. Actually the film reveals nothing about her background, her family or her past, virtually she is a working robot, but a hyper-smart one. But that is not to say her working method is not unethical, she is a proficient anticipator, who can plan her moves much in advance, and boy, she takes no prisoners with her. A key pawn is her colleague Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw), who is a survivor of a gun massacre when she was a high-schooler and is still in shell-shock, such a great resource at hand, Elizabeth will not leave that untapped, only its imperilment blindsides her and compels she to rethink her strategy. Jumping back and forth in its time-line, throwing shades at the goings-on plotting to sabotage the beneficial bill (with a self-defeating twist of life being saved from the gun point by a self-armed vigilante, yet why no one pays attention to the gun procured by the delirious killer-to-be? That is the crux in question!), MISS SLOANE prepares us with a consequential trump card which will leave audience both stunned and suspicious, for one thing, it might justify Elizabeth's actions with her over-contrived martyrization, but when one thinks back, it is just not practical because the ""earthquake"" doesn't necessarily need to be timed in that particular moment, Elizabeth can use it more wisely and realistically, to save all the drama and playing dumb all along the line, but as an info-taiment, Madden will not risk to downplay that arousing topsy-turvy uproar. Sensibly, it angles more at the pandemic rotten corruption than its token target of gun control, since after all, it is also monetary interest playing the crucial role in its execution. (the point is never about freedom or right, gun is such a highly profitable business for the country, it boils down to a choice between economy and individual life, and at our own peril, the latter can be regretfully relinquished.) For all its foibles: over-contrivance, one-noted characterization of its antagonists and most supporting roles, there is no denying that Ms. Chastain is all fired up in a tailor-made role and she is absolutely barnstorming and uncompromising in bringing to the fore of a severely flawed human being with flesh and blood, beautifully transfigures the sensation-seeking narrative arc and winds up a full-fledged anatomy of a complex character study with hard-earned credit, this is truly a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity out of her own dedication and faculty, she is such a godsend to the film industry, the fact that she is still waiting for her first naked golden statue is simply beyond belief.",Miss Sloane
21,Hellmant,"Should be seen as quality entertainment to everyone, no matter where you stand on the political topic.",9,16 December 2016,"'MISS SLOANE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A political thriller starring Jessica Chastain, as an obsessively dedicated lobbyist who dares to take on the gun-lobby. The film was directed by seasoned filmmaker John Madden (who also directed Chastain in the 2010 thriller 'THE DEBT'), and it was written by first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera. It costars Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha- Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alison Pill, Sam Waterston, John Lithgow and Jake Lacy. The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and Chastain has received a Best Actress Golden Globe nomination (Drama) for her performance. I was really moved by the film!Elizabeth Sloane (Chastain) is one of the most successful, and disturbingly obsessive, lobbyists in Washington, D.C.. Her tactics are known for being questionably immoral, and sometimes illegal, as she'll do almost anything to win. Sloane catches everyone by surprise, when she decides to challenge the even more corrupt gun- lobby. Her extreme dedication to winning might finally become too much for her, as well as everyone around her, in her new daring conquest.The film is politically insightful, especially in modern times, and quite dramatically involving too. Chastain gives a very powerful performance (possibly one of the best of her career), and her character is pretty fascinating as well. The movie should be seen as quality entertainment to everyone, no matter where you stand on the political topic. In my humble opinion, it's an impressively well made film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJwjSDWrIEM",Miss Sloane
22,MOscarbradley,A nice smart movie about an unpopular subject.,7,1 March 2019,"More dirty politics and particularly prescient in the time of Trump. Elizabeth Sloane is a lobbyist whose failure to get into bed with the NRA seems to be her undoing, especially when she decides to change sides. It may or may not prove to be a smart move but this is a smart movie with a cracker of a script from Jonathan Perera, a typically high-powered performance from the always reliable Jessica Chastain and a terrific supporting cast that includes Mark Strong, John Lithgow, Michael Stuhlbarg, Sam Waterson, Alison Pill and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.It looks good and it sounds good but it's not likely to please the multiplex crowd; no matter how you dress it up, politics just aren't sexy and any plot concerning gun-control means you have to take your brain into the cinema with you, something most people aren't prepared to do these days so while Miss Sloane may be good at her job, and by all accounts no slouch in bed either, she will be fighting a losing battle at the box-office.",Miss Sloane
23,ThomasDrufke,Foresight,8,10 December 2016,"I'm starting to like this actor-director team of Jessica Chastain and John Madden. The Debt, released a few years ago, is a solid, stylish thriller. And Madden continued that trend with Miss Sloane. It's an intricately constructed and intelligent political thriller with one of the best female lead performances of the year.Sometimes I like to go into movies without knowing anything, and that's how I approached Miss Sloane. Besides maybe seeing a TV spot or two, I knew little about the details regarding this project. With that said, I have to admit that I thought this may have been based on a true story until roughly the mid-point in the movie. The sharp dialogue and realistic tone gave me the impression that this story definitely occurred at some time or another. Of course, movies have a way of enhancing plot to make it feel the most cinematic, and that's the path this film began to take towards the second half.Both approaches are fine on their own, but I think it was jarring seeing the two coincide with one another in the same film. The first hour felt like I was just eavesdropping on real-life events about real people, while the second hour felt like something out of a John Grisham novel (perhaps not ironically, a novel of his can be seen in some of the scenes). So while I don't feel that John Madden necessarily succeeded in making one cohesive film, he absolutely succeeded in making a dang entertaining thriller.In the world we live in now where celebrities can be politicians or even the President of the United States, it was nice seeing a film about people who clearly know their stuff, and are prepared at every corner to discuss these issues. Right from the opening shot, Chastain as Sloane tells us that lobbying is all about foresight and being one step ahead of your opponent. This can be applied to all occupations, but especially to the world of politics. So in relating to real-world events, the character Elizabeth Sloane was a refreshing face to see. Of course, she doesn't always play by the rules or law for that matter, but the film never glorifies this lifestyle, like some news outlets do these days. If the film was about true events, I don't know that these people would get what they deserve in the end, but because it's the movies, these characters most certainly do.Sometimes the fast paced dialogue heavy scenes are too much to handle, especially for a guy like me not always privy to this side of the world, but the gripping performances and an unpredictable plot prove to be more than enough to satisfy causal moviegoers. Miss Sloane is a win for me.+Chastain & Madden are a good team+Feels realistic, but the entertainment trumps all+Gripping thriller-First & second half feel like two separate movies8.1/10",Miss Sloane
24,secondtake,A fun fast ride through contemporary political lobbying,7,18 August 2017,"Miss Sloane (2016)A hyped up political ""thriller"" that showcases Jessica Chastain as a lobbiest who is always one step ahead of her peers. And enemies. It becomes a game of wits and tricks, with the viewer led astray by normal gullibility. It's fun, and it clicks along with increasing drama. Chastain at first might seem a little miscast— not quite hard headed enough to be so cunning and heartless—but it settles in eventually. Her invimcibility (at first) is not credible, I suppose, but this is a fictional wild ride through what is probably a shabby world of bribes and begging between lobbyists and politicians. The underlying points about gun control are feel-good for gun control types, but a bit thin in their development.We never really learn what drives this woman, though a couple of hints suggest a nasty past. It's probably okay that it avoid sentiment on that score, but it makes all her machinations plot driven instead of motivated from within. Director John Madden has a resume of t.v. productions and a few movies that have an obvious hook to them (""Marigold Hotel"") and you get the sense that this is designed to be clever and entertaining above all. No depths here, in psychology, in political critique, or in movie-making.Which is fine. Well done. It does exactly what it wants to do.",Miss Sloane

It's about making sure you surprise them and they don't surprise you."" Elizabeth Sloane (Chastain) is one of the most sought after lobbyists is D.C. She is approached by the president of a gun lobby with an idea to increase the women vote. This sets off a chain of events that begins with her leaving her agency, lobbying against the gun bill he proposed and ultimately ending up under investigation by the Senate. This is a movie I was excited about because I am huge into politics and love seeing how things work. This movie really had shades of House of Cards in the way that the main character is someone that seemingly plays everyone off each other for her own benefit. The movie does seem to move slowly in a few parts, but at the same time it seems deliberate and allows the events to sink in. This is one of those movies where the ending really makes the movie and rewards you for sticking through the slower parts. Overall, a movie that shows the (I assume) real side of lobbying. Chastain is great in this and I really enjoyed this quite a bit I do recommend this but this isn't a movie for everyone. If you liked Ides of March or Our Brand Is Crisis you will most likely enjoy this one as well. I give this a B+.",Miss Sloane

But her secret life of pills and paid escorts is dragged through the bill proceedings.With a powerful performance from Chastain as the flawed heroin, Miss Sloane is an entertaining slice of US legislature that tackles the touchy subject matter of gun control from a leftist viewpoint.Moreover, the only way to sell guns to women is tell them they're only for men.

This is a superbly involving and entertaining movie about lobbyist (amazingly played by a great Jessica Chastain) who will stop at nothing to win her most challenging case yet. While i don't believe the ending as in this movie could happen in real life, it was good and entertaining. Performances were very good in this film by also Mark Strong (superb here) and John Lithgow. But the real star is Jessica Chastain who get accompanied here by superbly involving and fast moving script and very solid directing. Overall, at running time 2 hours and 5 min. ""Miss Sloane"" never dragged and was involving from start till the end because of superb script and great performances. While it doesn't go very deep into life of lobbyists nor on a subject of its central case, this is a pure, fun entertainment. Music was also very solid. All in all this is pure fun.",Miss Sloane
28,Reno-Rangan,A mastress stroke!,8,14 September 2017,"Another American politics, why should I care! If you are saying like that, then you are missing out something wonderful. First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path.It opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period. There's a voting is to take place in the parliament for the introduction of a new bill. The miss Sloane's firm splits over differences and hence two teams fight for one another in the same matter, but to achieve the opposite result. Pursuing the MPs and all other dramatic events takes place, while they are ready to go any length. Then the story comes to an end with a twist with one of them victorious, but a heavy price has to pay it.You might won't like the politics, but this is not one. This is something like the story of an election campaign team. How they work to achieve their goal, particularly keep checking their rivalry. So it was more or less a cat-mouse game kind, but the perspective was not shared equally. The majority of the film was from miss Sloane's angle. Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race. She should have won the best actress award. I might a little late to watch, but I did not miss it. So I hope you too as well not to miss it.8/10",Miss Sloane
29,Tweetienator,Zero Blank Nerdy,4,27 January 2017,"I won't go into the matter of pro- or contra-gun-control - ofc both sides will have their special point of view on Miss Sloane. I rated the flick 4 - despite of Jessica Chastain being one of my favorite actresses (Zero Dark Thiry, Interstellar, Crimson Peak etc.).The most trouble I got with this movie is - the dramaturgy. The actors are doing their job very well but tbh the whole movie (taking the issues of guns aside) is more kind of a social group study of a certain cast of ppl (politicians, media, spin-doctors, p.r.-ppl etc. - but as I am not in that kind of ppl involved I cannot determine how accurate the depiction is) as a drama. I wasn't involved into the characters nor in the ""issues"" but I watched the movie mostly with a feel of indifference, getting sleepy trying to follow all the endless dialogues and conference meetings and somehow stereotypical characters depicted, but I confess, at least I had the chance to admire the beauty of Chastain.So what's wrong!? In my humble view Miss Sloane mostly misses suspense, it's easy to see if someone compares the movie with the master-class of this genre - the screen adaptions of Grisham's books a la A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker and Runaway Jury etc., or lets say with political movies a la All the President's Men (Redford, Hoffman) - suspense!? Thrill!? Nada. All over characters who act and think like public opinion is some gameplay or ego-game - so the movie may reveal some truth about political bizz but it does in a rather boring way.Miss Sloane is kind of a educational movie and or description of how ppl and mechanisms in (may) Washington work and a monument for the eternal beauty of Jessica Chastain. And ofc some anti-gun-propaganda.So if you want to be involved into the political business in Washington or other places I can recommend this movie as a kind of teaching class for you, the aspiring next Emperor Ming, but if you want suspense and thrill and entertainment like I do, and even the real Armageddon, if not well executed, just gets a little arched eyebrow from you and you won't bother to get up from your coach, I just can't.",Miss Sloane
30,robert-temple-1,Really badly made,1,20 September 2017,"This is a terrible film, which I had to turn off before the end because it was essentially incomprehensible. The worst thing about the film is the extremely low quality of the sound recording. Added to that, many of the actors and especially Jessica Chastain speak so fast and so inarticulately that it is what I would call 'fast mumbling'. They obviously did this in order to try to supercharge their scenes and make them come across 'dramatic'. (When a scene is not dramatic enough, try shouting and looking fierce, and maybe viewers will be fooled into thinking that is drama.) But fast mumbling and ferocious grimaces are no substitute for a good script. This script is really, really bad. I hate to say that about a first time screenwriter, but it is true. And why were there no rewrites by other writers, as usually happens in cases like this? This script could have been shaped up by someone more experienced. Bad judgement call by producers and director. The story is rambling and people shouting at each other is not drama, it just isn't. Jessica Chastain overdoes it in trying to be a 'tough gal'. She is not convincing, but comes across as someone trying too hard. The director should have seen this and helped her out. Even bad casting can be 'handled', but it needs attention. The whole film is something of a parody, without any subtlety or sophistication. Compared to such a subtle and sophisticated TV series as HOUSE OF CARDS with Kevin Spacey, which roars like a lion, this film does not even qualify as a whimpering puppy cringing in a corner. The film has been much hyped, and a remarkable number of reviewers love it, but I fear they are kidding themselves. It is just not a good movie. Jessica Chastain is inadequate and is not all that the hype about her suggests. She also lacks 'screen magic', since she does not make for compulsive watching. When dealing with a subject such as this, the first thing to do is great a really sophisticated script written. Then you cast the lead woman with someone people cannot take their eyes off, i.e. someone who has irresistible 'watchability'. There are plenty of such actresses, but Chastain is not one of them, at least not in this kind of film. Also, an English director for a film about the intrigues of Washington lobbyists was a really bad idea. The film needed an American director who was more familiar with the many intricate subtleties of the complex American political scene than John Madden could possibly be, charming and talented fellow though he is. But he is English. He can tell you all about Shakespeare in love, but he is not versed in the ways of Washington insiders. And how could he be? This film is, I fear, an utter failure.",Miss Sloane
31,subxerogravity,"Good political drama, and a great performance by Jessica Chastain",7,29 November 2016,"I went to go see this movie simple because Jessica Chastain was in it. I'm a fan of her work in drama, the same way I'm a fan of Kristen Wiig in comedy, Zoe Saldana in Sci-fi and Michelle Rodriguez in action (Hopefully one day they'll let her get top billing), and this was great drama.It was never boring, Thank God! Cause these things can easily bore me. It's filled with a lot of political mumbo jumbo that was not fully easy for me to comply, but the emotional tones coming from the amazing actors really help me grasp all the legal stuff happening.Overall, Miss Sloane is a very political fantasy style movie, and I say this with a jaded tone due to where the U.S is politically right now. I feel like Miss Sloane is telling a story only true in Hollywood. It tries not to be that Hollywood formula, it's buried nice and deep but it gets there.Still, it is a well done story. I like when movies give you enough clear information that allows the viewer to understand and see where the movie is going, I especially like it when the movie is capable of giving the viewers a lot of twist and turns to try to toss you off the sent of what's going to happen, but at lease when it does happen the montage recap that you see in all movies like that is not out of nowhere. The clues are not just made up but were very clear from the beginning.The political thriller had me on the edge of my seat the whole time like it was an action movie or a horror flick, and Jessica Chastain has the kind of charisma that keeps you rooting for her, even though Miss Sloane is not always the nicest person.The film has grace and style and a great ensemble cast that includes Mark Strong, Alison Pill,John Lithgow and Sam Waterson, but keep in mind, this is Miss Chastain vehicle and she drives it well.http://cinemagardens.com",Miss Sloane
32,stevendbeard,Good Political Thriller,7,11 December 2016,"I saw ""Miss Sloane"", Jessica Chastain-The Martian, Zero Dark Thirty; Mark Strong-The Brothers Grimsby, Zero Dark Thirty; Gugu Mbatha-Raw-Free State of Jones, Jupiter Ascending and Sam Waterston-Law & Order_tv, The Killing Fields.This is a political thriller about a lawyer taking on the big and powerful gun rights advocates. Jessica plays the lawyer that is working for Sam, who is backing the gun lobbyists but soon decides that she can not work for them and quits and goes to work for Mark, who is against their policies. He is not in favor of taking their guns away from them but just wants tighter gun control background checks. Gugu is an up and coming intern at Mark's firm that has some personal history with gun violence. Jessica is one of the best there is at what she does- paraphrasing Wolverine-because she plays things as if it were a chess game and she tries to be one or two steps ahead of her opponents at all times. And, sometimes, this behavior leads to sacrificing her business and personal relationships, as in having no close friends or family. She is not perfect. She does take pills to keep her self going the long hours that she puts in and she also has other side habits that she tries to keep separate from her work life. Like I said, she is not perfect but she does like winning, no matter the cost. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you like political thrillers about special interest groups and bribery, then you will probably like this one.

33,alindsay-al,A good film with an interesting subject matter,7,5 February 2018,"This film has had positive word of mouth so I was interested in watching this film and I have now seen miss Sloane and I enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees a high ranking lobbyist take on a powerful opponent and realise what goes too far in a campaign. Jessica Chastain plays Sloane in this film and she does an excellent job in this film, she does a fantastic job in the emotional scenes to add weight to all the power scenes she is involved with. She adds a lot of depth to her character and makes you question whether you should be rooting for her and get behind her character. The supporting cast all do a great job, Mark strong plays her partner in this film and he does a great job. He plays off of her very well with Chastain and you see his point of view contrasting hers and making you question which way too look at the whole scenario. Guru mbatha-raw is a great actress and she has a truly good character in this film, the way her relationship with Chastain really develops well and you see both of their characters being put into tough situations and how she reacts feels very real. John Lithgow has a smaller role in this film but when he is on screen he gives his usual best to get the most out of the role. Everybody else in the film do good jobs in there roles to add to the film. The story is pretty complex and interesting, you see this woman attempt to do anything to make sure she comes out on top but you understand why she is doing it. However, I feel like that the subject matter could have had more shades of grey in it instead of the black and white nature that the film uses which I think missed a trick. Also there is one storyline involving a relationship for Sloane bored me and felt tacked on and unnecessary. The script has some really quick convincing dialogue that helped makes these characters feel more interesting, but I feel like they overcomplicate some of the dialogue and breeze over some important scenarios that leaves you a bit lost at times. The style of the film has some good dramatic scenes, especially in the courtroom scenes, where the drama is really good. Though, I feel that the pacing is a bit off and a good 15 minutes could have been shaved off the film's runtime and it would have been a better film.

Chastain carries this movie as you see her intelligence during debates as well as see her weaknesses by her laser focused solely on her job. While the movie addresses a multitude of pro-gun regulation points, it does powerfully hit on a couple pro-gun rights points.

Jessica chastain gives a real powerhouse performance as Elizabeth Sloane, a tough as nails lobbyist for the Brady campaign. Also here is Sam Waterson, who works for the gun lobby, and I really liked him in this role, he fit in it well and gives a good performance. I loved the great writing in the movie and the clever moves that are made. This political drama is so interesting and well constructed. Mark Strong is so good here too, chastain and him have a great on screen chemistry/presence too.

38,aharmas,An Intelligent Movie and a Marvelous Performance,10,10 December 2016,"It's just amazing how some people are unable to see what's real and not. ""Miss Sloane"" engages its audience by way of setting up the film as both a thriller and a political analysis of what people will do to succeed. Chastain outdoes herself, and that's saying a lot. She takes this role and sets no limits. It's a demanding and difficult characterization. She plays a woman who doesn't care what it takes to win, crossing the line, maybe even trying unethical methods to reach her goal.The film goes on to explore the arguments and the ongoing debates between the issue of gun control. At first, it all about the strategies, later it takes on the personal relationships of the people involved in the two teams competing against each other. As one of the characters tells another, it's a matter of annihilation, or is it anticipation. ""Miss Sloane"" plays like a chess game, and it's a thrilling experience to see how the pieces are moved. There are some unexpected twists, and sometimes they're shockers.The force that drives the film is Chastain. She commands the screen with her looks, her delivery of a dialogue that is rarely seen in movies anymore. It's direct, incisive, intelligent and doesn't make you feel like a dumb audience member. Instead, it triggers our desire to learn more about the subject matter, and how the entire system works.There are three sections in the movie. The introduction of the protagonist, Sloane, a professional who is seen as made of ice, professional to the extreme and feared by many in the business. Later, she takes on a crusade to pass a bill through, but matters are complicated by individuals who have much at stake, and there's the eventual resolution, a very entertaining and powerful set of scenes that take place in a court, but that are more exciting than usual, and much of that relies on Sloane's fire. She goes through a myriad of emotions, and the roller coaster ride leaves both the actors and us exhausted and satisfied.It is a disservice to call this film propaganda. Regardless of what side of the debate you support, the film is outstanding and a showcase for the talents of a good director, a smart script, and a golden performance by Miss Chastain.",Miss Sloane

41,bkrauser-81-311064,Unrealistic But Still Good,8,10 December 2016,"Part of what makes movies so important insofar as being cultural touchstones is occasionally they can capture the zeitgeist of the time. They inhibit a unique space after all; at the vector of art, commerce and entertainment. So it would make sense that when a movie pinches a nerve we tend to pay attention.Miss Sloane is not one of those movies. In fact, despite conscientiously and actively trying to be a happy warrior, the movie (largely through no fault of its own) settles for being woefully out of step with the rest of this season's Oscar bait. Critics and audiences alike have been excoriating the Jessica Chastain vehicle for being the ill-conceived amuse bouche of a Hillary Clinton victory. New York Times critic Stephen Holden referred to the film as ""small potatoes"" in light of the recent Presidential election while Lindsay Bahr of the Associated Press laments the film was ""crafted in a different climate.""To those who don't already know, Miss Sloane is the story of a singularly talented, and sought after K Street lobbyist who takes on Washington's gun lobby seemingly just for kicks. Sloane (Chastian) along with a gaggle of loyal staff set up shop at a small firm, immediately take the place over and shift their weight towards a gun control bill slated for a slow death on Capitol Hill. Her Machiavellian tactics immediately ruffle feathers among her new allies, firm head Rodolfo Schmidt (Strong) and liberal do-gooder Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw) as well as captures the ire of her former employers George Dupont (Waterston) and Pat Connors (Stuhlbarg). As the stakes are raised ever higher, it becomes clear to all involved that there is no depths Sloane won't sink to, to accomplish her goal.Miss Sloane is almost exclusively an acting showcase for the lovely Jessica Chastain who up until this point has proved herself in films as varied as The Tree of Life (2011), A Most Violent Year (2014), Zero Dark Thirty (2012) and Take Shelter (2011). Chastain's unexpected Hollywood rise has led to more memorable roles this decade than arguably any other actress. Here however, Chastain is completely off the chain, voraciously devouring the role and the victims of her machinations like a hungry python. Make no mistake the titular character here is a monster - as morally corrupt, irredeemable and she is frustratingly clever.The politics of the film are unabashedly liberal which could automatically alienate some viewers. Tucked away in the film's incessant quips and political jargon there are a few casual swipes at American gun owners that feel very on the nose. Yet before burning the film an effigy we should be cognizant of the fact that as a political thriller, the protagonists need to have a political stance of some kind - a cause worth rallying behind, a policy worth forwarding. What better stance is there for a formidable lobbyist whose looking for a coup de grace than going up against the most effective American lobbying group in history.Many have rightfully compared the look and feel of Miss Sloane to that of Scandal (2012-Present) while the dialogue has a Sorkin-esque bent that's purely West Wing (1999-2006). Yet Miss Sloane finds a comfortable space in-between those two political TV traditions keeping the quippy intelligence of one while playing with the bitterness of the other like a cat and its yarn.Of course that kind of playfulness can only get you so far which is why when the completely unique and not at all overplayed motif of money and politics has run its course, we're brought into Sloane's head-space as a damaged working woman. She hides her scars well, even from staff and perfect strangers that have nothing to gain but her trust. Perhaps these brief moments of humanization might be old hat to some but while Sloane was at her lowest I kept asking myself would I feel differently if the protagonist was a man?If there is one glaring problem in this film it's the third act; which builds itself up as a big juicy twist but ultimately feels like a cheat. The tension of Miss Sloane's non-linear story structure in conjunction with the film's very first lines ""Lobbying is about foresight"" definitely builds it up nicely, but once we finally get there it feels like the taut cord of suspension of disbelief has been completely severed. Perhaps if Miss Sloane was adapted into a TV show, the sweeps-week ending could have been forgiven but since the film doesn't earn goodwill on the part of any other character other than Sloane, the whole thing falls apart.That said, Miss Sloane is still a riveting little political thriller that is elevated to 11 by Jessica Chastain's brave, ruthless and calculated performance. It reaches the dynamism of films like The Contender (2000) and seems to have a lot to say about money in politics, women in politics and the brinkmanship that takes place behind the scenes.",Miss Sloane
42,shakercoola,"""A piece of work""",6,21 February 2019,"An American political drama. A story about a most sought after and formidable lobbyist in Washington DC who takes on a powerful opponent oand finds winning may come at too high a price.
Jessica Chastain's character describes herself ""a piece of work"" and her performance brilliantly portrays an ultra-obsessionist, tough, driven, uncompromising, smart tough-cookie with laser-like focus in a high-stakes world of political power brokers. The dialogue is witty, but there is a point to be made that the rolling conversations are delivered unnaturally fast at times to be believable. The story has some awkward exposition and backstory too, and it resolves too neatly with an unconvincing road to redemption theme.

47,rockman182,Miss Sloane (2016),6,9 March 2017,"My endearing love for Jessica Chastain means I will watch absolutely anything she is in to see the red headed goddess captivate me with her beauty. I think she's a fine actress (in her beauty and her acting ability). This film flew a bit under the radar in 2016; it seemed like something that was meant to make a few waves during award season but having seen it now, there wasn't too much to rave about. However, one thing cannot be denied, Chastain is a force to be reckoned with.Miss Sloane is about a lobbyist, and her dedication and unnerved attitude towards her job. The film explores her resolve and how it interferes with her free time and life, while also displaying what a powerful and unwavering lobbyist she is. The film also explores betrayal, the cutthroat business that she is in, and also some of the scandal involved in politics. The film is a political thriller. A lot of the film uses terminology that may really isolate a casual viewer. You have to really know what you are getting yourself into. Its not always entertaining and often feels like information is being thrown at you without really attempting to engage or motivate the viewer.I think the film is watchable due to Jessica Chastain being a powerhouse in this. Her character may not resonate with all viewers but its hard to deny the conviction with which she portrays Elizabeth Sloane. Its one of her strongest performances to date. She really disappears into her character and her character has some serious balls (for a lack of better terminology). I wouldn't have been surprised with a best actress nod at the Oscars for her super performance. She really saves the film from really fading away into obscurity.Chastain is brilliant, and the supporting cast do well to work a film that has too much political jargon to set itself out on its own feet. There are some really fantastic scenes where the emotion really hits out and it escapes its textbook style verbosity. Its a shame it doesn't happen more often. In conclusion, this film won't be for everyone. If politically driven films are your thing you would have a better judgment on how this film stands up to others of a similar nature. For me it wasn't very special.6/10",Miss Sloane
48,rzajac,Artistic Issues,6,22 April 2018,"Workable script, fully capable acting, good sets/costuming... but it looks like either 1) ham-handed direction, or 2) the director's interest in nuance tuned to the wordiness of the script getting derailed by the producers pulling rank.Could have been worse, but this is something towards which I feel especially sensitive.It highlights a really important fact about big budget production: Too often producers think they have the ingredients for something produce-able and distribute-able, but don't realize the demands that certain kinds of narrative place on the product. In fact, it looks like they don't even realize that the script, itself, should carry weight in that process. They defer to the knowledge they feel they have about the movie-going public; that too many of them are like babies with disposable income, who don't understand English but are innately attuned to facial expression and body language: And films are busy-box light shows of emoting.As a result, the film all-too-often squawks and gesticulates. The producers refused to let the script breathe.Too bad!Add to this that the script, itself, seems a little strained and the flick doesn't have much of a chance to work on its proper merits; a timely subject matter (guns), coupled with a well-intentioned ""insider"" look at political gamesmanship.I'm suddenly reminded of a time long ago, in university, during Watergate, when I went to meet with a student club to practice for an upcoming performance. Oddly, someone found us a practice space in a building that had adjacent conference rooms, and one of these rooms was hosting a convocation of monied suits considering bankrolling a rock band. I was invited in to listen to the tune and drop my own two-bits on the marketability of the song ""product"". The weird thing was that the band used a two-bit cassette recorder, and the tape was so bizarrely saturated that I couldn't even make out the melody... let alone the accompaniment! And certainly not the words. But think about the mindset of these dozen-or-so business dudes listening to this thing, driven to consider putting money behind it because... it was about Watergate.Well, art *matters*. Miss Sloane may be about guns--and very passionate it is about that. But it misses (a bit) as an artistic product.",Miss Sloane
49,dave-mcclain,"Controversy, corruption and callousness - oh my!",6,10 December 2016,"""Let's all go to the lobby. We'll get to talk with our elected representatives."" Well, that is how lobbying, the practice of attempting to influence legislation, got its name – at least 200 years ago. Today, lobbyists are often paid representatives of companies or causes and are usually viewed in a negative light by the public. Citizens and media decry the influence of money in politics and criticize the methods of many lobbyists. The U.S. has relatively tight restrictions on lobbyists' activities, but that doesn't mean there aren't bad actors in the profession. Given all this controversy, it may seem an odd decision to make a movie with a lobbyist as the central character, but if you have a compelling story, focused on a timely and controversial issue, and attract A-listers to star and direct you have ""Miss Sloane"" (R, 2:12).Elizabeth Sloane (2-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain) is one of the most successful lobbyists in Washington D.C. – and one of the most controversial. She has a reputation for having an icy personality and a steely resolve, for doing anything and everything necessary to serve her client – and for winning. She has virtually no personal life (except for her visits to a local gigolo, played by Jake Lacy), she has insomnia (for which she takes pills – and then other pills to stay awake – so she's always working) and she's a ""conviction lobbyist"". She only works for a cause for which she has strong personal convictions.When George DuPont (Oscar nominee and Golden Globe and Emmy winner Sam Waterston), partner at the law firm where Miss Sloane works, assigns her the job of working with the gun lobby to help defeat a bill requiring more stringent background checks for gun buyers, she laughs in his face, then quits and takes most of her team with her. Only her young mentee, Jane Molloy (Alison Pill), and Pat Connors (Michael Stuhlbarg), her liaison with the firm, stay behind. Of course, she's leaving the firm with a purpose. She has been hired by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), the President of Peterson Wyatt, which opposes the gun lobby and is working for passage of that bill, the so-called Heaton-Harris amendment.Miss Sloane gets right to work. She's a force of nature in the Peterson Wyatt conference room, immediately integrating her team with theirs, explaining her strategy and insisting that the campaign in support of Heaton-Harris can win. She gives everyone their marching orders, gets almost everyone on board, and either gets rid of or ignores those who stand in her way. Miss Sloane befriends a young Peterson Wyatt employee named Esme Manucharian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), while energetically and unapologetically playing her role in the plan – employing a combination of savvy, creative, unethical and even illegal methods – and never with the prior approval of the increasingly dissatisfied Mr. Schmidt.It's her bull-in-a-china-shop approach and lack of a moral compass that eventually gets Miss Sloane in big trouble with her employer, her team, and Congress. A committee, led by U.S. Senator Ron Sperling (2-time Oscar nominee and multiple Golden Globe and Emmy winner John Lithgow), investigates her and calls her to testify. She's annoyed at the process and strays from her lawyer's advice during the hearing, but she did tell/warn him that a good lobbyist ""plays her trump card just after they play theirs."" ""Miss Sloane"" features an anti-hero as a main character and focuses on one side of a highly controversial issue, but manages to be a surprisingly engaging movie. You'll marvel at Miss Sloan's skill, even as you are repulsed by her personality and/or her methods. Chastain brings this complex and troubled character to vivid life and still manages to make her somewhat sympathetic. She's backed up with a terrific cast, which includes some of the best character actors working today, not to mention a stable of promising newcomers. The script by first-time screenwriter Jonathan Perera and the direction of Oscar-nominee John Madden make a compelling case for increased background checks, but give very little voice to the other side of the debate. The film portrays the gun lobby and their political allies as unreasonably unyielding, cynical and amoral, as it puts the people on the other side in a sincere and almost heroic light (except for Miss Sloan herself). (The words ""National Rifle Association"", ""Republican"" and ""Democrat"" aren't used, but it's clear who is who.) In addition, some of the plot points feel contrived, but, as a whole, this is one entertaining and interesting film. ""B""",Miss Sloane
50,agmoldham,Intelligent movie,7,1 June 2017,"The movie is based around Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) who is a political lobbyist. She decides to lobby on the controversial (in the USA!) issue of gun control. Sloane is used to winning and that is her sole goal with any proposed legislation. Whether people get hurt along the way is irrelevant to Sloane. She treats lobbying like a game of chess whereby you have to predict and counter the oppositions moves. The movie is a bit like a cross between West Wing and Wolf on Wall Street. It's entertaining throughout and whilst something doesn't quite ring true with the main character, well worth a watch.",Miss Sloane
51,jrarichards,Mind-blowingly intriguing intro to the world of Washington lobbying,9,16 November 2017,"Remarkably, what looks like the ultimate inside track on the workings of Washington comes from British Director John Madden and Asian-resident writer of Portuguese descent Jonathan Perera. They can be rightfully proud of their achievement, which looks supremely - scarily - authentic, even though for moments at least, it seems to be descending into comedy, only to recover its composure again quite rapidly. If that is an intentional approach (and who is to say it is not?), it is both interesting and unusual, and only serves to further raise the class of the film.Obviously, the makers here are helped along massively by a splendid performance from Jessica Chastain as the titular Liz Sloane. Chastain achieves something rather miraculous (or at least she did with this viewer). So intricate is her version of the art of lobbying that - in early parts of the film - her belting out of instructions to her team that are as devious as they are complex went entirely over my head. Having first chastised myself, I later paused to realise it was a compliment. Without at least 6 months of experience of what Sloane herself dubs a ""rotten"" system, I am obviously going to lack the necessary cunning and immorality. Sloane has of course mastered all that long since, but is anyway driven, powered along by pills, eats every day in just one restaurant for the sake of sustenance, has nothing or nobody but her work, consorts with a male prostitute from time to time to simulate the necessary part of married life, and has no regrets whatever that she has no more ties than that. Hence, in the early part of the film, she looks like a thoroughly obnoxious, and certainly very scary, person.But Chastain works her magic in the role, and at some point begins to look more and more skilled, masterly and - let's not beat around the bush here - pretty darn sexy. What's more, she evokes a measure of sympathy/empathy that comes out of nowhere, entirely unexpectedly. Somehow, she makes a heroine our of herself, on the basis of her 100% anti-hero status. Conceivably, there might actually be something deep in her persona that a person could even love (all the more so as she reveals a new aspect to herself in the altered circumstances present at the end of the film). This is then a force-of-nature, yet actually quite nuanced kind of performance which looks like work of a high level.Quite a few other familiar faces can be made out in the film, mostly playing worse-than-pond-slime roles; but a joyous exception is Mark Strong (effortlessly supporting an American accent in place of his otherwise much-in-demand British one) - playing perhaps the only lobbyist in America with a few scruples still intact. Jake Lacy also offers a surprisingly warm and well-done performance in his apparently-rather-thankless role.Ultimately, this persuasive, slick, unusual and plausible film seems to offer both an entertainment and an education at one and the same time, and I am grateful to have come across it.",Miss Sloane
52,bob-the-movie-man,A gripping and enthralling political thriller for all lovers of the West Wing,9,20 May 2017,"In a roller-coaster year for political intrigue on both sides of the Atlantic, and with all hell breaking loose again between Trump and 'The Hill', here comes ""Miss Sloane"". Jessica Chastain ( ""The Martian"", ""Interstellar"") plays the titular heroine (I use the term loosely): a pill-popping insomniac who is working herself into an early grave as a top-Washington lobbyist. The game of lobbying is, as she describes, staying one step of the competition and ""playing your trump card just after your opponent has played theirs"". But all is not going well for Elizabeth Sloane. For the film opens with her being on trial for corruption in front of a congressional hearing, chaired by Senator Sperling (John Lithgow, ""The Accountant"").Through flashback we see how she got to that point, moving from one firm headed by George Dupont (Sam Waterston, ""The Killing Fields"") to another headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong, ""Kick Ass"", ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") against the backdrop of the high-stakes lobbying around a new gun-control bill. Her fanatical drive to 'win at all costs', and the trail of destruction, through her cutthroat work ethic, that she leaves behind her, digs her an ever-deeper hole as the political and legal net closes in around her.Jessica Chastain has played strong and decisive women before, most notably in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but probably never to this extreme degree. Here she is like Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but not played for laughs. Miss Sloane is an emotionally and physically damaged woman, but a formidable one who takes charge both in the boardroom and in the bedroom, through the unashamed use of male escorts (in the well-muscled form of Jake Lacy, ""Their Finest""). As such her character is not remotely likable, but one the I could certainly relate to from past business dealings I've had. (And no, I don't mean as a male prostitute!) I found Sloane to be one of the more fascinating characters in this year's releases: I was never being sure whether her actions are being powered from a background of strong moral conviction (fuelled by a devastating childhood incident perhaps?) or through pure greed and lust for power. I thought Chastain excelled in the role, but for balance the illustrious Mrs Mann thought she rather overplayed her hand at times.Outside of Chastain's central performance though, this is a very strong ensemble cast. Mark Strong – not with an English accent for once and not playing a heavy – is great as the frustrated boss, as is the seldom-seen Sam Waterston (who, by the way, is the father of Katherine Waterston of current ""Alien: Covenant"" fame). Christine Baranski (so good in ""The Good Wife"" and now ""The Good Fight"") pops up in a cameo as a flinty Senator. But the outstanding turn for me was Oxford-born Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Belle"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" – and yes, I'm aware of the irony in this pairing!). Playing Sloane's colleague Esme Manucharian – both a lady with a secret in her past as well as possessing a great name – Mbatha-Raw is just riveting and deserving of a Supporting Actress nomination in my book.What binds the whole two hours together is an extraordinarily skillful script by debut writer Jonathan Perera, which has both a gripping and ever-twisting story as well as a host of quotable lines. Ladies and gentlemen, we may have a new Aaron Sorkin on the block! It's a brave script, dealing as it does with 2nd amendment issues, since there seems to be nothing that stirs up American comment like gun-control. For those living in the UK (where gun deaths are over 50 times less per capita than in the US) the whole topic is both fascinating and perplexing. The marvelous Cinematography is by Sebastian Blenkov – the second time this gentleman has come to my attention within a month (the first time being ""Their Finest"").The director is Portsmouth-born Brit John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") and he does a great job in sustaining the tension and energy throughout the running time. This all makes it a great shame that the film has not done well at the US box office, perhaps because ( the film was released in December 2016) the public had more than their fill of politics after a bruising and divisive election. (I'm not sure the UK release date now – just before our own General Election – is wise either). But for me, this was a memorable film, and come the end of the year it might well be up there in my top 10 for the year. I'm a sucker for a good political thriller with ""All the President's Men"" and ""Primary Colors"" in my personal list as some of my favourite ever films. If you like those films, ""House of Cards"" or remember fondly TV series like ""The West Wing"" or (for those with even longer memories) ""Washington Behind Closed Doors"" then I would strongly recommend you get out and watch this.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

53,abisio,One of 2016 best movies ignored by public and academies,9,15 March 2017,I originally ignored Ms Sloane because I believe was another of those courtroom movies with heroic characters that are not at all like the money starving and lazy lawyers I know. I pick up interest when I found out it was about Lobbyist (a profession very few people know about but is well know that control politics). Miss Sloan was one of those pleasant (and obviously sad) surprises because pretty much reflect the reality of USA politics during the last year; with a Congress controlled by Republicans and with everybody trying to stay afloat and blame everybody else with the recent crisis. Miss Sloane is a combination of the best of Michael Clayton and the unexpected twist of THE STING; however this time focused on politics. Jessica Chastain has an special ability to act like a bitch so she is only perfect for the character. I cannot imagine any other actress doing this so well and the movie would never work with a male character.The underline theme is basically the fight for stronger weapons selling controls. Something we know is almost impossible to get with a powerful and deep pocketed lobbyists but the movie dares to go there and explain us perfectly well the level of corruption in government and elected officials.Why Miss Sloan failed at he box office like Ang Lee 's Billy Lynn Longs Halftime can only be justified on the sad fact that American public prefers to ignore those things that show realistically the moral corruption in our Country. What is even worse is that critics basically kill both movies. Why was that ? The Arms dealer lobbyist also ?In brief; please invest in this movie your time and money because these movies has to be made in order for us to become more educated,Miss Sloane

55,JohnRayPeterson,The movie is an orgasm for the mind,9,25 December 2018,"This two year old political thriller is one you need to watch if you've missed it before. Tired of flashy special effects flics, fantasy or bang bang shoot 'em up with martial art big screen productions, hungry for an intellect teaser that satiates you? Well then, Miss Sloan is for you.I'd read the Europacorp storyline on IMDb to start with if you haven't heard of the movie; then I'll add here for you to read, my semi spoiler: A driven lobbyist leaves big firm to work for smaller one because she is hungry for the big impossible win that could catapult her at the very top; she takes on the gun industry that is represented by the firm she quit, to represent the gun control movement represented by a boutique, as she calls it, lobby. You will think of Miss Sloan as a, forgive the language, 'b i t c h' for most of the movie because it's intended, but you will admire her in the end, as her most outspoken critic, attorney Daniel Posner, played by David Wilson Barnes, did.The dialogue is at times delivered at dizzying speed because the characters have minds that think that quickly and with beautiful precision. The plot, as you'll no doubt discover with delight, is like a chess match between Magnus Carisen and Garry Kasparov; you can almost predict the outcome, not quite, but you couldn't guess when, how, let alone why it had to be, until you saw it with your own eyes and had time to reflect on it while the movie credits roll down the screen.Director John Madden has an impressive filmography and I am not the least bit surprised that twice Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain, star of the movie, wanted to do this film as she read the script. Both Madden and Chastain were on board from the start and the quality of the script explains also why it was produced in such a short start to finish record time.The cast has some of my favourites, John Lithgow, Mark Strong, Sam Waterston, Allison Pill and many others. They performed brilliantly, like a well synchronized philharmonic playing anything from Litz to Wagner. It's a joy when each performing contribution fits like clockwork and never misses a beat. You can't fault anyone.The writer, Jonathan Parera, wrote Miss Sloan, his first foray in screen writing using Aaron Sorkin approach and style, and when he teamed up with fame director John Madden, nothing short of a winner was in the works.
There is implied sex, but no nude scenes, gun shots are fired, but no one dies, all is focused on the development of the story, nothing unnecessary is used to make the movie work.
I highly recommend it it if you like brilliant written thrillers.",Miss Sloane
56,timdalton007,A Thriller For Our Time,8,13 July 2017,"There's a line in an early episode of Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing where White House chief of staff Leo McGarry (played by the late John Spencer) tells the staff that ""There are two things in the world you never want to let people see how you make 'em: laws and sausages."" Yet the process by which a bill becomes law has proved to be rich ground for writers and filmmakers from Advise & Consent to Aaron Sorkin efforts like The American President and the aforementioned West Wing. More recently, filmmaker John Madden has turned to the lobbying efforts that help make bills law for his film Miss Sloane, starring Jessica Chastain in the title role.It is Chastain's performance that in many ways anchor the film. From the moment the film opens with Chastain looking into the camera and telling the viewer (and, as we discover, her lawyer) that ""Lobbying is about foresight,"" she draws you into this sometimes murky world where morality is a method determined by how far one is willing to go. Chastain portrays Elizabeth Sloane as an intelligent, resilient, powerhouse of a character who is not afraid to say what she thinks and play the game that she sees lobbying as to the hilt. She's also an imperfect character with a host of vices that threaten to be her undoing at times as does the realization that the game she plays might well have stakes she can't accept. There's always a sense at once of both fierce determination and vulnerability to the character that makes Chastain's performance utterly compelling. It is no wonder she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress as her performance alone helps make the film what it is.There's a strong supporting cast as well that reads like a who's who of present acting talent. There are familiar faces in the cast such as Sam Waterston as Sloane's one-time boss turned adversary, Mark Strong as Sloane's new boss who struggles with her methods in spite of hiring her, and the always reliable John Lithgow as the senator at the center of the film's framing device. The film also has strong female roles for its supporting cast as well including Alison Pill as Sloane's assistant Jane and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Slone's confederate who ends up thrust into the spotlight alongside a cameo appearance by Christine Baranski. It's a solid cast all around who nicely back up Chastain's central performance.Beyond the cast, there's a finely made thriller on display. There's a cool, cynical tone to the entire film that is perhaps best emphasized not so much by the script from Jonathan Perera but in the combined efforts of the cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov, the production design of Matthew Davies, and costume choices of Georgina Yarhi. Bright colors, even soft ones for that matter, seem to be a rarity in this world which gives the film a slightly dour, suppressed feel with which the drama is painted across.Drama supplied by screenwriter Perera and director Madden. Miss Sloane fits firmly into the political thriller genre despite, or perhaps even because of its subject matter. Despite its setting in the apparently everyday politics of Washington and Capitol Hill, many familiar tropes are in play. There's blackmail, bribery, threats of violence, manipulation, and even espionage. While the film picks gun control legislation as its subject matter, one feels that its subject matter could be about any number of hot button issues and still be relevant to the here and now of 2017. That is something one suspects both helped and hindered the film as it was released at the tail end of the most bitter American presidential campaign in recent memory where similar issues about a powerful woman in the middle of political circles were part of the state of play. Yet the points it makes, perhaps in something of a preachy manner, in its final scenes are valid ones that will likely continue to haunt Washington and our political discourse for years to come.Whatever the case may be for why audiences didn't see the film in cinemas, Miss Sloane is a thriller for our time that casts a strong, female lobbyist in the role of anti-hero. It takes the current Washington landscape which it turns into a fascinating thriller which examines that sphere of power and the people who occupy it. Audiences didn't find the film in cinemas might find it now that's it on disc and streaming. If they do, they're in for a treat.",Miss Sloane

I think that's one of the reasons that this movie didn't get seen by as many people that it probably should have. Miss Sloane makes clear which side of the debate their on but they objectively show the arguments for both sides. The movie also dives into the dirtier sides of lobbying. The backroom deals, the two-sided nature of the business, the playing for the cameras and setting up publicity stunts are all addressed and put under the microscope. It reminded me a lot of the tone and style of House of Cards and I mean that as high praise.I'd also like to mention that the plot is very streamlined and the movie moves at a very quick pace. There are small subplots but the movie rarely includes things that aren't going to be important. Remember that while there are scenes that seem like you can duck out to get a snack, this movie requires your full attention to keep up with it. You also gets some top-shelf dialogue and interactions between the characters are interesting and add a lot of personality to the players in Miss Sloane.You have your supporting players in Miss Sloane but this is about Elizabeth Sloane as a character. There's heavy parallels to be drawn between Sloane and Frank Underwood; they both don't have any problem getting their hands dirty, they have ice flowing through their veins when they're in the pressure cooker and even when they're answering to their superiors, they're always in control. It was refreshing to have this character written for a woman and I think this is a good film for feminists. Sloane is a really interesting character, she's despicable (she willingly screws over her friend and co-worker Esme to get ahead) but I never found her boring. I respect the writers for taking this route where she doesn't have to be a hero, she's a different kind of anti-hero and I tend to prefer that kind of character as a protagonist.Jessica Chastain is one of the top 10 A-list actresses working in Hollywood today and I was happy to see her get a vehicle like this. She can do just about anything from action/thrillers (The Debt) to dramedies (The Help). She's great and she nails this role. There's some heavy hitters in the supporting cast; Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, John Lithgow and even Alison Pill. They're all really good, there wasn't a weak link among them and they helped give this movie the professional feel it needed.This is a movie that operates as a tightly wrapped package. It brings you into this world swiftly, it gives you a main character that is impressive to watch despite her faults and throws you into this whirlwind battle without a life jacket. I can see this movie turning off people in favour of easier access to guns (the movie pokes fun at and demonizes the NRA) but I didn't have that problem. I do fall on the side that this movie is clearly on but I think you can enjoy it either way. This movie is a character piece and ultimately a chance for a versatile actress like Chastain to show that she can do a legal-style thriller. She pulls this off effortlessly and it was easy to respect this movie both for it's subject matter and it's top shelf leading performance. Miss Sloane accomplishes exactly what it wants to and I don't think it will be nominated for any awards (Chastain's performance is award worthy in my opinion) or make top 10 lists. Conversely, I still had a great time watching this and I hope more people will get a chance to see it.",Miss Sloane
60,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,29 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...When you are a cutthroat lobbyist - you have no friends, no allies, no blueprint. All you have is the desire to win, no matter the cost - even if it means your own career. Just as long as you are the winner.And that is exactly what Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is. This is the story of Elizabeth Sloane, who is lobbying for senatorial votes to support a new bill that would enforce a stringent background check on gun purchases with the ultimate goal of reducing gun violence. In her efforts to wage war against her former firm, she is willing to give her all and sacrifice all to win. Always staying one step ahead of her opponents, always having a trump card ready to play when they play theirs - at the highest of costs.This was a well played out narrative with strong performances. Jessica Chastain was convincing and extremely effective in carrying this film, absorbing herself into the role of the ice cold lobbyist, willing to do whatever it takes and not caring about the consequences she will have to face in the end. Her character always has a sharp wit and even sharper tongue - but is limited by her tunnel vision, failing to care enough about those around her as she pursues her goal. Winning is more important to her than anything. Anything. And she knows this. There is no room for friendship when you have a job to do. Like she says in the movie, ""I'm a piece of work"".Overall, I did enjoy this film. It was entertaining and with a good ending. I was a little disappointed in her ""trump card"" though, and without revealing what it was, I will just say it was rather simple and cookie cutter. As simple as it was, it was effective. Also, the film runs a little long, but is able to hold your attention until the end. I would recommend this one if you enjoy a good political yarn.",Miss Sloane

The gun lobby and the US Senate. For the US Senate to question a lobbyist over ethics is a mind boggling conceit. We all know lobbyists own the senate and congress. So does the NRA.

63,ClaytonDavis,'Miss Sloane' Is Ruthless With a Monstrous Turn by Jessica Chastain,7,12 November 2016,"In a time of fiery debate, just following a tumultuous election year, nothing is as timely or educational as John Madden's politically charged ""Miss Sloane."" Constructed by a crackling script by Jonathan Perera, in his boisterous debut, the film is rich in words and helmed by an enigmatic turn by Jessica Chastain. Emulating a second coming of Aaron Sorkin in his prime, Perera, in partnership with Madden's distinct vision, creates an orchestra of dialogue and story, all leading to a genuinely surprising finale.""Miss Sloane"" tells the story of a brilliant and ruthless lobbyist, Elizabeth Sloane. She is notorious for her unparalleled talent and her desire to win at all costs. When she goes rogue to push a gun control measure in America, her career and morals are put at risk.Firmly entrenched as Elizabeth Sloane, Chastain manages one of her finest performances yet. Nimble in movements but nearly paralyzing in line delivery, the Oscar-nominated actress is unparalleled in her sheer excellence and commitment to the craft. The twist and turns of the tale allow her to precisely land each punch to the stomach with advancing intensity. It's a complete and marvelously unstoppable force that is worthy of Academy Awards consideration.Not acting alone, Chastain is supported by a strong cast. Gugu Mbatha- Raw's sensitive and affirming work is magnetic, even if the character's opportunities are not fully discovered. As the vulgar but intriguing opponent, Sam Waterston makes a case for Hollywood to remember that he still remains Oscar-less after an impressive career. Staying in the lane of ""sleazy challenger,"" Michael Stuhlbarg is able to do this role in his sleep and just make it look too easy.Sprinkle in a love interest from Jake Lacy, a corrupt senator from John Lithgow, and a revenge seeking former employee from Alison Pill, and you have one of the year's most snappy and creative ensembles.""Miss Sloane"" is an intelligent and informed look into the corruption of politics. It shows the vigorous nature in which politicians yearn to keep their positions and how our leaders are often picked and sabotaged. Engaging the audience with its chilling resonance, the film is often beautiful in its slick and smooth exterior, blended with its dark, and even at times creepy undertones of American politics. Weighty and ardent, its reduction of emotion can be a distance for some, perhaps even off-putting. The cynical and vivacious storytelling method could even be pushed as outrageous to a general movie goer or critic. Its hypnosis is darn strong in every frame. Chastain fills each scene with a fervency, delicate in which she lays them from her luscious lips and all too stylish business suits.""Miss Sloane"" crackles with excitement and performances. A riveting game of cat-and-mouse, standing toe-to-toe with other political machinery films of the last few decades. It unmasks the raw, honest truth of the system. As a portrait of power, the high tension and cynicism can be hauntingly charming. You can get wrapped up in its webbed-up world of civics and government. It is a simmering gem to the year.",Miss Sloane
64,CineMuseFilms,"A gripping thriller of Stiletto power, political corruption, and stopping the gun lobby.",7,2 April 2017,"Stiletto power, political corruption, and stopping the gun lobby: that sums up Miss Sloane (2016). But like everything in cinema, describing its contents is easy compared to explaining what this film is really about. At one level it loosely belongs to the superwoman genre that inspires shock and awe at what women can do, only this time in the halls of political power. At another it is an exposé of political corruption in which lobbyists game the system that we refer to as democracy.Miss Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a super-smart lobbyist who is ruthless, cunning, untrusting, and will stop at nothing to win her cause. She knows the game of politics inside and out, and is both respected and feared for her win-at-all-costs approach. Her private life is messy: she is an insomniac, a substance abuser, has no friends and hires escorts for late night wind-downs. We meet her answering a Senate Committee about some procedural irregularity, then the story plays in flashback where we see her walking out on her employer because their client, the firearm industry, opposes even the mildest gun-control reform. She takes most of her team with her to a smaller but principled firm that gives her a free hand to win over uncommitted senators in supporting new gun laws. The firearm industry is spending mega-sums of money to block the laws and Miss Sloane. She is also fighting against her former employer and colleagues. They know what she is capable of and it scares them.The storyline is a classic 'femme fatale battles the big boys' except that Miss Sloane is no blushing rose. While she is fluent in both corporate-speak and the language of social-principle, she is an amoral political warrior who waits to see the whites in her opponent's eyes and then strikes for maximum carnage. At this level, the story plays out like a gripping political thriller and Jessica Chastain is brilliant in depicting the twin hydra-headed monster of attractive woman and political assassin. This is not a big-narrative film packed with dramatic action. Rather it is dialogue-rich and viewers will need to be alert for the rapid-fire jargon about the politics of gun control. If you stay with the flow, it is a film full of insight into how single-issue politics can be manipulated by lobbyists who distort the institutional relationship between elected representatives and the law-making process.Some may describe this as a post-feminist celebration of powerful and smart women, others as an endless talking heads fest. There is no doubt that feminism is in the frame because if it was called 'Mr Sloane' then suddenly there is no story. That alone is an indictment of how far we have progressed in the equality domain. If you have ever worked in government or have an interest in the political process, this film is highly engaging; if not, don't bother. It is a tense thriller with several twists and turns, but none greater than its elaborate and contrived finale.",Miss Sloane
65,david-meldrum,Satisfying And Morally Complex,7,8 February 2020,"A morally complex story about gun control lobbying and legislation in Washington, D.C.; Jessica Chastain leads a strong cast, in agreeable scenery-chewing form, a character as compromised as everyone else around her.Despite the complexities, however, there is much that is Sorkinesque in the plot beats, the dialogue and tendency towards grandstanding; a grandstanding that is understandable in the realm of gun control given how ineffective subtlety seems to be. Unfortunately the film suffers from a final few minutes that strain credulity, but overall the film is both stimulating and entertaining.",Miss Sloane
66,daniel-mannouch,"Great drama, superbly acted",7,1 August 2019,"Miss Sloane stars Jessica Chastain as a ruthless Washington lobbyist risking everything on behalf of her ethics. Chastain is a solid lead in this well polished hybrid of character study and political thriller. The film feels very much in the now in that the exposition needed for a high concept plot is pushed through characters you are so busy loving to hate to notice the lack of a second dimension or even the simplicity of the narrative.The real ace up this film's sleeve is the clarity with which the lobbyist trade is presented. How influence over senators is sown, reaped and paid for. If an understanding of what a lobbyist actually does is what you're looking for, then you will get a lot of insight here. Playing out like a combination of Mad Men and House of Cards with some Devil Wears Prada thrown in for good measure, Miss Sloane wisely focuses upon the mechanics of this highly controversial, if not wholly parasitic profession. The behind closed doors activity of the build up to a senate bill is well dramatised here to the point where i can say that it is even informative.So, what we have is good, if not great acting, a fully loaded plot and high quality production value. I've described this film, I've also described several HBO mini dramas. What makes the feature length film Miss Sloane a feature length film is a question I want to ask. It's refreshing to cover a direct to DVD film for once that warrants this amount of minoucha i wanna add.I can pinpoint it to two things, one is the condensed character arc of the protagonist, second is the economy of the dialogue. Whether it was because of Chastain's performance or the intensifying manipulation of the score, but Sloane's outbursts over issues she really cares about feels very conscious on the part of the film. I am conflicted whether this interferes with the flow of the picture or plants the flag emotionally within a plot which is at times very hard to follow, especially when the film descends into mumblecore now and again.Secondly, as I said, the dialogue is at times too straightforward, even when considering the world in which the film inhabits. This as well was very noticeable and i consider it to be a necessary evil and it was a good decision to sacrifice dramatic resonance in order to sustain the pace of the film. There could have a better score, the more dynamic cinematography, but i think there is enough to make Miss Solane a proper feature film and not something resembling a TV drama omnibus.In conclusion, Miss Sloane is a high recommendation as a really good drama and political thriller.",Miss Sloane
67,Magow-Intermean,Miss Sloane Review,8,8 April 2019,"Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a feared DC lobbyist who angers her boss by turning down a job for a pro-gun group. She quits and moves to a firm which is backing a proposed law to impose regulations on firearms. But which side will win?
Smart, hard-nosed and blunt to the point of rudeness, Elizabeth Sloane is the kind of boss who has her underlings simultaneously cowering in fear while still craving her favour. If this film was made a decade ago, you could imagine her being played by Nicole Kidman (or, going further back, Linda Fiorentino) but in today's market, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job than Jessica Chastain. She inhabits every inch of this steely, powerful character who strides into boardrooms and instantly commands the attention of everyone present - rivals, employees, the audience.Chastain gives it everything she's got.
Chastain's performance is absolutely crucial to the success of this film, and she gives it everything she's got - amping up the kind of focused, driven intensity we saw in Zero Dark Thirty, while still bringing a glimpse of the vulnerability she displayed in Interstellar. A driven, busy woman, she keeps her colleagues at arm's length, doesn't appear to have any other friends and hires a male escort when she wants sex. It's this relationship that reveals most about who Sloane is - she's perturbed when, instead of getting her usual guy, another man, Forde (Jake Lacy), turns up instead. Reticent initially, she begins to see him more regularly and it's then we glimpse her true self.But, as is to be expected in films like this, the chief pleasure of Miss Sloane is watching her let rip at her colleagues and adversaries. However, there is a flip side - the most painful moments are when she does the same to her subordinates, something which crosses the line into emotional abuse. Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings warmth and heart as Esme, one of the favoured ones, but you sense that her place in the pecking order is precarious. She's not the only one: Sloane herself is putting her career on the line for the cause of gun control, although for some time it's hard to tell whether it's because she believes in it, or because she wants to prove she can win this particular battle.
Elsewhere, the film is dialogue-driven to an entertaining but almost exhausting degree: Aaron Sorkin is an apparent influence for debut screenwriter Jonathan Perera, a Brit who was working as a teacher in South Korea when his script got Hollywood attention. Inevitably, it's not as razor-sharp as Sorkin's work, but it's still a slick debut from a writer who claims his heroine was partly inspired by his mother (the good bits, anyway). Able supporting performances come from Mark Strong as Sloane's new boss Rodolfo Schmidt, and Alison Pill as her one-time right-hand woman Jane Molloy, although smaller characters tend to lean towards the simplistic.
It's a far cry from director John Madden's usual cosiness, seen in the likes of Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and by the time the ending comes along, some audiences may have lost patience. It's the kind of film that leaves questions in its wake in terms of plot detail, character background and even practicalities - where does she find the time to do her hair and make-up so professionally? If she's going for twice-daily blow-drys like Anna Wintour, we don't see it. But it's still an enjoyable two-plus hours and an impressive calling card for writer Perera, not to mention another feather in the cap for the Golden Globe-nominated Chastain. An Oscar nomination wouldn't have felt out of place, either.Hard to root for but mesmerising to watch, Sloane is expertly portrayed by Chastain in this dialogue-heavy lobbyist thriller that should please fans of both actor and genre.",Miss Sloane

69,coreyjdenford,"Powerful Lobbyist, muddled misinterpretations.",6,12 May 2017,"This review of Miss Sloane is spoiler free*** (3/5)OBSESSION IS THE key behind any powerful role, an actor will get into the character and portray them so well they turn obsessive. Jessica Chastain is one in particular for taking obsessive roles, in Zero Dark Thirty she played one of main operatives behind the capture of Osama Bin Laden, Crimson Peak's Lucile Marsh was obsessed with getting her own way. Miss Sloane is her most obsessive and most powerful character yet.As Elizabeth Sloane, a powerful, yet formidable lobbyist in D.C she is obsessed with winning, taking in her stride to become the most powerful force in America. She and a small team of cronies are tasked with banning the gun law in women, not taking no for an answer she does anything to win the vote of powerful senates around the D.C area. All characters here want play Bond when they try anything to get the senators votes, this of course goes well in Elizabeth's eyes but to the eyes of others, it doesn't work. Although she does most of the talking, she sends out her most loyal employee, Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw) to do the technical work by talking on TV and providing information about guns, this plan works until Sloane brings Esme's past into the mix, betraying her without sympathy. There's a lot more betrayal along the way, essentially Sloane is like a singularity that sucks in all the sympathy from her peers and doesn't give any back, also she wants to protect women by giving them strength but she doesn't care for feminism, she just wants to win her rights. But when she has to take on the most opponent she's ever faced, she finds winning comes at a higher price. But as unsympathetic as she is, there is charm in her in a compelling moment when she runs a mockery of her court case, the obsession takes its place when she still gets her own way. She's also a challenging character, as far as she is very obsessive, there's heft in her too, she suffers from insomnia and has drugs to get her to sleep at night. And with Chastain's sensational performance everything relatively works well. As compelling as Director John Madden makes it, it's not perfect there are a couple of flaws, the main flaw is the jaunty screenplay, mostly the story writes itself throughout the film, but there are a couple of lines that fail to stick. And all the political and statistical uses it has it's all undone - seemingly dumbed down by its ending. That said, even if you don't like politics or statistics being rammed in your ear, Miss Sloane is thrilling, compelling sometimes challenging and with Chastain's sensational performance there's still something here to enjoy. VERDICT: Chastain is sensational in this compelling lawsuit thriller that packs in a lot of political and statistical heat, which is sadly undone by the dumb final moments.",Miss Sloane
70,Ramascreen,MISS SLOANE packs a verbal punch and a shocking twist you'd never see coming,9,20 November 2016,"MISS SLOANE has officially joined the ranks of my favorite political thrillers of all times, such as ""All The President's Men,"" ""The Ides Of March"" and ""The Insider,"" basically films that make the people wonder if our representatives work on behalf of us or on behalf of corporate USA. Jessica Chastain gives a daring and cutthroat performance. With a script by Jonathan Perera that carries the same speed, intellect, and spirit as anything that Aaron Sorkin has written, MISS SLOANE packs a verbal punch and a shocking twist you'd never see coming.Jessica Chastain plays Elizabeth Sloane, a lobbyist whose desire is to win at all cost but unlike any lobbyists, she actually sticks to her values, which is quite rare these days. So when she goes up against gun manufacturers that practically want to buy votes for a certain bill that's being debated over, Sloane finds herself in a fight that can put her own career at risk. MISS SLOANE pulls back the curtain on how politicking is played in D.C.Directed by John Madden who gave us ""Shakespeare In Love,"" those ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" movies and had previously teamed up with Chastain on ""The Debt,"" Madden keeps a tight lid on much of Sloane's secrets from the audience, which I think is a brilliant move, because throughout the film, it keeps driving us into one direction where it seems that Sloane could win but something happens and all of a sudden her chances become slim to none. Just like the character herself, the film aims to surprise you at every turn, you get to see how both sides of the aisle try their best to outplay and outwit and out-expose one another even if it means using your own colleagues as a means to an end. It's a ruthless game not for the faint of heart nor for the compassionate, it's a question of whether or not compromising and manipulation can be justified in the name of idealism.I think Jonathan Perera's script is very smart, it's very cunning and that's exactly how Chastain approaches it as well. The Oscar-nominated actress is so fierce and magnetic, Chastain is the Faye Dunaway of this generation. As Sloane, she bulldozes anything in her path. One of the best, most impeccable performances this year. Movies like MISS SLOANE could discourage those college students out there that are studying political science because once they get their feet wet, they'll discover the cold hard truth that David Vs. Goliath doesn't even come close to describing how uphill the battle is or how rigid the system can be. But perhaps if you play it like a chessboard when you can anticipate your opponent's moves and you control the narrative and you have a secret piece you keep till the very end, even when you have to sacrifice every other pawn in the process, you might just win.-- Rama's Screen --",Miss Sloane
71,ginocox-206-336968,Brilliantly crafted film that falls victim to its own conceit,6,20 April 2017,"""Miss Sloane"" is excellent in many respects, but deeply flawed in others. The labyrinthine plot is worthy of a spy thriller by a top author of John LeCarré' s caliber, with double-crosses, deceptions, misdirections, subterfuges, and shifting loyalties. Performances are excellent, particularly by Chastain and Strong. Production values are outstanding, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. It's most distracting fault lies in its conceit. The film tries to make a dramatic argument in favor of requiring background checks for all firearm sales. But the arguments presented by the characters seem better suited to a high school debate than a multi-million-dollar lobbying effort. If somebody had asked me, prior to seeing the film, I would have likely responded that background checks don't seem like a bad idea. But watching the film, I wanted to reach through the fourth wall, grab the characters by the shoulders and ask if they were going to let Sloane get away with such sophomoric reasoning. After watching the film, I was much more skeptical about the value and effectiveness of background checks, as well as the integrity of the gun-control lobbyists. At one point, Sloane compares background checks to requiring driver's licenses. But licenses don't keep the idiots off the road or prevent the tens of thousands of traffic deaths each year or prevent people from driving while intoxicated. But the gun lobby guys sat back in stunned silence, as if Sloane had presented such a profound argument that any response was impossible. At several points, the film was not dramatically satisfying because Sloane claimed victories that it didn't feel she had won because her opponents let her walk over them. Perhaps they dummied the film down for mass audiences, but that doesn't make sense, as most of the film is very intelligent and it takes a bit of mental effort to follow and keep track of all the players. Much of the film is smoke and mirrors. Perhaps the actual message concerned corruption in government and the influence of powerful lobbies. But it felt as if the filmmakers were so enamored of the political statement they wanted to make that they didn't feel they had to make it convincing. Chastain's Miss Sloane is a brilliantly complex and multidimensional character. She's dynamic, manipulative, passionate, shrewd, knowledgeable, and yet emotionally hollow, self-centered and abrasive. The arguments she presents in favor of universal background checks seem far too shallow for somebody of her intellect and her commitment to the cause seems quite arbitrary, particularly compared to her chameleon-like approach to whatever issues her clients ask her to represent and her disinterest anything not related to her work.",Miss Sloane
72,mgd_m,Could have been better,6,16 April 2019,"It's a nice watch, I mean it keeps you entertained till the end, once you catch up with a story that starts too fast. On the other hand, the political environment and the characters (including Miss Sloan) are just too filthy to leave you with a good vibe.That being said, as a movie it has some positives and negatives. I appreciated Jessica Chastain, of course, and her character, who is very sharp and more deep than it seems. I appreciated the thrills, the final twist, and the fast pace. The main plot is well written.But, I see three major flaws. First, Miss Sloan seems to have a supernatural intellect, her plots are just unbelievable, and this make the movie feel a bit fake and unsatisfying. Secondly, the supporting characters are just monodimensial sidekicks for supernatural Miss Sloan's show (Mark Strong in particular should have been given a more important part). Third, the first half is a bit forced, it's full of fast spoken lines that pretend to be witty, as if the writer was trying at all costs to build a smart and appealing environment; the second part is more natural and he finally succeeds, but that's exactly because... it's less forced.Overall it's an entertaining watch with an outstanding actress, but not much more.Oh, and the guns thing: it means nothing, they could have talked about pink tigers and the movie would have been the same.

74,srdjan_veljkovic,Anti-gun feminist propaganda disguised as a thriller,3,1 January 2019,"There are a few worthwhile moments in the movie, mostly some jokes and puns, but, in general, its propaganda is showing way too much. It tries to show that pro-gun (2. Amendment) people don't have any justification for their position rather than ""it's the Constitution"". I mean, sure, it's fine to be on one side of the issue, but, trying to depict the other as simply idiots is _not_ fine. Don't show them at all, if you wish, show them very little, that's all fine. But, this, this is just terrible. Worse, their (her) position doesn't make sense. She advocates a bill to make background checks when buying guns compulsory, then compares that to driver's licenses!? She's _not_ advocating introducing gun licenses, so the comparisons is meaningless. Yet, she's supposed to be super-smart.Jessica Chastain's performance was praised, but, it seems by those who share these views. In reality, the only good thing is the consistency with which she plays Miss Sloane. But, she plays a soulless, misguided and unbelievably smart and powerful woman. Such a woman can't really exist, so, how can we say that she did a good job playing her?So, as a ""position statement"" or ""character study"", it is terrible. As a thriller, it's simply way-too-flawed. I don't care what drugs you take, if you're in your late 30s / early 40s and work 16 hours a day, and have been doing that for decades, you will be a half-dead zombie. You will _not_ be able to out-smart the whole gun lobby with their millions of people and dollars.Most of the twists make no sense what-so-ever, but let's focus on the last one. So, she anticipated that they will attack her, then gave them evidence to incriminate her, only to show evidence of their corruption?! She could have just shown the evidence of their corruption to the press and not incriminate herself. She wanted career suicide? Well, just incriminate yourself right away, that'll do it. She wanted to also win? Hm, she does want a lot, doesn't she? But, even so, there is no real reason why this would make it easier to win. The corrupt senator will not vote on any bill any more (and it will be a long time before he's replaced), so, that 's a _negative_ for her - it would be more prudent to _turn_ him on her side. Others will simply be appalled at the tactics employed by her lobby, including spying on their colleagues. There is actually _no_ _way_ that her bill would get the 60 votes after that. Most likely, the bill would be withdrawn and maybe tried in a few years, when the dust has settled.Also, I don't know if this was an inside-joke, but, when she instructs the people at the Senate hearing to go to a website with evidence of senator's corruption, she gives an IPv4 address, with last part being '.449' - this is _not_ a valid IPv4 address, it has to be at most '.255'. The inside joke here being ""the whole thing is as valid as the IPv4 address"".The most bare propaganda is at the end, when she says that prison is OK, ""if you don't have a penis"". According to her, women form support groups in there. I mean, this is just brain-dead. We all know what goes on inside women's prisons. Sure, it's different than in men's, but, these are not ""tea party and gossip group"" social clubs.It's a shame to some extent. Some ideas are OK, providing a one sided view is also OK, Jessica Chastain is actually well cast here. But, they just went way too far and made a piece of propaganda.Just skip it, even if you are an anti-gun feminist.",Miss Sloane

This film made me sit up and pay attention right from the start.No doubt much of the attraction is down to Chastain, who captivates and mesmerises from the moment she appears. But also it's down to a clever and unpredictable plot that does just enough to keep your brain interested, without being so complex that you just can't be bothered.I love this film and Chastain's performance.

78,ccorral419,"Oh, Miss Sloane...",8,30 November 2016,"One of today's ""it female actors"" Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty - 2012) joins once again with her ""The Debt"" (2010) director John Madden. While Madden excels in interpersonal relationship films (Shakespeare in Love, - 1998, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - 2011), his ability to personalize the unlikeable character falls short. Chasten is tough and sought after political broker Elizabeth Sloane, who will turn on her friends, take down her enemies and do anything for ""the win"". Here, she's fighting for gun laws, and Congressman Sperling (John Lithgow), former boss Gorge (Sam Waterson) and co-workers Emse (Gugu Mbatha-Raw ""Beyond the Lights"" - 2014) and Jane (Alison Pill - ""The Newsroom"" - 2012- 2014) beware. Surrounded by an array of solid ensemble characters, with nice breakout performances by Noah Robbins (Grease Live! - 2016) and sexy Jake Lacy (Carol - 2015), ""Miss Sloan"" is 3/4 set-up and wordy aggressive dialogue and 1/4 thriller and excitement. Chasten will probably be recognized at award time, and she deserves the attention. However, the overall film left me wanting a reason to care for ""Miss Sloane"".",Miss Sloane
79,lucasnochez,Film Review: Miss Sloane,6,9 February 2017,"If you haven't figured it out already, The Newsroom, the cancelled and highly underwetched, underrated, and heavily missed HBO Dramatic series from the ingenious Aaron Sorkin is absolutely one of my all-time favourite television shows ever created. Given the quip dialogue, snappy political, social and cultural references, not to miss, its absolutely miraculous comedic timing and concurrent content, it is not only one of the best shows to ever premiere on television, but also a necessary viewing. Now if you're thinking, why in the heck am I mentioning a television show that has nothing to do with the current movie in review, the answer iseverything!Miss Sloane may have been made by any of the talent who brought to life The Newsroom, but add the inclusion of two of the major actors in the show, plus a very apparent and suspicious comparison in delivery of dialogue, and mix all that with one of the best satirical and comedic lobbyist films in Thank You for Smoking, Miss Sloane is a lobbyist film that falls short in over two hours of misconstrued, flashy, politically polished and governmentally red-taped dialogue that not only keeps audience members at bay for the majority of the conversations between characters, but really only keeps the hopes for viewers that the final scenes and pivotal and totally expecting twists by the films end, are so worth this long-gestated and over-winded drama.The story is simple; Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is the most sought after and ambitious lobbyist in D.C. Set against a world of high-stakes power-brokers, government officials and corrupt businessmen, Miss Sloane is up against her toughest opponent when she's pitted against the heavily armed and lucratively funded arms industry of the United States of America. Leaving her own firm to join forces with a once formidable opponent Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), Miss Sloane must learn to trust people and others if she wishes to win one of the biggest cases of her life, which is something she is completely unfamiliar with. Upon learning of Miss Sloane's departure from her current firm, Sloane is surprised in finding that not all alliances are what they seem to be, including her right-hand ally Jane Molloy (Alison Pill), who abandons Sloane and partners up with her opposition. Left with a handful of strangers and new faces, Sloane must learn to work with others or suffer the consequences of taking on too much and inevitably finding her demise to the all-too-powerful United States government and its ties to the very powerful corrupt arms organization.While many films this year have the gracious feeling of being heavily scripted and quite theatrical, Fences and Una for example, the overtly scripted Miss Sloane has its characters reciting lines throughout the film rather than delivering them, especially since the film relies heavily on courtroom jargon that mostly takes the audience away from the story. With the exception of Jessica Chastain, who seems to relish in the highly convoluted word-play of screenwriter Jonathan Perera's debut script, Chastain elevates to a singular level of performance and acting in Miss Sloane. It is safe and easy to say that Chastain is the singular character who carries her dialogue, the narrative and flow of the film effortlessly, while each and every actor in the film seems to be playing catch-up.While Miss Sloane can easily be judged as a political thriller, the thrilling aspects in the film rely heavily on action/reaction shots of the highly unexpected revelations of its supporting characters. Foresight and overshadowing certain, very touchy, issues dealing with sexual abuse, violence and emotional tragedy, seems to keep Miss Sloane afloat for the majority of its runtime, although, the high anticipation of the verbal sword fighting between characters acts more like cinematic action pieces than narrative adrenaline, something The Newsroom does without trying.As the stress along with the cat-and-mouse games between Sloane and her adversaries unfolds, many questions arise, that are rarely answered, which is frustrating for a viewer. More than anything, one of the most aggravating aspects of Miss Sloane is a lack of empathy or history behind the protagonist's main ambitions. Sloane, a woman who shares nothing with her peers and amongst her employees, shares a very routine life that sees her eating at the same restaurant each and every night, while her main emotional connection/release is burdened to a very inquisitive and highly curious male escort named Forde (Jake Lacy). The interactions between Forde and Sloane are amongst the best in the film, easily giving audiences a mild understanding of Sloane's psyche, even when audiences question whether or not a high-stakes lobbyist would actually share such delicate and classified information with, essentially, a high end male prostitute.As the screw turns slowly on this story of deceit and manipulation, it becomes clear that anyone and anyone is a pawn in the very damaging game Miss Sloane is playing. Cutting off relationships, friendships and people with the blink of an eye, Chastain's portrayal of an emotionally damaged and voided social individual is quite spot on. Closing in on resourceful counter-measures, Miss Sloane is constantly questioning her moral and ethical means to winning, while many of the supporting characters, most notably, Rodolfo, bring Elizabeth back to Earth, and ground her intentions of winning and the many choices she make to appear and come out victorious.While professions and government professionals are questioned, surprised and many times, reduced to nothing, Miss Sloane relies heavily on its conclusion and final scenes, to surprise audiences with unbelievable revelations about characters that not only give the film immunity but the time the closing credits roll along, but also make the unbelievable, believable.",Miss Sloane

84,ReganRebecca,Chastain shines in a solid political drama,7,9 December 2016,"Putting politics aside, I had a thought half way through Miss Sloane that this exactly the kind of solid mid-budget adult drama that just doesn't exist anymore. The script is a showcase for its lead actor, in this case Jessica Chastain, who takes the character and runs with it for all its worth. The movie may falter, the script may offer one too many twists and turns, but there is Chastain in the middle of it all, as our titular pill-popping work obsessed anti-heroine, willing to push herself and others to the brink in the pursuit of her goals. Elizabeth Sloane, when we meet her, is riding a career high, lobbying to pass or block bills as the case may be on behalf of wealthy clients, dancing on the border of legality. Opportunity comes in the form of an NRA group looking to tap into women's groups in order to convince them to buy more guns. Sloane is opposed, not for any personal reasons but because she sees basic gun control as sensible and supports it. When given the opportunity she jumps ship to an underdog lobbying firm and she and her ragtag group of lobbyists set out to help pass a bill for basic gun control while up against the big money and dirty politics of the NRA. Chastain essentially is the movie, owning every shot she's in. She's helped out by some greats who show up for brief scenes, among them Sam Waterson, John Lithgow, Christine Baranski, character actors who infuse gravitas and life into characters with only a handful of scenes. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is also a standout as one of Sloane's more ethical colleagues. The costuming is another standout; no one aside from Sloane stands out (there are a lot of drab suits), but Sloane gets some beautiful black and white pieces that fellow fictional D.C. insider Olivia Pope would happily wear. A solid thoughtful drama, worth the price of admission as a Chastain showcase.",Miss Sloane

However, it does show the absurdity of peoples reactions both on IMDB and in the film to what is after all was such an innocuous small change to the law and the lengths politicians will go to depending on how it affects their political aspirations.If you can't see past your own blinkered vision and accept that its a great story backed up by fine performances by everyone involved especially Chastain, then I feel sorry for you, if however, you have an IQ above that of an amoeba then prepare yourself for a really enjoyable, captivating, roll coaster like 2 hours of your time.",Miss Sloane

She delivers the most devastating cutting lines with understated inflections, totally owning the dialogue and the character. The character is complex, morally ambiguous, but that's exactly what this film is about, and Ms Chastain delivers and more. This is not some cheap feminist gender PC movie or character. Miss Sloane is so complex you soon forget any gender issues you might have dragged in with you. Just as the scintillating acting makes you forget that you're watching Ms Chastain, so thoroughly does she morph into the character. Ms Streep, Mr Day Lewis, I hope you're paying attention.

91,Tanay_LKO,Miss Sloane - The Lobby Vigilante,7,6 April 2019,"As a championing lobbyist for gun-control, Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) guns ahead with her foresight on her own will to prove a majority on a Government bill whilst keeping a keen sight on opponent's moves. Seemingly, more than her own people come for blood - both on the bill and hers.Playing a game of chess much like poker, she paraphrases her game strategy as to go notches beyond oneself to tell and prove something real - where ""own interests are best served by doing the right thing for society as a whole"". So, come the motive being browbeaten, threatened, publicly humiliated - what does one do?The film astounds with the depiction of how lobbying seems corporate-like - in good way and otherwise. At times, the motives depicted seemed blurred in plain sight with pacey dialogues and deluded. Confusing as it may seem, still maybe that's how films treat our minds - we feel enough to stay.
Who knows, in the process we may also end up appreciating human virtue.
Hence, even though it's easier said than done - ""principles actually mean something when they are inconvenient to be followed"". Headstrong, hardboiled and you name it, our lady doesn't bendThankfully, big words, come along with bigger action. This film has an intricate screenplay (from first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera) sprawling with minute details on government lobbying for pushing bills into laws with articulate moves to thrust heroics of maneuvering the debates and people alike.
The screen-acting by the cast, though simple, comes as the grand motivation to not set this film down. In specific, Chastain is the reason that I wanted to watch this film and I am beyond glad to have done so.Also, glad enough to have remembered what could be best put in a quote from ""The Contender"" - ""Greatness... sometimes it comes in the form of 'sacrifice' - that's the loneliest form.""",Miss Sloane

94,jasontheterrible,"Hollywood is so afraid of honesty, they made a ridiculous farce",1,27 March 2018,"There is something being pushed in every film. This one wants gun control. But Hollywood made the argument so laughably false the film bombed huge. The gun advocates are stereo-types, caricatures; old white southern males. They guffaw, laugh haughtily and deride without intelligence, Hollywood is terrified of making their ""rational"" argument without lies. The announcer says ""last year 374 mass shootings..."" and that was just for starters. There has not been 374 mass shootings in the entire history of the USA. Miss Sloan says ""we just want background checks because a terrorist can buy a gun."" Both claims are absolutely false. They never mention that Illegals killed 50,000 unarmed Americans in only five years. Naturally they refuse to defend our borders to stop this.Their solution to gun deaths is take our guns away. Where do people think guns will come from if they are banned in the USA? Mexico of course. Hollywood scriptwriters give brilliant actors powerful speeches but never reveal the facts. They are afraid we will not agree with them if we know the truth. On that single point they are right. The big argument here is: ""we do not want to take away guns, only close a few loopholes,"" but that is a lie.Adam Corolla illustrated with cigarettes how the left operates. They tell you ""we just want to close the loopholes."" The first thing they said about cigarettes was ""we just want to keep them away from the kids"" (give them pot instead) so new laws forbade selling to minors. Then restaurants put in no smoking sections. Then they banned cigarettes in the whole restaurant. Then they banned them in bars. Then they banned them in all buildings and now they are targeting homes. The left never just wants what they tell you. They lie.They attacked meat in the 60's and switched everyone to cereals because of several fraudulent studies. Immediately obesity began skyrocketing. Why? Because cereals raise blood sugar too fast and then it crashes and we are hungry again so we eat more and more. Meat is vital protein that does not raise blood sugar and meat keeps you eating less because we are sated on less food much longer. Why did they want people to get really fat and sick? Because they wanted us in need of massive health care. People were far too healthy, active, and independent in the 60's.I looked up the government statistics. There are almost 4 million home. invasion robberies and 32,000 deaths from them annually. Almost none occurred at homes where gun ownership was probable or neighborhoods that were known to be armed. The UK has far more robberies per capita than we do. 9,000 Americans per year are killed by illegals and about half of that from guns. The other half by vehicles. We also know that areas where guns are illegal have even more crimes and deaths by criminals. Criminals can always get guns. None of these facts are mentioned. No opponent of the caustic but superior Jessica Chastain is reasonable. How does the terrible phalanx of right wing white males take down the beautiful Miss Chastain? A dubious and salacious personal attack. Now that sounds all-too familiar in Washington D.C., but never from the right, always from the left.",Miss Sloane

98,makleen2,132 minute commercial for gun control,4,20 September 2017,"Miss Sloane (2016) stars Jessica Chastain as a high strung, pill-popping Washington DC lobbyist who takes on the Gun Lobby in this dead-on-arrival political thriller. Elizabeth Sloane is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in Washington, D.C., but when her firm agrees to take on an effort to convince women to support the 2nd Amendment, she has a change of heart and joins a lobbying firm fighting for gun control.According to IMDb.com, Miss Sloane had a budget of $18 million and made an embarrassing $59,797 in its opening weekend. As of December 14, the movie had grossed $2.6 million. Ouch. All indications point to a decent film. Good pacing, unexpected plot twists, solid acting–so what went wrong? Well, audiences don't really want to sit through a 132 minute commercial for gun control.Let's start there. It's not surprising a political thriller would have a political message, but this film wears its bias on its sleeve. It is replete with left wing stereotypes of conservatives, who it portrays as elderly white men enthralled to the gun lobby. When confronted with a plan to create a pro-gun women's group, Miss Sloane is flabbergasted, unable to believe any woman would support an originalist view of the 2nd Amendment. (Oops, those groups already exist, WAGC and AFA to name two.) Through Miss Sloane's later exposition, the audience is actually treated to a point-by-point refutation of arguments against gun control, making you feel like you're attending a lecture rather than watching a movie.Suspension of disbelief is an important element of any fiction. The audience is willing to accept incredible or fanciful events so long as those events adhere to a certain internal consistency or logic. Miss Sloane's premise, however, was simply unbelievable. Elizabeth Sloane is portrayed as tireless and high strung, a control freak who pays for meaningless sex, uses others to further her goals, and employs illegal surveillance techniques. She is, in short, a sociopath without empathy who until that point was willing to take on any lobbying effort as long as it paid.So we're expected to believe that when it comes to gun control, she suddenly feels powerful pains of conscience that lead her to put her entire career, her freedom, and her reputation on the line? Perhaps something in her past compelled her to feel so strongly about this particular issue? If so, it's not even hinted at. Her decision to put everything on the line for this cause is simply not believable.Equally unbelievable is her incredible foresight, in which she is able to gain the upper hand over her opponents even in the face of a Congressional investigation and jail time for illegal surveillance. The audience is led to believe Sloane anticipated these events and planned for them months in advance, all while flying around the country to put together a multi-million dollar political action committee. While a satisfying and clever ending, it stretches suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.As an anti-lobbying film, Miss Sloane is inferior to Casino Jack (2010), a Canadian film about real-life lobbyist Jack Abramoff staring Kevin Spacey. That movie also tanked at the box office, but at least it was entertaining, clever, and true-to-life. Like Elizabeth Sloane, Jack Abramoff enjoys peddling influence, but he maintains his character to the bitter end. He never suddenly develops a conscience because the plot requires it.People go to the movies to be entertained, to escape the stress and monotony of daily life. After a contentious election in which politics saturated the airwaves and social media, does anyone really want to sit in the theater and watch a two-hour long finger wagging session on lobbying and gun control? So far, audiences have stayed away from Miss Sloane, answering that question with a resounding, ""No!""",Miss Sloane
99,Beachbum2018,Excellent,8,26 August 2021,"This is an excellent movie.I lived and worked in the US for several years and from my time there came to better understand the complexity surrounding the 2nd amendment and why opinion is so polarised. In the end guns don't kill people, people do, easy possession of guns just escalates risk and consequence.The story was about guns as much as it was about a corrupt political system, the twist through the story could have been achieved with another issue like corruption, but guns it was.The movie was very well scripted and directed. A slow burn at times but with a decent pace so you never lost interest and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.Acting throughout by all was excellent with a special mention for Jessica Chastain in the female lead and a big thumbs up for Mark Strong, both exceptional actors who portrayed their movie characters very well. JC's character was utterly believable even if the plot was a bit less so, but overall it all worked.Fast becoming a big fan of JC's work, she seldom has a bad movie!Lost 2 stars for a slightly incredible plot and a tendency to slip into smart talk at times, but it didn't detract from being entertaining.",Miss Sloane

Contrary to the claims of those giving it high ratings, the issue of guns IS central to the plot, action, character motivations, almost everything.

That's pretty rare, contrary to open carry types' wishful imaginations of themselves as Dirty Harry.The problem with the film is that, as it deals with lobbyists, it must given us long expositions of talking points on all sides.

Yes this film pertains to gun control issues but delves even further than that into lobbying, political ""careers, and the mess out democratic system is in. This is not an opinion about our political system, it is a fact. There is more than one or two actors in this film that provide excellent performances and will make you think even after leaving the theater. People shouldn't even write a review if they haven't even seen the film. They need to look up the definition of film review to what that requires of a person before writing it. That type of action is right up there with ""fake news"" that people read and make decisions on. Trust me, this is not a false review.See this film and I can guarantee it will make you think of what makes the most sense in this country in this century.",Miss Sloane
102,blueoysterdvp,Great Movie,10,15 July 2021,Surprised the box office numbers weren't larger on this one. Now that it's on Netflix you have nothing to lose. Jessica Chastain is outstanding. The entire cast does a great job actually. The writing is excellent. The plot keeps your interest. Very clever at that. Controversial topic still to this day. I suspect the lower ratings are from gun enthusiasts.,Miss Sloane

104,Molongirl,Despicable me,6,13 September 2017,"Great acting, good plot with a nice twist at the end. BUT, I found this movie quite frightening, more so than your normal ""horror"" film, the main reason being the utterly amoral main character (and its truly frightening that one reviewer found her ""sexy""!). She is self-obsessed, arrogant, ambitious, rude, narcissistic, manipulative, totally unlikable, etc but despite all this I feel we are expected, in the long run, to admire and begrudgingly like her, why? because she was amazingly clever and most importantly she won. Is this seriously the most important thing in the long run? Is the perception of American society having a ""win at all costs ""mentality actually true? I hope this makes people question their values and leads to discussion on morals/ethics etc and the realisation that no matter the issue, that you don't have to cheat in order to catch a cheat, to become a villain to catch one etc. Hopefully such discussion was the writer's intent, its just such a shame that it was via such a truly despicable character.",Miss Sloane

107,rogier-86785,A political heist movie with lots of tempo,9,20 September 2019,"This is a great movie that is suspenseful right up to the very end.Miss Sloane is a political heist movie rather than a political thriller. You're never sure who is doing what exactly and where everyone stands, right up to the end. And it's got that heist-tempo, that fast rhythm that keeps you guessing.The film sparked up some mild controversy at release because the subject matter is a Senate bill on gun reform. This is a touchy subject only for Americans however, so any non-US watcher will be totally fine. Plus, while having an opinion, the film leaves the gun-debate itself surprisingly open with a great twist. The subject itself is therefore only a means to an end: to show how corruption works.No real niggles, performances are excellent, shots are great, director inspired... it's not a perfect ten though because the script can be a little over the top. But the exaggerations do suit the film. While keeping its cards close to its chest, it'll make you feel it has a very, very good hand. And when all cards are finally on the table in the finale, it does not disappoint.If you're anything like me, you'll be hanging on the chastised Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) her lips every single second.",Miss Sloane
108,gliderguy,Tedious leftist drivel for the already indoctrinated,1,1 May 2021,"This movie pushes a clear anti-2nd amendment agenda to those that have already been so persuaded (just read some of the 10 star reviews and you will see what I mean). It would be much more watchable to those less brain-washed if it weren't so doctrinaire. The movie's protagonist, Miss Sloane, considers her mission so critical that she is willing to do 5 years hard time in its cause. The mission? To get background checks on gun sales. NEWS FLASH: there already ARE background check on all legal gun sales (well before this movie was made, too)! Been there, done that. This is just leftist propaganda to make you think that this is a gaping loophole that must be filled at all costs. PURE GARBAGE! Let's have a movie about REAL gun violence, like the type that is happening in Chicago EVERY DAY - violence that the police are having their hands tied trying to prevent it.",Miss Sloane
109,Stewball,Not as biased as it might first appear.,8,12 December 2016,"Fasten your cerebral seat belts, its going to be a bumpy ride. Superb writing and performances, especially by Jessica Chastain. It was exhausting just trying to keep up, especially since there isn't any physical action that would allow you to rest and recoup the contents of your brain pan. My only fault is that it tries too hard to be even handed, switching back and forth on the 2nd Amendment issue a dozen times, up until Sloan reveals the depth of her and the Establishment's bankrupt souls at the end. For physical action junkies, there is one sequence involving guns, but I'm sure that won't be nearly enough for those who require a ""Fast and Furious"" level of check-your-brain-at-the-door action.",Miss Sloane
110,cschultz-2,"Aims High, But Misses",7,12 December 2016,"Sometimes a problem or a complex situation can be clarified by examining it through the impartial eyes of people unaffected by the issue. And that's both the primary strength and the major weakness of Miss Sloane, a new political drama released this week by EuropaCorp USA. Miss Sloane takes a quintessential and controversial American issue—gun control—and places it squarely into the hands of European filmmakers. And although the film's producers insist the picture is not intended as a tirade or a criticism of United States laws governing access to firearms, it is ultimately impossible to see the picture from any other perspective. Set in the world of Washington insiders and political power brokers, Miss Sloane details the experiences of a fictional lobbyist, Elizabeth Sloane, described as the most formidable and sought-after political activist in the nation's capital. Sloane, we are told, is known equally for her intelligence, her cunning and ruthlessness, and her single-minded pursuit of success by any means. When new legislation is proposed and gains traction in Congress which would increase accountability and background checks on gun buyers, Sloane is assigned by her firm's director to work with the National Rifle Association to defeat the bill. But on a whim of principle, Sloane impulsively decides to leave the firm for a more sympathetic agency, and instead use her particular skills in an effort to have the controversial legislation enacted. Written by first-time screenwriter Jonathan Perera, a British citizen living in South Korea, the project was optioned by Europe's Filmnation Entertainment, where it attracted the attention of British filmmaker John Madden, best known for 1998's Shakespeare in Love, the winner of seven Academy Awards. And Miss Sloane is extremely well-made, with a brilliant performance by Jessica Chastain in the difficult and vastly unsympathetic title role. Chastain has become one of our most talented and versatile actresses, with a string of noteworthy appearances in critically-acclaimed pictures such as Interstellar and The Martian, but also finding time to appear occasionally on Broadway and in interesting little horror pictures such as Mama and Crimson Peak. With an icy blue-eyed stare and ruby-red lips, dark power suits, alabaster pallor and fingernails lacquered black, Chastain's characterization of Sloane is of a person so single-minded and focused that she seems barely human—a bloodless, pill-popping, bullets-for-breakfast Princess of Darkness preaching a gospel of accomplishment at any cost. While supported ably by a cast including such old pros as Sam Waterston, John Lithgow, Dylan Baker, and Christine Baranski, Chastain is in firm control of the screen from the first frame of film to the last, although she's nearly matched in power and intensity by British actor Mark Strong, sporting an eminently persuasive American accent as Sloane's employer. Miss Sloane stakes its claim in writer Aaron Sorkin's territory, but with the signature rat-a-tat American vernacular dialogue Sorkin has displayed in A Few Good Men and television's The West Wing filtered through the European sensibilities of screenwriter Perera. As a result, where Sorkin could've made the words leap and soar, the rhythm of Perera's phrasing is often labored and flat and the tempo plodding and stagy, like swing music played by a marching band. And the jaw-dropping denouement of Miss Sloane needs to be seen to be believed, although in retrospect clues are scattered like crumbs throughout the picture. Dating from the earliest film adaptations of Dickens' A Christmas Carol and A Tale of Two Cities in 1910 and 1911 through Schindler's List in 1993 and up to the present time, a popular device of motion pictures has always been the amoral character who experiences an epiphany of conscience and as a result becomes an altruist and a humanitarian. And that general description fits Miss Sloane. But lying beneath the moralistic fiber of the picture is a rich vein of cynicism, an observation not assuaged by director Madden's haste to get the picture into theaters quickly: After principal photography ended in mid-October, the filmmaker sped Miss Sloane through post-production and astonishingly completed the picture in time for a premiere at the American Film Institute Festival on November 11. A wide national release followed on December 9, coinciding with an international debut that same day at the Dubai Film Festival. Madden remarked recently, ""I wanted to get the film out this year because I didn't want us to get out-of-sync with the gun issue. My views come as no surprise. But it's not my country, and it's not my issue, though from a humanist standpoint I'm entitled to my view on it."" Indeed, the tone of the movie is uneven enough to unnerve the NRA and other opponents of gun control, who have unsurprisingly taken to openly criticizing Miss Sloane, even in some cases without having seen the completed picture. And with a debate in the United States as vehement as the regulation of firearms, any uneven handling of the issue, no matter how well intentions, will inevitably result in division and dissension. But although the filmmakers acknowledge candidly that they expected an enormously different and more sympathetic political climate to prevail by the time of their picture's release, the point remains the same: When a contentious political situation is presented in a manner which is more favorably weighted to one side of the debate, drama can run the inherent risk of becoming propaganda. As such, although thematically relevant, sharply intelligent, deeply effective, and extremely well-crafted, Miss Sloane probably—and unfortunately—cannot be judged as anything other than a curio, and a fascinating failure in its intent. While it's revealing to view the argument through European eyes, possibly in the hands of American filmmakers Miss Sloane could've found the moderation it needed to examine the issues more fully. Miss Sloane aims high. But ultimately the picture misses its mark by pulling just a little too far to the left.",Miss Sloane
111,f-rabit,Awesome,10,20 March 2017,"This movie is awesome. One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Very strong emotionally. The performances are top notch; all of them. But In my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved at least an ""actress in a leading role"" nomination. She achieves a better performance level than Natalie Portman - ""jackie"", Isabelle Huppert - Elle"" or even the winner - Emma Stone in ""La La Land"". Again, my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict. It's absolutely astonishing. Loved it.",Miss Sloane

But, it is far more than that. It is a most excellent exposé of the DC lobbying business. One that shows how lobbying is successful in influencing the outcomes of key legislation agendas, and manipulating the legislative process for good and evil ends. I would consider it more about modern politics than about any on important issue. The gun debate was merely the chosen vessel around which a plot could be spun. Great cast, compelling story line, excellent cinematography. It reminded me of the emotions evoked in me by the likes of award winning movies like The Firm, The Chamber and even A Few Good Men.

What a gem of a movie! After a long time I saw a movie which had dialogues to remember, fast paced screenplay and a performance par excellence by Jessica Chastain. I am not American so the movie was a revelation of sorts on their political process. I give only 8 as the ending felt a little contrived. Sad it didn't get the attention it deserved when it was released and Jessica Chastain was not nominated for a Oscar. She lives the role, impossible to even imagine anyone else in the role. One thing that I kept waiting for , was the background on why Sloane is the way she is, the director kept hinting on a reveal which never comes.

The movie truly delivers on how democracy can be bent to someone's will and the people's true will becomes instead second place to a few people's interests. It is really gripping and engaging and despite overly subtle hints, the final twist is quite convincing. Characters performances are more than adequate and the atmosphere, cinematography and pace distinguish this production from the average overrated pandering sequels of these days. What is somewhat lacking, is the handling of the inner trauma of one of the side characters. Never truly developed, nothing that really makes you care about it. It feels like a plot device. Like the somewhat perjury-worthy loyalty displayed near the end by yet another side character. Nothing earth-shattering, just nitpicking material. The movie is overall quite enjoyable.",Miss Sloane

This is not a propaganda piece, but given how polarized and divided the country is right now, there are now some who would see a political agenda in Jaws. Chastain gives a brilliant performance as the overachiever who is great at what she does, but seems to lack any moral compass.

125,slydon13,Movies staring women are not promoted,9,25 January 2017,"This is the first big movie about lobbiests I've come across. Jessica Chastain plays a tough part but unfortunately her personality isn't examined in depth during the 2 hours. The film explores the ways men are treated differently from women. For example she hires a male escort and while men would overlook this in a male lobbyist ('cos it would be far from the worst thing they do), for a woman it would end her socially. The escort is the perfect combination of sleazy and possibly entertaining.I don't imagine the notion that background checks before the purchase of a firearm is a seriously debatable point and so the film doesn't get into some pointless debate. Perhaps the proposed 'Registry of Muslims' is to allow crazy WASP's buy a surface to air missile but prevent sane Muslims from buying a 22.This movie was under promoted, like most films staring women. If you look at the posters for 'Arrival' you'll see that the female star got the same billing as her male co-stars who have a fraction of the lines.This was a movie about a strong woman, not unwilling to be disliked by men. Its funny at the start when the NRA man who thinks women are best spending time in the kitchen, is nervous about meeting her. He doesn't know if he should shake hands with a woman in the business world.Political movies where good triumphs (such as 'The Ides of March') didn't don't get much support despite the great cast and script. Instead tragic films like the new 'King Kong' or the recently lame 'Jurassic Park'offering are the only things in the cinema.My totally biased opinion is that some stupid men (like the committee Ms Chastain refers to) make choices about movies. They make testosterone fueled choices and go for expensive pointless non- scripts like 'Gods of Egypt' instead of low budget films that have a genuine script.Obviously - I'm with Her!",Miss Sloane

129,mark-durfor,Miss Sloane is the Best Chess Match Ever,8,7 December 2016,"Miss Sloane is a political thriller about Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain), a political strategist who is recruited to tackle the issue of gun control in America. She is notoriously ruthless, highly successful and will do whatever it takes to win for her side of the campaign, possibly risking her career and those closest to her with a win-at-all-costs mentality. A new proposed legislation requiring stricter background checks for gun ownership in the United States is gaining traction in Congress and Sloane is tasked with spearheading the campaign against her toughest opponent.After the recent Presidential election and the ongoing issues of gun violence and gun control in America, this movie couldn't come at a more perfect time. ""Lobbying is about anticipating your opponents' moves and launching countermeasures before they can act. It's about surprising them and making sure they don't surprise you."" Miss Sloane begins with political strategist Sloane sharing this insight into what it takes to win in politics with her firm's attorney as she is being prepped to take the stand on trial at a Congressional hearing. While nothing is more important that winning, Sloane gets caught up in the cause of gun control and states that this issue is more important than her career, after being warned about the consequences of her questionable actions. John Madden directed Miss Sloane and he is a seasoned professional having tackled such films as Shakespeare in Love (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing), The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and Mrs. Brown. He has directed 3 Academy nominated actresses in his career. However, this is writer Jonathan Perera's first writing credit in his career. After watching Miss Sloane, I don't think this will be the last we hear of him. He wove together a series of intricate twists and turns like watching an intense chess match leading up to the final ten minutes that had audiences literally cheering as the full scope of Sloane's game plan was finally revealed and we realize the chess game was won before the match even started.Chastain is joined by a couple heavy-hitters in John Lithgow and Sam Waterston in what was an upsetting, emotionally-charged, fierce look into the working of our political system and what it takes to make or kill legislation in the United States. While no action drives the movie, this 132 minute drama had the potential to drag at times. However, every scene had a point and a purpose that was never left unanswered and it didn't feel like it ran over 2 hours. Chastain could be up for another Oscar nomination for her performance of the ruthless, insomniac, fierce, lonely, brilliant political strategist. I originally gave Miss Sloane a 3.5 star prediction thinking it looked like it would be worth the money in the theatres, a movie I'd watch again, and give consideration to adding it to my personal collection. I agree with all of that, and the last 10 minutes of ""A-ha"" moments made me raise it up to a solid 4 Stars for Miss Sloane.",Miss Sloane

The film moves at a pace where the dialogue tries to grip you after dialogue with very rapid editing. Everyone's acting game is on top. Jessica Chastain delivers a great performance as always. She was able to turn her likable presence into someone incredibly unlikable. This film has nothing to do with propaganda. It is simply a story that presents how power corrupts the system.

Jessica Chasten gives a truly outstanding performance and an Oscar nomination for it should be in her future. The supporting cast is universally excellent. Since the movie is about congressional legislation for background checks on gun purchases, many of the Second Amendment fanatics (some of whom had not seen the movie but voted) gave it a 1. Ignoring those votes (257 of the 788) the IMDb rating would have been 7.5 which is an appropriate average. The movie is long, over two hours, which may be a detriment to some, but we certainly felt it was worth the time. I would like to commend supporting actors Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha- Raw (of Belle fame), and Alison Pill for their performances. I hope you will go to see this movie.",Miss Sloane
133,darryl-42069,An absolute surprise,8,8 April 2017,"I had to say, this movie came out of nowhere in my local cinema today (April 8). I personally wanted to watch this movie rather than Dreamworks's The Boss Baby simply because of the tagline.And boy it delivers.Jessica Chastain plays the title character: a lobbyists who is also a paranoid. She follows an act to against the gun lobby proposed by a senator, backed by her former firm. I have to say, I initially regretted from watching this movie. I even take a break from watching it and go straight to the toilet to wash my tired face, while at the same time asking myself: ""What the heck am I watching right now?"" or ""What brings me into this boredom?"" But I decided to return to the theater and... guess what? I was satisfied in the end, with a big grin on my face.First of all, this is not a political propaganda movie. This is a well constructed political thriller with clever writing, amazing performances and great soundtrack, which happens to use gun policy as a main inspiration. All the cast members deliver a wonderful performance, but it's Jessica Chastain and Mark Strong that really got me. The dialogue in the movie is smart, very rare to be seen in movie these days. The cinematography is amazing, and the editing is one of the best I've seen. The movie cuts between flashbacks and present day, but they didn't disturb the pace, instead it helps progressing the story without it became an annoyance. There were a lot of complex terms that average moviegoer wouldn't understand, but it's forgivable for a movie like this. The movie may also bore average moviegoer for being so slow at the beginning, but it's okay for me. The biggest part for making the movie so satisfying is the plot twist that I've never seen it coming. Just when think it goes this way, the movie makes an unexpected move and goes to a way that you won't expect. And for those who sticking around from the beginning till the end, you will be rewarded with a very satisfying ending. One more thing is that the movie's focus isn't about gun policy, but the corruption that lies within the government. It's the power- hungry officials that drove Sloane into using abnormal ways, to the point where she breaks the rules of the government to reveal the crimes of the government itself. This movie somehow reflects the reality of the governments in present day nations, which is another plus for this underrated masterpiece.I initially gave this movie a 7 for despite the movie being clever, the slow first act and the lack of Sloane's backstory is a letdown to me. But I give it an 8, just because the mind blowing TWIST. Easily to say, this is a movie that you definitely regret to watch at first, but later, when you're leaving the theater, you will definitely feel satisfied. Don't watch this movie if you already had a thought that this movie is a propaganda. Watch this movie, with an open mind, and you'll be rewarded by it.Well played, Miss Sloane. Very well played.",Miss Sloane
134,gtyoshida,A Political Thriller...Almost,7,2 August 2017,"Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a charismatic woman who lives by two simple rules...always plot one step ahead of the opponent and only play the final trump card after the opponent has played theirs. She attracts and keeps young talent like Jane Molloy (Alison Pill), a bookish protegee, and Esme Manucharian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a damaged gun violence survivor, by freely sharing her wealth of insider knowledge and hard ball politics commonplace in the lobbying arena of Washington D.C. She walks convincingly towards her non-existent parked car in order to time manage a conversation with Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), president of a small legal practice leading the fight against the powerful gun lobby to enact the Heaton-Harris Amendment which would require background checks on all gun buyers but whom she's mistaken for a Washington Post reporter. She climbs on board as his lobbyist and executes a brilliant plan to pressure an uncommitted congressman to voice his support for the anti-gun legislation in front of a room full of supporters and a cameraman covering the event. In so doing, she betrays the colleague she planted in the audience and hires an actor to pin down the congressman with a controversial question then explains her matter of fact change of plans came about because she anticipated her old boss and Gun Lobby president, George Dupont (Sam Waterson) vetting the audience, learning the real identity of her colleague, and ordering the congressman to avoid her question. Powerful moments like this occur throughout the movie thanks to director John Madden and writer Jonathan Perera not only to convey Elizabeth's formidable mindset but also to fan the audience's credulity so that when she plays her final trump card, the stunning blow is accepted without question.Elizabeth has close, genuine relationships with Jane, Esme, and Rodolfo. She even takes a protective interest in Forde (Jake Lacey), a male prostitute from the agency she frequents although his over the top sleaziness precludes any real romantic involvement. But the choice to cast John Lithgow (""Third Rock from the Sun"", ""Trial and Error"") as the corrupt Congressman Ron M. Sperling debases the film's worth as a political thriller. ""Miss Sloane"" is the story about a true leader and mentor, a woman who ends up in prison and emerges looking for another grand challenge. It is commendable but only rates seven out of ten.",Miss Sloane

It is difficult to write a deserving review of a film with this many surprises without spoiling it's structures for those who have yet to see it, but I think I can safely say that it delivers completely as far as what you would expect.

138,moveebuff1953,Politics exposed,8,24 July 2017,The cast of superb actors first drew me to this story. Jessica Chastain delivers a brilliant performance as a ball busting strong woman who makes no excuses for her desire to win at all costs. She can handle criticism as well as she hands it out. There is no room for personal relationships when the only option is to win. I've long believed that the average American citizen really doesn't hold any weight when it comes to strong issues like gun control. It is owned by the NRA who back the members of congress by donating millions to the right campaign. The gun lobbyist rule the gov't. Why is this so important? I think it's because weapon manufacturers are so wealthy that there is not a more powerful lobby group that can ever change any laws no matter how many innocent people are killed. It's all about the money. Nothing else really matters. John Lithgow & Sam Waterson once again prove their power in their performances. E Christine Baranski shines in her 2 minute cameo appearance. There's no doubt that movies like this one should be watched by all Americans but won't. Once an American chooses his/her political side..that party can do no wrong in their eyes. Politics is similar to religion...born into a mindset & brainwashed to believe that it is the only way that is right. The minions (civilians) are patted on their heads for voting the right way as the smiling senators live a life of luxury that few of their voters could ever dream of living. Until people educate themselves on how the system really works to benefit the rich it will never change. The rich are getting richer on the backs on the poor civilians. The joke is that they don't even know how they are being used to line the pockets of the corrupt.,Miss Sloane

Alternatively if you really enjoyed The West Wing then this movie is probably for you but here are my criticisms of it.Jessica Chastain's character is supposed to be good at her job yet in every single scene and every line of dialogue she comes across as a student union yahoo. It isn't just the hard right who have their collection of braying idiots and here is a prime example.This whole movie is like watching an alternative version of reality where a person isn't immediately fired for insulting a client and I don't just mean doing so in a Don Draper sort of way but by literally laughing in their faces and then offering to work with them.

Within the first 10 minutes she says ""Any psychopath can buy an assault rifle at a gun show or on the internet in less than an hour without a background check or even having to show an ID""This is absolutely wrong, even in the reddest of the red states, and it ruined the whole rest of the film. Her characters credibility flew right out of the window before 15 minutes had passed.

A sexy woman in high heels who looks after her appearance and looks sweet and pliable while she's nothing more than a cruel and evil human being more than capable of crushing decent folks with no empathy or real humanity. The characters are given perfect development and space. The bad: the typical predictable turns and twists. The typical predictable Hollywood view of how studios need to comment on political life in the USA with a beautiful lie that all is well that ends well. The script left a lot to be desired, the rapid fire dialog was unrealistic and got annoying, the actors and actresses were delivering their parts as if they were in an informational selling juicers that can juice wood; nobody is going to believe us so let's all exaggerate and hype it up. Apart from Gugu Raw and Mark Strong whose quiet, effortless and natural delivery was a breath of fresh air, everyone else was too loud, too over the top and generally REALLY annoying.

145,essentialmedia-46547,REVIEW BY A REAL LOBBYIST,2,6 November 2019,"The script is very self indulgent, as you would expect from left-wing Hollywood producers of every stature.As a lobbyist, there were piles of moments where the Direction failed or was overlooked. Telegraphed dialogue mostly in act 1 - pregnant pauses, unnecessary ego - most story-telling lobbyists are warm and smooth, not abrasive, that's why they are hired.I've seen an interview by the writer in which he claims to be a News junkie, obviously lacking in real life experience, but for most viewers that are pushing a gun ban agenda the film would still be entertaining.The key reveal is movie fabrication, a Senator who has worked years in the machinery knows better than to meet in that manner. More simply it would be easy to find a willing Senator to run a committee to bring down an offside unethical staffer.It also fails in it's very premise whether you are pro or anti gun - the guardians of the 2nd Amendment would never kneel because of a single indiscretion of a Senator trying to hold onto power.In conclusion Studios and smaller production houses are sidelining themselves from Billions of cinema dollars for not catering to all the fly over States that the acting fraternity wish didn't exist.There will be a correction, this is the history of all cultural movements. Still this film is good infotainment for Democrat voters and other lay voters without a vested interest.",Miss Sloane
146,robbieclaravall,Miss Sloane is one of the best overlooked films of 2016.,9,16 May 2017,"Miss Sloane deals with the world of politics and corruption, where stakes are high and money is more important than anything else in the world. Elizabeth Sloane, a formidable lobbyist in D.C. mainly known for her cunning work and successful track record, has been sought after for the Heaton-Harris Bill which revolves around the gun-control legislation. Once she accepts the role, she finds out that she may be against the most powerful opponent of her career, realizing that winning may not come as easy as it seems.Everyone who talks about this film seems to focus on two highlights: the gun control legislation, and Jessica Chastain. I'll start with the latter. Chastain's performance is indeed nuclear, and sadly not addressed by the Academy for at least a nomination. She has plenty of dialogue, and she delivers it with enticing confidence that marks her as a strong female character, in spite of some of her actions throughout the film. This is strengthened by the fantastic screenplay; some of the political jargon did go over my head, but most of what I understood were written well with such snarky wittiness that it's hard not to laugh at parts. This being said, the rest of the cast wasn't bad at all. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Alison Pill were stellar supporting characters, but I wanted to see more from the male side of the cast. This may be a feminist film, with female characters delivering some of the best sentiments, but it would've been better to get a little mix of both.On top of the great performances, there is a worthy plot beneath. This film gives the viewers a fascinating insight into the world of politics, not only tackling the issue of guns in the US, but also with how laws are passed through in the government. This film made me more interested in lobbyists than any other film I've seen with the same role. Furthermore, I love how grey the film deals with the gun control debate. It does not treat guns as neither fully beneficial nor bad, but it looks into the topic with both sides, seeing as how politicians today mainly argue on the pro-gun side of the debate (to only usually appease their viewers to garner more votes). This is a film that mirrors modern society by its issues as well as being a great contrast strengthened by feminism, a strong heroine, and a stellar supporting cast of characters. It can also be seen as a cautionary tale of what's to come, events of the plot eerily imitating what's happening in real life, maybe only with a bit more of unexpected drama.Miss Sloane is terribly one of the best overlooked films of 2016. Jessica Chastain as a lobbyist is electric, her performance magnetic enough to be ceaselessly entertaining, in spite of her dipping in and out of the banal reality of politics at times. It is a very relevant political thriller, and it's sad to see this under-perform at the box office because of the controversial election period this was released in and the poor marketing it has garnered throughout the US. People criticize it since it is openly against gun control, but they might not have watched it because Miss Sloane really is all about the rotten politicians running the Senate today. The gun control debate is just a subplot, the film itself tackling much needed political issues that other films are afraid to venture into. This film has guts. Jessica Chastain has guts. I highly admire them for it.",Miss Sloane

Acting and character building is one of the best I have seen in a long time. If you are the type of user who likes brainless action disguised in seemingly ""serious politics and FBI troubles"" than this movie is not for you - it is for serious viewers who understand politics and know how constitution works. This would also explain why this movie has a lower rating than it should - simply because it is not for an average user that likes movies like ""Allied"" or ""Manchurian Candidate"" or TV shows like ""Blacklist"". If you want an intelligent depiction and struggle of fighting against big corporation - it is a must watch!

151,aj1218,"A French Film Studio, with a first time British screen writer, makes a film about American Lobbying and gun control",4,13 December 2016,"Before we go any further, I am a veteran, a gun owner, with a minor in film and a theater background, and I keep an open mind when I watch movies. I actually saw the movie and I will keep politics aside but as you can tell from other reviews a lot of people are just down voting or up voting this movie based on politics. My score and critique are primarily focused on the screenwriter and director. These two factors I feel sunk the movie. This is the Jonathan Perera's first screenplay and while a valiant attempt he wrote something in one of the hardest genres, about a culture that isn't his, dealing with an issue he doesn't understand. And the director who I loved in The Best Marigold Hotel has many of the same issues, not understanding the American landscape. It is like Mel Gibson doing Braveheart, it isn't accurate at all however the difference is that Braveheart wasn't being shown to William Wallace. What made me want to see this movie is that it is a French company (EuropaCorp) with a British director and Screenwriter (John Madden and Jonathan Perera), a Dutch Cinematographer (Sebastion Blankov), about a controversial American industry (American Lobbying) that deals almost exclusively with a controversial American topic (gun control). It is almost a perfect storm of bad ideas and misconceptions, and it kind of is that. The one saving grace is that Jessica Chastain, who plays the lead, gives a great performance but it can't save this movie. The movie is meant to be an American Political Thriller that examines the corrupt world of Washington politics with a meaning message, but everyone involved is such an outsider to that world that it is greatly flawed, in both its depiction of D.C., lobbying, and American gun culture. The movie starts with Ms. Sloane being a powerful lobbyist in D.C. working for a right wing lobbying group. However for ""reasons"" when her boss asks her to start lobbying for a gun's rights, one of the most well-funded American Lobbying groups, she says no and immediately jumps ship and takes her entire team minus one member to a ""rag tag"" group. This is in the beginning of the film, and here is the fundamental issue. It comically misunderstands the issues and motivations of lobbyists in D.C, American Conservatives, and even American law. Besides the many non-competition clauses you sign when join a powerful D.C. lobby group, besides the gun lobby being portrayed in a comical fashion, what really hampers the movie is motivations of the characters especially the lead Ms. Sloan. She isn't an idealist or an activist. She isn't in it solely for the money. She just wants to win, but if that is the case you still question most of her decisions. But the moment you start getting into the movie, another terrible side character ruins it, or a terrible understanding of American politics ruins it, or a shoehorned in message about guns (really this is a very minor part of the movie seeing the ads and reviews you would think it was just about that). The movie does have a few tropes, such as the ""Court Room Moment"" that plays like the 15th season of law order as opposed to ""A few good men"". The movie is just lacking. The movie has a few good scenes but it is destroyed by inaccuracies and a lack of character depth. This movie has so much potential with this lead, but she can't save the sinking ship, and the marketing for it was just a huge risk that upset a lot of people, but that is what happens when a large team of outsiders only know America from online and media portrayals of us. See it only if you are a fan of Jessica Chastain. Otherwise go see Moana, or Rouge One, yeah they are Disney, but at least the motivations of the characters has more depth.",Miss Sloane

The perfect blending of present time and flash backs never got into annoying mode, in fact those were so timely that I felt I almost expected that piece of story from that point of time. The characterization of Miss Sloane by Jessica Chastain is so believable that we drift with the unpredictability of the character who is also so determined to get what she aims for. What I missed a little, may be a touch of her childhood, what made her what she is today. The writer , director anticipated this and played with a different angle, so in the story also she keeps on telling others why does she need to have a sad story to support for a cause is also believable. Mark Strong and other actors did justice to their characters, so did the script writer and the director.

Gun control is just the backdrop for the real story.It's also a character study of the main character, Miss Sloane. This part is handled really well, and the acting of Jessica Chastain really drives it home. There are two big teases here... First, that there really is no momentous event in Miss Sloane's life that makes her so adamant about getting the bill passed. Second, that we never do get to find out what makes her the way that she is, which can best be described as ""a morally positive anti-social."" Perhaps she's a high-functioning autistic with an overactive conscience?The only thing that brings the story down (just a bit) is the rather amateurish dialogue. In many scenes, the conversation seems almost adolescent. The twist at the end is nice, but most folks will probably guess how the story ends less than halfway through the movie.",Miss Sloane

She is lobbyist living in D.C. working for a large firm but has a unfriendly fallout and joins another firm to lobby against the 2nd amendment. She gathers some team members from her earlier firm and in Esme she finds someone who would come to play a crucial role later. We also get a look into Miss Sloane's personal life and what's the reason behind Miss Sloane's 18 hour workdays and insomnia.Once we gets over the initial slump, there's a turning point after which the film really picks up the pace for a thrilling finish although it comes a tad too late to save the movie.Jessica Chastain is a strong actress and the later half really drives home the point but the first half doesn't highlight it.

She signs off on the illegal state visit to Indonesia and she is using illegal surveillance against not only her opponents, but also her team. The other side of the table, so to speak, only uses the traditional political strong-arming to gain support and even the conversation between Dupont and the Senator is unprofessional rather than illegal - he presents evidence that Sloane has been involved in unethical practices and should therefore be investigated, and threatens the Senator into running a formal line of inquiry. For all the talk of moral high ground we are force fed by the pro-gun control side in this film (regardless of which side of the debate you're on, it's hard to ignore the blatant agenda), it is ironic that Miss Sloane herself is the most corrupt character.Putting this aside, the film is a quality production - the cinematography is great, the story is good and Jessica Chastain does a fantastic job in the main role.

The acting is beyond great, the technical aspects mastered (even if my personal taste has an issue with the OST), you really feel sucked into the story. Chastain portrays what many reviewers have described as an unlikable character, which destroyed the movie's appeal for those very same reviewers, supposedly bummed to see a beautiful Hollywood star portray a sociopath or at the very least not a nice person. Oh my... All those reviews about Taxi Driver sucking so hard because the main character wasn't nice, and let's not forget about Citizen Kane! Sigh...The real issue with the movie though, is that beyond the fact that it needs a perfectly acceptable suspension of belief in key moments, it kind of shoots itself in the foot :The movie kind of bombed on the box office, and it's hard not to see why, since it was mostly distributed in the US. But how hard was that to predict when it actually tackles gun control - in the most rational way - but lets the righteous side win the war? In reality, the gun lobby is winning, and we get a fiction happy end, which serves no purpose but reinforce both sides in their own set of belief. If despite all the good will, efforts and moral justification, the pro gun control side didn't win, the message would probably be much more effective, but admittedly a downer.So the movie is indeed highly entertaining, as a piece of Hollywood thrill, because in the end, that's all it is. If it really intended to serve the cause of gun control, it would need to take darker turns, at least in my opinion.But I won't lie, I was entertained and thrilled, it's just not close to as political as the producers wished you to believe it was.",Miss Sloane

That said, I'm not going shrivel.up and die because a film highlights and showcases the antigun side society as protagonistic. I love debating antigunners, whether they are neighbors, randoms, or politicians.Where I draw the line is when the left stops debating and starts outright LYING. That is why this movie bombed. Because the vast majority of Americans are gun owners, who understand things like the NFA, GCA, FOPA, 86 Hughes, FFL's, 4473's, NICS, all the crap we have to live under just to buy a legal firearm.So when the movie in the first 15 minutes spews the FALSE GARBAGE that ""anybody can buy an assault rifle with no ID"" well that's gonna be it for many many people.

167,jonathan-harris17,Grandstanding,5,22 January 2018,"Sharp-tongued political thriller, that's not quite as sharp or thrilling as it thinks, and very baggy around the edges.The focus of the plot is Washington lobbying, gun control and the general moral bankruptcy surround lobbying in general. The latter played up somewhere between a barking, permanently angry Sam Waterson (is there any other kind) and the ever-brilliant steel-faced Jessica Chastain.The subject of gun lobbying and the US 2nd Amendment is something so mired in unsolvable rhetoric I'll admit it gave the script a dull edge for me from the outset.The script allows for a lot of grand-standing and melodrama around every corner, the lobbying-team band-and-forth know-it-all banter a little old-hat at this point and very much sub-Sorkin. It's also not particularly believable.The only really interesting part of the film for me was Chastain, sticking to her steely resolve while finding new moral depths -- but a few times in the (rather lengthy) running time reveals that she might be human after all, in some well-played scenes in the latter third of the film.The denouement is so ridiculously over-the-top, in pure Hollywood style, that it did bring a measure of humour for me to a film otherwise lacking any.",Miss Sloane

173,lesliecolejr,'Miss Sloane' Stands Alone,7,12 December 2016,"Government affairs, sexual liaisons, ethical violations and cyber-roaches all convene atop Capitol Hill in ""Miss Sloane."" When Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is recruited by a firm to champion a congressional bill expanding background checks for gun purchases, she makes the difficult decision to leave her current lobbying position at a firm which opposes the bill. In doing so, she causes a split between those lobbyists loyal to her and those whose sympathies lie with the group committed to killing the bill. In her attempt to sway senators to vote for the bill, she must weigh the cost of her personal conviction with the consequences of doing whatever it will take to be successful.Jessica Chastain gives a forceful performance as Miss Sloane, the rock- hard lobbyist with a winner-take-all attitude. She succeeds in making a character that compulsively deceives, betrays, and crosses the line appear desirable, despite putting the lives of others in danger. Gugu Mbatha-Raw's character, Esme Manucharian, is sobering, reminding Elizabeth Sloane of the pitfalls of valuing ambition over personal relationships.",Miss Sloane

In Miss Sloane you have another film with beautiful faces, choppy dialogue, crisp banter back and froth, and unrealistic timely deliveries. None of which is the real world. I've seen board rooms and high-stakes meetings at a smaller level; albeit small organization board rooms and non-profit board rooms, none of them had a room full of everyone around the same age. Also absolutely none had no one above the age of 50! These movies can be made without being so far away from reality and still be beautiful to look at and interesting to listen to. The crisp and timely dialogue comes off as memorized speech - which it is; but, which it should not sound like. No one delivers words this way. Movies can reflect the real world and still deliver a script that audiences want to hear! The dialogue is too sharp and perfect. The cast is too young and the lead character's performance is way over the top.",Miss Sloane

179,transcendingpictures,Incredible. One of the best films of the year.,10,28 November 2016,"MISS SLOANE is not to be missed. It's an easy target for unmerited scrutiny by people who've never even seen it or have pre-conceived notions about the subject matter - it's clear from some of the user comments and internet chatter that there's just a lot of fanatical, closed-minded, easily-threatened people who hear the movie deals with gun control and they jump to the conclusion that it's liberal propaganda. Well, it does take a position - but a rational and cogent one, and it doesn't even try to push any kind of agenda - aside for perhaps asserting the politic system in Washington is rotten and driven by self-interest (but who's gonna argue with that, right?). And it's really not about the issue of gun control itself, that's merely the device in which its able to pull back the curtain on the lobbying industry in DC and show the machinations in which bills and laws are passed.The story clearly sets out pit an ambitious female lobbyist up against a formidable adversary - and the gun lobby has proved to be the most powerful representative group in DC, given that most citizens - and most members of the NRA - are in favor of stricter (and reasonable) background checks, but absolutely no progress has been made on this issue. That makes for a compelling background to analyze how the process of pushing a lobbying issue works within the system. It's not a threatening film to lawful gun owners - it may be to people who purchase guns with sketchy backgrounds and nefarious intentions ... but shouldn't every law-abiding citizen welcome that kind of oversight and protection so that they are the ones with guns and the people who may try to hurt them and their families are not?? Anyway, this film is clearly intending to be more of a character study of a troubled female lobbyist at the end of her rope in a career that's consumed her life, portrayed with steely brilliance by Jessica Chastain. It's also a riveting, intelligent, and surprising political thriller - the pace of the story is incredible, and it keeps the viewers on their toes from start to finish, never quite unfolding the way you'd expect, which ends up being even more satisfying and original.I'd liken the film more to Michael Clayton or A Few Good Men. It's got some of the best writing I've seen all year, on a plot level, dialogue level, character level, and the emotion running through the film sneaks up on you by the end, which is accompanied by one of the best twists I've seen in a movie in years. It's entirely earned and when you watch it a second time (I've seen it twice), the writer and director did a fantastic job planting all the seeds that make the ending really work. There's plenty of little details and breadcrumbs throughout - and since it's a film for smart, attentive viewers, it leaves that room for the viewer to discover many things along the way.If you're a fan of sophisticated, intelligent dramatic thrillers, MISS SLOANE is one of the best in many years. It won't be for everyone - low IQ folks will intimated by it, hardcore 2nd Amendment advocates will be threatened by it (even though it isn't passing any rhetoric that infringes anyone's rights to keep and bear arms), and I'd imagine sexists won't go for it either, because they won't want to see a smart, over-prepared, hard-edged woman one-upping a bunch of old white men. But, if all biases and prejudices are left aside, I think it's undeniable to enjoy how masterfully conceived, told, and performed this film truly is. Bravo to everyone who had the temerity to take on this subject matter, and do so with such incredible skill and care.And I think it's worthy of Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Chastain), Supporting Actress (Mbatha-Raw), Original Screenplay, Music, Editing, and Costume Design. And I'd consider it a front-runner for Chastain and the screenplay in that race, if judged entirely on its merits.10/10",Miss Sloane

We were all directed into confusion just like Miss Sloane's opponents. Genius move. It is all about putting the puzzles together until you realize Miss Sloane has also managed to surprise us.The story began, rather confusingly, into a court case which Miss Sloane was tied into. Flashback to the story prior to the case, Miss Sloane was lobbying for a motion which seems to have nothing to do with the subject of the court case. The script seemed to intentionally make up all these jargon that made the topic difficult to understand. Eventually the pieces started to fit together and all the political debate made sense.Jessica Chastain, again, delivered a strong performance portraying a powerful female protagonist. All the other actors also made formidable performance as supporting characters.The cat and mouse storytelling started off slightly shaky, at times feeling too scripted but managed to make a powerful comeback.

But that is forgotten as the story evolves and we learn more about the hard- shelled person Miss Sloane is but yet so vulnerable and alone. But as she grew, the story became more sufficient and exciting. What we learn from the character is the thin line between professional outcome and your fellow man – how far can one go without trespassing? It's an insight of the work behind the scenes of the political world. Miss Sloane does everything to win, ordering surveillance of her coworkers and opponents – unlawful, but yet determined. She is well prepared and that is what makes the subliminal message in this film more convincing. It's also very surprising with unexpected events with a clever and great script.

The advocates for gun reform and background checks vs the gun lobbyists were merely the format for showing what a rigorous process it is to get bills passed in Congress, the price you have to pay for it and how broken our entire system is ... that most people are unaware of. It even left out the most important fact that 70% of Americans want stronger background checks to purchase a gun, so it really wasn't a pro or con movie.It's obvious that those one star reviewers, who only talked about the movie in terms of liberal and Republican or the left and the right, never saw the movie and only wanted to discourage people from seeing it. I've seen literature from the right that tells people to go to movie and book review sites and down vote any of them that appear to have a liberal bias. They're told that they don't even have to watch the movies or read the books. Just bash them if they sound liberal. I'm not taking sides here, just showing how one side works. After looking at the one star rating reviews, I gave the movie an extra star to offset their obvious political agenda driven star ratings. They had nothing to say about the actual movie.There isn't any way, after watching the movie, that you'd think one star is all it deserves. There wasn't one second when the movie drags or that you would want to miss...unless you have no interest in politics at all (a serious problem in American culture) but in that case, you probably wouldn't go see it anyway. This was one of the few much better movies I've seen this year after being lured into so many that have nothing to say, are all computer flash and bang and are forgotten the next day.

How many of those haters have actually watched this movie?? This movie is so frustratingly underrated. It was even only screened in the US. Why is John Madden not nominated/awarded for his directing?This movie shows two sides: Pro and Contra of gun control. The movie is about lobbying and how some politicians (senators)can be lead by money and power without giving a damn about their country, the people, and their safety. Jessica Chastain gives a masterclass in acting. She is almost in every frame and totally owns every scene she is in. Her performance is again so powerful, thrilling and enigmatic. I really can't understand why she was not nominated for an Oscar, as she had so many lines to speak rapidly and fiercely. Her character does everything to win by eliminating every grain of morality and compassion. It is up to the viewer to find her likable or not. Or to relate to her. She is not one-dimensional and shows many layers of herself. I also loved ""The Debt"", again directed by Madden and starring Chastain. They are certainly a great duo. Mark Strong should also be mentioned, the great actor who seems to be cruelly underrated in every movie he is in. The question is, why? Not young, no six-pack, bald, not American?

This film gave me a glimpse of hope, Jessica Chastain was simply and with one word, extraordinary, At times while watching i felt an awe, an envy, as well as being inside the role myself, its like she felt it more than her real self, Mark Strong was his typical good actor self, solid and dynamic, as well as John Lithgow was, and all the other secondary rolesThe twists in this film gave me goosebumps, to the point that i felt a feeling of relief when the movie finished as the suspense was there till the very last second, to the point that i did not want the movie to finishTo conclude this was, if not, one of the best movies of 2016",Miss Sloane
205,atcallan,"Slow to start, but picks up the pace. Interesting story with good performances",7,29 January 2017,"It is clear from reading other reviews that this film has upset some of the NRA gun lobby people. Despite the narrative that runs through the film, about ""control"" not meaning, ""the lefties are coming to take your guns"". Clearly many of these people slating the movie have not even bothered to watch it. In my mind the film promotes common sense and suggests the petulant bickering of both sides to be nothing more than political jousting, rather than genuine concerns about rights or safety.The film itself has many positive performances, it is well shot, and despite a slow start. The story picks up pace to a superbly crafted ending. The leading lady is an intimidating hard faced lady, who will be attractive to some, but perhaps not to all. That said any movie where the leading character is not easily likable, can be refreshingly interesting.",Miss Sloane

207,thefrontporchpeople,"A Podcast Review by Hollywood Critics (Les Roberts, Ann Elder)",9,22 February 2017,"Our Hollywood critics, Ann Elder and Les Roberts, were very excited by this political thriller and thought that Jessica Chastain ""played this role to perfection."" This film is all about the law, but Miss Sloane is all about herself. She is a powerful lobbyist, and the director does a good job of walking the line between making you love and hate the protagonist. Les was afraid that this would be a film adaptation of the television series, ""Scandal,"" but he was relieved to see a refreshing character study. The supporting cast and direction of the film helped to reinforce the wonderful performance by Chastain. The only complaint or ""trigger"" warning they had, is that Sloane advocates for gun control, which might offend some people. They suggest that viewers overlook this, because this film really hits the target.

208,JinFL,Awesome Performance by Jessica Chastain in Brilliant Movie,10,2 July 2017,"Outstanding movie and brilliant performance by Jessica Chastain. It can be a little confusing at first and it's fast paced just as her character, Elizabeth Sloane is. Riveting portrayal of lobbying on Capitol Hill. A bit unfortunate that a gun control law is the focus, because that got NRA members to boycott, even if they knew little about the movie. Otherwise I think the box office total would have been much higher. Because it could have been any bill, the emphasis is on her and her commitment to win. Ms. Chastain is awesome. I truly believe she's up there with Meryl Streep in acting ability. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year.",Miss Sloane

212,greg-27-486698,Tough dramatic thriller...,8,13 December 2016,"Stellar performance by Jessica Chastain. John Lithgow adds the best supporting role. Many twists and turns that keep the viewer interested and engaged. Lots of beautiful and maybe no so beautiful people. It all comes together at the end. I didn't end up liking the character very much, but I admired her drive, cunning, confidence, and ruthless competitiveness. Miss Sloane is the prizefighter who refuses to go down, and leaves everything she's got in the ring. I'm not sure that Washington is as cutthroat as the movie makes it out to be, but few movies treat this subject as well. One thing is for sure - if I lived in that kind of world I'd want a Miss Sloane by my side! I'll put this on my list of movies I want to see again, which I rarely do.",Miss Sloane
213,mihirnanda,"Thrilling, gripping and mind-blowing!",10,11 December 2020,"I don't know how such a good movie is so underrated. Maybe because of the political statement that this gives. But from filmmaking point-of-view, this is definitely a good film. Unlike high-octane thrillers with so much action happening, this one is a very brainy and cerebral film where everything happens by planning, plotting and manipulating. This is based on a very different profession and you should watch yourself to understand this profession. If you've watched Zero Dark Thirty, you know how impactful Jessica Chastain is. Here, she is just flawless. Playing the titular character who's so eccentric and sociopathic just like Sherlock Holmes, she was amazing. About the story, it's based on US political and legal system so in the beginning it'll be a little difficult to understand but after 20-30 minutes into the film, we understand what's it all about and that's what I like about such films. Being here in India, we can learn so much about their system through such films. And the climax here is just mind-blowing. This is now one of my favourite climaxes, really.
If you like such films where there's so much planning and manipulation, you definitely should check this one out.

214,family-63052,9/10 score from me,9,30 December 2017,"Ms. Sloan is not exactly a model moral compass but her determination in urging and making ""gun control"" a success is exactly the right thing to do in a world where a lot of us are confused about what is right and what is not. If only gun freedom can stop the wrong usage of guns, Jesus would just use gun instead of preaching and being a perfect model to ""show them your left/ right cheek if they slap the other cheek."" If violence can end violence, Ghandhi, Mother Teressa, Buddha, Jesus, Mandela would have seek to restore peace, inner calmness and benefit to all using violence and war. They did not. The arguments of gun control has been on and on for years, things may be even more absurd when there is a president who seldom resort calmness and inner wisdom. While USA continues to earn money by exporting guns, weapons, how is it possible for USA to have less gun violence within its border? If I were to be rich, I will be rich no matter what occupation/ business I engage in. I don't have to sell weapons to make myself rich. Good weapon usage are far lower than people using weapons for wrong things. If peace and prosperity are built upon weapons, I would rather not go to heaven for I never want a heaven built upon violence, rage and brutality.",Miss Sloane

216,leotkonewton,"Top-notch, Hitchcockian thriller",7,16 December 2016,"Lots of one-star reviews, and all for the ridiculous reason that a small part of the film uses gun-control as a means of moving the script. The movie is really about exposing corruption in Washington, an issue that the Right should be on board with. Chastain is great, and the pace and plot make the movie seem much shorter than its actual run time. Again, you can safely ignore the one and two-star reviews, as those are just for two issues: 1) the film dared offer facts about gun crime, and 2) it had a woman in the title role as someone ten times smarter than everyone else. If it had been a man, somebody like Kevin Spacey from The Usual Suspects, then these Righties would have no problem. But a WOMAN being THAT smart? Please. And gun-control too? SO, please, ignore the one star reviews and give this thriller a shot.",Miss Sloane

Full of twists, the writing is clever, the performances are excellent and Jessica Chastain delivers what few Actors (as a general term) are still capable of - playing emotionless characters is hard but miss Chastain is on top of her game.The language can be tricky at some point, but the story itself is enough to make you understand where the action is taking you.I was on the edge until the very end.

220,thalassafischer,Almost Everything I Want in a Film,9,14 July 2017,"While Miss Sloane isn't absolutely flawless, it's excellent and underrated. The only reason I wouldn't give this ten out of ten stars is because in a couple of scenes the dialogue between characters is a bit too snappy and contrived, which I found distracting, and the audiovisual aesthetics could have stood mild improvement. Otherwise, the characters and story line are awesome.I love mysteries and thrillers, and knew I wanted to see Miss Sloane from limited previews when I had little idea what it was about. I also give kudos to the directors and producers for not giving away the entire film in the previews. Miss Sloane is a brilliant amoral strategist who sees people as chess pieces within political situations, who bends rules without necessarily breaking them. She cares very little for the niceties and conventions of society and manners, and cares only about principles and winning. Suddenly she develops a strong conviction about a political goal and applies her prior skill set to those ends.With exciting twists and the fantasy control of situations, like a female sort of ""James Bond,"" Miss Sloane almost plays out like an action film rather than a drama. The end is extremely satisfying and worth waiting for.Miss Sloane is about more than just the gun lobby. If you can't see the larger implications you're missing a very intelligent aspect of the film.",Miss Sloane

Supporting cast is uniformly first rate.The issue she lobbies for happens to be gun control, it could be anything and the plot would still move forward, in tact, with all the snappy dialog and chess like maneuvering just fascinating to watch and try to second guess.

However, as I was leaving the room, I believed I've seen, at least, an 8.0 rating-movie.The movie starts quite slowly building its plot, as we witness the professional life of Miss Sloane, a self-centered woman who totally neglects her personal life, aiming for ""greater goals"". We understand she is a complex human being, who uses all means necessary for a win at court.However, as the movie continues, we start to get really attracted to the plot, with some twists and tense moments.

Mark Strong is always good (he seriously deserves more recognition) the rest of the cast are frankly, irrelevant. Jon Lithgow deserves a mention for his portrayal of a bumbling senator falling just short of a full Dick Solomon.In short, the film thinks it's more clever than it is, it fails to surprise and is very predictable.

It's such a shame that so many potential customers have not been given a chance to see ""Miss Sloane"" in the Cinema.I rate this as perhaps Jessica Chastain's greatest performance.

She should have been nominated for this role for every award show...Miss Sloane is a great movie which has a very fast pace. You can't predict what's coming next, great performances by everyone on the cast.Forget about the bad reviews, even if you don't like politics this movie will keep you interested.

The movie picks ups hot topic but does not invite to debate, you get force-fed a certain viewpoint and it just falls flat. I had hoped for something much better but i was sorely disappointed, this could have been really good but you are forced to think the same way as the main character and that does not make the viewing pleasant. I would much more recommend that you watch a real debate on the topic where both views are presented by both sides, movies like this one will only get this ongoing debate stuck and we will never hear the end of it.",Miss Sloane

How didn't I hear about this movie?,10,31 July 2017,"Honestly, I've never heard about this movie and I'm just in the habit of watching whatever Amazon Prime happens to show as ""just added"".I like a good thriller and immediately enjoyed the pace of the dialog and the acting level of the actors forced to perform in a group and make conversation look natural.I also enjoyed that it was unapologetically intelligent. Great plot doing a difficult job of showing more than half the movie in the wrong order. Most of all, I liked that it showed what's it like when you're the genius-level chess player in the room. How odd it feels when people aren't thinking 4 or 5 or 6 steps ahead.Even as the main character proves to be unrelenting and immoral in her approach to winning, you're still rooting for her because Jessica Chastain does an excellent job of showing that she (the character Liz Sloane) does have some feeling regarding what she must do to be an effective lobbyist.)In short, an utter and complete surprise!

The note she receives in the beginning of the movie just after she exited the reception from Rodolfo Schmidt (Peterson Wyatt CEO) with his financial offer he is ready to pay if she leads the campaign against the gun lobby is exactly the same note her former assistant/now secret operative at Cole Kravitz & Waterman gives to her colleague/boss when resigning in one if the last scenes if the movie. It clearly is the same note stating that 'a conviction lobbyist can't only believe in her ability to win', on the back written ´for services rendered peterson Wyatt offers you $0'. She took the job for free because she was getting sick of defending causes not in line with her principles. She was desperate to prove herself she is more than just chasing a career founded on deception and lies, she has become ethical.

248,abhishek-bose,"Tight Screenplay, Sharp Acting - Must watch!",8,11 March 2017,"Anarchy is a compulsion to achieve a state of supremacy at all costs, but winners are not anarchists. They are smart disciples of life, as it is a game of existence that we play on a daily basis. This movie brings out this very fact in a beautifully bound script, talking of ethics and normalcy in life, all at the same time. The fact of the matter is that we are deluded in our thoughts and delusion always leads to a programmed destruction of our existence. In short, even if we do, we barely make it. Miss Elizabeth Sloan was just the opposite of such a way of life, but the surrealism of reality (If I can context such a possibility, without being incorrect) has her working in a light of normalcy we are all familiar with at all facets of life. The good part about this feature is that the angles of the sub-plots are layered and climactic in nature, which required great work in editing and direction. It was done just right in that perspective. There are abrupt flaws in continuum and characterization in very small quantities, but overall, the tendency to have a theme resolute in the final climax of a feature requires art and hardly we get it right. Spotlight, the movie, is one such example of linear execution of theme and idea. A craft which is mastered by very few in terms of screenplay and execution, but John Madden did it right. The only flaw I saw in the movie was the complex inclusion of sub-plots with a lot of information. This was a little difficult to follow, specially by viewers who are not well informed. John Madden has a surreal touch to his screenplay, in all his movies. I would say, he tried very hard to keep it as grounded as possible. The part I don't understand is that the story and screenplay were beautifully executed for cinematic excellence and there was a strong point being made.

254,septimus_millenicom,Jessica Chastain for President,10,11 December 2016,"Jessica Chastain is at her very best in _Miss Sloane_. She is at full throttle, 100-miles-per-hour, from the get go. The performance rivals her work in _The Tree of Life_ and _Miss Julie_, although those are very different films with very different protagonists. Perhaps the closest comparison would be Maya in _Zero Dark Thirty_, another win-at-all-cost workaholic. In interviews, Chastain revealed that she originally envisioned a poorly dressed, sleep-deprived obsessive lobbyist for the titular character Elizabeth Sloane -- kind of like her character in Bigelow's film. After doing research and meeting with real life Washington D.C. lobbyists, she radically revised her ideas, armoring Sloane in black power suits and matching nail polish. Instead of the emotional eternal graduate student in _Zero_, her Miss Sloane is a staggeringly powerful grown woman. She is brilliant, ambitious, and not above betraying her coworkers. Commanding without being loud most of the time, the actress brings astonishing nuances to bear (witness the 4-5 different ways she evokes the fifth amendment against self-incrimination, and the electric, montage-like sketches showing Sloane dazzling and schmoozing with her assets at fund-raising parties). The directorial and cinematography work by John Madden and Sebastian Blenkov, respectively, emphasize her larger than life stature. There are two wide-angle shots -- one at the airport when she regrets almost getting a coworker killed, the other at the end when she walks out of prison -- where the camera reveals just how small and fragile she can be without that titanic persona. (Chastain is barely 5'4"" after all.) The exceptions only underscore the rule: at most times she seems to be the only entity on screen.And yet Chastain will probably come away without even an Oscar nomination this year. The Oscars seldom reward career women (for Best Actress, the last 30 years have produced two detectives, in _Silence of the Lambs_ and _Fargo_) or rogues (_Monster_ and _Misery_). Actors are different of course. The sheer velocity and ferocity of her Sloane are technical marvels to pull off, but these don't please crowds; Holly Hunter didn't win for _Broadcast News_ either. Many award winning performances can be preening, self-congratulatory exercises. Nicole Kidman seemed to think that good acting equals speaking her lines *really* slowly in _The Hours_. That and a fake nose. The Academy voters apparently agreed! If I may indulge in a bit of hyperbole -- pick any random 20-minute chunk of _Miss Sloane_, and I'd wager that the sheer power and variety of Chastain's performance in those 20 minutes would obliterate many award-winning actresses' entire careers.Back to the rest of the film. Gugu Mbatha-Raw (who starred in _Belle_) is a cool, principled counter-eight to Sloane's fireball, while Alison Pill teams up with her ""Newsroom"" costar Sam Waterston as the opposition. The reviewers who claim the over-the-top ending is passe in this political climate must be jaded beyond words; political corruption is still punishable by imprisonment in this country. The excesses and sensationalism of the story's final act are easy to forgive because of the grace note at the very end. Elizabeth Sloane remains an enigma, the reason for the fanatical dedication to her cause never revealed. The film is much better this way without Christopher Nolan-style over-explaining.",Miss Sloane
255,airira-17370,A buried classic!,10,26 December 2018,"This movie got lost in the financial problems of its parent company, Europa, which is also Luc Besson's production company. That's why it never got a proper US release. Which is a great shame because it would have cleaned up at the Academy Awards. Best Actress, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Screenplay. It would have cleaned up. And Jessica Chastain's performance will be studied by acting students for a generation at least. She is magnificent as Miss Sloane. Mark Strong is excellent as her boss, Sam Waterson (Law and Order) does a great job as her lobbyist adversary.
I won't divulge the script except to say that the gun people have it wrong railing against the ""liberal Hollywood types"" making a case against gun ownership. First, it's only about mandatory background checks, nothing more. And second, it's a DAMN MOVIE. Calm down. They used guns as a plot point because it's dramatic. That's all. If it had been rice cakes that was the subject, nobody would watch it. Not that rice cakes aren't kind of dramatic but not enough to fund a movie over their sale and use. Can't hunt with a rice cake.
I'm not anti gun. I used to be but I lost my passion for it after Charlottesville. A world full of alt-right loonies and white supremacists, makes concealed carry mandatory.
But this movie isn't about Charlottesville or any other real life incident. Nevertheless it's brutally effective in making its point.

I have a feeling as to why it didn't do well at the box office, but pay no attention to the negative reviews and one way or the other leaning critics. I'm a believer that a good film is a good film, no matter the supposed ""agenda"". When you sit down to watch a movie, the filmmaker and the actors only have a couple of jobs, which can vary depending upon the genre. If it's a comedy, the only real job is to make you laugh. If it's action, they need to blow up stuff in as logical a way that can be conceived in an action film. And if it's a drama, as we have here, lead with great story telling and excellent performances. If they make you think at the same time, that's just icing on the cake. Miss Sloane is a drama that checks all of those boxes and qualifies as an amazing film.",Miss Sloane

280,gustinmichna,Great for the select few,7,12 April 2019,"Miss Sloane is a drama/ thriller about the character Madeline Elizabeth Sloane played by Jessica Chastain who plays a lobbyist in Washington D.C who is absolutely obsessed with winning. I've watched the movie many times but strictly for the plot not the story line. The movie Miss Sloane takes very strong political views on gun reform and exaggerates a lot of arguments on the issue. But on the other hand, Miss Slone is a very independent women who you can see has worked very hard to get where she was and that causes her to fear by basically everyone in Washington. The movies make her out to be the hero and villain who sees herself as a trump card for the greater good.
The plot in the movie is very entertaining to watch which is why I enjoyed the movie. Her quick comebacks and remarks make her stand out in this world which is obviously populated mostly by males. You see as Jessica Chastain's character fights for what she believes is right. Throughout the movie you can see her as very unpredictable. This women protagonist enjoys besting everyone to the punch and doesn't seem to ever lose. Even when her tactics are unethical and outrageous in her line of work that what she seems to need in order to win. Her ideas and executions are proof that she's perfect for politics and creates plans that could only be created in the mind of a women.
Storyline wise the movie isn't for everyone. If your have strong beliefs and ties into Gun reform politics, you will be bias on what happens in the movie. Miss Sloane shines a light on self-centered Politian's who have nothing to do better than destroy each other. Some might see the movie as a unrealistic way to portray all politicians who are not ""Lefties"". Ironically this movie was released in 2016 and you can't help to wonder if the movie was a satire to the election that same year.
I applauded the actors who created a world where you became immersed into the movie. Alison pill played in the movie as Jane Molloy is the underdog during the movie but comes out to be the trusted sidekick in the end taking everyone by surprise. No part of Miss Sloane was predictable and even after re watching the movie you see foreshow in earlier parts of the movie but it's never in a way that reveals the rest of the movie. For writer Jonathan Perera this was his first screenplay ever written by him, but the movie proves that he's had experience in the business. Versus the director John Madden whose best known for his movie Shakespeare in love in 1998 staring Gwyneth Paltrow. Rated R for language and some sexuality this movie is made for the select few who enjoy watching movies for fun.",Miss Sloane
281,seedickrun,Something for both sides of the aisle,8,19 November 2021,"In a politically charged world, it is rare to see a political movie that can be viewed so differently by conservatives and liberals.Liberals will cheer this movie as Moss Sloane is willing to do anything to win, and in the end, she does ""win"" her argument.Conservatives will cheer this movie as a perfect example of the ""ends don't justify the means"" as liberals are willing to do whatever they can to ""win"" their morale high ground arguments while leaving their own morality at the door.I think the director wanted to make a bigger point in this movie than he ultimately made. Some people see this as a ""corrupt politician"" movie. Some see this as a gun rights movie. I don't think it's either one.I think it's an indictment of humanity in general. As one side condemns the immoral and illegal actions of the other side, they are more than willing to ignore their own immorality and illegal actions along the way. The ending was too abrupt, but it was the powerful message than almost no one mentions in these forums. As Miss Sloane was released from prison, she is alone. Nobody meets her. Nobody picks her up.

Chastain has shown she's a talented leading lady in other roles with a great resume but Miss Sloane is her real star turn. Mark Strong leads a very able supporting cast but Chastain literally is the film. The staggering finale twist and gun control debate TV spot are two of the best scripted scenes ever. And it's Chastain's delivery that's simply perfect.Plenty of other actresses and actors may have done equally well with Jonathan Perera's wonderful words or John Madden's able direction.

Now that I have it it justified my admiration for Ms. Chastain, but demolished my expectations for the movie itself as it unfolded.Ms Chastain who solidly ""possesses"" her character from the opening scene, and manifests the sense of purpose, intelligence and indomitability that drives the drama, comes undone at the drop of a colleague's tear, the whisper of an associate's whimper, and transforms her, in spite of our amazement at her collapse, into an hypersensitive, guilt-ridden, hesitant apologetic woman in search of a comforter.

If this movie was about a different issue it would have a much higher rating.The sad thing is that the movie isn't even about gun control. It's about a character. If there is any political message being made its not about guns. It critiques the messed up system where votes are obtained not by the merit of the bill, but by political favors, money, and career advancement.I'm sure a lot of the negative reviews heard the words ""gun control"" and instantly decided to hate the movie.

Every second of her performance it is obvious that she is acting. I put it all on the director who in a juvenile manner presents a story that is so full of holes that within five minutes of the beginning one wants to vomit. Oh well, a wasted few dollars is not an earthquake. A story of immature thinkers who are opportunistic and immoral among opportunistic and immoral Senators and Representatives and the NRA. Ms. Chastain obviously is designed to be an imitation of the idiot clown trump - and lobbyists to be the vile reprehensible parasites that they are. Ms. Chastain's character supposedly is to be redeemed by her final act - hardly - it is just a middle school version of play-yard bullies among bullies.

However, I can't completely dismiss this piece of propaganda because it's undeniably well-made. Also, it accurately portrays many aspects of DC lobbying underbelly. Finally, Jessica Chastain is a tremendous actor, and her performance in this film is no exception.

The sub plot is delivered, a driving point that cuts deep. When a woman's desire to do whatever is required to deliver, her life is precariously out-of-balance, tap dancing a line between success and death.Be wary when a sphinx is challenged. Not all lobbyist are created equal. When Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain, a Hill top gun lobbyist is thwarted by the NRA, she takes push back into the realm of balls to the wall. A David vs. Goliath match ensues. Recast into DC street fight, where Sloane seemingly sacrifices whatever resources become available, leaving no rock 'unmourned' in a scorched Earth death match. What results is a twist you won't see coming. What's left is a resurrection, the proverbial phoenix rises from ash, decimated but born into a new existence. This is one movie you won't want to miss if you loved Argo or American Hustle!The acting is faultless. There are some great lines and moments that permit a deeper understanding although not completely transparent of Sloane's head space. Moments bounce between 'is she playing this person' to 'God, that's cold even for a cause.' One never truly knows where the motivation to stay such a harsh lonely course has evolved, but hey it's a driving point in a story you won't want to end. Not a spoiler but I will say, the last scene allows the viewer to imagine what might occur next...enough that you'll finish Miss Sloane or begin part 2 in your head.",Miss Sloane

Jessica Chastain killed it - amazing work - she carried the whole movie on her shoulders, and she be regarded highly for it.As for her character - very nicely done. there are many people who put their career before anything, and I don't think we have many women shown that way - though there are women highly married to their work. there were examples like Devil Wears Prada and such, but this is another angle, and knowing how hard female staffers on the hill work - I think this is great to see. her hiring an escort, also a good choice and point to make. I am not saying any of this to promote feminism nor am I woman, this just purely independent of that whole debate.people mentioning pro NRA reviews, who try to attack the movie. sorry - the movie is spot on, Washington is dirty and for sure, the NRA is. they can totally destroy people's careers and I have seen the dirty they pull first hand.",Miss Sloane

I know. anyway, it ended up on my top 10 favorite films, the plot is 8.5/10 the acting (Jessica's) is a 10/10!, the ending part is truly dope, I really don't understand how Jessica was not nominated for Oscar, like, damn, her acting was flawless.

310,nulsen-85186,Miss Sloane,8,10 December 2016,"I just wanted to see something different this weekend. Miss Sloane was a perfect reprieve from the animation domination, or the ""Casablanca"" wanna be's, or strange doctors, and crude Christmas movies. Jessica Chastain not only embodied and personified the character of Elizabeth Sloan, a self-driven, win at all costs, quick-witted, acerbic tongued, well-dressed lobbyist, but so embraced her, that I could never see her as anything but Miss Sloan. To me, this performance deserves more than a nod from the Oscars. It far exceeds anything I have seen to date from a female lead.This movie will deftly take you on a ride through the political maneuverings of lobbyists and their influence on the creation and failings of lawmaking in our nations capital. In this case, gun control. If you like political thrillers, this will definitely push your buttons emotionally, no matter what side you are on.You may love her or hate her, depending on what side of gun control you are on, or lobbyists in general; or you may feel the same way about her as a human being, because her personal life is no different than her corporate life, but no matter what, you won't forget her performance and the chance at redemption for her soul.Regardless of any factual errors in the script, I believe the intent was to show the divisiveness of the legislation and the extreme measures that both sides of any issue where big money is involved will go to; and the huge effect that lobbyists have influencing those measures. Although the supporting cast of Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Sam Waterston, John Lithgow, and everyone else, turned in meaningful and important performances, this movie belonged to Elizabeth Sloane. It is a powerful and important message that should definitely be seen.",Miss Sloane

That's what this movie is about, and I love it for it. I won't tell you the details, but it (deliberately) leaves two HUGE unanswered questions: #1.She's willing to go to prison to achieve her goal, but would she really engage in murder-for-hire to get what she wants? #2.What was her motivation for doing everything that she did?Her motivation is left completely in the dark, but alluded to, as the-woman-with-no-ties (vaguely) smiles at whoever is picking her up in the last scene.Like Memento, you either have to recreate it backwards in your head or see it again with those questions in mind.",Miss Sloane

I saw it last night and it is *not* about the gun lobby, although that's part of the story. In fact, the movie does a good job portraying both sides of the argument.About the movie. I liked it and thought it had depth and raised a lot of questions about power, greed, corruption, the weakness of some of our laws, means vs. ends, and the motivations of some of the country's movers and shakers and elected representatives. I plan to see it again. It also brings up the question about males vs. females in high power jobs. Men who act one way are called leaders, women who act that same way are called ice queens or something like that. For example, I'm sure there has been a lot of discomfort over her, er, sex life when I don't think audiences would have had the same discomfort if it had been a male lead.On the downside, I thought it was a bit ""over the top"" at times and I just didn't buy into some of the motivations or plotting, but what do I know about power politics in Washington?",Miss Sloane

Quite the opposite. I was kind of hoping she would be taken out by opposition.To those who say the subject matter of gun control was just the background for the drama of the lead character, I say uh uh. Not balanced.

I'm certain that the government will always treat me right and I would never need a gun because nobody bad can get through the security gates at my sub-division so why would anybody else need one? So any way I thought this would show the world how correct my viewpoint is but even I was confused.The first problem I had with the movie was that even though the NRA meanies were old white guy caricatures I thought they could have fleshed out those caricatures with aspects like making them more red-neck like, or maybe drive pickup trucks with gun racks and maybe be married to their sisters. I say if you are going to lie about your political opponent don't be half hearted about it but go full gusto like the fake news that is pumped out daily by the MSM good guys. The other thing that I didn't like about the movie was that there wasn't a gratuitous LGBQT sub-story that would energize us SJWsto to rally around so that we can show how more enlightened we are over the regular folks.

One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is unrivaled. The genius who designed the plot of this movie deserves a whole host of accolades for them personally. Twists and turns around every corner making it engaging on a level similar to that experienced when deconstructing a Shakespeare play. This movie is for anyone who desires not only a piece of quality entertainment but also something that stretches their intellect.

Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one, whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience watching it for an European audience, as from the start second amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however, although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even expect other side to be equally represented?

326,sarahsmith-69686,Anti-gun fairytale posing as a political thriller,1,6 December 2020,"No, the anti-gun sentiment isn't just a sub-plot, it's the entire purpose of the film.
Every character on the anti-gun side is good, noble, motivated by higher things than money.
Every character on the pro-gun side is immoral, self-serving and greedy.
The arguments for more gun-control where splashed liberally (pun intended) around throughout the film, but their opponents had no good arguments, their only recourse was to threaten senators with damage to their careers in order to persuade them to vote for the Heaton-Harris bill.
I live in the gun-free UK and I could put a better pro-gun case than anyone in this film.As for the scenes showing us politicians in the pockets of the NRA. From the evidence of the last four years, using legal process to fight political battles, strong-arming politicians with threats or straight-up bribing them, are much more the Democrats' style.The only good pro-gun argument voiced in the film was right at the start when Sanford talked about putting them in the hands of women and someone said ""God made men & women, and Samuel Colt made them equal"". But if you were tempted to give that serious consideration you were quickly told otherwise by Chastain laughing loudly and dismissing Sanford as a clueless old man. From that point I knew what side Madden and Perera were on and we were not going to get an interesting clash of ideas on the rights and wrongs of guns in the USA.

330,pyler-12979,Totally unbelievable plot makes a very bad movie.,2,16 April 2019,"I didn't learn about this movie until I watched ""The Debt"" staring Jessica Chastain, and I looked her up to see what she was in that I may have seen before. I thought she did a good job acting in that film, so I gave this one a chance since she was in it (as well as Sam Waterston and the brilliant John Lithgow). The reviews for this movie seem to be either very good, or very bad, but nothing in the middle. I have seen where several people remarked that the bad reviews were made by people who are against gun control and that the movie has nothing to do with gun control. I think the opposite holds true - the good reviews are made simply because the people who made them are for gun control, not because the movie is worthy of a high review. Make no mistake, this is a very bad movie.I have also seen where people admitted to making their review have a higher rating in order to ""balance out"" a bad review from someone else. I am not doing that here. I gave this movie a 2 simply because that is what I truly feel it deserves.The main review that comes up in IMDB says that this movie is ""not boring for a moment"". Nothing could be further from the truth. This movie is extremely boring from the beginning until the end, with only a very few scenes worth watching. I had a hard time keeping awake for most of the movie. The dialog is basic: not terrible, but not good either. There are a few quotable lines in the movie, but you can probably say that about any film. The basic plot is extremely predicable throughout, but it is also extremely hard to believe. If I am watching a fantasy (like ""Field of Dreams""), I can let my imagination take off and get sucked into a good story even if I know what I'm watching can't possibly take place in real life. The problem is this film is supposed to be believable, and in many ways it is far less believable than dead baseball players coming back to life just to play baseball in an Iowa cornfield. The main character of ""Miss Sloane"" does so many things that someone like her would simply not do, nor would she have been successful if she acted remotely like they way she is portrayed.The acting is okay, not horrible, but not that great either. Overall, Jessica Chastain's performance was very disappointing compared to how she performed in ""The Debt"". John Lithgow was his usual self, and he presented by far the best performance in the entire film. Many of the other supportive actors were not good, which may have also caused the movie to be extremely boring. There is nothing worse than having subpar acting combined with a terrible script, and this film is a classic example of that.The only good thing that this film has going for it is its musical score. The piece played during the closing credits is by far the best part of the movie, and I am not saying that just because I was grateful that the film was finally over, although that may have had something to do with why I enjoyed it so much.If you enjoy watching a movie to be preached to because you can't form your own opinion on political topics, then this film may be the perfect movie for you. If, however, you can think for yourself and watch films for pure entertainment value, then this film should be avoided since it fails miserably in that area.",Miss Sloane

Miss SLOANE didn't win in the Box office 2016 but that movie was 100% talking about women power and impact and how they can start a war or even ended and that's why we see the women power till our day. So, I think the main purpose of the fail in the box office is that the movie discuss the legislative process of the law of guns even if there's high victims their life effected by this cuz ""no one will protect us like us"" so that's why the film is fail other than that if the film was discussing another story the box office number will be totally different.",Miss Sloane
338,babyaardvark-14565,The writing is SO BAD,5,14 June 2018,"The writing is really bad. I'm not talking about the plot, but the dialogue lacks both finesse and sometimes seems like it's been translated badly from another language into English. Take these two gems:
DUPONT to SPERLING: ""You know the root of the word ""annihilate""? It's Latin. It means ""to reduce to nothing"". Ok, first, I'm pretty sure a US Senator knows what annihilate means why are they explaining to the audience?, second, it's derived from annihilare meaning ""reduce to nothing"", but the ROOT of annihilate is nihil, meaning ""nothing"". It's so awkward and clunky!! The playback in the courtroom makes it more effective but the dialogue is so dis-believable.SLOANE: ""It rewards rats who are willing to sell out their country to keep their noses in the trough. Make no mistake, these rats are the real parasites on American democracy."" The expression is pigs at the trough, and rats are vermin not parasites.I like Jessica Chastain, I think the lengthy dialogues and monologues killed her, she gets the timing breathing and emphasis in her phrasing wrong all the time, from the very beginning of the movie. It was distracting. The accents are bad, Lacy as a Southerner is painful, and is Connors supposed to be from Boston? Why do they even NEED accents??There is so much exposition and over explaining to the audience, there is so little nuance or deftness.In the end I didn't care about any of the characters, I didn't care whether the bill passed or was defeated. I didn't care if she went to jail or not. I had zero investment.I guess the surprise ending is satisfying, if also clunky, but I barely made it through.",Miss Sloane
