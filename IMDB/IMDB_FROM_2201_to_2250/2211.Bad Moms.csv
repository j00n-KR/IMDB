0,SnoopyStyle,inappropriate fun,7,3 December 2016,"Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is struggling to do it all. Her kids Jane and Dylan have issues and don't appreciate her. She throws out her husband Mike who cheated online. She's the oldest person at work. Her boss Dale Kipler and co-workers are all young millennials who dismiss her work ethic. She has enough of PTA president Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and quits. She is befriended by inappropriate single mom Carla Dunkler (Kathryn Hahn) and homeschooling Kiki (Kristen Bell). The three new friends become bad moms.It is loads of inappropriate fun when the ladies are being bad moms. There is a life lesson aspect that sometimes get wonky. Nothing gets derailed but the wild times are more fun. Kathryn Hahn continues to be a hilarious lady and she's great here. Kristen Bell is playing against type a little. Mila Kunis started off with some problems. In fact, her start reminded me of that bad Sarah Jessica Parker movie but it got much funnier relatively quick. This is a pretty funny movie.",Bad Moms
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Bad Moms, even worse movie",2,19 December 2017,"""Bad Moms"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2016 written and directed by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, the duo mostly known for The Hangover at this point still. And you could say that their work here is a mom version of the latter, but really a very unfunny one I must say. I may be a bit biased because there are several cast members in here that I am not much a fan of like Hahn, Bell and Smith, so it's no surprise that I would say it is between Hahn and Smith in terms of who is most unbearable in here. Probably Hahn gets the edge because she has so much more screen time, but JPS is a negative scene stealer too. The one who was pretty okay was Applegate, but being a huge MwC fan I'm probably biased here too. And how she completely changes towards the end and tells her big nemesis how her life sucks too was ridiculously bad with how she turns into a friend finally. This was a cringeworthy film from start to finish. Women often complain about how they are depicted in films. Strangely enough, some are mistaking this film for an elaboration on emancipation. Well, they should complain too given this film, but so should the males who are shown as bullies, cheaters etc. or of course Mr. Right. This movie has nothing to do with reality. It lacks authenticity and convincing shades from start to finish and I can only feel sorry for those audience members thinking the trio in here includes actually amazing women despite their flaws and struggles. Oh wait, those make them human no? I can only shake my head at that.Kunis is at the center of it all, but Hahn and Bell get their rushed-in ""deep"" and ""emotionally dramatic"" story lines too that involve the men in their lives that occasionally are also their sons. Pseudo character development of the worst kind. One bad joke follows the next in the film's extremely desperate attempts to be constantly funny. Sometimes less is more you know. I hoped this film would be better to be honest and I went in with an open mind, but I quickly saw this was not a good piece of work before eventually realizing this was horribly bad and a contender for 2016's worst. Shocked to see that this holiday season 2017 they are actually having a sequel out. Judging from this first film here, I have zero interest to watch it. I don't mind profanity if it has some wit attached to it (like South Park), but here this is definitely not the case. Everything about this project feels fake and for the sake of it, especially most of the performances. Kunis' maybe not, but she also does nothing really with her character. She just isn't as terrible as the other key players. The writing certainly isn't helping. A poor predictable excuse of a movie and let me say to my fellow German movie buffs that here we have the American equivalent to a Schweighöfer comedy. For the easily-entertained. The simple-minded. Highly not recommended.",Bad Moms
2,Prismark10,Bad movie,2,19 October 2016,"Mila Kunis plays a hard working mom with two kids. She juggles her work life which involves endless meetings and working extra hours even though she only works part time with her family life of getting the kids ready for school, doing their homework, picking them up for school and taking them to various activities as well as shopping and cooking.We are not sure where the dad fits in all this, he appears to be a slob with an interest in internet porn.No one takes her seriously and when she throws her husband out she falls out with the bullying head of the PTA played by Christina Applegate.Mila along with two other mothers, one who is timid, the other a slovenly herself join ranks and indulge in some bad behaviour of drinking, partying and attracting men.This puts them on a collision course with Applegate who treats the PTA as her very own fiefdom.The film is marketed as a gross out comedy centred on females, a bit like Bridesmaids. It just comes across as wretched and unfunny. The writing is atrocious. You have a head of PTA threatening to sack school staff and doing illegal things yet no one seems to notice even if it is common assault in front of witnesses.It just shows what a poorly contrived mess the whole film is.",Bad Moms
3,nogodnomasters,I would rather go to Afghanistan than another kid's baseball game,7,24 October 2017,"Amy (Mila Kunis) is the lead ""bad mom."" She can no longer be a ""super mom"" in the Chicago suburbs. She befriends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who are also tired of the whole super mom concept. With Wanda Sykes as a marriage counselor, she is a single mom. Amy butts heads with super mom Gwendolyn (no longer a hot teen Christina Applegate) vindictive president of the P.T.A. Amy is ""good at being late."" This is another over-the-top over-sexed potty mouthed woman comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" establish a successful formula and opened the flood gates for future endeavors, i.e. ""Sister"" and anything with Melissa McCarthy. I am not saying this is bad, but sometimes less is more and originality still counts for something.This was a funny comedy, and perhaps would have been funnier if I didn't watch so many films in this genre.Guide: F-word, sex, FF nudity (Leah McKendrick) strong sex talk",Bad Moms
4,kosmasp,Who's bad?,7,15 May 2017,"Humor is universal they say. But some humor isn't. And comedies always will divide people. Some people will think this is hilarious, some others will call it despicable (especially with the language used in this one!). It's kind of like Sex and the City - The Mom Edition. Also boiled down a lot and simplified even more.But to be entertained you don't always need a lot. Great villains would be great (something this movie lacks, giving us stereotypical performances from the Husband and rival mom), but even that can be neglected unless you are expecting a masterpiece in comedy. That's not what you'll be getting here. You will be getting a movie that is raunchy and predictable, but with very likable main characters (our 3 friends by chance). Clichés aplenty floating your way ...",Bad Moms
5,lee_eisenberg,"we have no real lives today, and that's why we need this",10,6 August 2016,"More than just an over-the-top silly comedy, ""Bad Moms"" is a satire on our overly organized lives in the 21st century. The main characters are a group of moms in Chicago who get fed up with their daily schedules - going to work, taking their children to extracurricular activities, etc - and rebel. Basically, they decide to violate all social conventions and live life to its fullest, much to the chagrin of the authoritarian head of the PTA. Everyone in the theater, including myself, was laughing the whole time (especially whenever Carla had a comment).I have a feeling that quite a few moms out there would love to do this. In the meantime, it's been nice to see female-driven comedies this year (along with this one, there's ""The Boss"" and ""Ghostbusters""). I liked the movie, and I hope that the directors do more stuff like this.",Bad Moms
6,paul_haakonsen,When mommy breaks out of the everyday routine...,6,2 May 2017,"""Bad Moms"" was a movie that I was actually looking forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch because I like Mila Kunis, but also because Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate were starring in it.This is the type of comedy movie that you just know will not challenge your intellect, so it is just basically lean well back in the chair and enjoy the ride. I found ""Bad Moms"" to actually be better than I had anticipated it to be, so that was a good surprise.The storyline is quite simplistic really. A group of mothers are fed up with the way that they have to live their lives and perform up to the expectations of every other mother in the PTA group. This liberation leads to a much needed freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.There is a lot of hilarious moments and situations throughout the course of the movie, and the comedy is served to the audience in terms of both practical and visual comedy, but also by some outrageous and funny dialogue.While Mila Kunis actually did a great job in this movie, she was just outshone by Kathryn Hahn and her performance here. The movie was so well carried by the female cast, though again I will credit most of the lifting to Kathryn Hahn.""Bad Moms"" is a very funny and entertaining movie, and if you enjoy comedies where there are little limitations. There might be situations that some people will find to be a bit too much, but hey, this is an R-rated movie.This is also the type of comedy that you can watch again, although I would say that some time should definitely pass in between such multiple viewings. This is hardly a comedy classic, but it still a very enjoyable and entertaining comedy.",Bad Moms
7,Quinoa1984,"funny but bad, does that make sense?",4,3 September 2016,"A little context: all things considered - that my wife and I went to go see The Light Between Oceans (hey, that Fassbender guy, so dreamy) and because of some weird malfunction with their DCP machine or whatever and we were given free tickets and decided to see this as it was playing in a few minutes despite not particularly having interest in seeing it - it wasn't the WORST thing this year (to put it in another way, we stuck through it to the end). Not a surprise is levied for the audience, and not a f*** is given as far as really trying something new with the story.Would I ever tell anyone to see this? No. It's a fairly rote studio comedy, with a slightly higher-than-average R for f***s, with a paint-by-numbers plot and cartoonishly 1/2-dimensional villainess in Applegate (until the last five minutes when we're supposed to LIKE her), and yet there are laughs to be had just due to the throw-***t-at-the-wall approach. Among those throwing wildly with their comedic one-liner pitches, Kathryn Hahn's attempts were not bad, and Mila Kunis is certainly trying and acting well as she can. Ultimately, it shows how the writers of the Hangover (""trilogy"") are basically one trick ponies, if that, and perhaps they should leave their scripts with more capable, actual directors next time (not that I can see too many doing wonders with this script).It's shockingly safe ultimately, which with a title like this and outlook that's all ""hell with being a suburban soccer mom"" you'd hope it could come with more edge and less illogic than this has even in such a silly comedic world (i.e. the supermarket scene and something like how Kunis is able to have her ex's car all this time took me out of the movie, and it shouldn't have).",Bad Moms
8,BandSAboutMovies,Not bad.,6,8 June 2019,"The team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore started their careers by contributing uncredited rewrites to movies like Wedding Crashers, 27 Dresses and Monster-in-Law. Their breakthrough was The Hangover, which gave them the juice they needed to start co-directing movies of their own. This film was a surprise success for them, grossing around $183 million worldwide.Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is married with two kids, living in the Chicago suburbs and working for a cool coffee company. Even though she does everything right, she feels like she's constantly losing, which is exacerbated when catches her husband having cam sex with his mistress.Now, she must learn to deal with being a single mom and battling the moms who do everything right, like Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo).Joining up with Carla (Kathryn Hahn, who voiced the new Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) and Kiki (Kristen Bell, who is great in this), they decide to quit the PTA. However, Gwendolyn gets to our heroine and she decides to challenge her presidency.My favorite part of this film was the credits. No, I'm not being mean. It's a cute little comedy. But the best part is that at the end, the stars answer questions with their real-life mothers. Christina Applegate mentions that her mom (they appeared together in Jaws of Satan) took her to see Al Pacino in Cruising when she was 9 years old. This is even funnier because her TV dad, Ed O'Neill, is also in that film.",Bad Moms
9,grantss,"Good comedy - funny, irreverent and subversive",7,17 June 2017,"Amy is a hard-working mom. Between caring for her two children, shuttling them to activities and having to pick up the slack for her lazy husband, she works at a company filled with millennials who have no work ethic or clue about her life. Even more unproductive is all the nonsense she has to endure just to be a ""good mom"". In particular, PTA meetings and other PTA functions. This leaves her no time for relaxation or just to be herself. One day she rebels against the system and decides to let go, ditching all the unnecessary bs in her life. This gains her some friends among the other moms - two in particular, Carla and Kiki - but pits her against the President of the PTA, Gwendolyn James, who is a nasty piece of work.Good comedy - funny, irreverent and subversive. While not a parent myself, I imagine it shows well all the nonsense parents have to put up with. This is especially the case in terms of what makes for a good parent and all the judgemental types that seem to think they know better about what's good for your kids and life than you. Bound to offend the uptight, humourless and judgemental, which makes it even better.Good performances by the main cast - Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate. Hahn gets the best lines.On the negative side, having struck upon a great comedic and social theme, the writers then try to shoehorn in some sentimentality. This feels out of place and runs contrary to the themes the comedy was espousing. Moreover, it is fairly empty and ruins the momentum of the movie. A straight comedy would have been even better.Overall: a bit uneven but generally good fun.",Bad Moms
10,oscaralbert,"""Bad Moms, Bad Moms, Whatcha Gonna Do . . . """,7,10 August 2016,""" . . . Whatcha Gonna Do When They Come For You?"" The timing of BAD MOMS, coming out the week that reports of Webster being Chelsea's Real Dad are peaking, cannot make this attempt to scuttle America's First Woman Presidency any more blatant than if the filmmakers named Christina Applegate's scheming PTA President ""Crooked Hillary."" Dressed and coiffed as a virtual Clinton clone, Applegate goes around planting illegal drugs in the school lockers of her Presidential Rivals' children. Pontificator of endless speeches, a power elite insider with four yachts and friends such as Martha Stewart at her beck and call, plus a husband who's just been busted for embezzling $100 million from a children's charity, Applegate's character fits the Fox News\Donald Trump caricature of Crooked Hillary to a Tee. BAD MOMS makes Trump's case for repealing the 19th Amendment and taking away the privilege to vote from Hillary's core backers--U.S. women--because they drive the wrong way on one-way streets, perpetrate hit-and-run wrecks, ""graze"" and spew fluids at their local supermarkets and neighborhoods, and neglect America's kids in order to get high while enjoying deviant sex with their own versions of Webster.",Bad Moms

The Hangover writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore collaborate again in their directorial debut that attempts to do for the girls what the guys did in their previous film - shock for laughs and do so in their hit/miss shake and bake style with vulgarity and heart in the mix with a trio of newfound mom friends Kunis, Hahn and Bell who face a Cee You Next Tuesday Applegate PTA bitch from hell while also trying to raise their kids in spite of men behaving badly (among other social pitfalls). The lead three are well served particularly comedy vet Kunis who brings her TV talent to full tilt (less said about Bell frankly who I cannot stand and still cannot fathom how she is successful in her plain vanilla blahness well suited for her more demure character here) and the scene stealing Hahn as the blowzy, boozy babe on the make with raunch élan. Funny but could have been hysterical; nice try ladies. 1/2 star also less for Pinkett-Smith who I hate like poison.",Bad Moms
12,neil-476,Enjoyable female-oriented rudeness,7,23 May 2018,"Amy's life is too busy: her useless husband doesn't help, her daughter has demanding school activities, her annoying boss has turned her part-time job into full-time without paying her for it so, when PTA tyrant Gwendolyn pressures her over cakes at the Bake Sale, Amy cracks and, accompanied by sex-mad Karla and timid and downtrodden Kiki, they decide to leave the demands of motherhood behind in favour of more immediately satisfying activities.This film - according to its publicity - wants to be a female version of The Hangover. But Bridesmaids already did that and, besides, Bad Moms turns out to be about moms who aren't really bad at all, they're just moms.Mila Kunis, as protagonist Amy, plays straight man to Katherine Hahn's very funny horny mom Karla, and Kristen Bell's meek and slapstick-prone Kiki. Christina Applegate plays Machiavellian PTA mastermind Gwendolyn very well despite having one of the least credible changes of heart I can ever recall in a film.There aren't many belly laughs, but I chuckled often. The discussion about circumcised vs uncircumcised amused me, even though I am not the target audience (I'm not sure who the target audience actually was: this sort of raunchy comedy usually seems aimed at the twenteens, but the material here would strike a chord with mothers of school-age children. The two groups aren't mutually exclusive, but they don't have huge crossover either).There is some heart, too, albeit clearly engineered precisely to tug at the heartstrings - Karla's final exchange with her son being a case in point.
And the interviews over the closing credits between the 6 main female actors and their real-life mothers were great.Comedy movies - well, all films, really - are very personal, and what might appeal to one person doesn't necessarily appeal to another. Much US opinion is against this on the grounds that it's anti-male. I didn't give that a thought, and quite liked it.",Bad Moms
13,morrison-dylan-fan,Bad to the bone.,8,24 January 2017,"Helping out a friend who is ill,I felt that a Comedy might cheer her up a bit. Making a note of the title after sadly missing it at cinemas,I was pleased to see that it has now come out on DVD,which led to me finally finding out how bad these moms could be.The plot:From the moment she gets up, Amy Mitchell takes a hands-on approach at her kids schools, (with PTA head of the school Gwendolyn James always looking down on her)and uses any spare time to work at a hip coffee shop. Feeling their marriage is in trouble,Amy goes to talk to Mike,and finds him having internet sex with a Camgirl he has known for 10 months.Kicking Mike out,Amy soon closes paths with fellow mums Carla and Kiki,who join Amy in becoming tearing up their nice image,and becoming hard-rocking bad mums.View on the film:Making the film when pregnant with her second child, Mila Kunis gives a sparkling performances as Amy,who is given a raunchy sass by Kunis that is balanced by a sweet thoughtfulness for her family. Joining Amy on wild nights out, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell give hilarious performances as Carla and Kiki,with Bell keeping Kiki buttoned up,and Hahn jumping into the slap-stick and letting Carla's hair down. Hissing at the rebels, Christina Applegate gives a wicked boo-hiss performance as busybody Gwendolyn. Splattering the tasks on Amy's plate across the screen,co- writers/co-directors Jon Lucas & Scott Moore and cinematographer Jim Denault give the physical comedy a brash,slap-stick atmosphere,hit with stylish slow-mo which brings to focus the wild partying moments of the bad moms. Backed by an awesome soundtrack which includes Janelle Monáe,the directors keep close to the group and elegantly express the bond they have.Watching Amy catch her husband when he really needs to clean his internet history,the screenplay by Moore and Lucas packs the film with risqué charms, spilling from the women going on a late night shopping spree,to Amy treading on Gwendolyn's stuck-up heels. Whilst breaking out the laughs when the women let their hair down,the writers give the punchlines a personal quality,with Amy's change in outlook helping to create a closer relationship with her children,as the bad mums put the bad boys in the shade.",Bad Moms
14,anaconda-40658,Bad Movie.,2,8 August 2016,"Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Bad Moms
15,FlashCallahan,I would let him go to town back there......,6,5 November 2016,"Amy has a seemingly perfect life, but she's overworked, over-committed and exhausted to the point that she's about to snap. Fed up, she joins forces with two other similar mothers on a quest to liberate themselves from mundane responsibilities, by going on a wild binge of long overdue freedom, fun and self-indulgence.But this puts them on a collision course with PTA Queen Gwendolyn and her clique of devoted perfect moms........Alarm bells ring whenever the word Bad is featured in a movie title. After debacles such as Bad Teacher and even Bad Santa, I wasn't really looking forward to this. That and the fact that it looked like a pseudo cash in on the success of Bridesmaids made the bells louder.But unexpectedly, it's a pleasant surprise. The makers could have easily gone done the gross out route of humour involving lots of human fluids and people in situations that leave them covered in some sort of 'grunge'.Characters are likable, even the ones that appear to be the most abhorrent stereotypical cutie cooker caricatures are treated with respect and turn out not to be the walking trope you would expect. For example, the husband, the outrageous friend, and of course, the chief bad guy.Although the films plot is that of a well worn formula, group of people rebel, the antagonist gets wind of this and makes their life hard, so they compete with each other, and of course, don't forget the quiet one of the rebels who finally gets some bottle at the beginning of the third act.But it's all a pleasant experience. Kunis is wonderful as the lead, and proves that she can carry a film. It's funny without going over the top with the innuendo and swearing, and that in itself is a refreshing change for a comedy.",Bad Moms
16,zetes,"No masterpiece, perhaps, but, lordy, it's fun",8,31 July 2016,"I wasn't expecting much out of this one, but, man, was it a ton of fun. I can't claim it's a great or deep film in any way, but when I laughed at a comedy as much as I did this one, that's a success. Mila Kunis plays a career woman and mother of two who is ready to drop dead from her thousand-obligations-a-day life. When pushed by ultra-mom Christina Applegate, she publicly gives up. Joining in her rebellion are slutty single mom Kathryn Hahn and secluded, dorky housewife Kristen Bell. The premise, and, indeed, the entire script, are pretty negligible, but it's just fun to be around these three party animal ladies and their drunken escapades (the writer/director duo is probably most famous for writing The Hangover movies). Kunis is a fine protagonist (it's hard for me to accept little Jackie from That '70s Show as a mother of two middle schoolers), but Hahn and Bell own the movie. God, they're hilarious. I hope this finally gets the public to recognize Hahn for the great comic actress she is. The villains (Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith and Annie Mumalo being the rival moms, Clark Duke the too-young boss, and David Walton Kunis' cheating husband) could have used a bit more work, but they were mostly fun. Certainly this was one of the more surprisingly good movies of summer '16. I think it'll be a huge hit, too, seeing as the audience I saw it with was eating it up. It actually garnered applause, the first time in a long while I've heard that in the theater.",Bad Moms

And I do think I have a good sense of humor so that can not be the problem. The problem with Bad Moms is that the humor is so childish. And without being a sexist this movie is just a chick flick. Not that women have no sense of humor, far from that, but besides an audience of female teenagers I can't see other people enjoying this movie. The story is also really lame. They try to be funny but it just doesn't work. The acting is okay though. They're clearly not the worst thing in this movie. If I gave it a three it's for Mila Kunis, who is a beautiful women.

Outside of that opening, said comment starts to feel heavy-handed, which isn't helped by the excessive running time.

A Good Laugh is guaranteed!'Bad Moms' Synopsis: When three overworked and under-appreciated moms are pushed beyond their limits, they ditch their conventional responsibilities for a jolt of long overdue freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.'Bad Moms' is about Mothers & how they manage to raise their kids, sometimes their husbands & also run the house on their merit. And if you push their buttons beyond a point, they sure will break loose & party like a mother. The film nicely blends some really funny humor with its heartfelt message to all the mothers around the world. Of course, the film isn't perfect, but its intention with the touch of comedy, do the trick.Jon Lucas & Scott Moore's Screenplay is good, although the sub-plots (particularly Mila running for PTA elections), don't engage much. Nonetheless, its fun watching these moms have fun. Lucas & Moore's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done.Another prime reason why 'Bad Moms' works so well is because of its splendid cast. Mila Kunis is absolutely fantastic as the central mom here, delivering an affecting & genuinely lovable performance from start to end. Kristen Bell melts your heart with her cute portrayal of a timid women, while Kathryn Hahn is unabashedly brash all through & also brings in the best laughs. Christina Applegate is terrific as the antagonist. She's deliciously mean! Jada Pinkett Smith & Annie Mumolo as Applegate's vamps do well, but I wish they got as much scope as Applegate. Jay Hernandez is in fine form after a long time. Clark Duke is first-rate, as always.On the whole, 'Bad Moms' is definitely worth your time.",Bad Moms
20,DKosty123,I Had No Idea This Was Going On,7,6 August 2016,"From the writers of The Hangover, another funny film.In a way this movie could be titled ""Mom's Revenge"". It is a comedy about how much moms have to do raising kids and how under appreciated they are. With all the humor and punch lines, a comedy with an actual theme is more than a little unusual. What really brings this movie is the cast. The script is more than a little unbalanced. Considering it is about this subject, it is a natural.Mila Kunis leads the parade of mom's here with plenty of good help. She is a bad mom, though here, quite by accident, she turns out to be a good mom after all, maybe. There is verbal comedy, and physical comedy. Warning, there are some very adult themes here too, much less some great skin shown in a few sections. It is a defined R movie for sexual and language references. Christina Applegate actually plays the dictatorial PTA President Gwendolyn in a way that would make Roseanne jealous. She really lines up in the feud with Amy that gives the gags more substance and effect. Mila Kunis(Amy), Kathryn Hahn (Carla) and Kristen Bell (Kiki) work well together as a team. Seems like Hahn gets a lot of physical comedy though Kunis gets some in a couple of parts too. Warning- Do not trying talking on the cell phone while driving like Amy does at home. Remember this is a movie and it does suggest that stupid idea again, even though the folks who try that in real life wind up RIP.This is really a woman's flick much like 9 to 5 was years ago where women rule the day. The men's roles are few and get very little screen time and the attitude is they are ""tools"" of the women all the way through. The plot itself is quite predictable, but the punch lines carry this movie along well. Especially, watch for the cameos of Martha Stewart, because they are funny.The film is not too long, and really plays like a mom's fantasy of what being a mother with kids can be. This is kind of like Disney World for mom's with a lot of comedy mixed in.At the end, when the credits role, there is a nice sequence added with all the main actresses talking with their real mom's. I think this is a nice touch instead of having out takes at the end. I have a feeling the DVD will have the out takes, and considering how funny the film is, I have a feeling this gag reel will be a reason to buy the DVD. So if you miss this one in the theater, wait for it on the DVD.",Bad Moms

The movie stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn (as the three lead moms); and it costars Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith, Annie Mumolo, Jay Hernandez, David Walton and Clark Duke. It was written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; the duo previously performed both duties on the teen sex comedy flick '21 & OVER' (and they also co-wrote a little movie called 'THE HANGOVER'). The film has done well at the Box Office (so far), and it's also gotten decent reviews from movie critics. I enjoyed it, but it does have it's flaws.Amy Mitchell (Kunis) works, nonstop, to provide for her family. She catches her slacker husband (Walton) cheating on her, one night on the internet, and kicks him out. After that her life becomes a complete mess; until she meets two other mothers (Bell and Hahn) with similar problems. The three become best friends, and they all learn to relax (and party) together. This causes a lot of concern from other (more uptight) mothers, especially the power hungry Gwendolyn (Applegate), and a battle begins. The movie is funny, and I really like the concept behind it. It's also nice to see more raunchy comedy flicks, starring all women (that also deal with real women problems); but it would also be nice to see these films written and directed by more women, as well though. The cast is all decent, but I think Hahn's part is a little too over-the-top; and I also think Smith's talents are wasted (in a throwaway role). Kunis is OK, but someone like Tina Fey could have really made her part work. With that said, Bell and Applegate are perfectly cast (and they're also both hilarious in it). Some of the material is a little weak, as well, but other parts are brilliant. It's definitely a hit-and-miss comedy flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",Bad Moms
22,thesar-2,Bad Mom's Night Out,9,13 November 2016,"Why the HELL wasn't she running in 2016? She has my vote!I would say while 2016 has been MUCH better to us in regards to higher quality cinema than 2015, Bad Moms would be a perfect double feature with a movie just squeezed out at the end of 2015: Sisters. To sum up the entire movie review, if you liked Sisters, you'd LOVE Bad Moms. and spoiler, I even love Bad Moms more than Sisters. So, make sure you schedule Sisters first just to end on this high note.I rate this movie very high because I did have a blast, laughed a ton and felt the heart – enough to tear up at the ending, but it's not 100% perfect. It's the movie people want this kind of movie to be and with that wish, you get the standard tropes and predictable scenes. To me, once you grab me, those don't matter. Movies still can work with clichés and obvious heartfelt scenes as long as they established themselves upfront with good writing, believable acting and a good time. Bad Moms did that in spades.The movie's not very complex. A mother is doubting her ability as a parent thanks to society's teaching of being a perfect momor mostly thanks to our antagonist, PTA President Bitch Gwendolyn. But, a snowball of a bad day turns our heroine into the truth of what all the school's mothers really are. Against all oddsshe has to become real.Truly, I laughed out loud many times, but also saw the heart and realness to these actresses. Sure, there were dumb men, and the ""perfect"" man, but neither I nor the writers bash men in what could've been a ""Mom's Rule! Dad's Drool!"" script. We could empower the women without having to consider them just one side of the sexes.I truly enjoyed this ride. It's not just about girl-power here. It's about learning to live your life, the life you feel you missed out on to be a parent and balancing being a parent and human. Plus, it's no holds barred on the language and innuendos. Can always appreciate that.that, and always gotta love me some Jay Hernandez. Man. I've had a thing for him for over a decade. What a manI digress. See this! (Plus Sisters with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Grab a bottle of shitty wine, pop in Sisters and then watch this. You will NOT regret it.)***Final thoughts: Last Christmas, or was it Mother's Day or my mom's birthday? I can't recall. I bought my mother the DVD of Moms' Night Out. I heard a solid recommendation from a movie critic about it and I knew it would be a nice Christian movie for her. I watched it prior to gifting it to her, and I actually did like it. It was refreshing to see a woman's night out on the town film that had no raunch to it. Not that I am opposed to that – once again, I recommend the extremely raunchy Sisters and Bad Moms. But, that movie worked on its own showing it didn't need all the R-rated stuff. That all saidif you want that, plus true adult fare, see this. It's that movie on real-time with the world. Moms' Night Out is what they want the world to be, Bad Moms is what the world is.",Bad Moms
23,FeastMode,my notes,7,1 July 2019,Surprisingly very funny with a nice story that makes sense and isn't useless.

Now, taking back control of her life her and her new friends stand up to Gwendolyn (Applegate) and the other perfect moms and let everyone know that it's OK not to be perfect. This is a movie I was was hoping would be funny, but being a guy I wasn't the target audience and wasn't sure if I would relate. I was wrong. This movie is hilarious regardless of what sex your are and being a single dad I can also relate to some of what was being said. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic (which is not my intention) this is a raunchy male sex comedy starring women. The thing this has going for it over most movies like this is that the message doesn't get lost in the comedy and really helps add to the overall enjoyment of this. Overall, one of the funniest movies of the year and one that men and women will both love. That is hard to do in a movie like this. I give this an A.",Bad Moms
26,Reno-Rangan,Moms don't quit! Quitting's for dads!,6,24 October 2016,"It was more like a middle aged women's version of 'How to be Single'. So most of the younger audience won't get it, as well as the older people, because of the generation gap. I enjoyed it, but you know this is nothing close to any classic on the similar theme, just a decent entertainer though. From the director of '21 & Over', about the three moms whose children are in the high school, but it depicts those moms struggles over maintain the order in their professional and personal life.Mila Kunis' character is the centre of the story, but I liked Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn as well. Basically, these three ruled the narration. Some of the comedies were good, though there are too much of sexual references in that. Not good as 'How to be Single', but definitely better than both the 'Bad Neighbours' films.It got a mixed response, but a box office hit. Most of the story is predictable, though decently developed all the scenes by keeping them simple. I mean cliché wise, but at some parts it gets loud and out of control. So make sure you are not watching for any inspiration, but the middle aged people feel more familiar with this than anybody else. Therefore, I think they're the target audience, and mostly the women.6/10",Bad Moms
27,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,25 November 2018,"""Bad Moms"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch a mom trying to handle everything in her house and work. Her husband does not help her and she has to do everything by herself from going their kids to school to clean the house. Everything changes when she finds two other women who are at mostly the same situation as her and they all start to change their conventional responsibilities in order to find some time for themselves.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and was seriously thinking that it's going to be different from other comedies with parents which I had already seen. Unfortunately, this didn't happen because the plot was boring and a few funny scenes could not save this movie. The simple plot isn't bad and this was proved in many movies but it's not working for this movie. Despite the simple and boring plot, I liked the interpretations of Mila Kunis who played as Amy and Kristen Bell who played as Kiki and she was hilarious at some points. The direction which was made by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore was an average but I have to say that I really liked the ending of this movie which was beautiful.Finally, I believe that ""Bad Moms"" isn't a bad movie just another average one with which you can spend your spare time, laugh a bit and enjoy it. Just don't expect much from this movie and you won't be disappointed by it.",Bad Moms
28,Floated2,Feels forced for crude content,3,5 November 2017,"Bad Moms has a decent cast and the chemistry works among the lead actresses but overall the film tries too hard and forced in using overly sexual and crude content and for laughs and humor. Mila Kunis is very likable as the lead character as this was a good role for her, Kristen bell played her role well as for Katheryn Hanh was there for the crude and sexual jokes (most of which wore off and her act was not funny in the least). and Kr Deemed as a female version of the Hangover or slightly lesser version of Bridemaids, it is clear the intentions of Bad Moms was made due to those films being big successes. Though when we think of it, Bad Moms somewhat feels as an R-rated version of Mean Girls.Bad Moms was a surprise hit which is why the studios quickly greenlit a sequel an released it only one year later, however that doesn't mean the demand was such as high for a sequel. As many comedy films that are surprise or overachieving box office hits, their sequels usually end up under performing (in recent years- Ted 2, Neighbors 2). Overall the film isn't as funny as it could have been since a lot is forced and not very realistic, and the jokes do not stick. Predictable as well with a cop out type ending.",Bad Moms
29,TheMovieDiorama,Bad Moms is just another average American comedy.,5,2 March 2018,"Just so I clear this off my mind, annoyingly the American title remains for the UK release. Honestly, ""Bad Mums"" would've sufficed surely? I understand why (because the mothers are American) but still! Maybe it's just my OCD playing a part. Anyway, for this comedy we follow a few ""moms"" who are sick and tired of doing everything...and so they choose to rebel. So now you're asking: how do ""moms"" rebel? Well, they go partying trying to get laid and wreak havoc in slow motion within a supermarket to the background music of pounding pop/dance songs. I could easily go down the whole ""this is completely anti-male"" route...but let's take this with a pinch of salt and just enjoy it. As you all know, American comedies don't stick with me. Fortunately, this is actually above average and that's majorly down to the cast. Mila Kunis was great, she had charisma and screen presence. Christina Applegate is always a delight, even if she's the antagonist but the standout is Kathryn Hahn who's vulgarity and crudeness just gets results. Hear me out...I laughed twice because of her. Me laughing twice is like Christmas coming early, it doesn't happen often. Oh, Jada Pinkett Smith should not be on the front cover, she has like 5 lines of dialogue. Underused. Some of the jokes felt fresh but the majority of them were repeated from other films. Particularly the bra scene which was copying last year's The Boss...why on earth would you want to copy that I do not know. The story was functional, the basis of it revolved around a PTA election...I enjoyed it, nothing too memorable though. I guess in the back of my mind...I find the whole concept silly. If I was under that amount of stress (God knows I have been), I would just talk to someone...I wouldn't rebel. You don't see me starring in a film called ""Bad Employees"". My reviews for comedies always seem harsh, but honestly I was entertained and found it to be enjoyable enough to warrant another viewing in the future.",Bad Moms

Soon, she and 2 other moms, Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) decide to relax and have fun by cutting down their everyday routines. Applegate (Anchorman, Married with Children) plays Gwendolyn, an obnoxious, PTA member and Smith (Collateral) plays her friend, Stacy.

31,paul-allaer,"""I'm Amy Mitchell and I'm a mom"": moms gone wild!",7,5 August 2016,"""Bad Moms"" (2016 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Amy (played by Milo Kunis). As the movie opens, we hear the voice over announce ""I'm Amy Mitchell and I'm a mom"". We get to know Amy and how she's trying to cope with her stressful daily routing, juggling an overworked/underpaid job, a do-nothing and cheating husband, entitled kids and, oh yea, a dog with vertigo. One evening Amy is in a bar with two other moms, Kiki (played by Kirsten Bell) and Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn). It's not long before they all agree they've had enough, and decide to become 'bad moms'. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from co-writers/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who seemingly want to perfect the art of 'bad' movies in the best possible ways (""21 And Over"", ""The Hangover"" etc.). Here they touch on a possible raw nerve in our society, namely the insane expectations that are put on moms everywhere, trying to do 500 things a do, and not just do them, but EXCEL in them. In the few serious moments of the movie, there are one or two monologues by Amy addressing these. But for the most part, the movie is about the ""moms gone wild"", and the movie works nicely at that level. The best moments are when we see the three ladies together. There is a scene in which they discuss how to potentially deal with a man in bed who is not circumsized. It's raunchy but rip-roaring, laugh-out-loud fun. (If raunchy humor is not your then d yourself a favor and check out a different movie.) There is a ton of fun songs throughout the movie, the best being when we see Amy and her two kids driving in the car and singing along to Walk the Moon's ""Shut Up and Dance"". Priceless moment.""Bad Moms"" had a very respectable opening week at the box office. Now going into its second weekend, the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended quite nicely, and overwhelmingly women I might add (I was one of just a handful guys in the theatre). Bottom line: if you are in the mood for some mindless fun about ""moms gone wild"" as I was after a stressful day at the office today, ""Bad Moms"" is just the thing for you. Best enjoyed in the theater with a bunch of people in a similar mindset.",Bad Moms
32,jtindahouse,A really nice surprise,9,29 August 2016,"I admit I went into 'Bad Moms' with low expectations. Almost every female comedy I've been told is good and then given a chance to has let me down. 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Other Woman' are the two most recent cases that come to mind. They were tame and just lacked any genuinely funny moments. So I got a nice surprise when I found myself enjoying the hell out of 'Bad Moms'. An 'R' rating gave the cast so much freedom to work with, and they took it. A lot of the dialogue was seriously vulgar (in a hilarious way) to the extent I imagine a lot of male stars in Hollywood would hesitate at saying a lot of it. The story is simple, but that was all it needed. Just a frame for the these women to then work their magic amongst. There are certainly conflicts and problems to overcome, but that never weighs down the comedy. The main three cast members Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn all had tremendous chemistry together and the rest of the cast fit nicely into the mould and deliver some hilarity of their own. There's also a bit of a 'The Hangover' feel about it at times. Some of the party scenes are so well directed that they put you in the mood to party yourself. The music throughout is perfectly selected as well. This is a very good comedy that male and female audience members will be able to enjoy equally. A great effort.",Bad Moms

Chemistry with is there but barely. Mila Kunis is not that convincing has a stressed out mother, maybe it's me but I had trouble buying it. Kathryn Hahn I really liked has the trampy mom, proves has the movie goes on she's a likable 3 dimensional character. Kristen Bell is okay, nothing really terrific here. She and Hahn did give an little chuckle here and there. Jada Pickett Smith is so lifeless in her role has a PTA member. Christina Applegate is okay has an unlikable PTA leader, but she is not giving any funny lines here.

At least I did. Mila plays a typical hard working mother of 2. She tries juggling all her mom/wife duties with a career and ends up being overly stressed out. No one appreciates her or what all she does including her husband and kids. Christina plays the head of the P.T.A. and she takes her job seriously. She likes to make rules and gets her jollies enforcing them and lording it over everyone. Mila finally blows her top and says enough is enough with trying to be the perfect mom. Kathryn and Kristen are other moms who agree with her and become close friends in her mini revolt. Basically, the point is about how tough it is to be a good mom and raise your kids to become productive adults-as opposed to self-centered, overachieving, self-entitled little monsters-and still have some 'me' time to enjoy life. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Martha Stewart, Wanda Sykes and J J Watt-I think he does HEB commercials. At the very end, as the credits start, they have the actors sitting with their real moms and they tell stories about themselves being bad moms. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug & alcohol content and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. It is a little crude and is definitely not for kids-I saw several people with kids that looked under the age of 10 in my showing-but I thought it was funny. I would probably buy it on DVD.",Bad Moms

Mila Kunis is beautiful, as always, and is a superb actress. And Kathryn Hahn is occupying her usual niche. Kristen Bell was another good choice for her role. Also noting Christina Applegate playing against type as a very unlikeable character. There was some mildly annoying directing, and they did try to pass off New Orleans as Chicago.

She is amusing and keeps the film chugging along, helped by the pacing and music which also move the film along nicely. There is a good amount of gags, I certainly enjoyed watching it.Away from Kunis (Amy), you have a whole host of recognizable faces. Kristen Bell (Kiki) and Kathryn Hahn (Agath..sorry, Carla) are pleasant in their respective roles, Hahn is borderline irritating but I'd say she sticks to the right side just about. Christina Applegate (Gwendolyn) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Stacy) also feature, as does Wendell Pierce (Daryl). Shoutout, also, to 'The Walking Dead' alum Ann Mahoney.There are also sweet end credit scenes. It's a lot better than 2017's 'Fun Mom Dinner' too, no doubt about it.

41,kirbylee70-599-526179,Emphasis On The Word Bad,2,22 November 2016,"BAD MOMS could be the perfect example of what is wrong with movies today. Rather than allow a combined effort by producer and director to meld together to make something memorable or at least worth watching more than once, studios now seem controlled by corporate boardrooms who eye only the return on investment, judging by cookie cutter playbooks rather than creativity. Watching a movie like this you have to wonder if they ever looked at the script or just cut and paste moment from various movies changing the names of characters as they went.The movie revolves around Amy (Mila Kunis), an overworked and under-appreciated mom of two. She works full time yet is paid part time by a group of millennials more concerned with the going to concerts than working, has a work at home mortgage broker husband who doesn't lift a finger to help and her two kids are the stereotypical youngsters, one an overachiever fretting over college in in 7 years and the other and underachiever who is happy with a D. Amy is perpetually late to everything and frazzled by her life.One night she catches her husband masturbating to a woman on screen and discovers he's been doing so for 10 months so she kicks him out. After a late PTA meeting where she says she will no longer participate by their rules she goes out for a drink and makes friend with 2 other moms also fed up. Carla (Kathryn Hahn) is the wild one, the do what she wants, ignore her kid party animal who sleeps with any and every one she can. Kiki (Kristen Bell) is the timid home keeper who abides by her husband's rules all the time going so far as to iron his underwear while trying to corral 4 terror inspiring children. So naturally they get drunk and have a good time.The next morning Amy decides she's had enough. No more perfect mom or at least pretense to be so. She tells the kids to make their own breakfast. She drops them at school with Arby's for lunch. She goes to breakfast alone, is called by her boss asking where she is and when told to come in tells him she only gets paid to work 3 days a week and it's her day off. And finally she faces off the prim, proper and all controlling picture of mom perfection, PTA President Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), at the latest bake sale. This sets in motion a challenge for the lead of the PTA between the two which forms most of the rest of the film.What we end up with is another gross out crude frolic in fun according to corporate execs. It's not enough that nearly every teen movie these days has to have kids overindulging in sex, drugs and alcohol, the time has arrived when we want to encourage the same from parents in an attempt to show just how cool they are too. Granted life can be stressful and you want to cut lose now and then but not to the extremes on display here. Soccer moms don't rally around a non-conformists by going to her house, getting ripped and kissing one another.I kept expecting to see Seth Rogen or Will Ferrell show up at any moment while watching this film. It was like someone said see how these movies are made, let's make one of those movies but instead of guys put women in the same roles. The whole time they ignore the fact that none of those movies have done major business like they did when they first began being made and were unlike anything around at the time. They are now the cliché films that were attacking cliché films when they were made. They are predictable, lame and unfunny. At least now we can say women can be the same way.That's another troubling thing about this movie. After years of feminists trying to prove they are equal to or better than men (and in many ways they can be) it feels as if that's all been tossed aside to show they can be just as worthless too. The concept of Amy taking back control of her life here may sound like a good idea but in this story it just makes her look like she is more concerned with herself than her kids even though the movie tries to make you feel otherwise by the last 20 minutes.Characters are cardboard cut outs here rather than fleshed out individuals. The jerk dad, the frazzled mom, the uptight authority figure, the hunk you immediately fall in love and bed with. They've all been seen before. It just feels like they took these characters from teen films and aged them just a tad, enough so they're now adults but not too old so the kids can still relate to them.It saddens me these days to consider the output being made on film. In search of blockbusters or quick return on investments Hollywood has tossed aside any hope of movies that will stand the test of time. With the exception of a few that have been outstanding can you name movies you've seen this past year that you plan to revisit in the future? I can't. But I can tell give you at least 10 movies made from the 30s to the 80s that I could. I just hope that young people can truly realize the fast that they're being sold product instead of entertainment. I fear that they're not.",Bad Moms

When it also features female leads doing outrageous, raunchy things, it seems to be the type of humor I appreciate. Movies like Bridesmaids and Bachelorette, where the women are the focus and can do any crazy thing the guys from hangover could. Well, Kathryn Hahn sets the bar up a few notches, essentially giving us a female version of Bad Santa. The image of her running down the rent-a-cop in the grocery store will forever be burned in my memory. And for anyone who has kids in today's fast paced society, much of the commentary will ring true. Christina Applegate's completely over-the-top PTA mom is as ridiculous as any character from a Monty Python skit, yet rings completely true. Somehow, these are the parents that seem to grow in numbers every year in the U.S. Lots of great moments and biting humor all the way through.

45,rgkarim,"Mom's the word in this stupid, silly, surprisingly moral filled movie",7,28 July 2016,"Moms, everyone at some point has had one in some shape or form. Our world today focuses on portraying these lovely women (and sometimes men) as either saints or monsters depending on the acts. Over the years the image of a mom has changed, often gearing towards being a perfect role model who does no wrong and should she make a mistake is cast as a cretin. However, tonight's film decides to explore a different venue, one that is certain to be entertaining to some audiences. Yes, I'm talking about Bad Moms, a comedy that is certain to start up online riots. Hi Robbie K here and I'm back with another review, let's get started. The GOOD  Delivers what's promised in the trailers  Short run time  Decent story with good morals  Good actingThis review is difficult to write, because I have to keep in mind the target audience the developers had in mind. If you haven't seen the trailers, then you might not know that Bad Moms is an over-the-top, ridiculous comedy geared towards moms, and guess what that is exactly what you get. If you were expecting something different, then you will be disappointed, but this movie certainly delivers the silliness promised. It's comedy is geared towards what many of my female friends joke about including sexual innuendos, superficial lust jokes, and more meme worthy quotes than you can count. Especially in the beginning, the movie is a one- stop joke box that draws as much stupidity as possible, which kept much of the audience laughing. While the comedy may not have been up my alley, to my surprise Bad Moms had a decent story. Again one shouldn't be surprised that the movie has a plot geared towards mothers and the issues they face. I myself began to roll my eyes at the cheesy drama of the plot and the emphasis on superficial things like sex, alcohol, and a bit of drugs. However, the second act packed that sentimental punch that really hooked me into the movie. The morals embedded in the over dramatic speeches and symphony laden sequences are very powerful and may teach significant others and kids an important lesson. I applaud the directors for being able to drive such a message in a comedy like this, but that certainly gained bonus points in my book. Again, mothers will feel this point the most, but those who have an open mind might feel it in your heart as well Another saving grace is the acting in this movie. I went in expecting really bad work to mold out of the word work and shallow talent. And in truth I kind of got what I expected, but also got some surprises. Mila Kunis did a nice job in this simplistic role, and was able to inject some depth into it. Kathryn Hahn is your number one comedy guru, doing nothing but acting like an ass and having a mouth to go with it. Kristen Bell iscute, but her character's awkwardness has a limited role of providing a few good lines and very empowering moment. As for the bad girls, well nothing really magical about this performance, other than yeah they are good at being a five-letter word for a dog. The BAD  Very lazy writing  Stupid  Not really uniqueThis is tough to write and not upset people, but I'll do my best. Yes, the movie does deliver what the trailer promised, but that doesn't mean it's the best quality when compared to other films. Bad Moms writing is essentially how many rants, shouts, and one-liner quotes can be fit in a ninety-minute run time. It's fun and enjoyable, but it certainly is lazy writing, especially once the F bombs and penis grenades are dropped. Sometimes these jokes are timed very well, or delivered in a manner that capitalizes the fun (thank you Kathryn Hahn). However, the sheen does dull after the tenth iteration and had me bored until the story picked up. The lack of cleverness also shows just how stupid the movie is as well. Something else that may cross the line is some of the more intense party moments our directors filmed (alcohol anyone). As such, the unique quality of this film is very lacking and quickly falls into the mediocre milieu that plagues the theaters these days. In addition, some of the comedy could be ""insulting"" to the more traditional member. Therefore exercise caution, pay attention to the rating, and avoid the movie if you are easily offended. The VerdictBad Moms is certainly not the best film to arrive at the silver screen, but it is also exactly what you expected from the trailers. The team certainly created a movie geared toward the mom audience and I have no doubt most in this category, and a few significant others, will laugh their heads off. Therefore I have to give points to the directors for delivering the promised laughs and story. However, it still is a very simplistic movie that does not contain anything really unique, nor the best comedy I have seen. It's just fun. Other than for a girl's night out, I cannot recommend this one for the theater, but certainly take a look at it on RedBox. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5-8.0 (because it delivers to its category) Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0",Bad Moms
46,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Bad Moms,7,12 August 2016,"In Bad Moms (my latest review), Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, and Christina Applegate are perfectly realized as characters. Hahn is a comic force of nature playing single mom Carla. She is for lack of a better word, a promiscuous potty mouth (not to mention the definition of a female Rob Corddry). Bell is spot-on as Kiki, a dorky, socially inept mother of four. Finally, Applegate is pure evil as Gwendolyn, the antagonistic head master of the PTA (you know, the parent-teacher association).Anyway, ""Moms"" feeling like Bridesmaids meets 1999's Office Space, is the most surprising release of 2016. It starts off as a family comedy only to descend into massive F-bombs, fierce sexual innuendo, conversations about circumcision, and a reference to Fifty Shades of Grey. Translation: It's funny as heck. Yeah it's an R-rated vehicle that takes place in a middle school. Yeah it has child actors in many a frame. And yes, it deals with uncomfortable themes of midlife crisis parenting. No matter. Bad Moms combines the sweet, the moral, and the raunchy all in one fell swoop. ""Mother did it need to be so (pause) high?"" Natch.Now in normal fashion, I viewed its clichéd trailer recently on YouTube with some of the comments almost making sense (one YouTube viewer actually predicted that it would be quote unquote, ""complete trash""). Boy was I wrong after attending a midday screening. ""Moms"" tries to provide you with a hearty laugh in almost every scene. It succeeds about 90% of the time so no complaints here.Taking place in Chicago for the umpteenth time (what movie doesn't take place in the ""Windy City"" these days), containing a feel-good ending, and featuring a left field cameo by Martha Stewart (she makes everyone jello shots with vodka, nice), Bad Moms chronicles young and exhausted mother, Amy Mitchell (played by Mila Kunis). Amy has two kids and takes care of them like no one's business. She cooks, cleans, and even works at a coffee company while her husband sits on his butt doing nothing (I guess he has a job but said job doesn't entail too much). Ticked off and fed up, Amy has a meltdown at a PTA meeting and quits to the chagrin of Applegate's Gwendolyn (as mentioned earlier). She then decides to get drunk, have some me time, and join forces with two other moms (Hahn and Bell) in her vicarious plight. They go to the movies during the day, throw a party to get all the other PTA moms on their side, and trash a supermarket without so much as getting arrested. Watch for a sequence where Amy steals her hubby's red Muscle Car and drives like a maniac. Also, look for the reclusive Wanda Sykes in a small role as a jiving marriage counselor to Ames and her worse half (Mike Mitchell played by David Walton).Bottom line: If you're a working mother or a stay-at-home mom, you'll find this flick quite amusing. You might identify with it or you might not. Either way, Bad Moms with its foul-mouthed dialogue and its ode to most things unladylike, is a ""good"" movie. Ha-ha get it. Rating: 3 stars.Of note: During the closing credits for ""Moms"", we get to see interviews with the stars of the film (Kunis, Hahn, Bell, Applegate, Smith, Annie Mumolo) plus their real-life mothers. Yeah it's kinda weird to view this at the end of something that's equal parts filthy and coarse. Oh well. Like everything else in Bad Moms, it just seems to work. Oh and by the way, these actresses look almost identical to their parental units (especially with regards to Kathryn Hahn).",Bad Moms
47,bkrauser-81-311064,A Cookie-Cutter Comedy,6,7 August 2016,"So you're thinking of buying a ticket to Bad Moms. Maybe you saw the trailer and you thought the premise looks interesting. Maybe the collective star-power of Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate was just too tempting and you're just jonesing for a fix of bacchanalian comedy. If you do I would like to be the first to welcome you to Half-Baked R-Rated Comedy Land where original ideas are warmly welcomed before being sanitized, pacified and made soullessly marketable for the sake of a healthy domestic box-office. Please take notes and pay attention; with any luck after watching Bad Moms you too can make a mediocre comedy befitting exploitation and completely lacking substance.First you need an ""original"" comedic idea. It's easier than it sounds, all you need is to take something innocuous and/or innocent, mix it with a few symbols of marketable rebellion and touch on a few cultural lines of demarcation while feigning social commentary to make it look edgy. You also need a sassy title; one that takes a monosyllabic trigger word and somehow links it with the plot, like Bad Santa (2003) or Sex Tape (2014) or Old School (2003). Voila you got your script!""Wait a minute,"" I hear you cry, ""Doesn't a script have like scenes and dialogue?"" Not in Half-Baked R-Rated Comedy Land it doesn't. All you need is a few locations on standby, a general idea of the plot you want (heroes journey, the rebirth, rags to riches etc.) and a couple of willing actors willing to chew the scenery and improvise their way through. No need for comedic setups and payoffs when you got game actors, willing to make funny noises and find ever more creative ways to say the word ""c**k"". Also make sure to have basic coverage in every scene and get some establishing shots on your way to set. Don't worry the editor will find the film in post.Now let's take on Bad Moms specifically and see what makes it tic. Firstly in today's day-and-age it's very in vogue to appeal to women. We've come along way since The Sweetest Thing (2002); thus films in general, but comedies especially need to address the lingering frustrations of working women in the best way two dudes who wrote The Hangover trilogy (2009-2013) can. Again it's frightfully easier than it sounds. Just envision a permanently besieged female protagonist whose life resembles a Family Feud (1999-Present) survey where the the question is ""What are the biggest complaints your wife has."" Then make the answer to those growing frustrations ""f**k it!"" because let's face it, chicks are basically men without penises.And of course, if you find yourself questioning your directorial decisions. If you feel a light and dishonest treatment of the real problems of division of household labor, child-rearing, life-work balance and generational entitlement is just too glib; remember the acronym BARP. It stands for Booze, Attitude, Recreational Drugs, and Partaaay with emphasis on the taaaay! Just because comedy can be a force for change doesn't mean it should be. The raucous screams of vodka soaked party-goers will do just as well.",Bad Moms
48,Screen_Blitz,"It's funny, joyful, and surprisingly smart amidst the unapologetic R-rated raunchiness",7,2 March 2017,"Not too many can deny that being a parent is hard, but nonetheless rewarding. It is rare however, that many films thoroughly tackle the hardships of parenthood without falling the pit of mawkish sentimentality. This comedy directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Morre and written by the men behind 'The Hangover' is one of those rare entries that tackles smartly on parenthood while poking fun at the hardships of family values. This film continues on the long string of films revolving around figures who are normally expected to act as role models engage in reckless and inappropriate behavior as a means for outrageous comedic appeal. Billy Bob Thornton did this with 'Bad Santa', Cameron Diaz did this with 'Bad Teacher', Johnny Knoxville did this 'Bad Grandpa', it's an ongoing trend in the genre that never fails to pull cinephiles into theaters. Unlike these entries, this comedy pedals on this theme with something more thoughtful behind the volcanic R-rated vulgarity. This film stars Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell, a frustrated mother who's constantly overwhelmed by taking care of her two children, holding her job at a coffee factory, attending PTA meetings hosted by a bossy PTA president Gwendolyn James (played by Christina Applegate), and being a housewife for everyone including her incompetent and unfaithful husband (played by David Walton). After an entire day gone wrong, Amy has decided she's finally had enough and forms a pact with her two friends Kiki (played Kristin Bell) and Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn) to cut down on their motherly responsibilities and party like mad. This eventually puts her under a crossfire by the PTA president.There is certainly nothing new offered beyond it's following the average raunchy comedy formula. That is definitely not to say however, that this film fails to shed on light on some thoughtful themes of parenthood in the midst of the constant stream of vulgar dialogue. The film is quite honest and understandable how difficult it is raise children while balancing your career and other responsibilities. This leaves room to some surprising heartwarming moments that come about in and out of the story. By the end, it opens the door to a message about how being a good mother does not require you to be a perfect one -- as opposed to Christina Applegate's character who showers her PTA members with a notion that perfection is the only key to successful parenthood. Surrounding the sweet substance however, is an extravagant level of raunchiness that is a staple for R-rated comedies. The three lead actresses Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, and Kristen Bell indulge in a endless vulgar sex jokes and genital jokes, and run rampant on F-bombs nearly every minute they appear on screen. Most of the humor is funny and enough to evoke good laughter, there are a few jokes however that fall either fall flat or a bit distasteful. Nonetheless, these actresses blossom with some sweet chemistry and comedic appeal. Following her disastrous role in sci-fi flop 'Jupiter Ascending', this marks an surprising return for Mila Kunis in the comedic territory since her outing in Seth MacFarlane's 'Ted' back in 2012, only that movie didn't give her much of a chance of exercise her comedic talent. Christina Applegate also delivers a fair of comedic flair but perhaps not enough to stand out against the main trio.Bad Moms is a wild comedy driven with plenty of laughter and a smart, heartwarming message that places it's three lead actresses on a fun, if flawed comedic ride. Although it's not consistently funny, it at least offers a sweet taste of comedic flair that will likely please many entreating for a clever, raunchy comedic vehicle.",Bad Moms
49,RforFilm,Parents will probably find Bad Moms funny. I found it hit or miss,5,2 August 2016,"Parents are never perfect. They are bound by nature to make mistakes. I can't count how many times my parents would either not care that I had a big homework thing due in the morning, that I had an event in front of another, or that I even had the right meal for dinner. Even with that imperfection, I still believe that nothing is perfect and that I was raised well. What surprises me is that I used to think that moms had high standards when I was a kid. Judging my how my little cousins parents are, it turns out that I was a part of the Dark Age.My aunt not only puts a lot of time in volunteering at her kids events, but will go out of the way to make sure that none of their food includes gluten, GTN, BTM, and what ever kids are not supposed to eat these days. I may be a parent, but I think it's safe to say that I lived, and so did my parents and their parents. I understand to good intentions of books that want the best for the next generation, but common instinct has always been my driving force. That seems to be the case for Bad Moms. Amy Mitchel (played by Mila Kunis) is a young mom of two pre-teens who tries her hardest to juggle being a top PTA mother, a part time executive for a boss younger then her, and a husband that's more interested in being a third child then a caring spouse. After a very bad day that would cause most people to snap, she finally cannot take it anymore when PTA president Gwendolyn (played by Christina Applegate) calls in an emergency two hour meeting just to talk about how great of a leader she is. Amy storms out of the PTA meeting, taking along fellow stressed out mother Kiki (played by Kristen Bell) to a bar where they find the more rebellious single mother Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn). Its there they all agree to simply stop trying their hardest and to simple enjoy their lives. For Amy, this means no more preparing all her kids meals, no more doing their homework, and especially no more following orders from the PTA. Gwendolyn sees this defy as a major threat and attempts to sabotage Amy's children in school. In retaliation, Amy decides to run for PTA president to finally dethrone the perfect mother. The marketing for Bad Moms have tried to play it off as a female The Hangover, though the story suggests this more as a parent version of Office Space. Both Office Space and Bad Moms have the similar theme of going against the social norms and the latter honestly does fine at it. The script does allow a lot of criticism for the current obsession for mothers that try too hard to follow the Martha Stewarts (who has a cameo in this) and the Pintrest copycats.Our three stars have plenty of moments where they got a laugh out of me. Mila Kunis may seem like a young choice for a mother of two, but it is cleverly explained that she had to adapt young. So with a good setup and some funny actresses, where does this go wrong? Simply, a bunch of the jokes don't fire. I always mention that comedies are hard to do as they require good scripts and the right performers to deliver them, and only half of the time did I chuckle. Bad Moms might be funnier if I had children, but I still feel like they could have gone darker with the material.I'll give this five Pintrest lists out of ten. Bad Moms will probably find an easy audience with mothers who can relate to the problems they face. Maybe even some men as well. It simply just wasn't for me. I can only say that for subjective reasons, you simply have to think Office Space and parenting and figure out if you'll like this or not.",Bad Moms
50,tbills2,These Moms are so Bad...oh you get it.,5,26 March 2018,"Mila Kunis would be an awesome mom. That's weird to say. She's way, way too attractive to me to view her as a mom. And we're close to the same age. Plus I wouldn't trade my mom in for anyone. You know how important family is to me... But if I was reborn and I had to pick a new mom, I'd go with Mila. WTF did I just say? Kristen Bell is crazy pretty and she is definitely pretty enough to play a princess. I do not understand why people would say that she isn't. Well, yeah I do actually but it's so not true! WTF did I just say? Kathryn Hayn is going way up on my hot scale after watching Bad Moms. WTF did I just say? Christina Applegate FINALLY has fulfilled her full funny potential in Bad Moms. I mean that. I love Christina and I've always seen a lot of her work and genuinely thought that she should be funnier on screen. Well she is laugh out loud hilarious in Bad Moms. Finally you sexy momma! I'm gonna crush on Christina hard for the rest of my life. WTF did I just say? Jada Pinkett Smith is a slutty mom in Bad Moms. WTF did she just say? Annie Mumolo is real pretty but she's new to me so I don't know WTF to say. Mila is a great lead in a comedy. Bad Moms is funnier than I expected and a little raunchier.

There is an interesting sequence with the real moms over the end credits.Like pasta to the face, not every joke sticks, but enough of them hit the target.

52,bankofmarquis,Above Average Comedy,7,18 September 2016,"BAD MOMS is a gross-out comedy that follows the typical formula for these types of films but twists it to put females in the leads. It also is executed at a much higher level than one gets typically from these types of films, which makes it an enjoyable film experience.The always watchable Mila Kunis stars as Amy a working mom who is trying to do it all while trying to keep up with the seemingly perfect head of PTA (a stony Christina Applegate). When her marriage breaks- up, she falls into the company of the mousy Kiki (a solid Kristin Bell) and the over-the-top Carla (Kathryn Hahn in a break-out performance). They decide that, instead of trying to be the PERFECT moms they will be BAD MOMS (see what they did there?) and hilarity ensues.Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore - two writers of THE HANGOVER - this film checks similar boxes as that one. Center around a ""normal"" person in a strained relationship who's just trying to get by? Check Add a mousy friend who (eventually) will become the Mouse That Roared? Check. Mix in the wild and crazy friend that we will find has a heart? Check. Love interest for the lead? Check Outrageous situations, crass language and sex jokes? Check, Check and CHECK!With all that, you would think that this is a middle of the road, mediocre movie - and it isn't, it's something more. So why? I think the energy that the Directors and Stars brings to this elevates what could have been a ""by-the-numbers"" comedy into something more. The three leads are well cast. Kunis brings sincerity and reality to her character, Bell a sweetness and naivete while Hahn steals the first half of this film with her over-the- topness that always stops just short of getting on your nerves. Add to these performances Applegate's PTA President gives you someone to root against and a very funny cameo by Martha Stewart and the ingredients are there.But, for me, the real heroes of this film are the Directors. They, obviously, know this type of film genre well and clip this film along at a brisk pace, never lingering on anything and knowing when to get off a joke before it gets too old. They teetered on the verge of going on to long with the montage in the grocery store (a montage that is well represented in the trailer) but, for the most part, moves things along well.A very entertaining night at the movies, though I would recommend going with buddies, not your spouse or children. There will be some uncomfortable moments - and that's a funny, good thing.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Bad Moms
53,Ruskington,The title is half right I guess,3,17 April 2020,A truly awful cast coupled with the usual unimaginative writing stumbling through every cliche in the Hollywood book.The idea that Mila Kunis is a desperate singleton who can't get a man because of her 'mom-bra' is an insult to the viewer and reason enough to turn this nonsense off.

55,bob-the-movie-man,Inconsistent laughs in a comedy of parental duty,5,19 August 2016,"Penned by the writers of ""The Hangover"" (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore), this was a film I went into with really, really low expectations. But it was better than I expected it to be.Mila Kunis (which we already know means ""Fine"" in Navajo) plays Amy, a normal working Mum (albeit clearly living in a hugely affluent neighbourhood) with a no-good husband and two kids. Amy is at the end of her tether, and as parents haven't we all been there? After one particularly dreadful day she uncharacteristically heads for a bar and forms a firm friendship with hen-pecked wife and Mum Kiki (an excellent Kristen Bell) and the potty-mouthed and kick-ass Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Making a pact to not follow convention they decide to be ""Bad Moms"" which brings them into direct conflict with Gwendoline (""Anchorman""'s Christina Applegate), the tyrannical head of the school Parent Teacher Association and her fawning sidekicks Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith, ""Matrix"" sequels) and Vicky (Annie Mumulo, ""Bridesmaids""). As attacks get personal, Amy is forced into standing against Gwendoline for the PTA chair and a battle royale ensues.From the film's publicity, I expected this to be a ""3 go mad in Vegas"" style of romp, but it didn't head in that direction. True that there is one very funny and well-cut scene of craziness in a supermarket (""Kids, we're going to have to find a new supermarket""), but the film has a more thoughtful tone reflecting as it does the stresses on working parents exacerbated by the need to conform to social mores.It would be dangerous at this point for me, as a man, to appear sexist and misogynist, so I will quote (and credit) my wife here in commenting that the film is like a ""Next Generation"" movie to 1987's Diane Keaton vehicle ""Baby Boom"". In that film Keaton's character has to juggle a corporate working life with unexpected child rearing: something still relatively unusual in those days (yes folks, things have changed a LOT for the better in 30 years). ""Bad Moms"" skims forward to today when being a working parent is almost a given, but the characters in the film view that maybe that swing has gone too far - that there is not enough time for them to treasure and nurture their kids. Here the film does slip into sexist territory in featuring all the struggling ""Moms"" as predominantly female: the one single Dad (hunk and love interest Jay Hernandez) never seems stressed or out of his depth.So, there is a good concept in here, but to be honest it is not particularly well executed. Given that it is supposed to be a comedy, the limited laughs supplied are well distributed throughout the film. It's more of a smile-along than a laugh-along.The film is also pretty inconsistent in tone, flipping as it does from the leads being ""Bad Moms"" to being lovey-dovey ""aren't my kids adorable""parents. For a UK audience I would suggest that there is way, WAY too much sickly hugging of kids going on. And - without spoilers - the denouement at the ending is far from satisfying.On the plus side, it is technically well delivered, and looks like bloody Shakespeare compared to the truly execrable ""Dirty Grandpa"". The editing is slick and the music choice and music editing is particularly good. Some of the performances - especially those of Bell and Hahn - are great. And a particular nod to young Oona Laurence as Amy's daughter who carries her part really nicely.In terms of the lead, Mila Kunis wouldn't seem to be a natural choice for a comedy part, although her performance is kookily watchable (that might just be the ""fine"" influence on me). A low point however is a post-sex scene where Kunis appears to have been watching ABC News rather than doing any sort of strenuous horizontal jogging (not that my wife noticed this as she was MUCH too distracted by who was acting on the other side of the bed). If anyone puts together a top 10 of unconvincing movie sex scenes, this is a strong contender.Comedies are very personal things. Might this one be right for you? I would suggest that if you are not a parent, you should probably skip it and wait for the TV showing - - many of the situations are those that only parents who've been through the more hellish moments of child rearing will relate to! It's also not for the very prudish. There is a lot of bad language, a bit of nudity and drug references, although it doesn't quite descend to the same gross-out level comedy of ""The Hangover"" or a Farrelly brothers film.A final shout-out to the goofy final credits, done in ""When Harry Met Sally"" style, where the actresses real mothers talk about whether they were good mum's or not.

Going up against Jason Bourne was pretty ballsy let alone movies like Star Trek: Beyond or Ghostbusters. But the phrase ""counter programming"" comes to mind. Putting in a smaller movie with potential beside a juggernaut is slowly becoming more and more successful. The one that I remember first was Kingsman: The Secret Service being released against Fifty Shades of Grey and Kingsman performed really well despite all the attention that Fifty Shades got. It seems like the same strategy worked for Bad Moms, providing that alternative option for people who weren't interested in Bourne. After being disappointed with Ghostbusters, I'm really glad I got to see this, I laughed a lot and was impressed with what Bad Moms was able to do.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Amy (Mila Kunis) is a mom that has to do everything. Her two kids Jane and Dylan are completely dependent on her. She shuttles them to school, does their homework for them, and takes them to all their extra curricular activities. On top of this she works a part time job which is actually a full time job because her boss Dale (Clark Duke) completely takes advantage of her. Lastly, her deadbeat husband Mike (David Walton) is having an affair online and she kicks him out. She's completely under-appreciated and she also has to deal with the judgmental head of the PTA Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) and her cronies Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Vicky (Annie Mumolo).On the particular day we join her, she has a really terrible day and after they call an emergency PTA meeting where they go through what they can't put in items for the bake sale (trust me the list is just ridiculous). Amy decides to quit after being called out for being late to the meeting. She heads to a bar and bumps into Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Carla is the mom that no one wants to associate with, she ignores her kid and tries to bang the husbands of the other moms. Another mom shows up named Kiki (Kristen Bell) who followed Amy there. Kiki is the mom with 4 kids who doesn't have any time to herself and was inspired by Amy's speech. They drink together and bond over the difficulties of being a mom today. They decide to be bad moms and after a drunken trip to the grocery store, they resolve to try things a little differently going forward.Going into this movie if you see the trailers, it's not exactly the movie that gets advertised. It looks like something similar to The Hangover or 21 and Over (which Jon Lucas and Scott Moore also wrote and directed) and while the movie is pretty raunchy, I was surprised how much development went into Amy's character. There's more than a few scenes where you see Amy bonding with her kids and trying to do the right thing and it actually works pretty well. She's a good character, you're with her when she finally gets so sick of trying to keep up with these unrealistic goals and she never goes too far when she tries to teach her kids to be self-reliant. It can be hard for movies to strike that balance between dirty comedy and proper character development (Unfinished Business missed on it completely) but Bad Moms did a decent job with it.Getting into the actually comedy, there were so many laugh out loud moments. The language in it is pretty bad and they aren't afraid to say whatever they want or make fun of whatever they want. The upside is that for the majority of it, it mostly works. Does everything work 100%? No, you can tell there was a fair amount of ad libbing and not everything is the gold standard. I would say probably around 75% of the jokes made me laugh and for something that could have easily been a throwaway, for me it was more than enough.The real strength of Bad Moms is how well Mila, Kathryn and Kristen work together and they all give great performances. This is the best job I've seen Mila do in a comedy in a while. She has the chops to do the dramatic stuff too and although she initially seemed like odd casting, she was great. Kathryn Hahn finally found the right movie to showcase herself, she's the mouthiest and the loudest of the moms but she steals most scenes she's in. Kristen Bell played her role pitch perfect. I've talked about before how versatile she is, she probably could have played Mila's role but she hits the right notes and rounds out the main 3 well. Christina Applegate was also good as Gwendolyn, the movie gives her some humanity at the end which was a nice touch.I did have small problems with this movie. The whole subplot with Amy running to be the PTA president was a little corny and they make her husband Mike just such a loser it wasn't really believable. In the end though, this was a pretty solid comedy and it delivered on almost all fronts. I don't think a lot was expected from Bad Moms and I would congratulate the team behind it for delivering an impressive low-brow comedy for women that men can enjoy as well.",Bad Moms

It takes place in home where a mom, Ann (Mila Kunis) is stressed out with the hurried lives of her kids and disconnected husband. She also works bringing home the bacon in startup coffee company. She reaches a breaking point and enough is enough. She makes time to step back to help herself before she can help others. In the process she teams up with 2 other moms (Carla -Kathryn Hahn- Kiki -Kristen Bell- )and they make a trifecta coalition. Created a revolution for call of action for all moms. They are not going to take it anymore. A few touching scenes and this movie will definitely make you pause and thank your mother. As the saying goes, mothers could not be everywhere so that is why he created moms. You will laugh and cry in this movie and be more grateful for moms everywhere.",Bad Moms
62,CineMuseFilms,a lighthearted slapstick comedy on the shaming of stressed-out moms,6,17 August 2016,"The shaming of women is a global phenomenon that unfortunately is part of everyday life. Filmmakers, media and marketing industries prey on women's anxieties about their bodies, and motherhood is another favourite target. While the documentary Embrace (2016) calls out body shaming, the comedy Bad Moms (2016) calls out the impossible standards to which modern mothers are expected to conform. Laughter carries this message more effectively than polemic but make no mistake: while this film is funny it also has serious things to say. The plot line is all too familiar. Over-worked mom Amy (Mila Kunis) is always running between the needs of her spoilt two children, a lazy husband, a part-time job, homework, school rules, and endless extra-curricular activities. The kids are overscheduled, over-controlled and over-indulged, and like too many parents everywhere, the homework is for Amy. When she ditches the husband for having a cyber-sex affair her already chaotic world nears breaking point. That's when the pushy cabal of PTA perfect moms and yummy mummies insist on ever-more elaborate cake-bakes. When she publicly quits the PTA, the snobby dominatrix president Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) launches a vendetta against Amy and her kids. She retaliates by campaigning for president and the internecine warfare between mom camps escalate in hilarious ways. Deserted by the school, her nearest friends become her emotional anchors and all give themselves permission to party and carry on. While the story is predictable and at times corny, the underlying issues are totally real. The slapstick comedy softens the pointed message about just how powerless mothers are against the onslaught of unrealistic expectations. The bigger irony is that so many movies perpetuate the myth of the perfect mom without even questioning the existence of the perfect dad.This film is obviously targeted directly at stressed-out moms but dads should watch too. If nothing else, it exposes the gender inequality that persists in parenting and the bigger injustice of 'perfect moms' shaming other moms for not meeting politically correct standards. When Amy gives her election speech and confesses all the ways she is a bad mom she starts a sisterhood chorus of bad moms all needing to offload their guilt about the things they have not done for their children. While it's always possible to find aspects of a film that could have been made better, this film deserves praise for going in to bat for the most honourable profession on the planet.",Bad Moms

64,LloydBayer,"Crude yet hilarious, Bad Moms is immensely watchable thanks to its supporting cast.",6,3 August 2016,"Who needs Cyndi Lauper when you have Kathryn Hahn – the main reason why Bad Moms is a fun film for women of all ages. These girls have a lot of fun, as do we, but make no mistake; this isn't a chick flick in the conventional sense.That's the imprint any male member of the audience will walk away with. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, Bad Moms isn't a soapy sitcom, nor a romantic comedy or a date movie. There are plenty of other films catering to that need (Me Before You being the recent most popular girlie movie). Instead, the approach is in its sincere message that there's no such thing as a perfect family. And spinning this message into a hilarious farce is the second reason – the fact that the story was scripted by Jon Lucas and Scott More, the same guys who first wrote The Hangover, an outrageous guys-only comedy. Surprisingly, and as men writing this story, their insight echoes the plight of struggling soccer moms as the hardest job in the world. One such case is that of Amy (Mila Kunis), a young mom living out of her minivan while juggling work, kids, and marriage. Making things worse are the so called 'perfect moms' led by super rich PTA president Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) and her sidekick Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith). A good thirty minutes goes by where Amy wears the face of almost every mom watching this film. Then, buckled by the weight of her world crumbling down, and increasing harassment from Gwendolyn and crew, Amy finally snaps. Enter Hahn and Kristen Bell, fellow moms to Amy's rescue.What follows is an infinite assortment of gags, both whimsy and slapstick, but squarely rooted in crude comic territory. While the premise isn't really original (Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher comes to mind), and the shenanigans they get up to are reminiscent of previous films, the payoff is in the well-earned laughs. We owe this in no small part to Hahn, who once again steals the show every time she is on screen and the main reason why Bad Moms is immensely watchable. Prepare for loose-lipped one-liners, frequent F-bombs, multiple references to other films and TV shows (don't miss the short but hilarious stab at Creed), and before you know it, you end up watching a raunchy film about motherhood; If that makes any sense. Even so, the icing on the cake is the ensuing sorority row between Gwendolyn and Amy, resulting in the latter running for PTA president. After Hahn's promiscuous antics, Applegate is the exact opposite but the icy itch with a capital B that we all love to hate.More coarse language and an outrageous party later, and you get the notion that this may have never been intended as a chick flick. Sure, this is one wild film for a girl's night out but not one to be underestimated by the discerning male audience. There's plenty to keep everyone knee-slapped yet it never gets overly gross to the point that even Martha Stewart would find tasteless. So ditch those fictitious superhero films for a change and watch this film instead, for no other reason than that the fact that Bad Moms ,in the end, is nothing but real superheroes disguised as mothers.",Bad Moms
65,diac228,The True Feminism Film of Summer 2016,8,15 August 2016,"Ghostbusters was slaughtered and fed to the wolves in terms of box office because the feminist twang to the franchise was not well-received in the least bit. Some complained it was pointless, some complained it was just milking a franchise that is heavy in nostalgia, and others complained that it was pandering to the female-driven audience as opposed to the fanbase that had supported the franchise in the first place. Despite the good critic reviews, it became a major loss for Sony, and killed any hopes for a sequel.Bad Moms on the other hand is the little summer film that could, taking a $20 million budget and already matching that amount after the first weekend. And with strong word-of-mouth and good reviews it continues to make decent money in a crowded summer schedule. This film also has a heavy feminism touch, yet hasn't received the male-bashing you've been seeing from Ghostbusters. And that's because the film from the ground up was made for moms, made for female millennials, and doesn't hold anything back and keeps the focus on the ladies.Led by the screen writing duo that penned the clever original Hangover flick, Bad Moms is a cinematic stress ball for mothers around the world. It follows a trio of ladies fed up with their stressful lives and start rebelling against the norm. It starts a revolution amongst the community which counters the strict clockwork ways of the PTA---leading to a culture clash against its leader. The plot isn't anything drastically revolutionary, but it has a lot to say about modern society's difficult expectations for mothers.With the plot being slightly thin, it gives plenty of room for the main cast to go vulgar, go nuts, go raw, before ultimately getting the point across. And Kunis, Kristin Bell, and especially Kathryn Hahn knocks it out of the park with timing, delivery, and a good range of emotions to boot. Mila Kunis' character rises from humble soccer mom into a wild force of nature that results in crazy parties, rebellion against her children and deadbeat husband, and even nachos for breakfast (my hero). Step aside men as most of the focus was on the relationships between mother and child, with men popping in only once in a while. Then toss several funny scenarios, a wild cheap wine scene, and a couple fun cameos, and you'll be seldom bored at the chaos that emerges once the second act rolls in.This movie definitely isn't perfect. The tone gets slightly uneven, the soundtrack is overindulgent, and the final moments doesn't quite match the comedic wrecking ball of the second half, but if you are a mother this is your guilty pleasure. The cast is too fun, the movie doesn't slow down, and it gets unapologetically vulgar and uncut and doesn't let go.Mothers: Bad Moms tailors to you, speaks to you, represents you, and challenges societal beliefs held against you. And prepare for the final scene once the credits roll in---it wraps up the motherhood themes perfectly. You can't just switch genders on a film and try to staple a feminism theme and expect it to work---you need to fully commit to your audience and also explain what your 21st century movement is all about. Otherwise it feels like a gimmick. Ghostbusters was simply trying to ride the wave of feminism. Bad Moms actually has something to say, which is why ultimately amongst the flaws and hard-R rating it actually works.",Bad Moms
66,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,29 August 2016,"Pushed to the limit of possible stress by her husband's laziness, her terrible boss, her unpaid over time hours, two kids, constant unbearable scrutiny from Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), head of the PTA and an overall tireless schedule, Amy (Mila Kunis) one night decides with her new found friends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) to rebel to the system and to finally let themselves go, embarking in a journey of transgression. Having never been a fan of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in the comedy scene I have to admit that this is definitely their best and most mature effort in feature comedy yet, even if is still bears signs of their usual over-stuffed and slightly uncomfortable humor. In contrast with these writers and directors' previous film I found myself genuinely laughing along with the movie many times and ultimately the success of a comedy comes down to that so no matter how off the rails they go at times, this film is definitely the most tight and coherent film these filmmakers have put together yet. The characters, whilst slightly stereotypical and sporadically going off balance, for the major part maintain an empathetic through line which ultimately, no matter how many clichés the film bumps into, results in a satisfying experience with a very strong thematic undercurrent about what it means to be a mom and how mad and out of control the situation can be. More importantly the film is also about how people unjustly and stupidly judge each other and whilst both these themes might be shoved down your throat towards the end, through the film they are carried out in an organic way, giving the characters something to do and getting out comedy from the hilarious situations that emerge. Highlights of the cast for me have to be Kristen Bell for her usual brilliant timing and charisma and Oona Laurence who continues to nail every performance through and through. This kid is a natural. Another element for which the directors have never distinguished themselves is style and personal touch. Whilst this film carries on that, being shot in the most generic way possible, having absolutely zero shots that stick out as anything but standard coverage, they do get away hilariously with a couple of sequence which benefit from having some really wild and out-there humor and not taking that to the same level of crassness that some of their previous efforts had, resulting in uncomfortable stuff, being there just for the sake of provocation. Here instead, they just nail that balance of shocking you, yet keeping it in tone and genuine, which produced the opposite result: a couple of hilarious sequences of anarchic comedy that had me bursting out with joy and laughter. They really managed to nail those moments of pure joy which I really find beautiful in a comedy. Where unfortunately they fail is in keeping the pathos going throughout all the scenes and have many scenes which feel more like connective character tissue or exposition rather than part of the film. Not to mention that I was kind of turned off by the movie at times for the usual, unpleasant moral ambiguity that Moore and Lucas have had many times in the past: having all the characters just fly off in a billionaire's jet at the end really bothered me, especially for how unnecessary it felt. Fortunately those moments happen rarely and quickly, for the majority we are served a pretty decent comedy with a couple of great moments, some admittedly dull, but overall a very good and likable cast and a fine amount of laughs.",Bad Moms
67,coreyjdenford,"Mom, you're fun.",6,25 August 2016,"This is my review of Bad Moms (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith, Anna Mumolo.Plot: Amy (Kunis), is a mother of two and her workaholic lifestyle has made her kids fall out of love with her, so she tries to find a way to make her life better by meeting Carla (Hahn), and Kiki (Bell), the three of them become friends and Amy does things that she wouldn't normally. But as life gets more bliss for her, her children's lives go in a downward spiral. Can she pick up the pieces make their family life better?Bad Moms certainly isn't the best comedy this year but it is still a fun one, writer/director duo Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writing team behind the hangover trilogy whether it be the quick-witted and hilarious first movie or the clunky, unfunny and rushed sequels this is just another strong addition to their ever-expanding comedy career. However the pair keep their quick-witted antics from the first Hangover and transfer them to this mainly because of what happens throughout the film. Mila Kunis who has had several strong performances we all know her as Meg from T.V's Family Guy but what is she like on the silver screen? And also is she as good as her laugh out loud in bear-comedy Ted? On the silver screen Kunis is a strong performer with funny moments and a lot of people say that her best performance was in Ted. In this Kunis stars as Amy a workaholic mom who is deprived out of love from her two children and her deadbeat boyfriend who has one hell of a secret that he is hiding from her, she finds out that he has a secret girlfriend. You could say that Amy is lost in the world of work; however that isn't what makes her life bad she is in a dead-end job that has been voluntary for so many years and she is forever antagonized by Christina Applegate's Gwendolyn, the president of the P.T.A and she is forever going on about how she is so much better than Amy. So as life goes in a downward spiral she meets Carla (Hahn, in top form), a rowdy single mother of one who only wants to do one thing and that is drink heavily and party hard and alongside her Kiki (Bell, in top form after her disappointing appearance in The Boss) a mother who is in the same ball pit as Amy, with a husband that won't do anything that involves getting his hands dirty. And from there Amy's life gets better.Although inspired by the Hangover series what the men do in that, the three moms do in this they go out to drink heavily and party hard, this still keeps the same traits as the Hangover trilogy however a lot more fun the rushed sequels. There is one scene in this which could be described as the funniest scene in the entire film, and that when the trio get ready to go out, which involves Amy's 'sexy' bra a jerk off scene involving Kiki's hooded top ""I am never wearing this again"" she says in shock after said scene, and it leads to them going to one place where they can party hard, a supermarket then we get into the set piece of the film it's rare for a comedy to have set-pieces but it's there, a scene that pops out from any other part of the film. It includes trips, slides, and falls and also milk tipping, along with slow-motion style laughs and after all this Amy becomes something she never dreamed of to be a fun mom however that does not make her kids love her even more. Not only does Amy have a pose so does Gwendolyn, and her two friends Stacy (Pinkett-Smith, not a lovable character not like Gloria in the Madagascar trilogy), even more bad-ass and bitchy than ever, and also Vicky (Mumolo) whose a little bit and quite frankly she likes what Amy is doing.Things take a turn for the worse for Amy as Gwendolyn tries to take over her life and Amy cannot be bothered to do anything again however it does get slightly better after that, when the P.T.A elections come round and everybody goes to Gwendolyn's at first but then they discover that she is boring and everybody just wants to have fun, so the three form an election party and again the Hangover style takes its toll. However Amy soon learns that she has to fight fire with fire she tries to beat Gwendolyn at her own game, and it is almost successful until Amy loses her drift and again things take a turn for the worse. However the scene when Carla and Kiki try to convince Amy that she is a good person and mother is surprisingly enjoyable filled with laughs and moments that may make you cry, along with scene when Gwendolyn realizes what kind of person she really is and all that she tries to beat Amy when she should have been looking in the mirror that moment is very enjoyable, after that things get better for Amy as her life goes uphill from there even Gwendolyn starts to like her. In conclusion this is a really fun and hilarious adult comedy that will ambush you with laughs, rudeness and wild parties a very funny adult comedy that even be a contender for one of the best comedies this year but it's still slightly patchy in areas.Verdict: Drinking, laughs and wild parties Bad Moms is a fun yet patchy comedy filled with laughs and joy and even your mom will be laughing at this. One of the best and most interesting this year.6/10 fun and hilarious.",Bad Moms

The premise look fine, women having a bad day and wanting to be bad moms, but from the opening minute I knew I made a poor choice.The actresses never seemed real rather that they were friends or they liked each other. They seemed to deliver their lines poorly and never conveyed emotions with their body or face. The plot was very shallow and nothing seemed natural or organic. At no point did these females seem like friends and it felt like a bunch of badly written and acted skits. They simply were put together and that is it. There is NO reason for them to come together or even hang out.This movie took a lot of shots at men. This felt like Liberal PC Hollywood, pushing their agenda. There was a White male reference who thinks he is special and deserves everything. Kid you not and lazy dads. Similar to Ghostbusters 2016, this movie was about how smart women are, and how easy the life of men are and men are idiots. This felt like feminism, mixed with Liberalism in an effort to shame men and pat women on the back for having the Golden Vajayjay. Even the love story thrown it was absolutely awful.I cannot recommend this movie. I come to the conclusion, being funny is a man's trait. Evolution is a big reason why and no matter what Hollywood tells you, their is a reason why most funny women look and act like men. This movie was a 5 out of 10.",Bad Moms
70,gavinp9,Light and breezy fun,7,2 January 2018,"'Bad Moms' (not sure why the spelling wasn't changed in Australia, like 'Bad Neighbours' was - lazy work, distributors) is a straightforward comedy, delivering what it should - easy laughs with not much seriousness. The irony is that the film was written and directed by two men... Amy (Kunis - the standout star here) is a mother of two, juggling all the chores and school drop-offs with a job and a disintegrating marriage. She semi-loses it when Gwendolyn (Applegate), the uptight PTA president, pushes her too far and challenges for the PTA leadership so all the mums have less stress and things to worry about in their lives.Kiki (Bell) is good as the repressed mother of four, but single mum Carla (Hahn) really steals the show, with her attitude and wisecracks. The montage when they go to the shops on their first night out together is gold. The other cast get some time, but not much, so it's really these three vs Applegate. The kids are good, but don't have much impact either.The soundtrack's crap, but there's a message in here somewhere. It's not that raunchy or dirty - except for a few moments - but does have way more laughs than I was expecting. Kunis is funny, sensitive, looks exceptional and carries the film.

But while the set up was working all right for me, I probably am too old for the drunk jokes fest this film has turned to in its entire mid section. The auditorium around me was roaring with laughter, and I didn't even smile faintly. It does seem to be one of the hot trends around. But while I still find Buster Keaton or Chaplin hilarious when playing drunk, none of the drunk stunts of the film seemed funny to me. Moreover, the script itself leaves a whole lot to be desired. On the other hand, Mila Kunis is great (she usually is) and she does have one of the very few real characters written down for her. Kristen Bell is breathing some life into a very poorly written cartoon, and Christina Applegate, is simply superb. Her role is a simple one dimensional cartoon, and she makes it flesh and blood.

Focusing on a single character when the title is plural, they leave out the two supporting characters that shine when they are in frame.

Especially under the watchful eye of the impeccable mothers Jada Pinkett Smith, Annie Mumolo (well maybe not so much Mumolo) and uber bitch Christina Applegate who happens to be head of the PTA. Things go from bad to worse for Kunis and she snaps, going from trying her damn best to breaking all the rules and forms an unlikely alliance with not-so-ideal moms Kathryn Hahn who is outrageously crazy and has the best lines of the movie and fellow Sarah Marshall star, Kristen Bell who's the innocent, under-the-thumb mum that needs to break free and grow some balls. The only common traits they share is the mothering instinct for their children and the hatred of trying to be perfect moms. We see a more human Jay Hernandez than his recent Diablo from Suicide Squad and I was quite happy to see Kick-Ass' Clark Duke playing an immature and demanding boss, someone else Kunis had to mother. But it's massive shout out to Oona Lawrence, who plays the highly-strung daughter, obsessed with being on the soccer team and in real life, who happens to be in two major releases at the cinema at the same time; the other being Pete's Dragon. You go girl! It boasts an superb soundtrack with current dance tracks from Demi Lovato, Icona Pop and DNCE, especially the supermarket sweep scene and the sorority party, the craziness from Hangover really shines through. It's quite long and while it gets a little cheesy towards the end, it still projects a good underlining message, same kind of feel good feeling I experienced from Crazy, Stupid, Love and there's a nice touch during the end credits with the stars own real life mothers joining them on the couch sharing their own experiences at motherhood. It's funny, entertaining and certainly one of the better comedies I've seen this year. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Point: 10 for the end credit sofa moms, supermarket sweep and therapist Wanda Sykes. 79% 8/10",Bad Moms
83,plasticanimalz,Bad Moms?,5,8 November 2016,"Bad Moms, Bad Teacher, Bad Girls - why whenever woman want independence they're bad? The Hangover wasn't called Bad Groomsmen. How about Bad Script, Bad Directing. The women's improving was the only thing that made this movie funny or watchable. I seriously felt like the writers took an old, formulaic, paint-by-numbers script and typed the actresses names into it, or that they wrote it in 3 days, tops. I thought it was funny they heavy-handed male entitlement in the film to the point where I thought they were actually mocking the women, but this poor script and directing is the perfect example of white male entitlement thinking they can just crank out a script about women and mothers with seemingly zero knowledge and call it a day. This was a poor excuse to compete with Sisters. Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn were the only thing to give this any humor or life and this film would be a 2 without them. Mila is likable even if the writers and directors did not give the women much to work with, particularly Applegate and Jada's identical, one- dimensional characters. Their talents were severely neglected and underused.I'm not saying men can't write or direct women. Obviously there are some ""talented"" men who can identify with others and walk in their shoes, like Paul Feig or Nicholas Sparks. But assigning two men who write Juvenile guy humor into poorly crafted scripts probably don't remotely know the first thing about women. I seriously wondered how many times Mila, Applegate or Pinkett felt embarrassed to be in this movie.",Bad Moms
84,skullhead739,"Hilarious movie, okay story and great cast",7,31 August 2020,"I seriously can believe how much bad reviews im seeing of this film?The cast is full of A listers that do great in there charismatic roles. There's the main 3 best friends that are really different to each other but funny in there own ways. Then 3 sort of villain moms that do a great job of making you hate them but also add to the darker humor of things. All other cast members were memorable and added there piece to the puzzle but i will say some of the male depictions are pretty chessy, cliche and somewhat sexist but that never took away too of the film for me at least. Some of the mom scenes and acting are also cringey from time to time but again it wasn't that bad.Story:
The plot isn't the most unique and it is very cheesy and cliche but overall I really enjoyed it! Im sure lots of parents can relate to this film and even non parents can appreciate the comedic struggles. This has a good balance between problem, character development, and resolving the problem with a finale of the happy ending. I thought the mix between the real world struggles and the charismatic cast with great jokes here and there was fun to just sit back and laugh at. Your not getting a oscar winning plot here but I think a interesting and funny take on parenthood. I will say some scenes are a bit bogus, cringe, and is trying a bit too hard. but hence why this isn't a 10/10. Overall pretty dang enjoyable plot.Summary:
I would highly reccomend this film to anyone looking for a funny relaxed weekend flick. Its not perfect but I dont think it was trying to be.",Bad Moms

I think that her character was the most interesting in the entire movie. Christina Applegate was also really really good!I enjoyed the part in the end of the movie where the main cast members talk together with their mothers. This part was really sweet and it's worth watching. Although the movie greatly exaggerates the life of a working mom, it does so in order to point out specific aspects of our behavior and it does a decent job as far as I am concerned.

87,dale-51649,"Stressed Moms blow off steam, make asses of themselves",1,17 November 2016,"Unfunny movie starring three miscast actresses. The story involves three Moms who feel over stressed and decide to blow off steam in an unconventional way. It is filled with unfunny jokes that the trio can't seem to ""pull off"" (no pun intended) , without looking self conscious . When this occurs the audience cannot help but feel self conscious themselves, so there is a lot of squirming.The best example of this type of uncomfortable humor is when Kathryn Hahn delivers penis joke lines that are bawdy, but go over like a led balloon. It doesn't help that she scrunches up that FACE to the point that her eyes disappear completely, either. If a beautiful actress delivered the lines it might have been different, but Kathryn Hahn? Hollywoods "" go to"" girl to play the homely friend? I don't mean it in a bad way, but Kathryn Hahn making penis jokes is like if Adrian Brody was cast to deliver lines about cliteromegaly; Awkward!

They would break away from their roles and be ""bad girls"" for a day and that would bring balance back to the force.I didn't mind the cliché however the humor here is really either hit or miss. You'll either stare in silence at the screen going ""what? was that supposed to be a joke? It looked painful/offensive/silly"" then there are the jokes that land and those are really funny in comparison... they don't happen often enough to cover for the bad jokes though.Harmless enough of a movie if there is nothing else on but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",Bad Moms

Bad moms has nice and funny actresses: Mila Kunis as Amy, Kathryn Hahn as Carla, Kristen Bell as Kiki and Christina Applegate as Gwendolyn. It is accepted fact that moms are great and moms have a tough time taking care of their kids. When things get out of control and stress levels are way too high, Amy , Kiki and Carla bond. The bonding between them is so strong, alcohol is swallowed with ease and simplification of differences between circumcised men and uncircumcised men is elaborated in fun filled language. Kathryn Hahn is hysterical with her explanation and Kristen Bell as naive homemaker is wild with happiness just to be with her new friends. The movie is definitely not Oscar worthy but it is fun.

92,WatchedAllMovies,Thin on the plot,5,10 December 2016,"This looks like a movie intended for bored housewives.Unfortunately, the movie itself is also boring. There is a thin plot line -- a few moms unsatisfied with their lives as housewives decided to rebel and have fun. It just so happen there's a convenient villain to give them a target to focus on -- a president of PTA who is a bully.Even with this new focus, the plot is still too thin to fill a full length movie. What gives this away is that the PTA party scene drags on for too long with no purpose.I was watching this movie while playing a game on my tablet. Usually this makes a boring movie more tolerable, but it couldn't save this movie. Not even Martha Stewart could save it. I stopped watching after the party scene. If there is a brilliant plot twists after this, I totally miss it.This may work better if they cut it down to one hour.",Bad Moms

The overall concept of the movie was fine, but I just couldn't get over how much they relied on crude humor to drive the funny moments in this movie, which don't get me wrong, it did have funny moments. I also didn't necessarily think that the relationship aspect with the new ""boyfriend"" was really all that pivotal to the plot if you took him completely out of the movie, nothing changes.I watched it, now I can store this one as a ""yeah I've seen it"".",Bad Moms
94,untilnow99,Not a bad way to spend a couple hours,8,6 August 2016,"First of all, I would caution females against seeing this with their boyfriends/lovers/husbands. I felt that there were more than a few times that my spontaneous need to laugh out loud was restricted by the fact that my long-term boyfriend was sitting next to me. There were far too many sexist jokes made re: men, men being big babies, men's penises and so on; jokes that I don't think a great many men will appreciate, no matter how confident they are with their own sexuality and penile attributes. My significant other is someone who is funny as hell himself, but rarely RARELY laughs at others' jokes or any kind of comedy. However, with this film I noticed he had a hard time suppressing his guffaws at several of the jokes made. And, yes, there is plenty to laugh at in this movie.SPOILER ALERT, BIG TIME: I don't want to write anything that will give away any of the many, many great one-liners. Just let me say that, at one point in the movie, I was astounded at how foot-stompingly, crowing-out-loud-with-laughter funny one of the scenes was. Completely shocking, too, and, if your male partner is still ""intact,"" ---- look it up if you don't get what I mean--- then PLEASE don't take him to see this flick. I thought it was RIOTOUSLY HILARIOUS, but I don't think he will see the humor in it----at all.All of the lead women in this film are women I like. Mila Kunis was terrific, but it was Kathryn Hahn as ""Carla"" who really stole the show. She overshadowed everyone with her performance, and not just because she had most of the best lines, either.As far as the profanity went, I found it a bit overdone. Tiresome, in fact. I know saying ""fuck"" a lot is oh-so hip now, but sometimes less is more, definitely. Use your big, more clever words, script writers. Thank you.I looked up Jay Hernandez (""Jessie"") and was surprised to find that in reality he is only 5'8"" (and 1/2""!) tall. Somehow he was made to tower over women who must be nearly 5'8"" themselves. Hollywood magic. Please go see this movie with your girlfriends. You will be entertained.",Bad Moms
95,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 91,9,19 August 2016,"Usually modern comedies have a difficult time building any kind of depth without either feeling forced or sacrificing its sense of humor in the process. Bad Moms, with the help of its strong cast, knows how to work around this.While it's not some highbrow character study, it shows all sides of the situation without making it obvious that it's using a traditional path to get there.Bad Moms stars Mila Kunis as Amy, a mother of two who gets absolutely no help from her husband, who apparently likes the dog more than his own kids.Christina Applegate plays Amy's antagonist, Gwendolyn, who is president of the PTA and doesn't allow anything with sugar at the school's bake sale. Amy doesn't buy into her philosophies, nor her manipulation tactics, which causes Gwendolyn to try and ruin Amy's life. Applegate does an excellent job of making the audience despise her, while countering Kunis' charismatic charm.Amy pairs up with two other mothers who are on the same page as her. They're played by Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell. The former is always under-appreciated in comedic roles, while the latter is totally unrecognizable as a pushover and naive mother.It's truly the cast that helps carry this film so well. No character is a wash or unnecessary.And the jokes are consistent. They run all along the whole film without ever growing tiresome. Each joke is as fresh as the last--and there is a true sense of cohesion amongst it all. No bit seems out of place.The only thing wrong? The film portrays every husband as useless. Literally. Not one husband in the film is even a little bit competent at being a father or spouse. I guess it bodes well for the film's target audience, but it may alienate some men out there.But regardless, I still found the movie highly entertaining and one that I would watch over and over again.Twizard Rating: 91",Bad Moms

This is deemed acceptable behavior by feminists. We even see some presumably Muslims mothers thrown in the mix, no doubt for the sake of diversity and inclusion. We even gets jabs at males and whites, so it seems the target audience is low-minded SJWs.Third wave feminism is the opposite of humor. This stinker proves it. Mila Kunis is officially a has been, and Katheryn Hawn, a genuinely funny woman/actress is totally wasted in a hideously predictable role.Its becoming more and more clear that movies are intentionally dumbed-down these days, I can't believe a writer would intentionally write such a pile of excrement.",Bad Moms

There are a few explicit references, so it's not what I'd call a ""family oriented film,"" but it was a great Mom's Night Out movie. We all had a great laugh. A few of the more serious parts *do* emphasize the importance of standing up for yourself rather than allowing bullies to wear you down, but the message is surrounded by wonderful humor and by a ""grace under fire"" attitude that we all try to muster when the chips are down.If you haven't seen this one in the theaters, Netflix it and enjoy!",Bad Moms

The story was absolutely laughable, and not in the positive way. The climax/feels moment made me feel absolutely nothing because it was stupid to begin with. The love interest of the movie is forced and could be done without entirely. Just almost every plot point was unrealistic and forgetful.

Because it felt like this person had no idea how life works and seems to believe that everything come your way perfectly. Real-life link: nothing to reflect upon, everyone knows that moms would do almost everything when it comes to their kids. The movie gives nothing more beyond this idea. Everyone is a bad mom? Depends what you call ""bad"". It seemed like this movie called imperfection bad. It is not being a bad mom if you don't do your kids homework or you don't cook them breakfast. That's pretty normal, in fact doing those things is being a bad mom. Let your kid grow. And were they serious when the kids left Mila because she stopped spoiling them? So now kids, blackmail moms so that they become perfect? Oh and also, in the end the Gwendolyn becomes their friend because she has a private plane. Friendship can be bought so easily, seriously? Plausibility: Zero. Life is not as superficial and easy as this movie shows. You husband cheats on you? Great, I never loved him anyway and now lets go to therapist have a minor discussion in front of her so that she can conform that no way in this earth can our marriage be saved. Oh and also there is this hot single father that waits just around the corner for you when you leave your husband. And many many other ideas like that like the one when you get people to come to your party just because you send a text of you drinking wine or your husband suddenly obeys you just because you yell at him on the phone that you are going with friends to a school meeting.Character development: Gwendolyn is the only character that shows some growth, other just became more annoying. Acting: Mila is extremely bad. The scene when the coffee gets all over her, I could practically see her laughing. Why did she have the lead? Kristen Bell is a thousand times better.

Kunis gets fired, she can't reconcile with her ex-, her kids have problems - but she faces them all with the same bland non-angst.There's the evil PTA that somehow runs the school with the ""perfect"" moms as counterpoint which is so over the top that it's parody.

Starting from the basics it's has good comedy which is a plus point. The overall theme is good but at some places it feels like it works only for Amy (Mila Kunis).Characters are written fine.In one hour and forty minutes I liked it and I would suggest to see it as Nowdays comedy depends mostly on sex and other adult things.Cast is terrific and has well acted.Most People gave it around 3-5 but I am gonna stuck it with an 8 Because it deserves it.

Both are completely fine, and I believe people can switch between the two modes (or even find something in between). This film is for those who just want a good, albeit predictable, laugh.

They get tired of the pressures of a family with children. Leader, Gwendolyn played by Christina Applegate, of the School Parents' Association with her friends, Stacy and Vicky, demand perfection in parenting. Amy, Kiki and Carla make friends and join forces against a common enemy (Gwendolyn, Stacy and Vicki) in the Association election.The Movie is not too long. Actors and funny scenes carry through the movie. Rather week end of the movie decreases grade.Bad Moms is the moderate film. It's worth watching as a fun entertaining comedy. but not as a serious drama comedy. 7/10",Bad Moms
116,Ranbl,Fun and too real,8,13 September 2018,"This movie is not an oscar movie but it deals with a needed subject with a light hearted approach as to avoid being an afternoon special.

117,Hassan_Scarborough,Wasted potential,4,1 December 2016,"It was nice to see Mila Kunis carry yet another film but it's a mediocre film at best. Some fun funny moments but overall a very sub-par film. It's a film that wants to be a romance and comedy at the same time. Very difficult to take dramatic actors that aren't even that strong in that department, and blend romance and comedy. Comedy takes talent and timing and good writing. Aside from having the wrong cast for such an endeavor, it needed to commit fully to comedy and less to the romance aspect. A little more slapstick and more absurdity would have actually been better to maintain the audience's attention. A dramatic film with humor commits to the drama first and that becomes the plot device while humor is the buffer that lightens the heavy moments in the film. This film never does that. It depends on vulgarity and cheap parlor tricks in the way of gags to get a laugh instead of structuring a comedy film with over the top funny moments, which have a central plot. Then the film makes this lazy attempt to become an ensemble story arc in the second act for really no reason. Then it's the belabored overworked soccer mom subplot. Which is already laughable at this point but in this film it's ridiculous. The lead has no burden of finances. In fact the lead character is working part time with no problem and the main obstacle is her own idiocy. We never really see him transform from bad mom. It's the men in her life that end up the excuse as to why she isn't leading the life she thought she should be. So it goes from one element to another without finishing the central plot. Just not a well thought out film at all.",Bad Moms

Not only is she a Russian hot-tie but she also has real acting chops whether as an action hero (""Jupiter Ascending"") or as a love interest (""Ted""). But I was pleasantly surprised when Christina Applegate, another accomplished actor and former child TV star, showed up as Gwendolyn, the guileful PTA president who pushes Amy to her limit. Emboldened by her two new ""mom"" friends, slutty Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and mousy Kiki (Kristen Bell), Amy throws in the towel and starts 'breaking bad'. This movie deserves critical applause because of its ending, or rather endings. We cheer when Amy gets up off the canvas and knocks out Gwendolyn, we tear when Carla shows the love she has hidden from her son, we grin when Kiki starts wearing the pants in her marriage, and we smile when Gwendolyn discards her mask and gives back to the group. 9 out of 10.",Bad Moms
122,sergioschout,contender of the most horrible movie of 2016,1,20 August 2016,"We had been treated on a real horror-esque fest this summer. From botched up remakes of movies to well bad moms. There are no redeeming qualities. At least the new Ghostbusters had me laughing a bit now and again but this movie is nearly as bad as Himalaya, a three + hour movie i was forced to watch in highschool of how indigenous people herd their yaks over the mountain paths. I never walked out on a movie, except on this one.But back to the movie. Really Really bad script, not funny, man hating, failure to communicate and no sense of humor sums this erghm ""movie"" up quite nicely. basically story goes like this; Women make active choices they later regret ( like finding wealthy men and marrying them, plus having kids while sitting at home or just fail to produce anything noteworthy because of the lack of education... because they got children quite early). Then the say enough is enough.. go girlpower.. and act like deranged immature college frat boys/girls. Then they roll stupid and immature with each other and smash it into one big pretzel of fail.So conclusion: actresses, though still easy on the eyes seem to be the ones with their careers winding down ( some aren't as good of an actress to begin with). the so called humor is so immature that it is facepalm retch worthy. The script is even worse and yes, one could argue that actresses can't shine if the script is terrible.To end there is a disturbing trend in Hollywood where in certain movies the ""hate"" for one or more groups, oftentimes men in general, can see oozing like a slimer that just flew through the theater screen. Directors some advice: keep your SJW/feminasty social construct politics and Utopian dreams out of a movie that could have been OK-ish if you had bothered writing a half decent script.",Bad Moms

Here is a suggestion - watch the movie before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing.

It's just moms going crazy.Like I said in the title, it requires you to have a certain kind of humor. It's the kind of humor you don't write home about. Very raunchy with a lot of body jokes. If that is not your thing then you should avoid this movie because that's 90% of the jokes.Majority of the acting is cringe-worthy as people act out the most stereotypical representations of people there have ever been. So if that is something that bothers you then avoid it too.Overall it's not a movie for everyone.

125,sukanya-samy,Leave your brains aside comedy,3,28 October 2016,"If you can't do everything for your family, be a dick and do NOTHING. There is no middle ground. Well, it felt like that was the message that Bad Moms was sending out. So here is my review of the movie and the scoring system that I started from my previous review, of Lights Out.First reviewed on broth of blogsPlot and Script (P&S)Mila Kunis is a super busy, underpaid, working mom with 2 kids and a good for nothing husband. She is trying her best to keep to schedules and wants of the really demanding head of PTA Christina Applegate. But she has had enough and she snaps one day. She is joined by Kathyryn Hahn and Kristen Bell who are equally tired of doing everything on their own. They decide that it is high time to do nothing and indulge – in parties, alcohol and sex. What ensues is what Bad Moms is about.While I understand what the story is trying to portray, I don't get the direction they took. I mean indulgence could be a vacation or a few parties but who goes out to a grocery store and runs about like a crazy person? What does it take to be a good mom? Does a term like that even exist? Does a bad mom only look to herself? Well, such questions have been answered but in the most shallow way possible.Characterization and Acting (C&A)Mila Kunis is OK as the main lead, she does portray the frustration of being overworked well. But it still feels like she is in a role, doing a film – it doesn't look real. Like the almost real mom Susan Sarandon from Stepmom. Mila Kunis's husband is a complete throwaway character – just to show that he is useless and an idiot.Kathyryn Hahn portrays a single mom whose only job is to talk about men and say some really sad jokes – I didn't get her character at all. It looked like she was having a good time anyway – she didn't have to be a bad mom to do that. Kristen Bell is good as this timid wife who obeys her husband and brings out her wild personality once turning to the bad mom side. The best part of the movie was Christina Applegate who looked like a real bully and task-master – she was the only one who looked like she was playing a real person.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The songs in the movie were actually a little annoying and I didn't really care about the rest of the effects.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)Nothing great again.Direction and Overall (D & O)The script is so overused in Hollywood that I thought maybe this was different. It wasn't. It was as shallow as ever and the direction was just okay. Again, if the plot is zero, then there is nothing much the crew can do. The marketing was well done for the movie – the build up looked like it was a completely new take on moms. But if people think that being a good mom is all about doing everything on your own and not teaching your kids/spouse to share responsibility then they have got it all wrong, haven't they?So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 0.5Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 0.5 (Only for Christina Applegate)Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 0.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 0.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 0.5Overall score – 2.5 on 10If you want to leave your brains aside and just go watch a mindless movie, then give it a shot. Don't tell me I didn't warn you though! First reviewed on broth of blogs.",Bad Moms
126,drawnsupreme,Predictable Girl Power and Little Too Raunchy,5,16 May 2019,"Bad Moms has a few humorous moments here and there, but the movie was predictable and sometimes felt like it was a little excessive with the raunchiness and curse words, which gets boring and predictable quickly. Mila Kunis did a great job but this movie should have tried to be more creative and different from other similar comedy movies.This is an R-rated comedy for the most part, that can't decide whether to be excessively vulgar or take the 'feel good' family-friendly route, so it tries to juggle both, leaving you with a 'I've already seen this movie' feeling at the end.The script wasn't very fun and entertaining. Bad Moms could have probably been much more successful with light-hearted humor and a PG or PG-13 rating. The issue here is that we've already seen excessively raunchy R-rated comedies from Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Will Ferrell, and countless other great comedians - and those films worked at the time. But when you try to recreate the same thing with a female-lead cast, what originality are you really bringing to the table?",Bad Moms
127,cinesocialuk,More party animal than party pooper...but Momma could have whooped it up a bit more,7,27 August 2016,"If ever there were a film to make a child appreciate the unique pressures their beloved mother goes through (or has gone through) on a daily basis in order to run a ship-shape household, Bad Moms is probably not it.That's not to discredit the film as it's still an entertaining and frequently laugh out hilarious 100 minutes. But when push comes to shove, the Mommy dearest's in this film don't go half as far as Joan Crawford would on a 'normal' day.Thankfully, every joke thrown at us in a torrent of dirty talk and foul language hits the (low) mark, largely thanks to the whip-smart dialogue and the brilliant, core performance of Kathryn Hahn as the raunchiest, baddest of Moms.",Bad Moms

129,keniwhat,A few laughs but ultimately sexist. Or lazy.,4,30 August 2016,"This movie is a comedy with a simplistic message that is let down in a number of ways. The set up for the women to choose to be bad moms instead of trying to be good ones and failing regardless is quite weak but somewhat excusable for structural reason: the woman with two kids (Amy) has a full time job and a useless cheating husband. The stay-at-home mom (Kikki) has four kidsl under five. The other woman (Carla) just seems to be useless, but that is part of her charm as the comic relief. There are some good laughs when they initially choose to go 'bad', but it does not really go anywhere from there and instead descends into predictable fare. Amy comes out on top against her battle with the villain of the story (Gwendolyn), manages to separate amicably from her cheating husband, sees improvements in her son's attitude and ultimately manages gets the guy (the hot single dad) as the icing on the cake. A realisation that the role of a mom requires her to be 'good' is the ultimate message of the journey the women undertake and that 'good' may need a bit of redefinition. All that is fine but it is a little tainted by the overly sexist nature of the movie. All the male characters are negative. Amy's husband is a cheat, Kiki's a bully, the headmaster has relinquished his power, the gym teacher no spine, Amy's son is useless (partly her creation) and even Gwendolyn is only the villain she is because her husband is an embezzling cheat and thus yet another victim of male betrayal. The only non-dick is the hot dad but he is merely a meek sex object, devoid of real personality. There is a scene where a fearful woman only turns up to the meeting because Carla threatened to seduce her husband that is delivered well from a comic perspective. But it might propose the notion that all that men need to stray is opportunity. So, even male characters that are only hinted at are negative (think Gwendolyn's embezzling husband). Hence the movie is ultimately sexist. Or just lazy.",Bad Moms
130,Victreebong,Kunis may be the new Aniston...,9,27 January 2017,"(I have to admit something upfront. I am utterly in love with Mila Kunis and Katherine Hahn. So this is going to be biased, but I have good reason!) First off, both of these gals (and of course Bell, Applegate and Pinkett Smith) have stellar varied track records and are welcome familiar faces. Whether they're all supporting anchor men, fighting the Matrix for Zion, smoking weed with friends, or ruling the corporate consulting market, they have always held up others with their on screen support as costars. Well now it's the ladies turn and all I can say is good lord; why aren't they in leading roles more often?! Kunis is a knockout in this. A recently singled mother trying to balance her millennial filled work with her family, she befriends several other mothers who span the spectrum between married pushover to serial bar hag. Amy (Kunis) is somewhere in the between as a down to earth parent who's just had enough, whether it's dealing with a deadbeat husband, an overbearing school body, or a naïve hipster boss. When she's not trying to find her pacing on her own, slapstick, faux pas, and awkward social attempts occur. But never once do you feel like she's faking it. When she laughs, you laugh. When she's in pain, it hurts. When she's betrayed, you just want to beat the sh*t out of the person who wronged her! And getting hot coffee in your face is never fun. I don't know if they were actually drunk during those scenes, but there are some lushes afoot.The ladies mesh the best when they're all on screen together. Usually this is accompanied by heavy drinking (girls' night out style drinking, NOT self-medicating alcoholism) or bonding in their respective social clicks. This may sound cliché as some reviewers have stated, but I want to point something out. They're not doing it for the sole purpose a male's affections. There is a love interest in this movie with Amy, but it's never the A plot, only a minor B or C story line. The main grab is Amy trying to get her life back on track while taking on Gwendolyn (Applegate) as the president of the parent school body after her children were deemed unacceptable for the school's extracurricular activities. The overarching story line is not being a bad mom, but simply taking a moment for themselves so they don't actually turn into terrible parents. Whether this is letting a kid do their own studying, preparing lunches and actively participating in school activities, or standing up to a spouse to take on more responsibility, the women are trying to set their lives a little straighter. And if that sounds TRITE to you, get a better outlook on self-improvement, and a sense of humor.The pacing is great in this movie as there's an exhaustive mix of comedy, empathy, struggle, drama and catharsis. In the beginning, it's like one big giant .gif train of slow-mo party shots. Again, there's a lot of slapstick in this. If you like movies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall (another flick with Kunis and Bell!), Knocked Up, or self-indulgent mom humor, you'll get a big kick out of this flick. The second one just got announced for this winter (2017), I cannot wait. And Mila Kunis is of course gorgeous.",Bad Moms

Basically: Father's are idiots who don't care about the kids and take mothers for granted. It's OK to dispose of your family so you can sleep with a good looking parent. Kids have no real value and no long term emotions, if you consider yourself a good mom you can fix it all. This was utter garbage with terrible actresses.

132,AussieMovieReviews,Good Mums go Bad.,7,21 October 2016,"7/10. The story of some mums who are over their mundane life, and decide it will be fun to relax and break all the rules. I think this film is definitely geared more toward the female audience, and does a good job doing so. Some good laughs from the writers and directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who also wrote The Hangovers Trilogy. Mila Kunis does a really good and funny job as the lead, but probably the stand out is the the supporting actress Kathryn Hahn, who steals the show with her demented over the top one liners and gags, she is hilarious. Kristen Bell is great as well. Another high point is the soundtrack, which is up beat and helps set the mood. There are many problems though, with the lack of plot, and the story being very formulaic.

134,BuddyBoy60,"Despite its flaws, ""Bad Moms"" can still entertain you and leave you with an insight or two",6,1 November 2016,"ABOUT: ""Bad Moms"" is a comedy film which stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, and Christina Applegate It was written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who are best known as the writing duo behind the comedy hit ""The Hangover"". This movie is about parenting, specifically mothers and their difficulties in rearing their children.REVIEW: The movie starts perfectly in my opinion, strong and with a lot of laughs. It shows in a montage the dilemma of being a mother and how despite the great effort she gives, she still ends up feeling unfulfilled as a mother. So Amy Mitchell played by Mila Kunis, together with her new-found friends, Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and Kiki (Kristen Bell) decide to be bad moms and have a little fun for their selves. This attracted the opposition of Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), whose style of parenting is more uptight. The movie is entertaining but it has its flaws mainly with the execution. Like what I mentioned before, the movie started off well. I did not have any problem with how the movie established itself. The middle part was decently entertaining and funny mostly due to the comedic chops of Kathryn Hahn. I would say that much of the jokes in the movie are hers and the part that bridges the movie towards the climax of the film was anchored on her character. They are vital aspects of the movie and in my opinion and she did well. However, it was the last act where the movie become uneven and cliché. The last act approximately starts after Amy and her husband's failed attempt at therapy and when her daughter is sanctioned after being falsely accused of possessing marijuana in her locker which leads to the mother and daughters quarrel. Then, Amy's daughter and son leave and go with their dad. In the succeeding scene, which depicts Amy's loneliness and sadness, I find the tone to be misplaced and makes the overall movie uneven. I think it was a superb scene, great acting by Mila Kunis, but it turns out to be too dramatically heavy and in my opinion.Had it been a scene in another movie, perhaps a drama, it would have been a score for Mila Kunis,no doubt. However in a comedy movie, the tone of that particular scene goes to far on pathos and does not match the tone of the rest of the movie. Another flaw in this movie that I found is that I think that it descends to a clichéd climax and finish, the lead character gives up and then consoled and convinced by his or her friend/s to give it another shot, the lead character regains purpose and gives a great speech to end all speeches and wins, then everyone turns out to be fine and happy even the opposing characters. They all got along by the end of the film. There were a lot of movies that have used this same scheme for the final act and most of them are comedy films as well. It is an overused way to end movies and makes the film very predictable that is why I think it hurts the uniqueness of the film and how much it is going to stay fresh upon repeated viewings and be remembered after a couple of years from now.But despite the flaws and as much as it hurts the movie in general, the substance won me over. The film is comedic and it has a lot of jokes but surprisingly it also comments significantly about its subject matter, indirectly if not otherwise. It was unexpected but it's the insights in the movie that really caught my attention and in my opinion, compensates for the flaws and actually makes it a better movie overall. Some insights include the pros and cons of two varying style of parenting, being lenient versus being strict. And when you think that the movie is going to favor one more than the other, it does well in stating what is common between moms, that they are all, to a degree, bad moms. Because no matter which style you choose, may it be being a fun mom or a disciplinarian mom, rearing children is full of uncertainties specially living at present time where the challenge is greater, that being a perfect mom is unattainable. It may never be enough but all you can give is your best and hope that your children will turn out fine.FINAL WORD: ""Bad Moms"" is an entertaining movie even if it has flaws. The cast is superb and they make it worth your while. Watch it for what it is and don't expect ""The Hangover"". It may be as funny but not funnier. However, in terms of significant insights, I believe this movie has the edge.",Bad Moms

I was tempted several times to leave the movie theater but it would have a redeeming ending. It doesn't.Actor Jay Hernandez was a refreshing note in the film.",Bad Moms

147,Veteransson,"Not funny enough for a comedy, but not awful either..",6,8 January 2017,"'Bad Moms' is written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, most known for the writing of 'The Hangover'. This sounds promising but on the other hand, unfortunately, they've written movies like '21 & Over' and 'The Change-Up'. 'Bad Moms' is more similar to the latter two than it is to 'The Hangover'. The movie follows protagonist Amy (Mila Kunis), who's the very busy, young mother of two middle school kids. She's married to the father of the two children. He's basically worthless as a partner and a father and consequently she has to take on a huge work load which turns her life arduous. When she meets two other moms, played by Kathryn Hahn and Kirsten Bell, Amy decides to change her habits and starts letting herself come first for a change.'Bad Mom's is a silly comedy, with some flat and annoying characters. It gets very difficult to like anyone in this movie, besides Mila Kunis, who tries to make this movie work. Every character is larger than life and fits at least a couple of stereotypes. This stereotypical representation of the characters reminded of a bad high school movie, which it actually was, with the difference that the characters are all at least 10 years older. The movie does point out some of the difficulties of being a mom, and how hard it is nowadays to fit the norm of the 'perfect' mom. This makes you care more about the main protagonist in the story, and make you root for her. The other two moms that Amy befriends don't get a lot of introduction or background, and are thus very two-dimensional.A comedy needs to be funny and actually, this movie was able to come up with a couple of funny moments. There are a lot of comedies out there that fail completely at being funny and are therefore boring as hell. This movie isn't one of these comedies, but is however still not funny enough for it to be an enjoyable comedy, and I did get bored at times. There are some characters that are meant to be funny but turn out be nothing but silly and unlikable. If it wasn't for these couple of funny scenes and funny puns, and a committed Mila Kunis, this movie could have been an awful, boring comedy. Now, this doesn't mean we need more of these movies. Unfortunately, Hollywood didn't get this and a sequel has been announced for 2017.PS: If you haven't finished season 5 of Game of Thrones and you're still planning to, don't watch this movie. A major spoiler is revealed for the sake of a joke. The joke wasn't worth it.",Bad Moms
148,d.e.katz,Dreck,1,24 February 2018,"I could only manage watching 20 minutes of this atrocious piece of crap before I had to stop. Someone should have mentioned to the writers that excessive exaggeration is not the same as comedy. I felt bad for Mila Kunis, who deserves (and has performed in) better roles in better films, such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I wish I could be more helpful, but, as I stated, I just could manage to make it through the whole film. My advice: don't waste your time. You'd be better served by taking a nap.",Bad Moms
149,bcmantonya,Why so much hate?,7,4 October 2020,"It's a good movie, literally just made for fun. There's no huge, deep meaning in it. Just showing how women are trying their best and still beat themselves up for not being perfect. It was funny, silly, and had moments of seriousness, but mostly just a story to take you away from your own hard day to day struggles. There were a couple of lines that stood out as not exactly fitting in with the rest of the movie. And I thought the whole sexy widow storyline wasn't necessary. But I found it enjoyable and would watch it again.",Bad Moms
150,Bored78,Great Movie,10,13 December 2016,"I am glad i don't watch movies based on reviews. This is one of the best comedies I have watched in a while. I think people take movies to seriously and that is why it got bad reviews.The movie was well written. I loved the story and I'm sure many moms could relate to the story. The title description tells you it is a story about over worked and under appreciated moms. And that is exactly what it is about.These moms are only bad if you consider June Cleaver to be the minimum standard for being a good mom. The story does show us how mom's can easily be overworked and have almost impossible expectations of them. And how selfless they are sacrificing ""me time"" for a never ending list of duties. Finally reaching the point where they say "" OK, enough, i need a break. Others are going to have to pick up the slack for a bit""This movie portrays this in a comedic way. Some of the best comedy i've seen out of Hollywood in a while. Me and my wife both thought this was a very funny movie and had some good laughs while enjoying the story. All the characters were interesting and likable even the ones you are not suppose to really like. The acting was solid. The story was easy to follow and understand both what was going on and how the characters felt. You could relate to the characters.My wife doesn't often tell her friends, "" You have to watch this movie!"" This is one movie she told her friends they must watch. Ill end up owning a DVD of this movie. Its worthy of watching multiple times.",Bad Moms

But not the type of sadness that you feel for a person that had lost the genetic lottery or had a run of bad luck, but the uplifting kind of sadness that translates as ""Thank you God/Mother Nature/Flying Spaghetti Monster for not turning me into something like this."" It is stupid, it is ignorant, it is condescending, it is boring, it is a kind of movie that gives you a special appreciation for those trashy flicks that they make with one camera and a 1000$ budget. I can go all day long about how bad this movie is but I'll just skip to the conclusion - If you don't want to ruin your day, stay away from this one, as far as you can.",Bad Moms

Of course I'd have loved to see more racial variety in the main characters, but Mia, Kristen and Kathryn did a pretty good job, more so because their characters balanced each other out.I'm so glad that I got the opportunity to watch bad mom.

Whoever made this movie is clueless. Why are we basically laughing at these people who suffer in the hourly market. What is funny about that? We are the people that put you in your nice houses.

Shock horror. if you can think of a stereotype and then add in a female equivalent to Will Ferrell, you've already got the movie summed up. Gross out is the only punchline and it's weak. Yes, mums do a heck of a job. But where the heck are the dads? No brainers are fun, when they deliver. This is just a female version of the worst stoner comedies starring Seth Rogen and co. That's 100 minutes of my life I could've done something worthwhile with... but being a bloke, it wouldn't matter in the universe of this movie. It kind of depends on whether you liked Bridesmaids. If you did and your brain didn't leak fully out of your ears, then you'll probably like this. If you thought Bridesmaids sucked. Then give this the widest detour possible.",Bad Moms

It was supposed to be a comedy still I did not smile ones during the film - and I love smiling so that shouldn't be an impossible mission. At one point I considered I may cry a little because it was so pathetic - the uncircumcised penis scene - but it wasn't even pathetic enough for that. The whole film was nothing - well, at least the first hour, I just couldn't watch the rest of it. It didn't make itself believable enough to be enjoyable as a comedy, because even with a comedy you have to care about the characters or at least believe they could exist in some universe. And if it tried to go the more satiric road than it was too believable for that. I don't know what it was, other than a really bad movie and a complete waste of time and money.",Bad Moms

The movie doesn't have an original, amusing or insightful bone in its indeterminable length. Watching this movie was like having a kidney stone.The movie made quite a profit. One can only assume it was due to the presence of the word 'bad' in it's title. Previous movies with 'bad' in their title such as Bad Santa and Bad teacher were masterpieces compared to this rubbish.Despite its faults the movie still obviously takes itself seriously. It's theme of female assertiveness is meant to be profound but is depicted in the movie by the 'bad' moms getting drunk and molesting men and generally acting like 15 year old males supposedly do as shown in broad teenage angst movies.I repeat this movie is terrible.",Bad Moms

160,internetuser1655,A failure with some nasty hateful parts,3,29 July 2016,"This is another example of how a good comedy is far more difficult to make than a good drama or action flick.I was dragged along to this movie by a friend hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggested. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on the beloved Hangover franchise. It has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has.The ugly gag about uncircumcised men is particularly nasty and reveals a mean spirit considering that circumcision rates are declining in the USA and currently at only about 60%. So that's almost half the domestic population that has been insulted by the dirtbags responsible for this disaster. What pathology is behind this scene one can only guess at.",Bad Moms
161,JayHysterio,"Watchable, but not real and an insult to most women",6,23 December 2017,"Have to first admit I watched Bad Moms because of Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell. And there were some funny moments and I can certainly sympathize with moms...but not these moms.From what I understood, Amy and Kiki had husbands who were the main breadwinners, and Amy certainly lived in an affluent environment; why did she need a part-time job in the first place? She even says her husband was a successful mortgage broker. Kathryn Hahn's character, in addition to having a mouth that looked like it should have a hook in it (thank you Rodney Dangerfield), ONLY HAD ONE KID. And she couldn't deal with that? Did Kiki not know her husband was domineering before they got married and started having kids? These complaints seem more self inflicted than being victimized.I just don't see what these women expected when they got married and had kids. Maybe they thought it would be great to stay at home and not have the pressures of supporting the family financially like their husbands had to. Is it wrong to bring home the paycheck for food, clothing and shelter and want to just put the workday behind you? But I guess one day they realized they had a job to do as well and discovered it wasn't as great as they thought and wanted to get out. Just about every male character is portrayed in a negative light...even Jay Hernandez was served up as mere beefcake with no brain and nothing really to say. And by the way, his character was a widowed father and he seemed to have no issue with raising a kid. And any film that tries to portray JJ Watt as a squirming, weak soccer coach is really reaching to patronize women.But the worst was at the end where Kiki is walking with her husband and ordering him to do everything while sucking on a coffee drink that she could only afford because of her husband having a good job. So she wants to put even more crap on him just because she doesn't want to? I had no sympathy for any of them. As a line in the Big Chill said ""No one said it was going to be fun. At least no one said it to me""Show me a film with women who have to work full-time, underpaid and no on else to support them while trying to raise kids and I'll have respect for that.

They only mentioned the 'mom bra'. So should the emphasis be on the word *is* in that line? Or should it be on the word *sexy*. Anyone with half a brain could tell you the answer. Some people say the dialogue in this movie stinks... I reckon it's all Mila. I think she just doesn't know what the hell is going on in each scene. Actually, the scenes where she gets slammed by a kid and ends up with spaghetti on her face are okay because she's not talking in them! She's such a bad actress. I knew it from that 70s show when she delivered every line in the same flat, seethingly hostile tone. Now she's learnt to deliver her lines with *some* variation, but it's still not right.

Bad Santa is about a genuinely bad man who works as a mall Santa and robs the malls in which he works. Even Bad Teacher, as shitty as it was, is about a genuinely bad teacher. So what is so bad about these moms? They say bad words. They make sex jokes. One of the moms is a slut of which we never see her actually act on. They get drunk and make a mess in a grocery store.

173,Kevin_C1,A Bad Movie for Moms,3,4 August 2016,"Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.The worst thing about this movie, which is obvious from the opening monologue, is that it is corny. The story is corny. The characters are corny. The jokes are corny. The only audience that might let them get away with this cheese-fest, is mothers, because they will be able to relate.This movie has its moments, but the majority of its laughs fall flat. Particularly bad were a couple of different montages, specifically, one of the girls drunk grocery shopping. Most disappointing is how unfunny Kathryn Hahn is, it seems that every word that comes out her mouth has to do with sex.This movie also fails to follow some of the basic rules of a screenplay. The characters speak for the writer, not for themselves. The main conflict doesn't even come up until half way through the movie.The brightest spot of this movie is Kristen Bell's character Kiki, who is a weird stay at home mom. She provides almost all of the enjoyment you will get out of this film. JJ Watt and Martha Stewart also have funny cameos.I would not recommend this movie unless you are a mother. If you are anything but, avoid this train wreck at all costs.Game of Thrones SPOILERS BELOWThey also spoiled Jon Snow's death for the sake of a mediocre joke. Not Cool.",Bad Moms

175,Cathgotmusic,Something is wrong with the writers...,2,1 November 2016,"I wanted to like this movie, but there were just these very weird jokes and ideas about things like circumcision, and women in general... I would love to have sat in on a writer's table about the script. Who told them some of this stuff was a great idea?Mila Kunis is likable enough, and so are who two co-stars really. Definitely they carried this movie. But that script, and its random injection of things that make me think the writers might actually be terrible people. If it had come off as satire, fair enough. It really didn't though. Good God, the circumcision piece. It was like the 'geniuses' behind the curtain were very angry that someone would question their circumcision's necessity, and really decided to go all out on painting women as absolutely hating uncircumcised penises. Really really odd. The women also go to a grocery store, where one of the women sexually assaults a worker by forcibly kissing him. We were meant to think that was empowering and funny, and the guy gives a sort of smile at the end. It really didn't come across as anything but assault all the same. I'm not generally one who cares about what's off limits in a joke, and so having this movie get stuck in my craw speaks to how much of a weird vibe it puts out.I am not exactly hard to please either. I love Hot Rod, Blades of Glory, Brides Maids, Night at the Roxbury, etc. This silly movie cannot be a cult hit because of this pervasive sense that whoever had input on the script was a barely closeted bigot.

178,PopSpective_net,'Bad Moms' Will Make You Laugh,8,19 August 2016,"My wife and I went to see 'Bad Moms' on Friday. The movie came in third in the weekend box office–only slightly behind Star Trek Beyond, but a distant third to the new Jason Bourne movie. You couldn't tell that by our experience, though. Our first choice theater was sold out all night and the theater we went to was pretty well sold out as well.The cinema was apparently running some sort of promotional special for 'Bad Moms'. There is a bar in the lobby, but I have almost never seen anyone use it at all–and I've definitely never seen someone bring a drink into the movie. In 'Bad Moms', on the other hand, I think my wife and I may have been the only two people who did not have a drink. Most of the patrons had wine in special, limited edition 'Bad Moms' wine glasses. Let me just say that a theater full of inebriated moms is actually a tad worse than a theater full of teenagers. There was a lot of chatter and giggling, but I digress.This was the funniest movie I have seen in years. In my opinion, 'Bad Moms' would be hilarious for any audience. But, for obvious reasons it resonates more with moms. The production team did its research with real-life moms to identify the events and scenarios that come up in day-to-day parenting.The movie has an all-star cast of females, including Mila Kunis, Christina Applegate, Kristen Bell, and Jada Pinkett Smith–but the one that brought the most laughs for me is Kathryn Hahn. If you have children–especially if those children go to public school and you've had the pleasure of dealing with the ""PTA Mom""–this movie will make you laugh so hard you cry.I expect the Jason Bourne movie to be awesome and plan to see it this weekend, but if you're looking for laughs instead of action you need to go see 'Bad Moms'.Side note: I don't want to give away any spoilers, but make sure you stay through the credits.

I absolutely loved this movie, while chugging down my popcorn all by myself, I found the random person sitting beside laughing more at my ""laughter"" rather then the movie itself. I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I am not sure why it had a 6.7 rating, I gave it a 10. It was probably because of the language barrier, it had a couple curse words; but for me that's what made it so funny. I haven't had this much fun at the movies and laughed so much in a while now. It does relate to real life situations and the reason why I laughed so much is because most of the things that the movie was about my own mom would do. Mami would go out her way and would do anything for my two little sisters and I, even though I'm a daughter I did put myself in ""mom"" position while watching this movie. Some people recommend it if your a mo, but I personally recommend it for those who had babysit there nephews, cousin, or anything related to kids because its pretty similar how insane it is to take care of a kid. Director Jon Lucas, Scott Moore were also the ones who wrote it, did such an amazing job at producing this movie. I loved it so much that even the editing and music prod was amazing. I've seen quite a few funny movies, but when it came to comedy for me this is the best summer movie for 2016 I've seen! It also had some sexual content, which I believe it made it even more exiting.

She takes on a journey to ""get real"" and in the process helps so many others around her so the same thing. One very appealing thing about this film is Amy's decency (which you can see demonstrated many times). However, it's never more obvious that when she talks to a defeated Gwendolyn near the end of the film. Gwendolyn causes Amy no end of pain through the film, but at the end Amy is full of kindness and sincerity to Gwendolyn's pain. In today's eye-for-an-eye, zero tolerance culture it's refreshing to see the main character take a stand of caring more and revenging less. Amy is definite role model material.",Bad Moms

It revolves around 3 moms who are trying to find some peace with the responsibilities of taking care of their children.

The story was really lame and boring and I was hoping funny parts would make up for it. It did not. Maybe two laughs the whole movie and the rest just felt like a chore trying to watch it. Poor acting, very poor writing. The worse part beyond all else to me was the music. It felt like every five minutes it cut out to slow motion shots and an energetic pop song. This was kinda cool the first time they did it but than again, and again, and again. It lost all meaning and just got on my nerves. I think the writers even got board with this movie because in about 3 minutes at the end everything fell in place and it was over.

183,homeofthefalcon,The worst writing I've seen in a LONG time!,2,5 November 2016,"First off - how most people are rating this movie so high is beyond me... I will mention a few things here - WARNING SPOILERS! I repeat SPOILERS!The first point is not as much a spoiler as it is a general complaint about people casting Mila in main roles. Just like in Jupiter Assenting she feels like a B-actress surrounded by A- listers... or at least better B-listers. She does a horrible job at displaying emotions, and almost always have a small smirk no matter what emotion she is trying to project.Scenes which got me REALLY annoyed (tons of other scenes which where just mildly annoying!):Her daughter gets forced off the soccer team by ""illegal"" means from Christinas character, and she then goes to confront her in front of a group bunch of her ""minions"". Christina makes some REALLY weak arguments and burns, and Milas character just eats it with no comebacks of any kind... The scene is INFURIATING seeing how the movie has spent a LOT of time telling you how full of spunk and ""clever"" comebacks Milas character is......The next scene is even worse... Like... Insanely bad! Christinas character is trying to get Milas character to quit running for president of the PTA ......... by planting a few joints in her straight straight A-geeky-overachiever-daughters locker... which of cause is found because of an anonymous tip. Milas character and her daughter is called in to the principles office to get told that now her daughter - who is off the soccer team now no longer can play ... soccer??? And they just eat it again! DA FAK!!!! Really! If someone planted drugs in your kids locker, and you KNEW 110% that your daughter had never done drugs, what would your reaction be? ... This is what ANYONE which an IQ higher than 84 would do: ""Please mr. Principle stop touching that bag. I'm calling the police because that is obviously a plant."" ... and when the police arrives ""Hi officer can you please run a drug test on my daughter to confirm or deny if she has ANY trace of drugs in her system, and then dust down her locker and that plastic bag for prints - i have a feeling it will match with the president of the PTA - oh and also please run a DNA test on those joints... the DNA might match her or one of her friends also""But nope...

The movie was so bad that I even decided to write my first review just to warn other regular Joe's like me. I guess I laughed once or twice but most of the joke were just so lame and cheap. They really did not make me laugh at all. Maybe this is a gender or mom thing but if you are an average man like me just skip this rubbish. The film is not worth watching and especially not worth going to movies. Don't waste your time or money on this film. Maybe worth some Razzie awards?

186,rjkjklose,Bad Moms but not a bad film.,7,23 October 2016,"The surprise hit ""Bad Moms"" is a comedy starring Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn and is directed by both Scott Moore and Jon Lucas. This movie centers itself around Amy (Mila Kunis) a mother of two who is a bit of a perfectionist. She aspires for her family to have the best that the world can offer. Unfortunately, after a series of bad events everything goes downhill fast. Luckily Amy befriends two other struggling mothers Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who work together to try and make some sense of their crazy lives, while having some fun at the same time. First and foremost, ""Bad Moms"" works extremely well. I can honestly say that this movie completely shattered my expectations. While the film isn't breaking any new ground or providing any sort of different approach to the extremely over saturated comedy genre, it is fun. That's right, the film from start to finish never fails to entertain. The films humor works on multiple levels. The jokes here never quite seem to stop coming and the entire film feels thoroughly littered with hilarious moments. This is an excellent break from many modern day comedies where all of the jokes come in both the first fifteen and last fifteen minutes. Raunchy humor was obviously a big selling point for this movie, yet thankfully the movie never feels too overbearing with its vulgarity. Never once did I notice a particular character was dropping ""F-Bombs"" just for the sake of it, but when they did the jokes were hilarious. Writing in this movie is the chemistry between these actresses also felt extremely tight and without it the film just would not have gelled correctly. All of the actors here are surprisingly funny. Even Kathryn Hahn's (who I have found quite annoying and overly rambunctious in past outings) character here proves to be hilarious and she never misses a beat. Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell also play very entertaining and likable characters. Another surprise was Christian Applegate, Jada Pinkette Smith and Annie Mumolo's performances as the villain moms. While at times they got a tad too outrageous for their own good, these three women were truly amusing and helped further the comedic aspects of the film. Also, a huge shout out to Martha Stewart's hilarious cameo in the film. The only negative that can really be geared toward the acting in this film is the child actors. While I'm sure these kids didn't exactly chose the writing they were given, they come off as spoiled little brats. Throughout the entire movie these kids constantly pestered the overall fun tone that this movie was riding on. Speaking of tone, this movies strength comes from the lighthearted nature of the plot. The movie is surprisingly heartwarming, yet never overbearing on its themes of family unity. The film knows it's a comedy and it sticks to being a comedy very well, something that can be attributed to the excellent direction and writing in the film. Yet another strong suit in ""Bad Moms"" has to be its well-rounded pacing. Very seldom in this film does it feel like the plot is glossing over important story points. Impressively it does this while at the same time remaining consistently funny. Moving on to the soundtrack and overall sound design of the film: The soundtrack while not exactly bad, is utterly forgettable. Audiences will struggle to remember a single track and relating scene in the film by the next day. Going into this movie I completely expected a bland over saturated film about female characters going wild. Instead what I received was a smart film that carries extremely strong female characters without having them seem needy and dependent, something that haunts the film industry today. Luckily this film does all of these things while remaining consistently hilarious and surprisingly sincere. Ultimately ""Bad Moms"" suffers a few minor hiccups along the way, but comes out a surprisingly hilarious and fun romp.",Bad Moms
187,bensuarezz,This movie sucks!,3,20 May 2018,"The way the characters are portrayed are terrible. You absolutely do not feel with them.

188,lawrence13,Couldn't Watch More Than Ten Minutes,1,18 October 2016,"In a time when the left wing of Hollywood are gunning for Donald Trump for language he used about woman in a private conversation from many years ago I began to watch this movie in a state of shock at the pornographic standards that Hollywood and the media have sunken to.This dive in to the gutter of life is only matched by the left media's hypocrisy. The film starts of and in the first couple of minutes when the boss of Mila Kunis is telling her about his dream he had where he was in a hotel naked with his balls on show. Now there was no need for this in the story line but this is what goes for entertainment now.The film from there just sinks into a family film mixed with porn. Mila character catches her husband wanking in front of a computer with a girl showing her pubes totally nude on the screen. It then switches to the children's school where the three busy body mums start talking about how they'd let a dad whose wife had just died stick his penis in their butts. At that point I stopped watching. Is this what our society has come to? I guarantee that kids will watch that movie and probably with their parents How does this stuff get past the censor, its pure pornographic filth, if I lived in Hollywood and met the director I'd punch his lights out for creating this moral sewage and pouring into family TV rooms around the world. It's disgusting, its disturbing and nothing more than corrupt Hollywood lefty Clinton supporting luvvies grooming young kids to b prepared for the sordid life style Hollywood, the left media and music industry is creating.These are the people screaming at Trumps private words.

No luck for them poor souls, jokes don't come out that easy - what a surprise for 'Bad Moms' crew. I am at a loss of words to describe this drivel. There is no script to speak of nor a hint of any meaningful message. There are no funny moments, you only feel very awkward that this could have appeared on the widescreen. Acting is atrocious. I had my serious doubts about acting skills of Mrs Kunis after Book of Eli and especially Jupiter Ascending and this confirms low expectations. I can stretch my imagination to see if 'Bad Moms' can appeal as some sort of fantasy adventure entertainment for some people but as a work of comedy or god forbid cinema art 'Bad Moms' is setting new standards of low.

From my point of view this movie describes exactly what happens to the women when they give birth in 18-20 years old. I don't know much about the writers, but i assume at least one of them is from such kind of family.But overall in the movie you don't actually see that the main actors are career woman or even remotely busy all day. May be Carla is exception here, but all the other moms didn't left the feeling that they work for 40-45h a weak.Mila Kunis is a great actress, but she was not a right one for the main role here, because she don't have an ""overworked mom"" body expression.The best act in was made by Christina Applegate, hands down.

192,sweetdoxy,Zero female energy,2,1 February 2019,"This is such an embarrassing movie.
It is so unbearably pretentious. It's basically a high school teen movie in mum format.
Every dialogue in it was desperate for the public's approval, the public being dumb, modern feminists with pseudoproblems. The writers are male and it shows in every way possible. There is actually nothing in it that females, mums, can relate to. Unless they're generation z females who as mentioned before are modern feminists with pseudoproblems, like free bleeding and being judged on their instagram account. They have zero human essence and are all about buzzwords, much like this movie.
The dialogues really were the worst thing ever. It was just such painful cliche, every single word they said. Women, mums do not say things or act like that. They had put the words of teenage boys or immature men into mums. It was just unbearable.
And then the characters and the plot - wow, a bunch of mean girls, the ""underdog"" in the form of a rebel who thinks she's special cause she doesn't go along with what is presented as the majority in the film. And then the pathetic hot guy. I still feel major second hand embarrassment over how the ""mean girls"" were all hot for him and the dude went for the ""underdog"" like in a true american teen romcom.
Everything about the film was just so wrong. The mums actually WERE bad and not because they were following the majority at the start or cause they were rebelling against it, the writers just have zero clue about being a mum and how mums feel about kids and handle them. It felt like the writers had been brought up by single dad and they were gay themselves, never had any female contact.
There was zero female energy in the film. Majorly cringeworthy.
Plus the film itself failed in the plot too. At the start they're saying how the have those ""mum dreams"" and yet what gets them all popular and their plan into motion is some stupid male frat party type of event.
I just cannot believe how embarrassed I still am after watching the film. It is just cringeworthy.
I would have given it only one star but I like the actress Kathryn Hahn. I didn't like her character just like all the rest but I like her in general. So, she gets a point.",Bad Moms
193,dkodgis,Not the best and not the worst and funny in parts,7,31 August 2016,"It is a successful movie. It has earned $125 million at the end of this month, Aug, and it cost $20 million to make. It starts out uneven, and Kunis is not in a groove. About 3/5 into the movie, things start to click a bit and it starts getting funny. Consider audience. Most likely this is for young moms and recent young moms. True there is gratuitous dirty humor and jokes and it seems like just another teenage movie but add ten years or so to the cast. But just like a cheap novel, you can lose yourself in it and have a laugh or two. In this day and age, if an hour and forty-one minute movie can do that, why not? The cast is a bit surprising in parts and even wooden Martha Stewart does not mind making fun of herself in the movie. Kunis in her role smooths out and the movie skips developing obvious plot points, ignores them, and I think this helps the movie out. It is just about fun and laughing and by the middle of the movie, that is all the movie is about. It is not steady fare, not artful, somewhat dirty, and yet it pulls off a few laughs.

This movie is about the struggles that mothers face in judgment by society, other family members, their children, and their peers. Not to mention self-loathing from guilt they feel at the slightest misstep, thereby labelling themselves as ""bad moms"". The movie shines a harsh light on a society where in a 2 income household, it's common for today's mom to LITERALLY be run off her feet. And with the fantasy of some clever story writing and endearing characters, the film manages to show what life could be like if moms would give each other, themselves, and even their kids a well deserved break. Laugh with them, cry with them, celebrate with them as they go on their mom adventures, and just relax and have FUN.

198,klare28,Made me laugh so much - very entertaining,7,30 August 2016,"I feel like I need to pitch in here with all these bad reviews. My sense is that most of the haters probably aren't mothers/ parents, or maybe not in a highly competitive area, or their kids are still too young, or they're not working, or they're just perfect and prudish. But, I'm a working Silicon Valley mom, and so many themes in this movie hit a raw nerve, showed an ugly – of course grossly exaggerated – truth and provided huge comedic relief i.e. I'm not the only overwhelmed, stressed out high performing mom with -of course- high performing kids in a supposedly ""perfect"" relationship. We laughed so hard at so many things, the whole theater did; there where even scenes the whole audience clapped because it was so true and so funny.So, yes, Mila Kunis wasn't that great, the love and relationship scenes were flat and unrealistic, some of the jokes just not good (the uncircumcised penis one for example). Yes, a little better editing wouldn't have harmed. Of course, everything was over the top but OVERALL it hit the nail on the head and it was really fun. Christina Applegate was superb as the grotesque epitome of the Uber-PTA mom, there was the boss we all know who just doesn't get it, the husbands who take on less and get away with it somehow Kathryn Hahn was amazing and Kristen Bell was great also. Yes, this happens to all of us, some of the times, and it's so exhausting.so it was really fun to get a good laugh and know that we can do this, and maybe just need a little more humor so that we take it all less seriously.",Bad Moms

The comedy was funny in the vein of Tina Fey/Amy Pohler and I honestly thought I would be seeing that caliber of comedians. I was surprised to find Mila Kunis as the lead in this level of a comedy. Obviously having a veteran like Applegate helped, however Christina's character was not the typical leading comedic role. This actually was a nice touch, and should have given the movie higher ratings then I have seen. In fact, I am troubled by the less than stellar reviews by the users on this site.

Its not funny, and it feels over-long. the plot is tired and insanely droll and predictable. There are also several plot holes that are so obvious they just take you out of the moment. this movie is not even worth the $4.99 rental fee. Mila Kunis and Christina Applegate are the more memorable characters by a long shot, but still definitely skip it.

The movie has a plot that has been used numerous times in many high school flicks that you'd think Hollywood should start feel that it was overused, but not this time.Basically, the movie is about the PTA president (Christina Applegate) who is a bully controlling perfectionist freak, when the not so perfect Mila Kunis decides to stand against her tyranny and overthrow her to become president, with some subplots that could have been more meaningful if the movie hasn't tackled them with such shallowness, like the so much pressure on parents to become perfect by even making up stuff that do not benefit the kids at all, and the unbalanced relationships among others, and the 80s born generation who is now in the struggle for balance between adulthood and youth.The movie had some laughs in it, but all in all it was not worth the time, had you replaced the moms with high school kids it would've been the worst movie in years, but the story would've worked just as good.And finally, if you are looking for the movie to win the Oscar for most characters flip 180 degrees for absolutely no decent reason and no build up whatsoever, this movie is your champ, I think the crew members probably changed from evil to good too because this must be an outbreak in the set or something.",Bad Moms
207,potfilmer,Let's have a moratorium...,2,30 October 2016,"I see a lot of reviewers and commentators have called out the idiotic and gratuitous scene of the 3 women doing a lame and ignorant ""comedy"" bit about dreading to meet a man with an intact penis. This is a tired trope that's been going on in too many American movies and TV shows for years and reflects only the trauma and insecurity of the male writers who clearly and sadly feel the need to try and convince American women that their cut and scarred penises are superior. I just want to make a couple of points:Firstly - shame on the 3 actresses for demeaning themselves by playing and uttering the nonsense in the scene instead of calling it out for the bullshit it is.Secondly - shame also on Universal for agreeing to include a scene that does not play at all well outside the domestic market where it is simply mystifying and makes American women look like imbeciles.Thirdly - scriptwriters - just give up this tired crap about dicks. Probably three quarters of the worlds male population have intact dicks as nature intended and women (yes, even American women) do not run screaming from the room if they see one!

Kathryn Hahn was HILARIOUS (actually, I wouldn't be surprised if she snags some award for her role). Went with a gaggle of fellow mums and we all laughed, chortled and slapped our knees 'dying' with laughter throughout. Acting is nothing to rave about (except Kathryn) but who cares, the whole film was totally enjoyable on the whole. The likable Mila is in pretty much every frame, which is fine, she's harmless, and gives good hair. Christina Applegate is always good too. Trippy seeing Kristen Bell as a frumpy mother of four kids.

The first time was an art-house movie where a lady was writhing around on a floor of broken mirrors reciting Japanese haikus whilst crying for 40 minutes. I'm not sure which of the two was worse.Let me preface this - I am a working mother around the same age as some of the characters in this film. None of this rings true to me, mostly because of the way the script was written (by a couple of men who have clearly no idea what being a working mum is). The cast is great, the idea is great. It should have almost been the Clueless of the next generation on (humour wise). The women end up looking humiliated for being meek or embarrassingly gross. We have no idea where their children are when they decide to go AWOL. 'Hey - want to go to the movies?' 'Sure! I'll just dump these 4 under 5s somewhere and we'll go to a bar'. Hmmm.My two friends and I lasted 20 minutes. There was a big crowd of younger girls, possibly not yet having had kids, that were laughing their heads off. So I think there is a market for this.

The main characters sometimes acted in a way that was remotely relatable at times, but everyone else in the film was very 2 dimensional and complete unbelievable. All men in the film were portrayed as idiots, as we're many of the women. Most of the scenes were completely unbelievable (her workplace, the PTA meetings, the school hierarchy, the bars, the supermarket, the therapist, interactions with her husband, interactions with her new boyfriend, etc.) I really can't recall any scenes that were not awful on a few levels.

We knew the movie would be bad, but this was so so so much worse. I find movies funny when they contain some authenticity. When I can say, ""Wow, this is over-the-top, but there's a shred of truth here."" Ummm, no. This had the same sentiment as an ABC Family movie, but mixed with the worst frat boy humor available. I doubt whether the writers have actually met mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this?

Written and directed by the same crew who brought us Hangover, it has a sliver of what made Hangover funny and the rest of this movie is what made Hangover hard to watch. Bad Moms is a pseudo feminist contrivance pretending to be a hilarious comedy. It's message is a 30-year-old cliché - a cliché that is delivered partly in the style of Charlie Chaplin slapstick and The Three Stooges buffoonery. My spouse and I saw Bad Moms at home streamed and neither one of us could get past the first half without looking for a wretch pale. Most people can't be slapped in the face with a joke and find it funny. And that is the way humor in this movie is delivered. Cheap laughs.

Sure it got a few chuckle moments and Applegate is OK as the evil b**ch but that's about it.

There really isn't any nudity..(one extremely small scenes) Most is language and sex related talk . However, if you can are fun, have a sense of humor , and enjoy this type, you will LOVE it. My mom loved the movie Bridesmaids and it was her favorite prior. This was much funnier! Much better! Yes there are a few things that were cheesy I felt like in the very beginning .. but honestly this IS supposed to be a little over the top. It's a comedy! It was a great laugh.

Instead I was faced with no laughs and no comedy. The 'jokes' are crude and rely on crude sexual references throughout, with the odd bit of slapstick when the writers just couldn't be bothered any more. The circumcised penis scene was embarrassing to watch, it could be considered highly offensive and sexist and will alienate the vast majority of male viewers.The premise of hard working mothers making a few mistakes when bringing up their children and gain some redemption against judgmental parents who can do no wrong, isn't too bad. However, it is ruined by a dreadful script and a frank lack of effort. The idea that a wealthy, middle-class American mother rules the school from her role as the PTA president is ludicrous. A popularity context then ensues and after a spontaneous rave at house party full of mothers, that includes a random girl-on-girl kissing scene for no apparent reason, leads to the most obvious result in a PTA presidential election (if that's even a thing.Mila Kunis is poorly cast as a 32 year old working mom with a twelve year old daughter and a son.

I love the focus it puts on the pressures of being a parent & the pressures that, generally but not always, get put on a mother in particular. Women tend to be more worried about what others around them think, so it makes sense that they feel a certain kind of pressure men don't feel. I'm not a parent, so I'll nix now any reviews that say you have to be a parent or a mom to enjoy it. I laughed the entire time and let myself relax watching. I didn't pick anything apart because that's not necessary when watching a comedy, a movie specifically made to enjoy & not criticized for anything else. It's heartfelt. You can feel the love that came from making it, from the acting & all other positions. I immediately watched A Bad Mom's Christmas after because I wanted that loving feeling to continue.

I think the problems began in casting the stunning Mila Klunis as a "" down trodden mom who is married to an under achieving child like husband. The role would have been more believable and garnered more empathy with a more realistic Mom figure. I then found myself weighing up the credibility of the other characters.. *Handsome widower- entirely one dimensional fantasy bonk Sidekicks.... *The loud one....Brassy Jewish bad ass Mom sidekick - vulgar, sex addicted alcoholic *The quiet one.....Mousy oppressed Mom Even the PTA ( baddie Moms) had the clichéd group types you normally find in a teen high school comedy. The whole thing is a juddering, clunking mess of a movie that struggles to be both vulgar enough and funny enough at the right moments.

I'll start by spotting feminists' dirty influences: women are strong and independent while men are week, stupid and pathetic. Men are objectified constantly in this movie, while woman can do no wrong. Bragging lines like ""when i walk on the street it was raining d*cks"", ""I have a stable of hot dudes"" or ""did you drive a spike through his nuts"" make this movie utterly disgusting. In comparison, ""Grab them by the pus**"" doesn't seem so wrong now.The plot is your basic, dumbed down Sex and the city story, where you have the 3 typical women: the intelligent/independent one, the slut and the strange, silly one. The movie describes the oppressed life that moms are living, doing absolutely everything, while dads just sit around the house and masturbate on the internet. We follow along these 3 brave and independent women as they break away from their daily motherly enslavement, to live a FREE and accomplished life: getting drunk, ignoring their children, having brunches, drinking champaign in the morning and going shopping. You know, stuff that every shallow girl dreams to do. But of course, freedom has it's price. This is when their rivals appear, another 3 typical women: the bossy one, the black one and the stupid one. The conflict arises when one mom doesn't want to attend PTA meetings anymore.

Their chemistry on screen is very visible in what they do. Like any movie, the plot has high-points and low-points emotionally wise. The cast does a very good job of adapting to the situation, to prevent it from being boring or drawn-out.Overall, the movie is a 7 on 10. I score it this grade because it delivers on it's promise.

Why are these triggered men watching a chick flick like this in the first place? f*ck off c*nts. 10/10 y'all are wussies that don't know how to chill out, like gosh.I think this movie is great for a few reasons. It makes the mom viewers feel better about themselves and be less stressful and worried over their actions and needs as mothers. the movie is also provoking us to be ourselves more and not try to act like a robotic mom machine that does nothing but serve the kids 24/7.

I was surprised to see the negative reviews about this movie, then I realized we don't all like the same things. I found Bridesmaids uncomfortable at times, this is laugh-out-loud for me. The 3 of us over-worked moms appreciated the craziness and flat out raunchy humor. I took off one star because the movie was a little uneven - the family and romance scenes fell a little flat to me. Didn't have the same hint of truth and satire that the mom-friend-outcast scenes had. We had to literally PHYSICALLY brace ourselves every time Kathryn Hahn opened her mouth - snorts, hysterical laughter, cry-laughing - oh yeah, we did all of that. If you 'leak' a little when you laugh, wear a full Depends, you'll thank me.Leave the guys at home, leave the kids for sure... if you don't have kids, you probably won't get it.

Anyone who is a mom or dad could definitely relate to the struggles in this movie. Watching her run around trying to get every where was hilarious. The drinking PTA meeting was a dream come true, if only!! And I think we can all relate to the dating part, especially if you're a single parent. I love how the stay at home mom discovered herself. And I absolutely loved the ending, I hope there is a second one!! You should give it a shot. The pairing of the cast was awesome.

I admit I laughed at a few places, but there was way too much course language and crude humor. Too many movies are resorting to cheap tactics like that anymore. Some is OK, but this movie overloaded on it. Anyway, Bad Moms could have been much better, but was not. The acting was decent, just very poorly written, and no true character development. The plot line was formulaic, the relationship between Amy and Jesse was predictable and did not work for me. The character Karla was as a crazy single mom was overplayed. Kristen Bell did a decent job of playing the stay at home Kiki. The movie should have dived into the issues and troubles of modern parenting, and could have done it in a very funny way, but they did not.",Bad Moms

So one day she decides to no longer put in 100% all day every day, instead being satisfied with just getting by; and laying down the law with all those who have abused her and taken her for granted for so long. What follows is a revelation that no mom is perfect, and it's okay as long as one loves their children and teaches them to be good people. My most memorable, movie moment of ""Bad Moms"" is the scene when Kristen Bell, who plays a mousy mom, finally stands up to her hubby and yells ""And I said, I'm going to the f****ng PTA meeting with my f****ng friends, so stop being such a goddamn p***y and make it work!""

At first, this movie feels slow and long, another word of boring, I underestimated this film. But there is one thing, but then i stunned by the script or action of the players. Wow, is this one of the best movies for parents? On the other hand the rating of the film is low, so I finished watching the movie until the end to give an honest review. So yes, this movie is not suitable for some types of people, especially unmarried ones. So they are free to give any stupid review that damage this movie rating. You bastards, wait until you become parents and then watch this movie again, so you can understand what a good message to be conveyed by the author. But yes, this is one of the best movies ever made for parents, especially mothers (we all salute you, moms). Intelligent and not looking cheap, packed by a good and sharp writer, this film managed to bring up the true facts of everyday life that a mother passes through. How difficult it is to raise a child, the whole routine to be accomplished, that a mother must be perfect and flawless. A difficult and complicated world, is'n it? Are you a parent?

In today's society, it is not easy to be a mom, especially if you work and this movie captures all of it and how us moms sometimes feel like we need to throw in the towel for a couple of days and just have fun. This is likely to be my new favorite comedy (it is up there with The Hangover and Wedding Crashers for me). Kathryn Hahn deserves an award for her role-she played THE best part!

I'm a parent and understand the point of the movie, and the demographic it was aimed for. So I believe women, more importantly mothers may still enjoy this movie. This is where I suspect many of the positive review came from; but the bad jokes and slow and awkward delivery were wasted on me. I love comedies and usually can find something positive to say; but not on this one. The message although positive and relatable is all it offers. The jokes feel forced and sad more than funny.

The countless crappy attempts at ""humor"" fell flat on their face over and over and, had I not been with a friend, I would have left after 15 minutes.But I had to endure a SAGA of ridiculous story lines, and so many loose end tie ups.

But this movie was freaking boring and stupid. Every 'mom' cliché possible was used. Hover mom, drunk / sloppy mom, working mom blah blah blah. Of course the husband also had to be useless and cheating. It couldn't be more predictable. Half way through the movie I looked it up and saw that it was written by 2 men...

But at the end of the movie, we both wanted to see it again immediately. I could not stop laughing the whole movie but there were also some touching moments that were very heartwarming. I thought Kristen Bell was HILARIOUS as Kiki. She keeps amazing me with her talent as an actress. Mila Kunis did a pretty good job as well. Kathryn Hahn was also SUPER funny. She made me laugh every time. Also shout out to Annie Mumolo as Vicky, she had me laughing a lot.

Loved Mila Kunis but she played a mom with a part-time job, 2 kids, in a Big-foot house, yeah...not believable! and then riding off into the sunset with friends on one of the friend's husband's private jet...please!! i shoulda saved my little hard earned $30.00 and waited for HBO",Bad Moms

Was this a documentary worthy of some award? Still no. But what it WAS is so under appreciated and the bad reviewers need to take a step back, get off their high horses, and just learn to enjoy. ""Bad Moms"" was a hysterical (if at times edgy/cringe-worthy) comedy about all of the aspects of being a mom today. My best friend and I went with our teenage daughters, and we ALL laughed hysterically, and even shed a tear at some scenes. While grossly exaggerated/unrealistic in some parts, this comedy did justice to the trials and tribulations that women go through as mothers in the 21st century. From being under appreciated by our children and spouses, as well as at work (if we are a working mom), to the unrealistic expectations put on us by society, just about every type of mom was represented, and it worked. It was meant to be a funny, irreverent, certainly ridiculous, but most of all, an honest representation of motherhood as experienced by many women. So lighten up, people. If you expected an Academy Award winning performance or some wholesome family film, go see another movie that isn't rated R (you DID see that, didn't you?!?)

The entire party scene has been done and beaten to death! The whole penis thing was unfunny and borderline sexist in it's own right.

I would recommend this to anyone older than 18-years old, or 16-years or older with parental supervision. It was raunchy but just enough raunchy humor.I thought Gwendolyn, played by Christina Applegate, Amy, played by Mila Kunis, and Amy's daughter, played by Oona Laurence were the highlights of the movie. Christina Applegate's character was easy to hate as she did horrible things to children like place weed in their locker. Mila Kunis's character was a great mom with a jerk husband. She was easy to relate to and felt like an average joe. As for the supporting cast, I was not a big fan. They weren't as exciting and interesting as the main cast. They seemed very plain.

Very funny movie full of a tad bit of over exaggerated truths of being a mom in America these days. All the ladies in the cast were perfect together. Kathryn Hahn is hilarious.

These are worrying times...Bar one amusing reference to a certain recent sci-fi film, this film fails to land any laughs.On to storyline. Half way through the film they decided to try and shoehorn in a moral to the story. Unfortunately every time a point was made, it was duly undermined/contradicted around 10 minutes later.

Here are just a few things that I loved about this movie: - It has an all female lead, which is so rare but so appreciated. Character development which is something I always love to see, to watch a character learn and grow from their mistakes. Strong female characters who are still feminine. Female character who has a lot of sex isn't vilified or slut-shamed in any way. It's refreshing to see a female character who can be openly lascivious without being put down or shamed by another male or female character.

The scene, with the boy, in the kitchen about entitlements, was spot on.This movie was funny from beginning to end making light on how PC, and judge-mental our society has become, and it was so refreshing to see a movie showing how PC our environment has become. That negative review about the scene making fun of circumcision, really, grow up. That has to be one of the funniest scenes I've seen in years. Directors , producers, and the actors did a jam up job.

The morals of the movie, how to put your children and your own needs first, stick up for your beliefs and the loyalty of friendship to help each other through any situation, was all priceless. Best feeling, besides enjoying this film with my children and my mother, besides the appreciation and humor we have towards each other, seeing and hearing others experiences with their mothers and children really adds the extra effect.

Husband just siting on the couch doing nothing, the feeling of being judged for not participating in PTA or volunteering for school fundraisers and rushing my kids out of the car because I'm running late to a meeting. Eating in the car is something I have to do all the time, because we're always in a rush.I gave this movie 7 stars because it did get a little too raunchy and over the top. It started off funny, but kind of got ridiculous, from being a great mom to a horrible party mom. I can understand the occasional breakdown, but where were the kids the whole time? AND the uncircumcised P, that was just weird too.

I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing.

If you removed the near constant crude comments about sex and sexual organs as well as the profanity there would be maybe 15 minutes left of the show. The men are characterized as morons, the 'moms' as clueless, disorganized wimps except for the female co-star. She is a sexually aggressive piranha with no filter. If the part had been played by a man who groped and made sexually suggestive comments towards women you'd see women up in arms crying about sexism. They would be digging in their purses for their therapist's emergency phone numbers five minutes in. But it's okay for a female lead to portray this and men should be okay with it? Double standard there? The 'children' in the show are portrayed as disrespectful and patronizing towards their parents with no consequences.

You know, I'm not a mother, but that shouldn't be a requirement to see a movie. But perhaps if I was, I would've laughed more? I don't know. What i know is that I thought everything was excessive. Excessive to the point where it's just not funny anymore. I know its a comedy and so on, but its just ridiculous when its so far from the reality. I liked Kathryn Hahn's character in the beginning, but then its just went to far. Everything she talked about was about sex, and...more sex. Mila Kuni's character basically had the same story. She loves her kids so ******* much. Really? You have to swear that out? Its okay the first time but.... five more times? Stop it. To much. So the movie had potential, i liked the idea.

She walks in on him and he is your typical asshole/buffoon. There is the set up to be a bad mom. Now she gets together with another woman (Kristen Bell) whose husband is controlling and wants her barefoot and pregnant. Finally, the third woman (Kathryn Hahn) is the free spirited, liberated, whore.

If you can't laugh or maybe you aren't a single mom and you do iron your husbands under pants. Have fun with that. I would totally be friends with those 3 main characters. I thought this movie was humorous, realistic and a total must see! So to all you Gwendolyns out there, I'd be the Amy and take the stick from your butts and beat you over the heads with it! LIGHTEN UP CHICKS!",Bad Moms
294,grigorinikolov,"Sweet, predictive, sexist",6,29 January 2018,"I found that movie easy and funny, though it was kind of sexist. 
If you rely on that movie to create your own picture on how a family works, you could eventually reach to the idea that in a regular family only the wife is really working hard, while the husband is spending 10 months on online dating/jerking, and/or walking around the cafeterias during the day, just to find his wife chatting with her friends in order to humiliate her as she is not with her kids as she 'should be'. It turns out that only the moms are really caring about what's going on at school. There is only one father and he is a widow - duh how convenient. Otherwise, he should be divorced, but still cool. How this can be possible if his wife is not cheating or he is not a jerk? No, he is cool and she has just passed away, keeping the ideal for the working mom, now he need to replace her, which is not an easy task.
Anyway, if you like Mila Kunis or want a nice, sweet comedy, this could be a good option.",Bad Moms
295,tobeyg-52996,Can I please have that 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life back?,1,17 February 2018,"There's nothing bad to say about Bad Moms that hasn't already been said. So all I'm going to say is STX Entertainment, if you ever squeeze out a turd like this one that's too big to flush down the toilet, shove it back up where it came from. One of the worst movies I've ever watched.",Bad Moms
296,suehempel,terrible and far to overated,1,7 April 2018,I am so glad I didnt buy this and borrowed it instead. First 10 mins were ok but the persistent swearing got the better of me. I am no prude and some swearing is ok but it was overkill in this overated movie,Bad Moms
297,c-03526,Sign up to IMDB just to review this piece of crap,2,6 May 2018,"Just don't waste your time. 
It's a movie supposed to make you feel ok about being a clueless overgrown teenager with kids.",Bad Moms
298,surfin_gal,"This film should just be called ""bad""",1,15 October 2018,Upon an unfortunate series of events ( mainly my friends taste in films) I watched this film. She is lucky her I pad didn't go out the window. The only happiness I felt was when it ended.,Bad Moms
