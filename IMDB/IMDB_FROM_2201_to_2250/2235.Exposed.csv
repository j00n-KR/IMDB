0,Prismark10,Daughter of God,3,24 March 2016,"Exposed is a film that has been involved with corporate meddling. The production company did not like the director's cut and imposed their own version.The film has two narratives. One is in English, the other mainly in Spanish. You eventually realise that both parts are linked. I think the director was aiming for magical realism.Detective Galban (Keanu Reeves) is a widower who has also lost his partner. He goes through the whole movie looking glum. It turns out out that his partner was more than dirty, a thoroughly disreputable sort. His wife just cares that his pension remains intact. Galban's superior's wants to thwart the investigation in order not to ruin the department's good name.Secondly, there is a story of a Hispanic girl Isabel (Ana de Armas). She might also be the witness to Galban's partner's death. We see her in a lengthy scene going to an underground subway where she also sees an apparition. She is a religious girl and she lives with her husband's family who is stationed in Iraq.As a teacher she becomes protective with a little girl who might be living in an abusive home. During the course of the film Isabel becomes pregnant which she puts down as a miracle as her husband was stationed in Iraq for so many months. As the film goes on we are also exposed to Isabel's childhood trauma which has also become unleashed.There are also minor side plot involving a drug dealer suspected of killing Galban's partner going after the person who might had actually did it.The film is downbeat, I never understood why so much had to be in Spanish when the characters also spoke English. I think the Spanish language bits emphasised the supernatural/fantasy elements of the story.The film does eventually come together, there are hints that allow the viewer to tie up the gist of the story in advance. I think the original cut might have gone along the lines of a gritty and violent M Night Shyamalan story with a twist. What we get is rather uninvolving and also boring.",Exposed
1,nogodnomasters,Joey was no choir boy,3,23 February 2018,"Scotty (Keanu Reeves) is investigating the murder of his police partner Joey. As the investigation goes on Joey becomes dirtier. His wife (Mira Sorvino) proclaims, ""Joey was no choir boy."" Meanwhile Isabel (Ana de Armas) who is connected to one of the suspects is having visions. Her husband is in Iraq as she says the rosary daily for him. As time goes on, the over clued mystery open up.Keanu Reeves played a very bland character. They could have hired Christian Slater to do the part and saved some money. He was snooze-fest boring and not well developed. Isabel was an interesting up lifting person, eerily saintly in her actions helping the poor and children.This is a crime drama you can wait to see.Guide: F-bomb. No nudity.",Exposed
2,kosmasp,Knock Knock,3,22 November 2016,"Better not answer. Or rather watch that other movie with Keanu Reeves and Ana. It's more exciting in many ways. But joking aside, this movie tries to surround itself with mystery while it just feels like a mental puzzle, where no piece seems to fit the other. Even if you'd argue, that it kind of makes sense (and you even get a somewhat rare emotional outburst from Keanu) and it is twisted, this does not help the case - yes pun very much intended.Of course the explanation at the end should not come as a surprise, especially if you did listen and watched throughout the movie. But the two leads cannot carry this sort of movie, that has not the best script to begin with",Exposed
3,zardoz-13,Exposed Exposes Lionsgate's Ineptitude,1,3 April 2016,"Any time that a director has his name removed from a movie, you know something is deeply wrong with the film. Freshman writer & director Gee Malik Linton preferred to use the Alan Smithee-like pseudonym Declan Dale rather than his own name. ""Exposed"" exemplifies what happens when a studio intervenes in the editing of a film to change it so drastically that the director decides to disown it. Part gloomy police procedural and part dreary surreal saga, the incomprehensible ""Exposed"" generates little energy or enthusiasm. Keanu Reeves plays a widowed N.Y.P.D. Detective named Scotty Galban whose wholly unsavory partner, Detective Joey Cullen (Danny Hoch of ""Safe""), has died after being stabbed to death in the subway station under mysterious circumstances. Before he died, Cullen managed to snap some pictures of his suspected assailants. Now, our morose hero must contend not only with the grieving wife, Janine Cullen (Mira Sorvino of ""Mimic""), but also with his investigation that might expose Cullen's corruption and deprive Janine of Joey's pension. Galban's superior Lieutenant Galway (Christopher McDonald of :""Thelma & Louise"") points out that Joey had been under Federal scrutiny so nothing good can come from Galban's investigation. Naturally, Janine isn't happy that the department wants to bury the investigation. Indeed, she is furious, but she realize what the consequences could yield if Joey's past is brought up. As it turns out, she knows that Joey was ""no choir boy."" Actually, Galban knew that Joey was dirty. Janine wants Scotty to find who killed Joey, and she gets involved with him in an affair, too. Meantime, Scotty has little luck with his investigation. Witnesses wind up dead, and the only link in the case is Isabel. When ""Exposed"" isn't focused on the grieving Galban, the narrative shifts to a young, pretty Cuban nursery school teacher, Isabel de La Cruz (Ana de Armas of ""War Dogs""), who has visions of angels after the murder of the cop. Of course, these visions disturb our heroine. She is a deeply religious Latino. Forty minutes into ""Exposed"" neither Galban nor Isabel seem to be making any headway with their respective predicaments, and they have yet to cross paths. Galban is curious about Isabel because she appeared in one of the photos that Cullen took before he met his demise. Meantime, out of the blue, Isabel learns that she has become pregnant, despite the fact that her boyfriend is in the military serving overseas. Even worse her boyfriend dies in combat and her prospective in-laws force her to leave and go back to her parents since they believe that she cheated on him. As it turns out about 88 minutes into the film, Joey raped Isabel and she stabbed him to death. Before this happened, she dropped a ring that she had trouble keeping on her finger that has her name inscribed inside it. Later, Isabel stabs another man because he molested his daughter. ""Exposed"" might have been interesting how Lionsgate left it alone. The appearances of the white-haired Japanese angel that haunts Isabel are striking. Altogether, ""Exposed"" exposes Lionsgate's ineptitude. The production values, especially Trevor Forrest's exemplary photography, are outstanding, but they are of little compensation. Perhaps we'll get a chance to see what ""Exposed"" would have been had it been released under its original title ""Daughter of God."" The only real surprise occurs when a murderous African-American gangster is stabbed to death by one his victims.",Exposed
4,gradyharp,The title sums up the movie,3,16 May 2016,"Of great interest in considering the failure of this film, the following is about the director: 'Declan Dale is a pseudonym used much in the way that the name Alan Smithee was used for films that a director has disowned. Dale's only film is Exposed, a Keanu Reeves thriller that was significantly edited by Lionsgate Premiere without the original director's permission. The film, originally titled Daughter of God, was a surreal bi-lingual drama, reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth and Irreversible, that focused on child abuse, violence towards women, mass incarceration, and police violence committed under the color of authority. However, the executives at Lionsgate Premiere thought they had been sold a Keanu Reeves cop-thriller. To increase the film's potential box office, during the editing process Lionsgate changed the story's focus to center on Reeves' character, and changed the movie into a generic crime-thriller. The director disowned the film, using the pseudonym of Declan Dale. And apparently the same situation occurred with the writer Gee Malik Linton.Perhaps that is the explanation we need when we wonder how a film can be so scrambled with any sense of character development or meaning. The plot synopsis attempts to make sense of the story: 'Detective Galban (Keanu Reeves), finds his partner and close friend, Detective Cullen, murdered in an underground subway. On the hunt for the killer/s, Galban begins to suspect his partner may have been heavily involved in drug dealing and police corruption. As Galban investigates, people who knew Cullen, are conveniently found dead. The closer Galban gets to the truth, both Cullen's wife, Janine (Mira Sorvino), and his Lieutenant (Christopher McDonald), try to persuade him to back off, fearing his findings may discredit Cullen and expose corruption within the Police Department. Galban's only remaining lead is Isabel ((Ana de Armas), a young, devout, Latino girl, who resides with her in-laws. Galban fears her life could be in jeopardy should he get too close to her. However, Isabel has recently experienced something not from this world, something mystical that she believes is truly a miracle. Not unlike Galban, Isabel is dealing with her own demons from the past; a past that just may lead them to the truth...'Yes, the film is artsy and that usually is a plus – looming otherworldly spirits that alter the storyline, indecipherable conversations despite constant subtitles, etc – but in the end the film has been too manipulated by too many people and the result is - confused.",Exposed
5,siderite,A one hour and a half punchline,5,7 February 2016,"I have no idea why Keanu Reeves ended up playing in this film. He is at best a supporting character and a weakly defined one at that. Mira Sorvino makes an episodic appearance as well and her acting is one of the worst yet. What happened to you, lady? The only thing worth watching this film for is beautiful Ana de Armas. She's really cute: that's the only redeeming quality of this movie.The scenes take the viewer from one thread of the story to another, but without any transition or connectivity between those threads. For almost the entire length of the film it's like watching two intertwined movies that have no connection to each other; and both boring. By the end you know that there's going to be a revelation, but you are sick and tired of waiting for it. And when it comes it's one of those ""the perspective from which I was seeing the story was false from the start"".Bottom line: really weak story that brings nothing to the table. The acting is mediocre, the known actors in the film are there for the money, the mood is dark and despairing for no good reason, the ending teaches nothing, the twist is pointless, the story is fractured to the point where you don't understand who is who and why the hell they do what they do. This is the very definition of ""waste of time"".",Exposed
6,KineticSeoul,I was confused for all the wrong reasons,4,25 January 2016,"Well this was a bore fest from start to finish. During most of the screen time I was wondering where this movie was headed when it came to the plot. Now I like some movies where different stories collide with one another in a spectacular fashion. But that isn't the case for this movie. So the premise is about a woman that has a strong faith in God, but has her own struggles she is dealing with sees some supernatural stuff going on. Which actually seems pretty random at some points to the point I was in wonder for all the wrong reason. Then there is this cop played by Keanu Reeves who is trying to track down the people that killed his partner. Mainly because his partner's wife is constantly on to him about it. I seen Keanu be more emotionally invested playing a cop in ""Speed"" and ""Street Kings"" over this. So you can only imagine how his acting plays out in this until you see it...Let's just say Keanu didn't seem to care and lacked the enthusiasm that he had for his previous films. I really didn't care what was going on in this movie to be honest and I was willing to give it a chance. But all the interactions was far from being intriguing or interesting, just bland with nothing really innovative going on. It's like some really amateur wannabe director wanted to make some sort of stand out film with depth but failed. I didn't know what genre this thing was. It's like they meshed bunch of elements together but didn't know how to coherently make it work. If you want to see a movie that is a mess for all the wrong reasons, check this out if not, I highly recommend you pass on this one.4/10",Exposed
7,Hellmant,"It might have been a really good movie, if big business hadn't screwed everything up (again)",5,7 April 2016,"'EXPOSED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A crime-thriller, about a cop investigating his partner's murder; and a young religious Latina woman, who recently had an otherworldly spiritual experience. The film stars Ana de Armas and Keanu Reeves, who last teamed together in the 2015 Eli Roth helmed thriller 'KNOCK KNOCK'. The movie was written and directed by Gee Malik Linton; although he disowned the film, and used the pseudonym Declan Dale. Linton had originally intended for the movie to be a bi-lingual drama flick (called 'DAUGHTER OF GOD'), dealing with serious subject matter; like child abuse, rape and police corruption. Lionsgate Premiere, who purchased the film rights, thought they had bought a cop thriller though, starring Keanu Reeves; so that's what they edited the movie into. Linton was not happy with the finished project, and neither were the majority of critics. I agree, with Linton (and most critics), that the film is a mess.Detective Scott Galban (Reeves) is investigating the mysterious stabbing death of his partner; in a subway station. He uncovers some nasty information about the deceased cop; including police corruption involving rape. While he digs deeper into the case, he crosses paths with a young Latina woman, named Isabel de La Cruz (Armas). Isabel recently experienced a spiritual miracle; in the same subway station.The film definitely doesn't seem like a complete story; making Reeves' (who originally had a supporting role) the lead, definitely causes a lot of story structure issues (Reeves also doesn't give a very impressive performance in the movie). Ana de Armas is good in the film (so is Mira Sorvino, in a supporting role), and her character's story is interesting. It might have been a really good movie, if big business hadn't screwed everything up (again).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/n2qWxeZ0Tck",Exposed
8,cosmo_tiger,"Had the chance to be extremely important & conversation starting, but the ""American"" aspect of the film really ruined everything",6,22 February 2016,"""I don't want my Joey's name tarnished. You owe him that much."" Detective Galban (Reeves) is investigating the murder of his friend and cop. When he begins to investigate he learns that one of the only witnesses is a woman named Isabel (Armas). Isabel's life is a roller coaster and when she tells her boyfriends family about a miracle everyone looks at her differently. The more Galban and Isabel discover the more they wish they hadn't. This is a strange movie. The movie is almost two different movies in one. The Reeves section is just a generic detective movie that is not all that exciting. The Isabel section is extremely interesting and I would have rather the movie focused just on that rather than go back and forth. It almost felt like the producers were afraid because of the heavy subject matter and the subtitles, so they watered it down by adding the Reeves storyline. To me that really hurt the film and this could have been much more important instead of tamed down to the point of losing the emotional effect. Overall, a movie that had the chance to be extremely important and conversation starting, but the ""American"" aspect of the film really ruined everything that it tried to build up. I give the Isabel section of the movie an A, the Reeves section I give a C. As for the entire movie, I give it a disappointing B-.",Exposed
9,Reno-Rangan,I would like to try the director's cut; this one is a post-production disaster.,4,14 May 2016,"If you say it is the worst film of the year, I won't deny that. There are more substandard films than this, but having a big name like Keanu Reeves, it is a great disappointment. It was written and directed by an inexperienced filmmaker. That was a big challenge the production house has taken, and in the end it's a failed attempt. But that was not the actual reason for the disaster.Maybe the director's cut would have been better than this version. Because the actual film was a bilingual drama that reminds us classic cult films. But the production house decided to turn it into a money generating product. Due to that plan-B it went through the lots of cuts to turn it into a single story. In the end the 'lost in translation' happened. So that's answers why it was credited under a false director's name.It is hard to give an opinion on the story, because it's a confusing narration due to imbalance in the genres which is originally meant for two different stories. The twist was taken straight out of another film, so that makes the conclusion was very silly. First of all, Keanu Reeves' character was next to nothing. I don't understand how he ended up in this project. If his side story was chopped off, it would have made a decent short film and vice versa. I am sure, 8 out of 10 would feel a letdown and the remaining 2 might like it or maybe fall into a confused state.3½/10",Exposed
10,leonblackwood,Really not that great!! 2/10,2,30 April 2016,"Review: This movie was awful! I was expecting some in depth investigating from Keanu Reeves character, Scatty, whose trying to find out who murdered his partner but it doesn't go any were for ages and the characters were pretty dull. The writing was also pretty bad and I personally thought that Keanu Reeves was the worse choice for the lead, mainly because the dialogue isn't that great and the basic concept dries up after a while. The other main character in the movie, Isabel (Ana de Armas), just seems to wonder around in a trance for an hour and a half, and when the plot unfolds, I wasn't that impressed. The tone from the beginning of the film is really glum, which doesn't help the slow pace which was set from the get go. There isn't any action through the whole film and I didn't really get the point of the little girl or the strange white person who kept on popping up out of nowhere. I know that Isabel is going through an traumatic episode in her life but I still didn't get her weird visions and strange behaviour. For a film that is supposed to be a suspense/thriller, I certainly didn't feel thrilled after watching it, and it just seemed like a waste of time and money. Disappointing!Round-Up: After growing up listening to Big Daddy Kane's music, it was good to see that he was still alive but he really picked a terrible movie to star in. At 47 years old and with a successful Hip Hop career behind him, he has really starred in some poor movies, like the Metoer Man in 1993, Posse, Dead Heist, Love For Sale, Just Another Day, You're Nobody 'til Somebody Kills You, My Name Is Nobody and the upcoming Movie Madness. I'm yet to see if he really can act, mainly because his bad choice of projects but he definitely was one of the top rappers back in the day, with his unique style and suave personality. In this film, his character seemed a bit pointless because he was wrongly accused right from the beginning and you don't actually get to see him in his criminal element because he is constantly being watched by the FBI. Anyway, this movie was directed by Declan Dale who hasn't made a film before, or contributed to any project in the movie world. You can tell that his lack of knowledge when it comes to story telling, is his downfall and the fact that he wasted a decent cast, isn't the best way to kick off your career in cinema.I recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery/crime/dramas starring Keanu Reeves, Ana De Armas, Gabe Vargas, Christopher McDonald, Mira Sorvino, Big Daddy Kane, Sandy Tejada, Ariel Pacheco and Michael Rispoli. 2/10",Exposed
11,subxerogravity,Got to say nay on this one.,4,25 January 2016,"So as I was about to post this review, I noticed on the trivia page notes on exactly what went wrong with this film, cause something did go terribly wrong on this one, terribly wrong.The movie felt like one or two different movies, intertwined together really badly. The whole thing was all over the place with no real focus.It's really sad because the acting in the movie was really good and I love how the filmmakers placed the movie in the Inwood section of Manhattan. I recognize the area and it made the movie feel so real. Like with the characters going naturally back and forth from Spanish to English, it fells like Dominican New York. Not only that, but the cinematography and the sound design really helps to put you right there on the streets. From the sounds of the buses and cars going by to parts where it was cloudy and raining. I really felt I was on those streets and not in a theater. Plus Big Daddy Kane makes a rare acting appearance. How can this movie not be solid gold? Well apparently it was not enough for the studios to have Keenu Reeves on the poster to sell tickets, they had to re-edit the movie to make sure he was more the star of the pic, and this puts everything off, because you still realize that Reeves' role as a detective trying to solve his crooked partner's murder is a small piece of a movie about a a young devoted catholic living with her husband's family while he's overseas, trying to wrap her head around deeply distributing issues that are triggered by her own connection to the this cop's murder. So I herd that there is a director's cut of the movie. If that cut every comes to light, I would want to see what the filmmaker really was trying to do, but do not waste your time seeing this cut.",Exposed
12,arthur_tafero,HIdden Gem - Daughter of God (Exposed),8,1 September 2019,"About the only thing wrong with this film is the title; it is terrible. It should have been called the Daughter of God, which was a perfect title, not some lame generalist title, that was PC and not meant to offend various churches and church officials (none of whom would get this film, anyway). Other than that, the film is almost perfect, and I am a very demanding and cynical critic, who also happens to be an agnostic taoist. So, it would have been a piece of cake for me to pan this film like the vast majority of others (most probably for religious reasons), but I base my critiques on scripts (this one was great), character development (this film did a great job with that as well), direction and cinematography (once again, the film was almost impeccable), and some of the finest work ever done by Keanu Reeves, an actor with several hits as well as a few misses in the past. Why any unbiased movie critic would pan this film is beyond me. See it for yourself and then decide if the film captures Washington Heights, where I once lived. It recaptured it for me. It avoided needless chase scenes and mindless violence (unless it was germane to the plot), It is a multi-layered film, in the mold of Serpico and Donnie Brasco, rather than a mindless ""action cop"" film, which is probably why so many mediocre critics panned it. Mindless under-30s, who have no concept of film composition or complexity of a screenplay. They are not critics; they are wanna-be Hollywood formula addicts, and this film does not conform to their formulas. Forget about the other ratings; see the movie and decide for yourself.",Exposed
13,peterp-450-298716,Reeves disappoints in this chaotic movie.,3,11 March 2016,"""You know, he was very dirty. And, unfortunately, his dirt caught up with him. But at least his wife will get his full pension. Now, the more you dig the more you risk screwing up that pension for his wife and kids. And I don't think you want that on your conscience.""""Exposed"" isn't really a complicated movie. It just all seems quite arty and metaphysical. Throughout the film you ask yourself what in God's name is going on. What's the meaning of those appearances? How do the different story lines correlate? It started intriguing and mysterious at first, but gradually the whole film bogged down into a painfully slow psychological drama with not much to be seen. Several themes are intertwined with one another in an attempt to trick you and provide a surprising denouement. ""Exposed"" first looks like a typical crime film with the murder of a police detective. Then the second story is introduced, starring a deeply religious woman who's staying in such high spheres that angelic apparitions become part of her daily life. But in the background other tragic events are simmering with abuse as a base. Ultimately it results in a psychological thriller where a confused human psyche could be the cause. Surprising? Yes. But at that time, it was a bit too much.This movie won't make you really cheerful. Sadness is omnipresent. There's detective Galban (Keanu Reeves), who looks sad the whole movie. That isn't surprising. First he lost his wife and now his partner. And it seems that Galban's partner Joey surely wasn't a saint. On the contrary, totally corrupt. That's why Galban's investigation is being thwarted because one fears that the reputation of the department would be harmed. And also Joey's pension could well become compromised. Something Joey's wife Janine (Miro Sorvino) is entitled to. Next there's the Cuban girl Isabel (Ana de Armas), whose devout attitude is admirable on the one hand and on the other disturbing. The visions that she has, cause confusion. Are they the result of intensive religiosity? Or are they delusions which are the result of deep-rooted psychological injuries? As a kindergarten teacher she makes a connection with the lovely girl Elisa (Venus Ariel). This little girl also suffers from a not so ideal family situation. As you can see, it is all doom and gloom.Reeves wasn't so bad in ""47 Ronin"". And he was stunning in ""John Wick"". This dark thriller lends itself well to a figure like Reeves. That sad look. The indifference and numbness. And then there's a sudden personality change, after which he beats up someone while his child is watching. Unfortunately this sad, hopeless expression on Reeves face started to irritate. The acting wasn't really awful, but it also wasn't something to brag about. Ana de Armas acted much better. But even her magnificent performance, couldn't save this film.""Exposed"" is a mess with a confusing story. And not just because of the content. The whole film is edited confusingly. It jumps from one subject to another. A movie which is overloaded with symbolism. And I guess the makers had a hard time to choose from several ideas. What remains is an incorrect balance between realism and surrealism. It tries to mix the profound subject of religion with crime, corruption and sexual abuse. A blatantly failed attempt resulting in a boring film with no precise objective as a final result. And those angels also looked terrible.

17,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Exposed,3,21 February 2016,"Unknown director (with a pseudonym to boot). Generic title. Big name stars who you sense are doing it for a paycheck. Released by way of video on demand instead of theatrical. Sound familiar? It should. If you've seen reviews for movies like The Prince or Vice, then Exposed (my latest write-up) is embedded in that category. Yeah it's lousy like the aforementioned vehicles but in a different way. Vice and ""Prince"" have a sense of coherency. You can mostly follow their every beat. Exposed is just messy. There were times when I didn't know what it was that I saw. So OK, what were you thinking Mira Sorvino? What were you thinking Michael Rispoli? And Christopher McDonald, what the heck?Anyway, watching this thing is like viewing two different films at once. I don't know how to classify it. You could call Exposed a nonprofessional indie. You could call it a crime drama/supernatural charade. Heck, you could claim it to be a foreign language flick starring Keanu ""whoa"" Reeves (huh?). No matter how you interpret things, there's 102 minutes here that feel like 3 hours. When its best performance is given by a washed-up, recluse rapper (Big Daddy Kane), you know the proceedings are in trouble. When its opening sequence takes forever and sets a bad precedent for what lies ahead, you know the proceedings are in trouble. And finally, when its director doesn't want to reveal his (or her) actual name, you know the proceedings are in trouble. Exposed can easily be renamed, Excruciating.Speaking of said director, he may be a rookie or he may be a veteran. Either way, Declan Dale (or whatever his name is) lets you know it's amateur night right off the bat. It's clear from the opening credits (of Exposed) that he can't effectively set up a shot, can't frame a scene, doesn't know when to infuse a close-up, doesn't know where to put the camera, doesn't use a zoom out at the right time, and can't juggle his many, muddled subplots. Scenes in Exposed are either too long-winded or not nearly long enough. And Dale's editing team could have been a pack of monkeys and the audience wouldn't even know the difference. Tone is absent, dramatic momentum starts up only to get sucked into the wind, and laughable overacting comes on like gangbusters. I paid $6.99 to watch this movie on XFINITY. If I paid $1.50 for it on Redbox, it still would have been a bad investment.Filmed in an uncommon part of New York City, distributed by Lionsgate Premiere, and originally titled Daughter of God, Exposed jots back and forth to chronicle the lives of two different, combative characters. First we have Scott Galban (played by Keanu Reeves). He is your typical, doom and gloom detective. His wife passed away, his son has been taken from him, he has almost no friends, and his partner (Joey Cullen played by Danny Hoch) just got murdered in an underground subway. Galban against mild orders from his superior (Lt. Galway played by Christopher McDonald), investigates the reality of his partner's death. He goes around asking questions yet every witness he talks to, gets murdered. Second, there's Isabel de La Cruz (played by Ana de Armas). She's the only witness that Galban hasn't talked to yet. Her character is borderline schizo. She becomes pregnant by way of a miracle, she has visions of ghostly apparitions, there's a side plot about her husband being stationed in Iraq, and she ultimately wanders the film as though she's a lost puppy. Throughout Exposed, we as the audience see Isabel the most (even though her and Keanu's Scott are loosely connected). Many frustrating scenes involve Isabel, her family, and her friends constantly gabbing in Spanish (when all of them obviously speak English). As for Reeves, well we only discern his screen time in bits and pieces. His presence is never developed or consistent. Like I mentioned in the second paragraph, Exposed feels like you're watching two separate vignettes altogether. They're so unconnected from each other, it makes the film totally shapeless. When every plot element finally comes full circle (in the concluding clips), you feel the damage has already been done. Exposed ""exposes"" itself to be a real scrape. Rating: 1 and a half stars.Of note: A lot of death occurs in Exposed yet we never see it. Heck, we don't even view any of the actual aftermath. It's like the film is trying to be 1995's Se7en but is too lazy to explain how A led to B. Is it possible the studios didn't want to go over budget? Maybe. Is it possible director Dale didn't know how to make homicide scenes look believable? Maybe so. Or did the special effects crew run out of fake blood? Oh yeah, that's it. Yeesh! Also of note: I usually give Keanu Reeves a pass because a lot of moviegoers think he can't act. I've seen him do solid work in Point Break, Speed, and Street Kings. I know what he's capable of. In Exposed however, he hits a wall by showing us the ultimate, wooden moment. There's a scene where he sits in his police car, gets upset, shows frustration, yells at himself, and bangs his hands on the steering wheel.

19,quincytheodore,Betrayed by its own fragmented narrative,3,23 January 2016,"While Knock-Knock was a mishap, Keanu Reeves still carries the buzz from John Wick, so it's peculiar to see his new movie flies under the radar. It's soon apparent that ""Exposed"" has a rather jumbled presentation. The movie uses multi perspective style and it does try to deliver heavy subject such as abuse, but it's ultimately too broken to create any appropriate connection.The two perspectives are too messy, as though the screenplay or editing is done sloppily. Keanu's point of view is that of noir detective, although the investigation moves so slowly and erratically. Meanwhile Ana de Armas plays as a troubled wife who might just see some apparition. From the color tone, the pace and even the script, these two stories are utterly different.It's not to say that there's not an artistic goal in mind, it could have dealt with mature theme well, however the jarring shift is confusing to say the least. It would jump from festive vibe, to brooding case and suddenly to what seems to be psychological thriller with metaphor. This is a really odd direction and it doesn't have to be such, it feels as though the movie tries to needlessly overreach.Both the leads perform admirably, in some instances Ana de Armas looks amiable and Keanu Reeves still has his appealing presence. However, the plot is chaotic, there would be incredibly slow development and subplots, yet it would hasten abruptly in mere minutes. The few segments from other angles don't really pan out in the grand scheme, while its intended twist is hampered by over saturation of horror genre, which is odd to see in crime drama.This kind of sudden change is not uncommon, some thriller movies shifted to more action atmosphere for casual audience or some action flicks would be altered to accommodate more famous stars. Still, the extreme shift of tone here doesn't have any appeal instead it's only a distraction.""Exposed"" could have had a surreal depth for narrative, yet it's a just a confusing mess that barely has any charm and even that small spark is muddle with messy production.",Exposed
20,krocheav,What The....?,5,7 April 2017,"Given a stylish look by cinematographer Trevor Frost - along with a pensively down beat pace by New York born writer/director Gee Malik Linton, this movie seems at odds with itself. Linton disowned the finished picture following heavy editing alterations by the distributor. It seems we may never know who committed the biggest crime - the distributor, writer or director? Whoever it was nothing was gained, as it lost out big time. Lovely Cuban born Ana De Armas works hard in her difficult role of delusional child-care worker - with Keanu Reeves suitably restrained as a tough detective investigating his partners hidden past and brutal death.There are some genuinely intriguing moments (even haunting) but as the story unfolds it all becomes just too ugly. There's also far too many nasty sub-plots (all running simultaneously) to allow the average viewer to generate a great deal of focused interest. Would it have been any better if not interfered with? difficult to say but somehow, with one too many convoluted situations I don't assume so.Talented Cuban composer Carlos Jose Alvarez creates an evocative mood by using a female voice performing a mystical song without words, nice.Overall: If your taste runs towards confusing plot lines that may (or may not) all fall into place it might hold your interest - otherwise, unpleasant and ultimately disappointing.",Exposed
21,omendata,Poor Keanu has truly lost it...,1,11 October 2017,"Apart from the fact Keanu looked bored out of his skull in this actual disaster (or is that he looks that way in all his films now?), he actually has moved into production as he produced it - oh dear!!!All of the acting was wooden and laboured (no change for Keanu there then) and especially the eyebrow actress and i used the term loosely of Ana De Armas who has already proved many times that she quite simply couldn't act her way out of a paper bag but presumably as she is so attractive that is what counts as talent these days - how sad for the industry.And what is it these days with the subtitles and putting half the movie in a foreign language ie Spanish??? It isn't arty, it doesn't add anything to the movie; in fact it actually detracts from the movie as not everyone is literate these days or can keep up with subtitles.What I would like to know is why did they insert the red and white characters from Hunger Games lol as....presumably Angels; I say presumably because the whole story is complete unfathomable and the narrative is so disconnected its quite hard not to get bored and loose attention.This is by far the worst film I have seen since the worst movie this year in which Keanu also played one of his weirdest roles , the utterly dire BAD BATCH - one of the worst film I have ever seen and an exercise in artsy fartsy pseudo intellectual clap trap that some people actually bought into going by their reviews!

We worked out what was fantasy and what was real from that.That said, it was a poignant portrayal of people dealing with violence and tragedy in different ways. The side plots were intended to divert attention from the main plot and worked well within the overall construct.Ana de Armas is excellent in her portrayal of the tragic innocent.

Rapper Big Daddy Kane has a fairly big supporting role as a crimeboss and he's not too bad either.It should be noted though that there might be a director's cut coming out at some point because the studio decided that in order to sell it as a Keanu Reeves vehicle (who was only originally meant to be a supporting role) remove chunks of Ana De Armas and the Latino family's scenes and make it more thriller based where as the original intent was always drama.It still has plenty of that and I still think it works but I can imagine that the DC might be better (and more of a crowd pleaser).But it made the director so angry at the studio that he asked to have him credited under a pseudonym.Should also be noted though I suppose that sometimes the director doesn't know best in these cases either, for instance Tony Kaye had infamous fights with Edward Norton regarding the cut of American HISTORY X and that still turned out to be pretty good (not comparing the 2 quality-wise though just making a point).Now I should be noted to just shut up and let you decide if you want to watch it or not.",Exposed

28,in1984,The End Justifies the Movie,7,24 January 2016,"6.5 of 10. This is a film that, without the ending or a failure to comprehend the ending, feels like bad TV crime drama. Instead, it's a crime mystery turned psycho-drama, or vice-versa. It's difficult to say much more without giving away the best part of the film, the ending.For those familiar with Irreversible (2002), it's both intriguing and irritating in that it never seems to give credit to the film for a key aspect of the film's eeriness and plot. In fact, given the use of Spanish and an unclear initial setting, you wonder if you're watching a copy-cat film or something using it to simply for the sake of the look and feel for the first 5 minutes or so of the film.For Keanu Reeves fans, this is both Keanu's film and not his film. He produced it, but his role in the film is sparse and a mystery in itself until the end, which is good because he's still not able to control his voice to sound like something other than a West Coast or maybe Chicago cop.There's a great film in here, and maybe it will eventually be told properly so that it comes out better. As it is, you'll have to enjoy the little things, like the non-glossy view of a different part of New York City also comparable to the view of Paris you get from Irreversible, and capturing the elements of the implicit butterfly effect as it builds toward the end.",Exposed

The end credits.Even Reeves couldn't save this miss-mash of a piece. It's billed as ""Cop investigates his partner's murder..."" but the investigation part is thin on the ground and if you're thinking Law and Order police procedural you can forget it.The story follows a circuitous route, and no logical path. The ""clues"" such as they are are covered over by ghostly apparitions or weird occurrences, and it doesn't make sense. The story is not helped by odd chopping and changing of characters' action, names of characters not clear and the plot being non-existent. Characters' reactions and dialogue are unrealistic and stilted, conversation seems strained and the best performer was a Staffordshire bull terrier. The most relatable character was only seen on Skype (or similar). All explanatory dialogue was missing leaving you always guessing. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish, with subtitles, which usually doesn't bother me but in this it was just another thing that was difficult to follow in the film.If sexual assault as a topic is something you don't like in a film, avoid this.Keanu, as always, is the solid determined guy... again the grieving widow, troubled and unapproachable, shy and proper. However, his dialogue is even more monosyllabic than usual. The script is shocking; dull and un-imaginative. Together with the bad dialogue, the direction and editing are choppy and inconsistent, and all over the place.The film is depressing. Nothing good. Nothing charming or pleasing.

The death of her husband killed in action (hence the wedding ring lost during the rape) is the split from the only man who loved her, and the little girl she takes care of is of course her own self she mothers. The dead cop is her justified homicide with the knife her brother-in-law gave her for protection. The complaints about the disjointed plot construction miss the fact it is mostly perfect because the past and both shock and trauma caused by men that women should be able to trust are in memory shards until the trigger pulls everything together.

33,ginocox-206-336968,"Flawed, but has an intriguing whodunit at its core",6,24 January 2016,"""Exposed"" is flawed, but has interesting elements. The film was originally titled ""Daughter of God,"" directed by first-time director Gee Malik Linton. The original production was reportedly surreal, very political and multi-cultural. But financing fell through and the producers turned to Lionsgate, who invested in what they thought was a thriller centered on Keanu Reeve's character. The studio didn't feel the original film held broad audience appeal and re-cut it to conform to the film they thought they had invested in. Subsequently, Linton disavowed the film and sued to have his name removed from his only theatrical credit. The final result reflects the production's uneven genesis. There are two story lines, one in Spanish with subtitles and another in English, which interweave and ultimately merge. Two other story lines seem a bit disjointed and incomplete, presumably due to wholesale cuts. The story lines share a common theme concerning reluctance to pursue the truth for fear of the consequences. One character was severely traumatized by a childhood experience. Current events conspire to push this character over the edge, compelling a response to the inner turmoil. Another character seeks to uncover the truth about a friend who was not the person he thought and who had secrets he would rather not have learned. There are also a few surrealistic events that don't make much sense, but may have made more sense in the original version. And an individual's death leads to unexpected consequences. The underlying whodunit is intriguing with some satisfying twists. The truncated subplots provide ample red herrings, although they aren't entirely satisfying. If the film had been shot as detective story, the writer and director would have taken markedly different approaches. What we have is a bit of a hodgepodge that affords glimpses of the story that it might have been. If the director and writer had concentrated on the mystery rather than the social commentary, they would have had a much better film. Having not seen the original film, I cannot comment on how effective it was as a social commentary, although it reportedly received generally favorable reviews from the preview audiences.",Exposed

This movie is just rubbish, in so many ways. Directing, acting, story, script, editing... Shoddy. The concept is AMAZING... The execution however, appalling.Sure, Joey was taking pictures of Isabel, followed her, raped her, then she killed him. How the story was told though was; Isabel is extremely religious, saw an angel and became the Virgin Mary. The rape story was COMPLETELY omitted, and not ONCE hinted, until the VERY end and the Elisa gambit/illusion was shattered halfway through the movie, when what seemed like another human being, acknowledged Elisa. In hindsight, the dots connect, but, the picture revealed is, disjointed.

The only reason to watch this movie is to watch Ana de Armas as Isabel. The best way to do that is to turn the sound off and keep the FF button at the ready and only watch those scenes she is in. When she is happy, you are happy; when she is sad, you are sad too. She is a joy to watch and very pretty too. As for the story the director pulled a fast one on us. Detective Galban sees Isabel's picture from his partner's camera and he knows somehow she is involved or knows what exactly happened to his partner who had a knife in his back that killed him. So we watch Galban flounder around until near the end when the Director finally fills us in what really happened to Isabel at that train station. Sad. Very sad. Galban and we had nothing to work with for most of the movie. The Director kept us all in the dark.No, Keanu Reeves does not play a John Wick character or anyone remotely like John Wick (great movie btw).

43,angiris,A wonderful and special film about how our minds can lock us away from harms way and take a drastic turn in the future.,6,22 January 2016,"We carry our pain and it shapes us more than we sometimes realize. This movie highlights one of such instances. Without patience, psychological understanding and an open mind you will not enjoy the way this movie has been directed, nor the cinematography in play here. The film will have you wonder often about why and where in the story we are and why certain figures manifest in a way which I personally find this to be a beautiful journey through a mind suffering from profound trauma.A trauma so horrible it has lead to de Armas character completely sealing her own real self away due to not being capable of dealing with it. A problem we humans do very very often due to our basic response to bad things. We make use of our defense mechanisms to avoid what hurts us inside. That is what we see here... and how it finally ends. Symbolism, metaphors and endless questions can arguably be a problem for the typical viewer here so be warned about these factors being a big part of understanding this, dear readers. I don't want to spoil the plot of the movie. I only wish to highlight certain key factors which are very nice (if not truly useful) to help understand this movie's story and directing. If you are patient and paying close attention to factors I've mentioned you will begin to see a pattern. A pattern with loop holes at first... but all will be closed and explained in the end. The reason for my not wanting to reveal more of the story than what the description says is to flat out not ruin the whole point of watching it :) I will however give you this, dear viewer. A teaser if you will. We are following two characters in this films. Two people who's destiny is intertwined. One, a woman named Isabel who's living a troubled but optimistic life which is full of strange miracles and wonders which we try to understand. The other, a troubled police officer named Detective Galban who's trying to find the truth behind his partners murder which leads to discovering a lot of very very ugly truths concerning his partners past... as well as a coincidence with Isabel. All of which will shock you upon figuring out the truth. I won't say more :) By the end of this journey we finally understand that Anna de Armas portrays a woman who would not stand for her being harmed ever again and her character acted out in a partially conscious/subconscious way which she herself fully aware simply could not manage to accomplish. Again, the defense mechanisms I mentioned from the beginning. Its fascinating to grasp how its all connected both psychologically and finally story-wise as well. Psychologically this movie is fascinating to watch. It might not be the case if particular viewers cannot follow down path the movie goes. Thus viewer discretion is advised. By my rating I give this a 6 out of 10. I find to to be well above average and by fair a great film. But its still arguably feeling a little rushed at times which arguably hinders more story from unfolding and possibly granting more insight into an ending a little cryptic if you don't really remember whats said by the key actors through the film. It culminates into grandeur for sure. But it leaves arguably a little too much for you to figure out yourself. If this is good or bad... is entirely up to you, dear reader. I personally think a few more details could have given it a 7 out of 10 rather than a six. Maybe if they had used another 20 minutes or so. Reaching that nice round 2 hour number. But yes. Thats my view.But rating aside I find it to be quite a work of art in a psychological and definitively in a cinematography-wise sense. It's a beautiful movie if you like exploring/going through a movie's story this way. If you prefer everything to be much more auto-explanatory then this might not be your film. Just the same. You should give it a shot if you feel like broadening your horizon. Good film. Im glad to see Anna de Armas and Keanu Reeves starring together once more. But that's of course because I loved Knock, Knock. By the end of the day you can choose to watch it if you feel like it or not. If you are unnerved by the very negative review above you can always use a free movie site instead due to fear of wasting money. Either way. I believe this could be of great interest to those intrigued by psychology and of course fans of Reeves and de Armas.",Exposed

Dale = clearly, red flag warning number two!): note, it's current title is more or less meaningless, but his original title more or less gives the game away as it is when the final denouement plays out, you'll highly likely be left with trying to think / work out, did it really all fit together (No it didn't!):Most unfortunately, with the addition of Reeves, the producers, scriptwriters - or someone* - moved the focus to him, but he has no palpable character arc; if not his - alleged - wooden acting style, then clearly on display is simply evidence of just how adrift he found himself in this not quite held together, not mess, but half cocked effort. Even Mira Sorvino is sorely underused in a what surely should have a been a pivotal part to the plot Linton originally set out, but here is unforgivably reduced just to a throwaway tryst role for Reeves. Pity, for the gorgeous Ana de Armas - (the reason I ran across it) - not only otherwise carries the whole 'mystery', but gives a fabulous, convincing performance as the wronged / mistreated ingénue to keep your eye on: when it all comes out (!) what is going on with her, she puts in a truly painful, difficult to watch portrayal (á la 'Irreversible' like.)
One to watch to think what could have been if not interfered with by the filmdom powers that control! ** See the Trivia notes: seems, blame 'Lionsgate Premiere' for the travesty.

The film has an ethereal mood with religious overtones and well developed sense of Spanish family. The acting is fine (Reeves is certainly more nuanced than the John Wick cartoon hyper violence) and the plot more developed than many bigger budget efforts.

It seems at first disjointed and unusual, but then gradually towards the end we see that the focus of the story is different from that first portrayed and actually the film is about something completely different.Appears some people didn't like this, but to me it was very original, interestingly designed and definitely worth the watch. I was not bored at any point, and indeed intrigued. I wondered whether I was going to be let down by the story, but actually the ending was far more interesting than I imagined. Good acting, especially by the female lead.Can't say any more other than the story is not what you first expect.",Exposed

Two examples of the confrontational paradoxes in this movie are: (1) both truly good & extremely bad in one and the same person; (2) our mind does & doesn't work for us.You SHOULD watch this movie when you're interested in these themes and because they're presented in two very moving stories that were written in an intellectually challenging way.

The writer and director of 'Exposed',Gee Malik Linton, removed his directorial credit after the studio re-edited his movie. The film wasn't even supposed to be called 'Exposed', the original title was 'Daughter of God'.The ""director"" of this film is listed as Declan Dale, who is not even a real person. You know a film must be bad when the director publicly disowns it. But I personally think that the film still would have been bad without studio interference. The director had complete creative control while filming, it was just out of his control when it came to how the film was edited. The story wasn't interesting, the acting wasn't consistent, and there were just some laughably bad moments throughout the film. Without spoiling anything, the plot line with the ""mysterious figure"" was astonishingly bad. Every time the ""mysterious figure"" showed up, I found myself shaking my head. Just the design of the figure is cringe-worthy enough. Also, the film just ends abruptly, without any resolution.

The female really plays the lead role and Keanu is the 'canvas' which takes almost the viewers perspective of initially not understanding what happened. However, the film makes perfect sense and the surreal parts tie into the final conclusion. Don't read any parts with spoilers - the twist is worth it. I'm not a Keanu fan really but his role is ideal here, as in understated detective. Not a film for adolescents, children or action movie fans, but is a film for people that like an interesting story told in a novel way and relates to a woman with a problematic life.

Throwing in the illusion effects I found distracting and the drug dealers story line too, but I understood the reasoning was because it was two separate stories that collided. It's like some people are born to be victimize all their lives. I'm surprise she turned out as well as she had, however it was probably due to the fact she blocked her childhood out until she was traumatized again.There is two stories going on here with one common factor, a murdered cop in the subway station. I think if you don't have high expectations as to what you want it to be and appreciate it for what it is you will enjoy it more. If you have any aversion to the strictness of Catholic religion you probably will not enjoy this film because it plays a roll in setting up the story and the use of the illusions which I don't know why these ""beings"" were chosen to look like they do.

The other lead in this movie, Ana de Armas, is a revelation. But what kept me watching was the superb cinematography by Trevor Forrest. I was expecting to see a B-movie - instead, I saw a polished work of film art. So, it's odd to read that this is the re-edit disowned by the director. Since the end of the movie came as a real surprise to me, if the original cut is ever released, it won't have the same impact, unfortunately. It's easy to ridicule a film like this because it takes so many chances. It's not perfect, by any means, and the story of one character, at least, is rather unresolved.

The movie shows a side of America that we don't see too often, a country where different ethnic groups live very different lives and the culture clashes that occur when their paths cross. My only objection is really the main actor. Keanu Reeves must be the least charismatic person in the history of acting. It's actually embarrassing to watch him.

There's good guys and there's bad guys. This movie ain't that. This movie does keep with a familiar theme though, angels, devils, heaven, hell, and of course, wickedness. But the problem is that it is a story told in a very unsatisfying manner. If you walk away, after seeing this movie, with a satisfied feeling, you are a very strange person. I'm tempted to give it 2 stars, because of the feeling of emptiness when the movie ended. But the actors did a credible job at telling the tale. The production values are good and the movie did fit into a certain genre, it's just that I felt worse for seeing it. If you love Keanu, you'll stick with it.

Well, another reviewer stated that they felt like they were watching TWO totally different movies that had nothing to do with each other and it gets tiresome and stretched out because the movie doesn't tell you what they had to do with each other till the very end. I literally felt like I was watching a subtitled Spanish movie about religious people and a completely different movie about detectives/ law enforcement and gangs.And even then the movie jumps around to much. They spend time explaining weird things that don't really help the flow of the movie and skim over the important stuff like when people die... I turned around and asked my boyfriend ""what just happened?"" or ""how did they die?"" too man times to enjoy the movie. And don't get me wrong I am a huge movie geek! I understand subtlety and subtext and I love a movie that makes me feel a genuine emotion... but the only emotion I got from this movie is CONFUSION! Even when you do get to the end of the movie the explanation for whats been happening is not enough of a ""payoff"" (if you know what I mean) ....its feels like ""I've watching this weird ass movie till the end to find out what these two stories have to do with each other and this is IT!??!?!?"" And the truly weird thing to me was Keanu's horrible acting in this. I know he's been accused of being ""too wooden"" in his performances but this was just hard to watch. There is a scene with him getting frustrated at himself for being a bad father where he screams and hits himself...the acting was so bad I was laughing. If the movie would've just stuck with Keanu and the gangs (especially that gang leader ""Black""??) and worked on why Rocky went to jail/prison and why it would've been much better. In the end they don't even get into why the dead detective was the way he was and why. And why didn't his wife do anything about it if she knew the horrible things he was doing on a regular basis? The ONLY reason I am giving this movie TWO stars instead of ONE is because I like the costumes on the ""visions"" she was seeing (they reminded me of Jim Henson-ish type stuff) but that in itself seemed so out of place and weird in this movie.I was sitting there and saying to myself WTF is going on?

And even with this he blended perfectly as an ordinary NYC detective investigating the murder of his partner in the police department. The supernatural aspects integrated well with the psychological nature of this young woman and her trauma. The day to day in the Spanish speaking community in NYC was relatable although tragic in this particular tale.

There is a few other story lines that don't really add to the film in my view, the gangster, the tramp, the affair with the deceased's wife and the visions!

The next day, a crooked police officer is found dead in the same subway station, and one by one, all the associates of the woman disappear or are murdered. She herself begins to witness surreal visions which increase in frequency when she befriends a small girl she suspects to be a victim of sexual abuse.This movie had the makings of an intriguing plot, as the story expands and we learn more about the various characters and how they are, or may be, related. Unfortunately, the makings of a plot do not equal a plot itself, and this is never more so the case than when the studio edits the film to try to create suspense and mystery that should have been inherent in the original screenplay. The endless flashbacks, vision sequences, and out-of-chronology scenes add nothing to the film but confusion and, oddly enough, tedium. They take a better-than-average premise and turn it into a mess of a movie, saved primarily by the few nuggets of genuine creativity in the plot and the looks and acting of Ana de Armas and the cast who portray her family members.I gave this film 6 stars, solely because I felt the current consensus of 4.2 is absurdly low.

Isabel is a pleasure to look at, so lovely, clean and faithful and I was never bored when she was on screen. Galban on the other hand was a lead weight, bumbling his way through both his investigation, personal life, and sex with Sorvino. Mira Sorvino injected a little life into the non-latin side of the film, but suffered from acting opposite Keanu and dull film quality.

Without spoiling the movie for whites, I'll just give a few examples. First, the movie would have you believe that a Black person that speaks Spanish is not really Black. Everyone in his family looks like they're from Mexico EXCEPT him, but we're not supposed to see him as a Black man. Blacks speak ALL languages and a Black person that speaks Japanese is NOT Japanese either. Since most people are confused concerning the difference between race and ethnicity, the writers take advantage of that. Secondly, they have tired, old, Keanu Reeves brutalizing an innocent Black man IN FRONT of his woman and child in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The scene has no relevance to the plot. It just serves as the typical anti-Black subliminal message that leaves a subconscious imprint in the viewer's mind that reiterates the American mantra that Black lives DON'T matter. It gets horribly bad after this, and you'll see the typical drug-selling Black male characters come out and do their part to create hate of the Black male too. I'd stop there, but it gets worse. An albino white man is meant to personify Jesus Christ as he defies gravity and walks on air, this time. LOL!! Trust me, it gets worse but I'll stop here so I don't ruin it for the whites who buy into this kid of garbage.People of color, avoid this crap film at all costs and look for me to critique movies from a minority perspective in the future.

Not to spoil the end, but that innocence is pretty important to the plot. She never failed to keep me interested even as the rest of the movie fell apart around her. The filming and camera work was also wonderful. As for the plot... It's hard to give a solid review knowing that the director was not happy with what the producers (Lions Gate) ultimately ended up doing to the film but we do have to review what we are given, alas. (That said, I would love to watch the original uncut film). I understand now the purpose behind so many subplots and how things tie together in the end but can't help but feel it could have all been done better. And some sub plots should have just been left on the cutting room floor. The whole bit of Keenue and his partner's wife for instance. Yawn. And the bit with Keenu's kid.. another yawn. For that matter, Keenu should have been left on the cutting room floor. I sometimes really enjoy his stilted acting in films that it works, like the Matrix or John Wick, but in a move that really demands some serious deep work such as this one I think he falls way short.As for the strange beings... OK, I can go along with them but I cant help but feel the hallucinating dream like quality worked better in the original. Except for the the man in the subway the women just kind of didn't fit.

Well, I guess I had awaited something similar to Street Kings or so (don't get me wrong – I LOVE Street Kings but I wasn't sure why Keanu Reeves would do another cop movie ). But it's VERY different! It started out a bit slow and it is a slow movie in the positive sense, not your average action packed cop movie. And what it's definitely not: it's not 'racist' or 'whitewashed' as it has been accused of! Not to me at least. The vast majority of the actors as well as the characters are colored, black or Latino and they are speaking Spanish or some slang difficult to understand for me as a non-native speaker. And it's also definitely not a movie that focuses on Keanu Reeves as THE STAR. Not at all! After having watched the film I'm more than ever convinced that DAUGHTER OF GOD is the far more fitting title for what the movie is about. Well, you might already guess that I'm impressed by DAUGHTER OF GOD, I really am and I can't understand which problems the director has with the final version I have seen. It's another of those movies which won't be among my favorite Keanu Reeves movies (as it isn't a KEANU REEVES movie – another unfair reproach). Perhaps Keanu Reeves even plays a bit too subdued but there are so many emotions on his face when shown in close-up! WOW!

All I'm certain of is that this was one of the most haunting films I've seen in a decade. I've had difficulty putting it out of my mind, and have had conversations with my wife about it; not something that comes after Star Wars.I came away thinking that the film is about trauma. There's a victim of serial child abuse from a father, and who tragically is raped as an adult and a little later loses her husband when he is killed in a nonsensical war.We have the wife of a police officer who dies on duty. We have his 'partner', i.e. Colleague, who is fighting the death of his wife and is conflicted by the fact that his partner was corrupt.So we have mental conflict, trauma, abuse, death and loss. It's not a life-affirming film.The victim is thrown out from the committed Catholic family of her husband, who pray all the time, but when she tells the she is, in her mind, miraculously pregnant, they don't believe and she's not believed, and forced to return to her parents, including the abusive father. It doesn't end well.The police officer, Reeves, is falling apart in front of our eyes as he struggles to act responsibly and in accordance with his oath, despite no one else caring. The victim becomes his focus as he knows there's a connection between her and his partner. It doesn't turn out to be as he expected.The victim of the abuse/rape is in denial; it's a way of coping, but not a sensible one as it eats away at her, consuming her in the way the ring does its bearer in the Ring trilogy. In Exposed, we fear that the woman will fall apart. The struggle she has to cope ties the story together.Anyone who has had anything to do with victims of traumatic crimes or incidents might well interpret the film as I do.

The movie plot can be summed up in one long sentence. The acting is pretty spotty apart from the lead actress who does a decent job. The script is pretty robotic sounding and Keanu Reeves delivers his usual robotic performance which he does so well and it fits the character that it's actually OK. The movie has it's moments, uses music effectively at times and does portray life as not always being neat and packaged like a lot of Hollywood movies mistakenly do and lose their interest by being artificially black and white. I lower the score from a 6.5 to a 4 though because the movie's underlying message is pretty bad.It seems to excuse murder as being OK or even good.

Not only does it take waaayyyy too long for the story to start making rational connections to Reeves' and Armas' characters--by the time it does, I have begun to lose any real interest--but there are also too many pointless subplots I feel are just serving as filler. BUT, my number one complaint here is the fact that THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONTENT WARNING! Not to go into too much detail with strangers, but I have been living with PTSD for the better half of my life from sexual violence. Therefore, I rely on movie production companies, or whatever source is going to provide access to watch their productions (i.e. Netflix), or, any online movie review or information database sites that are supposed to give the rundown on films (i.e. IMDb), to provide accurate and clear content warnings (i.e. WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULT) about films that contain depictions that could potentially trigger somebody's PTSD symptoms. I am calling Netflix out for not screening for these things and warning their customers, even if the primary production company should have been the first to provide such warning. I also, obviously, hold the producers of this film accountable for failing to consider why it would be crucial to include a content warning (there are too many contributors to the production of this film to list here). Furthermore, IMDb, you failed here too. Even if the aforementioned entities failed to do their part, YOU COULD HAVE! It's not like you don't know the plot?!

If you come to this film based on the synopsis of a bad cop and revenge, you will be disappointed. But if you have an open mind and love films, you will understand this director doesn't want to tell you the story but let you experience it and find out what really happened.
This is a masterpiece in story telling, and amazingly we watched it again the next day only to make sense of the hints that were being dropped along the way. It is that good a film, that it works better after you've discovered what happened in the end.
Some confuse the spiritual and psychological aspect of the film as sci-fi, but you need to have read more than comics to come to this film and appreciate a masterful piece of work.",Exposed

183,tboarder-gx,Incredible,2,23 January 2016,"This movie was incredible; incredibly bad.Never before has someone so cleverly taken two separate stories, and ram them together with the elegance of a head-on car crash. The overall structure of the film felt like patch-work, moving from one scene to another within a matter of 10-30 seconds. As you absorb each scene, attempting to find some correlation to the previous one, they'll whip it away from you, leaving a bitter taste in your memory that will only grow as scenes pile up. It's like waiting for a surgeon to perform a delicate operation on your loved one, and the local butcher walks through the door with his cleaver. It's painful. I was really hoping there were some subtle or underlying meanings to some of the scenes, but in the end I found myself looking to my wife for comfort and explanation, only to be met with an empty confused stare.I never did work out what the dog death scene was all about.It would seem as though key inspiration was drawn from student films and the familiar ""patching"" of loose ends. If information was missing, throw a 10 second scene to tie it up... no one will notice.I gave it a chance, hell, I watched the whole thing, and at this point I really wish I'd stuck with my gut instinct in the first 10 minutes to hang up the gloves and just get an extra few hours of sleep.

184,dragonfire_power_818,Corporate meddling at it's finest,1,24 January 2016,"I had no idea what this movie was trying to accomplish. Honestly, I don't. I'm certain it was trying to go for cerebral, but I've seen home movies on flip phones with more coherent plot twists than this. The first hour was nothing but disjunctive cut scenes sporadically placed with no relation or relevance to each other. Most were emotional gotcha's that did nothing to move the plot forward. Someone asked about the dog scene, why stop there? Why did we even bother talking about the cop's kid? Or the hooking up with the dead partner's wife? Or the guy going around killing supposed witnesses? None of that mattered at all in this film. You could have removed all of that and it wouldn't have impacted the story in the slightest. The pieces that were relevant were edited and whittled away because once you sat through an excruciating hour of mind numbing inanity, the ending, which happen to reveal itself around the same time as the plot, was so utterly predictable. I could not understand how anyone would want to put their name to this drivel. Then when I looked up IMDb I found this gem: ""The writer/director fought to have his name legally removed from the movie."" Really, you should read the trivia, it's quite telling. Basically this movie should have been 'The Machinist' meets 'Pan's Labyrinth' in regards to telling an intriguing story, but instead Lionsgate decided that garbage with a big name actor stamped on it would somehow salvage yet another overarching reach of stifling creativity.",Exposed

But all was not lost. There were even hints of greatness. The story that counted, that of Isabel and Elisa, was told heartbreakingly well, and that is the story that I will take away and remember from this production. Magical realism is not always, and in fact, when I think about it, seldom is, sweetness and light. it is a concoction, an overlay, created by a fevered unconscious that has been, at one time or another, shattered so badly it had to recreate itself. In the story of Isabel and Elisa, we are observers of that process.

Anyway, I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to after seeing this. I'm not even really sure where to begin.... Was it the terrible story line, the abysmal film editing that just jumped to another part of the story without reason or was it just the bad acting??? Hence my title, ""WOW. Anyway here's my rundown; The story is about a pretty girl called Isabel, a cop who's partner/buddy has been murdered, a little girl (that I think was Isabel in the end), a few black guys, a weird spirit thing and a white dude with weird eyes that can float about subway station rail lines. I'll cut the chase, yes its that bad... The story, or lack of, jumps forward really awkwardly to a new scene so you just sort of gather, ""oh he died"" or ""oh she got raped"", or ""oh it was him"". e.g, Isabel's husband was in the US forces in an Iranian country. She used to talk to him on Skype with all his family gathered. She really loved him and lived with his family. He told her he was coming home in a week. Bang he's dead, in a coffin and she's burying him.... There was more emphasis of all the family being on Skype talking to him for more of the time that the minute or so that you found out he's died and they'd buried him. The film seemed to drag out the story in most of the scenes and then jump the story forward because need to shorten to be faster to get past the bits that are important and relevant to the story... OK what I have said doesn't really make sense???... Thats basically how the film make you feel and how it runs!!Anyway, its bad.... See it your own peril, then you'll agree.",Exposed

Sad or serious, it's always the same inappropriate silly face, she need to find another job soon!!!Third thing, it's not a professional movie, more like a student project with lot of flaws. The movie is slow, the acting is really bad and not convincing (except for Sorvino and Reeves whom are real actors with experience) nothing interesting in the multiple stories and when the final reveal happened, it's like they had to finished that mess and throw it like this in the last 15minutes...Last, if you don't like reading subtitles, too bad because almost 80% of the movie is in Spanish. Maybe it was not even supposed to be release in English idk but it's weird they didn't advertised it like it is since the main 2 stories (the latino dude with the black gang and the abused latino girl) are in Spanish and clearly inspired and done for a latino and black audience.Do yourself a favor if you are a Keanu Reeves or a Mira Sorvino fan, don't watch that movie, even the best actors make bad choices and that one of these.",Exposed

Nevertheless, it's a good story, and as another viewer pointed out, it's really not about a murder investigation.

(Well, maybe it's just me...) ANA DE ARMAS' performance - if you don't appreciate it, I can't help you.THE GOOD: Keanu Reeves could only work with the precious little he was given. His performance was far better than could be expected under the circumstances.THE BAD: Some obscure symbolism and some strangeness is provided to tease the intellect, but any explanation or relevance must have been expunged along with enlightening scenes from a subplot and left in a dumpster somewhere.Some scenes mystify by their unhelpful presence, making as much sense as the question: ""Would you like a lug-wrench with your fries?"" THE UGLY: The dog is an unnecessary non-sequitur - ignore it.Used to sequence scenes present within each chapter frequently the grammar of Yoda was. Hmmmmmm. Erratic.THE RESULT: Incoherence beneath a veneer of mysticism, with any glue to make the structure solid removed.THE CONCLUSION: Your mileage will vary. If you like filling in your own gaps with your own imaginings, you should be happy. If you paid for a story to be told (given that it will be a little hard to grasp) you might feel ripped.A new low in possibly its own new niche. Cinema courses will rejoice.It could have been good.

Lions Gate films gutted and re-edited this movie to focus around Keanu, when the movie wasn't supposed to.

It gets 3 stars because I like Keanu and Ana de Armas is cute.1.) The title of this movie is called Exposed but the beginning creds and at the end it flashes ""Daughter of God"". Title consistency is not there. so what's the name of the movie again? Secondly, how does Exposed relate to the storyline? Who is exposed? 2.) 80% of this is in Spanish and there was no hardcode of subtitles for the parts where they were speaking it. If you're going to have language other than English, you need to cover that.3.) SPOILER: The trailer implies the movie is about a detective who's partner has just been killed and this girl (Ana de Armas) has something to do with it. Throughout the movie, the story focuses on this character Isabelle who was raped by Keanu's partner (which they reveal at the end) but add in these nonsensical parts that have no relevance to the movie like ""black Jones"" played by Big Daddy Kane, and Rocky played by Gabe Vargas. There's a bit of complexity where the Department knows of Keanu's partner's corruption but still don't see the relevance in that either and how it ties in w/ the overall plot. Its a story that needed more work and refinement. Not sure how Keanu even agreed to do this movie, maybe he was just bored and needed something to do? A movie not worth watching unless you want to just play it in the background and listen to Spanish dialog.

I must admit in the beginning the movie cuts from scene to scene to scene with what feels like (even now) no conceivable order, but you get used to it. I just felt like I had to come on here and give this movie a good review to give some counter balance.Is this the best movie that I have ever seen? No, but it's in no way one of the worst.

219,ctfbaby,good movie,7,24 November 2016,"first off for all the ignorant people out there that say this movie was so horrible that the director took his name off, do your research.the director removed his name because this movie was originally title daughter of god. it had nothing to do with keanu but lions gate edited this movie poorly and put keanu for sales and marketing.there is an ongoing petition to release the directors cut of this movie. the only real way of watching this movie is by seeing it the way the director wanted us to see it not the lions gate edited version so don't blame the director blame lions gate films. in MY OPINION it was a good movie i usually don't read reviews because the only person that would know if you like something is you and YOU only so give this movie a chance and hopefully we get to see the directors cut.",Exposed

221,justelmakra,What Happened?,3,26 June 2019,"I couldn't finish watching the film. In fact. I wondered myself if that actor was really Keanu!!! Whatsapp happened to him!? Why this film? Was It a friendly action ? Too long, too slow, too much to bear when you know he si a good good actor... but he never showed Up.",Exposed
222,bwppdkzn,Don't Press play!,1,15 April 2017,"So, I'm 30 years old. I've never reviewed anything in my life publicly. But, this movie is so awful, that i see it as my duty to warn anyone who might want to see this movie.I thought Keanu Reeves was a guarantee stamp for quality, but now I'm wondering if he is broke since he participated in this movie?This movie is disgrace for all movies, there is no plot or anything, it's literally bullshit and clichés.The director must had been taking some hallucination drugs, since he/she lost track of what was going on!It's amazing that the people involved in this movie didn't stop it from being released!Never ever have I wasted my time that bad. Seriously, spend some time with your wife/girlfriend etc. Instead, make some food, let it be today, instead of watching this awful movie.",Exposed

225,mrock-62750,Not the mess I expected,7,27 August 2019,I read all the bad reviews and am a little surprised at the vitrial aimed at this movie. Keanu Reeves kind of sleep walks through his role but the heroine is believable and a beauty to say the least. The storyline is convoluted and drawn out but satisfies me in the end.,Exposed
226,spencer_s,"Deep, Thought-Provoking Study on Trauma and Loss",9,16 August 2019,"First, what this movie is NOT:
If you are looking for a fast-paced kick-ass Keanu Reeves protagonist wreaking mayhem on the bad guys stop reading. Look for a different movie. This is not for you.
However, if you are open to the idea of an action star stepping outside his normal genre (think Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense) then this movie might be for you.
This movie looks at how trauma and loss effect people differently as they try to make sense of a crumbling world.
Isabel, the main character is trying to deal with trauma that occurs not only during the movie, but earlier in her life.
Galban (Keanu Reeves character) is trying to unravel the brutal murder of his detective partner. Suspects and potential witnesses all end up dead. Also, in a scene that lasts about 15 seconds we learn of his estranged family and Galban's attempt to block out his past.
Cullen's (Galban's partner) wife is facing not only the murder of her husband, but the persistent rumors that he was a corrupt cop.
Each person handles their trauma and loss differently, each with consequences.
This is the movie that after its over you have to just sit silently and think.",Exposed

Half in English,half Spanish, I only watched the whole thing because of Keanu Reeves, but I'm sorry he even had to act in that mess",Exposed
229,somethingmoveme,Better than the other reviews say,9,25 March 2017,"This movie had not-so-great reviews, but I had a couple hours and I loved Keanu Reeves as a teenager. So I gave it a chance.It was a bit slow in spots, but it gained momentum and revealed itself to be quite beautiful. I don't want to reveal anything, so I can't really say why it's so amazing.Just watch it. Stay until the end. I hope you'll give it a chance.",Exposed
