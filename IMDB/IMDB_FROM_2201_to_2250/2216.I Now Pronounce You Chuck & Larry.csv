0,MartinHafer,Meh...,6,14 June 2009,"WARNING: I don't know how this film eventually received the PG-13 rating, as there is quite a bit of sexual humor, adult language and male nudity. While for an adult audience this is okay, don't mistakenly think this is a kids movie.I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY is a decent time-passer but not a whole lot more. I think most of the problem is that the film makers could have either played the film straight (so to speak) and tried to make it profound or they could have simply played it for laughs. BUT, trying to do both at the same time (like this movie did) tended to lessen the social commentary as well as take away from what could have been a much funnier film. In other words, playing this middle ground, in hindsight, probably wasn't the best idea. As a result, when the film tried to be serious and make gay-positive assertions, it came off as forced and half-hearted.Considering that the film came out two years ago by the time I wrote this review and by now there are a bazillion reviews already, I won't summarize the film's plot. Instead, let's focus on what I liked. Sandler and James were both very good in the leads--I have no complaints there other than they tried way too hard to make Sandler some sort of stud. If he were NOT a movie star, there is no way he'd be able to get the girls he got in the film (especially pretty and very young Jessica Biel). Some of the supporting actors were very good. I liked Ving Rhames, Dan Aykroyd, the amazing dancing kid and that crazy dancing hobo. However, a few of the supporting actors sucked. Steve Buscemi's character was a caricature with no depth whatsoever as were all the non-gay positive characters--they were one-dimensional and were more like stereotypes than people. Also, how in the heck did Rob Schneider get away with such an awful and offensive performance?! Having him play a Japanese man (badly) hearkens to the days of Sidney Toler and Warner Oland (both Westerners) playing 'Charlie Chan'. I thought those days of having non-Asians play Asians (very broadly) were over--one of the positive aspects of political correctness. Now it is a little-known fact that Schneider's mother is a Filipino, but he still doesn't look the least bit Japanese and his character was MORE over the top than Peter Lorre's 'Mr. Moto'--and was a lot like Brando's impersonation of a Japanese man in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON or Mickey Rooney's in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (ugghh!!). With Schneider's Moe Howard-like wig, thick classes and buck teeth, he simply is a walking stereotype.Overall, it's a decent time-passer you can watch if you have Showtime. Otherwise, it's very easy to just skip this one.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
1,TheLittleSongbird,Actually manages to be worse than Little Nicky and You Don't Mess with the Zohan combined!,1,6 April 2011,"I do love comedy, and while I am not a fan of Adam Sandler I have liked some of his films and performances. Until yesterday, the time I finally sat down to watch I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry after avoiding it like the plague for four years, I made up my mind that either Little Nicky or You Don't Mess with the Zohan was Adam Sandler's worst movie. But after seeing this, I've changed my mind, this movie is worse than both.The main reason is that unlike the other two movies, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry often borders on offensive and stereotypical. Not just in the stupid dialogue and artificial concoction of homosexual gags, but also in Rob Schneider's offensive cameo as a Japanese wedding chapel owner. None of the characters are likable and are little more than clichés and bland stereotypes, and not helped by equally stereotypical performances. Sandler manages to be even less likable than he is in the aforementioned films, and shows no chemistry with Kevin James or Jessica Biel who are both bland. The only performance that comes close to funny for me was actually Ving Rhames, who is appropriately dignified and shows a talent for comedy.Also not helping is the film's uneven tone. One minute it tries to be sincere, next minute it is vulgar and stupid, I actually questioned what the aim of the film was. The premise was decent enough, along with a finale that manages to be sort of funny, but the execution is very flimsy and I was constantly predicting what was happening in the next scene. The direction is very unfocused for similar reasons with the story and its execution. The sincere parts are so uneven and the tone shifts so much without warning, that any good points that I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry tries to make are buried.All in all, a poor movie that is a serious contender for Sandler's nadir of his career. 1/10 Bethany Cox",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
2,bkoganbing,Domestic Partners,4,11 December 2009,"I'm hear to tell you that the whole premise of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry is all wrong. There would be no problem for Kevin James as a widower to have named his children as his pension beneficiaries, I speak as a retired New York State Civil Servant. Knowing that Adam Sandler and Kevin James would not have had to go through the whole charade does take the comedic edge of this film. But you go with what you got and the dynamic of the two men as New York City Firefighters and the fact those guys do live at the fire house, would not have entered the film if say Sandler had just been some unemployed guy looking to cash in on health insurance. The macho unease of the rest of the firefighters in the house would have been cut in half if only one gay man was there. As it turns out one actually was.So Adam Sandler and Kevin James to protect his survivor benefits declare themselves domestic partners in order to protect James's right to have survivor benefits. Presumably when the law straightens out, they will dissolve the partnership. But when city investigator Steve Buscemi gets on their case, Sandler and Young go so far as to get married in Canada to keep the charade going. In the meantime these two become gay community icons.A whole lot of gay stereotypes get exploited in the film and that I don't particularly mind. Political correctness can go over the line many times. And I certainly don't mind Adam Sandler decking some self righteous preacher during the film. What bothered me is two things. The idea that someone would fake domestic partner benefits is ridiculous considering the status that GLBT people are still held in too many places. Would you expose yourself to the ridicule that James and Sandler and James's children expose themselves to if you weren't gay? I sincerely doubt that. That part of the film, showing the imbecilic ideas some folks have is what is best about I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry.But when I was working fellow, I worked at New York State Crime Victims Board and was there when the World Trade Center was destroyed. My agency when Governor Pataki said that we would recognize both straight and gay domestic partner situations for benefits, paid several out that way to survivors. It was estimated that of the 3000 people who died on 9/11 about 200 to 300 were GLBT. Many of them had documentation from their employers who offered same to their employees and many also had registered at the New York City Clerk's office as domestic partners. Those domestic partner arrangements were accepted. I daresay some might have included NYC police and firefighters killed. Currently we are trying to get domestic partner benefits in my new adopted city of Buffalo. Safeguards would be put in place as they are in New York City, people would have to have joint bank accounts, bills in each name delivered to the same domicile, etc. It's not that easy to fake and not worth the consequences, except to those same sex people in a truly committed relationship.For that reason a film like I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry has to get a negative review, despite some funny moments.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
3,SnoopyStyle,Stupid and the premise is problematic,4,20 July 2014,"Chuck Levine (Adam Sandler) and Larry Valentine (Kevin James) are best friends and Brooklyn firefighters. Chuck is a womanizer. Larry is a widower still mourning his dead wife Paula. He is worried about his children's future. Because of convoluted bureaucratic problems, he needs to be married to change the beneficiary of his pension. When he saves Larry's life, he asks that they enter into a domestic partnership on paper only. Their plan runs into a problem when the department could be sending in an investigator. They consult with lawyer Alex McDonough (Jessica Biel) which could be a problem when Chuck falls for her. Chuck is forced to move in with Larry and his family. They must also keep the secret from everybody in case they also get charged for obstruction.This is really stupid and then they try to explain the premise. I'm not opposed to dumb humor. Many of my favorite comedies are ridiculously stupid. Kevin James has some funny moments but Adam Sandler's character angry side is problematic. The biggest problem with the beneficiary thing is that I don't really understand. Who knows if there is an easier way to get there but somebody should work really hard to find a way. They are somewhat funny pretending to be gay. Rob Schneider makes a horrible appearance as an Asian minister. This movie is at times funny, offensive, stupid, unbelievable, and unwatchable. The funny parts are too few and far between to save this movie.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
4,Prismark10,Cohabitees,4,30 July 2015,"Adam Sandler hit a winning formula for his movies which has garnered him a loyal fan base. He might be a proud Jew and Republican but he has Arabs, Muslims, Catholics, Hispanics, Blacks, Democrats (but probably not people from the Far East) who all seem to like his films where he plays the alpha male, one of the boys, sometimes with temperament issues, other times a little bit goofy who gets the girl and plenty of 1980s soundtracks.In I Pronounce You Chuck & Larry Kevin James is a widowed NYC Firefighter Larry worried about his kids future if he was to get killed in his job. Apparently he is unable to change his late wife's name to his kids names in his life insurance policy.In order to take advantage of a loophole he gets his fellow friend and firefighter Chuck (Adam Sandler) to post as gay partners so he can get his kids a pension. Chuck agrees as he owes him a huge favour for saving his life.The problem is that Chuck is a womaniser and their plan comes under suspicion so they hire a lawyer (Jessica Biel) who tells them to get married which they do and then face discrimination from people at work and others who disagree with gay marriage. Of course Chuck falls for the lawyer which results in more complications.The film was co-written by Alexander Payne who has two Oscars for best screenplays. I guess its because of his contribution the film is not a total dud as sometimes you feel like the duo's disbelieving boss played by Dan Aykroyd.Sandler is astute enough not to kiss Larry in the mouth and not to make an anti gay film. In fact despite poking fun at stereotypes and the bit about not being able to change the beneficiary being nonsense, the film actually makes a shrewd shout for gay equality and respect. The film is bit low brow in places and some of the humour is a bit hit and miss but Sandler manages to keep his fan base happy with his usual entourage of friends making cameo appearances but do we really need Rob Schneider doing a Mickey Rooney impression?",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
5,kosmasp,Happy,7,4 March 2021,"Anyone who knows or is into the history of words, knows that gay once meant happy. Of course some still like to use it that way, but that is really a minority. Because now it is equivalent with homosexual. I do not know when or why this got to that point.But back to this movie and me being a little bit surprised. Because yes this has the usual shenanigans (and suspsects aka actors) that any other ""Adam Sandler"" (TM) movie has .. but it seems to really root and go for the right reasons. Again while not always doing it the ""right"" way. Still many of the jokes can be seen under a better light due to its overall good intentions. At least that is how I perceive it ... that doesn't mean you won't feel offended by it. Depends on your experiences and your perceptions of things and how much you are willing to cut this some slack ... but as far as Sandler movies go, this is funny on the right side of .. funny for me (maybe I'm getting old? I am but I mean I'm starting to like them now? Something may be seriously wrong I reckon ... well it is what it is)",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
6,jboothmillard,I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,2,16 January 2011,"I had been told by many sources that this film was rubbish, and of course the critics had it the lowest rating possible with one star out of five, knowing a little about the concept I had to see what was up, from Razzie nominated director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, The Benchwarmers, Grown Ups). Basically FDNY fire fighters, bachelor Chuck Levine (Razzie nominated Adam Sandler) and widowed with two children Larry Valentine (Razzie nominated Kevin James) have been friends for ages, one day Larry is saved by his friend in a collapse. He thinks that death could come any day soon, so he wants to make sure that his children will be the primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy, but he can't do this, unless he is maybe married. Then he spots a newspaper article about domestic partnership involving a gay couple, so he asks Chuck if he would pretend to be his civil partner, and owing him he agrees, and also becomes his primary beneficiary. It is not long after the speculation as to whether they are gay or not means that investigators are hanging around their place, including snivelling Clint Fitzer (Steve Buscemi), trying to find out whether they are committing fraud. Chuck and Larry decide to get some help from beautiful lawyer Alex McDonough (Razzie nominated Jessica Biel), who Chuck tries to hide any feelings for and keep up the gay act, and with her suggestion they go to Las Vegas to get married. With it all legal they move in together and do everything they can to look genuinely gay, such as buy gay associated products, and go to gay benefit party, which Alex also attends, and Chuck defends the homosexual community from the protesters. They also have an ally in Fred G. Duncan (Ving Rhames) who may look rough, but he has actually gained the courage to come out of the closet, and with Larry's son being being effeminate son going against gay abuse, their opinions of them are changing. Chuck and Larry may have once been homophobic, but their attitudes are changing as they go through the charade, there may be a near spoiling kiss with Chuck and Alex, and he and Larry may have a fight, but they make up. Eventually the ""couple"" are taken to court to sort out whether or not they are truly gay or indeed carrying out fraud for financial gain, with sometimes harsh interrogation. In the end, they may be arrested thanks to Captain Tucker (Dan Aykroyd), but they are released and apparently agree to give photos for an AIDS research benefit calendar, Larry feels ready to move on from the memory of his dead wife, and Chuck can indeed be with Alex. Also starring Nicholas Turturro as Renaldo Pinera, Allen Covert as Steve, twice Razzie nominated Rob Schneider as Asian Minister and David Spade as Transvestite Groupie. I should first say that the soundtrack is typical gay stereotype songs, but they are good, including Pet Shop Boys' ""Always On My Mind"", ABBA's ""Dancing Queen"", Deee-Lite's ""Groove Is In The Heart"", Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"", Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman"", Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure"" and Queen's ""You're My Best Friend"". Anyway, the whole concept is morally and sensationally wrong, and the fact that they try to make it funny is a bit of a disgrace, it is full of stereotyping, the acting is low standard considering their other work, the laughs are minimal, I just wouldn't watch it again, a dreadful comedy. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for Sandler and either James or Biel and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
7,moonspinner55,Teeth-grindingly stupid to everyone but the target audience...,1,5 December 2008,"Straight pals pose as a gay couple to receive pension and benefits. To call an Adam Sandler comedy cheap or moronic is really throwing his fan-base a bone; they expect stupidity from Sandler and, once they get it, they praise his work and say those who don't laugh have no sense of humor. Playing a self-centered, womanizing fireman, smirking Sandler can't even dredge up enough acting enthusiasm to infuse this wan material with any vitality, but what exactly are we talking about here? Clay Aiken jokes and a jab at tap dancers. The small minds who concocted this thing haven't come up with anything new or fresh. It's recycled humor aimed at people who don't mind reruns. NO STARS from ****",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
8,tavm,"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is partly offensive, partly silly, and pretty funny",6,21 July 2007,"I have a gay friend who doesn't fit the stereotype in that he loves the WWE and usually watches crude comedies like this latest Adam Sandler comedy. Many critics have called this movie offensive because of many homophobic jokes that abound as well as the Asian stereotype that Sandler's friend Rob Schneider plays as a Canadian wedding preacher. Well, since I'm Asian-American and I know Schneider is half so, I admit I wasn't very amused by his portrayal but I also decided maybe Rob thought so and decided, ""What the hell!"" and went for it. But many of the homophobic jokes do work and is partly redeemed by some gay humor that seemed more silly than offensive and some were even hilarious. Besides Schneider, other former SNLers to appear include David Spade, Rachel Dratch, and original cast member Dan Aykroyd. All have some moments. Also appearing are Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames in a performance you won't believe (or maybe you will depending what you think he's capable of), and a couple of celebrities that recently came out, Lance Bass and Richard Chamberlain. And Keven James isn't bad either! Overall, based on bad reviews, I dreaded this movie but I laughed enough and enjoyed enough to at least recommend this to anyone who can laugh at almost anything. P.S. My gay friend absolutely loved this!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

No finer firefighters at their station. Chuck owes Larry for saving his life in a burning building. Larry is forced to call for that favor big time when bureaucratic red tape prevents him from naming his two kids as his life insurance beneficiaries. There is a loop hole though, a thing called ""domestic partnership"". A secret situation becomes a citywide issue, forcing the two friends into going the distance...a charade ""marriage"" and honeymoon. Crude sexual situations and a few genuine laughs. Redeeming is Jessica Biel's role as the couple's attorney.

10,studioAT,Woeful,1,12 September 2020,The likable Kevin James and the beautiful Jessica Biel get dragged through the mud in this woeful Adam Sandler comedy (apparently).Sandler plays smug a bit too well and this film is full of dull and full of laboured stereotypes.All involved need to pick their films more carefully.,I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
11,hitchcockthelegend,Crude rude and not up every one's street; ooh err sounds a bit rude.,7,5 May 2011,"I Know Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is directed by Dennis Dugan and written by Barry Fanaro. It stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Jessica Biel, Dan Aykroyd, Peter Dante, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi. Plot finds Kevin James' widowed fireman in need of a way to ensure his two children get benefits should he leave the mortal coil. There's a chance, he just has to pretend he's gay and marry his best pal and work colleague, Chuck Levine (Sandler). Not easy since Chuck is a renowned womaniser and not all that keen to keep up the pretense. With their gorgeous lawyer Alex McDonough ( Biel) stirring up passions in Chuck that he has to hide, and the fraud investigator (Buscemi) on their case, it will be a minor miracle if the lads can pull the bluff off. It was originally an R rated movie, the MPAA forcing Universal Pictures to edit the film down to a PG-13 standard. What is left is often crude, rude and apparently offensive to, well, everyone if you believe some critics of the film. I sense that many people outside of the target audience haven't grasped a key issue, namely that the film obviously has a big potent message about tolerance. Now ask yourself what sort of people would go and see an Adam Sandler film reeling off a number of gay innuendo jokes and set pieces? Tell me, where is it more likely to make its point than with the target audience for this film? I know, food for thought isn't it? It's hardly genius comedy, but James and Sandler make a great comedy double act. The jokes don't all work, but there are some genuinely laugh out loud moments if you are prepared to run with it in the name of getting the message come the last quarter. Biel is sexy and vibrant, while Buscemi does what he always tends to do, walk into a movie and leave a crazy and memorable little mark. Bonus here is Rhames, totally playing against type whilst also playing to a stereotype, again this is fun in context to the movie as a whole. We could do without Rob Schneider's (uncredited) Asian stereotype, because that one is an offensive misstep, while there's a big cop out during the big finale. A wasted chance to really seal the deal for equality and acceptance.It's easy to attack a film like this, venting spleen wholesale whilst looking like a champion for good taste in cinema. But I for one maintain that it's not only a funny film, but also a brave and relevant one as well. 6.5/10",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
12,jotix100,Domestic partnership,6,16 June 2009,"The mystery about Adam Sandler's appeal to the public will remain a puzzle we shall not even attempt to discuss. Mr. Sandler is today's incarnation of Jerry Lewis, playing it straight. We wonder if this actor is also adored in France? Who knows, they might even give him the Legion of Honor for his achievement in comedies such as this one! The film, directed by Dennis Dugan, based on the screenplay by Barry Fanaro, with the help of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, an excellent team of movie writers, who evidently were not as inspired as in some of their best contributions.Adam Sandler keeps turning up in successful comedies. He puts his money where he can also be the star, otherwise one wonders if they would ever had been made. It's a tribute to his power that he keeps appearing in comedies that appeal to a certain movie fan, as it is the case with this one, in which we are asked to go along with the silly premise that these two Brooklyn firemen can pull the wool over the people in charge by declaring they are involved in a gay relationship, and subsequent Canadian marriage, just to get Larry's children the protection they won't get otherwise.Kevin James has better luck with his character. The funniest moment in the comedy belong to Ving Rhames, who has come out of the closet recently, and he steps into the bathroom where the firemen are taking showers and two men had just dropped the soap. Hilarious moment, indeed. Jessica Biel does what she can with a character that doesn't ring true. Steve Buscemi and Dan Aykroid have some good moments.

He wants Chuck to take care of his two kids if he dies and (supposedly) he can only do it this way. They hire sexy lawyer Jessica Biel to defend them...and Chuck falls for her. All the predictable confrontations and stereotypes are trotted out...but not in an offensive way.This has gotten a lot of flack for not pushing the gay agenda a lot but come on! It's an Adam Sandler film! What do people expect? For the record, I'm gay. Yes, it doesn't push the envelope but what do people expect from a typical Hollywood film? Since it's a Sandler film there's the stupid gross-out gags and just unbelievable sexism (I hope Biel was well paid). Yeah, there are gay jokes but none are offensive. If anything this shows gay men to be strong, proud and deserving of a relationship. Also they have out Lance Bass and Richard Chamberlain in small roles. And it was REAL surprising seeing Ving Rhames playing gay--and doing it well! And Kevin James was excellent in his role.I may sound like I love the movie--but I don't. Sandler gets on my nerves and I hated him here. He can't act either. The gross out jokes and sexism were just disgusting here and there are more than a few bad jokes. My audience sat in dead silence when James and Sandler yell at each other about their failed relationship. It's supposed to be funny but it isn't. Also Rob Schneider's Japanese wedding chapel minister was more than a little offensive. For these things I can only give it an 8.

Stupid but somewhat funny take on the gay straight thing. Some people have found it offensive, I found it not very good as the film wants to be both a film calling for tolerance as well as making fun of the situation and everyone involved in it. To be fair it pokes fun at everyone, unfortunately the jokes it uses to send everyone up are stilted, obvious and so bad as to reveal their construction. You can see the comedic thru lines in pretty much every situation. It just doesn't work, granted this isn't as bad as the critics have made it out to be, but it still not a pretty sight.

Larry is widowed and learns that if he dies while firefighting his two children won't be covered so he talks Chuck into marrying him. Funny concept directed by Dennis Dugan whose films haven't exactly been inspiring. To his credit are such downers as The Benchwarmers, Saving Silverman and National Security. Adam Sandler and Kevin James have great comic chemistry that actually pays off here. Sandler reluctantly goes along with this scheme, while James tries to promote the whole idea.

Steve Buscemi is wasted as an insurance guy who is to show up at inconvenient times, and be a complete pain in the ass. Ving Rhames has a role that signifies the reality that homosexuals can be anyone and not necessarily the stereotypes we've been faced with.

I'm not surprised in the least that GLAD gave this film their seal of approval, as apart from some rather lame half-hearted soft jabs at homosexuals, the film does promote an extremely gay friendly message. Which in and of itself wouldn't be an entirely bad thing IF the actual jokes in this alleged comedy actually worked. Which they certainly don't often relying on jokes so stale that one could practically taste the mold on them. It's also one of those films that rely on a copious amount of uninspired cameos that feel shoehorned in the the story.

19,Sylviastel,Don't take it seriously and you'll enjoy it!!,7,3 September 2007,"Okay, this is not one of the best movies ever made nor was it the worst. But the premise of a sham gay marriage or domestic partnership to get health benefits and pension for his two children is done well with starring Kevin James as the widowed father and Adam Sandler as his best friend. He saved his life after all and he asked him for one favor which was to marry him in order to get benefits for his two children, Eric and Tori. Ironically, Eric would rather try out for a musical than little league. Of course, things go wrong because Sandler's character, Chuck Levine, falls head in heels over in love with their lawyer played by Jessica Biel. A great supporting cast includes Ving Rhames as a New York City fireman with a secret, Mary Pat Gleason as Teresa, Larry's housekeeper, Rachel Dratch as the benefits lady with her eyes on Larry, David Spade is there too, Richard Chamberlain as the commissioner, Steve Buscemi as the man who seeks the truth just for kicks. Anyway, they filmed in Brooklyn and New York City. Can't forget Rob Schneider as the Asian minister in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada? There are cameos by Lance Bass too but I didn't recognize him until I saw his name in the credits. Of course, the wonderful Dan Ackroyd plays the fire captain and Nick Turturro of NYPD Blue plays fellow fireman. I won't give away the ending. But I was touched that they mentioned the firefighters from the fire station who perished on September 11, 2001 in the credits. being a firefighter is not an easy job, the film doesn't take a serious turn but does show them doing jobs of rescuing and saving people in situations.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,8,28 September 2007,"Folks would have remembered Kevin James as the affable guy who needed help from Will Smith to hook up with girls in the romantic comedy Hitch. Which I thought was a little strange, because, and I'm not gay, James comes across in likable terms. In Chuck and Larry, he's the latter, again looking for help as his job as a firefighter puts him in considerable risks, and wants to ensure that his children's welfare is taken of in the unfortunate event that he goes.So who can a man turn to except to his best friend, Chuck (Adam Sandler), through a vowed favour to repay. In order go get around red tape, he has to marry somebody who will get his insurance dollars and use that to care for his children. And since same-sex domestic partnership is in, why not exploit it with none other than a buddy whom you have known for considerable time? But of course getting a ladies man to forever ditch his gallivanting ways is a tall order, and worse, having him to declare that he's gay is akin to asking him to lose all his limbs (yes, including that one).And to a test of their brotherly friendship and marital vows, temptation comes in the form of hot lawyer Alex (Jessica Biel, who looked smokin hot with those glasses), who proves to be too much to handle for the women-loving Chuck. Is it always that women will let down their guard with a gay guy who proves to be a best of both worlds confidante?Expect the usual gay and homophobic jokes to spew from the movie. However, Chuck and Larry somehow had a lot more heart in it than anyone would like to credit it for. While touching on certain gay issues does allow it to receive some punching bag treatment to bring on some laughs, I felt that it was not so much about gayness or a gay show, than it is about the friendship amongst the bestest of friends, you know, the one whom you can slug it out with when your views differ, but no sooner than the fists are put away, you can hit the nearest pub and down some pints together. While you may argue that it tackles the gay issue and opposition to them in a rather superficial manner, I thought it covered a lot of ground, and while they may be disguised under laughter, actually had very serious and contemporary issues brewing underneath it all. It may seem like a platform mouthpiece, but provides a very succinct coverage of the discrimination and prejudice these same-sex lovers face from society.The supporting cast here are recognizable faces, although reduced mostly to caricatures, like Dan Aykroyd, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi as a federal employee fraud investigator that you would just love to hate, especially with his disgustingly unhygienic coin pouch and irritating demeanour.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is a pretty even comedy with dramatic and touching moments. It's a romantic comedy with an added dimension, filled with an excellent soundtrack from acts like Wham, PM Dawn and even Cyndi Lauper. Oh, and you'll never look at, or use postal terms, ever the same again!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Cute and funny, but predictable and typical Sandler",5,8 November 2007,"When I saw the trailer to I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry this summer, I thought I was the only human on Earth who thought that it didn't look funny, but my best friend and her boyfriend saw it and she said that it was really funny. When it came onto rental, I figured I would just go ahead and see it. Just besides Reign Over Me, Sandler hasn't released any original or unique movies lately. So I watched I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry Tuesday night and while it was funny at times, it was typical Sandler: same cast from previous movies, him hitting people, funny beginning and middle, then sentimental message at the end, and predictable love story. I admit that it was funny at times, there are jokes that you find yourself laughing. The story was clever and made it look like the cast had a great time making the movie.Chuck and Larry are best friends and New York fire fighters; Chuck saves Larry from a bad fire that causes him to fall down from one of the floors and Chuck takes the floor that could have collapsed on him. Chuck survives but has a problem going on in his life, ever since his wife passed away, his pension plans for his kids are no good. But one thing could help him, if he re-marries, then his kids are set in case something happens to him. He asks Larry to make it look like a gay marriage, but to make sure that it isn't fake, the insurance company has people look over them, now they have to watch every step they take, especially with their hot looking lawyer. But they also learn the heartache of being accepted by the community.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is funny at times; but at some moments it seemed a bit hypocritical and predictable. Because the gay community accepts it so easily about Chuck and Larry being together after finding out the truth, which what I thought they did was very despicable. Acting wise, it's average, Jessica could use some work though, the scene where she undresses in front of Sandler and makes him touch her boobs, while it should be funny was actually more awkward. If you're looking for an average comedy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is right up your alley, but don't expect anything special.5/10",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
22,blanbrn,"A comedy of commercial success, but not a classic due to it's different theme type. Mostly carried and supported by the sexy Jessica Biel.",7,27 July 2007,"""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is an okay comedy that has it's funny and witty moments yet it's a little hard to believe this case probably wouldn't happen in real life. Two Brooklyn, NY firefighters named Chuck(Adam Sandler) and Larry(Kevin James) are good friends and watch each others back on the job, until one day Larry sees that he needs a domestic partner to receive a domestic partners benefit. So both decide to do a crazy thing while both are perfectly straight especially Chuck who's a lady man they play gay and decide to marry for benefits! This type of comedy is so odd the theme of playing gay seems crazy and the movie is a little out of place as it's hard to take the characters for real and believe the seriousness of their act, even though the performances are funny and good from both Sandler and James. Really the crudeness and ridicule the characters face distract the viewer in my opinion from the joy of the comedy. Yet it is heart touching and warming to see both central characters become good friends and have a better understanding of life as they goes thru this particular act. The best part and most supporting role in the movie is lawyer Alex(Jessica Biel) who represents the two when they are investigated by the state and agencies who suspected the evident scheme. Jessica's performance is very sexy and stunning her screen time was awesome her character was so flashy, intelligent, and warm anytime Jessica is on screen it just glows she was the supporting weight that carried this film. Overall an okay comedy that was themed a little different with strange crudeness proving people will go to any measures to obtain things while not taking it serious, yet audiences find many pictures like this appealing commercially yet this in my opinion is far from a classic.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
23,DKosty123,Walking A Comedy Tightrope To Laughs,9,28 December 2007,"Dennis Dugan who directed Adam Sadler in several other efforts is at it again here. It is interesting how this movie is constructed as it is more intelligent than many of its viewers judging by a lot of the negative comments I have read here on IMDb before seeing this film. What is becoming truly offensive to me is the hate Sadler Club that pans his movies without seeing the film. Looked at the hated it category here on this & try & figure out if any of these people have actually seen this movie?Adam Sadler & Kevin James star a couple of fireman with some unusual situations for each character. James is a fireman who lost his wife which is the opposite of what usually happens in real life. He is in such a stupor that he forgets to change the beneficiary of his fireman's insurance. After ignoring his mail for a year, he finally tries to do it and finds out the system is stacked against him. Then he finds out how to beat the system. This is a true story of the loophole created by the Domestic Partners laws currently on the books. Interestingly, it is the first film I have seen address the issue.Adam Sadler plays a real ladies man who can't seem to find Mrs. Right. His closest friend is James as the grew up together & joined the fire department together. All of a sudden James decides to beat the system, that his best friend, Mr. Wrong for a gay role, is the man to beat it with. Amazingly, Sadler agrees. The stretch from reality happens with these investigators who are trying to prove they are not a couple. There is no law on the books that says domestic partners have to really make physical love. There are normal couples who never do. These government investigators are the comic foil employed to hang the jokes on. The jokes really hit the mark often. Jessica Biel is great in the dual role of Sadler's Miss Right & the couples attorney. The only thing is her role at the trial sequence is a little thin. Dan Ackroyd is the Fire Dept Chief and the head of the too much information player. It is the best role I have seen from Ackroyd since Saturday Night Live.This film will not get its due, but comparing it to McLovin in that other film this summer, this film is much better. It has much more substance & I can understand how some of the hate Sadler club thought little of this movie. The humor is actually too intelligent for them to comprehend. They must be fans of BORAT or something.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

25,KineticSeoul,A film about Adam Sandler trying too hard to look manly,5,2 November 2009,"This is a film where Adam Sandler literally tries too hard to act manly and cool. This is a very stereotypical movie with a lot of gay jokes thrown in, and has some sexist images of women. Charles ""Chuck"" Levine (Sandler) and Lawrence ""Larry"" Valentine (James) are veteran FDNY fire fighters. And during there routine Chuck almost gets killed and Larry saves his life. Soon Larry realizes he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance due to the death of his wife. So in order to get his benefit he needs to get married. Larry asks Chuck to enter a pretend marriage with him after Larry read a article about domestic partnerships. Chuck declines at first, but is reminded of his debt to Larry so he agrees. The main highlight of this film is when Alex McDonough(Jessica Biel) is thrown into the mix, who play Chuck and Larry's lawyer. I however disliked Adam Sandler in this movie, he just tries way too hard to prove he isn't gay in this film to point it gets a bit annoying and he is like banging every girl that crosses his path in this one, yeah firemen get girls but c'mon. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit. I think it would have been awesome if Chuck and Larry eventually found out they are gay for each other cause Chuck is a sleazy gay character, but I doubt Adam Sandler would do it since he has such a high image of himself which I realized after I finished watching this movie. Basically the film is about Adam Sandler trying really hard to look manly, while there is a bunch of stereotypical gay jokes thrown in. Jessica Biel was really hot and attractive in this and is the main highlight of this film and finds herself in many situations in her underwear. Which is the main point, but her assets is a nice touch, so I can't complain.5.5/10",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
26,Buddy-51,Quite a bit better than advertised,7,25 November 2007,"In ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,"" Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two New York City fire fighters who pretend to be gay so that Larry's two kids can be raised by Chuck in the event of Larry's untimely death (Larry's wife has been dead for two years and he has not been able to bring himself to date another woman in all that time). The hitch is that to bring this about, the two of them will have to officially register as ""domestic partners."" Originally, they intend on keeping their ""relationship"" a secret, but when the government starts sending inspectors around to verify the validity of their claim, Chuck and Larry are left with the choice of admitting to the scam and going to jail or convincing everyone around them that they are indeed an actual couple.As a ""high concept"" comedy, ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is pretty much a contrived manufacture from the get-go, mixing equal parts humor and sentiment in an attempt to play to the broadest possible audience - which is probably the only way the filmmakers could reasonably have gone with material this dicey. Yet, while the movie traffics in any number of lame stereotypes (gay as well as ethnic), it also has some important things to say about equality and acceptance in an ever changing world. The script achieves about a 50/50 ration in its humor - about half the jokes are zingers while the other half are clunkers - but the movie's heart is definitely in the right place, so much so that you will forgive the filmmakers when the story turns all heavy-handed and preachy towards the end, in what is surely one of the least plausible courtroom scenes in motion picture history. As compensation, the movie actually places its characters in some pretty sticky moral dilemmas at times, the prime one being that, much as we may like and admire Chuck and Larry for all the social barriers they are tearing down, we still hear that little nagging voice in the back of our heads telling us that they are defrauding the public and breaking the law while doing so. Such moral ambiguity is actually a pretty rare commodity for a mainstream American comedy these days.Sandler and James imbue their roles with a great deal of charm and gusto, and they receive strong support from Dan Aykroyd, Jessica Biel, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi.""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" certainly isn't up to the level of ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad,"" its summer 2007 comedy contemporaries, but neither is it the cinematic disaster most of the critics have accused it of being. It's an uneven but largely likable romp that makes you feel good about the world when it's over.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

28,Robert_duder,For Once...the critics were dead on.,6,5 August 2007,"I haven't always liked Adam Sandler, it wasn't until post-Wedding Singer that I gained a respect for his films and comedy and his dramatic roles as well and now I like him and I had pretty high expectations that I Now Pronounce you Chuck and Larry would be a feel good, roll in the aisles comedy but I should have thought more about it and maybe actually (gulp) listened to the newspaper film critics. Chuck and Larry is not a feel good movie, in fact for the most part harsh critics were right stating that the film was anti-gay and sparking homophobia. Now I'm not one to be ranting and raving about how films should be politically correct but somehow they thought they would make a movie about two straight guys (one a man-whore), and one a family man who lost his wife pretending to be gay and make that film gay friendly. The jokes were most certain to be either over the top and dumb, or bland and boring and for the most part they went bland and boring, probably to be safe which is not Sandler's usual style. There is some good chemistry between the cast but there just isn't a comedic spark and the film runs longer the necessary, almost drags and then tries to pull off this lovely, heart felt ending that just doesn't work because the rest of the film is silly. I mean I can accept my share of plot holes but the entire reason they fabricate this 'domestic partnership' is DUMB!! It doesn't make any sense and if the entire base for the film doesn't make sense...that doesn't leave the rest of it much hope.Adam Sandler is lady loving, Chuck Levine who is a man's man and a fire fighter's fire fighter. They are trying to establish with Sandler's character what lengths he has gone to to give up his bachelor lifestyle to help his best friend but it doesn't really work out that way. He often comes across as mean and rude but he is the one who is supposed to discover acceptance and learning about being gay and yadda yadda yadda but it's never really believable. I mean Sandler always has a fun loving way about him and that doesn't change but the role is a million miles from what he is capable of. Kevin James is his best friend Larry Valentine who is single handedly raising his kinds following the death of his beloved wife. James is the typical kind hearted, teddy bear guy and that image doesn't change and him and Sandler do have good comedic timing and decent chemistry and I would love to see them pair up again in something a little more well written and worthy of their talent. James was far better in Hitch. Jessica Biel...well I admit I've never been a huge fan, I've never really seen her in anything mind blowing but she is apparently an 'IT' girl right now and they pair her up with Sandler. They make a better team when she thinks he's gay but Biel is kind of boring in the role. She doesn't really impress and simply uses her assets for eye candy when necessary but doesn't really get any of the funny lines or any of the really great moments. She's just there. Dan Aykroyd cameos as the fire chief and really does a great job. He has a small role but his truly outstanding comedy talent really does up the ante of the cast and they utilize him well and don't stick him in the background. Ving Rhames...well this guy actually does steal the show. If the entire film had been about him, it might have been hilarious. Rhames is downright hilarious as the closet homosexual, but mean looking, enormous new fire fighter who comes out when Chuck and Larry inspire him. This completely changes Rhames image and is so off beat for him, it's exactly what makes it so funny. He is terrific and steals the show in every scene. Also cameos in the movie include Steve Buscemi, Richard Chamberlain, Lance Bass, Jackie Sandler (Adam's real life wife), Judith Sandler (Sandler's mother), and although not credited ANYWHERE...IMDb or otherwise I am 99.9% sure Rob Schneider played the Canadian priest that marries them.Chuck and Larry is one of those films (usually comedies) where they manage to cram the really funny stuff into the trailers but sadly there isn't anything beyond that to really support it once you go and see it. I mean parts of it were mildly entertaining but you were never rolling in the aisles or even laughing out loud and the story was just silly and didn't make sense and even the way everything turned out seem very rushed and poorly put together. I'm not sure who is to blame because there is some sort of story there and potential but it doesn't pan out and this one is a wait to rent type of movie because it's not something that will really leave you smiling or give you a good feeling...it's just kinda okay and you don't want to leave a theater feeling 'kinda okay' or at least I don't. Hold off on this one for better things. 6/10",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
29,MLDinTN,a movie about gay rights isn't exactly what I call a main stream comedy,5,9 June 2008,"This isn't one of Adam Sandler's best comedies. He's back to playing the stupid guy. In this one, he plays a firefighter named Chuck whose a real ladies man. His good friend, Larry, a fellow firefighter, needs a benefactor since he didn't do anything to resolve the matter when his wife died years ago. So, he asks Chuck to pretend he's gay and marry him for insurance reasons. That right there is a really silly idea in itself. There lawyer, Alex, is a hottie played by Jessica Biel. Of course Chuck really likes Alex and she's the one to change his bed hopping ways. But first him and Larry must convenience the investigator they are gay and this isn't a scheme. Only problem is most of what is supposed to be funny really isn't with the gay jokes, etc... I just don't care for a comedy portraying gay rights like it's this great thing.Also, Jessica Biel is really in this for one scene only in which she strips to her undies and is on camera a while. That's probably more offensive than anything.David Spade does have a really good cameo in a bunny suit.FINAL VERDICT: Not one of Sandler's best. I don't recommend it.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
30,g-bodyl,Much Better Than I Thought!,8,7 December 2008,"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is a typical, funny movie starring Adam Sandler. I think critics don't like this movie because Adam Sandler has a kind of humor that most people don't have. Get used to it folks! The story is about two firemen who are ""gay"" because one fireman, Larry needed benefits to support his children. The story is mildly interesting. I am not a fan of gay jokes except when Adam Sandler is a main character and movies with plots like this. The acting overall is not too shabby. Believe it or not, Ving Rhames cracked me up the most as a fireman who seems as if he was going to go on a murder spree. Dan Aykroyd was hilarious as well as the rest of the cast that features Sandler, Kevin James, and Steve Buscemi. I really did not like Jessica Biel. She was very childish in this movie. Overall, this is a funny movie, not something to offend gay people. I rate this movie 8/10.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
31,Irishchatter,Hilarious and stupid!,5,9 June 2015,"Seriously, how many women has Adam Sanders character slept with? With a womanizer like him, I don't think any women should sleep with him, not even Jessica Biel's character lol! I know this was part of the movie but it's really promoting an unhealthy way to form a relationship to viewers. I suppose that's why Adam Sandler came with this to make us laugh at a serious matter.Dan Aykroyd was brilliant playing the captain in this. I'm glad he got picked to be on this since he is very well known. Including Steve Buscemi playing the creepy inspectors (aka Randall from Monsters Inc). He actually did in some part sounded like Randall. I say he loved rooting for rubbish to see if the guys were actually a gay couple. I wouldn't call this my favorite movie but it's watchable!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
32,The-Sarkologist,"Interesting Concept, Poorly Executed",4,11 October 2021,"Yep, this is a typical Adam Sandler movie. It gets panned by the critics, it gets ridiculously low scores on the review sites, but for some bizarre reason it cleans up at the box office. I suspect that the people that end up going and seeing his films probably don't write reviews on review sites, and definitely don't listen to the film critics. Mind you, while I might do the first, I certainly don't do the second because, well, I don't really pay much attention to the critics.So, the film is quite confronting in a lot of ways, especially with the struggles that the LGBT faced at the time the film was made, and even today. In fact it really does make you think about what they face, despite the fact that the marriage, if you want to call it that, was only done so that Larry could get around the bureaucratic nightmare that he faced when he was altering his will.Chuck and Larry are firefighters, and Larry's wife died but he hasn't got around to updating everything, namely because he really doesn't want to accept that she has gone. However, when he decides to do so he discovers that the bureaucracy is a nightmare, but he can get around it if he gets married. As such, he manages to convince his best mate, Chuck, to form a civil union with him so that he can sign off on the changes. The problem is that the pension fund decides to investigate the union, so they are forced to go further than they expected.Mind you, this film is pretty Sandleresque, and of course they have to paint Chuck as a manwhore at the beginning of the film to really make the idea of Chuck and Larry getting married as absurd as possible. Then again, like many of Sandler's movies, this is also about a manboy being forced to grow up, and of course in this case we have Chuck going from being a manwhore to being a responsible adult that actually wants to settle down. The other thing is the idea of two straight guys pretending to be homosexual, but also being put in situations that would tempt them, or at least tempt Chuck.The thing is that one of the reasons I didn't turn this film off (other than the fact that I rarely, if ever, turn a film off) is to see how they managed to get out of it. Honestly, I'm not sure they would have been able to get out of it as easy as they did, at least without making enemies of the entire gay community, as well as the entire anti-gay community. Yet, since we sort of become emotionally attached to the characters, we also see how they face the persecution that they do, and it is not just from the Christian fundamentalists, but from pretty much all quarters.Mind you, I felt that this film could have been done a lot differently without having to resort to the lies and the deceit that it does. Then again, you could also argue that it is basically Adam Sandler attempting to address a problem in our society in the only way that he really knows how to address it. The problem is that a lot of legitimate gay couples do face extra scrutiny due to people running scams like the one that is run in this film.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

It's the typical Sandler movie, though this one one obvious different for its reasons. Like most Sandler's films, there is at least one hot girl (in this case, Jessica Biel who plays a easily turned-on lawyer), and the immature sense of humour that Sandler and James make work.The plot deals with two New York firefighters, Chuck (Sandler) and Larry (James), who are two straight guy. However, with Larry's wife dead and his kids needing health care, Larry goes as far-out as to suggest that that fake a gay partnership in order to get free child benefits. In order to be taken seriously, Chuck and Larry team up with Alex (Biel), an intelligent lawyer who handles cases like this. That's pretty much the story. Basically they just experiment their life by actually being gay. The movie has jokes that intertwine with it, yet there is no part of the movie that I would call a ""laugh-riot.""

The jokes are homophobic but not offensive on any way. Also, some other jokes are references to actual events on American society.Ving Rhames steals the show in my opinion with an unconventional gay performance.

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A decent comedy clashes with social messages,5,14 February 2008,"""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" might seem to come with the childish moral of ""everyone is human and should be treated fairly no matter their lifestyle,"" but this Sandler- style comedy really twists that message.""Chuck and Larry"" a film about two firefighters that agree to a domestic partnership to help out Larry's (Kevin James) kids by allowing him to receive pension after the mother died. The plot is entertaining and farcical in a way, but there's no evading (unless you aren't that sensitive of a person) the feeling of guilt at laughing at some of these jokes. While the film constantly tries to push a message of acceptance, the humor really makes that feel less genuine.Like I said, the plot is everything a good Happy Madison film should be, but Sandler has never tackled a hot button issue like gay rights, let alone a real issue at all. Like Sandler's ""Click"" a film whose family themes and sheer strangeness are at total odds, two things--one bad and one good--are at odds in this film. ""Chuck and Larry"" is funny and clever, but the social commentary is at odds with the pervasive gay jokes.

They talk to a lawyer named Alex(Jessica Biel) who work with them. Chuck seemingly wanting to get out of the scheme before the cover is blown has very strong feelings for her. They spent more times with each other than he does with his long time pal Larry. The rainstorm scene is a classic. When Alex gets out of her rain-soaked clothes, Chuck gets to play with her breasts. Very titillating, and tempting. HAHA!It was also funny when he gets the ""bite"" part mixed. Those two may have cost the government credibility, but they made themselves heroes out of the gay community, also that firefighter with all those tattoos(Ving Rhames).

Well despite a somewhat biphobic fire chief who seems to think that being a womanizer means you can't possibly fall in love with a man, it's not INsensitive. It makes an effort to take the side of gays over the homophobics and even calls out Sandler's character's own insensitivity.Very sexual, infrequently arousing, naughty story of people exploiting a loophole in a flawed system and being thrown into a new world because of it. it's pretty low brow but its on the right side and I found the conclusions it drew made me feel pretty fuzzy inside.I love that little boy though they missed an opportunity not giving him a more colorful counterpart in his tomboy sister.All in all one of the better examples of its subgenre.

He tries to have pension beneficiaries for his children but the only way, he could have that for his kids. If he finds an wife or an husband. When Larry saves Chuck's life on the job. After that, since Chuck promises he will do anything for Larry. Now Larry wants Chuck to pretend to be his lover, so he could get the benefits. Since these two guys are not homosexuals at all.

The investigator, who loves to put Fruads in jail for a living. Chuck and Larry gets help from a lovely dedicate lawyer (Jessica Biel), who helps them. But she's no idea, they are not gay as well. While, Chuck is slowly falling in love with this woman. While the situation of Chuck and Larry pretending to be gay is more complicated and difficult than they expected to be.Directed by Dennis Dugan (The Beachwarmers, National Security, Saving Silverman) made an likable comedy with some big laughs and a game cast. This is probably Dugan's sharpest film to date so far and it is his most entertaining comedy since ""Happy Gilmore"". This comedy did had some controversy with this movie and it will probably offend some people. But it shouldn't. Probably the most offensive thing of this comedy is the Unbilled Cameo of Rob Schneider. Which he plays an Asian Minister. While Schneider is good for a few laughs, it probably the biggest insult for some movie audiences since Mickey Rooney playing Mr. Yunioshi since ""Breakfest at Tiffany's"". But anyway, this is a harmless silly comedy.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes two commentaries tracks. Commentary one is a fairly amusing audio track by director:Dugan and actors:Sandler & James. Commentary two is by the director. DVD also includes deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director and five featurettes. Since this comedy has a good cast, it's fairly fast paced and the usually tough Ving Rhames offers an change of pace role. But since it's written by the Oscar-winning screenwriters:Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. Who wrote films like ""About Schmidt"", ""Election"" and ""Sideways"". Since it's barely features their style of screen writing, it also written by Barry Fanaro (Men in Black 2, The Crew, Kingpin). There's a few flaws like the usual typical Sandler movie but it's still fairly funny comedy. Sandler's buddies appears in bit-parts and there's some amusing cameos as well. For Sandler's fans, this is not should be missed. It's worth a look. (*** ½/*****).",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
40,JoeKarlosi,I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry (2007) **1/2,6,5 August 2007,"Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two unlikely heterosexual firefighters who hatch a plan to get married, mainly so that widower James can have Sandler be his beneficiary for his children in case he dies on the job. They run into a heap of trouble when they are investigated and can face jail time by perpetrating a fraud. Now they're going to have to pretend to be gay partners. I had to see this for myself... first because I love Kevin James' television series THE KING OF QUEENS, second because sometimes Adam Sandler's comedy hits me right, and also because I was curious from hearing all the vocal objections to the gay stereotypes in this movie. Turns out that this was a moderately humorous comedy to me and, just as I suspected all along, it's done in good fun as it jabs at the gay lifestyle, yet also manages to show the level of intolerance and prejudices that homosexuals face on a regular basis. This was nothing like the horrendous and ""mean spirited"" comedy I'd heard so much about. Of course, it's not exactly ""PC"" for these times, but the stereotypical gags here are no worse than WHITE CHICKS (stereotyping blonde girls), SHALLOW HAL (ripping on fat women), THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (needling middle aged ""geeks""), or any other such types of movies.

The look on Sandler's unimpressed face is exactly how I feel too when I see he has made yet another bad film.... again Sandler plays a completely reprehensible boor. The storyline comes from an Australian comedy called STRANGE BEDFELLOWS starring Paul Hogan and Michael Caton (look it up) and continues the long line of Australian films that are remade into lame American multiplex pictures that dilute the original and get poured into shopping malls there nationwide: MAD MAX2 became WATERWORLD; then PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT became TO WONG FOO THANKS FOR EVERYTHING JULIE NEWMAR, note TWO HANDS became KNOCKAROUND GUYS and now this rubbish. In the Oz version both guys were charming and actually funny... but Sandler's vicious streak persona mangles that into humiliation humor as usual. Maybe one day some producer will actually get him to play Phil Silvers in a biopic of that comedian's life... or a remake-remake of SGT BILKO. That could be the only improvement that I could suggest... otherwise, into the dumpster with this Sandler pic too.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
42,TOMNEL,Why does Adam Sandler make these movies?,1,14 August 2007,"Though they make money, Sandler's fish out of water comedies never fully worked in the past, and this one doesn't work at all! I went in with an open mind, but once I got ten minutes in, I knew I would hate this. In this stupid movie, Larry (Kevin James) wants to gay marry Chuck (Sandler) so he knows his kids will be taken care of. Of course they go through all sorts of wacky situations to make them seem gay, and bad humor ensues. One reason I may have hated this more than other Sandler films is the characters. I liked Larry Valentine and if Sandler decides to make more buddy comedies he should use Mr. James. Chuck on the other hand is an awful character. He is supposed to be comically bad for laughs, but he is such a bad person that you wonder why anyone is friends with this jerk. Every bit of humor in this was brainless including a scene where Chuck finds a marijuana cigarette has started a fire, and being a professional fireman, he shoots the owner of it in the face with a fire extinguisher and everyone, including the fire captain (Dan Aykroyd) laughs. One scene Chuck and Larry save a fat man from his fiery grave and instead of leaving the house or trying to put out the fire, they laugh that the fat man farted in the burning house. There's many more problems I have with everything but I'll just shorten it to, this was a really bad movie.My rating: BOMB!/****. 105 mins. PG-13 for language, crude humor, sexual humor.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
43,Enchorde,Funny clichés,6,10 February 2009,"Recap: Widower Chuck Valentine needs to have his children as his prime beneficiaries in his pension. However the time to name them as such has long passed and now only a change in his marital status might help him. So he convinces best friend Larry to act as his gay registered partner. But soon their relationship is under investigation as the City suspects their marriage to be a scam.Comments: As most comedies, especially romantic ones, this is just full of clichés. Except for them being two guys in the relationship, this is just like many other comedies. Nothing new. At times it becomes pretty tiresome to be one joke ahead of the movie.However, a few scenes, a few jokes are just stellar (for example when Larry calls the telephone service of his Pension Fund). They're like bright gems in this well known cliché jungle. And they are what make this movie quite fun at times.Kevin James and Adam Sandler do well both of them, but it is the supporting actors/characters that steal the day. Ving Rhames is just perfect in his role, Jessica Biel underrated (interestingly enough the movie show her off, a lot, especially considering it is about two guys...). Veterans Dan Aykroyd and Steve Buscemi do very well too, but it was a little odd to see Buscemi as the bad guy. Some nice cameos to watch out for too (Spade is a personal favorite :) ) Works well for some laughs one evening, but don't expect a masterpiece.6/10",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
44,Kamurai25,"Resolving the ""will they, won't they"" between Keving James and Adam Sandler",6,7 July 2020,"Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend, particularly for Happy Madison fans.I feel, that for Happy Madison, this is a fairly progressive movie. If nothing else, they acknowledge, in this movie, stupid things they've done in other movies, and if nothing else the ultimate message of less hate and more inclusivity is a positive thing.I just have no idea if this group of yahoos, pretending to be relatively good people doing an awful thing, is the best spokesmen group, and I'm just very aware of that. That aside, there is good humor, a good balancing to the story lines, and some wretched humor concerning sexuality. While some of it is in the service of the greater message, others are sex shaming messages: either the joke is ""she wouldn't bang him"" or ""he wouldn't bang her"" so it causes a mixed message of what sex we should accept.This is the sort of problem with comedy companies trying to do something more serious, making it comedic to make the serious thing more palatable becomes some weird compromise instead of a great movie. I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's difficult, and this just didn't reach that bar.If you're okay not to take the movie seriously, or not be offended, then this can be a pretty entertaining movie: just try not to learn anything.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
45,eric262003,Accept For What It Is,6,18 October 2020,"I made the efforts to make it through. Being that it's an Adam Sandler movie and the target audience that the film cater through is towards the male teens and young adults who still haven't evolved in their intellectual level. Sure I found his earlier material like ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"" quite entertaining but then he has failed to meet the same expectations from his later films. Though I must say, ""Click"" was quite funny. Coming into ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"", I has my hopes low, but I guess I gave it a shot knowing fully well what I was getting myself into.Adam Sandler and co-star Kevin James are Chuck Levine and Larry Valentine firefighters who work for the FDNY and are heterosexuals. Larry's wife passed away and is left raising his two children while Chuck is single and has continual sex with other women. Larry can't be granted pension for his kids unless he gets married, so he asks a reluctant but willing Chuck to be his faux husband and to watch over his kids if ever he should ever die on duty. Things take a slight hiccup when their legitimacy starts to come into question. The hire an attorney named Alex McDonough (Jessica Biel) who happens to be quite beautiful. Chuck likes her not for her intelligence of dedication, but for her looks though he tries to conceal it every way that he can. The duo then travel to Canada and are legally wed. This leads to investigator Clinton Fitzer (Steve Buscemi) to watch their every step along the way. Chuck shacks up with Larry and the kids and before long, the guys at the fire department start mocking at them with homophobic slurs and close-by neighbours.Once again Sandler is at it again playing his trademark man-child character spewing off homophobic, sexist and playground humour at every chance he gets. Though at times his lines are funny, then there are times when he could be kind of a jerk. The sad part is that Sandler has done this same type of role, and can perform this kind of act sleepwalking and is doing it to cater to his fanbase. Kevin James on the other hand is a more kind-spirited, lovable character who plays the straight act to this comedy duo. Just like Sandler, James seems to play this role time and time again with nothing new to offer.Though Biel may be eye-candy to the male demographics especially to Sandler, she proves that she's more than just window dressing. Her comedic timing is spot on and her character is intelligent, sweet and dedicated in her work ethic. It's a shame that Dan Aykroyd has little to do except churn in one-liners. Ving Rhames does exceptionally well making parody to the roles he's played in the past. As for Buscemi, his creepy character role though familiar, is still highly entertaining.Written by Alexander Payne, Barry Fanaro and Jim Taylor, the script is immature, incoherent and awkward. With the reputation they have as veteran writers you would think they could've wrote something with a little more sophistication to it. Instead they just lower their standards to used jokes and an archaic use of gags that were templates back in the 1980's. Taken from a guilty pleasure aspect I'll give credit that Sandler and James had great chemistry and are great as a comedic duo.Under the direction is Dennis Dugan who has worked with Sandler before, decides to take a more sophomoric route this time. Though it may not be entire offensive as everybody thinks, the direction adds little in terms of originality. The whole don't drop the soap in the male showers troupe can be quite tiring. And though lampooning the stereotypes of all walks in life can be funny, it becomes more out there and less nuanced. We get tired of the portrayals of gays being effeminate and flamboyant, or women being just eye-candy or that straight dudes are fumbling morons. but if these jokes carry on in its entirety, it becomes one-note and irritating. Sure every so often they soften the blows with the whole gay people should never be judged for who they are, but then it only gets mentioned here and there and is reduced to just an afterthought. The idea is to find gross out intentions of two guys kissing is centered around to make the teenage audience laugh, but older people will find shameful that they try to take this male bonding as a joke when really it could be a sign of gay acceptance.Aside from immature, sexist and homophobic this movie is, racism also joins the Party of Discrimination too. The racism stems from the badly stereotyped performance from an uncredited Rob Schneider as an Japanese-Canadian minister. Sure Schneider has some Asian extraction in him, there was no need to make his accent that strong. Most Asian Canadians talk with North American accents. It's stuff like that is what annoyed me the most.The movie doesn't go for any dares, most of the performers especially the leads are playing typecast, the jokes have been done to death, and the sensitive moments are in the background being that it is an Adam Sandler movie. Sure it might not be serious as in ""Brokeback Mountain"", I still would've been satisfied if in the end if either Chuck or Larry really was gay. Instead they decided to leave out the moral premise and chose the path of playground humour. At best the film is just a guilty pleasure.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

Dan Aykroyd is their principled fire chief, Steve Buscemi is some kind of unfunny government snipe, and spankin' Jennifer Biel provides the much-needed estrogen in this movie really targeted at breeders.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
48,KUAlum26,The Sandler/James Players present....,5,17 July 2008,"Widowed firefighter Larry Valentine(Kevin JAmes,for whom I still want to keep calling Doug)needs to get benefits to help him and his two small,adorable and not-so-ordinary kids. He appeals to his best bud and firefighter comrade Chuck Levin(Adam Sandler,who produced this film and he's NOT shy about showing it,I'll explain later),who's a chick magnet almost preternaturally,to help him out to con the state and city into giving them married couple benefits by pretending to be his gay lover/husband.I probably didn't have to tell all of that,since the ads for this film last summer pretty much spelled it out and,in fact,the title itself probably also gives it away. BUt I did,because I pose this question to you dear reader: how many people saw these promos and wondered 'Hm,I wonder how they'll pull this off?' If you did,you'll probably genuinely pleased with this film. For the rest of us,well...speaking for myself,while I found stuff to laugh at here,it still was glaringly weak.From the lazy,meant-to-be-poking-fun-at-homophobes humor that unintentionally becomes just what it set out to NOT be(to varying degrees) to the way-to-predictable favoritism casting of Sandler's movies(Rob Schneider,Allen Covert,David Spade,his wife Jackie,Blake Clark and GAry VAlentine,JAmes' brother, all get parts here) and the fact that Jessica Biel is as gorgeous as she is completely unconvincing as the advocate lawyer they turn to for help who happens to be falling for Chuck(of course!),this film is pretty much an exercise in cheap laughs that is propelled by what's probably a good heart(or hearts). Director Dennis Dugan must LOVE everything that SAndler and company ""threw at the wall and saw if it stuck"" because it seems like there's few gags that are turned away from here for effect. As I said before,this show made me laugh some,and some fantastic supporting roles by Dan Aykroyd(As the duo's chief,who's not buying the ruse)and Ving Rhames(as the brooding,potentially violent co-worker with a secret. I wonder what that'll be?)made this at least passable. Still,this is,despite any controversy that it's stirred up(And it stirred up some!),basically another Sandler-inspired comedy,well-intentioned and yet vulgar,that seems to be made with little fore or afterthought. He and JAmes can do better work,and this could've been a better movie,but that didn't seem of major a concern,and it shows.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

50,jaredmobarak,You can come out of the down lowI Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,5,1 September 2008,"I don't like the fact that I will go into films with a preconception about how I may end up enjoying them. Adam Sandler's vehicle I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry was one of these. Never really seeking it out due to the horrible track record his comedies have had of late, I wasn't exactly psyched to sit down and watch. At the start I was pretty much in agreement with where my head was going in, the fake Brooklyn accents, the horrible bluescreen of NYC behind the racing fire truck (although I blame the HD for that), and the bland jokes made up of a mix between obvious and uninspired definitely didn't help. However, once we get into the true plot lineKevin James' Larry Valentine attempting to get his pension moved to his kids after failing to do so in the year since his wife's deaththings start picking up, both story-wise and laugh-wise. By no means a great film, there is some charm hidden within that crops up enough to make it just the right amount of enjoyable making me feel that I didn't completely waste two hours of my life.We need a contrived instance to set up our asinine plot device and it comes in the form of James saving Sandler's Chuck from plummeting to his death during a secondary search after a fire. Chuck, in the hospital, of course says how he will do anything Larry needs to make up for the deed. Well, this ladies man lotharioseducing a frigid nurse into having some fun with he and five Hooters girlswas not prepared for the bombshell laid on him to get married as domestic partners, moving the pension so he could give it to the children. Like the sentimental drivel that crops up at the end, this is NYC and these guys are firefighters. It's a brotherhood and they stick together as a family. If one guy goes down, the whole lot of them does. Well, that is after they accept the fact their two buddies are gayI mean these are manly-man men, they won't turn to acceptance too fast.The dynamic works as Sandler and James play up the whole ""relationship"" thing by creating marital humor doubling for friendship. They sleep in the same bed; they bicker about how they faked the laughter when the other told a joke and how they never hang out anymore. While that is all well and good, I was happy to see that the two don't share as much screen time as I initially thought. Instead we get wonderful moments with periphery characters. James has a continual spat with Steve Buscemi's insurance pawn looking to catch them in fraud as well as with the mailman who wants to get in on the ""gay"" action; Sandler has possibly the best relationship of the film with Jessica Biel, the lawyer they've hired to make sure they are seen as a legitimate couple. Sure the whole ""girls night out"" and friendship bracelet making is a tad much, but it worked for me. Here is a guy that finally finds a woman he wants to be better for and a girl who has found her perfect man in a gay married firefighter. It's a pairing ripe with clichés yet I bought into it and enjoyed seeing how it all played out to the moment of revelation that will of course crop up at the end.The story tries its hardest to be politically relevant, doing its best to shed light on bigotry and peace for all kinds of people. There are of course instances of flamboyancy to counter those of normalcy, showing that the true homosexuals may not be afraid to show off their colors, but they still get hurt from all the bashing. It's a fine line that seems balanced enough to be unobtrusive, although I'm sure there are people who were offended just like there are for any movie with a hot-button topic.Where Chuck and Larry succeedsas with most Sandler filmsis with the supporting cast. Rob Schneider shows once more that he can be funny when he is not the star of a movie. His Asian minister is a real good laugh, offensive yes, but doesn't that always get coupled with funny? The usual crew of friends pops up throughout, either as fellow firemen or, in Allen Covert's case, a fellow parent at James' kid's school. The real home-run hitter, though, is Ving Rhames. I should have known the arc his role would take, but the filmmakers do a nice enough job distracting us from him for most of the film until reintroduced towards the end. Starting as the big, strong, silent type no one wants to mess with, Rhames becomes the funniest part of the film when he finally speaks. There are also some funny scenes, even one taking place in the fire hall shower with soap being dropped. The idea itself is completely uninspired, but the way it's handled made it work just enough to be fresh and funny despite its stereotype.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

It's hardly original, but in the hands of a master of bad-taste comedy it might have been very funny. Unfortunately, director Dennis Dugan ain't no Mel Brooks--and Adam Sandler sure ain't no Cleavon Little.Throughout the film Sandler is presented as a mighty stud and a chick super magnet--but given that Sandler is about as sexy as Wally Cox this is even more improbable than the plot itself. We are also very obviously supposed to like him--but given that he spends the film finding ways to be obnoxious to every one who crosses his path it isn't possible to do so. I could overlook this if the film was actually funny, but it isn't: there's no wit, no cleverness, no originality, and most damning of all no heart. We feel nothing for these people except, perhaps, a sense of gratitude that we aren't like them.When all is said and done, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY is simply a parade of unoriginal insults with a few minutes of ""aw, shucks, folks! We didn't really mean to offend anybody"" tacked on at the end. Nothing is more excruciating than an unfunny comedy except a dull unfunny comedy, and this is all of that with a Hallmark card thrown in for good measure.The DVD includes several bonuses, including a couple of audio tracks with Sandler, the director, and so on--but I can't comment on them because I couldn't be bothered to learn more about a movie that was so tiresome in the first place. If you're in the mood for bad-taste comedy, pick up a copy of PORKY'S, American PIE, or better yet the classic BLAZING SADDLES instead. Not only are they actually funny, they also have heart.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
53,jon.h.ochiai,Funny and Insightful Chuck and Larry,9,28 July 2007,"Thanks to Isaiah Washington of TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"", we have yet another notorious f word. After punctuating his point to a bigoted protester screaming that f word, the very heterosexual Chuck (Adam Sandler) says, ""The accepted vernacular is gay!"" Sandler's Chuck is in fact posing gay so that his straight buddy Larry (Kevin James) has a faux domestic partner; thus, providing a beneficiary for his assets in case of his demise. Larry is a widower with two young kids: Eric (Cole Morgen) and Tori (Shelby Adamowsky). Both Chuck and Larry are firemen, who risk their lives on a regular basis. Director Dennis Dugan's ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is outrageously funny, and perhaps strangely and unintentionally insightful about loyalty and being true to one's self. In fact Ving Rhames's tough guy character Duncan ""outs"" himself quoting Shakespeare, ""To thine own self be true."" Although the beginning of ""Chuck and Larry"" is mostly crude and stupid funny, it eventually morphs into a cautionary parable of prejudice. Granted some of the points are lame and predictable. However, I presume largely due to Alexander Payne (who wrote ""Sideways""), along with co-writers Barry Fanaro, Jim Taylor, and Lew Gallow, ""Chuck and Larry"" has a weird noble resonance. This works because Sandler and James as Chuck and Larry are such lovable lugs having amazing chemistry and are hysterical together.Also I don't know if this was truly intentional on the writers' part, the movie comments on the relationship of men and women. This is akin to ""Tootsie"" where a guy pretending not to be a guy can really be with womensans the bullsh*t. Jessica Biel, who plays gay activist attorney Alex McDonough, is stereotypical, yet in a uncompromising way. Chuck and Larry hire Alex as their attorney when their domestic partnership becomes suspect. Alex has a gay younger brother Kevin (funny Nick Swardson), and passionately defends his right for self expression as well as the entire gay and lesbian community. However, Alex is alone, just broken up with boyfriend. So she finds solace and safety in spending a ""girl's day"" with gay Chuck (that would be posing gay). She finds that she can just be herself with Chuck. She even says, ""Why are all the good men either married or gay?"" Likewise, Sandler's Chuck really sees Alex, because he lapses into not being straight. Chuck acknowledges Alex saying something very few straight guys would say, ""You are gorgeous, smart, and funny"" What follows is predictable. However, Director Dugan refreshingly punctuates that integrity, courage, and compassion have nothing to do with gay or straight. Sure there are recurring gay jokes about whether Chuck is the ""chick"" of the couple, dropped bars of soap in the shower, Larry's son Eric, who dreams of being a Broadway star. ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is hilarious, and ultimately has its heart in the right place.Anyone who has seen the trailers for the movie knows that Jessica Biel is stunningly beautifulshe is hot. She is also radiant and a talented straight man. The scene with her letting Larry feel her up, because she thinks he's gay is both hot and hysterical. As Alex, Biel has such an appealing charm and vulnerability. I really went to see the ""Chuck and Larry"" for Bielthat's my story. Adam Sandler masterfully balances his goofy charm and hyperbole. The scene with him and the Asian Hooter's Girls is classic. Also Sandler thankfully plays it smart, not dumbed up. He is just very comfortable and at ease. Kevin James is so great as Sandler's partner in crime or gay. James as Larry evokes such a believable authenticity as a guy wanting to do the right thing, ending up above his head. James is your every guy's guy, very funny, and never over done. Ving Rhames has perhaps a legendary shower scene that had me laughing on the floor. Rob Schneider has an uncredited role as the lovable Las Vegas Japanese ministerhe is hysterical too. Dan Akroyd is solid and funny as Captain Tucker. ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" also lends itself credibility in casting ""outed"" Richard Chamberlain and Lance Bass (formerly of N'Sync). With Dugan at the helm ""Chuck and Larry"" is completely funny, predictably sentimental, yet never takes itself seriously. However, Dugan reminds us all that virtue and character have nothing to do with gay or straight. Thank you, Dennis. See ""I Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"".",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

57,Isaac5855,A Hilarious Comedy Unconcerned with Political Correctness,7,18 March 2008,"Adam Sandler and Kevin James (THE KING OF QUEENS) provide big laughs in I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY, an uproariously funny comedy that, though not terribly concerned with being politically correct, will make you laugh in spite of yourself. Sandler is Chuck and James play Larry, best friends and firemen who have seen each other through everything, including the death of Larry's wife. After a recent brush with death in a bad fire, Larry becomes concerned that his current insurance benefits will not properly provide for his children in the event of his death and learns that the only way he can properly provide for his children is to enter into a domestic partnership with Chuck, where they would pretend to be gay lovers and actually marry. Laying aside the fact that I can't imagine two heterosexual men ever doing this in real life, it does lay the groundwork for one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years. Gay stereotypes are perpetuated at every turn but there is nothing mean-spirited about it making the incredible premise plausible. Also thrown into the mix are Larry's son, whose interests seem to be limited to tap dancing, baking, and auditioning for the school musical, and a pretty attorney (Jessica Biel) who catches Chuck's eye but unfortunately he has to conceal his feelings about her. Mention should also be made of a hilarious supporting turn from Ving Rhames as a fellow firefighter who is inspired to come out of the closet, after being inspired by Chuck and Larry's relationship. Primarily, it is the inspired comic teaming of Adam Sandler and Kevin James that makes this one work.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
58,bopdog,"Engrossing, but NOT a gross-out. Splendid entertainment, very funny!!!",9,21 July 2007,"Maybe you'd have to be an Adam Sandler fan to enjoy this one. I AM a fan, and I liked it. It was funny--- hilarious in spots. The dood posse was likable and chummy. Matey. The chicks were hot. Jessica Biels, a new face for me, is an appealing woman, and her turn as the earnest human rights attorney was very spot-on and apt.It was nice to see Sandler's regular crew with him--- those 4 or 5 guys who are in EVERY Adam Sandler movie. I forget all their names, but Allen Covert, Blake Clark, and Peter Dante are the few names I recall. No matter what the movie, and what the roles call for, those guys always fit in seamlessly. Obviously, they are talented actors--- one wonders why they aren't seen more, in other movies? Maybe they like the relative anonymity of merely appearing every 2 or 3 years with their pal Sandler?Also, there was nothing here, gay-wise, and fish-out-of-water-wise, that hadn't been covered elsewhere--- ""In and Out,"" ""The Closet"" (""Le Placard""), etc. But that was fine with me--- the point wasn't to go to this movie for information, like some social studies lesson, but rather to be entertained, and enjoy myself laughing. Sandler and the entire cast had such a strong presence and personalities jumping off the screen, I was engrossed, without being grossed out. I was entertained thoroughly! The gay thing was played pretty well. I would presume the assumption of the makers of this movie is that straight males would wince and cringe as the gay-o-meter crept up the scale--- will they actually kiss? Will there be tongue? etc. But thankfully, that card was not overplayed. It was used just enough to get some good laughs, and just enough to show us that the movie was aware of its content, and the audience.There was a little bit of overly-earnest PC messaging going on here, about the gay thing. but I guess that's alright. Again, it wasn't taken too far.Overall, I found the set-ups, that is, what passed for ""drama"" and more or less straight comedy, to be appealing. The weird parts were funny, too, and not nauseating--- all, I believe, within the scope intended by the script writers, director, and producer (Sandler himself). Great fun!!!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

Unfortunately, dear readers, that's how I spent the majority of my time with Dugan's sloppy topical comedy. An occasional chuckle emitted from my lips but, more often than not, it was the result of sheer disbelief that a film could be so offensive yet so tame, so eager to scramble for meaning yet so anxious to wallow in the mud of its least common denominator gags, so determined to make a clear-cut statement yet so willing to cut that statement off at the knees at every turn. Endless clichés and dated stereotypes abound -- homophobic, homosexual, heterosexual, transsexual, racial, sexist... you name it -- and the groan-inducing characters have apparently been yanked straight out of the '80s. Am I really to believe New Yorkers, no matter their occupation, are this unfamiliar with alternate lifestyles? Even if so, am I really to believe these decade-depressed holdovers would lie, cheat, and steal with ease, but have trouble planting a simple kiss? By the time misguided rape jokes made their way into the proceedings, I began wondering if Dugan had any understanding of the film he actually wanted to make Another Great Adam Sandler Film!!!

Not very far,5,23 June 2008,"The comedy team of Adam Sandler and Kevin James had loads of potential and I can see why they went for it but it doesn't really get any better than average. Yes, there are every single gay joke you can imagine and what else would you expect. After all, the movie has the Sandler mark all over it. Do you think he was gonna be subtle? The thing that goes deadly wrong is that Sandler repeats himself again and again. The courtroom scene at the end is like watching the end of every possible Sandler comedy you can possibly imagine. It's so sweet and wonderful and everything is tied up all so nice. The female lead, Jessica Biel is won over far too easy yet again. Remember, the Yankee Stadium scene in Anger Management? Apart from that, there are a few good moments, especially when Kevin James is on screen. He doesn't get to overshadow Sandler and he was never meant to and he is on the receiving end of some very old comedy schtick where he gets slapped all the time, thus to prevent him from ever getting lip locked by Sandler.So what is good about it. The jokes are funny the first time you hear them and you do laugh but you think afterwards that it wasn't really that original.

63,ClaytonDavis,"I Now Pronounce You, Funny & Tender",6,6 October 2007,"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry written by Academy Award winning writers Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor along with Barry Fanaro, is one of the smartest, and tender comedies of the year. The film stars comedy superstars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as two NYC firefighters, Chuck Levine and Larry Valentine who pretend to be a gay couple in order to get domestic partnership benefits for Larry's children who has recently lost their mother. When the partnership is questioned by City Official Clinton Fitzer played by another comedic icon, Steve Buscemi, they turn to the beautiful intelligent lawyer, Alex played by the sexy Jessica Biel.The film brings forth some laughs but all in all the film soars on dramatic level which I believe Payne and Taylor weren't exactly aiming for. Sandler still struggles as a dramatic actor and finds it hard to find his inner characters without bringing himself out. We are still waiting for him to return to form as he did in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love. James however, is quite an actor who shows the most vulnerable parts of Larry without going over the top. We enjoy Larry's company and look forward to his story unraveling. Kevin James will have an easier transition into more affluent and demanding roles as an actor than Sandler has.You also have your usual suspects in the Sandler films like the unrecognizable Rob Schnieder and you'll find some comfort in Dan Aykroyd who has been missed from the screen for some time and Ving Rhames who is always as funny as he is intimidating. But don't look for a revolutionary story to befall in front of you, it's a good watch, not a great one.The film drags on a bit and no stand outs that scream recognition.

Now the story may not have been in good taste, but it was well worth some huge laughs. Now my main problem is that I truthfully would like to see the old Adam Sandler back. I miss the Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison Sandler that would randomly act like a goof for 90 minutes. For some reason when you had Sandler doing random music numbers, making up ridiculous songs and overall being a goofy characters, you felt as if he lived up to your expectations.

But I cant help thinking it is offensive to many, and so cannot rate it because of that.And I don't know why Mr Sandler thinks he is irresistible to women, he should get a mirror and a personality transplant, because he looks like an old english sheepdog without the hair and sounds like a whining donkey, and not that funny, his comedy and ideas about how gay men behave is about the level of a 5 year old.A film should be inoffensive if it hopes to get positive reviews.

68,tastyhotdogs,Poor,4,15 February 2008,"""I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry"" is a movie about a lady (Jessica Biel) who finds herself in many situations in her underwear. I think that was the point of the movie. The other subplot was about two guys (Larry, played by the fat guy from ""King of Queens"" and Chuck, played by the guy in ""Little Nicky""), who are the best of friends who work together as fireman. Larry gets himself into some financial woes, and after hearing about new rights for gay couples, decides to ask Chuck to pretend to be his gay partner. Chuck, who is woman crazy, declines at first but then remembers he owes Chuck his life, so agrees. What they think will be a quick and easy case of pretending they are gay turns into the need to get married and trick even their family and friends into believing they've turned. This obviously throws up some hilarious circumstances, many of which aren't really that funny.Very ordinary. Some of the humour was pretty off and some stuff just too weird. I don't know if I can ever trust Adam Sandler or Kevin James again. Jessica Biel did her ""being taken seriously"" chances no good either.

69,nobbytatoes,stereotype hell,3,16 August 2007,"For this writer, the attraction of each Adam Sandler film becomes lower and lower. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry finally takes the cake, or breaks the tolerance; ironically when this films preaches about tolerance, to how lazy each film is and how far this film verges on insulting. In hind sight after viewing Chuck and Larry, there is an episode of South Park, which looked at gay marriages, also another episode on tolerance. As far yielding South Park has with its PC levels, the outcome is satire and social commentary gold. Screenwriters Alexander Payne, Barry Fanaro and Jim Taylor; looking at Payne and Taylor's previous films Sideways and About Schidt, something isn't right here. All three scrape the bottom of the barrel, digging up every cliché and stereotype to whip up a film more insulting than actually bringing awareness.All Characters are flat and one-dimensional. Larry the sensitive father looking out for his kids, while Chuck the womanising ladies man, who is far from the Playboy Man he thinks. Every element of Chuck and Larry is basic 101 film making. Chuck is so ugly at the start, but only to make his transformation more impacting, but is deft of any impact. Dennis Dugan has become the main director for any of these Sandler comedies, with uninspiring and flat directing; whenever a good moment arises to adds strength, Dugan take all the easy steps. His paint by colours in hand. Gay stereotypes come flying left and right, all presented as the weak wristed men, who need the strong heterosexual to shown them how to be a man. Squirm as Cindy Lauper's 'Girls just wanna have fun', on a ""girl"" shopping spree, or the oldest joke of dropping the soap. That joke ought to stay in the Naked Gun.Chuck and Larry, while presenting tolerance for the homosexual community, also brackets to simple respect for all people. Yet no tolerance is left for any audience member, or the groups and minorities they leave little for. Regression and backward steps are taken, instead of strengthening the rights for any group attacked by Conservatives. A staple of the Sandler's company Happy Madison is schmaltz life lessons that churn the stomach than warm the heart. Remember Click? Actually lets not remember. The final note that everything will work out hinges on some un-noted preconception. No burning effigies, but crowned heroes.The real surprise here is Jessica Biel, who manged to rise above the rest, even when she's hardly trying. Along with Nick Swardson, who manages to hit the 'mock' button, these two were the only highlights in a horrible movie.

70,barrys82,a good comedy with a conscience,9,29 September 2007,"I liked this movie very much, by far the best comedy of the year. It is like a weird combination between Backdraft and Ladder 49 but in a humorous way. The story about two straight firefighters, Chuck and Larry, that are the best friends, pretend to be gay and get married to protect Larry's family was really good and entertaining with a convincing plot. The cast is wonderful, Adam Sandler as always with a great performance doing what he does best entertain and make people laugh. Kevin James is also excellent in his role of Larry Valentine and together they make an excellent humorist couple, the rhythm and the timing they have between them is just perfect. I never thought Jessica Biel could act in a comedy role, but she do it really well on this film, besides she looks sexier and more beautiful than ever. The supporting actor like Dan Akroyd, Steve Buscemi and Ving Rhames were fantastic, specially Rhames as a gay firefighter that seems to be very tough. David Spade and Rob Schneider deserves a special mention as the gay guy disguise as a sexy bunny at the party and as the Asian minister respectively, they were hilarious.

The whole opening sequence (the one with the twins) I kept thinking it was a dream sequence or something, but no. It was just some horny screen writer living out his pubescent fantasies. How pathetic.Sandler was the oh-so-bursting-with-testosterone-manly fire fighter banging one hot chick after another, James the clumsy-can't-cook-yet-endearing-widowed father just wanting to take care of his kid. How heart breaking. I turned this movie off after about five or ten minutes, simply because this was about the most homophobic garbage I have ever seen. Gay jokes can be funny, but building an entire movie around how yucky homosexuality is doesn't really sound like the 21st century to me.Admittedly, I didn't watch the entire movie. But let me guess what happens: I bet there's scene where they're forced to kiss each other, just to show how yucky it is being gay. I can picture the two doing the lemon-face (eyes and mouth pinched shut) closing in on each other with trembling lips.Sandler the man whore meets Jessica Biel, who doesn't fall for him at first, but in the end he learns what true love is all about, and they live happily ever after.James gets to keep his kid, and they live happily ever after.Ving Rhames, the quiet, scary and manliest fire fighter of them all reveals that he is gay, everyone hugs, shares a good laugh and live happily ever after.Save your money and your time.

There are many cameos and...(read more) brief appearances in the film, and all of them are utilized greatly. David Spade was my favorite cameo by far. Jessica Beil was perfect in her role and of course remained amazingly hot throughout the course of the film. Adam Sandler and Kevin James don't even need to carry the movie on their shoulders with what's going and all of the side characters, but they nevertheless seem to steal the spotlight numerous times.

73,ginocox-206-336968,A lowbrow version of Tootsie with strong performances in supporting roles,7,22 April 2015,"""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" is not likely to make anybody's list of top ten movies, but neither is it a candidate for the worst movie of the year, as Peter Sobczynski claims in his review. No movie featuring Jessica Biel in an extended scene wearing only a skimpy lingerie ensemble can be entirely bad. The premise is sound, a fish out of water story about two homophobic guys who pretend to be gay and learn to understand and respect gays. The premise is similar to ""Tootsie,"" although the execution is not as strong. Sandler is poorly self-cast as a Lothario who learns to love, while James plays a heartbroken single father who is unable to move on after the death of his wife. The structure is also reasonably strong. The McGuffin is a bit weak, but once the story begins, the two learn that being gay is not simply enacting a lot of stereotypical clichés, but also involves contending with a lot of prejudices and discrimination. They also learn that many of their acquaintances are homosexuals who do not fit their preconceived stereotypes. And they progress from being embarrassed by their charade to becoming vocal and active proponents of gay rights. The film offers solid performances in unexpected roles by Jessica Biel, Dan Aykroyd, Ving Rhames, Richard Chamberlain and others. Production values are more than adequate. The major flaw is in the writing, which limits the caliber of some of the performances. On one hand, the writing is hackneyed, derivative, obvious and in your face with scenes and situations that lack originality. On the other hand, it lacks focus, with scenes that don't propel the story, such as the justice of the peace played as a caricature of Japanese stereotypes. Sometimes this works, as with a character who has unexpected talents as a dancer, but at other times it seems to detract from the noble ambitions of the film with crude humor. One expects a homophobic character to make insulting remarks and jokes about gays, but that doesn't automatically carry license to also mock other groups. The characters have a series of encounters with homophobic associates, gays, closet homosexuals, gay rights activists and supportive individuals that serve as impetus for their maturation and acceptance of gays, but the encounters are presented so clumsily that they seem ineffective on either dramatic or a comedic grounds. The scenes and characters are also drawn very conservatively. Nobody is so homophobic as to seem vile, contemptible or despicable, so none of the characters has much room for growth and the attitude reversals that are seen don't seem entirely justified, based on the experiences seen by the audience. Sandler's character is particularly problematic. Sandler is a capable comedic actor who seems best suited to unjustly maligned Everyman roles. Most would probably consider him of better than average looks and physique; however, he's not likely to make anybody's list of hottest male actors. He plays a character with superhuman sexual prowess and effortless appeal to women, which comes off as more of a caricature of a womanizing playboy who belongs in a different film. Since his character is not believable, his emotional growth also seems unbelievable. There are bits that are humorous as isolated gags, although some are raunchy and politically incorrect, but they are integrated into a cohesive whole and distract from the central theme and throughline. The film's treatment of gays is a bit uneven. While a few characters are treated sympathetically as complex individuals, many are treated as stereotypes, particularly at a fundraiser party. The general message conveyed and learned is that gays are not as bad as you thought, but never suggests that gays are a positive force in society or that they make society stronger or that heterosexuals can learn something from them. Nothing balances out the jokes, jibes and caricatures. Parts of the film are subpar, but performances by Biel, Rhames and Aykroyd elevate it considerably.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

The pacing is very good and although this movie clocks in close to 2 hours its such fun ride it feels shorter then that. The humor is laugh out loud funny and there was also some moments in it that were tear jerkers.My only reason not leaving a ten mainly has to do with the ending.

With only this main idea to stretch the picture for almost twp hours is too much.Then there is the acting. Adam Sandler with all his talent seemed to be dim in this role, I guess he was not 100% satisfied with the part that he had to act.

In fact, I don't think there's anything wrong with the moral ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" hammers to the viewing public. The problem of the latest comedy from star/co-producer Adam Sandler, however, lies not in its message, but in how it's played out - with exasperatingly blatant approach complete with all the stereotypes as one could expect from, well, Adam Sandler.Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (Kevin Smith) are Brooklyn firefighters who have known each other since their days in the Academy. They are the best of friends despite their differences when it comes to members of the opposite sex. Larry is raising his two kids alone while still reeling from the death of her wife, while Chuck is the no-commitment type of guy who sleeps with different girls every night.But a flaw in New York's laws regarding same-sex domestic partnership has Larry doing the unthinkable: he asks Chuck to sign for a domestic partnership with him so that his children might benefit from the pension in case tragedy strikes. Of course, this raises suspicions and Chuck and Larry find themselves right under the city government's noses, and discrimination from their co-workers.What ensues is a case of having their cake and eating it too. The movie, directed by Dennis Dugan and penned by three screenwriters, are filled to the brim with recycled jokes and all homosexual and Asian stereotypes there is. It tells a one-note joke early on and then does nothing but rehash it. James, who virtually stole the show from Will Smith in ""Hitch"" is wasted with a forgettable turn as he mostly takes a backseat from Sandler's character. Jessica Biel, who plays the couple's attorney, is mostly here to provide the female factor.Yet for all the low-brow jabs it wants to be liked, so much so that it gets concerned on offending anyone, and that results to an awkward shift of course by preaching against the very practice it was doing. It may be well-intentioned but it comes off as a hypocritical and smarmy.

She plays the couple's lawyer, protecting the twosome from public judgment.Chuck Levine (Adam Sandler) and Larry Valentine (Kevin James of The King of Queens) are firemen and best buds since, like, forever. After an accident where Larry saves Chuck's life, widower Larry attempts to go around civic red tape to be able to name his kids as his life insurance beneficiaries by getting marriedto each other. Hilarity ensues when the straight men battle their new arrangement by appearing legit to a skeptical civil servant, and blows up into newsworthy heights.As with most of this cast's comedies, they always justify their gross-out toilet humor by always including an overarching moral of the story, in this case, faithfulness to obligations and being a good friend.But it's Biel who actually steals the show in her scene with Sandler. After a rainy ""girls' day"" shopping spree with the purportedly gay Chuck, she asks him for tips on how to land a man. She opines, ""The good guys really are either gay or marriedin your case, it's both."" Then right before a tear drops from those impossibly gorgeous brown eyes, Radiohead's ""High & Dry"" bursts in the background, she kisses him, they make out briefly then the disgust and the frustrationwhich I'm sure everyone can relate to worldwide.It's really hard not to just relax and enjoy this film; its lack of pretension is refreshing, and Little Nicky aside, you can always rely on Sandler and his team to make you laugh.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Paid critics are wrong again! This is one of the funniest Adam Sandler movie and not only is it funny but it will be loved by the Gay community and it has a very important point for the Republicans. We loved it. Kevin James, Jessica Biel, and everyone of Adam's buddies give an outstanding performance.To hell with the critics, what do they want? This is not one of those silly dumb movies (that we like anyway), but it has a wonderful point in it's plot. If you love any of these people you will love it.So go out and have a great time. Again we loved it and recommend it highly.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
81,Bravesfan17,"Not the best of Sandler's or Dugan's, but still fun to watch.",6,21 May 2010,"Dennis Dugan shows how much he likes to work with Adam Sandler, as this is their third outing together.Adam Sandler plays Chuck Levine, a firefighter who is also a playboy. This is another Adam Sandler character.Kevin James plays Larry Valentine, a widower firefighter who needs to take care of his kids. When he finds out that he can't change the beneficiary of his insurance from his deceased wife to his children, he asks for help from Chuck. Chuck reluctantly agrees so that he can be Larry's beneficiary.Along with the two leads is a love interest for Sandler's character. She is played by Jessica Biel. Biel plays Alex McDonough, the lawyer who is in charge of making sure that Chuck and Larry are a legitimate gay couple. However, Chuck can't stop looking at Alex.In the supporting cast are some of Sandler's buddies. Steve Buscemi plays a city worker who is strict on inspecting the trash and suspects that Chuck and Larry are faking it. Allen Covert, Blake Clark, David Spade, and Nicholas Turturro all make appearances. Dan Aykroyd plays the fire chief, and he can't believe what Chuck and Larry are trying to pull.Ving Rhames is hilarious in a supporting role as a transfer fire fighter, who looks tough and doesn't say anything, but then comes out of the closet.While this movie is not the best, it still has some funny laugh out loud moments.

Dan Ayckroyd is a very good actor. Ving Rhames is very funny. This movie is about gay firefighters that puts out fire in buildings in New York. There names where Chuck Levine and Larry Valentine. Chuck Then they got hurt and laying down in the hospital. Then Chuck was with Hooters girls inside a car. Then a little later they went to Niagra Falls to get married gay. Chuck had a girlfriend her name is Alex McDonough. So Chuck and Larry went to a costume party and need to find Alex Mcdonough. Chuck was dressed as a Vampire and Larry was dressed as an Apple.

85,simonparker1990,As Bad as I Feared!,2,22 September 2007,"I will begin my review by being honest and saying that I am not a fan of Adam Sandler movies whatsoever. In fact with the notable exception of Little Nicky, Happy Gilmore and just possibly Anger Management (mainly for Jack Nicholson) there aren't any Adam Sandler movies I really enjoy. So perhaps I was not the best person to judge this movie, I went in with a negative opinion and I came out with a negative opinion, I wondered as I was walking out of the cinema whether or not I just hate Adam Sandler movies too much for me to appreciate if it was a funny movie or not. And then the friend I saw it with looked at me and said ""well that sucked."" Now this does prove just how rubbish this movie is, the friend I saw this movie with is a huge Adam Sandler fan, he has all the movies and generally will lap up any comedy rubbish. But this movie I despised, and by that I mean he didn't shut up about how much he disliked it all the way home. So I was glad to realise I wasn't the only one to find this movie to be overlong, annoying and just plain offencive at times. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry has to be Adam Sandler at his all time worst. His character is unlikable at best, but Sandler's abysmal performance makes him downright hateful for the majority of the movie. The jokes here pretty much make a mockery of the moral this is trying to shove down our throats. The movie pretty much tries to be offencive to gay people, yet at the same time it tries to make out how equal we all are. Which made me a bit confused as I was never sure if this was laughing at gay people or laughing with gay people. Either way it fails miserably, the funny side of the movie being just too annoying and offencive to be entertaining and the sentimental side being so vomit inducing over the top it makes the movie even more unbearable. In fact this movie is so lose to getting 1/10 but is only just redeemed by maybe three redeeming features which I will get to a bit later in the review.So lets starts with the actors. Adam Sandler as I've said is abysmal in this movie. Now I dislike Adam Sandler, but I admit he can do funny. Happy Gilmore proved this to me, when he's given the right material he can work very well in a comedy. However this is very, very bad material, and it just makes my opinion of him sink even lower than it was before. The jokes he gets are basically how homophobic his character can be, in fact he spends the majority of the first half of the movie just being homophobic and pretending to be gay in a homophobic way. Matters aren't helped with Sandler by the fact for some obscure reason he chews gum in every scene, I wanted to scream at the screen whenever he started to chewing, why the hell did the director let him do it? Its just plain irritating. Thankfuly the other main character, played by Kevin James i a likable character who has a few funny lines. Unfortunately he seems to play second fiddle to Sandler's character. Had the focus been on Kevin James the movie might just have worked. Jessica Biel also shows up, or rather stands round in skimpy underwear, as you can guess she's a bit pointless and only put in for eye candy. The movie does one thing right by having Steve Buscemi show up as the villain, he's pretty great and has some funny lines in his all to brief screen time.So what is the main reason this movie goes horribly wrong? I mean the plot isn't awful, it was only a matter of time before people started laughing about gay marriage, but why oh why did this movie have to be the first one to do it? The comedy here pretty much is just offencive. First we get to laugh at fat people, in an actually stupidly unfunny sketch about the firemen trying to get a fat man out of a burning house. Then the focus settles purely on laughing at gay people, which means every gay stereotype imaginable shows up in this movie. We even get an obvious joke involving Brokeback Mountain! Its also ridiculous in the end just how many characters end up being gay, in fact by the end its a surprise when one character actually reveals he's straight and married! After endless people suddenly come out the closet or we have stereotypically camp men running round the screen you just get a bit irritated by it all. The moral of the story isn't awful, in fact had this actually fully laughed with gay people rather than at them this might have worked. Unfortunately all this does is contradict itself. Only one scene truly made me smile, and that has to be the actual marriage sequence, which garners a few laughs courtesy of a random tramp.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry definitely ends up being one of the worst movies of 2007. While not as awful as Epic Movie (not as far off it as you'd think) its worse than Employee of the Month. Its just a boring unfunny movie. And whatever fool decided to make this over two hours really needs his head examined!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

But more than anything else, this movie is really about friendship and male bonding.Adam Sandler is, well he's Adam Sandler and I'm struggling to think of Kevin James as anyone else other than Doug.The humour is sympathetic and tasteful and actually highlights prejudices that homosexuals face.

Larry's favour is that the pair become gay so that he can receive money from the death of his wife.In my view,this movie was better than the Australian movie ""Strange Bedfellows"" as it had more humour and a better cast. Some of the other cast members of this movie include Jessica Biel,Dan Aykroyd and Steve Buscemi as well as cameos by David Spade as a transsexual and Rob Schneider as the Japanese minister in the scenes shot in Canada.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
88,walken_on_sunshine,The King Of Queens,7,18 July 2007,"Adam Sandler and Kevin James are great in this hysterical and in the end uplifting comedy. You might be mis judging this comedy like most mis judged The Ringer as an excuse to crudely make fun of a specific group but like The Ringer it actually demonstrates a very positive message that people can learn from. Adam Sandler fans will love this movie because it's one of his better films in which he gives a funny performance without being too over the top like he was in Waterboy or Little Nicky. Kevin James is great as usual giving us a lovable good hearted character in which everything blows up in his face. These two make a great team for comedy as good and as lovable as Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or David Spade and Chris Farley truly two funny guys you love to see play off of each others performances. In terms of the humour style much like Click it fits everyone's style of humour as it contains random, slapstick, witty, uplifting, insulting, over the top, character, and crude humour. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry will have pretty much everyone laughing and in the end won't be offending or angering anyone. Those who thought Jessica Biel would add or detract from the quality of the film don't worry as she doesn't do either she just gives a pretty steady performance without overshadowing anyone else or being overshadowed by everyone else. I think Adam Sandler is on a role due to his later films being much more uplifting and funny rather than just over the top funny. If Adam Sandler keeps up with Reign Over Me, Click, and now Chuck and Larry he will remain as lovable and memorable as legends like Rodney Dangerfield and Leslie Nielson. Kevin James to put it simply is a sitcom actor meaning he has amazing comedic timing and can always keep you laughing with lines that if said by anyone else would'nt be funny a very bright future for him and a great step forward with Chuck and Larry. My only complaints are within the fact that it gets a little sappy, and the storyline gets too out of this world and unbelievable at certain points. Overall it's a great movie and a real accomplishment for both Adam Sandler and Kevin James.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
89,beauzee,"way over the top comedy succeeds on acting, writing.",8,15 March 2015,"as relatable as this 2007 film is to ""today"", it does have a few issues in...what?...believability? would a raging heterosexual assume the role of ""gay partner"" to help out his buddy in his goal of assuring that if he passes (he and Adam are firefighters) his children will have a good parent, in Adam? (James lost his screen wife recently and he is preoccupied with her memory and the reality that he could die at work).there's some discomfort with the handling of the subject of ""gay marriage"" as a ton of clichés do get thru in the wild horseplay. but the script is brilliant, and so is the acting and comedy editing.I see Sandler here, as a combo of Jerry Lewis, Al Pacino, and ...Adam Sandler.

92,Thunderbuck,Exceeded my (VERY) low expectations,6,2 August 2007,"I'm going to give I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY a very marginal recommendation, because it has a few odd moments, and its heart SEEMS to be in the right place.This is not always easy to see, because the humor seems to target gays more than it does gay-bashers. CHUCK AND LARRY is one of those movies that wants to have it both ways, preaching against stereotyping while using a lot of humor that depends on it.The premise is a bit flimsy--Larry needs to change the beneficiary on his pension because his wife has been dead a year. This kind of thing is usually taken care of by a 5 minute phone call (even if it DOES provide Rachel Dratch with an amusing cameo). And, with his wife deceased, Larry's benefits would go to his kids anyway. Second, the ""solution"" of entering a domestic partnership with a co-worker might be dishonest, but in the relationship portrayed in this particular movie, it wouldn't be illegal; both Chuck and Larry BOTH work for the same employer, and get the same benefits anyway.Beyond that, it's okay. Kevin James is the usual lovable-loser character, and I liked his scene where he reminds homophobic co-workers just who's been saving their butts over the years.The comedy doesn't really rise above sitcom level, but there are a couple of scenes that suggest some genuine compassion for gays. Not excellent, but not a total loss, either. I've seen worse.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
93,treeskier802,An Average Comedy,6,27 July 2007,"This film is basically an average comedy. You can poke a lot of holes in the plot and there is a lot of stupidity. Yet, there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. This is an entertaining film, but your own sense of humor should dictate whether you want to see it or not.Sandler and James play New York firefighters. The basic premise is that Kevin James' character finds a loophole in the system so that if he marries Sandler, his children will easily get his employee benefits. Without a wife, his children would be held in limbo by the state for a while before they get any benefits. This, of course, is a stretch, but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.So after James saves Sandler's life, Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is pro-gay I would say, so it shouldn't offend homosexuals, and Schneider is part Asian, so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway, all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun, but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily, then you probably should avoid this movie.Some nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler's best. At the same time, I don't think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
94,rondine,I liked it....,7,25 August 2008,"I recently saw Mr. Woodcock and let me say, perhaps the reason I liked this move so much was because that movie was so BAD. One of the worst comedies I've ever seen- couldn't even be called a comedy really.On to this movie though.... Is the premise somewhat unbelievable? yes. Is some of the humor dumb, childish or stereotypical? yes. Did this movie make me laugh? yes. Did I enjoy this movie? yes.I realize there were many badly stereotyped individuals in the movie- yet I was still able to see they were ultimately making a point which is summarized toward the end by their captain (I do not consider this a spoiler since I'm really giving nothing away):""And most importantly, they showed us that no matter whom we choose to love, be they heterosexual, homosexual, asexual, bisexual, trisexual, quadrisexual, pansexual, transsexual, omnisexual or that thing where the chick ties the belt around your neck and tinkles on a balloon, it has absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people!""I totally concur. I've never thought that what someone chooses to do at home in privacy is any of my business (this does exclude murder, hurting children & animals) - basically it doesn't make a bit of difference to who you are as a person. We are all of us so much more than just our sexual choice.Another thing I liked about this movie is that is showed how the main characters felt when discrimination came their way. Whether you're gay, overweight, a person of color, impoverished, or whatever minority you belong to- actually FEELING that kind of discrimination is very powerful. (I think of Gentleman's Agreement- great movie about feeling the pain of discrimination for both adults & children! In a way, this movie is similar to that one because they are pretending to be something they aren't- and that something is not the majority or the ""favored"" group!) I remember seeing the extra info on ""Shallow Hal"" and Paltrow commenting on just walking in the bar in her ""fat suit"" and how people wouldn't look her in the eye, wouldn't help her- she felt invisible. I really do believe if more people felt this horrible feeling, of being treated poorly for nothing you've done, there would be a lot more tolerance in the world.Overall, this movie made me LOL and I think they were going for a message of tolerance and understanding. Are there flaws? yes. But I think if you try and just enjoy the movie, you will find it's funny and a bit touching.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
95,Queen_of_pentacles,A lot of effort has gone behind this movie !,8,15 November 2007,"This movie is simply hilarious ! from dialogs to the cameos to the situations , every thing is carefully worked out , to tickle the funny bone. And yes, it does add to our meagre knowledge about the gay community .especially the gay party, with colorful costumes, and Chuck and Larry doing the high school number, when asked to show their moves, is fantastic. If the dialogs were not so well-written , then perhaps the comedy would have tended to be just another take on the sexual angle of American life style, like in those Rob Schneider's Gigolo sequels , or the Animal , where the idea of a human developing animal instincts , was used to create funny situations . Chuck and Larry also tackles the social angle of the domestic partnership , and though exaggerated to the extent of two straight men , one of them overactive in heterosexual relations , deciding to pose as a gay couple, and even getting married for authenticity , seems a little far-fetched, but o.k. for the theme as such. Child actors have added to the attraction , and give refreshing, natural performances. especially, the boy tap dancing , and doing splits , both the children coming in their bed room to wish good morning , and saying it to the maid as well . The bah room scene , when the bar of soap slips off , and every one scared to pick it up , that African-American muscle man actor finally picking it up, and gyrating while bathing happily , is really well taken. The final confrontation during the hearing , when the investigator, as well as the crowd demands that Chuck and Larry should kiss each other , their predicament , and confession , lends credibility to the movie , in a way , that sexual preferences can not be acted out , they have to be there inherently. Adam Sandler is good , but some how , seems a little lack lustre than his usual self . Aykroyd has also given a good performance, in his brief role . Team work is excellent . the director and the script writer , maintain a fine balance , while poking fun , and mostly do not indulge in vulgarity . However , the whole exercise becomes a little one-track, since it gets focused on the different ways in which the gay community leads their life . Though criticized as insulting to a particular race , Rob Schneider's unbilled cameo as the Asian minister is enjoyable , and could be considered more broad-mindedly , just for the sake of the fun in a gay wedding , and his description of the ring , which is a circle , and eternal , makes you laugh . The film does not claim to give any solutions, on the problems of a general negative attitude of the society towards gay people , since it's a comedy . yet there is a scene , when there is crowd demonstrating against them , and the only way that Chuck could reply is by punching the leader of the crowd , who happens to be a minister in a church. i wonder how the gay viewer would respond to this movie, but i read some where on this board , that even a gay friend of a straight fellow was in splits while watching it !",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
96,simplysoda_19f,I now pronounce you......Sandler and James,7,16 January 2008,"Adam Sandler and Kevin James play Chuck and Larry, two Brooklyn firefighters, who are also best buddies willing to do anything to help each other.

However, like some widows they find that a new wife, can't replace the one they lost, so he decides to replace his late wife with Adam Sandler. I have to agree Adam Sandler, would make a great husband, he's charming, funny and has got a great sense of humor.I love the fact that they included Niagra Falls, Canada in this movie, because of the fact that we allow gay marriages. Rob Schneider is very funny as the priest, and a couple more Adam Sandler movie regulars are in it as well. Jessica Biel is great as their social worker, I guess that's what you call her.The story is great, lot's of laughs, a few heart-to-heart moments, and it proves that anybody will do anything to help a friend in need, and I mean....ANYTHING.

97,sullibrandon,"Pure Comedic Fluff, but Still Funny",6,22 August 2007,"I'll admit, the trailers made me laugh. I'll admit, the idea of the whole thing intrigued me. I'll admit, even all the abysmally crappy reviews did little to deter my enthusiasm for this film. I'll admit another thing: the movie made me laugh. Despite being fairly obtuse in terms of sensitivity to homosexuality and getting too preachy in the last over-extended forty minutes, Chuck & Larry is a fairly harmless comedic romp with two very experienced comedians who know every beat by heart and line by name.Adam Sandler is Chuck, a homophobic manliest of men firemen, who sleeps with half a dozen women a week and consistently makes jokes jabbing gays. Kevin James is Larry, a widowed husband caring for two kids, who is not a womanizer like Chuck but still fairly prejudiced against homosexuality. Because of some financial difficulties, though, that come about through a rather far-fetched plot device, the two must go into a domestic partnership together so that Larry's kids can have someone to care for them if he dies in the line of duty. Never mind that Chuck is just as likely to die as Harry, as they are in the same line of work, but minor plot quibbles like this are insignificant compared to how much this movie made me laugh.I have no problem understanding why critics everywhere hated this movie. The homophobic jokes come at a consistent and, if looked at in the right way, annoying pace. James's and Sandler's characters are obtuse in their prejudices, up until the predictable point where they begin to experience some gay bashing themselves, which effectively teaches them the error of their ways and that yes, gays are people too. Sound offensive? Probably. Cheap? Surely. Funny? You bet. I'm not gonna lie, I laughed a lot during this movie. Normally I find Sandler kind of annoying, but he kept me reliably entertained. James is just as talented, if not more so, and the chemistry between the two is perfect for their roles. The low quality of this movie is unquestionable, but the enjoyment factor is completely dependent on your attitude. I don't have to agree with the prejudices portrayed in the movie to laugh at them. I can look past the see-through message of ""be nice go gays."" It's a one joke premise, pure and simple, and the movie never explores it beyond the ""haha these guys are uncomfortable acting gay"" bit. Blades of Glory was a one-joke premise too, though, and it received better critical ratings.One thing that I really didn't like was Jessica Biel's character, Alex, the lawyer, who is hired to protect Chuck & Larry from a snooping claim agent who is making sure they are actually gay. Chuck, of course, develops a massive crush on her and, because she believes he is gay, is privy to her, well, privvies. In one absolutely unbelievable scene Alex undresses completely in front of Chuck and forces him to feel her breasts, give her a foot rub, and teach her how to please a man, all exclaimed in a girly, ""oh you're gay so you can do anything to me"" voice. Nobody in their right mind would believe Chuck is gay for a second, but Alex falls for the act completely and her character is, subsequently, a naive little nymph simply put on screen for sex appeal. There are two other inspired roles in the film: Dan Aykroyd as the fire chief and Ving Rhames as a closet homosexual. Neither of them is technically truly funny, but because of the sheer ludicrousness and badness of the movie, their roles work, and they have complete fun with them.Now, let me state very clearly, that I do not think this film is good. What could have been an intelligent commentary on our prejudices towards the homosexuality community instead becomes an hour and fifty minutes of gay bashing. And what's with comedies always going to at least the 110 minute mark these days? What happened to the good old fashioned hour and a half of simple comedy that didn't overstay its welcome by a good twenty minutes? Despite its flaws, though, Chuck & Larry can easily be enjoyed if you just go into it and check all your reservations at the door, because if you want to, you will hate this movie. I wasn't sure what to think, and I ended up actually enjoying myself.

102,phillipstephenso,Manly Love,9,17 July 2007,"This film manages to drag out all the stereotypes about gays and gay marriage and to actually present them in an entertaining and even uplifting manner. There is something to be said for frankness, when dealing with the inner (and outer) gayness. So, there are subplots galore involving very horny men of various persuasions and closet gays, who are inspired to come out, based on their perceptions of the openly gay marriage of Adam Sandler and Kevin James.Adam and Kevin are hilarious as the New York firemen, who decide to undergo gay marriage, in order to gain domestic benefits. Their NYFD captain and the New York Government become suspicious, because of their long history of heterosexuality. So, an investigation commences. But, all the snitching in the world cannot break the bonds of male solidarity and affection in the end, between those firemen, who support each other and even save each other's lives.Along the way, Adam and Kevin find out that they deeply care for each other (as friends) and that gays are real human beings, too, who deserve courtesy and respect, instead of casual loathing and fear. Even Adam opens his eyes to the tremendous hurt visited upon gays, in regard to name-calling and contempt heaped upon them. So, Adam determines that he is not going to use the hurtful words about gays any more. Just as the NAACP buried the N word, Adam buries the F word.The film features tremendously beautiful choreography, cinematography, costumes, and music. And, one scene features the beautiful voice of Lance Bass, the out and about former member of 'Nsync.The humor and gags, as in just about all movies featuring Adam Sandler, just ""keep on coming."" And at the end of the movie, the audience at my preview show could not refrain from rotating palms onto palms and applauding this tremendous romp of a movie, which simultaneously entertains and inspires.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
103,orangeisthenewawesome,I really wanted to hate this movie,6,30 November 2008,"I could tell from the previews that this was going to be another slapstick, toilet humor typical Adam Sandler piece of garbage. And I was mostly right. What I didn't expect was that this movie has a lot of heart. I cringed through some of the worst jokes (ie - extricating a fat man from a burning house only to have him fall on Adam Sandler and then fart!) but also found myself rooting for Chuck and Larry in the end. This movie is actually quite respectful of gays and sensitive towards them. There's no gay bashing or judgment of lifestyle which I found showed a lot of restraint on the filmmaker's part. Kevin James is great. I think the guy may actually be a really good actor. Every time he's on screen in anything I've ever seen him in I can't help but root for the guy. Jessica Biel is super hot and plays the filler hot girl role well. Other small supporting roles are played well. Most notably Dan Akyroyd is over the top goofy as the chief. The only drag is Adam Sandler. His character might have been redeeming but Sandler doesn't know how to act or make the character likable. I could make some generalizations about Adam Sandler, the man, but I'll refrain. Anyway, he plays his character like the typical angry a-hole who for whatever reason is irresistible to all women. It's implausible really. Were he not in it or replaced by a better actor this movie might even have been very good. Instead, it's decent mindless comedy.I don't recommend it per se but I'd say it's not a total waste of time or money to sit through it if it's on HBO.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

It has to be, otherwise it isn't funny. I think Sandler did a great job at this. Maybe for some the jokes are too much, but Sandler also gets the right thing in this movie. By showing how terrible cliché people think about gays, he hits the spot.I had a great time watching it, the jokes were nicely done by Kevin James and Sandler.

Then again they were some things that were really different about this film like Ving Rhames's character who is just looking for a way to come out of the closet and other characters who always play gay parts in movies such as Nick Swardson. I can't forget Jessica Biel though, she is so hot in this film and does a great acting job too. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10 because it was really funny, but was a little different.

I have not seen such a blatantly unacceptable stereotype like that in years.... it reminded me of Jerry Lewis pretending to be Asian... with buck teeth, a horrible accent and coke-bottle glasses. Totally insulting, to my mind.The main problem with the film is that it is so completely juvenile that for most of the running time it is almost unbearable to watch. About three quarters of the way through, I actually began to like a few minutes here and there... especially anything done by the black gay fireman - he was truly funny - but for most of the film all I did was pray for it to end soon.One cameo role surprised me - Richard Chamberlain...who IS gay. I think that anyone who wants to put the film down for stereotypes should ask themselves why, if the film is truly offensive to gays, Richard Chamberlain would have accepted to be a part of it.My main beef, therefore, is simply that it is not funny. Unless you are a ten year old... or totally indiscriminating in your taste.For anyone who wants to see a truly gay film that is screamingly funny...rent out Another Gay Movie. It is a total parody of American Pie... but is done so well that I cannot praise it too much.

108,Listen_to_the_Law,Another funny outing from Sandler,7,2 September 2007,"Chuck & Larry -the characters and the movie- made me laugh. It's the typical Sandler movie- director Dugan was worked on countless Sandler projects, there is at least one hot girl (in this case, Jessica Biel who plays a easily turned-on lawyer), and the immature sense of humor that Sandler and James make work.The plot, which is basically the opposite of The Birdcage, deals with two New York firefighters, Chuck (Sandler) and Larry (James), who are as straight as can be. However, with Larry's wife dead and his kids needing health care, Larry goes as far-out as to suggest that that fake a gay partnership in order to get free child benefits. In order to be taken seriously, Chuck and Larry team up with Alex (Biel), a curvy and intelligent lawyer who handles cases like this. That's pretty much the story. The movie has jokes that intertwine with it, yet there is no part of the movie that I would call a ""laugh-riot."" The chuckles come and go quite frequently, with most of them being attributed to the good chemistry that Sandler and James have with each other. Some of the best laughs came from Larry's apple suit he wears to the gay nightclub, Larry's annoying nanny/babysitter in bed, and Chuck and Larry attempting to ""gay up"" their home to pass inspections. Chuck & Larry is a very fun yet forgettable movie.Good) Pace keeps the movie going, some funny moments Bad) Nothing special, no moments to send you into hysterics",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

It touches upon a sensitive subject such as homosexuality and uses it as a source of hilarity. I don't think any gay person would appreciate the nonsensical matter in this movie. As far as the acting goesthey did a pretty good job. I think it is just the fact that I am more conservative and not a great fan of crude humor (especially ones that don't make sense) that I didn't like it. Like Beowulf, I think this movie should in fact be rated ""R"" because of the many obscenities. I would like to comment on one scene when Chuck (Adam Sandler) is walking through the grocery store and sees all these lame things and puts them in the shopping cart muttering to himself: ""this is so gay."" Talk about double meanings. Also, the lawyer that Chuck develops a love relationship with at the end is either really really really really liberal or out of her MIND.

I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is a typical Sandler comedy. So if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this. However, I enjoy Sandler and so I enjoyed this. I actually think it's one of his better films. It has a great, funny cast including all of Sandler's regulars which show up at one point or another. And Kevin James, as always in my opinion, is great in it. It has some very funny moments and I really liked it. In comparison to some of Sandler's other work - Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore - it's not as good. But it is better than some of his other work. I think this film was just targeted by critics and Sandler haters to be bad but to be honest, it's probably the most versatile Sandler film in terms of the audience it could endure.

To me, love is love no matter race/sex/religion. I didn't find offense in this film, but it wasn't meant to offend. In the beginning, Chuck does say the word 'faggot' quite a lot which made me uncomfortable, but again, he was saying it as a word, not a derogatory term. I thought this film was very enjoyable and shows how Chuck goes from using that term, to defending them. He's accepted by this community, questions asked and he sees that they are just people living their lives how they feel they should. I think it's a good example of what people do think until they get to know someone who's gay. It was a movie about love, acceptance and respect and I think it excelled at it. Sure, there were gay jokes, but most of my gay friends loved to tell them and comment on how stupid and wrong they were. If this movie offended you, I'm quite sure that was not the film makers intentions, and just accept it as a eye opening film. There's lots of comedy, lots of good tender moments, and lots of some very sweet scenes showing the love these two men have for each other without being gay.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

There's a lot of pandering down to the audience with jokes and of those jokes, a high number of them are obviously gay jokes. Depending on your perception of gay issues, they might be viewed as gross-out jokes. It's hard to tell what the movie is going for. I imagine it will do little for gay rights because the way it presents itself and that's a shame because this would have been a great opportunity to open people up to accepting gay lifestyles. The ending tries to push that message across but then the ending takes the Hollywood way out and becomes very unrealistic.However, Kevin James and Adam Sandler mesh well and there are many cameos which help.

This movie was OK, and I did laugh a lot, but it's not THAT good. Mainly, I expected much better stuff from Sandler. Most of his jokes were immature, and quite stupid. This movie was immature in a lot of ways, which is the reason I felt like shooting myself whenever I laughed. It's not horrible, but far from what I expected based on how ""hyped-up"" this movie was. I just think that with an all-star cast like this one, they could've made it a hell of a lot funnier. And also, if you're thinking this is one of those dirty-humor comedies that actually has a message behind it, and that the message is pro-gay, think again. The only thing I really learned from this movie was how to insult a gay person until they wanna kill themselves. It's actually a very anti-gay movie, despite what it may seem like. I would recommend it to a big Adam Sandler fan, but overall you don't HAVE to see this movie. And if you're homosexual, stay very far away from this movie. I'm not quite ready to claim Sandler dead, but if this is all he can come up with, then he's very much dead in the comedy world. He can still redeem himself, too.

127,manhattanmoviemaniac,Very disappointing effort by a couple very funny guys,2,25 July 2007,"The gay issue premise of this dismal failure is only slightly better than its offensive execution. If this movie had been made twenty-five years ago, it could have had an Archie Bunker kind of appeal, but in the more accepting 21st century world (and in live and let live NYC of all places), the characters' initial attitudes are jaw-droppingly offensive. The inappropriate humor is not limited to alternative lifestyles either, as it flirts with racism and cruel weight jokes. All of this might have been easier to handle if the jokes were funny, but most are not. All that is left is a story that is disturbing in so many ways, I will not be able to tell them all to you.Sandler is super-stud fireman, Chuck Levine (pretty hard to buy, but what the hell, it's a comedy) whose life is saved by his fellow fire-eater and best friend, Larry Valentine (Kevin James). Larry has lost his wife and somehow his option to change the beneficiaries of his pension to his kids has elapsed (ridiculous, I know, but it's a comedy premise, what can you do). To solve this, Larry has to re-marry, but he is nowhere close to ready, so he proposes (literally) that he and Chuck pose as a same sex couple to assure his kids are taken care of. The city, apparently fooling with class action human rights' lawsuits is cracking down on fraud among purported same sex unions and sends out Clinton Fitzer (Steve Buscemi in a funny role) to investigate. Meanwhile, Chuck and Larry, frightened by potential jail terms, get a lawyer, played by the lovely Jessica Biel. Chuck falls for her, and the two become friends, but he can't let on that he is actually straight. The only thing that could make this part of the story worse be if Chuck somehow got a date with two women at once, as well (the old sit com stand-by plot). Or I guess they could have a zany KKK member around too. That would be worse. From the protesters at a gay gathering, to the city persecution of a lifestyle, and the 1950s reaction of their co-workers, this story is disturbingly distasteful and everyone's act three conversion is just not enough.As you may have guessed, I didn't like this movie and it got more grimaces than giggles out of me. It is as offensive as films from past generations, but those we can dismiss with a 'well, it was a different time, wasn't it?' excuse. I can't see this being enjoyed by anyone besides homophobic idiots and adolescent boys goggling Jessica Biel (true, she looks fantastic. I kinda liked that part, too). Adam Sandler always seems to dance on the line of appropriate humor and I often enjoy his efforts even when they are not politically correct, but this time out he has stumbled completely over that line and he is unlikely to generate enough smiles from most viewers to make it OK. As for Kevin James, if he wants to make the jump from the small screen to something larger with individual seats and public restrooms, he is going to have to choose better projects than this.(This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com)",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

134,dogankurban,So gays are not that horrible and they also have feelings,7,19 February 2009,"I think that this movie is the most political one Adam Sandler has ever made. Of course it is a comedy, however, it also criticizes the absurdity in some laws and it shows us very well how the thoughts of a bunch of firemen change about the ""gay community."" I think the choosing of firemen was a very good choice, because they are like brothers, they are all guys, and they are heroes. The movie shows us how the relations change when they learn some of their brothers are ""gay."" The movie shows us that when you call a gay person f..., he is really hurt, and we also see that gay people don't try to sleep with every heterosexual men around them. While doing these, the movie continues making fun of gays being gay. I think watching this movie with buddies and making crude remarks is fun, however, it would still make you stop and think, are gay people that horrible?",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
135,Reel_World,"Two Points for Biel's ""assets"" - None for the movie.",2,2 November 2007,"Two points for Biel's ""assets"". No points for the film.Sandler follows up his performance in ""Reign over Me"" by reverting to shtick that has the quality of fourth grade bathroom humor. Don't get me wrong - I loved ""Gilmore"" and ""Madison"", but this film was just awful! Pulling every gay stereotypical joke out of the proverbial hat, and then trying to back step at the end with a Seinfeld-esquire ""There's nothing wrong with that"" finale.I don't think I laughed even once through this film. Kevin James just doesn't do it for me. Sandler can be funny, but in this film he missed the mark entirely.Littered with cameos by Sandler's out of work friends from SNL, and even managing to get Dan Aykroyd on screen again - this film is beyond salvage. Even with a free rental at the store, avoid this film at all costs and watch ""Reign over Me"" if you want to see Sandler in a movie.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
136,madmax_thegamer,I now pronounce this movie...funny!,7,20 July 2007,"OK at the risk of sounding like a teenage girl lets start things off this way. OMG I was ROFL! For any of you out there not up to date with your chat or texting lingo, that stands for oh my god, I was rolling on the floor laughing. I caught this movie with a friend of mine, and having seen the trailers for it on other films was not expecting a whole lot. I knew there would be that scene with Jessica in her underwear though, and believe me, as a guy I was not disappointed at all. But all underwear scenes aside, this movie is actually a lot of fun, it lacks most of Adam Sandlers typical stupid humor, I.E. Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison and sticks to a more adult joke oriented brand similar to Big Daddy, rather than throwing one slapstick situation after another at the viewer. Kevin James is his usual likable self, portraying a mostly average Joe. When Larry (James) discovers that he is going to be unable to change his insurance policy, he cooks up a scheme so that his best friend Chuck (Sandler) will become the beneficiary, and be able to take care of his kids. The only problem, they have to enter a domestic partnership and appear to be gay. Chuck who is quite the ladies man reluctantly goes along with the plan to help his friend. Many many many humorous situations follow and the two men, with the help of a gorgeous lawyer (Biel) discover an understanding and acceptance for something they used to be repelled by. Overall I throughly enjoyed Chuck and Larry, having not expected much, was pleasantly surprised and walked away still laughing about certain scenes. Both men and women should enjoy this for it's humor and the good time it is, although it might skew a bit more towards the guys due to the parading around of women in skimpy outfits in certain parts.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
137,rblade963,And the moral of the story is ...,5,10 September 2008,"Why do comedies have to approach subjects with some kind of moral lesson to be learned? Isn't the reason most of us see a comedy is to laugh and not have to think about weighted or serious topics? Sure if done well you can lighten up a serious topic with some funny or put some funny in a horror film but when you start out with funny why not keep it that way? Comedies are probably the hardest films to make IMO there is only the directer and the crew that are saying ""Hey, this is funny"" point is a comedy is very hard to pull off, timing is everything, the way the film is edited is everything, and the talent of your actors to pull off the funny is also everything. If just one of these elements are not right a comedy can fail terribly.I would have rather seen a more nonsensical film about two strait guys getting married and keep the laughs going. But the film stops so many places to remind us that hatred towards gays is wrong. Any non-idiot knows that only idiots protest against someones rights. So why, why the big moral lesson in what could have been a very funny, light hearted, film.I would have removed the religious protest group, the outnumbered scenes of homo phobia some were funny some, just too many or drawn out too long. I wanted more interaction between the kids and Chuck and Larry more scenes with the lawyer and brother, just more hilarious interaction between fewer characters in the film. Then wrap it up as they did. The ending was good. And a good place in any comedy to make a serious point but then leave them laughing.So, yea I liked the film. Was it a real comedy? That's something of an opinion, to me no to a hundred other people it would be a comedy. I think it's a more serous work that makes you stop and think and stop and think and they threw in some funny to lighten up a serious topic.My favorite parts of the film; Ving Rhames each and every scene the guy was in. The man is phenomenal. If you have seen ""Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead"" you'll understand what I'm talking about, talk about a versatile actor. And Jessica Biel what a beautiful woman she is, not the lead comedian in the film by any stretch of the imagination but OMG she has my vote as the sexiest woman of 2008! Anyway my two cents it's not a total waist of time to see. If your expecting a light hearted romp threw comedy with Adam Sandler this is not the movie for you.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
138,An_Hedonic,Better than bad... much better,7,15 August 2007,"This may be the only Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen but I'm familiar enough with him. I'd never seen Kevin James in anything. I wasn't expecting much and this movie was a pleasant surprise on 2 fronts. 1) Sandler and James charade exposes them to the ridiculous homophobia still so prevalent in U.S. society. 2) the great take on the sissy boy -- James's father is supportive, if not always understanding, of his son and daughter as they are, even if the boy is a flaming stereotype homo kid. More than the lesson about tolerance of adult sexual orientation, the sissy son shows kids are different and should not be shoved into strict gender-defining terms, especially in regard to sexuality at an early age. The world would be a lot better for many children if they weren't forced into extremes at either end of masculine/feminine, male/female norms (or light skin/dark skin, upper class/lower class, rich/poor, theist/atheist, or other dichotomies). As Ving Rhames's character says, once he comes out, ""To thine own self be true.""",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
139,3s2m,The 700 Club couldn't come up with a better piece of gay-bashing,1,13 March 2008,"Is it possible to claim to support marriage rights for same-sex couples and still be homophobic? After seeing ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" the answer is yes. Two heterosexual Brooklyn firemen (Kevin James and Adam Sandler) file a domestic partnership claim so that one of the men can protect his children in case of his death, him being a widower. In spite of the specious setup, the opportunities for a charming farce were all there, but Sandler (and director Dennis ""as an actor I was who they got when they couldn't get Bruce Dern so I now direct bad comedies instead"" Dugan) mucked it up with a bunch of lame jokes and condescending stereotypes of gays.The woman (Jessica Biel) who advises Chuck and Larry to beware of a fraud investigation is a heterosexual woman with a flaming queen for a brother. Everyone at the AIDS benefit is a voguing, prancing flamer dressed in costumes that would make Elton John squirm, and when anti-gay protesters crowd the outside of the building where the event is held, only Adam Sandler and Jessica Biel's characters have the courage to stand up to them at all. In another scene, the mailman hits on one of them. What's worse is Kevin James' character's effeminate son. Apparently because he wants to try out for the school musical and can dance, he must be gay.This is not an issue of political correctness, which I abhor. In fact, I don't mind gay jokes that are funny. But there's a line between jokes about homosexuality and making fun of gays, which this movie crosses like it was the finish line of the 100 yard dash. This film's message is apparently that ""gays are sick freaks, but let them get married anyway."" That is a profoundly anti-gay message. SInce GLAAD approved this film just as they also approved the patronizing BS of ""Will and Grace"" and ""Queer as Folk"", they ought to change their name to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Intellectual Honesty. Adding insult to that injury, the film's funny moments are too few and far between.What's perplexing is how Barry Fanaro, a former writer for ""The Golden Girls,"" a classic 1980s sitcom which had a few episodes about non-stereotyped gays, got into this mess. I guess Lifetime Network's been stiffing him on residuals and he's sick of Ramen Noodles. There is also an embarrassingly bad performance by Rob Schneider as an Asian justice of the peace. In fact, I'm more offended by this than Mickey Rooney's character in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's;"" at least that film could use the excuse that it was 1961, but there's no excuse here. That the untalented Schneider is half-Filipino does not make it better. And how did Dan Aykroyd or the obnoxious David Spade get involved in this bigoted debacle? With all the SNL alumni in this vomit-inducing garbage, I guess I'll be watching MAD TV from now on.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

141,Shevy1103,Wedding Balls...,9,20 March 2013,"The movie was hilariously hilarious. There was a big smile on my face during 98% of the movie, give or take a couple of percent. And I laughed more than I usually do, even when I watch comedies. I didn't think it would be any good, but Kevin James and Mr. Sandler really pulled trough. After seeing this movie I would say that they are the perfect ""couple"". All their comments and outbursts and their body language were brilliant, and to top it off, Ving Rhames kicked ass, he seriously kicked ass! Even though both Kevin James and Adam Sandler's acting were amazingly good (I've actually never seen either one of them act better than they did in this movie) I would have to say that Ving Rhames was my favorite in this movie, (You know, alongside the butterfly and the Japanese priest).The storyline was great, it was filled with things you couldn't see coming, not in a million years. The happy-sad curve went up and down perfectly. The sound was nearly impeccable, as was the lighting, the shooting, places where they shot it was more than just fitting and the acting really was impeccable, or as close to it as you can get at least. There was some fails or goofs if you will, but there always are, so. I noticed 3 of them, there are probably some more, but you can't get'em all. For those of you new to this expression, the most common fails are: forgetting to take of your jacket before you go ""on stage"", misplacement of items on set during takes (or shoots if you will) or the all so popular; mouth not following the audio.So, I conclude with this: the movie was brilliantly awesome and hilarious it will definitely make you laugh. It had the perfect music to go with the different scenes. The start was really good, the build up was as well, the mid-part was awesome and the finish was perfect. No better way to end a movie than with a gay marriage and a calendar like that one.My rating of ""I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry"" is therefore: 9 out of 10 stars.This is one movie I definitely recommend you buy, watch, watch again and tell your friends about.

Guess not as this movie is whack-you-in-your-face listen to me and don't argue stuff. Entertaining? Only if your brain is empty and you need it filled by some dolt wielding a sledgehammer.

Not to mention I really really really hate Adam Sandler. And to be fair, The first portion of the movie nearly vindicated my opinion going in.A cringe-worthy scene where Chuck (Sandler) tries to get twin sisters to tongue kiss in an extremely annoying Bronx accent that made me want to hunt Sandler down and bash his face in with a brick comes to mind.So does a scene where the two title characters rescue a fat guy from a fire. Naturally, he's so fat that he can't walk, Sandler cracks a mega-clever fart joke, and they inevitably fall down/off of/onto something.So does most of the first 30 minutes of the movie, actually.But then the movie improves. It refrains the the typical low-brow fart-joke Asians-talk-funny humor that normally pervades Sandler's movies. Grant it, there is an Asian who talks funny, but even that isn't as obnoxious and offensive as you might think.All and all, Chuck and Larry has heart to it, which is what makes it work in my eyes. There's a moral to the story. And although it's completely predictable and somewhat cliché, it works.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

There are a few amusing cameos (my favorite being Dave Matthews as a flamboyant personal shopper). But I think the overall joke hit to miss ratio is probably something like 1 in 10. Sandler and James are just fine in their roles, but they didn't have much to work with. The story doesn't really work- way too many holes, even for a comedy. I think the movie just loses it's touch by going back and forth between overly general, unflattering depictions of homosexuals and sloppy attempts to make Chuck and Larry folk heroes to the gay community. All if it is done in such a way that none of it is believable.

152,mr_mcpimpington,One of Sandler's Worst?,6,3 August 2007,"If your asking this guy I would definitely say that it is. Of course I believe every funny movie he's made has been all downhill since Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. There were a few watchable movies after those first two biggies, such as Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates (Drew Barrymore connection?), and Click. There were also a few bargain bin losers such as Little Nicky, The Longest Yard, The Waterboy and Mr. Deeds. I'd say Chuck and Larry fall into this bargain bin group, kept afloat by it's running punch line of two straight guys acting gay.The jokes are cheap, and usually take about 10 seconds to set up. There's no real depth of comedy being developed here. Just one liner after one liner involving gay jokes. But hey, there's really nothing wrong with that if it's done properly ... after all, it is a comedy and nothing is untouchable when it comes to comedy. However, after watching it I realize it could've been so much better if they just took the time to set up some characters for long awkward moments. Instead the whole thing is just too zingy for me. I almost feel as if this movie would've been better 10 years ago instead of in today's society where the ""ice"" (so to speak) has already been broken on gay jokes/gay genre. I'm sorry, two straight guys kissing in front of a crowd of people is just not as funny as it was a decade ago. It's been done a million times already.This is not to say the movie is completely devoid of humor b/c there are plenty of attempts to get a laugh during it's 2 hours and I'm sure everyone will find something they can laugh at, I did. Just don't expect the movie to be as funny as the two lead actors can be, because it's just not. Rob Schneider's character as an Asian minister is easily the funniest role in the entire movie, and will no doubt enduce some laughter ... but when Rob Schneider conjures up the most laughs, isn't that in itself a tragedy?

I don't mind sexism, raunch, gay jokes, racist jokes if they are done well or are funny, or are in some way necessary to the plot or the characters.

Having said that I think this movie will clean up at the Oscars and could even win the Best Film category. After all it is the kind of gay oriented movie that the Academy might appreciate for once: A lightweight, easy to follow subject with ample lashings of homophobia.

Most people who gave this movie a bad rating thought it was offensive... Now I just can't understand why? Yes this movie had stereotypes, but let's be honest, almost EVERY character was a stereotype! And that was one of things that was funny about this movie. Even Sandler played a stereotype: Good looking guy that ""plays"" girls and thinks that he is the most important. Think about it. Also, someone said it before, when someone made a wrong joke or said fowl language about gays, he was called names at and certainly not respected. They even said a million times that the word ""faggot"" is offensive. Also, Stereotypes are designed to be funny. How many people do you think are exactly like the characters in this movie? And when you laugh at a character, does that mean you make fun of all the people the character is loosely based upon? Come on people loose the ""uptightness"". Watch the movie again and think about it, it's a funny movie with a good moral. Certainly not a waste of time. And even though it's not a movie that gets you to roll on the floor laughing, it certainly makes you smile big time every now and then :)Have fun.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

Chuck (Adam Sandler) & Larry (Kevin James) are a fantastic comedic duo that act gay in order to change the beneficiary benefits from Larry's death wife to his children. Everything is going fine until Clint Fitzer (Steve Buscemi) is trying to find out if this is a fraud, which it is, so Chuck & Larry are going to have to go to extreme faking gay in order to get Fitzer off their back. Lawyer Alex McDonough (Jessica Biel) also gets involved in this story actually believing that they are gay.

Let me start by saying that the premise of the movie is ridiculous in itself, but then it only gets worse with the countless unbelievable scenes including a finale which includes a ""public hearing"" (literally) which tests the legitimacy of Chuck and Larry's so called gay relationship. I don't know what was worse; the producers/writers stupid ideas of what being gay means or the stupid tired gay clichés. This movie REALLY stinks people ... I mean REALLY REALLY stinks. The three stars I gave this mess are for the decent soundtrack.

Always funny to throw the word ""Faggot"" and the uncountable gay jokes through-out the entire movie. But to everyone else, this is extremely offensive. Being bi-sexual, it is easy to get a feeling for both sides.Over all, this was funny movie, but many parts were extremely uncomfortable, and almost good enough to walk out on. For example, hearing your comedic hero say ""faggot"" in such a way that makes you ill.The movie was extremely stereotypical with homosexuals, which is the worst part. Not every gay goes out dancing and talks with a lisp and trying to have sex with any guy they can get their hands on...What this movie did do was give awareness of the struggles of the gay community. Other than that, it was mostly offensive, and somewhat funny. Ving's character was easily the best in my opinion.I wouldn't suggest this movie to easily offended people.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

But, we're living the times that we're living and things do matter and things mean more than what they mean and everything means something. So, who's idea was this? Reactionary even in its attempt to be compassionate, tolerant and understanding. The film is not an insult to the issue of gays and gay marriage but to comedy itself. For instance: Chuck and Larry firefighters try to save a massively overweight man from a fire, the man falls on top of them and farts. Yep, that's the standard. Of course the movie opened to grosses large enough to demote Harry Potter himself to second place so they know what they're doing and I'm not sure what planet I'm living in. Richard Chamberlain and Lance Bass make special appearances, oh dear, oh dear. The appeal of Adam Sandler is way beyond me. I kind of liked him in in the PT Anderson movie and in Spanglish he was alright but those films didn't quite perform at the box office so I fear that Chuck and Larry is here to stay.

Figured ""INPYC&L"" to be a continuation of that.Unfortunately, I was wrong.Many of the jokes were poor, even by ""Sandler Standards."" The Gay jokes were not clever for themost part, and the additions of characters that were lackluster (David Spade as an overwrought fairy, the Japanese Minister in Toronto, and even Ving Rhames coming out) - poorly done.Sandler gave a so-so performance. Kevin James was relatively strong. Jessica Biel was awful.

I haven't really seen that many movies with Adam Sandler in them, but the ones I've seen, I've liked them, so I thought, hey, Adam's in a gay movie, great!...I guess to the eyes of most straights who are not that involved in the gay thing, the jokes in the movie were awesome.. yeah... it's all stereotypes and we make fun of the stereotypes everywhere... but that is the thing... while stereotypes are made fun of, they don't really educate, clarify, or any similar, and that, to the gay community is something very crucial at this point of the history... At this point, the gay community NEEDS that the mainstream knows what homosexuality REALLY is..The movie presents gays as all being sissies, effeminate, girly, etc... come to think of it... even the grumpy fireman who turned out to be gay (being the reason to all his anger, as he was afraid of coming out) ended up being a sissie..Now, don't take me wrong... sissies have nothing wrong... they're actually fabulous, and they are PART of the DIVERSITY of the gay community... but they are not the total... there are a HUGE more types of people, just like in the ""straight community"" and it's not fair that we gays are always thought of as girly guys who squeal when they see a mouse, once again, not because there's something wrong with that, but because it's just not the way everyone is... after all, everyone is entitled to individuality.Some of you have seen it, for example, in the ""Brokeback Mountain"" film. Those two cowboys, being bisexual both of them, were not at all sissies, but there wasn't much problem with that movie in the sense that it dealed with only two... however this time in the Adam Sandler movie ALL LGBT people is presented as being gay...catch my grip?",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

Great jokes and sense of humor, a Sandler in a macho man part that almost suits him and a very sensitive chubby guy, that would do everything for his kids. I watched the original movie (maybe you didn't know, but there is a similar movie, made in Australia, in which the first actor is the guy that acted in Crocodile Dundee)and I really liked it, so when I first got the chance to watch ""I know..."" I was sure it would be a bit lousy (a Hollywood remake of an Australian movie with British humor about homosexuals didn't sound that good). But I was wrong. There are very funny lines and scenes, there's a hooked story and some great actors having fun acting their parts. The only thing the the Australian movie did better was a more realistic view over the gay problems and the motivation for two straight guys to get married.

Suffice to say, I was extremely disappointed and can honestly say that i did not laugh once throughout the entire movie (even in my merry state!). My judgement in not against the actors, I have admired all the cast in previous films. It was obvious that the script was well below average standard.jeez! watching this was a huge come down and sobered me up in 30 mins! I just watched the rest of the film to be polite. And honestly...

172,lorgurus,I should have seen Harry Potter or Hairspray!,5,22 July 2007,"I'll admit it, I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. I am one of the few people who actually prefer him in his more serious roles, like in Spanglish. I was drawn to this movie by Kevin James, who really can make me laugh.I had seen the trailer, and was pretty sure it wouldn't be a GREAT movie, but I was in the mood to see something light-hearted and humorous today. I figured that Kevin James would make it worth my while and my seven bucks.Unfortunately, after seeing it, I'm sure I would have had a much better time watching four back-to-back King of Queens reruns.Everything here is exaggerated. Stereotypes about women, gays, Asians, Italians, African Americans (you name it) abound. Chuck, a womanizer, sleeps with not one or two women at a time, but the entire Hooter's staff plus his female physician. These woman giggle and spank each other while they await Chuck's return to bed. Everything is predictable. The premise is simple and contrived.Cameo performances by Dave Matthews, Lance Bass and Richard Chamberlain are its best moments. (And figuring out that Rob Schneider is the heavily costumed Asian minister.)If you love everything Adam Sandler does, this may do it for you. If you are on the fence, I recommend waiting for the DVD or skipping it altogether.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
173,mimi_murlough,"Insulting to everyone who's not a white male, but to to the gay community most of all.",1,14 August 2010,"I went into the movie with very low expectations, having read about how awful it was with regards to gay stereotypes. But what I didn't expect was for everyone who isn't a white straight male to be stereotyped. There were only two men who weren't white in the entire movie; one was an Asian caricature to a degree that I thought was extinct since the fifties, and the other one is the only black guy on the force – so of course he also doubles as the huge scary (crazy) guy. He's notable becomes a double offense when he, form the moment that he comes out of the closet, turns into a mincing sissy. This is supposed to be comedic, because can you imagine a big black guy who isn't scary? Or a black guy who I gay? What a hoot! The movie also suffers from rampant misogyny, depicting every single woman as a first class idiot who's naturally all over Chuck. Mind you that this trait has nothing to do with Chuck being handsome, charming or anything else. In fact, his way of seduction is to mock and insult his target, then expecting them to obey his every command (which they incredibly do). He's not just this way to women either, in fact he constantly makes homophobic comments and treats his so called best friend like dirt, including turning his plea for help down without as much as a thought and having sex with his maid in his bed, while Larry's still in it and mere minutes after Larry clearly described how hard it was for him to let anyone sleep on his wife's side. Then there's the treatment of the issue at hand, of course. Apart from the raging stereotypes, it's as if the writers have no idea how homophobia works. The supposedly progressive lawyer asks the ""couple"" who is the chick – a question that is one of the parade signs of ignorance on homosexuality. Then she asks him out on a ""girl day"", basically trying to turn him into the gay pet cliché. The main characters themselves also continue to look slightly panicked in the presence of gay men, even as they go through a supposed character development.As bad as this, or even worse, is that this movie about homosexuality is completely devoid of homosexuality. Really, there is no same sex love or attraction going on here at all except in the last five minutes or so. And then it's only a quick wedding between the two most prominent gay characters (as in the only gay characters with more than one line), who never even been shown on screen together before that. Even a fake kiss between the leads is avoided at all costs and treated like something absolutely horrific! Not to mention the often cited assurances of their heterosexuality in the form of an avalanche of female conquests and a dearly beloved wife respectively. Adding insult to injury, all the homophobia that we get to experience is directed against two straight men that are rather homophobic themselves – it's all just an act, so if they do feel hurt it's not on a personal level. With the contradictions I've mentioned earlier, it seems like the purpose for this movie isn't to deal with homophobia, but to make straight men the heroes of gay people á la every mighty whitey story in history. Think about it; they never actually did anything to gain their heroic status. They were exposed as a fraud and then loads of people wanted them freed because I don't know. I really don't. They have done nothing for their community aside from punching an anti gay activist in the face. If this is really enough to gain iconic status in spite of everything else, I can't see it as anything short of degrading the community to make Chuck (Larry is nothing but a sidekick, really) look like a hero with minimal effort. This is a minority that has claimed enormous improvements in their treatment these past fifteen years, who turn major cities into sanctuaries for diversity for a week of the year, and that at least in the US has rioted multiple times when the authorities went a step too far against them. But in this movie they don't dare lift a finger unless a straight man or woman takes the first step. And just like that, there goes the last drop of credibility that this train wreck of a movie might have had. This is where some might wave my concerns off as sensitive and say that this isn't relevant to comedy. But fact is that timing, acting, or even Larry's rather sweet character can't save this movie after all the misogyny, homophobia, racism and what not that it's built upon. If you're not a white and mildly homophobic male, chances are that the continuous insults will ruin the fun.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
174,david-1479,a nice remake,8,29 July 2007,"When I first read the outline of 'Strange Bedfellows' it had all signs of a possible gay-unfriendly story. I saw it on Canal+ (some HBO-like channel) early 2006. Don't know if it even made it to cinema here. I saw the film three times since. If you like a story about respect, acceptance and tolerance, changing opinions on just getting in touch with a so far unknown group, this film is for you. It's all about friendship after all. 'I now pronounce...' in outline had all signs of a possible gay-unfriendly story, nowhere announced as such, but possibly a remake. It in fact has the same theme, story outline, even some details. The humour is somewhat less subtile than in the Australian original, in some cases over the top even, but then it made me laugh instead of chuckle. The remake kept with it's different approach the original intact. The Big City settings might make it more appealing for a wide audience than the Australian rural settings from the original. Both films have the main issues in common: respect, acceptance, tolerance and friendship. And that's what things are about.

176,Rjdogboy18,Sand Man returns big time,9,28 July 2007,"Adam ""Sand Man"" Sandler is one of the most creative and amazing comedy actors around. However his career was slowing down with funny but quirky movies like 50 first dates and Spanglish. Adam never hit rock bottom with his acting yet but he sails under the radar for a while. He made it big with classic hits like The Wedding singer, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore & Waterboy. Sandler has also put his talent to work in more dramatic films such as the 1996 film Bulletproof in which Sandler plays a character who is into the drug path in life, his character makes friends with a undercover cop who had been long undercover keeping an eye on Sandlers character. Bulletproof to some is a flop and is to be considered trash, but some like myself say it was Sandler at one his best times.I know pronounce you Chuck and Larry in my opinion is a huge turning stone for Sandler. I see many many many more movies to come because he did such a great job with this movie. Every actor in the movie no matter how small their part kicked ass. This movie wasn't looking too promising by the previews but when you go and watch it you will die laughing.Cameo appearances by recent out of the closet homosexual boy band singer Lance Bass was great. It was nice to see a movie that could be funny and slightly insulting (insult comedy) be so creative and respectful by sending out gay support theme and being able to get the attention of many different types of viewers.Kevin James did an outstanding job in this film. Remember that guy who was on a few episodes of Everybody loves Raymond and got his own show called King of Queens? yea that guy who did a few parts in movies like 50 first dates, Hitch, & Grilled well he got out of the shadow of ""bigger names"" and co stars in this film with Sandler and you couldn't tell who the star or co star was because of the great focus on both characters and the amazing acting skill of both James and Sandler.In my opinion everyone should see this movie!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

I'm not homophobic, but there was too much of it in this movie.Also, remember the ""are you and dad homosexicles?"" line? Guess what: They removed it, and a lot of other scenes to get the film a pg13 rating. A movie about two straight gay men getting married to receive domestic partnership benefits is pretty much the same as finding nemo in a child's mind, but throw in dirty language or references to sex and their little minds are scrambled.This is a horrible movie, and the only funny parts are the Asian guy and the maxi-pads part. There was too much of a ""gays are people too, gays have just as much rights as you do, blah blah blah"" mood, and it ruined the movie in my opinion.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised, and while it gets a little too politically correct for my taste, it is in essence a 90 minute fag joke, and will truly have you laughing out loud for almost the entire movie. The only complaint is that it ran a little too long, and the end, as previously stated, gets a little to P.C., yet is funnier than anything I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended for fans of comedy, Adam Sandler, or a good old-fashioned fag joke. You just have to love this movie.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
190,don_hardy,Political Grandstanding,1,9 August 2007,"A few laughs but more of a political statement for gay rights. Was not entertaining. Gay rights was more of the topic than entertainment value. I think that folks can make up their own minds without Hollywood shoving their ideologies down our throats when we are expecting to be entertained.Some movies make subtle statements. This one has clear special interest intentions unlike Water boy, Anger Management and Billy Madison which were funny, silly and just funny movies to watch.Sorry Adam, this one is way over the top on the political side.Sorry I went.Don",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

192,life_as_a_decoy,love...but not in love,9,9 March 2007,"Last night I went to a screening of this film and didn't know what to expect. I have to say this is the best Adam Sandler comedy since Happy Gilmore. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back. This story is about two firefighters in Brooklyn who have been best friends for what seems like forever. Larry Valentine (James) is a single dad trying to raise two kids on his own and Chuck Levine (Sandler) is a notorious playboy who has a new girl(s) every night. When Larry tries to change his beneficiary from his late wife to his children he finds out that the process would take a long time. Because he's a firefighter, and worries that he could go at anytime, he wants to make sure his kids will be OK. After a traumatic incident he feels even more pressure. When he finds a loophole in the system, he asks Chuck to be his domestic partner. Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney, Alex (Jessica Beal), who believes they're gay, to save them from criminal charges. They try to keep their relationship a secret but it eventually gets out that they're a couple. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. Little do they know, when they defend themselves, they defend gay people in general. Dan Aykroyd plays their Captain at the fire house and is also their voice of reason. Steve Buscemi plays an inspector who is sent to their house to catch them at their game. There are numerous cameos, by some of everyone's favorites, and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. When I left the theater I felt like a did 100 crunches because I was laughing so hard. It didn't drag, and it didn't get overly sappy, at any point. Some of the jokes are stereotypical, but it's the first time most of them have been on the big screen so it was fresh humor. I sat next to my gay friend through the screening and I've never seen a man laugh so hard in my entire life. So, for all you people who think this movie will be a bash at homosexuals, I say watch the movie and then make your opinions. I enjoyed this movie so much that, when it comes out in July, I will PAY to go see it with my friends.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

194,painpete,Funniest Film ever !!!,8,2 November 2007,"at first i was afraid that the mix of Kevin James and Adam Sander wouldn't work, these are two of my favourite comedy actors Kevin James in king of queens is hilarious and Adam Sander from films such as happy Gilmore and big daddy, click and all the others. This is a perfect comedy match. I saw the trailer for this film in America while i was on holiday and it was a must see for me.This film has a great story line, Adam Sander plays the part of chuck, the most heterosexual person on earth, who's life is saved by Larry a close friend who is in need of a favour, because of a stupid tax law, the two straight men pretend to be gay to avoid the tax deductions. Larry assures chuck that they would only be partners on paper but when Clinton fitzer starts snooping around the two men have to become allot closer to convince him that they are truly gay.This film features some very funny comedy moments as the movie progresses the wedding scene with a very funny Asian character, it also has meaning to the story showing peoples opinions can often be wrong.In conclusion this film is a must see for those who love comedy, it was my film of the summer",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
195,Lucin24,Great COMEDY,8,26 July 2007,"Its disappointing seeing people bash movies because it doesn't do everything exactly right. ""This movie doesn't help gay rights enough. That must have been the only point of this movie, so this movie sucks."" I guess I just don't get the logic. Rather than seeing it as ""Hey, here's a comedy movie with an easy plot that actually tries to help a cause that's been messed up for so many years"" its bashed for not having a Departed-esquire plot twist-fest, or not fighting enough for gay rights.If you're some jerk that looks for tiny flaws so you can come cry that point for three paragraphs then this joins every other movie in the world, so this is the movie for you. If you're an average person looking to escape life for a few hours and have a few laughs, then this is the movie for you.Its a great comedy, Adam Sandler and Kevin James deliver the laughs all movie long, as do the variety of typical Sandler actors/actresses. And it goes without saying that Jessica Biel is beautiful, and has the acting skills to go along with it.Is there corny drama? Absolutely. Does that take away from the movie? Why should it? Not every movie needs the ""Pay it Forward"" tragedy to make it a good movie.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
196,lilxghit369,I Now Pronounce You a Good Movie!,10,27 July 2007,"A movie about homosexual rights, made by a group of straight filmmakers for a straight audience, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry is an agreeably stereotypical comedy. Teetering on the border of obnoxiousness and humorous, Chuck & Larry manages to wedge every single gay joke in the book into one film while still managing to leave audiences with a palatable, albeit forced, message of intolerance. While the summer comedy won't set the world on fire, it might be just flaming enough to turn a few heads.While trying to ensure that his children receive his life insurance benefits, New York fireman Larry Valentine (Kevin James) gets caught in a web of bureaucratic loopholes. Turning to the one friend he can trust, fellow firefighter and macho bachelor, Chuck (Adam Sandler), the two concoct a scheme to take advantage of domestic partnership rights by posing as a gay couple.When the proposal is quickly and rightfully challenged by the city of New York, the ambiguously gay duo hires and ogles a smoking hot defense lawyer, Alex (Jessica Biel). Quickly falling for Alex's good looks and charm Chuck finds himself in a tight spot, either reveal the fact that he is a straight man and risk sending both Larry and himself to jail or enjoy his lawyer's company as merely ""Friends forever"".With the most recent rewrite of this long in development comedy penned by the writers who brought you Sideways, one might expect the humor and build up to be a bit more poignant than Chuck & Larry winds up being. Produced by Adam Sandler's shingle, Happy Madison, the film never manages to step out of tepid waters, and nearly voids its stance to have its two lead characters escape from a nearly impossible dilemma.While some may criticize the film for its macho protagonists being characterized as overly straight, exemplified by them bringing home gaggles of supermodels and Hooters hostesses, plus subscribing to a variety of porno rags, these traits are unfortunately a necessity. While most audiences that will frown upon Chuck & Larry for its shallowness are probably well versed in tolerating alternative forms of sexual lifestyles, the film is ultimately targeting homophobes.Aside from inspired performances from Cole Morgan, who plays Larry's flamboyant young son, everyone else in the film is rather good when it comes to challenging these stereotypes, but at the same time this makes Chuck & Larry far more accessible to a wider audience. Had the film allowed the title characters to give up their struggle with trying to hide their masculinity it could have easily damaged some of the good-natured, and dare I say gay, chemistry that is shared by most domestic partners. All in all this movie was great, gay(pun intended)and gets a 10 out of 10.(IMO)",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
197,pgb-12,"Gave it a chance, but it failed to rise from college teen humor",3,20 July 2007,"Before I went to this movie, considering actors Kevin and Adam, I hoped this movie did NOT have the cliché teen/ college humor/underwear/wedgie gags running through it, that it did NOT have a social and political morality popping up every 30 minutes, NOT having a feelgood moment every 20 minutes, and NOT trying be a desperate, predictable merger of teenage movies for 18-21 year old and silly situation comedy movies I thought belonged to the 90's. I even suspect the movie trying to reach the audience of ie The Sweetest thing, Holiday and other girl-movies and chick lit. And the dialogues are too much of a kind, trying to pull off a laugh by saying silly and embarrassing things. But I think it all fails big time. As a guy I should say there is a high dose of gorgeous girls and flashes, which makes is more than suitable for the less-sophisticated average male viewer I guess. But being a not-so-average viewer (I won't 'more sophisticated' for now) it is way overdone and kills off any attempt for this movie to rise from teen/college humour level.I know Kevin James only a bit from the series Kings of Queens, mostly because he doesn't stand out much. I know Adam Sandler mostly because he manages to irritate me in all his movies, regardless of the movies being good or bad (although I liked him in Anger Management). He manages quite well in this movie, and I must say it's nice to see him play a more macho role, complete with a NY accent, instead of always being the push over and mumbeling jack ass. Nevertheless it's no good to rescue the movie.Unless you plan to kill time with the lads and have a lot of beers at your sides, skip this movie.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
198,dm8887,A movie that straddles the fence,5,22 July 2007,"This movie had some very funny moments. The writing was good, and as always the cast from Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, and Mr.Deeds all made appearances. Some good gags, and witty humor. However.....The problem comes when you confront the issues it brings up. This movie pleased neither pro-gay, nor anti-gay sides. It was a movie that insulted both sides of the issue, mostly during the more serious parts. The movie used derogatory slang towards gay people too much, and many times it seemed unnecessary. It poked fun at some of the homosexual stereotypes, and they went overboard during some of the jokes.Towards the end of the movie, it changes position, and it goes from ""lets make fun of gays"", to ""lets make anyone who doesn't agree with their lifestyle look incredibly stupid"". I was disappointed at the end when it seemed like the writers tried to ""fix"" their earlier transgressions by making the last 10 minutes a bashing of anyone who doesn't accept the gay lifestyle. The movie felt undecided over the issue because it visited both extremes of the spectrum. You leave the movie not knowing whether to feel insulted or entertained.It is tough to make a movie like this, however, I would have liked to see less derogatory jokes, and less bashing of groups of people in general.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
199,irukandjiimdb,It's highly enjoyable minus some absurdities.,7,13 September 2007,"Knowing that this is an Adam Sandler film, I did expect some great fun. I mean, the homosexual type of fun. And obviously, I was not disappointed. This movie delivers sidesplitting laughs to most of its audience (at least, where I watched it). Kevin James also proved that he really does best in comedy - not in any other genre yet.Well, the movie can be unpleasant for some people who have sensitivities on gender and yes, of size. Except for some minor inconsistencies and far too many stereotypes, the movie is generally a funny and likable film especially for those who enjoy Adam Sandler's previous movies.Anyway, if you came looking for laughs, you'll get more than that. You will enjoy this and go to bed feeling happy! However, if you came as a critic - looking for holes and flaws in the film, you won't be disappointed either.But hey...to hell with criticisms.

200,shalikh,coarse and crude,1,14 November 2007,"crude. In every sense! The humor is so vulgar sometimes that i covered my eyes. The moments with footage of female back wearing underwear are longer than the funny moments. May be not offensive to gays, it certainly is offensive to women. The script doesn't seem to have any destination...except when it announces something suddenly. No buildup of events or anything. They created the scenes with the kids' potential sexuality but left it hanging. No reaction by the children after the news-paper 'coming out 'of their fathers.They didn't even use this silence to create a tension before the kids' part in the courtroom. The editing is pretty jerky. It even seems weak on the technical side. Maybe the reason that they took seven years to make this film is lack of money. yes, they brought up a timely topic- loving your same-sex friend as a heterosexual. And also how a typical homophobic may change mind when put through the same ill-treatment etc. But both of the messages are actually belittled by this third-rated failure of a comedy. I gave it 1 because it introduced me to the film 'strange bedfellows'. I hope to find in that one whatever i didn't get in this one.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
201,mattrobhowes,Hopeless,1,7 September 2011,I got given a free ticket to this film but still wanted my money back! The film was funny for the first 30 minutes but then the comedy seemed to stop and the film seemed to take on an lecturing tone that was not in any way subtle. It was as if the producers were so afraid that the subject matter might offend that they went into overkill and bludgeoned us over the head with the prevailing view on the subject about 17 times just in case we hadn't got the message. Whether you happen to agree with them on that subject is not the issue. The director could have woven these ideas carefully into the storyline but instead the whole film grinds to a halt to allow a cheesy moralising speech straight to camera. When did it become OK to lecture people in this way in the middle of a comedy film which they are trying to relax and enjoy? Does such a lecture absolve you from responsibility for poking fun of people for the rest of the movie? Will Smith's films are also notorious for his 10 minute lectures on America's greatness and the merits of freedom but at least he earned the right to do that by saving the world.,I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

OK, the gags are not very innovative but I had to laugh a dozen times. This movie didn't betray me. I got what I have expected. I like Adam Sandler movies because of their simplicity. There have to be films that are easy to watch without being very attentive. So this movies can be watched to relax and to laugh. I think that it is a little bit underrated here.

I walked out feeling like my mortal soul had been removed. I felt like I had to go home and take a shower to clean this crap out of my head. There are almost no socially redeeming values in this movie (save for a speech near the end to accept each other for who we are) and the movie is not even remotely entertaining! As a person who has a gay friend who has also seen this movie and was insulted, thats 4 different ZERO's on this movie. All 4 agreed that the very misleading previews shown on TV are mildly tame by comparison and showed that this movie MIGHT be a LITTLE funny, but once you are seated the filth rolls out for over 2 hours.

209,vicandlis,Review of Film,10,15 October 2007,"Just a quick one really (pardon the pun). Initially the last thing I wanted to watch was another film where Adam Sandler basically played the buffoon without acting (water boy,little Nicky, etc, etc (I hated them all). Having watched the film, I have to convey an unreserved and genuine apology to Mr Sandler not least because it is probably the funniest film that I have seen in many years.The quality of the script supported by the outstanding acting of all cast members (especially the little girl) made me cry with laughter.My only criticism was that I thought Sandler would get it on with the lawyer who in turn would transpire to be a 'pre-op' transsexual (there were a couple of cryptic lines that could have been the basis for greater things).To think that a blatant homophobic would get it on; accept and marry a transsexual would have been a fitting end to a fab script.None-the-less I am going to watch this film whenever I feel down because it made me laugh, cry and appreciate good quality humour.Thanks!!!",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

Several minutes into the movie I turned to my best friend and whispered ""What have these guys dragged us to?"" and rolled my eyes at the movie that I assumed would be another hour and a half of male oriented comedy. I was way wrong. Half an hour into the movie my sides hurt from laughing, and by the end I couldn't stop smiling at not only the humour, but the surprising good moral taught by this movie. What begins as lame humour accompanied by nearly naked women, quickly turns into a heart-warming comedy about friendship and the definition of love. Not to say it doesn't still have a fair bit of goofiness and humour, because there's definitely a lot of that too; hilarious movie in my opinion. I ended up being so glad we had chosen to attend this movie. When I saw the previews weeks before I hadn't even considered going to see it, but now I'm happy I did.

As I expected, it set the scene for a lot of awkward and funny moments. But after the easy jokes were played out, it shifted to advancing the gay movement agenda while and by portraying Americans as closed-minded and Christians as cruel and vitriolic. I just wish I could go to a movie now days that isn't saturated with liberal politics. This is the 'culture war' that conservatives speak about. It's called social engineering, and Hollywood has made it clear which direction it would like to mold society.

217,kelvin-klin,Surprisingly Different,7,12 August 2007,"With the potential for comedy that gay firemen and the physical contrast that Kevin James and Adam Sandler present, Chuck and Larry is very subdued. There is a noticeable absence of scenes that any classic comedy could include, the prolonging of an awkward situation or capturing a situation's spiral into chaos and absurdity, and the often exaggerated representation of a gay man by a straight man, a caricature such as Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno, in comedic settings are all conspicuously few in Chuck and Larry. In this sense, it fails the true aim of a comedy, and the foundations, the themes on which the script and plot are constructed, lend no momentum to the comic force of the movie. That is not to say this film lacks humour entirely, just that it is not as upfront as one would expect. It has its gems, though they are at times far in between, and though the film disappoints its potential, you will find yourself laughing. Laughing, however, is not the only reaction you will have to this movie. Chuck and Larry manages to present the issue of gender equality and sensitivity in the familiar and comfortable vehicle of a buddy comedy. In showing straight men tackling the challenges homophobia, it makes obvious the ignorance that causes and motivates discrimination. For a comedy to successfully deliver such a clear message without feeling burdened by that responsibility is ""Chuck and Larry""'s saving grace, and indeed redeems it as a film.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

This movie showed how many people act towards other people in real life and i thought it was pretty funny how u found out that some of the people turned out to be gay near the end.I thought it was a great movie and to be put on the same pedestal as Blades of Glory, Talladega Nights,Waterboy, Billy Madison, Little Nicky ,and one of my favorites Happy Gilmore.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
223,lily7174,HUGE disappointment,1,22 July 2007,"I have never felt so strongly against a movie to comment on it in a forum like this, but this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I'm Asian-American, and I'm incredibly offended by the stereotypical Asian that Rob Schneider played. I thought the days of such racially charged humor was gone with characters like Charlie Chan, but apparently Adam Sandler wanted to bring this ugliness back.If Schneider had portrayed a stereotypical black person, there would be much more of a fuss about this movie. In the old days of segregation, whites would paint themselves black and act out exaggerated stereotypes. This is now considered racist today but somehow accepted when directed against Asians.I realize that Schneider is half-Filipino, but the fact of the matter is, he doesn't look like the stereotypical Asian that he played (the slanty eyes, the buck-teeth, the myopic image with pidgin English). I would guess that he had never experienced any racism or discrimination for looking Asian.There aren't very many Asians in movies. When there is one, it would be nice if they play roles that went beyond their race. This includes the girls--conveniently all Asian--who accompanied MySpace's Tila Tequila as the promiscuous (a common Asian female stereotype) clique who obsess over Adam Sandler.We're all Americans, and it's about time that the media recognizes this as well.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

I would give them the ratings because Kevin James is one of my favorite comedians! The moral of this movie was well thought out and it kinda made you see how people may see the gay community and marriages. Really how narrow minded people may be. I found it fun,family oriented,and funny. Seeing Adam Sandler break out of his sport oriented movies or goofy side.. and see him on a kinda more serious level was entertaining. Where ever he is though he is always goofy with some kind of seriousness. Kevin James suited the part also, because he's used to that seriousness from his hit show "" King Of Queens"" with Kari, but for him to actually play a gay part was shocking.

The storyline was relatively interesting and many of the jokes were funny. It is not offensive as some people try and make it. Even Lance Bass makes an appearance in the end of the film and if a high profile gay celebrity is OK with it, so am I.It is full of gay jokes and stereotypes (obviously); however the redeeming factor is how the movie comes out and makes a point that words like ""faggot"" are very offensive and hurtful. The movie also displays many of the problems and stereotypes that gays face today in America. If someone is offended by the movie chances are they missed the point and just focused on the gay jokes or maybe they didn't watch how the plot developed and the characters changed.

Kevin James however I do like, but his abilities are squandered in this pitiful attempt at a romantic comedy. I agree with all the negative points others have posted here, and would like to add that there is just too much unbelievability in this movie to give it any kind of foundation upon which to have comedy. We're supposed to accept that someone who looks like Adam Sandler is ""Mr. February"" in a fireman's calendar? C'mon.

The Christians were rude, abusive, and I would have wanted to punch them myself. On the other hand, there is no presentation of Christians as anything in a positive light. Even with that, I wouldn't have minded if they had shown something in the advertising to warn me about the political nature of the movie.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is even a moderately conservative Christian or thinks homosexuality is immoral.

If you are offended you should take a look at all the stereotypes and generalizations daytime talk-shows and reality TV shows make; the angry black guy, the overly feminine gay guy, it's ridiculous. Two the point was to show how ignorant people can be when they find out somebody is different than them no-matter race or gender. It is all about acceptance. This movie is a comedy and was hilarious at parts. I thought some parts were overly stupid or overly trying to prove a point, but all in all it was very funny.

I am from a very conservative family and I also married into one. My husband and I went to see this movie not knowing what to expect, and it was very upsetting. We kept saying after we left, ""we should have known better""... I was ready to leave after Jessica Beil's character said something about the Christians (who were standing out front of a night club with a bullhorn yelling obscenities) being miserable and trying to make all the gay people at the party just as miserable as they were. That was a wonderful way of Hollywood mocking Christians as they do so well, having a Southern preacher in front of a New York night club calling people names and telling them they are going to spend eternity in hell. Anyone who reads the Bible knows that we are not to judge other people, we can judge other Christians, as brothers and sisters in Christ. We are not the judge. God is the judge. That's fine if Hollywood wants to make fun of Christians, Jews, black people, gays, Asians etc but we all need to realized that it's the same thing over and over. Everyone can make fun of themselves, but the minute someone else says something ""offensive"" we get angry. This movie targeted many ""groups"" of people, that could have been the plot to make a point about homosexuality, I don't know. What I do know is that this movie was offensive to many and I'm upset that I spent time and money to see it.

But, I reminded myself that it was a comedy and I let the movie's ridiculous premise go. Still, there wasn't much to laugh at in the movie. I'm heterosexual but felt it made fun of gay people and played up stereotypes. Why was just about everyone at an AIDS fund raiser flamboyantly gay? Why did the wedding chapel guy have to have stereotyped Asian speech and appearance reminiscent of racist films from the 1930s? (I know Rob Schneider is part Filipino, but it was still bad).

To hear kids use words like ""lesbian"" isn't good at all. Also, having Sandler's character make fun of a guy's wife that died to the widower (James), sure wasn't funny, and the portrayal of those who oppose gay marriage as a bunch of nerdy, geeky, yelling lunatics is definitely a political statement that I could do without.

Sandler apparently has his own movie production company named ""Happy Madison"" and has used this lack of oversight by a third party to simply go no holds barred with the crudeness in this film. The film should not have lost it's rating of ""R"" by simply removing a scene where the characters Chuck and Larry kiss at the end. The film is basically a soft pornography and I am appalled that this material is considered suitable for 13 year old children. I watched approximately thirty minutes of this film waiting for the content to tame and then could not stomach another minute and had to turn it off. Adam Sandler and the movie industry should both be ashamed of themselves. Sandler for the film and the industry for it's lack of ability to properly rate the content of such films.

It appears there was a race to produce a movie along the same story lines with a few tweaks and Australia won.

240,nogard8910,A Rather Poor Excuse for a Movie,3,1 May 2008,"Despite the groundbreaking nature of a pro-gay comedy, I found the movie to be severely lacking in both plot and characterization. It is repeatedly thrown in our faces that Chuck (Adam Sandler) is a ladies man to the point of sheer ridiculousness, such as having scantily clad women (including one who had earlier appeared disgusted at his womanizing personality) running all over his apartment in the middle of the night. The decision to pretend to be gay feels very forced, something that has the potential to be looked over should the rest of the movie be of good quality; however, the movie fails to achieve this.The film takes the standard comedic formula of placing the protagonists in a variety of awkward situations. The premise involves a government man trying to expose them as straight, forcing them to behave in a stereotypically gay manner. Though the film is based upon the concept of discouraging homophobia by showing two sympathetic protagonists (known by the viewer to be straight) having to go through the bullying gay men do, this is thwarted by the film's own inability to depict gay men as anything other than stereotype. A heartwarming monologue denouncing homophobia includes a long list of sexual orientations including bisexuality; despite this, it would appear that the filmmakers had little understanding of the concept, as Chuck's interest in females is used as ""evidence"" against the legitimacy of the domestic partnership.Message or meaning aside, the script in general is quite poor. Characters are half-baked stereotypes, their motivations at times somewhat unclear as they are forced into unlikely situations. Some scenes appear to have been constructed entirely from the erotic fantasy of heterosexual males, rather than anything consistent with reality. I can imagine the filmmakers wanted to make a pro-gay movie, slapped a script together, and sent it into production before it achieved significant quality.In short, I find this movie a huge disappointment. It's worth a few laughs, but fails to be very likable overall. Watch it with friends and get some snacks to bolster your enjoyment.",I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry

252,penroyaltea,Made me a bit angry,3,1 August 2007,"If fart jokes and predictable plot/gags are your thing, then you surely won't be disappointed. The setup is promising enough, two hetero guys in masculine (some might suggest homoerotic) job such as firemen, get a civil partnership in order to reap the benefits if Chuck (who isn't covered by similar life insurance policies, unusual in a fireman- the same cynical few would say), dies in a toasty manor... cue 'flaming queen jokes' You can't help but wonder if Southpark's Awesome-O pretend robot could do a much better job at picking Sandler's movie choices.The plot (for what it's worth) was allegedly 'borrowed' by Rob Schneider (will get to him later) from the movie Strange Bedfellows (2004, Paul Hogan) and then passed on to Adam Sandler when the were in 'Animal'. The first half of the film is given to proving that Larry is somewhat of a ladies man, and like, totally not a gay; coercing two sisters he is cheating on at the same time to kiss, bedding strippers 4 at a time (...ok we get the point Sandler) and other such activities that are only permissible through a somewhat strenuous suspension of disbelief. Chuck on the other hand, is a family man who has recently lost his wife, has a daughter and rather camp son who he doesn't understand, but has a talent for doing the splits that does raise a wry smile.The turning point in the film is when Chuck and Larry 'rescue' a morbidly obese man from a fire, wisecracking all the way, escorting him out through the burning building (without any form of breathing apparatus) they trip and, predictably he lands on Sandler. And then farts. nope...didn't see that one coming either. Later on Chuck saves Larry's life and then owes him one so he makes him marry him. Fine...whatever...I'm not giving myself a hernia with this one. The presentation of women in the film is truly the grimmest spectacle since White Chicks. They are brainless top-heavy morons whose only purpose in this film is to swoon over the irresistible charms of Sandlers character. One is a Doctor, one is a Lawyer...both are apparently pole dancers, and gullible ones at that.The only redeeming feature of the film is that in order to achieve a saccharine, preachy ending, the characters of Chuck and Larry soften in their attitude to gays, even though from 'What, you mean like f*ggots?' the only way can surely be up, and the jury is out whether you can spend 99% of the time saying 'f*ggots are wrong and weird', and the end 1% saying, 'sure they're wrong and weird, but the correct vernacular is 'gay'. (I gave one star for the use of the word vernacular in such a low-brow film)What is such a let down in the film, save every labored setup and grim inevitable gag, is such a rich mine was not tapped, not even skimmed. All cultures are funny, especially gays they're ripe, even ridiculous in parts. Where were the references to Brokeback Mountain (a film needing a good spoofing if e'er there was one) the Birdcag-esquire situations? Even 'In and Out'...at least steal some decent gay jokes.It is a sad reflection of the LBGT community that they are so trod upon that the best they can hope for is;""in its own disarming way, it's a call for equality and respect.""(GLAAD) ...REALLY? Hey, I'm glad these people don't represent me...so in its own way Benny Hill was a plea for understanding in a world of a masculine oppression? right? You can make a big deal of the 'yellowing-up' Chinese character played by Schneider, with 'me so solly' etc, but it's not worth your time, society has moved on and this is barely post-ironic, just pathetic.More disturbing is the underlying homophobia throughout the film. There is no heart, no empathy, all the jokes are cruel and lame and will do nobody any favors. Except Sandler who will win an MTV award for comedic performance, get $25,000,000 at the least and sit smugly in his mansion knowing that every race, sexuality and religion save his own has been rightly put in its place.So is this just harmless entertainment? or a disgusting endorsement of every cruel playground stereotype...you decide.
