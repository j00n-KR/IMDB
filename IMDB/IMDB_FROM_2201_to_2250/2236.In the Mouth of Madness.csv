0,bkoganbing,Hobb's Lane,5,17 September 2008,"Films like In The Mouth Of Madness are admittedly not my cup of tea. Still when a writer of horror lives in a place like Hobb's Lane in New Hampshire, that's an open invitation to stay away.Noted Stephen King like horror story writer Jurgen Prochnow has disappeared and he's a guy who's even more secretive than J.D. Salinger in his quest for privacy. But he's missed a deadline and he's got a load of fans out there who are actually rioting because they are salivating over a new novel.Concerned about his contract, the advance they've given, the general investment they have in Prochnow, Charlton Heston, Prochnow's publisher has hired insurance investigator Sam Neill to locate this guy who they can't find. They used to communicate with him through his agent, but almost at the film's beginning the agent goes berserk and starts taking an ax to people and is shot down.Protecting his investment further, Heston sends Julie Carmen his girl Friday along with Neill where they discover Hobb's Lane, New Hampshire. Remember this is New England, host of the Salem Witch Trials back in the day, and they know Satan and his works when they see it. These people keep clear of a place like Hobb's Lane, but Neill and Carmen go blundering in and meet up with Prochnow and it's an experience to put it mildly.The ending is one pessimistic one for the human race, but I've got a theological question worth pondering. If reading works like this from the mind of Satan himself affect people so powerfully as described here, why doesn't reading the Bible, or C.S. Lewis, or Lloyd C. Douglas, or G.K. Chesterton have a similar affect?I'm not a big fan of this genre in general, but those devoted to these films should have enough fright and violence to satisfy.",In the Mouth of Madness
1,SnoopyStyle,nature of reality,6,5 December 2015,"Dr. Wrenn comes to interview volatile psych patient John Trent (Sam Neill). Trent was an independent insurance investigator. The movie flashes back to an ax welding stranger who tells him about successful horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow). Publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) asks him to find the missing Cane. People seems to turn violent from Cane's books. The next book is suppose to be In the Mouth of Madness. Using the book covers, Trent discovers the location of Hobb's End, New Hampshire. Harglow sends editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) to join Trent on the search.This is more ambitious than most slasher horrors. It tries to bring in the nature of reality. It's rather disjointed with random apparitions. Essentially, nothing is real and therefore there is nothing solid to hold on to. Sam Neill is great but Julie Carmen is not particularly good. The premise is interesting but it's not that thrilling.",In the Mouth of Madness
2,claudio_carvalho,Changing the Reality,7,6 August 2007,"The efficient and skeptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by the publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) might be. After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in the readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, ""Horror in Hobb's End"". There is a mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a strategy of marketing. John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to New Hampshire seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End. While driving along the night, Linda reaches the Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town, and his twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those that read his novels.""In the Mouth of Madness"" is a journey to fear and madness through the darkness of a twisted mind of a writer. This story follows the style of ""Twilight Zone"" and actually shows how a writer with the support of the media is able to manipulate hearts and minds. Further, there is a certain criticism in the values and standards of the society where those who think differently or have a different behavior are outcast or even considered crazy. John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors and Sam Neil is perfect in the role of a skeptical man, used to find schemes and con everywhere, having difficulties to accept what is happening. The conclusion is very dark and without perspective to mankind. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""À Beira da Loucura"" (""On the Edge of Madness"")Note: On 23 June 2015 I saw this movie again.

3,gavin6942,One of Carpenter's Better Films?,7,11 March 2013,"An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational.I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed.Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing ""Vampires"" and ""Ghosts of Mars"". And with the exception of ""Cigarette Burns"", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years.Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's ""Dagon""). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.",In the Mouth of Madness
4,lee_eisenberg,"read, they say",7,10 November 2006,"First, I will say that the events portrayed in John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"" are some of the most outlandish things ever to grace the silver screen. Second, I will say that I'm glad that it's like that: this movie is supposed to be outlandish. I've liked every John Carpenter movie that I've seen, and this is one of them (of course, I can't vouch for the ones that I haven't seen). Portraying a horror novel affecting people in evil ways, they throw in anything that they want.Are there any parts of the movie where they got just too far out to merit any credit? Maybe one such scene is the part where Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) tears himself open, but what happens to John Trent (Sam Neill) right after that more than makes up for anything unrealistic in the movie. And then, what he discovers about Hobb's End raises the stakes even further.So, while the plot line may border on complete nonsense, they keep it cool by not taking anything too seriously. Worth seeing, if only once. And remember this movie the next time that you decide to read a book; it might just save your life.I bet that back in the days when Charlton Heston was starring in movies like ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"" - not to mention participating in civil rights marches - he never imagined that he would co-star in a movie like this.",In the Mouth of Madness
5,rmax304823,The Adventure Of The Disappearing Author.,3,28 January 2011,"My usually reliable TV Guide gave this three stars out of four and described it as the story of a horror writer (think Stephen King) who has gone missing. There's also a rumor floating around that those who read his works go mad. The publisher, a splendidly aged Charlton Heston, is distressed over the loss of his cash cow and coaxes the prosaic Sam Neill to search for him. Neill skims through some of the author's books and dismisses them as routine plots, though better written than he'd expected.Well -- okay. It might be interesting.My heart sank when I saw the prominence in the credits given to ""Special Visual Effects."" When I saw it was directed by John Carpenter the depths became positively benthic, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway and hope for the best.The opening was tranquil and sane enough. Sam Neill isn't an actor given to menace or outrage. But five minutes into the film, a bald and drooling madman smashes through a restaurant window and attacks Neill with an ax. It gets worse when Neill begins to hallucinate, having read the books.It isn't boring. That would just signal a failure in the conception and execution of the project. The problem is that it apparently succeeds in what it sets out to do, but what it sets out to do is revolting.After the third or fourth ugly, bloodied face of a fascist police officer, I gave up and tuned out.You have to be of an age to appreciate this crap. You have to be delicate and innocent. I became far too debauched, far too many years ago.Good luck.",In the Mouth of Madness
6,BA_Harrison,In a word: Freaky.,7,29 March 2017,"When bestselling horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) disappears before the completion of his latest book, insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is called in to try and locate the missing writer. Trent's search leads him to the sleepy town of Hobb's End, the originally-presumed-fictional setting for Cane's last book, home to some really weird characters and potential portal for the 'old ones', who become more powerful with each new convert to Cane's work.I have to admit that the mind-bending 'what is reality?' narrative of In The Mouth Of Madness had me scratching my head at times, but I still enjoyed the overall experience, partly thanks to the excellent central performance from Neill, a good supporting cast that includes John Glover, David Warner and Charlton Heston, and director John Carpenter's lively direction, but largely because the film is just so damn FREAKY.Carpenter doesn't bother explaining all of the weirdness he simply lets it wash over the viewer like a bad dream, the disturbing visuals and unsettling atmosphere slowly worming their way under the viewer's skin. A kid riding a bicycle on a lonely road turns into a creepy old man, the figures in a painting slowly change position, and an old woman keeps her naked husband shackled by his ankle. There are slimy Lovecraftian creatures with thrashing tendrils, axe wielding maniacs, and an ugly cop who beats the hell out of a kid for doing graffiti. None of this makes much sense, and the ending does nothing to make matters clearer. But it sure is freaky!",In the Mouth of Madness
7,Quinoa1984,"Carpenter at his most surreal, most sickening, and, in his own devilish way, most self-deprecating",9,12 June 2007,"I think In the Mouth of Madness falls into that column of John Carpenter films that fans of his will either like a lot or wont, and I could understand the points made for the latter. It is a little hard to get into, at first, as being a very strong film based on the sharply timed shocks and paranoia of Carpenter's horror as a director as well as the ideas presented by the writer, and it does veer into going into the same wild level of deliriousness that soon enough becomes the lead character. But it's a work as well where Carpenter is testing himself, and succeeding in a carefree but controlled way, where he goes for having his cake and eating it too. He gets to throw up on the screen some grisly (and, as a possible tip of the hat to the groundbreaking effects from the Thing, a sometimes funny knock-off) special creature effects and with some masterful displays in editing through the images of abstractions into the character's subconscious, while questioning what he's doing all the time, or at least the genre he and others (notably Stephen King) make their bread and butter.It's a sort of slightly smarter pulp sci-fi/horror piece, not quite at the insane brilliance of They Live though perhaps in its more deliberate fashion a little creepier, as investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is investigating the disappearance of a severely popular horror novelist, who's books sometimes make people go a little nuts. Trent sees this first-hand from novelist Sutter Cane's agent, who comes at him wielding an axe (it's one of those pure points in the film that mixed the macabre and satire, something Craven didn't quite get at with New Nightmare). He thinks it's a hoax, and soon discovers that he may be in a (fictional?) town called Hobbs End in New Hampshire. What he finds, in typical Carpenter fashion, is describable as being a psychological flip-flopper, where Trent goes from thinking it's all a gag with it being very elaborate, to it suddenly not being, at all. Creatures (supplied wonderfully by KNB) start popping out, disgusting ones that aren't much human, and it even gets to Trett's female companion/literary liaison on the trip. Soon Cane is found in some dank cellar (Jurgen Purchnow, one of Carpenter's most chilling villains in how subtle he is), and he has a new book ready for Trett to bring to the world...This isn't quite where the film gets weird, though it's probably a little before or a little after this point, and the kind of weirdness I had been hoping to build up. Although it does get close for writer De Luca to being shaky with balancing really dark humor- however in small doses, and depending on how seriously one takes the more overt horror elements- and at the plight of Trent's mind-set in the midst of total Armageddon, Carpenter levels the playing field without missing too many beats. I kept having my mouth hang open either in a 'what the hell' mode or just in sort of plain shock. But it's an entertaining mix and match all the way for a genre fan, and Sam Neill is definitely up for the challenge of playing as well level-headed and rational Trett for the first half, then slowly but surely descending into his own subconscious state of peril- or, perhaps, Trent losing sight on what is perceived as reality or not. Only Neill could go between serious dramatic roles to films like this and Jurassic Park, where his characters' confidence as the practical pragmatist starts to waver as a descent into disaster goes further and further.What Carpenter ends on in the last section of his ""apocalypse"" trilogy isn't necessarily a closed-and-shut ending either; I sense that he wants things to be a little closer to the Thing's end, where it's all doom and gloom but there's a wink to the protagonist's state of mind. Trett's last minutes wandering the streets and going into the movie theater watching himself doesn't really spell anything conclusive, I think, which adds all the more to the fun and intrigue. He could just be still in his hospital room, still in the world that dismisses Cane as pulp-sensationalist trash, albeit successful pulp-sensationalist trash (a little relevant today, eg Dan Brown), and not among the total bat-s*** mess that the world has become while locked in his padded room. It's a question left to the viewer, and a smart one to put up in a film that has by this point thrived mostly on its own sensationalism as well, tongue-in-cheek in the guise of crazy small-town break-out scenario. As a Carpenter fan, I say, bring it on.",In the Mouth of Madness
8,BandSAboutMovies,Have you watched Sutter Cane?,10,21 August 2018,"After The Thing and Prince of Darkness, this is the third and final part of John Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy. It's a film that plays with the very notion of reality, how fictional characters perceive themselves within a narrative and issues of creation itself. It's a natural next step after Prince of Darkness, playing with many of the same themes.
The film starts with a narrative device that will be familiar to readers of H.P. Lovecraft, as Dr. Wrenn (David Warner, The Omen, From Beyond the Grave) visits a patient in a psychiatric hospital who has written all over the walls and himself, covering them with crosses.John Trent (Sam Neill, Jurassic Park) is an insurance investigator who can smell out a co like no one else. We're shown an example in the beginning, as he breaks down a scam being perpetrated by a business owner (Carpenter regular Peter Jason). Later, he meets with the owner of an insurance company (Bernie Casey, Gargoyles) who gives him a new case: investigating a claim made by Arcane Publishing that their biggest selling author, Sutter Cane, has disappeared.Just then, a man attacks them with an axe. He stops to ask Trent, ""Do you read Sutter Cane?"" The police shoot him and later, we learn that this man was Cane's agent, who was so influenced by reading his latest manuscript that he killed his entire family.Trent meets Arcand Publishing owner Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston!) who asks him to look into the disappearance with the help of Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen, Fright Night Part 2). As he begins to read Cane's books, Trent learns that his readers have been known to suffer from disorientation, memory loss and paranoia first-hand.He's also convinced that this disappearance is a publicity stunt. Yet he spends plenty of time tearing apart Cane's book covers, which form the state of New Hampshire and mark Hobbs End, the location for many of Cane's stories - which is quite like Castle Rock in Stephen King's tales.As they travel to the fictional town, Linda begins to see things and they both lose track of day and night. Once in the town, the people and landmarks are exactly as they appeared in the written word. Trent believes this is still a publicity stunt. Linda comes clean and says that the disappearance started as a stunt, but no one can find Cane. Everything happened from now on is real, she claims.For example, inside their hotel room, Trent claims there should be a black church out the window. The only problem is that he didn't read the books closely enough. While the first window he opens reveals nothing, that evil cathedral is revealed when he opens the window that faces the east.As they travel to the church, an army of black dogs emerges to defend Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow, Dune, The Keep) who sits inside. Linda confronts him, but simply being exposed to his final novel, In the Mouth of Madness, drives her insane.The fabric of reality has begun to tear asunder. A man (former pro wrestler Wilhelm von Homburg who played Viggo in Ghostbusters 2 who led an insane and demented life) tells Trent that Cane has his son and he can no longer save him. His own daughter attacked him and he could do nothing to stop her. He wishes that he could tell him more, but this is how Cane wrote him. With that sentence hanging in the ether, the man blows his brains out with a shotgun.The townspeople have become monsters and the story beats of each of Cane's tales have started to come true. Trent tries to drive away but keeps coming back to the center of town. He takes Linda with him, but she transforms into a monster. Finally, he crashes his car and wakes up inside the church. Cane explains to him that his stories ended up being true, an almost Bible for a new and more horrible world. As more of his readers began to believe in his stories, they raised a race of Ancient Ones from the before times. Again, this is well-trod ground for anyone that has read Lovecraft but not something that makes it to the screen that often.Cane explains that Trent is just one of his characters and his role is to help end humanity by delivering his final story to Arcane. He then tears his face open, sending Trent to the dimension of the monsters from beyond time and space. As he runs down a long tunnel to come back to the real world, he begs Linda to come with him. She says that since she has read the whole book, she can't.Once Trent makes it back, he destroys the story. But once he visits Arcane, he learns that Linda never existed and the final book has already been published. In fact, they are almost done making a movie. Trent is then arrested after attacking readers of the book with an axe.We come back to the asylum, where Dr. Wrenn laughs off the story and walks away to leave, only to have the attendant, Saperstein (John Glover, Gremlins 2) ask him, ""Do you read Sutter Cane?""Trent barely sleeps the night, convinced that people are fighting and dying outside the walls of his cell. He awakens to find the hospital and most of the city abandoned, with only the pages of Sutter Cane books left behind. A radio announces that mass murder and suicides are happening in every major city, with some people mutating into monsters.Finally, he wanders into a theater where In the Mouth of Madness is playing. As he watches the entire movie replay, he begins to laugh hysterically before crying. He is just another character in another story, never real in the first place.Between characters named Pickman and the closeness of Cane's titles to Lovecraft's (Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories: The Whisperer of the Dark is The Whisperer in Darkness, The Thing in the Basement is The Thing on the Doorstep and The Haunter Out of Time is almost The Haunter of the Dark or The Shadow Out of Time), this is probably the closest we'll get to a major budget Lovecraft film that isn't Re-Animator. All of the words read from Cane's books are also from Lovecraft, including parts of The Rats in the Walls and The Haunter of the Dark.Beyond that, even the town's name - Hobb's End - is a reference to a work that is close to the heart of Carpenter. It's the train station where the spaceship is found in Quartermass and the Pit. And the inscription on the church, ""Let these doors be sealed by our Lord God and let any who dare enter this unholy site be damned forever,"" are similar to the words ""Terribilis est locus iste"" at France's Rennes Le Château. In English, that should read ""This place is terrible.""Even more interesting, if you pause and read the movie poster for the movie within the movie, you'll learn that other than the three main characters, all of the actual people who worked on the movie are listed. So is the movie real? Was Cane ever real? Was Trent just a made up character? Are we real? Is reality just an illusion?",In the Mouth of Madness
9,Coventry,"Fiction...or reality? Ah, who cares! It's all nonsense",3,3 May 2004,"Supposedly Carpenter's return to the more eerie, atmospheric  and most importantly  story driven horror! Maybe so, but I don't really share the enthusiasm. Personally, I think this film is a little TOO story-driven and it ends up being an over-ambitious and confusing mess. The typically Lovecraftian themes and atmosphere don't always work and the film can actually only depend on a few powerful sequences and a fascinating performance by Sam Neill. He's a sceptical fraud investigator who's been hired to track down the missing horror author, Sutter Cane. The popularity of this writer is endless and the delay of his new book causes mass hysteria. Along with an editor, John Trent chases the writer (a spooky Jurchen Prochnow) to a quite and forgotten little town where reality and fiction completely become merged. Does the town even exist? Are the people real?? The film bears down upon an apocalyptic ending, complete with abandon streets, slaughtering and individual madness. As said before, there definitely are a few sequences that are full of potential! Like the entire opening with Neill in the asylum! That one  and a few others  are the real proof that Carpenter still is a solid horror director, only a little too sure of himself. The script is too weak for an idea like this. Written down by a completely untalented Michael De Luca (Freddy's Dead, Judge Dredd) who clearly cannot handle supernatural matters such as the parallel universe! In the Mouth of Madness received tons of great reviews and a lot of praising. Often even called Carpenter most compelling film. To me it's just a bearable waste of time with good creature effects and semi-inventive twists. John Carpenter's best work is still found in the low-budget quickies he started out with: Halloween, Assault on Precinct 13 and The Fog.",In the Mouth of Madness
10,Hey_Sweden,Reality isn't what it used to be.,8,24 March 2014,"Veteran filmmaker John Carpenter gets a lot of flak for the admittedly spotty latter half of his career, but can still take pride in this stylish bit of mind-bending, nightmarish insanity. It does lose a little something once the mystery elements are de-emphasized and the lunatic imagery takes over, but there is something here for a variety of horror fans, those who crave imaginative effects work and those who simply enjoy the idea of imagination run amok, as characters end up in a place where fantasy and reality are no longer distinguishable from each other. It also utilizes a doomsday theme, and is the final film in what the director calls his ""Apocalypse Trilogy"" (after ""The Thing"" and ""Prince of Darkness""). The visual effects are simply spectacular, with the renowned KNB group obviously having a ball coming up with assorted gore and creature gags.Sam Neill, who'd previously played the villain in Carpenters' ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"", stars here as John Trent, a cynical freelance insurance investigator who is good at what he does, and also *enjoys* what he does. He's hired by a publishing magnate, Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston), to look into the disappearance of a phenomenally successful horror author Sutter Cane (an obvious nod to a certain other famous horror writer). When he and his travelling companion, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), arrive in the small town of Hobbs End - a place that supposedly *only* exists in Canes' mind - things take an extremely bizarre turn, and poor Trent, one of those hardcore rational types who is sure there must be some logic to all of this, is taken for a dark and interesting ride.This had been written a few years previous by future big time Hollywood executive Michael De Luca, and was intended to be a derivation of concepts created by the legendary H.P. Lovecraft. Carpenter clearly saw the potential for some true horror in this script, and does a bang-up job in crafting a continuously ominous mood and plenty of weird atmosphere. As usual, his score (composed in collaboration with Jim Lang) is excellent. The ending is downright brilliant (at least, in this viewers' opinion), and getting there is just as much fun. Neill is superb in the lead; this is almost entirely his show, although the great German actor Jurgen Prochnow makes the most of his limited screen time as Cane. Some of the supporting actors - David Warner, John Glover, Bernie Casey, Peter Jason, Frances Bay - aren't seen all that much, but it's still nice to see them here.Like a lot of Carpenters' work, it just wasn't appreciated that much in its time (20 years ago now), but it's gained a fair amount of respect in the years since among horror fans.Eight out of 10.",In the Mouth of Madness
11,Doylenf,Unusual Carpenter tale is like an episode of The Twilight Zone...,6,1 September 2008,"Watching IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is similar to watching an episode of Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone""--it's that kind of tale.Obviously, the character of Sutter Cane is based on the eminently popular writer of horror stories, Stephen King, who also sets most of his novels in Maine--usually in a quaint New England town. King's name is even mentioned a couple of times by insurance inspector SAM NEILL.Neill and JULIE CARMEN go on a wild goose search for the author who seems to have disappeared just when his latest book is about to hit the best-seller lists. They both begin to believe that the author's horror books are having an effect on their reasoning when they begin to experience unexplainable happenings with horror overtones.SAM NEILL seems to relish his role as the crazed insurance man who begins to wish he never read a Sutter Cane novel--and for good reason, as the viewer will find as soon as they do reach the town where Cane is hiding out.John Carpenter delivers a subtle, chilling horror story that will keep you wondering if you too are losing a sense of what's real and what isn't. Clever plotting and good performances make this one a better than average thriller, even if the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.Nice to see CHARLTON HESTON in a small but pivotal role.",In the Mouth of Madness
12,preppy-3,John Carpenter takes on H.P. Lovecraft,8,30 March 2011,Insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) searches for a missing horror writer named Sutter Caine (Jurgen Prochnow). He thinks his disappearance is all a hoax to collect insurance. Caine's publisher Linda (Julie Carmen) goes with him. Trent slowly finds out that there is a lot more to Caine--and his writing--then people know about and events slowly get darker.This was a big bomb in 1995 and it's easy to see why. It's not your typical horror movie--it forces you to think things out for yourself. I didn't like it myself back then but I find it very interesting now. Basically this is director Carpenter taking elements from old H.P. Lovecraft stories and putting them in a modern day setting. That's a risky move because Lovecraft is very difficult to do in a movie. His descriptions of events and things are virtually impossible to visualize. Still Carpenter gives it a try.He doesn't entirely succeed but he doesn't bomb out either. The story itself is fairly easy to follow at first--then it gets stranger and darker as it goes along. There's talk of the Old Ones and (in one genuinely terrifying scene) Trent is chased down a long tunnel by the monsters. Wisely Carpenter doesn't give us a totally clear view of the monsters--just glimpses that really work. It all leads to an ending which is wide open to interpretation. That may annoy some people but I loved it. Also it IS a scary film.Acting is mostly good. Neill chews the scenery in his role but in an amusing way. Camen was just so-so in her role. Prochnow is obviously having a LOT of fun with his role. Also we see Charlton Heston and John Glover doing good jobs in their short parts. There's also a great music score by Carpenter. This is a complex and frightening horror movie that's just been dismissed as another Carpenter bomb. Worth seeing. I give it an 8.,In the Mouth of Madness
13,poolandrews,Slightly muddled H.P. Lovecraft inspired end of the world horror thriller.,6,29 December 2008,"In the Mouth of Madness starts in New York where freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by an insurance firm to check the claim of Arcane Publishing who say that their best-selling horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) has disappeared & is believed to be dead. The insurance firm feel it may all be a publicity scam & send Trent in to uncover the truth either way, after reading Cane's first five novels Trent becomes convinced that it's a con & after some inspired detective work feels he has the answer. The illustrations on the covers of Cane's books when pieced together form a map leading to the town of Hobb's End which is where all of Cane's novels are set. Trent is certain that is where Cane is & drives out there to prove it, however the fiction of cane's books & reality blur into one another as the terrifying things in the novels begin to happen for real including the end of the world & reality as we know it...Directed by John Carpenter who apparently calls this his third film in his self titled Apocalypse Trilogy after The Thing (1982) & Prince of Darkness (1987) & while I liked a lot of it an equal amount left me rather frustrated & unsatisfied, the potential for something special was here for sure but it doesn't quite work for several reasons. The script by Michael De Luca (who at the time was President of Production at New Line the company that produced In the Mouth of Madness) is very H.P. Lovecraft in it's style, ideas about evil forces from beyond reality, the end of the world apocalypse as it's engulfed by slimy monsters from beyond, all the Lovecraft references & the fact the majority of the story is narrated by a patient in a mental institute also comes straight from a Lovecraft novel. The first thirty odd minutes is rather good as the mystery surrounding Sutter Cane is explored & once the action shifts to Hobb's End itself the films gets weirder & weirder as fantasy & reality mix & lots of slimy monsters pop up all over the place. The twist that a very rational cynical man such as Trent is merely a work of fiction made up by Cane to bring about the end of the world is reasonable if a little uninspired while the final twist in which Trent goes into a cinema to watch the film we have just seen made no sense to me at all & ended things on a bit of a downer. The character's are alright although Linda Styles is a bit useless. The plot is interesting for sure, it's something different & tries to be mysterious, scary, gross & surprising & it almost succeeds but several loose ends & a plot that fizzles out as the film progresses stop it from being classic Carpenter in my humble opinion.Quite a lot of fantasy horror from the 80's & 90's did the whole blurring of reality & fiction & specifically focused on books the most popular of which were probably the rather excellent I, Madman (1989) & the not so excellent The Dark Half (1993) both of which featured killers from the pages of novels coming to life. There's some really stylish Lovecraftian imagery here with a wall of slimy tentacled creatures chasing Sam Neill being one in particular that stands out. The film has a few creepy moments, there's some impressive monster & creature effects on show although there's not really any gore. There's a good atmosphere & there are definitely a couple of unsettling scenes here but they are few & far between unfortunately. The town of Hobb's End is obviously a reference to Quatermass and the Pit (1967) in which the alien spaceship is found in a subway station named Hobb's End too.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 this was another box-office failure for Carpenter who just couldn't repeat his earlier critical or financial success he had with films such as Halloween (1978) & Escape from New York (1981). Although set entirely in the US this was actually filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting varies, Sam Neill is alright but Julie Carmen as Styles is absolutely awful while veteran old timer actors David Warner & Charlton Heston have nice cameos.In the Mouth of Madness is a H.P.

You haven't read it yet.""",7,29 November 2014,"Insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by a publisher to find missing horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) before his new novel is released. Following clues hidden in the covers of Cane's books, Trent and editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) drive to a small town in New England. There they discover that Cane has unleashed a powerful evil on the world and it may be too late to stop it.Considered by many to be John Carpenter's last great movie. I'm hard-pressed to disagree with that. I think it's the last one that really feels like a Carpenter film. Fans of his will probably know what I mean. Here he crafts a number of creepy images and scary moments that are very effective. If you are a fan of his previous horror films, I think you will like this one. Sam Neill starts out a little rough but he gets better as the film progresses. His American accent is strained at times but it's never too distracting. Jurgen Prochnow is perfectly cast and brings a presence to the role of Sutter Cane that the movie depends upon. Julie Carmen is the weak link in the cast. Neither the way her part is written nor how she acts it is impressive. She has a colorless personality and I just couldn't care what happened to her. It reminds me somewhat of some of the odd performances in Prince of Darkness, which was also part of Carpenter's so-called Apocalypse Trilogy, along with this movie and The Thing. It's an entertaining movie, particularly for Carpenter fans. Not perfect and far from his best but very good nonetheless.",In the Mouth of Madness
15,view_and_review,Stephen King Lite,7,23 August 2020,"I know this was a Michael De Luca written and John Carpenter directed film, but it felt very Stephen King. I think they even recognized it as there was a Stephen King reference in the movie.John Trent (Sam Neill) is an insurance fraud investigator who's been hired to track down a missing writer. If John can find superstar writer Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow), then the insurance company can avoid a multi-million dollar payout to the publishing company run by Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston).To get a feel of where Sutter Cane may have gone, John reads Sutter's last published book, ""Hobb's End Horror."" Through some nifty and all-too-perfect detective work, John was able to figure out where Sutter had gone. He only had to then find him, but what he found was a lot more and a lot worse than what he expected.Carpenter did this movie well. The imagery was chilling and the behavior was frightening. It wasn't overly reliant on gore for scares, though there was some bloodletting. The premise was satisfying enough as were the few tastes of horror.",In the Mouth of Madness
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Far better than it's reputation,9,16 November 2015,"Sent to an insane asylum, a man recalls how his search for a reclusive horror novelist in a small town began to experience the events of his stories come to life and torment him while he struggles to maintain his sanity.This was an incredibly fun and enjoyable entry. One of the biggest pluses is that there's a completely unnerving and insanely off-the- charts creepy atmosphere here, utilizing a ton of successful tactics to creep the viewer out. The mystery over the books and the effect they have on readers is great, making excellent use of a great concept and keeping the mystery alive through some really great scenes. That the story is so strong is another big plus, as it really allows for all the stuff to happen in the first place. It's really smart and unique, which allows for the good parts to occur since it's so detailed and flexible at the same time. That creepiness here aids the action really well with even more fun once it gets to the town, as nearly everything from the repeated gag of the bicycle rider to the haunted hotel's paintings, the attacks by the kids in the alleyway chasing them off and the general air around town is creepy. Since they play-off both short-term and for the long haul as well makes them even better as the repeat showings still get the jump while the one-time gags help deepen the mystery, and plays off each set-piece for an impressive air of creepiness and suspense. There's also the way the film manages to keep the whole air of creepiness without ever showing the creatures, which this one could've done so for several different scenes, yet all we see are glimpses of humanoid, fish-like things, yet even that is debatable because the glimpses are done so fast that there's not even a completely accurate view. The gore in here really helps the film as well, and holds the film up as there wasn't too much wrong here. Among the minor flaws is the extremely confusing manner of the ending as there's hardly anything in here that makes sense. The way the plot unfolds to the rationale behind the decisions and how the film resolves itself have little to no sense of what's happening going all over the place yet nothing is told or explained and that makes what happens really hard to understand. The last flaw in here is that the film decides to hide its money shots, as it's impossible to determine what kind of creatures they are in the brief scenes they're in and all the gore is off-screen. It's not a true detriment, but it is something that does have to be overcome, and they are the only things keeping it down.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",In the Mouth of Madness
17,AaronCapenBanner,Mind-Bending Post-Modern Horror.,7,19 September 2013,"John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out...Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.",In the Mouth of Madness
18,FlashCallahan,Your books suck.....,7,3 December 2011,"Efficient and sceptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent is hired by publisher Jackson Harglow to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane might be.After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, ""Horror in Hobb's End."" There is mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a marketing strategy.John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles, to New Hampshire, seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End.While driving along in the night, Linda reaches Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town.His twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those who read his novels.Even though the film is visually spectacular, one cannot deny that the execution of the film is decidedly dodgy, and ruins the atmosphere of the whole thing.As usual, there is some stark imagery from Carpenter, particularly the scene with the Agent with the axe approaching Trent, and the boy on the bicycle, bu these are few and far between, and special effects do not make a film any better.Neill is good in his role, but there times when he hams it up too much, and in 1995, it appears he had an air of 'i'm the star of the biggest film ever' about him, which is evident in this.There are many nods to the world of Stephen King, it's almost a homage/micky take of the author and his fans.For Carpenter fans, they will appreciate hi imagery and his trademark feel to it, other will just find this as bizarre as Neill sitting in a cinema at the end, watching the best bits of the film.A strangely watchable mess.",In the Mouth of Madness
19,Aaron1375,This film is so strange and surreal...I love it!,9,10 April 2001,"This film came out in 1994 and featured Sam Neil right off his run as Dr. Grant in Jurassic Park. Suffice to say, it did not come close to the totals that the mega hit did; however, that should not be too surprising seeing as how this is a horror film. That being said, the total run at the box office was pretty underwhelming and it baffles me that this one did not do more than the paltry sum of 8.9 million. Sure, I'd love to have that much money as I could live out the rest of my days without working at a job I hate and stressing over bills, but for a movie that had a budget of 8 million that total just is not that great. To me, this was a fantastically strange film with so much freaking weird random things going on that it just clicked for me in a way that it probably did not do for most movie goers back in the day. I do have a warped imagination and I like the whole premise of the film and certain areas of the film are almost perfect to me. John Carpenter made a film that was more Lovecraftian in tone that nearly all the actual films based on Lovecraft have been and it kind of adds a dose of Stephen King in there as well. Not the type of story mind you as that is nearly all Lovecraft, but more the whole prolific horror writer angle and the part of the country this film takes place in. A strange film to be sure, but one that really works for me.The story has a man who investigates insurance claims tasked with finding a missing author. He is good at his job and is an ideal person for the job. It is almost all too perfect! Well, he nearly is killed by a man who is apparently Sutter Cane's agent (the author) and this is only the first of many strange occurrences that happen that suggest there is something more going on here than a simple insurance fraud investigation. However, John Trent (the investigator) still believes he is being set up and everything is being staged. He manages to find out the probable location of Sutter Cane in a place called Hobb's End, which also happens to be a town that Sutter Cane has written about. John and a female who is Sutter's editor try to find this town that doesn't exist on any map and soon find more strange occurrences on the trip to this place and once they arrive. The town is exactly as it has been written by Cane and soon Trent will learn that everything is how it is written! The film really has some great stuff going for it. It has supernatural elements that I really like and one of my favorite horror conventions not done enough for my tastes, a town with a very dark secret. Sam Neil is very good in this role as John Trent and probably another reason why I enjoy this film so much. He is the reason I enjoy the first and third installments of Jurassic Park the best. Only a few minor gripes to go along with the film as they could have set a couple of things up better and had a bit more exploring of the town before things really went downhill, but overall it was a very fun and fast ride! So a very good John Carpenter film, one of the last that he did that I really enjoyed. The only thing he did after this that I liked a bit was his Vampire film. This one just had so many strange and interesting elements all thrown in to make a very bizarre film that really hooked me in. I almost wish those books by Sutter Cane were real as they seem like they would be interesting, though without the whole going insane by reading them aspect to them.",In the Mouth of Madness

21,Mr-Fusion,Suitably frightening,6,21 April 2015,"""In The Mouth Of Madness"" . . . what a whacked-out thing this is; a surreal mix of macabre/detective story, steeped in Lovecraft. Does it work? Mostly, it does, although the movie started to lose me big time during the second act. All I really wanted to do was escape Hobb's End. That segment is very (verrry) '90s horror in a small town, which is not at all my thing. Is that a silly thing to gripe about? Probably, but what're you gonna do? Sam Neill does eventually return to the city and with him, the movie. We leave the dogpile of horror tropes behind and can finally get to the paranoid delusional payoff.This is Carpenter in true horror fashion, which would probably explain my lack of enthusiasm for the movie (horror tends not to be my thing). That said, it's frightening, a bit of a mind-screw, and definitely unnerving.6/10",In the Mouth of Madness
22,siderite,Carpenter does Lovecraft!,8,10 February 2015,"Carpenter is a genius of horror movies. They are not just mindless boo scares and gory torture porn, they have a story, they draw you in, they make you part of it. That is why In the Mouth of Madness is ironic, since it is about people getting drawn in someone else's story.What I didn't know, but I suspected, was that this film was inspired by H.P.Lovecraft. And if you know anything about that guy, not only was he an influential horror writer himself, kickstarting the horror genre in the 20th century, but his books and stories are almost impossible to translate to screen, as they are always introspections of people of a certain type, people that would feel really outdated and out of place in the modern world. Yet the writer does manage to bring H.P.'s grand madness to the screen, by mixing it up with a little Stephen King magic.Indeed, this is like a horror fan's dream come true: Carpenter making a movie to answer the question ""What would Stephen King write if he had Lovecraft's madness?"". The writer is Michael de Luca, who also wrote the script for Lawnmower Man, another movie about breaking the limits of reality.Now, the film is not perfect. It is a bit cheesy at times and the movie feels dated, even for 1994. The cast helps bring it to life. Even if Sam Neil is basically carrying the film by his lonesome, you can still enjoy Jurgen Prochnow, Charlton Heston and David Warner in secondary roles, as well as a kind of weakly written role for Fright Night's Julie Carmen.",In the Mouth of Madness

24,sol-kay,A World Gone Insane,7,15 April 2004,"(+SPOILERS+) "" In The Mouth of Madness"" is a movie that completely freaks out some 40 minutes into the story and never comes back to sanity again. It leaves you confused and befuddled to just what your watching. It seems like the movie ran out of a story and just slapped together a number of out-take footage to have it completed for release. John Trent, Sam Neill, is institutionalized for a serious mental breakdown at the beginning of the movie and is being interviewed by Dr. Wrenn, David Warner, in a padded cell with nothing but black crosses drawn by John with a crayon that he was given by one of the attendants.John tells his story in flashback about him being an insurance investigator that is called by the Arcane Publishing House to find it's top writer Sutter Cane, Jurgen Prochnow, a Steven King like horror/mystery writer. Cane mysteriously disappeared, just before his latest book ""In The Mouth of Madness"" was to be released. Not a Sutter Cane fan John, trying to get an idea to what makes him tick, reads a number of his books and starts to slowly freak out. He begins to see things and go nutty as the real world morphs into a Sutter Cane story with John being the main character. With John's mind being taken over by the Cane books one night he notices that, when he spread them out on his coffee table, they form some kind of jigsaw puzzle that is a map that Cane himself put on the book covers. Put together it's a map of Western New Hampshire with a cross at the town of Hobb's End a non-existent town from one of Cane's book titles. John driving with Linda Styles, Juli Carmen, an executive of Arcane Publishing to were Hobb's End is on his map. After a harrowing night on the road like magic it's daylight and their in the town of Hobb's End. It's at this point where the movie goes off the deep end and into the outer limits of reality. Interesting but somewhat disjointed film about mass-madness that keeps you guessing if the story is real or some kind of hallucination on the part of John Trent. The movie ""In The Mouth of Madness"" does keep you interested and is never really boring but does confuse you and leaves you somewhat empty in the end. I for one gave up trying to figure out what was happening when it became obvious after both John and Linda entered the town of Hobb's End. It was then that everything became so wacko where it just didn't surprise me anymore to what was happening because it made no sense at all to me or for that matter both John and Linda too. We see john insane at the beginning of the movie to being normal during the flashback scenes of what happened to put him in that padded cell to were he slowly looses his mind. As the movie moves towards it's conclusion John finally accepting his fate of his distorted sense reality. Sam Neill is very good in the movie and his top-notch acting makes the role he has believable because you can see that he realizes what he's up against and gives in to it at the end.Neill is last seen laughing his head off and popping popcorn in his mouth in an empty movie house enjoying the film on the screen that he's staring in.",In the Mouth of Madness
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Phone good, book bad.",7,6 November 2021,"'In The Mouth Of Madness (1994)' is the final part in John Carpenter's 'apocalypse' trilogy, which also includes 'The Thing (1982)' and 'Prince Of Darkness (1987)'. In each film, the potential apocalypse - and, indeed, horror - is of a very different sort. This film, which is strangely hard to get a hold of (it doesn't have a proper UK home-video release), is very Lovecraftian in nature. It's a really bleak movie, one that deals in both physical and psychological horror, and it's the sort of thing that grows on you over time. The opening immediately grabs you with an unmistakably Carpenter theme, although his signature synths have been replaced with some sick guitar shreds, and the picture then thrusts you straight into its unnerving, mind-bending, surprisingly meta story with a framing device that sees our already institutionalised protagonist recount the events that caused his current condition. It's an effective way to tell the tale. The tale itself gets increasingly weird as it goes on, with brazenly bizarre visuals and a narrative that's even stranger. It has a slightly strange pace to it, but the piece is typically propulsive and compelling throughout. It's an interesting slice of confidently crafted cinema. It's really distinct, actually. 7/10.",In the Mouth of Madness

The beginning was solid and I liked the creepy moments early on, e.g. the old man on the bicycle, but as it played out just felt like a lesser effort from Stephen King. I didn't feel tension or horror, and the psychological aspects of an author's writing becoming reality weren't all that interesting. The acting, Sam Neill included, wasn't that great in this either.

I think his only two duds were Escape from LA and Village of the Damned. But he is one of my two fave directors (David Lynch is the other) and this is one of his best movies.It may seem confusing at first but trust meit does make sense. The premise of this film fascinates me. What happens when the line between fantasy and reality disappears and creatures from fiction can exist in the real world? Wow! This makes the basis of a totally cool movie.John Carpenter always used 2.35:1 photography and in this film we get a screen filled with creepy imagery and cool locations. The film was shot entirely in Canada in 1993 and was released in 1995. It is set basically in the city and in the fictional town of Hobbs End. When I say that Hobbs End is fictional I really mean it. In the film the town does not exist but Sam Neill ends up there. Some dark magick/logic at work methinks.This is definitely a horror film for the thinking audience.

29,tabuno,Probably lost some of its originality and polish,7,28 January 2019,"Written twelve years after his science fiction horror remake of The Thing, John Carpenter presented in living color a facsimile of an extended Twilight Zone episode as a full-length motion picture. What's interesting about this movie is that the core plot outline captures a solid conceptual experience like the classic black and white Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and even offers an expansive storyline that flows over the ending scenes better than that of his monster movie The Thing (1982). The weakness of this movie occurs either with a limited film budget or the now aging special effects where some of the set designs and visuals look artificial by today's current standards. The overall directorial story is less polished and more theatrical than today's high end quality horror films that offer more in the way of authenticity and a sort of naturalism of The Blair Witch Project (1999) along with a more crisp, sharper photography as in A Quiet Place (2018) or Split (2016). Nevertheless, In the Mouth of Madness is still able to captivate and retain a holistic completeness and eeriness that maintains its integrity even with the passage of time. Over the decades the film has probably lost some of its originality and polish, but some of the themes and creative approaches to depicting this horror movie come through on the screen quite well since its original release.",In the Mouth of Madness

Although reading today is something that has fallen into disuse for many people, there is still a wide swath of readers eager for a good story. The pessimism that emanates from the film can also reflect, largely, the concerns we have for the future of the world around us, which is full of problems that we cannot solve because there is always someone who has no interest in it because its to profit from the problem (environmental, humanitarian and other issues).The film features the excellent participation of Sam Neill, who is perfect for the character he plays.

37,Anonymous_Maxine,A huge success from John Carpenter!,9,15 January 2003,"In the Mouth of Madness is one of those horror movies that blurs the line between reality and fantasy in order to create a horror film that creeps more than it shocks. There are several instances in the film where sudden shocks are delivered by things jumping onscreen with a nice shrieking sound, but these are really only there because what horror movie doesn't have these? That's a horror movie staple, but the film as a whole presents plenty of creepy and spooky stuff that goes beyond simply a lot of cheesy scares. In a lot of ways, In the Mouth of Madness is a situational horror film, which throws its characters into situations that are just horribly creepy.
(spoilers) When John (Sam Niell) and Linda (Julie Carmen) are driving down a country road late at night on their way to the theoretically fictional town Hobb's End, they pass a young kid (who you will probably not recognize as a young Hayden Christensen) riding a bicycle down the middle of the street with no lights. John is asleep when this happens, and then a few seconds later they pass an old man also riding a bike down the middle of the street, this time in the opposite direction and stone-faced forward like a zombie. Linda grows concerned at this point, obviously wondering what the hell is going on, and then the next thing you know the same old man is in front of them and she hits him.So far, the movie seems to be just paying homage to Stephen King, from which it borrows heavily (what with the Children of the Corn sequence that this is), but there is something creepy about being in a strange place in the dark and suddenly seeing a bicyclist outside in the blackness, riding merrily along. The problem, however, is that the movie presents even the most creepy scenes like this, but then turns right around and trips over itself. After they run down the old man, John is obviously jolted out of sleep, they go back to see if the man's dead, and after he tells them that he's trapped and he won't let him out, he gets right up, gets on his bike, and continues on his way. This all fits with the situation and the movie's plot, but then we see John and Linda get back into the car, and not only does John not even offer to drive since Linda just ran someone down, but he gets back in the passenger seat and goes right back to sleep! What the hell!The best scenes in the movie are the ones that deal with stuff from the novels of Sutter Cane (Stephen King Sutter Cane Stephen King Sutter Cane  get it?) and the way that they seem to drive people insane. The man with the axe slowly crossing a crowded street to John and his boss sitting in a café, the later revelation that that man was Cane's agent, the painting in the hotel where they stay in Hobb's End, the way John kept coming right back to the crowded street of zombies when he was trying to leave Hobb's End, etc. The movie succeeds wonderfully with this creepy stuff, but trips a little when it goes too far, as it did with some more graphic parts like that goofy pulsating door in Cane's office in the church and, more than anything else in the film, the ridiculous monster that the little old lady in the hotel turned into whenever she was spending quality time with her husband.
But on the whole, In the Mouth of Madness sits comfortably within the top 5% or 10% of horror films, even the ending was satisfactory. I have a strange fascination with movies that present insanity this way, first from the point of view of the supposedly insane person, and eventually from the point of view of reality. In Dreams also did this really well. When John walks into the theater with his popcorn (but no soda, how can you possibly eat popcorn and not have soda? The guy's definitely insane!) and watches the movie that was made out of Cane's new book, he sees himself in the movie doing what we've seen him do throughout this movie, `This is reality,' `I'm not insane,' etc. Everything that he did that was a little nuts throughout the entire movie is edited together, and John sits there watching fascinated like a child and then slowly goes off into rolling laughter, and you just have to grin.Movies and books are supposed to get into your head, but only the best ones do. Sutter Cane obviously knew how to do it. I'm curious as to what Stephen King thought of this movie",In the Mouth of Madness
38,Vartiainen,Are you sure it's you who's living your life?,7,9 February 2017,"Sam Neill plays John Trent, an insurance investigator slash private eye, in this John Carpenter horror movie that sets out to expand your horizon and blur the lines between fiction and reality. Trent starts the movie as a patient in a mental institution where a doctor arrives to hear his tale. And what a tale it turns out to be. Trent was hired to investigate the disappearance of a horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), a known eccentric and mad savant.Accompanied by Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), Cane's editor, Trent travels to Hobb's End, a New Hampshire town none of them have ever heard of, except in Cane's novels. After a night of driving, they find their destination, but almost immediately dark tidings start to unravel and Trent finds himself pulled deeper and deeper into the unknown, into the realm of unnatural, of fiction and horror.In the Mouth of Madness feels very much like a Stephen King novel. The small town setting, an author and a book as plot points, the idea that the horror is an extra-dimensional threat trying to break into our reality, the somewhat meta approach the story takes. And I don't mean this in a bad way. Yet it's so weird to see Carpenter emulating King so faithfully. Their particular styles of horror have had similarities before and clearly they've both influenced one another, but this is Carpenter very much trying to tell a Stephen King style horror story. And he succeeds.More cannot really be said without spoilers. It's an enjoyable horror film with good actors, a twisty plot and a great style courtesy of one of the greatest horror director's to ever pick up a camera.",In the Mouth of Madness
39,gwnightscream,One of Carpenter's Most Underrated!,6,29 February 2012,"Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow, David Warner, John Glover and Charlton Heston star in John Carpenter's 1994 horror film. Neill (Memoirs of an Invisible Man) plays John Trent, an insurance agent who is hired by businessman, Jackson Harglow (Heston) to find missing horror author, Sutter Cane (Prochnow). He's sent with his associate, Linda Stiles (Carmen) to find Hobb's End, a town that Cane may be at that's also written in one of his books. They find it where strange things begin happening and Trent thinks it's all a setup. He realizes nothing is what it seems and that Cane's books effect it's readers. Warner (Body Bags) plays Wrenn, a doctor who tries to help Trent and Glover (Gremlins 2) plays Saperstein, a mental ward associate. I've always liked this film and think it's one of Carpenter's most underrated. Neill is great in it, the score is eerie and there's neat effects.
I recommend this.",In the Mouth of Madness
40,FiendishDramaturgy,Creepy and Atmospheric but not scary,6,4 March 2006,"This is touted as one of Carpenter's best; the epitome of his genius. I disagree. In my opinion this is a lesser work for which he may only take 1/4 of the credit. (Very loosely) Based on Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness, this work was written by DeLuca who is only marginally talented. In my opinion, the atmosphere was wrong for anything more than a horror/comedy. This work has some creepy moments, but nothing out of the nightmare that is Lovecraft. The effects are passable, but did little to generate the feeling of outright dread necessary to subscribe to the Lovecraftian style. Nor did the effects come of as anything special when dealing with the ""demons"" from the other side of the dark veil within the black tower. I mean...let's face it: they were not as well developed as the ""dark overlords"" from Howard the Duck!If you want good Carpenter I suggest Halloween 1 & 2, the Fog, or Assault on Precinct 13.It rates a 5.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",In the Mouth of Madness
41,jtindahouse,A 95 minute film that feels like double that,3,20 May 2021,"As I go back and watch a film from each year from 1980 until today, 1994 has been by far the hardest year to find a film for. I don't know if I've just seen all the good ones from that year or if it was a poor year for film. Ultimately I decided on 'In the Mouth of Madness'. It had a decent IMDb rating, a New Zealand lead actor and John Carpenter in the director's seat. What could go wrong, right? A lot apparently. This was not an enjoyable film to sit through.The story behind this movie did nothing for me. It was absurd, and not in a fun way, just in a ridiculous way. I've always had the theory - if the thing in the movie couldn't possibly happen in reality, why should I be afraid or influenced by it? There are subtle supernatural films which can sometimes work - what you don't see is always scarier than what you do. But then there's the in your face nonsense that 'In the Mouth of Madness' puts forward.The characters are incredibly bland and without an interesting story this results in the pacing being incredibly tedious. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch to see how long there was to go. I can't recommend any aspect of this film sadly. A complete misfire. 3/10.",In the Mouth of Madness
42,hellraiser7,The Doomsday Book,10,24 May 2012,"The bizarre thing sometimes about writing and reading fictional books are they are always about heightened or different realities. Each of the characters that are written and involved in the action depending on how their written feel like regular people despite whatever role their suppose to play. In a way these things are practically creating a certain existence and when we read or write these stories we suspend our disbelief because depending on how much we enjoy the story we want to almost believe it's real.This is my third favorite movie from my favorite movie director John Carpenter and it's also one of my personal favorite films in general; but also the last in his apocalypse trilogy (my favorite is ""The Thing"") It's one of those surreal horror films or just films in general you don't see often it's something that shows up on an occasional amount of years or could slip though the cracks. This isn't just a film it's an experience, because it thinks outside the box and beyond. It was also a little love letter and satire of H.P. Lovecroft stories which is cool because I'm a fan of his stories.I like it's plot which it's a bit uncannily similar to the film ""The Ninth Gate"" but that's a different story. Anyway in format it seems like a simple tracking mission mystery but what makes those kinds of plots interesting is one thing always turns into another, and this film does that but takes a more radical approach because it screws with you perception of reality in the film and pulls the rug from under you when you least expect it to.The protagonist despite unreliable is good, Insurance investigator John Trent played well by underrated actor Sam Neil. John is a cynic/realist and control freak. He loves to exercise disillusionment and his job supports it, but the thing about him is he has a low viewpoint on humanity in general probably due to the encounter of one scam artist too many in his profession. This fallible almost could make him unlikeable but what makes him likable at least to me is he always has a sense of humor, he's not afraid to satires on himself, this almost gives us a small sense of hope that he will be capable of doing what he should to combat evil. But as I've said he's an unreliable protagonist I like at times how you question this character's sanity because there are time it seems like he could be losing it, like when he cut the covers of the paperback copies of Sutter Kane. And just the simple fact these are forces that are forces beyond his control and understanding. The antagonist Sutter Kane is also great despite not being in the film that long he just has this presence where on the outside he seems like an ordinary guy (like most authors are) but you sense there is something supernatural about him, after all everything he's written has came true.I love the unsettling feeling it gives you, once again John's trademark feeling of isolation, doom and dread which help successfully add to the feeling that the world could be ending. From all the weird crap that happens in the film you just aren't sure of anything. The special effects from K and B are great, I even like the town setting which are reminiscent of the Silent Hill video game series since it always takes place in a town with supernatural activity. We see some Chtulu like creatures, some street gang that look all messed up, and one scene that always gave me the creeps was the infamous boy on a bike scene, it was creepy because it underlined the inescapable truth that we were young once but growing old. And my favorite set piece is the Black Chirch which is the spookiest church I've ever seen, with it's inverted crosses and that mural one look at it gave me the creeps. There is just so much going on in the film that it would require more than one watch to see it all. It's the philosophical conundrum of the giant floating turtle all over again only in a really twisted sense, in that story it was about how our world was really the back of a giant floating turtle; in this film it's on the possibility our world is really a story written by a writer. And of course the music as usual is great, I love the theme song it's just so cool it's one of my favorite movie themes ever.The film really gets at our perception of reality, are we really in reality or could we truly be characters from a book after all as a saying goes ""life is a story"". As well as something dark that is if we really have it in us to save humanity as a whole. The task to finding a book has became a cause to save humankind but the thing is Trent is good at dealing with only the practical problems in his profession which is pulling the curtain of fraud from fraud, here it's different because the problem is supernatural which are forces beyond his understanding which makes Trent powerless, despite Trent's efforts at trying to save humanity we discover they prove fruitless.""In the Mouth of Madness"" is a roller coaster ride into the heart and soul of darkness that you wouldn't mind riding again and read some good books.Rating: 4 stars",In the Mouth of Madness

44,Captain_Couth,The Cinema of John Carpenter: The Final Chapter in the Trilogy of the Apocalypse.,8,20 August 2005,"In the Mouth of Madness (1994) was the final chapter in the loosely linked trilogy of the Apocalypse. John Carpenter returns to the silver screen with another dark and depressing film (yay!). This tale is about the disappearance of one of the World's most sought after and best selling novelist Sutter Kane (Jurgen Prochnow). His publisher has hired a private investigator (Sam Neil) to look for the writer, Sutter Kane's latest novel is well over due. The consumers are waiting with cash in hand.After searching high and low, the investigator decides to look in to the writings of the novelist to search for clues into where he might be hiding. The clues lead to New England. Whilst searching in the North Atlantic area, he finds a strange town that's located in the middle of nowhere. What he discovers literally blows his mind. He finds Sutter Kane alright, and things that the living were never meant to see. The P.I. awakes some time later. Every thing is different. Confused, he tries to find the odd hamlet but it's like it's never existed. Weirdness and madness over comes the P.I. The World seems to have gone insane. People are going crazy over the latest Sutter Kane novel. The P.I. is also confused by the growing madness as well. He goes over the edge when he kills a Sutter Kane fanatic. Killing the fans puts the P.I. into a mental institution. But that doesn't stop his vision of the Apocalypse. While the world around him crumbles, he rots away inside a padded cell. What is going on in the P.I.'s head? Has he become part of the novel? Is he the story? Soon he hears the unspeakable beasts from the depths of hell rip through his asylum. When the carnage is over, the P.I. leaves his cell and finds a world that has been destroyed. Wandering through the remains of humanity, he hears the voices from a few survivors on the radio. After walking the streets for sometime, he stumbles across the movie version of Sutter Kane's last novel. To his horror he realizes that he's the star! Madness over comes the poor P.I. as he finally realizes the truth behind everything and just goes with it.Another classic film from John Carpenter. It's not as great as THE THING or PRINCE OF DARKNESS but it'll entertain you none the less. You'll need to bring your brain with you when you watch this movie. I recommend this final chapter of the Trilogy of the Apocalypse. You wont regret it!",In the Mouth of Madness
45,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Fantastic, underrated shocker from the master Carpenter",9,21 November 2015,"31 Days Of Horror: Day 28John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness may just be one of the director's most underrated films. It's certainly one of his most effective and intelligent. It's got a story with in a story mentality to it, a handful of really gruesome practical effects, and a story worth telling. Sam Neill plays Trent, an insurance investigator hired by a book firm to locate a missing horror author who owes them an unpublished volume. The author in question is Sutter Kane (more than a few references to Stephen King are slyly dropped), played by classic villain actor Jürgen Prochnow, who's never been eerier, given a meaty, theatrical role to play here that he fits like a glove. Trent is led to a small, deserted New England town, where the weirdness really starts. Kane has, through his horrific novels, somehow tapped into an ancient, Lovecraftian evil from the dark recesses of the space between our dimension and others, and now it wants out. It's bringing his work to slimy, squirming life and bending the rules of reality for everyone in our world. It's a super fun concept that keeps you interested the whole way through, and visually puts on quite a show as well, giving us a parade of all sorts of impressive horrors. Charlton Heston shows up as the head of the book firm, David Warner as a sceptical psychiatrist, and wiry John Glover is priceless as the world's most awkward asylum doctor. Carpenter makes a bit of a departure from simplistic, single idea driven frights and tries his hand at high concept, large scale horror. The result is a highly unsettling, really fun piece that ranks with his best.",In the Mouth of Madness
46,hu675,One of Carpenter's best works as a filmmaker.,8,11 October 2007,"Insurance Freelance Invesgator John Treat (Sam Neill) is been sent to a mental institution after murdering someone in the city of New York. John is frighten of something of the unknown, thinking it's going to get him sooner or later. A psychiatrist (David Warner) comes to meet John and asks him how he got here before he was sent to the institution. John's tale is a crazy, unlikely story of the disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). Which John's is been hired by a publisher Jackson Harglow (Oscar-Winner:Charlton Heston) and a publicist Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) to look for Cane and his latest book ""In the Mouth of Madness"". Which Cane's latest work is been delayed for months and his fans can't wait for his new book. Which some of his fans are absolutely crazy after reading his book. When John finds parts of hidden maps in the book covers of Cane's novels. John thinks that Cane is hiding somewhere in New England of a forgotten town. John and Linda are going to try to find this mysterious town. While John is a sleep in the car, while Linda is driving in a dark night. They have been brought mysteriously in the town of Hobb's End. Which this town is supposedly to be fictional, nothing more. John and Linda are been seeing strange things in this town that they are unexplainable. Cane is been living in a Gothic church. The two of them are seeing bizarre things that they are not possible. All of the things, they are seeing are based on the previous works of Cane. John and Linda are a strange world that is living somewhere between reality and fiction. Which it seems there's no escape inside of the world of Cane.Directed by John Carpenter (The Fog, Halloween, Memoirs of an Invisible Man) made an suspenseful, Gothic horror film with plenty of atmosphere and dark fantasy. This is Carpenter's third apocalyptic movie, which the first it was ""The Thing"" and the second was ""Prince of Darkness"". Neill gives an outstanding performance in this picture, which one of his best performances in his career. Carpenter's does one of his best work as a filmmaker, which he gives plenty of suspense and it is probably the most stylish of his movies. This mysterious horror fantasy got mixed reviews back in 1995 and it didn't find an audience of this movie. Which it could have been Carpenter's comeback film and this film wasn't well marketed as well. It was released in the early winter of 1995.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an technical commentary track by the director and cinematographer Gary B. Kibbe (Escape from L.A., Vampires, Village of the Damned ""1995""). DVD also has the original theatrical trailer and cast & crew information. I know Carpenter cut several scenes in the final cut, which i seen photos of scenes are not in the movie from different magazines. Including an different ending wasn't used in the final cut. Which involved the character of Linda and John sitting in a dark movie theater. Probably one of few flaws of Carpenter's movie from being perfect. It's not very scary as it should have been or creepy but Carpenter's makes it up by giving it plenty of atmosphere, stylish sequences and good performances by the cast.The ""famous scene"" where Cane rips himself as a piece of paper was done by George Lucas' effects company ""Industrial, Light & Magic"" is one of the highlights. Which it was originally written as a scene, where everything in the fictional was supposed to be sucked back in the latest book of Cane. But that effect was too ambitious and probably didn't have enough money of effects budget. Which the budget of the movie was $10 million (The original budget was $15 million before New Line Cinema changed it). Although that ""sucked back in the book sequence"" was supposed to be filmed but the special effects company thought it would be great if Cane ripped himself instead. Which that similar sequence was never filmed was done later back in 1995 in a different movie called same year was ""Jumanji"", where the game sucked back all the wild animals, the hunter and various poison plants back into the board game. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" asks the audiences more questions than by giving you answers. Which this keeps this movie mysterious. I felt it was an excellent movie, when i was younger. But once you are older, you could see certain flaws. But it doesn't keep from being a boring movie. I think, it's still a very good movie and i know, it has a huge cult following like many Carpenter's movies. Carpenter co-written the music score along with Jim Lang. Some familiar faces appears in Cameos. Don't miss this ambitious movie that mixes Horror, Suspense, Fantasy and Black Comedy as well. Written by Michael De Luca (Freddy's Dead:The Final Nightmare, Judge Dreed). Which De Luca and Carpenter were certainly inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Panavision.

Although he believes that the whole thing is a clever publicity stunt, the insurance investigator decides to play along, at least for the time being...""In the Mouth of Madness"" is clearly a loving homage to Lovecraft. All ingredients are present, in spades, complete with an extra-large helping of metaphysical angst : ancient beings from another dimension, unholy horrors bent on the destruction of Mankind, cursed churches, doom-laden predictions, books that cause the reader to go mad. At the same time it is also a homage to AND a spoof of the contemporary ruler of the horror genre, to wit Stephen King.

48,I_Ailurophile,An absolute masterpiece of horror,10,2 January 2020,"Let's be clear: There are many types of horror. Some horror movies want to be ultraviolent gorefests. Others are all about jump scares. Still others care little for getting visceral reactions from the audience & opt for simply telling a story with unnatural, supernatural, or paranormal elements.Then there's horror that may not be outright scary, but there are plentiful scenes and effects that are greatly unsettling. A sense of rising dread, of deepening intangible horror, as suspense builds amidst an uneasy atmosphere. This is where John Carpenter is at his best, and in a film-making career full of stunning classics, 'In the mouth of madness' is another unspeakably perfect work.Like many of Carpenter's films, it took me far too many years to finally get around to watching it. As soon as I did, it was an instant favorite--even more so than his other features, and that's saying a lot.There are no weaknesses here.The outstanding cast shines, from Sam Neill's skeptical investigator to Jürgen Prochnow's quiet malevolence; from Julie Carmen's beleaguered editor to Wilhelm von Homburg's desperate resignation.The music, another score composed by Carpenter himself (this in collaboration with Jim Lang), is one of his very best. The main theme is superb, and its introduction to the opening credits is perfect in a way that's hard to describe--there's something so very unassuming about a printing press, yet the raucous theme gives an otherwise mundane scene a sense of casual, knowing dread. The same is just as true as the same theme plays out the final scene of the film. The understated track listed as ""The book comes back"" brings a similar sense of unease to the ""montage"" preceding the finale, and honestly ranks just as high in my... er, book.If one watched 'In the mouth of madness' knowing nothing of it otherwise, the practical effects, and the creatures, would be a dead giveaway that this is a Carpenter film. I was quickly reminded of the effects in 'The thing,' and if you liked what you saw in the greatest horror movie of all time, you're going to like this, too.I could talk about the slightly hazy, dreamlike quality of the cinematography that adds to the atmosphere of the film and makes it seem ever more timeless. I could mention the small moments of humanity, in & out of character--Sam Neill's accent slipping in an early scene, Styles' startled whimper upon arrival in the town, David Warner's wry smile--that add weight to a tale of cosmic horror.But the real meat of the film is in the narrative, in the suspense and atmosphere that Carpenter builds. In 'Halloween' he gave us growing unease as ""the shape"" stalks the town; in 'The thing' he fed us paranoia and desperation as the nightmare unfolded in the outpost. For 'In the mouth of madness,' Carpenter slowly unveils a fractured, uncertain reality that's sure to give engaged viewers an existential crisis on par with that of the characters. Was any of it real? Or was all of it?There's gore, but not much--just enough to serve the story. There are no jump scares, though there are elements that are acutely unsettling and hair-raising. This is more about a horror that transcends what is immediate and physical--the terror of being unable to trust your senses, of the very nature of reality being broken in front of you. A movie that, instantly grabbing even at first blush, is more thrilling fun than genuine fright--yet like Cane's books, the more you engage with it, the more harrowing it becomes.In all of John Carpenter's body of work, the most dearly-held classics & best regarded of them hail from his highly productive decade of the 1980s, from 'The fog' to 'They live.' But in my opinion 'In the mouth of madness' easily stands shoulder to shoulder with those titans--not just for the pure quality of the film, but for the ingenuity of its storytelling. This is a treasure that is not to be missed.",In the Mouth of Madness
49,dworldeater,"""Reality is not what it used to be""",8,3 March 2016,"In The Mouth Of Madness is a very cerebral and very intense horror film from one of the genre's greats, John Carpenter. Sam Neil is John Trent, a private detective that is on a special job. He is to find its best selling horror author Sutter Cane (played with diabolical brilliance by Jurgen Prochnow) and get the remaining materials needed to release Cane's next book. The film is greatly inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft, but has many twists and turns that take place in the 95 minutes of the film. In The Mouth Of Madness is the third installment in what John Carpenter refers to as his apocalpse trilogy. The three films in question are The Thing, Prince Of Darkness and this. The end of the world theme is the only common thread between the three films. All three films have separate story lines and are all approached differently and are all brilliant in their own right. In The Mouth Of Madness is a very classy and well done horror film that could inspire some deep, existential discussions, but also delivers on madness, terror and suspense. The tone of the film is very dark and the film is creepy, unpredictable and totally intense. The music for the film was done by John Carpenter and Jim Lang. The Carpenter stuff is pretty distinct and is easy for fans(such as myself)to pick up on. The ambiance brings unease and dread(and complements the film well). Sam Neil is absolutely fantastic as the lead. I do think he is good in everything, but my favorite performances of his are in horror. Mr. Neil brings it and delivers a very complex performance from a very complex, cynical character. The support cast is equally impressive and has actors I really respect like David Warner, Bernie Casey and Charlton Heston. Julie Carmen is more than just a pretty face and her performance and chemistry with Sam Neil was excellent as well. Jurgen Prochnow brought intellect, darkness and class to author/villain Cane. In The Mouth Of Madness is a very original and well crafted horror film and in my opinion some of John Carpenter's best film work in the 90's.",In the Mouth of Madness
50,ferbs54,"""I Think, Therefore You Are""",7,26 October 2010,"In John Carpenter's ""Prince of Darkness"" (1987), Satan is revealed to be alive and well, although entombed in a canister in the basement of an L.A. church. In the director's ""They Live"" (1988), hideous aliens are shown to be living in our midst, only visible via special lenses. And in Carpenter's 1995 offering, ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" the paranoia quotient is ratcheted up yet again. Here, tentacled monstrosities from another dimension, clearly patterned on the Elder Gods of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, seek to sow insanity amongst humankind as a means of abetting their arrival. Whew! In the film, Sam Neill (truly excellent here) plays John Trent, a hard-bitten freelance insurance investigator who is hired by the Arcane publishing firm to track down a Stephen King-like author named Sutter Cane, whose books have begun to cause his readers to go mad. Trent and Cane's editor, Linda (the lovely Julie Carmen), track the missing author to a town in New Hampshire that was previously thought merely one of the author's fictional constructs, leading to one of the townspeople uttering what is perhaps the film's most famous line: ""Reality isn't what it used to be."" A seeming mashup of Lovecraft's 1936 novella ""At the Mountains of Madness"" and Jonathan Carroll's brilliant 1980 fantasy/horror novel ""The Land of Laughs"" (in which famous children's author Marshall France's fictional works strangely come to life), Carpenter's film is easily one of the more challenging in his oeuvre, and one of his eeriest. It is not a film that allows for easy analysis and explication, and will likely leave many shaking their head in bewilderment. Those with an affinity for Lovecraft's work, and the concept of malignant entities trying to reassert themselves in our world, may have an easier time of it, but even they might require a repeat viewing to help all the pieces fall into place. ""Lived any good books lately?"" the trailer for the film teasingly inquired; sometimes, it seems, reality is not only stranger than fiction...it is CAUSED by fiction! In all, some very impressive work here by screenwriter Michael De Luca and Mr. Carpenter, in a film loaded with jolts and shivers.",In the Mouth of Madness
51,ShootingShark,Every Species Can Smell Its Own Extinction,8,1 November 2012,"John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ...I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.",In the Mouth of Madness
52,truemythmedia,Enjoyable Carpenter Flick,7,1 October 2019,"I'm a casual fan of John Carpenter (""The Thing (1982)"", ""Halloween (1978)""); I've seen his bigger films, and some of his smaller ones, and for the most part, they vibe with me. ""The Thing"" is absolutely fantastic, and while I think ""Halloween"" is a bit overrated, it's still decent. This film, ""In the Mouth of Madness"" is nowhere near as good as either of those films previously, but I, personally, think it's about on par with ""Escape from New York"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"", and it's better than ""They Live"" and ""Vampires"" (and that's the extent of my Carpenter knowledge). While, quality-wise, I wouldn't say this isn't one of Carpenter's best, I actually thought the ideas in this movie were better than some of his other films. This movie feels part Lovecraft (particularly The Dunwich Horror), part Stephen King (anything that happens in the town of Derry), and part acid-trip gone wrong (ald. It's a movie that feels like you've wandered into an inescapable nightmare.",In the Mouth of Madness
53,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Take on Lovecraft by a Master of Horror,9,7 August 2019,"Now this one of the few John Carpenter horror films I had never seen. I actually don't really remember this one growing up, as this was the era where I was really getting into horror. For whatever reason, this one I had missed until now. The synopsis is an insurance investigator begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational.We start this film off with John Trent (Sam Neill). He is being escort to a cell inside of a mental institution. The doctor who admits him is Saperstein (John Glover). John doesn't go in easy though, as he attacks the guards. They do finally get him locked up. There is then another doctor who arrives to speak with John, Dr. Wrenn (David Warner). When he gets there, John had requested a black crayon and the whole room, including his face and clothes, are covered in crosses. John begins his tale of what led him there.John is actually a great insurance investigator. We actually see him as he is busting a guy for burning down a warehouse in order to collect the insurance money. John is then out to eat where Robinson (Bernie Casey) offers him a job. John declines, but is willing to take on another case. That's when they're attack by a madman with an ax. The police show up and take him out just in time.The job brings John to Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston). They're joined in their meeting by Linda Styles (Julie Carmen). They want John to see what happened to their best writer, Sutter Cane. He is supposed to have a new book coming out, but he's disappeared. John agrees to take on the job.Sutter is considered the best writer in the world. There are riots happening though, as some readers of his work seem to go mad. The man that attacked John with the ax was actually his agent. John picks up Sutter's previous novels to see if he can get a lead from them. He does discover something that makes him believe that the town of Hobb's End, which is supposed to be fictional, might actually exist. Jackson wants John and Styles to go find it and try to see if Sutter is there.This then leads them on a dark, nightmarish journey that will take them right to the name of Sutter's new novel, the mouth of madness.Having now seen this film, I'm actually quite upset that I hadn't seen it before. This film actually ticks off a lot of things I really enjoy. I should also point out here that this is adapted from an H.P. Lovecraft story, so I do really want to seek out the tale it is based off of and see what his original story actually had.What I really about this is that I love the investigation aspect of it. John is the best and he is already picking up on clues pretty quickly into this. There also becomes the aspect if there is actually free will or not. I don't want to spoil the film and this one is actually really difficult to talk about without doing that, but being that Sutter (Jürgen Prochnow) is a writer, some aspects of this film make you believe if John is really doing any of this or is he just descending into madness. I do love that Sutter is supposed to be Stephen King, even though the film says he's bigger than him. Sutter is a horror writer who lives in New Hampshire. All very close including the name.The nightmare quality to the film is great as well. It is interesting to start the film with John being escorted to a cell. He doesn't think he is crazy, but we see a lot of evidence that goes against it. I actually started to question it as well because we go back to what lead him there. When they get to Hobb's End, you don't know what is real and what's not. It gets even worse when we see some characters and things that are happening are straight from a book. Being that this is Lovecraft, there is the elder gods' angle as well which I love.I do have to say that this film is paced pretty well also. I never got bored and I really just wanted to know more about what we are seeing. A lot of films that have the investigation aspect like this usually suck me in. This one I do feel also has rewatchability. Now that I've seen it and I know what happens, I really want to watch it again to see what I might have missed. I like how it ends and the implications of this new novel from Sutter. The ending scene is absolutely amazing as well, as I finally know where the meme featuring Neill came from.This film is definitely helped out by the acting. Neill is great in this film. He has that smug arrogance about him early on. We see that slowly crumbling as he descends into madness. I think that is great and I really believe what I'm seeing. Carmen is solid as well. What is interesting about her, she is nervous from the beginning, but she's read all of Sutter's works. She believes well before John and I like that we have that duality there for a good portion. Prochnow is solid in his role as well as Warner, Glover, Casey and Heston. It was also funny to see Frances Bay in this film as well. I'd say the acting was good and definitely rounded out the film for what was needed.On to the effects of the film, which I had a smile on my face when I saw Greg Nicotero's name and KNB. With that said, the practical effects were great. I really got a feel of like The Thing, which kind of makes sense with Carpenter being the director. There are definitely some nightmare creatures and they look so real. I'd say that the blood and gore that we do get is also pretty good. The film is shot very well and really helps that feel of being a nightmare.Something that I was surprised about was the soundtrack. We did get a Metallica sounding song to kick us off which I liked. The rest of the score didn't really stand out, which is surprising for a Carpenter film. It never took me out of scenes, but I can't really recall it while writing this.Now with that said this film is one that I really ended up enjoying and glad that I could finally tick it off of my unseen films list. I really like the investigation aspect of the film as that is something I tend to do when I get interested in something. I like that there's a writer here who could be influencing his readers. The Lovecraftian angle is something I'm always a fan of as well. The pacing is solid, I never got bored and it definitely moves at a good clip. How the film ended was something I'm down for. Acting for the film was good and the effects were great. The soundtrack didn't really stand out for the most part which was surprising, but I also don't have anything negative to say about it. I ended up really liking this one and would definitely recommend giving it a viewing. I would say that this is a good movie overall.",In the Mouth of Madness
54,Samiam3,Wow,7,17 June 2009,"Despite being weird, incoherent, and not particularly scary, In the Mouth of Madness has a strong level of creativity to it which makes it an interesting watch if you approach it with the right mindset. The story feels like a blend of, Adam Simon's 'Brain Dead' and David Cronenberg's 'Naked Lunch'. If you love either of those films than you will worship In the Mouth of Madness. To put it quite literally, this is a crazy movie.Insurance investigator John Trent is given the task of locating famed horror author Sutton Cane who has mysteriously disappeared. Cane is famous because his novels have such a profound effect on his readers that they get mentally unstable and even violent. After flipping through some of his books one night, John finds a clue to the author's possible whereabouts. He follows the lead which takes him down a strange path. Shortly after arriving at this destination, (an unknown town New Hampshire), he slowly begins to realize that he is inside the story of Cane's new novel, entitled 'In the Mouth of Madness'. The question is it real or is it in his mind, or is it something else.There are two ways to approach this story. You can choose to hate it, see it as bad filmaking with incompetent story telling, leaving you frustrated from trying to figure out if what you see is fantasy or reality. The other way would be just to watch it with an open mind, and let the art of movie making guide you through, without questioning the messiness.If you choose the latter way, I think you'll agree with me that the movie is not great, but it intrigues you to the level that you will find strange pleasure in watching it.",In the Mouth of Madness
55,davidmvining,Insanity,8,21 September 2021,"This movie is steadily growing on me. I've seen it twice now, and I more fully appreciate the descent into total insanity that it represents. Inspired heavily by H. P. Lovecraft with some nods to Stephen King, In the Mouth of Madness is John Carpenter creating a dream in a similar vein as Argento's Suspiria or Dreyer's Vampyr. These kinds of movies are about creating an alternate reality so complete and believable while being so removed from our actual experience that the unreality becomes ultimately believable in a subtle and subconscious way. This is also Carpenter, well-experienced in the technical side of filmmaking, bringing his A-game to the production.Sutter Cane is the most successful horror author in the world, selling hundreds of millions of copies of his six books with his seventh, In the Mouth of Madness, due soon. The problem is that Cane has disappeared. In comes Sam Neill's John Trent, an insurance investigator, sent by the publishing house's insurance company to investigate the claim they made on the author's disappearance. Trent is a complete skeptic from the start, seeing right through people's bull from the start and unwilling to believe in much beyond man's ability to lie to each other. He doesn't think Cane disappeared inexplicably. He thinks that the head of the publishing firm (played by Charlton Heston) has created a publicity stunt to help them sell more books. He's willing to investigate if the publishing house is willing to accept the risk of him finding out that it's all a scam. He's sent, and with him the publisher sends Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), Cane's editor.Now, the first act is interesting in how it tells all this. The first scene is Trent being dragged into an insane asylum, ranting and raving about the end of the world. He's interviewed and tells his story, beginning with a scene dealing with a fraud case, and the acting seems stiff and mannered here, reminding me of William Hurt's uncomfortable (I think intentionally so) performance as the detective in Dark City who's not really a detective. I think this was an intentional choice to make ""reality"" in In the Mouth of Madness feel off. When Trent is presented with the case by his occasional employer, they are attacked in a restaurant by a madman with an axe who asks Trent the simple question of, ""Do you read Sutter Cane?"" There's a sickness to the world, a world that doesn't quite seem right to begin with, from the start.Things get more interesting when Trent buys the six books and begins reading them. Tales that Styles told him of people encountering mental issues after reading them sit in the back of his mind as he begins to have increasingly disturbing variations of the same dream of a cop beating a man in an alleyway with the cop transforming from a man to some kind of deteriorating monster.Trent and Styles take a car to New Hampshire, following clues found on the covers of Cane's books, to look for a town on no map, and the trip is this weirdly ethereal journey out of reality and into the world of Hobb's End. Repeated images of a boy riding a bicycle, later shown as an old man still riding, greet them. Trent falls asleep, Styles drives as the lines on the road disappear in the middle of the night, and she's suddenly over a covered bridge and into Hobb's End, the town of Cane's novels, a place that shouldn't be real.The time in Hobb's End is a bit of a meandering bit of business in terms of strict storytelling, but it never lets up this increasing sense of unease. We kind of reset once the two characters enter Hobb's End. Night instantly turns to day, and everything looks happy and cheerful, but no one's around. There's definitely something wrong. They go to the hotel and check in, finally meeting the old woman who runs the place who also ends up being a character from Cane's books. In the books, she tortures and murders her husband, but she seems like such a nice little old lady that we, and Trent, have a hard time believe that she could do much of anything. But there's definitely something going on, and it becomes obvious when they travel to the church at the center of town and see Cane. He holds a child hostage against the force of townspeople who rush the place and try to free the boy, but can any of this be real?Through it all, Trent maintains his insistence that everything he sees is some kind of publicity stunt designed to get him to run to the newspaper to spread the story of Sutter Cane's secret town and the evils that lay beneath it, but as things gets weirder, his efforts to explain it all away become increasingly inward justifications for his own beliefs. His reality is breaking down around him.The final third of the film is Trent escaping from Hobb's End and trying to make sense of the deteriorating world around him. Cane gives him the manuscript for In the Mouth of Madness that he must give to the publisher so that belief in Cane's world will increase and open up the portal for the Old Ones, hideous beyond description monsters from another dimension that we only see in the edges of frame, chasing Trent out of Hobb's End and back into the real world. What follows is the complete destruction of society, supposedly wrought by the insanity hiding in the book. Trent goes further down the track as well, eventually turning into an axe murderer himself, the event that leads him to the insane asylum at the beginning of the film.The terror at the heart of In the Mouth of Madness is the idea that everything we see is wrong, and that the reality we deny ourselves is more horrible than we can even imagine. It's the sort of terror that H. P. Lovecraft was well known for, and it only ever seemed to work in print. The terror of the unknown, resolving to solid writing around the indescribable is one thing, actually having to use image is something else. Carpenter, as well as the film's writer Michael de Luca (also executive producer and head of New Line Cinema at the time), find ways to make this sort of horror real in the visual space as well. It's the application of the inexplicable, like the image of Sutter Cane whom we have known as a real person, suddenly tearing at his face like a page of a book revealing terror beneath it. It so betrays the laws of reality as we know it, but the world created around it has been so convincing and removed from our own experience at the same time that it becomes both believable and awful.Anchoring all of this is Neill as Trent, and he's fantastic. The steady degradation of his mental state is precisely played out by Neill, going from collected to completely embracing his own insanity. Jürgen Prochnow is Sutter Cane in complete control of his own madness. Julie Carmen as Styles is a bit of a weak link in a part that doesn't seem to go as far as it should, but it's great to see Charlton Heston in the small role as the publisher, creating pure gravitas with every line.There's so much to admire in In the Mouth of Madness, but it's also easy to see why it might have rubbed people the wrong way upon its original release. It does have a traditional three act structure, but that familiarity is undermined by the absolute ruthlessness that Carpenter takes Trent into complete insanity. There's something really special at the heart of this film, and it just keeps growing on me with every viewing.",In the Mouth of Madness
56,ctomvelu1,Very scary,8,2 November 2009,"Before Sam Neil went off his rocker in EVENT HORIZON, he lost his marbles in John Carpenter's hallucinatory IN THE MOUTH.

His journey takes him to a small town where he finds the writer working on his next novel, which will bring an end to the world. Problem is, the town in which the author is working may not be real. And there are demons waiting on the other side of every door. Veyr Lovecraftian. Jurgen Prochnow plays the missing author and Julie Carmen is his editor. Special effects are pretty good for 1994, and Neil does a terrific job playing an agnostic who will soon learn to worship a most unusual sort of deity.

57,justin-fencsak,Underrated gem from the master of horror....,8,22 January 2018,"When it was first released , ""In the Mouth of Madness"" did so-so business at the box office yet found new life on home video and became a cult classic among John Carpenter's die hard fans. Having seen this movie for the first time on DVD via Netflix after seeing a commercial for it on a vhs, I like this movie. It's about a quest for a missing horror author named Sutter Cane (played by Jurgen Prochnow of Das Boot fame) by John Trent (Sam Neill). The ending of this movie has the detective having a good time at the premiere of the film based on the book of the same name and he's the only one left laughing!!! The quality of the DVD is pretty good (back when New Line used LaserPacific to master their films) and the extras include commentary from John Carpenter as well as the film's trailer which can be seen easily on Youtube. I might as well buy the Shout Factory bluray sooner than later....",In the Mouth of Madness
58,rivertam26,A modern horror classic,9,1 March 2020,"This may be my favorite Carpenter movie besides Halloween of course. His Lovecraftian, Stephen King inspired tale of monsters and madness is terrifying and trippy. Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) stars as an insurance investigator looking for the missing author named Sutter Cane whose horror book series is driving people absolutely mad. While searching he accidentally stumbles upon the fictional town from his novels where the horrors seem to exist. The movie is unique in its premise and inspired in its execution. The movie works on many levels from its complex creature design to it's trippy rollout. Neil is fantastic in the lead and the perfect actor to take the audience along for his wild, scary ride. Although not initially successful critically or financially the film has since developed a deserved cult following and a reexamination by critics with justly successful results. Carpenter masterfully mixes his inspirations into a terror fueled apocalyptic nightmare. It's truly a modern horror classic.",In the Mouth of Madness

I came across a bluray copy of this at a thrift store for a couple bucks and snagged it solely for Carpenter's name on the front. I'd never heard of the film itself... and after watching it, that sort of ticked me off. Thankfully it does seem to be getting more attention these days.A must-watch for any horror fan at any time of year, especially if they read Sutter Crane...Also, what a unique soundtrack! Highly underrated from all angles.",In the Mouth of Madness
60,blott2319-1,Well-made horror for those who like that kind of thing,4,23 August 2021,"In the Mouth of Madness is built around a type of supernatural horror that I don't find all that engaging. This kind of inescapable evil that doesn't adhere to any logical rules is not only unpleasant to me, but kind of boring to watch. However, the one saving grace is the fact that I have an affinity for movies where they leave you questioning a character's sanity and grasp on reality. I enjoyed the fact that for a portion of this film we were meant to question whether the events we were watching were reality or a vision brought on by some psychotic break in the main character's mind. It had a gradual build for a while that was good, but eventually they tipped their hand too dramatically. I suppose a liberal translation of the movie would allow you to say that all of the events in the film were only within his mind, but I don't really think that was the writer or director's intention.As with many John Carpenter films they did a decent job with the gore effects. This movie didn't rely too heavily on the crummy CGI of the early 1990s, and instead utilized great makeup and costume work to make the disgusting things. I also can tip my hat to Carpenter for the fact that he doesn't rely too heavily on cheap jump scares, and instead creates a haunting atmosphere to generate a mood of horror. However, while I appreciate the method, I struggle with the end result simply because this isn't my type of movie. I don't particularly like creepy and gory films, and I'm bored when they are built on a ghostly/demonic evil. In the Mouth of Madness is certainly far from one of my least-favorite horror films, because it has some key components that I actually like and appreciate, but it's also not a movie I'd want to watch again.",In the Mouth of Madness
61,thekarmicnomad,Assaults your mind not your giblets.,8,24 June 2011,"I found this film terrifying. Sure there is no man in a stripy jumper coming to 'stab you up' and no one is tied to a chair and worked on with an angle grinder.This film makes excellent use of those iconic every day objects that become scary in the correct context. (E.G Clowns, mannequins, Victorian prams or a child's ball bouncing down a stair case.) People who have seen this will know what I mean when I say the word bicycle.Rather than physical peril this film uses assaults on your grasp of reality. mine obviously isn't that great as I find this movie petrifying.The production of the film isn't great and there are more exciting films out there. But if you have some imagination, are a little romantic and like being scared without having to sit through some poor soul forced to spectate live at their own autopsy, then this deserves every one of its eight stars.",In the Mouth of Madness
62,ODDBear,"2/3 brilliant, final third not so brilliant",8,24 January 2006,"It's hard to go deeply into the story of In the Mouth of Madness without spoiling it. It's best to know absolutely nothing at all. That was my experience with this film and I was completely blown away. The story is very original and inventive and also has a good critique about the influences of the horror franchise.The first 2/3 of the film are masterful, the old John Carpenter seems to have returned at full force. Effortlessly creating a creepy atmosphere, astounding visuals, some gross-out horror combined with a Chandleresque detective mystery, In the Mouth of Madness seems to be competing for the title of Carpenter's best ever film. But the final third is a letdown, the conclusion not satisfactory and the terribly slow pacing kills the momentum so memorably established before.Still, overall this is one effective horror film made by a master filmmaker. Although it misses the bull's eye, it ranks as the best of Carpenter's later works. He has a good cast to work with here; Sam Neill is terrific in the lead, Jurgen Prochnow is creepy and it's fun to see Charlton Heston in a small role.For horror fans and Carpenter disciples this film is a must see.",In the Mouth of Madness
63,phubbs,In the Mouth of Madness,6,16 November 2014,"Now this is your complete John Carpenter experience right here, the perfect type of film for his crazy ass imagination. Everything Carpenter made prior to this has elements all rolled in resulting in classic Carpenter horror mixed with body shock mutations.The plot is creepy as it is surreal. Sam Neill is hired to find a missing horror writer in a small sleepy leafy US town, boy does Carpenter love small US towns. He must find Sutter Cane and retrieve his final novel for publishing. Sounds simple eh? well think again.When I first saw this film it creeped me out a lot, these days it doesn't have the same kind of punch but its still solid. Carpenter goes into overdrive here with lots of trademark icky effects and monsters, most of which look like ideas from 'The Thing'. As usual effects are created with models and puppets which do now look a bit hokey but plenty of makeup and prosthetics and good use of suggestion.The whole film is extremely surreal and plays out like a nightmare, in fact the whole point is you don't know if it is a nightmare or reality. Pretty much anything goes really as Sam Neill goes nuts trying to get out of Hobb's End and destroy the final evil horror manuscript. This surrealist approach does work and offers up plenty of weirdness which does equal some nice eerie moments, the ghostly boy cycling along the dark deserted highway at night being a good one.The start of the film is definitely better than the second half and ending. The film is much more creepy as Neill and his female sidekick leave for and arrive at Hobb's End. After Neill gets what he needs and we return to reality the film slightly loses its mysterious spooky essence, the final sequence is an interesting twist to make you think.Basically a descent into madness for Neill's character, but we're not even sure if he is a real person or not, could it all be part of the horror novel itself?. Its left to your own thoughts really which is cool but annoying also, I like to know what happens period.If your a Carpenter fan then this will appeal with tentacled monster puppetry, creepy kids running about, satanic references and all set within a Michael Myers type American pie town. Just don't expect too many final answers regarding characters and plot.6/10",In the Mouth of Madness
64,jluis1984,An underrated jewel,8,3 November 2006,"After the box-office failure of ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" in 1992 forced him to work in TV (with the movie ""Body Bags""), director John Carpenter returned to his roots in the horror genre and began working in what would be his return to the big screen with the 1995 horror film, ""In the Mouth of Madness"", a movie that would become the third and final part of his Apocalypse Trilogy (an unrelated series of horror films started with ""The Thing"" and followed by ""Prince of Darkness""). Together with writer Michael De Luca, Carpenter crafted a film that pays honest tribute to the genre's original root: the written word.In the film, Sam Neill plays John Trent, a freelance insurance investigator hired to find out if the disappearance of horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) is part of a complicated marketing plan, as he is the most popular writer at the moment. However, it seems that Cane has really disappeared, as not even his publishers know where he is. Together with Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), Trent will attempt to find out where Cane is, but will discover that the famed horror writer has a deep dark secret hidden in the apparently not so fictional town of ""Hobb's End"".Inspired by legendary horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, De Luca's story is a powerful ride to the dark side where the line of fiction and reality disappear. Themes such as the duality of reality and fantasy and the concepts of God and free will are carried through the film's remarkably well-done script, becoming one of the most interesting, intelligent and insightful horror stories ever put on film. As a tribute to Lovecraft, De Luca captures that atmosphere of dread and madness that was so characteristic of Lovecraft's works and that no film adaptation of his works has managed to capture.A fitting return to form, ""In the Mouth of Madness"" is again John Carpenter at his best, giving form to De Luca's imaginative script with amazing talent and an effective care for the story not seen since ""The Thing"". While the plot is clearly inspired on the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Carpenter completed the ""tribute"" by adding countless of references to Stephen King and Nigel Kneale (his own favorite writer), making ""In the Mouth of Madness"" a homage to writers of horror fiction. With great skill, Carpenter crafts a film that is never boring nor tiresome, and that even manages to transmit the feeling one would get by reading a book.Sam Neill delivers an excellent performance as John Trent, who incredulous of Cane's talent, enters the unknown and discovers the source of Cane's popularity. It is a very natural and believable performance that can give the chills as Neill makes his character to be so easy to be identified with. Jürgen Prochnow and Julie Carmen deliver both excellent performances too, although their characters receive few screen time (even for important supporting roles) as it is truly Neill who carries the film becoming the focus of the story.""In the Mouth of Madness"" is a haunting horror film that is both intelligent and effective thanks to Carpenter's expertise as director, and more than 10 years after is release it's hard to see why it failed at the box-office. While it's not a perfect film, it's a lot better than the average, and while it's true that it seems to lose some steam in the last third, the ending is really one of the best in horror history. Despite some quibbles with the special effects (as I think that Carpenter shows a lot more than what was needed), the film is overall a very well-done film that deserved a better reception in its day.With an excellent cast and a superb story, ""In the Mouth of Madness"" ends up as a really inventive story that proves that horror in film can deliver the same creative as it has in literature. An intelligent and twisted tale of horror, this homage to horror fiction makes a really great film. To most people, the name John Carpenter is (and will always be) related to the ""Halloween"" franchise, but personally, I find ""The Thing"" and this film as the best works of his career. 9/10",In the Mouth of Madness
65,The_Movie_Cat,A film of two halves,3,22 February 2000,"I call this a film of two halves as I fell asleep halfway through watching it and had to restart the tape when I woke up. Not many films have made me fall asleep and I wouldn't use that as a recommendation.I was quite incensed by the high votes attributed to this one (at date of writing the film has received a reasonably high 6.3) and surmise that this is because of the nature of the film. Horror/Carpenter fans will form a huge percentage of the audience, fans of neither will not see it therefore won't get to vote.I was looking forward to seeing this film, as the tale of a man who loses his sanity and becomes mentally enmeshed in a work of fiction is a strong and original idea. When the film was first released I read a review that claimed the film had ""no bearing in reality"". Rather a strange thing to say about a film that covers monsters, deities and insanity, but watching this movie you can see what he meant. None of the characters, even Sam Neill's lead, have any sense of depth or purpose. We never get to know or particularly like the characters, so we cannot empathise with any perils they may encounter. Maybe Neill lacks the necessary depth to pull off such a role - when I see him laughing maniacally I remember how much better Antony Perkins did it in Le Procès - but even strong actors, such as Charlton Heston (who plays a publishing manager with nothing to do, and not, unfortunately, someone who drops to his knees at the sight of the Statue of Liberty, damning everyone to Hell) fail to make this work.Music is important to set a tone in film. Musical snobbery is not an issue. The Ink Spots set off the Shawshank Redemption's pleasingly pedestrian pace, but here we have a ""psychological"" horror that is bookended by heavy metal. I have nothing against the genre, but it does not work for film, or at least this type of film. But then so many things do not work.Neill tracks down best-selling author ""Sutter Cane"", a man whom, we are told, is brilliant with words and description. Maybe they should have let him write the script. For the whole movie is populated by mindless gore, monsters with gnashing teeth, women with heads on backwards, walking spider-like in a bizarre mish-mash of Death Becomes Her and The Exorcist. Most importantly, it just isn't scary. Extreme close-ups and over-emphasised reactions with buckets of silly monsters and blood hurled at the screen. This could have been Carpenter's `Jacob's Ladder'. Instead it insults its audience and doesn't even compare to the worst of the `Halloween' sequels.Thankfully this film was the first part of a horror double-bill that included the satirical zombie shoot-em-up that is `Dawn of the Dead', so my evening wasn't a complete waste of time. Lastly, I've noticed that Sutter Cane's name is a malapropism of `Cutter Sane'. Coincidence?",In the Mouth of Madness
66,rzajac,Your cup o' tea?,6,17 April 2018,"Carpenter really does cut an interesting figure wrt to the tone he explores in his work. I've enjoyed some of his work, like ""The Thing"" and ""They Live"". They're cozy blends of high-concept, decent writing, clever pacing, and fine production.""Mouth"" is another thing. To my tastes, it sorta regresses to what I guess they call ""gothic horror""; general creepiness, incessantly stinging, monsters, slime... just the interminable presentation of the vile and impending-ly violent.Well... that's not my cup of tea. I never found that kind of stuff compelling. Carpenter obviously exerts himself mightily to make it so--and that's impressive. So I don't fault the flick by as many stars as I might have.If you go for this stuff, it may be a cut above the usual ""horror"" fare out there.Whatever the case may be, I hope the foregoing clues you in on the kind of flick ""Mouth"" is.",In the Mouth of Madness
67,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,This is no dream! This is really happening!,8,22 November 2007,"John Carpenter's horror movies have almost always avoided gore in favor of the implication of it. Films like ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog"" obviously have some horrific acts of violence occurring in them, yet Carpenter only hints at it. It is around for just a second so that you know well what happened, but didn't quite get the best look at it. I always thought that it was a great technique as I have always enjoyed the horror films that raise the hair on the back of my neck and not the ones that make me cringe from seeing acts of dismemberment. Even in gory films like ""The Thing"" Carpenter never sacrifices atmosphere or tension, but develops it into something very palpable that really begins to raise those hairs on the back of your neck.""In the Mouth of Madness"" is no exception. There is virtually no on-screen gore, just a few hints here and there. Not too many uses of the ""jump scare"" that has unfortunately become a horror genre staple now. There is, on the other hand, a genuine surreal atmosphere that inexorably becomes more and more nightmare-like. I think what today's audience fails to do is to place themselves in the position of the protagonist. Today people simply like to watch - reality TV, big loud action flicks, and increasingly gory horror films to name a few examples. They want to see someone in danger, they want to see someone get diced and they want to see that hideous demon that does the dicing of a preferably big breasted victim with as little clothes on as possible. Sheer terror simply cannot be manifested with such callous and cheaply sensationalist techniques. A good ""jump"" or a temporary increase in adrenaline, for sure, but terror? No. With ""In the Mouth of Madness"" John Carpenter, slowly but surely, takes his audience from a normal everyday start in the life of his protagonist to a reality bending nightmare conclusion of the first order.Obviously produced on a limited budget and with virtually no special effects it is easily seen why such a film would be ignored by the crazed audiences of today. There is a lot to think about after the credits roll and the film easily invites second viewings to see things you've missed. --- 8/10Rated R for violent content/terror.

68,Maziun,"Lived any good books , lately ?",7,1 November 2013,"This is probably the last good movie of John Carpenter . It's a horror movie that has more plot than most movies of this genre , since it plays with the ""what is reality ?"" idea. The script is quite complex and serious , yet never takes itself too seriously. I loved the references to H.P. Lovecraft stories , Stephen King and even Carpenter himself. Once again Carpenter composed and played all the music by himself and once again the music is great. The ending is one of the greatest I have ever seen . Simple , but very effective.The cast is good with Sam Neill , Julie Carmen , Jurgen Prochnow , Charlton Heston , John Glover and Bernie Casey. Neill proves he's a better actor than most of the audience thinks , while Carmen gives a performance full of confidence and charisma.The only problem I have with this movie is that it isn't scary for me. Carpenter tries to scare the viewer , but in too Hollywood-like way (something suddenly appears or flashy light) , too plastic. Maybe it's because the special effects are dated (funny thing – I don't have that problem while watching many 80's horror movies). There is something lacking about his direction , that magic touch that would made me forget that this is just a movie . When I watch ""Hellraiser"" or ""From beyond"" I have goose bumps all over my body – I miss that feeling here.The movie holds good on repeated viewings . I'm not necessary a fan of horror movies , yet I have this one in my collection. I really like it. If you're a fan of the genre you should give this movie one star more. I give it 7/10.",In the Mouth of Madness
69,Libretio,Lesser entry in the Carpenter canon,2,21 February 2000,"IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Stereo SR / DTSPointless, meandering homage to the Lovecraft mythos, replacing the virtues of a strong narrative drive with a succession of surreal set-pieces which go nowhere and add up to...well, nothing at all, really. Sam Neill (badly miscast) is the insurance investigator who's assigned to track down a world-famous horror writer who's gone missing with his latest manuscript, a (literally) mind-twisting book set in the town of Hobb's End. Having located this 'mythical' venue, Neill falls prey to a variety of monstrous visions conjured by the writer's imagination, at which point the plot becomes irrelevant and the casual viewer might just as well pack up and go home. To be fair, Carpenter still knows how to set up the kind of shocks and scares which made him famous, and he makes fascinating use of the wide Panavision frame, but the tissue-thin tale wasn't worth telling in the first place. And unless I've misconstrued the final sequence, the film concludes with an uncomfortable suggestion that Carpenter is laughing at his audience for taking such rubbish even remotely seriously. A waste of time and talent.",In the Mouth of Madness

71,ctomvelu-1,Wow,7,27 October 2008,"I haven't seen this nasty little number in years. Sam Neil, who would go on to star in an even scarier film EVENT HORIZON, three years later, here plays a buttoned-down, by-the-numbers insurance investigator hot on the trail of a missing author. His search takes him into a town wholly created by the missing author, a place where all sorts of terrible things lie in wait. The author himself is hidden away in the town, but to say more would be to give away too much. While the author is supposedly a Stephen King type, the movie itself and the horrors that await the investigator are right out of H.P. Lovecraft, being far more psychological than visceral. I have said from the day I first saw this film that it is a study in madness more than it is a straight horror film. We start out with Neil in a straitjacket, being locked away in a padded cell. The rest of the movie is told in flashback, as the fastidious insurance man slowly comes apart at the seams. The final shot of this now-completely mad man laughing hysterically is extremely unsettling. So whether the plot is about demons from another world invading ours (which is what author Jurgen Prochnow tells Neil's investigator at one point) or it is about a man descending into madness step by step, the movie is enjoyable interpreted either way, Neil is at the top of his game in this one, and is very believable as a man of the physical world who cannot deal with the thought of Hell coming to Earth. Charlon Heston has a small but significant role as the author's agent. Bernie Casey has a cameo as Neil's boss. See it, by all means. The only reason I don't give it an 8, my top number for any film, is that it is a trifle clunky in its presentation, something that has plagued all Carpenter films of more recent years. See GHOSTS OF MARS to witness an even greater degree of clunkiness. I think it is a sign of the director's advancing age. It has been a long road since HALLOWEEN, after all.",In the Mouth of Madness

Atmosphere is the key for any movie inspired by the works of the great Howard Phillips, and this one gets it! The horror is not in your face, it is eerie, subtle and ever present. It might not be always visible, but in the back of your mind you know it's there if you close your eyes..

75,ebeckstr-1,Perpetually underrated,9,14 October 2021,"In the Mouth of Madness is perpetually underrated, except by Carpenter fans and aficionados of Lovecraftian horror.This movie has something for every horror fan. Sam Neill is perfectly cast as the self assured, almost cocky, but appealing, lead protagonist. The rest of the cast is strong as well, including a surprise supporting role by Charlton Heston.The movie has a creepy, mysterious atmosphere, which dominates from the opening scene. In addition, there are some excellent creature effects, gruesome horror, Carpenter-s pitch-black sense of humor, and some beautiful composition and use of color. The production design, including the graphic design of the fictional writers book covers, and some well-chosen location shooting, are excellent. Above all, this is simply a fun horror movie.Side note: If you are someone who enjoys DVD commentaries the one on this disc with Carpenter and his cinematographer from the film, is superb. Carpenter is among the best at this sort of commentary, and this one is another of his master classes in filmmaking.",In the Mouth of Madness
76,Shattered_Wake,Genuinely scary 90s horror,8,3 September 2008,"Long before the The Signal was turning viewers mad, there was 'In the Mouth of Madness'. . . After the Stephen King-like horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) mysteriously disappears, an insurance adjuster, John Trent (Sam Neill), is hired to find him by Cane's publisher. Trent, however, discovers that Cane's written world has filtered into reality and taken hold of him. Is this fictional world actually becoming real? Or are crazed fans and Sutter himself responsible?John Carpenter is deservedly known as a true master of horror, and one of the best American filmmakers in the business (even with his many slip ups). Although 'In the Mouth of Madness' isn't among the top couple of Carpenter's best or most famous, it still borders on greatness. The story, though not as original these days as it was back then, is fantastic. Then again, my horror-writer side has always had an infatuation with flicks about the profession. 'In the Mouth of Madness,' however, goes beyond the 'writer' film, and focuses more on the seeker of the writer. De Luca's script and Carpenter's direction blend wonderfully to make a film that perfectly blurs the lines of reality and fiction (especially in the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream sequences), Sam Neill delivers his usual good performance (even though Julie Carmen was pretty bad), and the scares and thrills made for some edge-of-your-seat entertainment. I highly suggest this film for anyone looking for a genuinely scary and intriguing mystery.Final verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",In the Mouth of Madness
77,AKS-6,Scary? No. Fascinating? Yes.,5,19 November 1999,"""In the Mouth of Madness"" is not a very good movie, it's far from bad, but it lacks a very important thing for being a horror film -- it does not scare the viewer. At least not me. However, Sam Neill does a good job as a man who is trapped in a nightmare -- or is it reality? -- or is he mad? Thinking about the movie, though, I can't think of any particularly scary scenes. And I hate it when they bring in the monsters!! Monsters are not scary -- they're about as scary as that pathetic skeleton in ""Hellraiser"". Well, I shouldn't just complain because even if it's not a scary film, and even if it does get a bit ridiculous at times, it's still a *very* fascinating story. The ideas in the script are pretty brilliant and I believe that Carpenter manages to realize those ideas. The ""scary"" scenes though they are sadly a failure. Well, I quite enjoyed the film and it is (despite its flaws) the best horror film I have seen in a looong time (apart from ""The Shining"" which I saw recently). (5/10)",In the Mouth of Madness
78,edgeofreality,Hard rock psycho,7,2 May 2021,"Curious, ambitious horror which almost lost me with all it's supernatural twists and turns. It stayed in my mind though and I enjoyed the music and effects. The heroine is sexy too.",In the Mouth of Madness
79,nitzanhavoc,"Good as a Lovecraft tribute, not so good as anything else.",5,7 May 2013,"After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back.So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays ""mind twisting"" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary ""before it was cool"" (if you don't consider ""The Good Son"" and ""The Omen""). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15"" black and white TV screen. Sorry.All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.",In the Mouth of Madness
80,domino1003,Should Be Given A Second Chance,9,14 July 2005,"It's too bad that ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" didn't do so hot at the box office, but even classic films are flops. John Carpenter creates a story which leaves one wonder what exactly ""reality"" is.As the film opens, John Trent (Sam Neil)is dragged kicking and screaming into a mental asylum. But as you soon discover, he is not insane. In fact, it seems that the entire world is slowly going to hell. There are outbreaks of violence throughout the world. As Dr. Wrenn (David Warner) listens, we find out what is going on.Months before,Trent (Who is an insurance fraud investigator)nearly gets killed by a crazed man with an ax. Soon afterward, he finds out that the man that nearly killed him was the former agent of Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow), who has been missing for months. He finds this out from Cane's publisher (Charlton Heston). His editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) tells Trent that Cane's books have a weird effect on those who read the books. His latest book, ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is way overdue, and his fans are going mad, wanting the book. Trent, who thinks that the whole thing is a publicity stunt, discovers that the paperback book covers when pieced together create a map to the fictional town of Hobb's End. No side trusting the other, both Trent and Styles goes on the search for Cane.Despite the fact that there is no such town as Hobb's End, they manage to find the town. And that is where things get weird. The town totally looks like what is described in the books.And then events start to happen, just like in the novel. People are turning into mutants creatures with a thirst for violence. The reason behind this is Cane: What he writes turns into a horrifying reality. But his words on paper is creating a way for nightmarish creatures to enter our world and to end human existence.The best performance of the film is Neil. His skepticism is understandable: there is no way that our life can be controlled by anyone but himself, and cannot accept that his version of reality may indeed be wrong. But, like him, we soon have to accept that reality is never pretty.If you have never seen this film, then it is a must see. Part of what Carpenter called his ""Apocalypse Trilogy."" So, rent this along with ""The Thing"" and ""Prince of Darkness"" and have a really good scare.",In the Mouth of Madness

82,peefyn,"A celebration of horror fiction, but not that scary",6,17 September 2016,"There's references to both Stephen King and Lovecraft, but the movie itself is more a celebration of this kind of horror in general. The whole movie is about questioning one's own sanity, as the horror evoked by not knowing what is real, has been an effective trope in horror fiction for a long time. There's some slight attempts at connecting it to a philosophical level concerning subjective reality, but it never really gets all that interesting. I don't think the plot was meant to explore the limits of horror, fictional reality or anything like it, but rather to serve as a vehicle to unsettling scenes. And for that, it works alright.Sam Neil's performance is good, but Julie Carmen was not always that convincing, though it might have been on purpose. The best part of the movie is not the plot nor the actors, though, but the utter charm that Carpenter brings to most of his movies.

There were many good tense scenes. The suspense is also nicely built up and there are alot of surprises.If we talk about performances, everyone did their job nicely. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween and The Thing.This movie is too much underrated. The reason why movie didn't perfom good at box office was that it was ahead of it's time and audience failed to measure the significance of this movie.Overall, the movie is good and different for it's time.

84,buckikris,Do You Read Sutter Cane?,8,5 February 2012,"I watched this movie over the weekend and loved how it had that Twilight Zone/Stephen King feel to it. John Trent, Sam Neill, is an Insurance Investigator, who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of horror author Sutter Cane. He does some investigating of his own before taking on the assignment. He starts by reading most of Sutter Cane's novels. While reading them he thinks he knows where he might have gone. He rips up the front covers of each book and discover's it a puzzle of the state of New Hampshire and the star is Hobb's End. He goes back to Cane's publisher, Charlton Heston, and shows him and Linda Stilles this. It's a done deal, Trent takes along Linda and they are on there way to Hobb's End.Anlong their journey the both of them find and enter the strange town of Hobb's End. In Hobb's End people are turning into creatures and things are not what they seem. While there Trent discovers that Cane's disappearance was a publicity stunt; but according to Stilles he never reached his destination. This is were the movie can become confusing and where reality and fiction mix.While in Hobb's End, Trent thinks he is still apart of some stunt. As the movie continues the Twilight Zone feel comes into play. The children getting some kind of virus that turns them into creature's and it spreads to most of the adults in the town. It is up to Trent to find out what is going on, discover the truth; and find Sutter Cane before Trent cracks up.The reason why I liked this film is because it has that Stephen King vibe in it. To me it's like a story within a story, plus it has that creep factor in it from the beginning to the ending. In The Mouth of Madness is no Halloween, it's not Carpenter's best; but it's far from being his worst. It deserves an 8/10 stars, great story, but the movie is not for those under 13 due to the some violence. Kris L. CocKayne",In the Mouth of Madness
85,jcbutthead86,A Scary And Frightening Film And One Of The Best Horror Films Of The 90s. Another Carpenter Classic.,10,3 June 2013,"In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best.In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter.The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",In the Mouth of Madness

The film is hardly one of Carpenter's best, but it's entertaining and would have benefited from a different lead. Sam Neill does not pull off crazy, unless hammy over acting passes for loosing one's mind.

I don't think he really lives up to this standard since but there is still great hope that Carpenter will create more classic work.

90,Jacques98,"Possibly the best cheese-horror movie ever made, but still that: cheesy.",1,17 October 2008,"There are two types of horror fans: those that want truly original, scary, and well-done genre pieces, and those who hail the old cheese-horror movieslike A Nightmare on Elm Streetas ""classics"" and anything new as ""trash"". In the Mouth of Madness tries to have it both ways. It uses some interesting, fresh ideas while also using tired genre clichés without any constraint whatsoever.The good: In the Mouth of Madness does have an intelligent point to make about how obsessive some people are with horror fiction (movie, book, video game, it doesn't matter) that very few horror movies would ever dare go. Some of the surrealist moments are the best I've personally ever seen, and I've seen a lot. The overall plot, while not really original, is not something that is overused in the genre by any means, and is very entertaining.The bad: Cheesethe majority of this movie plays out like a bad 40s B-movie, which is sort of is. The creature effects suck, even for their time, and a lot of the acting is insanely over-the-top and just downright funny. Some of the scenes even have laugh-out-loud horror montages that you've seen in so many b-movies it's just ridicules. I couldn't even talk half of this movie seriously. The very last scene of the movie almost even seems like a punch-line.Clichésat one point in the movie a character says: ""All horror movies have the same plug. Bumps in the night, axes, people turning into monsters . . ."" and that is pretty much how the entire movie plays out. And while the movie continuously mentions Stephen King's name in passing reference, the screenwriter just doesn't seem to get it: this movie is nearly a rip-off of Stephen King's The Dark Tower books, as well as some of his short stories. It even has some near ripped-off elements of a few Dean Koontz's short stories, as well. But this movie simply isn't even half as well-done or original as wither writer's work.The ugly: I really wanted to like this movie, but the lack of originality and prevalence of cheese kept me from it. Even though this movie is worth watching, it's not worth paying money for. Just watch it on Cartoon Network whenever they play their Halloween lineup.0/10",In the Mouth of Madness
91,Darkjak007,This is reality that is reality,7,13 October 2021,"John carpenters In the mouth of madness we follow John Trent(Sam Neil) an insurance investigator who's hired by a Book publisher(Charlton Heston) to track down their client the renowned horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen prochnow). Who's gone missing just before the publication of his new book in the mouth of madness.now the publishers want Trent to either bring back Cane or their investment the final manuscript of the novel. Trent soon finds himself succumb to a series of bizarre & surreal Visions. It's understandable why somebody can find this film good or find it bad. The movie is heavy based off Lovecraftian horror. If your not familiar with that It's a more obscure otherworldly style of horror, named after the writer The theme of the movie is more centered around the concept of madness,occultism and beyond human comprehension in someways it's not supposed to make sense entirely. Unfortunately it could be for that reason why many just as back then, can't find this film very exciting or interesting because it's not really spoonfed to you and can come off as just weird. Though carpenter still manages to add a sense of self aware of his own style. To the visual of the scenery to the Practical effects of the monsters very reminiscent of when he did the thing. It's kinda on the nose that Sutter Cain is supposed to be an analogy of Stephen King. It can be seen from the book covers, to the self referencing to even the story majority of the story takes place in a small town just south of Maine. The characters are written well for the situation cabin however it does feel like most I just went to service more background filler characters honestly the only two that are really all that interesting or Sam Neill and Juergen prochnow. As stated Charlton Heston's in the movie but he doesn't really have a big of a role, kind of disappointing to have someone like him in your movie but don't really use them.",In the Mouth of Madness
92,ApolloBoy109,H.P. Lovecraft Lives through the Eyes of John Carpenter,9,5 October 2000,"No one but screenwriter Michael DeLuca and director John Carpenter has ever fully realized the beautifully, horrifying visions penned in the 1920s florid writing style of H.P. Lovecraft. The film embodies the frightening creations that Lovecraft gloried in a series of short stories, culminating in his masterpiece: The Cthulhu Mythos. The ominous prehistoric creatures, which held sway over earth prior to our existence, are at the center of most Lovecraft's tales. They are forever trying to return and take back what was once theirs. The tales revolved around individuals unlucky enough to encounter the monsters mid-plight. Carpenter and DeLuca follow in the bloodied footsteps of Lovecraft so faithfully we are given a true tour de force of the grotesque, demons from the vile pit and a slew of distorted human beings. The production brings the writer's horrific visions to full light -- Aye: there's the rub. The price of these colorful -- wild visuals expose Mr. Lovecraft's failure as a writer. That very thing makes it a true interpretation of his work but mortally wounds the film in the process.We have no narrative, no starting point at which the horror begins. Insanity without any background knowledge or a set-up is nothing more than horror for the sake of horror. The film, like H.P. Lovecraft's work, skirts answering intelligent questions. Who are the creatures? Why are they here? How did Sutter meet them? Why does Trent continue denying that something's not right -well into the madness? What is the Madness? Why is the book driving people mad? What we are given is a playful joke on a Stephen King like writer and the universe he has created. A story with in a story -- without knowing why Sutter has been seeing and writing about Trent. Why Trent was picked?Wouldn't it have been better to use H.P. instead of Sutter . H.P. was a much more colorful character than what we are given in the film. Lovecraft had many problems but his imagination will live on forever. Do not misunderstand me -- I have always enjoyed his short stories, however, were it not for a sudden interest in his work during the 70s no one today would know he ever lived. And H.P's fate? His work and his name are now being exploited by film makers. It would have been the one thing that would have truly horrified him. All in all I recommend the film for its stunning visuals and incoherent narrative -- it is, in fact, like a nightmare. Personally I have always found that the shock of horror second to the psychological horror, the creature in us all, the id of someone like Sutter Cain, Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft -- to dwell in their universes would truly scare me.One finally note: Reading a Lovecraft tale is very different than watching one. Very, very frightening.",In the Mouth of Madness

94,patriciogl10,All hail John Carpenter.,7,6 December 2019,"The master John Carpenter constructs a fascinating and imaginative tale about a highly successful novel author, Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow, of 'Das Boot' fame) who disappears and his publishing company hires ensurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) to track him down as he is being required because his latest book is a massive hit. The journey John Trent and Cane's editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) embark on serves as a test of John's sanity, given that the line is blurred between fantasy and reality, and apparently everything that occurs is happening exactly as in Cane's latest book.Sam Neill delivers a terrific performance as we watch his character go from being dismissive and skeptical to unnervingly wind up in a downward spiral of madness. It's truly captivating to watch him go in opposite directions so seamlessly and coherently.The film's frightening atmosphere will turn your viewing experience around, as it is perfectly captured and transmited to the screen which sets a somber mood that never escapes the reins of the visual experience. This also must be credited to Michael De Luca's terrifying story that John Carpenter visually translated it to the screen in such an optimal fashion.A great entry in the Master of Horror's precious filmography, you can't miss it.",In the Mouth of Madness
95,TheRedDeath30,Really Promising Idea that Doesn't Quite Find Its' Groove,7,3 September 2016,"This movie was released at a time that the horror genre was at one of its' all time lows. There was very little quality horror releasing at the time. Slashers had been declared ""uncool"" and the horror community was struggling to find the right ingredients to be successful. Look at most of the well-known horror of the era and a good deal of it were movies that were actually trying hard not to be labeled as horror, in THE SIXTH SENSE, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or SEVEN. John Carpenter is an icon of horror, but by this point his best work was a decade behind him. This was the decade that brought us GHOSTS OF MARS and VAMPIRES. While both have their strong points, they are far from the movies like HALLOWEEN and THE FOG that brought Carpenter the legendary status that he now enjoys. So, in an era where horror was trying hard to be ""serious"", Carpenter brought us a tribute to two of his favorite horror writers, King and Lovecraft.Sam Neill (from JURASSIC PARK) is top notch insurance investigator, who has an encounter in the early moments with an ax-wielding psycho. Turns out the psycho was an agent for the most popular horror writer in the world, Sutter Kane. Turns out, even more, that Kane is missing and his firm is a client of the insurance where Neill works, so naturally he is brought in to help investigate the disappearance. This leads him to a town called Hobb's End which is on no map and, in fact, may not even be real at all, as our hero's life and reality begin to unravel.The movie is, basically, a really good idea that is never developed enough to truly works, but when it does hit it hits really well. What I find appealing is the reality-warping moments. Hobb's End is an amalgam of all sorts of crazy horror ideas - shotgun toting townies, evil children, a dark church, a scary old lady, on and on. They are all plot strands from Kane's novels, come together in one crazy little town. As a big fan, myself, of both King and Lovecraft, I appreciate the token nod to their work and the idea of paying tribute to the both of them in film.That's part of where the problems develop too. King and Lovecraft's work are not that similar and trying to mingle the two doesn't truly let the flavor of either shine. King's work is most masterful when lettings its' characters shine through and develop them into sympathetic stand ins for the viewer/ reader. This movie never really lets us get to know any of the characters well enough and, certainly, not to ""like them"" in any real way. On the other hand, Lovecraft worked in cosmic mysteries, ancient evils and nebulous terrors. The movie tries to bring this in, but doesn't seem to understand what is is about Lovecraft that really worked.Part of the problem is the acting. Sam Neill is just fine. The heroine is neither a memorable enough actor to bring any flavor to the role, or attractive enough to make us forget that she's not that great an actor. The dude that played the Duke in DUNE is Sutter Kane, the horror writer, and he's completely forgettable. This needed to be the most impact-ful role in this movie, but he is not frightening or convincing. The other major issue is that the movie just feels so Nineties. As a guy show spent the last part of his teens and early twenties in that decade, I think I'm pretty versed in the Nineties. This is all the worst parts of it. Overly done production with too much sheen on it, poor practical effects, mingled by early computer imagery and too much attempt to replace the villains of Eighties horror with the ""scary themes"" horror of the Nineties (at least until SCREAM saved us).It's not a bad film and for those who haven't seen it, I would recommend giving it a go, just don't think it's one of those movies that will go on your list of repeat spins.",In the Mouth of Madness

97,willywants,An unexpected treat,8,20 February 2005,"Insurance claims expert John Trent (Sam Neill) Goes off on a search for missing horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), convinced his disappearance is a hoax. Once Trent goes looking for the missing author, he's lead to Hobb's End, a supposedly fictional New England town, to discover that something very wrong is going onand Sutter Cane is responsible. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" came as a delightful surprise to me.I rented the DVD solely because I'd been wandering the video store shelves for close to 45 minutes (I have a little too much free time) and figured I'd be kicked out so I grabbed a handful of movies. This was one of them, and let me tell you I'm sure glad I did, because this is a damn fine flick!To start, Sam Neill is excellent, as is Mr. Prochnow. The only bad performer here is Julie Carmen (Regina from Fright Night 2), who gives a wooden and thoroughly unconvincing ""when-the-hell-do-I-get-my-paycheck?"" performance. Michael De Luca's script is sharp enough to never takes itself too seriously, while at the same time it can be very scary and dark. John Carpenter's direction was top-notch. Some of the guy's recent films have beendisappointing, to say the least, but here he delivers the gore, suspense and action like a pro.The special effects are great. The boys over at KNB effects studios cook up lots of monsters, gore and slime, delivering the goods as usual. The creatures here are indeed reminiscent of Carpenter's ""The Thing"", their creative and all look very lovecraftian in design. At times the film can be extremely scary. The old trick of using darkness and shadows to convey creepiness that Carpenter's so good at are present and good as ever. ""In the mouth of madness"" pulled all the right strings and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended.8/10.Oh, and great ending.",In the Mouth of Madness
98,TheCorniestLemur,Do you read Sutter Cane?,7,6 September 2020,"This is definitely not something you should watch if you're expecting a simple narrative, it is meta, it is confusing, it'll make you paranoid...and I think it's pretty brilliant. It's something I'll never feel like I fully have a grasp on until I watch it again, but it's really well written and directed, with some really chilling concepts and effects, and even if the characters can feel a tiny bit wooden and Sam Neill has a really hard time keeping his accent down, it's amazing to me that not a lot of people talk about this as an integral part of John Carpenter's work.
So really, this is a placeholder rating until I get around to watching it again, but I'm sure it'll get even better when I do.

99,MonsterVision99,A great start that leads into a more mediocre movie.,6,26 October 2017,"I have been somewhat disappointed by Carpenter this year, ""The Fog"" was pretty good, a bit flawed, but still highly enjoyable. ""Prince of Darkness"" had some mediocre and dull parts, but had some great concepts, a good atmosphere and some good effects. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" has some of the same problems ""Prince of Darkness"" had, and much like ""Prince of Darkness"", it has many good elements that save it from being completely mediocre and elevates it.I liked this one better than ""Prince"" since it has a really good performance by Sam Neill, his character was really enjoyable to watch and you sympathize with him because of his charm, without him the film wouldn't have been as entertaining, unfortunately. I believe I liked the build up better than the action itself, once monsters start appearing and we find out more about what's happening the movie sort of becomes standard, nothing bad but nothing great either, much like ""Candyman"" this movie lacks more rules to its horror, it just feels like a bunch of random events and ghouls appearing just because.The ending is a bit inventive, predictable, but still riveting to watch. The movie actually has some creative moments and some great special effects to accompany them, but it never becomes more interesting than its premise.Overall, a good film that falls flat at moments but has some great ideas and very suspenseful scenes that save it.PD: Points extra for Robot Monster.",In the Mouth of Madness

First of all i love how it slowly starts, making us know the main character, the context on all the happenings, and giving us reasons to understand better and even fear the second act. the movie spends half an hour building an atmosphere in our heads, without imposing anything.Then the second act cames and...it's more pure carpenter. The thriller and horror are perfectly mixed and balanced, the descend into the scares either, it makes you guessing and mostly makes a terrific job on characterization, makeup and even comedic moments.again it builds piece by piece until the main part where let's say the truth is revealed. it's just feels so organic built that's amazing. This is the work of the script yes, but it's also the work of an astonishing filmmaker.the third act is great either, mostly because of the metalanguage of it all * i won't expose anything. But let's say art and craft and life are pretty much interconnected and at a certain point you don't even know what is really there or it isn't. The movie takes a bit of a surreal turn that takes a leap of faith - don't worry that's exactly what the movie wants. again, nothing is imposed here and you can believe whatever you want what i think is great.All in all is just a great carpenter movie again. I never saw a film from him and gave less than a 8. I saw parts of christine and didn't like it much, but need to see it properly. This one works as a thriller, as a horror film, as a movie within a book within a movie and it's a descent into craziness that makes you smile at the end.Why only 8 and not a 9? Good question. I believe is because it didn't touch me hugely enough to give it more. when i give a 9 or a 10 (amost never) a movie needs to touch with my emotions in a deeply way. This one i felt was a great movie, really well balanced, well acted, very well organized and gives space to the viewer to believe whatever he wants, but it missed that spark - maybe i wanted a slightly different movie. Still, if i'm justifying myself is because it's extremely close to a 9. Great film, and carpenter is an awesome director.

Especially as the viewer wonders, just as Trent wonders, if this is truly real or not. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT. STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE. Here is my take on it: Trent is actually Cane. It is the real author (Trent/Cane) who has gone insane and is living out his own works of fiction.

108,quinimdb,In the Mouth of Madness,7,25 October 2016,"""In the Mouth of Madness"" has surreal and gruesome horror, as per usual for a John Carpenter film, but what's scariest about it are the ideas it presents.The film is mostly grounded in the idea that reality is an illusion, and, despite humans grasping for order in the universe, just beneath the surface lies only inexplicable chaos, and this is uncovered through the release of a universal book. Once a skeptic, John Trent (a convincingly insane Sam Neill) slowly begins to descend into chaos and madness through a series of strange and scattered events. A group of children are used as vessels for chaos, time doesn't seem to comply, unexplained monsters appear, and Carpenter's blocking frequently suggests an isolation and alienation for Trent, looking small in the frame and sometimes completely surrounded by darkness and the unknown, which is the driving factor for fear in this film. As the film continues, it's hard to tell what is reality and what isn't, and that's kind of the point. Even when it seems Trent has snapped back into reality, it is revealed that there are only more layers of confusion, and the end of the film is brilliant in it's ultimate, meta- realization that reaches out to the viewer and leaves us feeling insecure about our own reality, and sanity, even if just for a second (although I think it would have been more effective without the music).",In the Mouth of Madness

110,shaun98,Big disappointment from Carpenter,3,31 December 2002,"Despite his loyal cult following, John Carpenter's filmmaking resume remains a most uneven one. His career began on a high note with the legendary ""Halloween"" (still regarded as his best work), and other slightly less-known but still notable thrillers such as ""The Thing,"" ""Escape From New York,"" and ""Dark Star."" However, in the past decade or so, even his fans have admitted that his recent work has been mediocre, sometimes just plain bad. His latest film, ""Ghosts of Mars,"" has served as another nail in his coffin. For many of his fans, ""In the Mouth of Madness"" was his only recent film to live up to his past success. As much as I would like to agree with that assessment, my commitment to writing honest reviews compels me to state my opinion that it is not. I truly envy those who enjoyed it--perhaps this is one of these movies that one must be on a certain wavelength in order to like. From my perspective, it was just plain boring. I was looking forwards to this one, regarded in many circles as one of the director's best films. Watching it, I had the sinking suspicion that Carpenter is simply overrated. I hope completing his filmography will give me a more balanced assessment of his work, but even with my incomplete knowledge, it is not difficult to see his creative limitations. I can't help but feel a bit cheated.The plot concerns an insurance investigator trying to locate a missing horror novelist, whose books are so popular they have begun to inspire violent behavior in his fans--a crisis that is reaching epidemic proportions. He happens upon a small town that seems to have been based directly on the author's books. It is not long before the powers of darkness make their presence known--they have been using literature as a means of carrying out their sadistic plan against mankind. While not officially adapted from any particular book, ""Mouth"" owes more than a bit to Stephen King. Making a central character a writer has been used numerous times by the real-life author (see ""Misery"" and ""The Dark Half""). I recall one reviewer saying that the town bears some resemblance to the setting of ""Needful Things."" Of course, all this is much more ambitious than the average horror movie, with some potentially interesting ideas, but the filmmakers fail to give the audience any reason why we should care about the protagonist. Sam Neill does his best, but the pace is tedious and the material is treated in a manner that is completely uninspired--it just lacks that ""spark of energy."" As an editor from the publisher, Julie Carmen is simply dreadful; her wooden performance could serve as a cure for insomnia. Charlton Heston plays the publisher, but he fares no better. As the ill-fated novelist, Jurgen Prochnow does what he can, but is nonetheless overshadowed by the boring movie he's trapped in. Finally, the ending is actually fairly interesting, but by then it's too late. The film is slickly photographed, but there are next to no chills. Perhaps ""Halloween"" was a bit drawn-out at times, yet it still displayed a life and strong directorial presence lacking in much of Carpenter's work. Even ""Prince of Darkness,"" while uneven, nonetheless had some genuinely creepy moments. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" is simply a turkey that disappointed me in every respect.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",In the Mouth of Madness

P. Lovecaft (In The Mouth of Madness even sounds a lot like At The Mountains of Madness) but saddly some of the the special effects are really bad, particularly upside down Linda Styles which looks awfull.Overall it's a cheesy film but it has a great atmosphere and while I wouldn't call it scary it is definitely haunting.7,5/10.",In the Mouth of Madness

Sam Neil plays a man called John Trent who gets put into a psychiatric hospital because of something he did which the viewers don't know about,he then talks to a doctor and tells him the story of how he ended up there so everything we see in the film is everything before Sam Neil is put into the hospital. At the start of the film Sam Neil buys a bunch of books written by a man named Sutter cane who is a horror novelist. Sam Neils character doesn't really like horror books but he heard how popular they were and how well they were selling so he buys a few out of curiosity to see how scary these books actually are and he reads the books and he slowly starts to become interested in them. we also find out that some people that read these books slowly start to go mad and its announced that Sutter canes books seem to have a weird effect on its readers and throughout the film Sam Neil starts to see weird deformed people and unknown creatures and he thinks he's going crazy but is he really going crazy or are these creatures he's seeing real?. Sam Neil plays a freelance insurance investigator and he's hired to look for the horror novelist Sutter cane who has mysteriously gone missing. Sam Neil teams up with Julie Carmen to go searching for Sutter cane and they go off on an adventure together to find this man and figure out what is going on.Later in the film Sam Neil becomes convinced the whole disappearance is a publicity stunt but Julie Carmen thinks something has happened to Sutter cane and she tries to convince Sam Neil Something weird is going on. Throughout the film the two characters see weird people and strange things happening and some of the things they see are very bizarre and creepy. To sum things up in the mouth of madness is a very good film it was very gripping and has a cool unique storyline with two likable characters that i enjoyed watching.i definitely recommend the film its a must see.",In the Mouth of Madness
114,RobertF87,A Real Gem for Horror Fans,7,1 July 2012,"This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" (1994) and ""Scream"" (1996), which were horror films about horror. ""In the Mouth of Madness"", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film.The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear.The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King.John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly.For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments.Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.",In the Mouth of Madness
115,nick121235,Read a book,9,21 September 2019,"In the Mouth of Madness is an underrated horror film that is both literate and terrifying. Funny and intellectual, this movie has is the best representation of written horror that i've ever seen. There's always a marked difference between the way the genre comes across in films and in books, but this has the plot and the atmosphere of a good 20th century book and it really is top tier. If you, Like I, spent your childhood reading Stephen King then this will probably become one of your favorite films of all time very, very quickly.
Great dialogue, riveting plot, and Carpenter's usual beautiful use of widescreen cinematography as well as a top notch score. Simply the best the genre has to offer.",In the Mouth of Madness

This movie is both a tribute to the genre (and maybe a slight parody) and literally an existentialism story(you know what I mean when you finish the movie). This movie is scary, horrifying, intelligent, well written, well acted, and also somehow a bit funny.

117,Minus_The_Beer,A Labor of Lovecraft,8,27 August 2017,"John Carpenter's output from the late '70s throughout the '80s was so brilliant and iconic that when he crashed, he crashed hard. To say the '90s were not kind to the legendary director would be a massive understatement. ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man,"" ""Village of the Damned,"" anyone? The exception to this rule would be ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" one of the more satisfying H.P. Lovecraft adaptations not actually based on anything Lovecraft wrote. The script by Michael De Luca (a then-exec at New Line Cinema) pays dutiful homage to the writer's aesthetic, with perhaps more attention paid to the sprawling monstrosities that creep throughout the film than to narrative consistency.No matter though, as Carpenter is on his A-Game. The director brings with him the same visual knack that helped the film's spiritual brethren, ""Prince of Darkness,"" rise above its equally nonsensical story. Also, there's that rocking (and admittedly dated) guitar- driven score provided by Carpenter himself to help nudge things along. Those opening credits, underscored by that oh-so-'80s guitar, has the feel of an icon from the previous decade stubbornly refusing to bow to trends as he enters the next phase of his career (think of '80s heavy metal acts digging their heels in in the wake of Nirvana). Like the film itself, the music feels out of step with everything else going on in horror cinema at the time, which only adds to its appeal. Private investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is tasked with tracking down prolific horror novelist Sutter Cane (a Stephen King-type), who has suddenly vanished under mysterious circumstances. Was he kidnapped by an axe-wielding fanatic? Has he finally cracked and retreated to his sleepy New England homestead? Or is this is all one great, big publicity stunt? Trent re-tells this story after the fact to a doctor (David Warner, ironically coming face-to-face with his ""Omen"" foe once again) in the mental hospital he now calls home. His tale involves a beautiful companion (Julie Carmen) and some truly grotesque creatures, in what ultimately culminates in one great, big mind-trick. Carpenter brings with him a great deal of mad energy. It could be said that ""In the Mouth of Madness"" is the director's last, glorious gasp before settling into a mid-career slump that he has yet to pull out of. The story isn't always cohesive, but the film pushes along with considerable enthusiasm, often failing to slow down and catch the viewer up. Does this really matter when the film is so visually stimulating and its monsters equally intriguing? Not the slightest bit. A great film to watch in the wee hours of the night before the inevitable slumber, ""In the Mouth of Madness"" has a lot to offer within its gaping maw.",In the Mouth of Madness

At times a love letter to the works of H.P Lovecraft, In the Mouth of Madness is like Chinatown but freakish old ladies on bikes and villains straight out of Scooby Doo. You're always on edge when watching it, and due to the meta-like narrative it's difficult to work out just what the hell is going on. The movie tries to be too clever, and in doing so it trips over its own feet. Was Sam Neil living in a book? Was he even real? Was Sutter Cane real? Was he crazy? Why am I watching Sam Neil watch In the Mouth of Madness in cinemas? Am I crazy? Am I real? Who the hell are you?The muddled nature of the film is unfortunate, because this film feels like a missed opportunity for a superb horror-thriller. The camera work felt very mature and developed – I've got no complaints with how Carpenter filmed the movie. It's justit didn't work. Whatever the movie tried to do, it didn't work. And Julie Carmen was horrible.Best Scene: Just what was that thing on the bike?",In the Mouth of Madness
122,RomanJamesHoffman,Chilling meta-horror from the master,7,1 June 2012,"Horror meister John Carpenter's 'In the Mouth of Madness' is an unholy fusion of high-falutin meta-narrative and B-movie glory; essentially a postmodern cinematic rework reworking of H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos whose denizens from unimaginable realms constantly threaten to break free from captivity and wreck havoc upon earth.John Trent (Sam Neill) is a freelance insurance investigator who is hired by a publishing company to track down the insanely popular (and recently missing) horror writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), whose latest book inspires crazed schizophrenic delirium in its readers. Trent is initially sceptical and dismissive, even when he begins seeing unsettling portents all around him and having disturbing nightmares, and soon believes to have located Cane in a town called Hobb's End in New England. Accompanied by Cane's editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) they travel to the town where the unsettling portents grow more frequent and more sinister as Styles believes they have inadvertently crossed the barrier between reality and fiction and have actually become involved in the narrative of a Sutter Cane novel. When they eventually do track down Cane, Trent's scepticism crumbles in the face of all manner of inexplicable phenomena culminating in an encounter with the Great Old Ones and the collapse of his reality.In attempting a post-modern horror film Carpenter successfully adds a much-needed cerebral dimension to an otherwise visceral genre and has made a movie which can be appreciated by a horror neophyte as well as offering a wealth of references weaved in for seasoned horror fans to delight over. However, be warned: while this reviewer found the balance effective, I can see how the po-mo, meta, chin-strokey elements of the film could grate with some fans of classic (read: visceral) horror while being too cheesy (especially in some of the special effects) for the more discerning cinephile. This said, 'In the Mouth of Madness' is a fine addition to Carpenter's oeuvre and a dizzying descent into madness indeed.",In the Mouth of Madness
123,antoniokowatsch,Lovecraft would've loved this movie,7,1 November 2016,"As someone who has read all of Lovecrafts books I can assure you that this movie has a strong Lovecraftian vibe to it. And even the title seems to be some sort of homage to Lovecrafts work, I presume (In the mouth of madness -> Innsmouth ?) Or maybe I'm just over-interpreting things. Who knows?With that being said I really enjoyed the movie. It was refreshing and different. Sometimes the prospect of ""not knowing what's real or not"" is even scarier than straight up gore or monsters. After all the fear of the unknown is the ultimate essence of true horror. This movie had plenty of it so I can't complain.",In the Mouth of Madness
124,cmoyton,"""you want some too buddy?"" .Of course you do",9,15 May 2010,"This movie is the sole diamond in the latter day career of John Carpenter. Alas this return to form manifested itself in this film only. It could also be the best portrayal of Lovecraft's vision on screen without of course being directly sourced from Lovecraft.The character of Trent brilliantly played by the ever reliable Sam Neill relays his story to David Warner's character explaining how he has ended up in an asylum. As the movie progresses the worlds of fiction and reality merge and you are not sure if Trents story is the ramblings of a madman or if the events are actually happening. The opening shot of the ambulance abandoned outside the institution is one of several hints that the nightmare Trent describes may have begun in the world outside.Credit also to Jurgen Prochnow for his performance as horror novelist Sutter Cane. Cane is the conduit through which the ""old ones"" come through from the other side, their purpose being to destroy humanity. When the monsters do appear their screen time is rationed which is no bad thing.The movie is well paced with an intriguing plot and is laced with touches of trademark Carpenter humour. The first time i watched this movie the ending somewhat threw me but on repeat viewings makes perfect sense.

I kick myself for waiting so long to see In the Mouth of Madness.An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) is hired to track down the whereabouts of Sutter Cane, the most popular thriller author since Stephen King. He along with a secretary embark on a journey to find Cane's hometown. After a very bizarre car ride, they find the remote town and some very strange things start to happen. Fiction and reality combine to a world of horror.The eeriest scene I thought was during the car ride they pass a young boy on a bike. Seconds later a much older biker peddles by again and again. The older man is creepy looking and watching the movie for the first time I thought the biker was John Carpenter himself! The hair matched his, but after watching it in slo-mo, I could tell the person was way too short to be Carpenter.Overall it's a real shame this movie wasn't more successful in it's initial release, but then again most of Carpenter's movies bomb in theaters then become cult classics.

In the Mouth of Madness is not your typical horror, it may look like that from the trailer but let me tell you first hand that this film, as the title suggest, is pure and unflinching madness.In the Mouth of Madness has to be one of the most effective and well thought out horror pictures of the 90's maybe even today. It draws it's brilliance and dark theme straight from the minds of John Carpenter and Stephen King. It's morbid, dark, ingenious and oh so spooky. It's a film that resonates with the earlier works of John""Spooky"" Carpenter and without him this film would have failed miserably to really induce any real madness or scares. It's a brilliant and severely underrated film that if you watch it It will driver you mad.San Neill(Who does good here.) has some charm and great skill to be in horror as in half the movie once he get's to Hobbs End he is almost always petrified with fear at the horrific things he seems. It's quite amazing to watch and see how your fear can mount and grow into your worst paranoiac nightmare when you least expect it. But none the less the cast does great in this dark psychological horror film.This film is to me what Titanic is to romance fans. It's a horror gem the likes you have never really quite seen it's the type of film that will haunt your dreams and it will bleed into your reality making everything around you into something horrifying. it's a great film to see, but I have just one request if you do, be careful because if your not I can promise you this film will drive you absolutely mad.",In the Mouth of Madness

You have to really think about the movie for a whole day after watching it.In The Mouth Of Madness is completely set in the mind of the writer Sutter Cane straight from the beginning and Sam Neill is a character invented (just like every other character) by Sutter Cane. This is why Sutter is like a God because he is the writer and it is his mind. Hobb's End is a quaint little town that for some reason gives off an Agatha Christie vibe but heck when i turn 65 in a few decades time i wouldn't mind retiring there.

130,MadReviewer,"Great Premise, Flawed Results",6,17 April 2001,"""In The Mouth of Madness"" puts forth an interesting premise  what if H.P. Lovecraft was right? What if portals to horrific dimensions are waiting to be opened, and what if slavering, horrific creatures with god-like powers are waiting to return to Earth . . . and to destroy mankind?.
Well, `In the Mouth of Madness' is a lot like other John Carpenter films  interesting concepts, but the results are often hit or miss.  The film itself deals with an insurance investigator named John Trent (Sam Neill, in an unexpectedly great performance), a man who defines rational, logical thought.  A book publisher (a feisty Charlton Heston, who steals every scene he's in) sends Trent looking for a missing best-selling author  Sutter Caine, who's supposed to be a cross between H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. During his search for Sutter Caine, Trent finds himself encountering bizarre situations that literally come straight out of Sutter Caine's novels. . . and the situations get progressively worse and worse. 
The film moves along at a decent pace, and manages to put together a number of shocking, disturbing scenes (and also makes the viewer wonder at times if the horror onscreen is `real' or just in Trent's head), but it never manages to sustain its intensity for any significant length of time.  Some of the scenes which try to be horrifying wind up just being confusing, or stupid, or both.  Carpenter also relies a lot on camera tricks (extreme close-ups, quick scene cuts, etc.) which are supposed to be disturbing  and instead, they're intrusive and annoying.  Also, the special effects budget must've been awful, because the effects are a joke  check out Julie Carmen's dummy head!  Clint Eastwood made a more realistic looking head in `Escape From Alcatraz'! Still, the good outweighs the bad, and I have to give John Carpenter credit for at least trying to create a chilling horror film, even if the results are somewhat spotty.`In the Mouth of Madness' is decent, but not one of Carpenter's best.  For a great example of a John Carpenter horror mind-trip, check out `The Thing' first.  When you're finished with that, then watch `In the Mouth of Madness.'  It's slightly stupid at times, but fun nonetheless. B-/C+",In the Mouth of Madness

133,d_fienberg,"Super Concept, interesting direction, but still a ""B"" Movie",5,22 December 2000,"Apparently when In the Mouth of Madness was released HP Lovecraft received no credit of any kind. I can't honestly speak for whether the current IMDb credit that he gets is referring to a specific Lovecraft story, but it's clear that Michael DeLuca's script was heavily influenced by the general themes of Lovecraft's work, the blending of fact and fantasy and the doubt of whether there is such a thing as absolute truth and absolute reality.
Frankly, In the Mouth of Madness is a super concept and then very little more. It shouldn't be surprising that DeLuca's day job involves running New Line Pictures. This movie is a great pitch and then no real story telling, despite the game efforts of director John Carpenter.Sam Neill plays John Trent, an insurance investigator who always know when people are lying. As the film begins, Trent is already several tacos short of a combination plate. He's been tossed in an asylum and you know that this is a bad asylum because John Glover (generally prone to playing crazy characters himself) is sitting at the front desk. And then, to make matters worse, David Warner (who absurdly is now best known to audiences as one of the heavies in Titanic...) is called in to get his story.Apparently Trent was called in to track down a reclusive mystery writer who disappeared several chapters short of the conclusion of his most recent novel. Trent, of course, is a man you can't fool. You can't mess with his head. And the writer, Sutter Cane, has a reputation for writing books that drive people crazy. So it would be a battle of wills if it weren't so one-sided. Trent is sent off to a small New Hampshire town with Cane's editor (or agent, the distinctions get confusing at a certain point) and as soon as they get to the town they discover that something really bad is brewing. And to say anything more would probably confuse you, me, and anybody planning on seeing the movie.In the Mouth of Madness has a very familiar feel for fans of Carpenter's work. The plot contains elements of Village of the Damned and the special effects look a bit like the nasty creature in The Thing. Everything, however, looks really cheap. The New Hampshire town looks like a two location set. There's a town square and a scary Byzantine church. The actors are all cardboard cutouts, from Neill, who's completely incapable of carrying the film by himself (in fact, including his best Australian films, has he ever been given so much responsibility on screen?) to the completely amateurish Julie Carmen as his travelling companion. The supporting performances by Warner, Glover, Jurgen Prochnow, and Jurgen Prochnow are all just awful. The raises my major question: (And the is accompanied by a **MAJOR SPOILER!!!!**)Is the movie supposed to be bad? Or at least tacky in the ways that I've mentioned? As the final scene involves Trent going to see In the Mouth of Madness, can we just assume that in a metatextual sense this movie is cheesy because it's a cheesy adapatation of a cheesy imaginary book? Is the Hobb's End silly looking because it's not even supposed to be a real city? Are the performances bad because the characters are intentionally one dimensional? Is the entire film just supposed to be a bad film within a film? And as such is it just an homage to the classic British science fiction tradition from Lovecraft to Quatermass, etc?I think I may enjoy it more on that level. If there's a kind of multi-layered calculation that restricts quality than maybe it even succeeds for me. If you take the film as an examination of diminished audience returns, than it comments of low brow adapations of good books, etc. The evil force taking over the minds of everybody who reads Cane's books may capture the minds of the intelligent, but the film is supposed to attack people who don't read. It's low brow, then, for the sake of being low brow. And that may be very interesting.Left to its own devices, though, I just found myself remembering how wonderfully scary The Thing, Halloween, and the Fog are. And how Carpenter at his best used to be the master of tightly wound action plots, like Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13. I also found myself appreciating Lovecraft's skill even though he's never been a favorite of mine. At least he was always more successful in examining the rips in reality that he depicted. DeLuca just isn't up to the challenge.Since the movie did make me think and since I also accept the possibility that there is depth here that I'm not fully crediting, I'd give this one a 5/10. But even that may be a little high.",In the Mouth of Madness

I wasn't expecting much but this blew me away. It's easily one of the most satisfyingly scary movies I've seen, and I'm a big horror nerd. One thing I've learned is that to truly enjoy a horror movie, you have to get in the right mindset - lower your guard, crank the volume up, and most importantly you have to want to be scared. It may not be the same for everyone, but if you're desensitized like me from seeing almost all the movies on everyone's top horror film lists and coming away untouched, it's the only way to go. This movie brought me back to the experience of fear I haven't felt since childhood.If supernatural thrillers are far more terrifying than real-life horror, then definitely check this out. It's a living nightmare in the vein of Jacob's Ladder and is epic, sophisticated horror at its best. The atmosphere is unnerving and the tension and shocks are jarring, to say the least. The scene on the highway with a boy on a bicycle simultaneously is chilling and full of pure horror. A scene in a hotel lobby involving people moving in a painting and a sweet old lady that is hiding something sinister is one that created a major impact on me. After certain scenes where I had the pants scared off me I was left with an adrenaline rush that filled me with joy.

142,Minsky95,Carpenter should make more like this!,10,4 April 2002,"I absolutely loved this film.  Let me tell you why.  I loved this film becuase it's pretty scary.  I'm a horror fan and a movie that scares me is something I look forward to.  This movie is strange which makes it very creepy.  I loved how the music makes you jump at certain parts of the film. John Carpenter is great at composing music for this reason.  I loved where the movie was filmed.  It's film in a small deserted town and that makes every all the more creepy.  Sam Neille does a great job of struggling about whether he is in the real world or a made up character by Sutter Kane.  For those of you who have not seen it, one of the creepiest scenes, I think, was during the road scene.  You have to watch it so you know what I mean.  If you want a good scare, watch this movie and make sure the lights are off. Also a good date movie becuase the girl might sit closer to you and grab you.  Great John Carpenter movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",In the Mouth of Madness
143,arkif1,Carpenter's take on the apocalypse.,10,23 October 2019,"Carpenter's apocalypse trilogy is literally about the apocalypse. The Thing is about not being believed when one sees it coming. Prince of Darkness is about what Christ's teaching has been replaced with. And this glorious film is about the falling into place of things in the initiated mind.""He sees you."" Whom? A cynic who looks behind appearances. Somebody who is himself seeing. The seer is being seen. ""A man will come, the Kwisatz Haderach, he will go where we can not"" ""and start the change."" A change akin to that in ""They Live"", the difference here being that the process of recognition was free in ""They Live"", but here it has been prescribed.""You're waiting to hear about my them?"" Looking for the enemy. But where is the enemy? The enemy is a shift in perspective, recognizing habituation to violence as something evil, for example.So, what is Carpenter saying? People let all kinds of things into their minds and those things have their way with them there. But there is no freedom in this process. The path has been foretold. ""God's not supposed to be a hack horror writer. - But maybe I can help you believe."" Strange. How we succumb as if we were characters in a novel.Carpenter sees it as it is, but his heart is bleeding. How can man, the miracle that he is, let this happen to himself? Why the fascination with destruction, if only by negligence? Does nobody love life and people?Too high standards? Perhaps not. The logic of it in a nutshell.",In the Mouth of Madness
144,droogiedim77,ONE OF CARPENTER'S BEST!!!,10,29 August 2002,"Being a huge horror movie fan, I am also a huge fan of John Carpenter. This movie is one of the best and also one of the last to come out in a great time for horror. Ever since Scream came out, it seems that most horror movies are more and more watered down so they can be marketed to a younger audience. This film was released a year before this disappointing trend arrived. Not only that, this is almost a forgotten gem and a link to the heyday of his career. Carpenter has always put out great work, but hasn't put anything out to rival his ""platinum era."" I call the time between 1978-1984 the platinum era, seeing as each one of his films from the era or masterpieces. Not only are they masterpieces in their own right, but it seems like each film gets better in its own way. It started with the beginning of the franchise/slasher era with Halloween. He followed up Halloween with the excellent ghost story that is The Fog. After The Fog he put out 4 more classics: Escape from New York, with the antihero Snake Plissken; The Thing, a landmark in special effects which could be argued to be the best film of his career; Christine, which gets my vote for best Stephen King adaption and coolest car; and the touching Starman, a sci-fi love story. After this his work was still golden, but had more of a b-movie feel to it. This included the camp classic They Live and the anthology Body Bags. In the Mouth of Madness displays the brilliance shown in the ""platinum era."" I don't want to spoil anything, but this is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years. Of course, this didn't break any records at the box office. Not only did this come out in a time before horror became cool again, it was also a time when tickets were $5 for evening shows. Nevertheless, this movie is done well on all fronts. Carpenter knows how to make you jump out of your seat and presents some really unsettling visuals. I get a little more creeped out with each viewing. Sam Neill puts in a great performance, and Julie Carmen also does well in her supporting role. Another Carpenter score to perfectly compliment the movie. This movie is also shot very well, and boasts an excellent script. A must for all Carpenter fans and highly recommended to any fans new to the horror genre. Turn the lights down low and enjoy!",In the Mouth of Madness
145,Deviant-7,John Carpenter's scariest film since The Thing.,10,6 January 1999,"John Carpenter is one of my favorite directors, and this movie is a great example of why.  Excellent film, with fantastic performances by everyone in it.  An original plot that combines mystery, suspense, and all-out true HORROR.  This is definitely a Must-See movie.  You will never forget it after you have seen it, trust me.  One thing that I have noticed over the years, and I believe it to be a fact:  John Carpenter movies always end on a down-note.  Remember that the next time you see one of his films.",In the Mouth of Madness
146,GenK1981,One of Carpenters better jobs.,8,11 February 2005,"Recently we have seen some truly awful work of the great man. Yes i still regard him as the great man because we should always remember the great films he did release that made an impact in the 80's and 90's. Forget Vampires and Ghost of Mars and let us remember his work such as The Thing, Haloween, The Fog, Prince of Darkness......and this little gem.In the Mouth of Madness is one of those horror films, just like The Thing, where at the time of its release not many people really acknowledged it. But now 10 years on because horror movies are being made so badly at the moment we have to rely on the past to show us how a true horror movie is really done.The film is about Sam Neils character John Trent who is a hired Insurance Investigator trying to track down Cult Horror writer Sutter Cane played by Jurgen Prochnow, who apparently has gone missing. Trent accompanied by Julie Carmens character Linda Styles journey to a town to find the writer only to discover they have entered a place which breaks the realms of reality.From there on it becomes a question of where is Sutter Cane and what has happened to him.The assembled cast is reasonably good. Sam Neil and Jurgen Prochnow do good jobs and Carmen is okay as the lead female. Add in a few star short appearances from David Warner and Charlton Heston and you've overall got a pretty decent crew.The effects are good. Some of the creature designs remind me of 'The Things' work back in the 80's. CGI is so overrated when it comes to capturing a persons imagination based on horror i feel.As for the music, yep its got the recognisable John Carpenter work as usual. The guys multi-talented what can i say? A good film.8/10",In the Mouth of Madness

It also reminded me of ""Event Horizon"" because of Sam Neill's face with crosses written all over it. Another great one from John Carpenter.",In the Mouth of Madness
148,MovieManiacX,One Of Carpenter's Best!,10,18 March 2005,"I gotta say that when I first saw this movie, it blew me away. It's not as good as The Thing, but it's a great horror movie. It has everything that makes John Carpenter the master of horror. He is one man that can still scare the crap out of me.In The Mouth Of Madness is about Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow), this century's most widely-read author. When Cane disappears, his publishing company Arcane, run by the very gruff-looking Jackson Harglow (Charleton Heston), enlists John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator, to find him. Trent agrees after he is almost killed by an axe-wielding maniac that turns out to be Cane's agent. He and Arcane editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) find Cane's fictional town of Hobb's End and then all hell breaks loose.First things first. I loved the opening score. It starts off very simplistic and then goes into full hard rock mode. Excellent music throughout, too.Onto the characters. Before I say anything, I have to say the Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors. He can truly act, expressing a full range of emotions: angry, annoyed, happy, cocky, flabbergasted, etc. You name it, he can pull it off. Anyway, Sam Neill plays John Trent perfectly. This is a guy who's good at his job and he likes it. He can see right through you; see what you're capable of. It's fun to watch him try to make sense out of all the madness around him, especially once he arrives in Hobb's End. Julie Carmen, unfortunately, looks as if she's about to fall asleep or that she's stoned (I don't know which, probably both) throughout the whole movie. She serves her purpose though. Let's talk about the real star of this movie. As with Sam Neill, Jurgen Prochnow is perfect as Sutter Cane. I can't think of anyone who could have played the part better. This man's got the look, the voice, and the attitude to make Cane extremely believable. If anyone can play the bringer of the apocalypse, it's this guy. Charleton Heston looks like he's got something stuck up his butt, but plays Harglow just fine (I think this actually helps his character!). I personally think he could beat the crap out of Sutter Cane if it really came down to it. The other characters are all minor, but one deserves an honorable mention. David Warner as Dr. Wrenn is great. This man can handle himself and can give Sam Neill a run for his money (even though he doesn't try to here).The gore and special effects are fantastic. It's nice to see a movie in the 90's where CGI is non-existent. (The only two movies where CGI has tricked me into thinking what I was watching was real (or at least animatronic) are Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers. Most of the time, I (or anyone else for that matter) can spot CGI easily. Not so in those two movies.) Anyway, (I go off on tangents a lot, so get used to it) everything from the dead/undead cop, the axe-maniac's eyes, the creature that's part of Cane's back, and the vile abominations, was superb. Nice work guys at KNB! No complaints here.I will admit that Carpenter got me with almost every ""boo"" scare in the movie, particularly the one at the end (used to a far better effect here than at the end of Resident Evil). But those scares are only temporary. When someone says a movie was ""really scary"", I want to see something that will stick with me and always be in the back of my mind. These are the best kind of scares which define ""true"" horror. We don't get very many of these types of scares anymore, which really makes me mad. But just as I had hoped, Carpenter pulls it off here (and in a few of his other movies, too) perfectly.Finally, I loved the ending! Apocalyptic endings always so much more satisfying than happy endings. Carpenter is always known for his ""hook"" endings and this was one of his best.I've said it before and I'll say it again, John Carpenter was, is, and always will be the master of horror. 'Nuff said.",In the Mouth of Madness
149,FSfilmblog,Carpenters last great movie...?,10,12 March 2011,"The last great John Carpenter film before he started to regurgitate and recycle his own movies. This is the final part of his apocalypse trilogy which started off with ""The Thing"" (1982), then following on with ""The Prince Of Darkness""(1987) and ending with this Lovecraftian influenced story.The story involves an author aptly named Stutter Cane (sounds remarkably similar to Stephen King) who has disappeared on the eve of the launch of his latest masterpiece. Enter our ""hero"", John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance fraud investigator hired by the publisher to locate the author and the unreleased novel. Rumblings through the press and media describe how some fans of the books become crazed and deranged by the effects the books have on them and become hysterical, eagerly awaiting the release of the forthcoming book.Sceptical over the whole media circus revolving over the disappearance and believing it all to be a ploy to drum up more frenzy and interest for the new novel , Trent sets out to prove it as just a marketing strategy to increase sales. Accompanying Trent is Cane's editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), who tags along to make sure the novel is found and delivered on time for publication Over the course of the film Trent discovers not all what it seems. He tracks Cane down through his book covers which lead him a town written in his books called Hobb's End which doesn't appear on any maps and finds them driving on a freeway for hours and hours aimlessly before they suddenly stumble upon this eerie and dis-quietening town. Of course Trent still thinks that all of this is some sort of gimmick and a trick where the town and it's townsfolk are played by actors to represent the fictional characters along with the buildings and locations written in the novels by Cane. As the unexpected start to happen, Trent realises that the towns folk and the town isn't a theme park based on the books but in actual fact, reality and fiction mixing and merging where the words of the author becoming a deadly reality and leaving is not so easy.That's the main arc of the narrative and Carpenter manages to weave the complex and interesting ideas which not all come off but manages to combine suspense with a few jumpy moments (some which are cheap and expected) but a John Carpenter film is always watchable. It's only let down by the sheer weight of the story, it doesn't finish as strongly as it starts. But that doesn't mean it's not an enjoyable film. The direction by Carpenter is by far the strongest element though soundtrack isn't one of the more memorable Carpenter compositions. The acting on the whole is good, though some actors do look a little out of place (Charlton Heston as the publisher being one) not saying the performances were bad, they just felt odd.There are some great set pieces and great build ups to some of the scenes that it makes me sad to think Carpenter hasn't had a hit or made a good film in such a long time. Like I stated at the beginning, this is the last great John Carpenter film which is cruelly unavailable in the UK (you can import the French DVD which is compatible in the UK but has French subs if you can stand it). I luckily have a copy as I was sick and tired of waiting for UK release. If you can find a copy on VHS or it scheduled to show on TV give it a go. The last great, master of suspense horror film that isn't all blood, guts and gore but a great showmanship of skill and talent from what was once a brilliant director who seems intent on tarnishing the memories of what was once a glittering career.

A lot of people aren't intelligent enough to enjoy a movie that relies on stunning visuals, a great plot, and chilling atmosphere.  How can you lose with Sam Neill being the lead actor?  Watching his descent into madness as reality and fantasy merge is actually pretty funny.  To me it's more funny than hearing Busta Rhymes say, ""Trick or treat motha fuc*a!""  This is not a movie where there are a bunch of stupid teenagers running around so if your favorite movie is Urban Legends avoid this.  But if you like a deep horror movie that lets you think and see some amazing acting, definitely check this out.

What I saw is a rather cliched prosthetic monster movie with much rolling of eyes and fright night screams. Maybe it's an allegory about popular media (at the end, specifically cinema), but if so, the message with it's twist ending is little more than a ""hey, wouldn't it be cool if ..."" idea dreamt up by some teen wannabe screenwriter. It might have worked with a slower pace, perhaps, with a more subtle horror, like in Don't Look Now, but this was obviously aimed at the box office and comes across as something Hammer might have done in it's later days.

Having said that, I was not exactly excited when I bought the ticket for this one.  Surprise, surprise.  This film hit me directly between the eyes, starting with the savagely intelligent (and more than a tad tongue-in-cheek) screenplay and Sam Neill's dynamite performance.  The concept is a little shopworn, but given the Lovecraft homage, not inappropriately.  The only real quibble I have is the same one everyone has: namely, Julie Carmen (sorry, Julie, but this is not your finest 90 minutes).

Perfect film to watch around October and Halloween.Find it, buy it, watch it. Let's just hope Carpenter has at least one more like this still in him.

This film is so terrifying and very smart, and has great monster effects (which are very subtle, but scary) I like how it doesn't give it's plot away in a linear way, it presents the scary plot through clues and flashbacks and the ending will leave you freaked out, as it doesn't show what you know is about to happen (if you payed enough attention). IF you have seen the movie, read on-Spoilers below- read only if you've seen the movie:My take on the ending: So everybody who read the book became a monster, and they made a movie so people who didn't read would still be turned into monsters also.

The plot is so distinctive and twisted that it's a wonder why the movie never got the attention it deserved.  If there is one drawback to the plot, it would be that it was unclear whether or not it went a little TOO far. The movie would have been just as scary and more believable if they left it with Sutter Cane's books causing mass insanity rather than going on with the books actually being self-fulfilling prophecies.  But then again, the self-fulfilling prophecy angle could all be a delusion from Sam Neill too, which would be plausible.

163,LovecraftLass,Have you read Sutter Cane?,10,4 January 2018,"I can't believe that it took me so long to watch this movie. It has practically everything I love in it: Lovecraft, Stephen King, and a ton of references to look for and spot and conjecture about. In short, I'm very disappointed in myself for not watching it sooner. In my defense, I had no idea it was even about a book, so, there ya go.I loved the plot to it. It was creepy and took many unexpected twists and turns. Reality itself gets distorted in interesting ways that did not come across as cheatery and contrived. It also raises some interesting questions about readers and the free will of the characters in fiction.Sorry, a small digression here. Just pretend for a moment that it's true (c'mon, you can do it, you guys read horror and sci-fi. I know you have imaginations). That a fictional character is aware of what is happening to him or her. They realize this but can't do anything about it. They are forced to live through whatever unimaginable horror the author can think of to inflict upon them. I can't imagine anything more horrifying. I'm not really talking about meta-horror, exactly, because to me it's a different kind of awareness.Anyways, you didn't read this to get my half-assed attempt at midnight psychology. You want to hear about the movie. It starts out with a bang and the pace keeps up until the last fifteen minutes or so. It does start to slow down a bit near the end but it's a necessary slowness so it's acceptable. The plot stays on point throughout without any digressions that don't add to the movie.The effects are top-notch and some really managed to give me the creeps. Some of the creepier ones are also the most simple. Maybe not simple to pull off but in the plot they're somewhat minor happenings but add to the general atmosphere and general creepiness. The bridge into Hobb's End. The changing picture. Simple, but very effective. And the creature effects? Excellent.Sam Neill is very believable as the cocky insurance investigator, totally convinced he is the master of his own, cynical view of the world. Julie Carmen is very able in her role, if a little lat at times but since I've never seen her in anything else I'm not really sure if that was an acting choice or her typical acting ability. Jürgen Prochnow is perfect as the ""author"" of the end of the world. Oddly enough, this is not the first time Jürgen has brought about the Apocalypse. The first time was in a movie called 'The Seventh Sign"" (which I'll be reviewing soon). He's perfect as the elusive Sutter Cane. Even the secondary characters are played well.And of course, all the references. I'd love to point out as many as I noticed (and I'm pretty sure there's more I didn't) but since some are plot points I don't want to spoil anything for you. I don't like to assume that just because a movie is older then it's ok to tell the whole story. Suffice it to say that there are many and Lovecraft and King fans alike will have many happy egg hunts.There is only one part that I don't get and it bugs me: SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD BUT A MINOR ONE - How on Earth did he figure out that the book covers make a map? Was it wiping the ink under his eyes? I have no idea.",In the Mouth of Madness
164,Irate_Tyrant,In The Mouth Of Madness,10,24 July 2006,"""I think, therefore you are.""John Carpenter is a patron saint of the macabre. There's really been no arguing that statement since ""Halloween"", and after you get a taste of his Apocalypse Trilogy it will be engraved forever in your unconscious. At first consideration, a movie about a book seems like a retread and certainly ill-fated for the horror genre. Thankfully, Carpenter binds the idea like a hardcover classic, and shakes our preconceptions of the timeless film adaptation.""Beware the hobby that eats."" -Benjamin FranklinHobbies that become obsessions often alienate us from the rest of society. Yet, reading, although when we are young is almost a magical escape from reality, is more and more as we grow older and progress through schooling, simply about unanimous interpretation and less about anonymous opinion. We can all of course, hold our personal thoughts on an excerpt, but even the Bible itself has been analyzed to the point that most passages are agreed upon by the majority of experts as to their meanings. Before you read to much further into this review, try to empathize with the writer at this junction of expression. If a book has a theme, and the theme is powerful enough to capture the reader for a certain amount of time, wouldn't it be the author's integrity to attempt to change the reader's viewpoint after completion of a novel?The question posed by ""In The Mouth Of Madness"", the third and last installment in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy, is what would happen if a book contained a theme and underlying message so strong, that it not only changed the readers' lives, but their entire perception of reality? Some may credit Wes Craven for laying out groundwork for this startling look at popular culture in ""New Nightmare"", but the major difference for ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" is the seriousness of the subject. There are plenty of people that cite films as being big inspirations in their lives, but there is a much vaster populace that will directly relate themselves to a book, whether religious, fictional, or historic. What if these people were to read a different type of book, by an insane genius, and took the inspiration in a slightly different way? It is, after all, the most hands-on experience to be in control of your own imagination.The story offered in the movie is very concept-driven. A world-renown novelist, Sutter Cane (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of ""The Seventh Seal"") disappears off of the face of the planet right before the publication of his proclaimed last book in a series that has stormed the country with fanatic rage. It becomes the job of Sam Neill as John Trent, an insurance investigator, to decide where Sutter Cane has holed himself up, and whether the whole fiasco is actually a publicity stunt. Julie Carmen as Linda Styles, Cane's editor, accompanies him in his search. Charlton Heston also has a cameo appearance as the executive of Cane's publishing company.To get off on the right foot, Trent caves in and begins to read the Cane books. Immediately he realizes the potency of the writing and begins having nightmares. So when he convinces himself that the author has retreated to a town called ""Hobb's End"", located in New Hampshire, we can't help but wonder whether he is already losing his mind. Hobb, in ancient writing was a word used to refer to the devil, and the town with the namesake is not found on any modern map.So Styles and Trent are in a sense signing away their souls. Hobb's End, as it turns out is one of the most memorably creepy towns in movie history. Sutter Cane is pretty easy to find, on the other hand, once they arrive. Too bad nobody packed a Bible, is all I can say. It turns out that Cane has already planned for their arrival, leading Trent to become the skeptist, and Styles to act more as a guide for the duo. Hobb's End is directly out of Cane's last novel, and it definitely adds to the atmosphere when Trent is being read directions from it, as if it were a travel guide.Well, I've avoided spoiling many of the plot points and surprises in this film. This is one of the few horrors that I find myself watching again and again, without losing understanding of the original foreboding ambiance, or respect for the scenes where blood pressure raises. Loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft stories, and with a lot of homage paid to Stephen King and many of the campy B-movies that Carpenter grew up watching, this film is indeed chilling and thought-provoking.""A reality is just what we tell each other it is.""""In The Mouth Of Madness"" (1995) 10/10",In the Mouth of Madness
165,kheops,A masterpiece of fantastic genre,10,15 January 1999,"This movie, as I read it, is loved by everybody. And I cannot say I'm not because it's one of the best Carpenter's movies (I did not see ""Dark Star"", ""Assault on the precinct 13"" and ""The thing"" yet. I still don't know what was reality, what was not. It's the only movie where the physical fear (quite tough) is weaker than mental fear. It's a masterpiece. Really scary (just forget about ""I know what you did last summer"", b*******t for tourists as Mister Brown would say). Carpenter is the only director where the titles say exactly what is gonna be shown in the movie. That's why we're never disappointed. If he had been called for ""Armageddon"", for example, the world would have been destroyed, ""Godzilla"", there would have been a scary monster and not a tiny saurian. Carpenter wants people to spend time watching a movie for something, that's what he does with his movies. This is a movie whose pictures can't be forgotten. You can't forget the cyclist, Sutter Cane's ""house"", the corridor, the bleed tears... As I said, it's a masterpiece of fantastic genre.",In the Mouth of Madness

Started so good, there was so many commericals when this movie came out that made me want to see it.  If you have seen The Thing, Escape from New York and They live, you know Carpenter is a master,  do not watch this movie, its that bad.

167,Dolf,Great Lovecraftian horror flick.,10,4 January 1999,"""In The Mouth Of Madness"" was another great horror film from John Carpenter, packed with surprises and suspense.  Some Carpenter films have fallen below expectations, but this is surely not one of them.This film was downright frightening.  Most horror films are easily figured out about 5 minutes into the film.  ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" keeps surprising the viewer every scene, right up until the film's climax.Sam Neill is fantastic - is there anyone better at playing a man going insane than Sam Neill?  Jürgen Prochnow also does a fine job as the scary and ""a few cards short of a full deck"" villain.  Julie Carmen is adequate, if unimpressive, and doesn't detract from the rest of the cast.The film has many scenes based on works of horror by H.P. Lovecraft.  If you are familiar with Lovecraft's work you will probably find the film more enjoyable, simply because there are some inside jokes that only a Lovecraft fan would understand.  Also the ""Sutter Kane"" books in the film are parodies of H.P. Lovecraft stories - very amusing if you know the works.If you aren't a fan of the horror genre, you'll probably avoid seeing this film - but you'd be missing a wonderfully done tale of suspense in the process.",In the Mouth of Madness

John Carpenter has changed my perception on that now. How was it?...AMAZING! No, to simple. Utterly and visually MADNESS!(no pun). Like really. How does something like this with just practical effects make such outrageous and horrifying monsters seem so real? I gotta appreciate this movie even more, because today's standards this movie wouldn't fly. At all. Period. CGI would made this film have no weight and look cartoonish at most. Sam Neill(an older actor that I enjoy watching I admit) does his best here feeling the dread and fear of paranoia, that he completely looks like he lost himself in the role. And you know what else? HE COULD OF! You see those thing on set, you would have something to be afraid of!! Again, making my point about the problems with today's horror.I never seen this movie beyond this review. Now? I have. And I'm happy to say I completed Carpenters Apocalypse Trilogy making me a complete fan for good.

169,abs-ghosh,Still A Classic!,7,2 June 2019,"I remember watching this movie on TV plenty of times but always came away creeped out and confused by it. I have been on a horror binge since the start of 2019 and have run out of movies to watch in that category. Since then I have been diving into my dusty mental list of golden oldies from the 80's to the mid 2000's. In the Mouth of Madness was not on that list. I got curious about Sam Neils, the actor's, whereabouts after re-watching Event Horizon (still holds up) a week ago. Back in the day he was in almost every other movie and I was curious if he was still around and then suddenly I remembered that movie I didn't like. I ended up watching it last night and ended up appreciating this underlooked Carpenter classic a lot more than 10 year old me did.Sutter Kane, a critically acclaimed and highly successful horror novelist goes missing almost overnight in the middle of writing his next book in a very popular series. The fans are not happy with the sudden delay and riots break out in the streets while the few people that received the first few manuscript of Kane's latest work have gone insane.
John Trent, a successful insurance claim/fraud investigator is appointed to Kane's publisher to verify the integrity of their insurance claim. Not convinced the author is truly missing, Trent sets out to track down the missing writer with the condition that Kane's editor also accompanies him during the investigation. With no real clues to his whereabouts except for the map of a fictional city of Hobbes End, the duo set out on a 'needle-in-a-haystack' journey to find the real town the Hobbes End draws its inspiration from only to find themselves in the town itself. Town is real and so are the people! But Kane's editor thinks different as she starts recognizing location and characters from Kane's books. As surreal adventure takes on a nightmarish turn, there is a realization that they may have ended up being characters in Kane's new book.This movie is dark and twisted. One of the biggest things it gets right is the portrayal of LoveCraftian horror, setting an effective atmosphere that gives it the raw edge. I think this movie might been a little too ahead of its time it was around a time where ambiguous endings were not a trend. It might have fit in better in the later 2000's where such type of movies were better realized. Still if you are out of movies and barely remember this title, its worth going back.",In the Mouth of Madness

Now, THE THING is considered a classic re-make; PRINCE OF DARKNESS definitely -- at least, for me -- stands as a cult classic. This movie, however, is neither.The conceit, namely, an author's work becomes reality as he writes, is not a very original idea. Maybe, it was a novel (no pun intended) idea when H. P. Lovecraft was writing (to whom the film tips its hat) -- but, no longer. Moreover, the other conceit, namely, that a person realizes that he or she is actually a character in the author's work, is another mold-covered idea.The film is generally described as a ""psychological"" horror film. In other words, it ain't scary! What you will get is a lot of weird characters (e. g., an old lady with her husband handcuffed to her ankle), weird situations (e. g., not being able to find the mysterious town, Hobb's End), and weird dialogue (e. g., random people coming up and saying, ""He sees you""). Remember, this movie was made just a few years after the success of T. V.'s TWIN PEAKS.If one were to never have watched this movie, I could not say that he or she had missed anything. A John Carpenter-enthusiast would definitely want to give it a viewing, except that that would probably be enough: a viewing -- just to say he'd watched it.As a _movie_, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is not bad. As a _horror movie_, though, it is not good. Carpenter seems to forget in this instance how to bring tension and scares to the audience. In the commentary, he pats himself on the back for having a dark figure -- an ""extra"" -- walk quickly infront of the camera as Sam Neill walks down a corridor the other way. ""A cheap scare,"" he preens. ""But, I like cheap scares."" Noooo, John . . . NOT scary at all! And, that really is the whole problem with this film.I say: Watch it; enjoy it as the fluff that it is; and, forget it. There's better out there. If you were to purchase it, then I recommend buying it as part of Carpenter's trilogy mentioned above. It's certainly not worth the full price of a DVD.",In the Mouth of Madness

177,RottenPop-Sid,John Carpenter presents an original Lovecraftian tale,8,14 March 2020,"In the Mouth of Madness is an American psychological horror film from director John Carpenter. It serves as the third and final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy of movies. The others being Prince of Darkness and The Thing. Starring Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jürgen Prochnow, David Warner and Charlton Heston. The film was distributed by New Line Pictures and released on December 10th, 1994 in Italy before being released in the US the following year.The story is told in a flashback. An insurance adjuster (Sam Neill) is investigating the disappearance of horror writer Sutter Cane. After his books seem to be having a strange effect on his readers. He goes with the writers editor (Julie Carmen) to look for the fictional town, Hobb's End. In hopes of finding the reclusive writer. They actually find the town and find themselves being written into the next best selling Sutter Cane book. Or, did they not exist until Cane wrote about them?The psychological elements are incorporated with a lot of care and respect for the genre. Carpenter did an amazing job delivering tension and anxiety in every scene. This is a perfect homage to Lovecraftian works, while also putting a finish on the Apocalypse Trilogy.Sam Neill goes off the rails with his performance. We watch this man have a mental-breakdown and it's awesome. His character, John Trent, is a sceptical insurance adjuster that travels to the seemingly fictional town of Hobbs End to find the horror novelist, Sutter Cane. It's An oddball locale to lose your mind in. A place full of tortured souls and creatures from beyond.The downside is the obvious financial limits that John Carpenter had to work with. The film was shot in Canada and for some reason some of the lines were poorly over-dubbed. It takes me out of the movie every time. I think the worst is Sutter Canes agent breaking a window and asking, ""...do you read Sutter Cane?"" I just don't like it.Although it has a few flaws, John Carpenter's Lovecraftian love-letter is definitely worth a watch. In the Mouth of Madness provides a lot of anxiety driving scenes that will keep you positioned on the edge of your seat for the entire viewing. I have seen this film multiple times now.

The tongue-in-cheek approach, emphasized by Neill's transition from skeptic to raving lunatic, will make any pulp fiction reader smile knowingly.There aren't any real scares in this one, per se, but it does well enough in establishing a surreal, claustrophobic atmosphere that makes you wonder exactly where reality ends. When it's campy it's fun, but it also has its share of good horror scenes that can also make you think.After watching the horrible ""Vampires,"" I had to watch this one again to make sure it was the same director, but Carpenter did, in fact, do a good job on this one.

There are a few flaws in it, but I don't let them get in the way of a great movie.The movie begins with John Trent (Sam Neill) being dragged into an insane asylum in a straitjacket, trying to tell the orderlies that he's not insane. He is visited by Dr. Wren (David Warner), who is trying to help get him out of there. When asked how he got to the hospital, Trent tells him about his job as a freelance insurance investigator and that it all started with the disappearance of Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow). At the diner, Robbie (Bernie Casey), who runs the insurance company Trent worked at, is at a diner trying to convince him to start working for him and tells him that there's a claim that Sutter Cane is missing that cost millions. Suddenly, an axe-wielding maniac smashes the diner window and asks Trent, ""Do you read Sutter Cane?"" before he's shot to death by police. Later, Trent is told by Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) that Cane's books have a mentally scarring effect on his less stable readers. He discovers a couple nights later that Hobb's End, the town from many of Cane's novels is real, and starts to see the nightmarish truth behind the strange behavior of his readers ... and his own existence.Really creepy movie that deserves to have others similar to it, and a great homage to one of my favorite horror authors. My only complaint is Julie Carmen. I don't remember much about her in Fright Night Part II, but her acting in this movie was really bad. Still, it doesn't kill the movie, and towards the end, Trent says something that has haunted me for a long time: ""Every species can smell its own extinction. The last ones left won't have a pretty time with it. In ten years, the human race will just be a bedtime story for the children, a myth.

When the film first starts we see an old horror classic setting in the lunatic asylum and John Trent (Sam Neil) has just checked in. Once Neil is being interviewed about how he got there we see the film as told by his recollection of the past events that led up to him arriving there. Now this is where I got interested as it did a good job of setting up the premise and for the first 40 minutes or so it really is an interesting ride. There are a some nicely shot scenes and you do get a sense of eeriness and it is a little unsettling in parts but unfortunately the film runs out of steam fairly quickly and the end result was disappointing as the film is too all over the place and disjointed by the time the credits roll. The acting on the whole wasn't too great either, I thought Sam Neil did a good enough job but the supporting cast were pretty poor as were some of the special effects.

Carpenter pursuits his career with a coherency seldom met at the American directors; his obsessions and preferences become an ars poetica, shaping more elaborate forms. Carpenter's horror touches us deep inside not by what we are shown, but by what we are suggested to believe. Just like many pop and movie stars do nowadays, Sutter Cane has a whole world down on its knees. This evil wants reduction to sameness, wants to make the audiences all around the world think the same, be the same, act the same. Only then is Cane, as he proclaims, God. The entire horror phenomenon is pointed at and -in a way- mocked at, because the bad influence of horror products is revealed fully.A continual and dark nightmare, the movie proves to be a skilled postmodernistic approach to H.P. Lovecraft's writings, not only in the atmosphere, but also in the visualisation and plot. Sam Neill is flawless as detective John Trent and Julie Carmen-comfortable in her part. The writer is the German actor Jurgen Prochnow who brings a necessary European flavour to the character.

194,mjbridges82,Far from Carpenter's best.,5,27 April 2005,"""I'm sorry about the balls! It was a lucky shot, that's all!"" Sam Neill's strained delivery of this line managed to illicit an early chuckle. As In the Mouth of Madness continued, I began to notice that this lament applied to the entirety of the proceedings. Any impact, testicular or otherwise, that the film had seemed to be down to ""a lucky shot"" rather than crafted direction.John Carpenter is a director with a somewhat chequered record. Responsible for classics such as Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1982), Carpenter also has the dubious distinction of helming misfires like Ghosts of Mars (2001), Escape from L.A. (1996) and Big Trouble in Little China (1986). In the Mouth of Madness falls somewhere muddy in between the extremes.Penned by studio executive and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) author Michael De Luca, the film plays like a TV movie mystery with a H.P. Lovecraft pre-occupation. Sam Neill plays John Trent, a seemingly pre-eminent freelance insurance claims investigator, hired by a publisher to locate their missing star talent, Sutter Cane, played Jurgen Prochnow. Cane is a ubiquitous horror writer, one of those literally 'big names' who's moniker dwarfs the title on the cover. Apparently his works have a profoundly disquieting affect on the less mentally stable members of his vast fan base, and the anticipation for his latest volume is at a violent fever pitch. In what is probably the film's most successful scene, even Cane's agent succumbs to the hysteria in time tested axe wielding fashion. The ever sceptical Trent is eventually dispatched to a possibly non-existent little corner of New England, along with the horribly stilted Julie Carmen playing Cane's editor, Linda Styles. The spookiness then begins in earnest, is it all a publicity stunt? Has Cane gone mad? Can Carpenter manage to hold things together long enough for us to care? In the Mouth of Madness clearly has lofty ambitions. The framing device initially seems hackneyed but grows in to almost David Lynch territory. H.P. Lovecraft's material, although not directly adapted here, is notoriously difficult to bring to the screen, and has been unsuccessfully relied upon to bring the bulk of the scares. My ultimate impression is that neither De Luca nor Carpenter have a firm enough grasp on the material to make a coherent or entertaining film.My expectations of the film were immediately lowered by the horribly clichéd heavy rock opening music. I think this interview extract (originally from Violet Veil magazine) humorously demonstrates just how far of the mark Carpenter's judgement was with this film: Interviewer: ""In the Mouth lightly satirised the horror genre, but did you also do that with the music? The opening number has a very heavy metal feel"" JC: ""What you do when you're screening for audiences you put temporary music on, when you don't have it done. And we put on Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' and the whole audience, their heads were bobbing and I said 'You know what, why don't we start the movie with something like that?' So one of my pals Dave Davies (the lead guitarist from the Kinks) wrote the song. It was a great way to get the movie going, it gets you cranked, it gets you going!"" The fact Carpenter thought a limp, public domain doppelganger track would have a similar affect to the biggest ever metal band's most famous song pretty much sums up the level of competence, or lack thereof, on show. The genre references and instances of dark humour are too few and far between for the film to be considered a send up, and the horror is far too anaemic for it be straight. The globally poor standard of acting on show does little to help matters. Horror fans may find the less usual elements and Lovecraft flavour worth watching for, less passionate viewers should dust off a copy of Halloween, The Thing, or even Prince of Darkness (1987) before resorting to slumming it in the mouth of mediocrity.",In the Mouth of Madness

Charlton Heston almost snatches the entire show with just his presence on the screen, but is almost forgotten thanks to the total bizzareness of this film.

198,flimsfromthecrypt,A Lovecraftian Tour De Force,9,2 November 2021,"Unsettling, intelligent, witty and thought-provoking. John Carpenter's 1994 flim in The Mouth of Madness takes a look at the thin line between reality and fiction, as it points the finger back at the viewer, asking us how real the worlds and realities we consume in our media really are.Insurance Claims investigator (who comes across more like a detective) John Trent (Sam Neil) goes on the hunt for renowned horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) after he disappears under mysterious circumstances. Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) joins him as the lines between what is real and isn't distort beyond comprehension.A flim that ages very well, Sam Neil is a very likeable character who holds the reins well throughout, capturing the disintegration of Trent's mind masterfully. I wasn't too keen on Julie Carmen's performance as it felt like she was phoning it in most of the time, spare a couple of scenes. Jürgen Prochnow as Cane does a really good job at making Cane a enigma of sorts as we never get a clear reading of how Cane is taking the events of the movie.Ultimately, In The Mouth of Madness is a great pulpy, cosmic horror joyride with hints of black comedy sprinkled throughout to keep the peace that is a timeless classic worth rewatching.",In the Mouth of Madness

Once again Industrial Light and Magic lives up to their reputation ( famous for their work on Star Wars, Back to the Future and T2) and create mind-blowing visual effects that almost seem real enough to jump out of the television set.

I actually tend to avoid it because I am easily scared, and I don't like being scared, but I love Lovecraft because for me his stories and his imagination are very evocative and intriguing and very fascinating too, and I also love Araki's work because I just love the bizarre, and this movie is 100% Lovecraft except Lovecraft has never been that bizarre, completely messed up, absurd and plain crazy. This movie is 200% madness, at firts it seems normal and maybe a bit boring too (it is on purpose, of course) but things escalate really quickly and this movie becomes the funniest and wildest rollercoaster ride in the territory of fantasy and darkness.
I think that this movie is not too scary, but maybe it is just because I really hate reality, and reality is the real ""victim"" in this movie.
Watching the movie it is clear that the main chasracter will never be in real danger... well, at least his body is not. It is the whole world around him that gets completely twisted, destroyed and blown up during the entire movie until in the end he don't even know ""what"" he or any other human being in the ""real"" world is, and for me this feels more intriguing and entertaining than scary.
In my opinion the gore is rather tame too, I usually cannot stand gore and violence but there is not so much that makes the movie too hard to watch in my opinion.
Some scenes are actually creepy, some of them became even creepier after I watched the movie several times, but overall in my opinion this movie is just very enjoyable, and every scene that was creepy also somehow felt cool at the same time, so cool that it ends up being really enjoyable.
I know that many horror fans like this movie too, but I write this review for people like me who are not into horror that much but love fantasy, love weird stuff, and don't like reality that much, I suggest you to give this movie a try because in my opinion you could really love it.

It's a film that contains some good freakishness in it as well as some genuine horror. A generally one of it's kind film you probably won't see anything like it. Just the fact that it's not really comparable to those classic horror films like Halloween or Friday the 13th. Which you can't beat, those are great films of their own.

I think I came across writing this review by listening to the soundtrack and inspired by the opening theme for the film. Sam Neill is superb and Julie Carmen still has that look in her eye and gives off the scent since the great 80s sequel Fright Night. The scene of the guy on the bike with the long white hair was creepy and wouldn't fancy passing him during the day let alone at night, there are a few memorable moments and maybe stay with you but not hauntingly.

I was incredibly disappointed in this film, simply because it had such a good plot, but it failed miserably. The movie was weird, dumb, and very boring at times, and outside of the guy who played Kent, the acting was bad. One of my favorite scenes is when they are in the car on the way to the town. I found myself in disbelief because Kent would barely look at the road while driving. It is little things like that which make the movie so lame. Please, do not waste your time watching this movie.

Lovecraft is actually credited by Carpenter as the inspiration for In The Mouth of Madness, not to mention several of his other films. As a stand alone film, I find the plot to be bizarre and incomprehensible, but as an elucidation of Lovecraft's vision it was right on the mark.Order and sanity were not requisite components of Lovecraft's fiction, and you won't find them in this film either. The enduring suspicion throughout is that humans may be merely the temporal pawns of ""the old ones;"" god-like beings that hilariously delude humans into worshipping them. Also like Lovecraft's work, there is a serious thread of humor running through the film. Underlying the gore and confusion, there is a comical, nearly academic compulsion to examine existential questions. The incongruous mix of profundity and silliness makes this movie unbalancing and more than a little funny.

Every movie that deals with the human psyche, if it is done successfully, can cause that (see Jacob's Ladder). But this movie has something different going on here and can only be observed if you see the patterns emerging. This is a movie about the nature of reality. It could be seen like a horror interpretation of Plato's Cave analogy. The main character seems trapped into this reality, forced unto him by the Godlike powers of the Writer. In the scene inside the church where they talk, Sutter Cane tells him that the only thing necessary for something to become reality is belief. Even if there is denial and resistance to it, it is still a belief. In other words, we see the struggle of a man, who feels trapped into a horrifying novel, determined by forces outside of him. He wants to get out, but he can't and the reason is belief. The ending seems mysterious, but it closes the movie with the right way. Going into the theater, as a guest and watching the movie of his life. He cries and then he laughs. He realized that everything was in his head. Just a movie playing and the stronger he believed in it, the more real it became. Of course, there is subtle humor from everyone involved and can be seen in their performances.

Carpenter builds the suspense beautifully, Sam Neil gives one of his greatest performances ever, and Heston is terrific, even though his part is short. The only downside is that the visual effects are REALLY lousy.The storyline and the characters are more complex and interesting that the ones in 'The Thing' but Carpenter doesn't handle them as well as he does in The Thing. Bottomline: The Thing is scarier, but In the Mouth of Madness is cool, because it is much stranger, suspenseful and has better performances than its predecessor.I won't go into the plot, plenty reviews have done that, but basically the film is about separating reality from fiction and it presents us with the possibility of being just fictional characters in some dream.

Though great Cthulhu himself does not appear in this movie, and John Carpenter still hasn't learned to play the guitar properly, the movie is still absolutely fantastic.The ending itself conveys the basic theme of the cthulhu mythos: You are all equally worthless and your lives are pathetically tiny and insignificant. A non-happy ending, for you who are slow in the uptake.Sam Neill is crazy as always, and the supporting cast is great too. Some of the plastic monsters are somewhat crappy, but mercifully only shown for a few seconds with good scary lighting and sounds.",In the Mouth of Madness

The dark overtones of the movie makes it a classic Carpenter film along the lines of The Thing, Prince of Darkness, and They Live. Where the existence of the human race will only become a fairy tale. The visual effects were decent, but the focus on John Trent (Sam Neill's character) trying to rationalize what is happening with the books written by Sutter Cane and how it begins to effect the public and the plunge into madness and mass hysteria and reports of people turning into monsters. Definitely a film that is a must to see for any horror movie fans out there.",In the Mouth of Madness
238,houndead1979,The closest you can get from a Lovecraft's novel in a movie,10,25 July 2012,"I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.",In the Mouth of Madness

However I sincerely enjoyed this dark, comic and sometimes disturbing little gem. The plot was done in the usual Carpenter-esquire trademark with it's uglier than life anti-heroes trying to survive in an inhospitable environment whilst occasionally spitting out some witty if somewhat corny one-liners. The camera work is what to be expected from the director as is the trademark music that always adds that little extra atmosphere to his movies. The one thing that makes In the Mouth of Madness unique to John Carpenter's other films is the connection to a certain Lovecraft Mythos. This film has a strong sub plot of the weakness of the protagonist's sanity. You have your freaky town with its dark secrets and mutating indigenous population and not to mention the tonnes of tentacles thrown into the mix. All in all I really enjoyed the movie, but if you disagree then try a Barbera Streisand flick, that's sure to scare you!",In the Mouth of Madness

Lovecraft. Loosley based upon The case of Charles dexter ward, with bits of Stephen king thrown in for good measure. Carpenter pulls out all of his toys with this hypnotic visceral piece of horror mastery. IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is a great movie to watch on a Friday night with a few beers and the light off. Hopefully John Carpenter will be back to form with his new movie next year. Trivia IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is a pun on Lovecraft's AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS. Great film, recommended.

As a little kid, I have watched Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark for years and stepped to the next level by staying up late for Tales from the Crypt and Twilight Zone. Then went to HBO horror specials (in our country they are usually aired in the midnight to dawn). When I watched it first (some scenes were cut by HBO and I had to skip some scenes because I was under the supervision of my nanny who had to cover my eyes because of ""traumatic"" scenes). The second time I watched it was like munching the story gradually until I'd get the real story. It was that time I learned how a horror movie could just make me grow and mature. The movie carefully laid out the facts needed to understand the entire story. There are scenes that are symbolic enough to keep you thinking until the end. The most brilliant part was the book covers and the part where the lady said she ""has read the book till the end"". It's a movie that should be continued or else, remade for the present horror flick lovers.This movie made me realize that there's more treasures in watching classic flicks than the trendy horror movies at present.",In the Mouth of Madness

But I think it's pretty accurate to say that about 8 out of 10 people will enjoy it so that's what I gave it. Another reveiw said that they should have left out the scenes with the author.

But, I must say that there is no REALLY scary part in the film. Not one. I, personally, wouldn't classify this film as 'horror'. Not even a thriller. I think that the worst scene  of the film is when Sam Neil is running down th tunnel, with all the monsters behind him. About as convincing as Alice in Wonderland. In The Mouth Of Madness does not boast spectacular FX, I mean, the monsters seem cheap and floppy but that isn't what the film is about. It's about insanity. It's about us humans in general. It made me think about The Matrix in it's faulty views of reality. The acting is good, most notably Sam Neil does a good job. These are the kind of movie's that make people really go insane.

No need to say something about acting cause it's SAM NEILL. No other scenario can be so fascinating.It catches you from the beginning and hold you jumpy to the end. Usually horror films have ordinary endings but this one is also different by its surprising end. I can't compare it with any other films cause it is matchless.

A spooky takeoff of the works of H.P. Lovecraft will likely give you the willies for the rest of the night, and may cause you to question your role in the grand scheme of existence. The special effects weren't bad, really, considering how cheesy they had the potential to be. The movie lacks the ""splatter"" of other horror films, but brief partial nudity and some profanity render this one unfit for the kiddies. Adults with weak minds probably shouldn't watch, either, as they may think too much and accidentally set their own heads on fire.",In the Mouth of Madness

Sure, they have some value for being something that you don't see in every movie, but, unfortunately, the movie, at the same time, takes itself way too seriously and not seriously at all.

It's a shame we haven't seen any more movies like this.But one thing though, didn't this movie go through a name change??? I think it was under another name when I saw it.

It's just a big joke with a punchline at the end.A bestselling author Sutter Cane (like Stephen King) whose books make people have strange experiences, is writing a novel called In the Mouth of Madness. The main character unknowingly enters into the author's story and he sees ""horryfiyng things"".The entire movie just shows supposedly creepy or horrifying scenes in quick succesion (sometimes the same scene would be shown about four times). Also the movie fails horribly in creating atmosphere which is what Lovecraftian tales are about, not just mentioning that the world will end or showing Cthulhu-like monsters (which by the way I think their appearance is the only good point). Overall they take the Lovecraft name and style for granted and is a shame for the Cthulhu mythos.",In the Mouth of Madness
253,tacamaral,"A very good movie, often overlooked",8,24 March 2013,"In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart.The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane.I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself.Three of the actors – Sam Neill, Jürgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house – simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part.The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying ""horrors beyond imagining"", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort.Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares – the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected.But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock – if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing (""We've only just begun"", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line ""Sorry about the balls – it was a lucky shot"" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: ""Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy."" As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural.All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.",In the Mouth of Madness
