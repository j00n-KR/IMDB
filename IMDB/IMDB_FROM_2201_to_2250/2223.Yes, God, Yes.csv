0,SnoopyStyle,salad spinner,6,14 September 2021,"It's the early 2000's in conservative middle America. Catholic school student Alice (Natalia Dyer) is struggling with lust in an environment of sexual repression. A rumor spreads about her and a salad. She gets involved in an AOL sex chat. She goes on a religious retreat where she is surrounded by lies including her own.It's a bit of a struggle with this character. I think it's the sex chat addiction. She needs to stop and I'm glad the lesbian said it. Also, I would have liked for her to come clean about the bracelet but that may be asking too much. She doesn't have to admit to the chat but she did Wade dirty. She should at least let him off the hook even if he's a douche. At the end of the day, this character is far from perfect and that's probably the exact point of the movie. It's a good point. I do wish for more sophistication with the drama. It feels like a simplistic telling. The story feels thin when the subject matters is so deep. It's fine.","Yes, God, Yes"
1,kosmasp,Omg anyone?,7,10 February 2021,"Anyone very religious already has an issue with the movie. I'm fairly certain that they are not detached from reality/this world we are living in and can puzzle together that the title of the movie is an indication that the main character is up to no good ... well according to their defintion of good that is.Because obviously certain things feel really good. And those are the things catholic girls are not supposed to find out about. Also it is not very Christian to learn things like toss my salad - which do not take the word of the person first explaining it to our main actress. He (?) is teasing her - I put a question mark there, because we obviously don't know due to the anonymity of the internet.Having said all that, this may be a bit spicy and racy but not to a great degree. This is more a personal journey sort of thing. Discovering, learning stuff along the way. Also peeping on other people, using certain objects in ways they were not meant to be used ... although, maybe I am wrong and a broom ... but see for yourself, if you are not easily offended or overly religious","Yes, God, Yes"
2,paul_haakonsen,"Well, this is aimed at a very select audience...",4,15 August 2020,"I must admit that I was expecting more comedy from ""Yes, God, Yes"", but it was more heavy on the drama side. Which, I found a bit disappointing, because I had hoped to be entertained by a comedy, and not by a coming of age movie.With that said, I should also say that ""Yes, God, Yes"" is not actually a bad movie. It just failed to strike home with me, because my expectations were elsewhere. The movie definitely would find a base with a large audience out there, readily expecting the drama and coming of age approach. I assume young teenage girls with heavy religious backgrounds would definitely find appeal in this movie, given its storyline and plot.I will say that the cast in the movie were performing quite well. And lead actress Natalia Dyer definitely carried the movie a long way with her performance as Alice.However, I was only mildly entertained by what writer and director Karen Maine managed to dish out with this 2019 movie titled ""Yes, God, Yes"".My rating lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. I managed to sit through the entire movie, but I fell short of the target audience, so I wasn't really overly entertained or enjoying the movie. And this is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.","Yes, God, Yes"
3,evanston_dad,Moderately Engaging But Underdeveloped,6,10 November 2020,"A moderately engaging but underdeveloped movie about a teenage girl who's horny as all get out but is being brainwashed by her Catholic community to believe that everything to do with sex is bad.The movie points out the hypocrisy rampant among religious people (a righteous priest and leader of the Jesus camp the girl attends is seen watching porn in his office), but it lacks teeth. The main character remains too subdued to be truly effective. I have a feeling the filmmaker was trying to keep it real and make the character believable as a timid teenager who's only tentatively flirting with rebellion. But the whole movie revolves around her and its success depends on us wanting to see her put a bunch of phonies in their place, which never really happens to the extent that would have made the movie truly satisfying.The film's best moment is a scene between the main character and a lesbian she meets at a bar who gives her a little bit of world wisdom.Grade: B","Yes, God, Yes"
4,siderite,The Miseducation of Natalia Dyer,8,1 April 2021,"If you watched The Miseducation of Cameron Post, this film is almost identical, only much more about hypocrisy and no lesbianism. The Kirkos christian retreat depicted in the film actually exists, only it's called Kairos, and the story in the movie seems to be rooted at least partially in an actual experience. I was really expecting this to have been a book adaptation, just like Cameron Post, but it wasn't.Now the film is pretty good. I don't think they could have found a better lead than Natalia Dyer, of Stranger Things fame, as she seems to be the kind of girl that got forward in life by furrowing her brows and looking innocent. I mean, there is a scene when she claims to be 21 to get a drink in a bar and no one believes her, which I found hilarious as she's 24 in the film. Basically the whole premise of the movie is that most people are hypocritical, expecting from others what they themselves don't do. It's a whole film of people being phony, spreading lies, using terms they don't understand and then the actual ""climax"" is not the last scene, which was kind of pointless really, it was the bar scene, where the bar owner and the Christian schoolgirl exchange ridiculous Catholic reasons why they thought they're going to hell.Bottom line: a film that is direct in depiction, but subtle in character emotions and development. Perfect casting choice for the lead and most acting was very good. Overall, a better than average film. I liked it better than The Miseducation of Cameron Post, to which it resembles way too much.","Yes, God, Yes"

6,westsideschl,What a Stew to Be In,8,12 November 2020,"In a teen simplistic way we're shown that point in life where social pressures, establishing your identity, and sex are topped with religious (Catholic in this case) educational, moral & faith pressures. I thought the script was fairly balanced between religious doctrine, and its fallible proctors as counterpoint to restraining human biology.","Yes, God, Yes"
7,ops-52535,a sassy little cutie...,8,3 August 2020,"On an antisex catholic camp, where they learn that spilling the seeds to barren ground and filling the womb with other things than a baby, or taking a walk on the wild side of the bush, threading the salat in front of god and everyone, thats a very nice recipie for a comedy that all of us neutral believers that doesnt live stringent religous lives can laugh of. this is my summary.its glitchfree in the act, the musical score are chosen with great care and underlines and protrudes the haresment of the sexual hypocracy that was and are today in i guess every dire religous order, in this case the catholic world.if i , the grumpy old man, still smiling from the thought of recommending this to my wife , had had a hand on forming the script i would have made it more juicier in word and action, but for the pretenscious this is far beyond the limit of good conduct anyway, so have a look, hands cuffed behind your back, because this is spankingly erotic and good fun. recommended","Yes, God, Yes"

9,jtindahouse,Brings up some interesting ideas but never pulls the trigger with an opinion on them,6,12 November 2020,"I wish I knew the prospective of filmmaker Karen Maine's vision with 'Yes, God, Yes'. Even though I detest the 2014 film 'God's Not Dead', I at least firmly knew where I stood with it. In this case though I wasn't really sure whether she was taking a pro-religion stance, an anti-religion stance or simply a neutral stance. If I had to guess I'd probably go with the last one, but there were elements to the story that gave me hope that she was trying to show the faulty side of religion and how it can ruin the way people live their lives. I was glad she showed how hypocritical almost every character in the film was.I feel like 'Yes, God, Yes' was having trouble deciding what it wanted to be. At times it feels like it is going for laughs, other times it goes for deep and meaningful and other times it feels like it's trying to get a point across. The problem is that it never really commits to any of these concepts and so ultimately it just drifts along and will be gone from my memory by this time tomorrow I suspect. There was nothing this film had to offer that will stick with me.I didn't hate the film though. It is very short at only 87 minutes so at least it can never be said it outstays its welcome. It does bring up some interesting discussion topics even though I feel like I had to do the leg work in terms of the actual thinking on them for the most part. As I said, this film can kill 87 minutes for you, but don't expect too much else.","Yes, God, Yes"
10,billcr12,Good Concept,8,31 December 2020,"As someone who had experience with Catholic school for my first six years in the 1960's, I could appreciate the story of a girl struggling with the concept of sin and hypocrisy. Natalia Dyer is a sixteen year-old girl who comes across a chat room online and acts upon her feelings of lust; one of the seven deadly sins, of course, and one which would send you to the fires of hell. George Carlin did a routine on impure thoughts and this continues in that vain. Dyer stays at a four day Catholic retreat with constant lectures by a priest who is not so pure himself. This is not an anti-Catholic film in any respect. It only shows the difficulty for all of us in dealing with sin and our personal failings as human beings. I can pray the Rosary every day and still have a problem with the Church of Rome and their rules. Meanwhile, Yes, God, Yes is an excellent film.","Yes, God, Yes"

12,kwenchow,"This is definitely not a comedy film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!",1,10 August 2020,"This film start with the introduction of the term ""salad tossing"", and a female student ""Alice"" talking with her teacher scene! As turnout, this film is about Alice obsess with masturbation, after chatting online with an unknown person! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the close-up facial scene, overuse of the dreaming of holding hand scene, overuse of the chatting online scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the on screen singing scene, overuse of the cleaning scene, and overuse of the boring speech scene! Make the film unwatchable! Don't expect nude scene from the main actress! Certainly won't have! At the end, Alice confess she watching people copulate! She back to her house watching tape! That's it! Wasting time to watch!","Yes, God, Yes"
13,arthur_tafero,"Much Better Than Average Coming of Age Film - Yes, God, Yes",7,27 October 2020,"I liked this film because it examined the obvious hypocrites involved in extra-curricular religious activities. And that goes across the board for all religions and all extra-curricular religious activities, such as retreats and the like. The film is quite funny, and the lead actress does a great job, as do all of the supporting actors. But the real star here is the writer and director (who obviously went to a Parochial School, as I myself did). I can relate to the onerous cloud of guilt that is perpetuated by the religious zealots of all religions. It is a common denominator. The coming (literally) of age sexually is a very commonplace occurrence, and is within the natural order of things; however religion somehow tries to deny nature at every turn. I thought the two funniest scenes were the chocolate pudding lid licking and the oven/microwave metaphor for girls and boys by the cleric. Good stuff and not to be missed.","Yes, God, Yes"

15,jfgibson73,Sent to Bible Camp,6,13 April 2021,This was a fun comedy. I liked Natalia Dryer's performance. She play a girl who gets a reputation because of a rumor. She is sent to Bible camp and at first tries to follow what she is being taught. Then she slowly starts to find out that not everyone is what they seem. There is a lot more going on behind the scenes.,"Yes, God, Yes"

17,I_Ailurophile,Unexpectedly fantastic,9,8 April 2021,"Adapted from the 2017 short film of the same name, I didn't anticipate 2019's 'Yes, god, yes' to necessarily be as worthwhile. Taking time to watch it nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised - this is a wonderful little movie.It's a gamble to adapt a short film into a full-length feature, even when the same writer and director has their hand in both. The simple punch that makes a 5-10 minute picture impactful can be easily diluted or even lost in trying to expand its breadth. I am so pleased to say that in Karen Maine's hands, 2019's 'Yes, god, yes' beats the odds and is a true joy to watch.Natalia Dyer once again stars, lighting up the screen in her portrayal of protagonist Alice. Just as in the short, she so believably conveys Alice's shock, confusion, uncertainty - and bliss. With the additional themes and characters added to the full-length feature, Dyer is also given still more to work with - we get to see Alice's anger, and hurt, and at last, her vindication and resolve.The core of the full-length follows on its predecessor's underpinnings. Waves of nostalgia wash over us as innocent ponderings lead from curiosity to self-discovery; as clear conflict builds between healthy, natural inclinations and strict social codes that restrict us to the point of toxicity; as the fraud and false piety of our would-be role models and saviors is exposed. Given a longer duration to build a narrative, Maine expands upon these story beats, and adds to them.The stubbornly stoic, regimented, and insulated and controlled upbringing so many of us shared in the Catholic church, or in religion broadly, is inspected with an even more keen eye. It's hard not to read a satirical bent in the 2019 screenplay that was much less present in the short: Alice's daily life at a Catholic high school, the attitudes of her peers and the instruction by personnel, is too ridiculous to be true. But having grown up Catholic, we know there's no parody here - it's just rote repetition, and thusly even more ridiculous. To the extent that 'Yes, god, yes' boasts the feel of satire, it's only because the camera plainly observes what we all saw and experienced in childhoods under Catholic auspices.The nostalgia built into the short was centered around AOL's reach in our lives and Alice's beloved VHS tape of 'Titanic,' dating those 11 minutes to the early 2000s. So it is here, too, but we also watch Alice playing Snake on her Nokia Tracfone (talk about a blast from the past). And the sense of recollection is further reinforced as the full-length screenplay further hones in on high school life: It's brutal, with false rumors, disbelieving adults, and gossiping classmates surrounding us on all sides. Not everyone had the same nasty experience Alice does - at least, not to the same extent - but, golly, does this feel familiar.There are points where 2019's 'Yes, god, yes' feels like it begins to falter, and flag, but then another moment is injected into the narrative that sharply pulls back our attention. No few of these moments are further instances of Alice's self-discovery and sexual awakening, certainly more than what the short was able to convey. To be sure, this movie is not rated PG - but at all times it aims for laughs, nostalgia, and empathy, not arousal and titillation. The subject matter is a bit salacious, but the content is not.I alluded to the simple punch that 2017's short film boasted, briefly following Alice's exploration with wit and comedy. That aspect of those 11 minutes is diluted over the 78 minutes of the 2019 full-length picture, but not lost. What we get in return is a more complete character arc: Alice is growing up, and she experiences much of that growth in a few short days that show her the hypocrisy of her fellows, the limits of her faith, and the sense of personal identity she begins to build all the while and amidst her self-discovery. 'Yes, god, yes,' as a full-length film, becomes a coming of age story, but it's one that far exceeds the often blasé observations of much of the genre. We readily identify and empathize with Alice, feeling very acutely every bit of shock, hurt, and curiosity she does. In a funny and heart-warming scene towards the end, Alice steps back from the retreat she is on and has an earnest, eye-opening conversation with an older woman who recognizes herself in the 16-year old. As the film begins to wrap up, we laugh and cheer as Alice takes a stand for herself, claims a sense of self, and progresses forward to the life she wants.I honestly had some low expectations before I watched this. We've seen similar stories play out before, and again, the 2017 short film was such a delight that I found it hard to imagine a longer version could keep up. I'm very glad I was wrong.Filmmaker Karen Maine, and incredible young star Natalia Dyer, have now given us two outstanding pictures that feel very personal and very familiar: one extra short, but funny and impactful; the other far longer (but still relatively short), but no less funny or impactful, and perhaps even more actively engaging. 2017's 'Yes, god, yes.' was a very fun watch. 2019's 'Yes, god, yes' is just as fun, but for different reasons.A fantastic feature, well worth watching. No doubt some will find a way to take offense, and it won't be for everyone, but I love it and happily recommend it to anyone who may be curious.Two thumbs up!","Yes, God, Yes"
18,arungeorge13,"I liked it for what it is, even though not particularly memorable! [+62%]",6,29 July 2020,"Karen Maine's Yes, God, Yes won me over for its slice of 2000s nostalgia and the way it portrayed some very relatable things in the lives of teenagers of those times. The story is a little too simplistic, and it doesn't try to bite off more than it can chew. In that sense, the film's climax probably won't seem too revolutionary when viewed in 2020 where 'sinning' is more of an innuendo than something religious.There are some predictable turns, there are some funny moments, there's a little sexual exploration (something the film could have dwelled more on, given its theme), and there's a neat central performance from Natalia Dyer. For a 25-year-old playing a high-school teenager, I really enjoyed her adorable facial expressions for the most part. The film's only 77 minutes long, so it doesn't take up much of your time in telling a straightforward, unsurprising story.","Yes, God, Yes"

21,Jeremy_Urquhart,"While not bad, it was a letdown",5,7 August 2020,"Disappointing that it's sort of just another coming of age movie, taking the tropes and side characters that you usually see in those movies and using them pretty ordinarily here. With the premise it had, I really wish it had been funnier, crazier, edgier, or just a little less predictable.It falls into that annoying category of dramadies where it's neither particularly funny or particularly dramatic (I call it Entourage Syndrome, named after how lazy that show could be when it frequently didn't commit to either comedy or drama).Most of the performances are okay, and the brief length keeps it from being too dull, but it was a slight disappointment, even if not bad.Oh: and it doesn't capture the time period nearly as well as something like Ladybird. Sorry to compare it to that, but overall that was a much faster, funnier, more emotional, and far better paced movie in general.","Yes, God, Yes"
22,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,I genuinely liked this film alot,8,24 August 2020,"I hadn't anticipated watching this title, but there wasn't much else on so I gave it a try. I genuinely ended up liking it a lot. Mostly because this is one of the few films that gets Catholicism right so I can only imagine their must have been some real Catholics in the production of this film.I grew up Catholic and I attended parochial school in the middle school years and I could certainly identify with some of these characters. i can only imagine some people who aren't Catholics might not get all of the jokes.Best advice Alice received from this four day re treatment camp, go to college on the east or west coast. Otherwise the Catholic guilt trip and burning in hell psychology can seriously mess you up as an adult.","Yes, God, Yes"
23,Sir_AmirSyarif,A lot of buildup with no real follow through,6,26 October 2020,"Combining coming-of-age themes with perspectives on institutional hypocrisy, 'Yes, God, Yes' often feels a little too simplistic on its story for its own good - like there isn't enough substance within the narrative to allow the commentary to have the impact that it should. A lot of buildup with no real follow through. Natalia Dyer gives a wonderful performance and carries the film all the way through.","Yes, God, Yes"
24,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Jesus is always watching"" Just not this movie",5,20 December 2020,"This is meant to be a ""Comedy/Dark Comedy"" movie according to Netflix weird category system. This movie isn't funny in the same way as a typical comedy there aren't any actual scenes that contain any real comedy in them or are really intended to make people laugh. Now don't get me wrong this movie will make you laugh but because of how relatable the situations and characters are throughout the movie especially if you grew up in a particularly strict, religious environment where you were taught that everything apart from breathing and praising Jesus is a sin.","Yes, God, Yes"
25,0w0,Insanely short and not funny or memorable,5,11 December 2020,"The story is supposed to be about a girl who discovers her sexuality at a christian camp, but what happens in the end is she humps a broom a bit and uses her phone's vibrating feature on herself for all of 15seconds... There's nearly no kissing, no fondling, no sex, and then the movie ends. I just thought they left SO MUCH unexplored with this topic and the fact that the movie is barely over 70 minutes long doesn't help at all. How was this girl supposed to explore her sexuality if the viewer barely couldn't even explore the movie theater in the running time of the film... so overall, it's WAY too short and the subject matter isn't hardly explored. 5/10.","Yes, God, Yes"

27,ronakkotian,Didn't get much out of it...,5,2 May 2021,"The premise sounded interesting but I wanted more out of it.Yes, God, Yes follows Alice, a Catholic teenager that discovers masturbation as an AOL chat gets sexual but feels conflicted about the act as it would be considered a sin.With this film, director Karen Maine brings to light some interesting ideas about religion and sexual discovery. The film expressed interesting ideas in regards to sexual awakening through Alice's perspective as we learn and see the hypocritical nature of the very people that teach her the moral way to live. I did like the satirical and comedic approach Maine took with the story as it made for some funny moments. The performances are fine but Natalia Dyer really stands out here. She manages to convey the conflict between her character's innocence and someone who doesn't know how to feel about her sexual discovery really well which anchors a lot of the Yes, God, Yes' comedy. Whilst the film is very short in length, I don't think Maine explored this topic in as much detail as it could've been. It tells its story in a simplistic way which I felt hindered the possibility to delve deeper into the subject matter and by the end I didn't really get much out of it.Yes, God, Yes had a lot of potential and there were parts to appreciate but I was left somewhat underwhelmed by the experience. Natalia Dyer was great but I found the film to be pretty forgettable.","Yes, God, Yes"

Director: Karen Maine
Starring: Natalia Dyer, Francesca Reale, Alisha Boe, John Henry Ward, Donna Lynne Champlin, Wolfgang Novogratz etcOverall rating 79/100Yes, God Yes is based off an innocent catholic teenager called Alice who gets into a racy online conversation with a stranger, and after a rumour of her having sex with someone else materialises she goes to a catholic retreat to try and find herself. I thought Yes God Yes was very good and different to a lot of comedies with its themes and cleverness, so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, there was an interesting concept, likeable main character and performance, as well as the movie being very funny. I thought the whole religion aspect of the movie was really unique and added a fun new perspective to previously explored sexual themes from previous comedies. The main character was very likeable as well as the main performance from Natalia Dyer, lice had such a likeable innocence and charm to her that made you instantly connect with her, Natalia Dyer also bought the character to life excellently, with a versatile performance and the kind of charm and likeability that made me not take my eyes off her, she stole every scene she was in. The movie was also very funny, the amount of hilarious but often relatable awkward situations that the characters were put through were great, there was some funny visual metaphors, as well as completely contradictory characters in terms of what they were teaching about religion that was very funny and executed well.My first two negatives however would be the generic high school formula and the lack of explanation into certain plot points. I thought the film did sadly follow the very generic and corny high school formula throughout with no real attempt to be different from that, there was the generic split friendship groups and unneeded conflicts it was a shame due to the other unique parts to the movie. I also thought that there was a lack of explanation into certain plot points, I thought that one of the key plot points t hat were used throughout the movie about the rumour of Alice and a male student was not well explained, it was a clear example of telling us a detail but not showing us, therefore it loses it's importance and impact despite it being such a big part of the movie.My next few positives would be the charm between the characters, good themes explored as well as balancing of religious and non religious themes. All the cast had excellent chemistry with each other which was great, Natalia Dyer and Francesca Reale had fantastic on screen chemistry and how their friendship developed throughout was well done, Wolfgang NovoGratz was also great and played his role with other characters very well. The film also had well explored themes about religion. I actually learned some things about religion that I didn't know before which was both interesting and almost concerning in parts, but learning about the sexual sacrifices they have to make and what they considered sins was well explored and really interesting to me, but also the themes of still being religious but not as hardcore in terms of following all the rules was interesting and more reflective of how religion is viewed in todays society, and on that note they balanced these clashing themes and views very well to give both ways a voice throughout the movie.My final couple of negatives would be the questionable character decisions as well as some generic and lazily set up plot points. I thought the main character of Alice did make a couple of questionable decisions that made her slightly unlikeable in places, there was just a few better ways that her character could of handled certain situations in places. I also found that there was generic and lazily set up plot points that didn't work that well, I thought other characters putting the blame on other people to get out of situations was very generic of parts of this genre and was lazily handled in places which was a shame.My final few positives however would be the script, clever parts to the plot linking to the themes and character arc of the main character and the ending. The script was excellent and told this coming of age story excellently, with some in depth and well thought out dialogue that really made you think which was excellent especially when Alice met Susan Blackwells character. I also thought the clever titles of the movie for different days cleverly represented Alice's character arc of finding herself and accepting that she wasn't a complete catholic was excellent and fantastically well done. And finally, the ending was very satisfying, I thought they ended all the characters relationships and arcs very well and the true message that the movie was trying to express was delivered excellently.Overall, despite the script and creative choices making the film not quite as good as it should be in places. Yes, God yes is a clever and mostly unique kind of comedy that's boosted by an excellent main performance from Natalia Dyer and plenty of laughs along the way.","Yes, God, Yes"
30,thebricks,"Not terrible, but Catholic school is nothing like this",7,16 August 2020,"Went to Catholic school most of my school years. There were a lot of inaccuracies, but overall, the vibe is on point. You can be a bit sheltered there compared to public schools. Most students however are not devout religious zealots. It's very cliquey, there is a lot of racism and classism. It's a cagey environment. There is a lot of bullying. I can see whoever made it probably never has ever been to a Catholic school. They transposed what would be a Baptist or Mormon school with a Catholic school. Maybe even one of those modern Evangelical churches. The father, especially for the late nineties, is way too young and hip. They're not like that. Most are very by-the-book and stodgy. I never once was offered to go on a retreat nor did anyone think it was cool.There was an odd scene near the end where a lesbian character in a bar tells Alice all of her issues will be solved if she goes to a college on the West or East Coast. Which is just absolutely stupid. Alice is not LGBT, she's VERY conservative and obedient to authority. Someone like her, with her Catholic school upbringing, would not like to live in a very liberal area. The whole scene was just an example of bad writing. Why was this character even back in the Midwest if she loved San Francisco so much?Anyways, it's a good watch, surprisingly wholesome despite some of the more taboo material. Other than that idiotic bar scene which seemed like a timid attempt at propaganda, this was actually an alright watch.","Yes, God, Yes"
31,nammage,Quiet Repose,6,23 October 2020,"I liked the trailer which made me watch the film, and the beginning was good but for a 77 minute film I kept checking to see if it was over yet. It is so boring. There's little to no composition, songs are almost obsolete; I mean, near the end there's a Collective Soul song as the main character gyrates on a mop pole which, I guess it was supposed to be funny but I just found it weird. It moves unnecessarily slow. At first I actually didn't mind as if it were building up to something and it kind of does, like the utter hypocrisy of those who spout one thing but do the opposite but the punches (punchline) were misses as if the person was totally stoned in the concept.I guess after awhile I was looking for quaint but humorous and really all I got was quaint, which, I guess is fine but it's just too little. It does have the 'raunchy' aspects but it didn't seem it was trying to be raunchy. It seemed to be trying to be real, like real life, and maybe it was or is but for the content it really shouldn't have been. People looking for raunchy want raunchy. People looking for feel good typically want that. People typically don't want both entwined together though I did recently see a Canadian raunchy-feel good film but it was Canadian: they're always feel good /facetious.I think it was just too quiet. There just wasn't any excitement when there should have been. It was quite monotonous.","Yes, God, Yes"
32,Rendanlovell,Boilerplate,5,22 August 2020,"On the fence with this one. The film is about a young girl having her sexual awakening while being told by catholics that its a bad thing. Saying that this is reminiscent of other work would be an understatement. There's a lot to it that feels ripped from films like Lady Bird or Miseducation of Cameron Post. The main story not only reminds me other films but the coming of age story at its heart just wasn't that interestingWhich I think boils down to the main character being horribly bland. Her whole purpose is to wander in between scenes and see things. She's an incredibly passive character that probably has less lines then most of the other characters. If the film needs her to see something hypocritical happening they wander her over to observe it. Then people get mad at her and we repeat this cycle over and over again.The film doesn't even reach 90 minutes and it still feels long. There's whole plot lines they have running through the film that we don't get to see the start of. Which means we have no idea what's going on. The whole lead up to the characters going on this catholic youth retreat is so tedious. And it's constantly rehashing the same material.I get it, God doesn't like people being sexual but the people preaching it are doing the opposite of what they teach. Haven't seen this before. It's all incredibly lame or boiler plate. At times so little was going on I would zone out and snap back having missed nothing. No one is particularly likeable (expect biker lady, who is introduced way too late), it's not that insightful on any issue, and everything it does a good job with I've seen done better elsewhere.","Yes, God, Yes"
33,themadmovieman,A charming coming-of-age film with a wonderful message,7,31 July 2020,"A really solid coming-of-age drama that portrays the transition from innocent youth to world-weary adult in stark fashion, Yes, God, Yes blends sobering drama with charming humour and charisma in a short but punchy tale of personal growth and discovery.Combining perspectives on institutional hypocrisy and personal maturing, this is a film with a lot to say, and for the most part, it does a great job. Far from a preachy or even aggressive attack on those it discredits, it's a movie that's genuinely charming, heartfelt and tempered in its approach.Though it might sound like a strange topic for an 'inspiring' film to focus on, our young lead's discovery of the pleasures of masturbation are used as a metaphor for her coming-of-age, and discovery that the world she has been instructed by all her life is not in fact all-knowing.Taking this discovery as a cue for a quiet yet powerful rebellion against her strict Catholic community, she begins to open up to the wider world, as well as to the reality of how hypocritical those who seek to teach her rigid morality act.In that, the film isn't so much of an attack on Catholicism or Catholics themselves, but rather uses the extremes of the religion to showcase how damaging and hypocritical certain practices and ideologies can be on young people.Natalia Dyer gives a wonderful performance that sees her proving convincing both as a sheltered and innocent teenager as well as a quietly rebellious young adult, and it's through her that you really understand the hurtful effects of the hypocrisies of her elders, particularly given how free she becomes once she removes the shackles of her upbringing and begins to fight back.Dyer is funny and charming all the way through, and brings a soft, sweet presence to what could at times have been a very heavy watch. In that, Yes, God, Yes isn't quite as intensely dramatic as The Miseducation Of Cameron Post, which also looks at the consequences of extremist education, but it is just as charismatic and enjoyable as it is hard-hitting.Featuring a pleasant dash of '00s nostalgia too, Yes, God, Yes is a thoroughly enjoyable watch, with buckets of drama and thought-provoking themes taking centre stage over the course of a punchy 78 minutes. The lead performance from Natalia Dyer is wonderful too, and her blend of charisma and dramatic chops gives the film's sobering message an uplifting and even inspiring edge.","Yes, God, Yes"

35,darkreignn,Bitingly satirical and highly enjoyable,9,8 March 2021,"If you've been raised Catholic or evangelical Christian, chances are that ""Yes, God, Yes"" will highly resonate with you. Having been raised Catholic myself, I could relate heavily to this movie and its main character, Alice, played by Natalia Dyer.Natalia Dyer gives a pretty perfect performance here, playing a timid Catholic schoolgirl who is at once questioning her faith and the teachings of the church while simultaneously experiencing a sort of sexual awakening. And in all honestly, there are no two topics more confusing than religion and sex, and watching Alice navigate her way through both of these things made for compelling viewing. Alice attends a Catholic school where faith, and sex, are thick in the air. Priests talk about it and warn of the dangers of premarital intercourse, and ""pious"" students who swear they would never partake in sex before marriage make up rumors about other students, all sexual in nature. Yes, there are few places more sexual than religious schools, as we all know that when something is forbidden, it suddenly becomes more interesting. And Alice, a young, confused girl who is knee-deep in this repressing culture, decided that maybe a weekend religious retreat with her fellow students, priests, and teachers may do her some good. In that way, she was right.""Yes, God, Yes"" wonderfully satirizes Catholicism and Christianity in a way that doesn't upright make fun of true believers. What I enjoyed a lot about this movie was its accurate portrayal of these type of heavily religious people and places - religion seems like more of a fashion statement than a true state of mind at Alice's Catholic retreat, where students sing ""hip"" Christian music, share sob stories where they felt like Jesus was far away from them, confess to priests who ask them how they could improve their relationship with Jesus, and, of course, discuss topics of a sexual nature amongst themselves and the adults at the retreat, all of whom make it sound like having sex will make God write them a one-way ticket to Hell. It's all ridiculous to write out, but if you've ever been in that type of atmosphere before, it's all very accurate. And in that way, ""Yes, God, Yes"" doesn't need to try to make this type of fervent and fanatical Christianity look silly or ridiculous, because it inherently is.So, as you can imagine, there is some comedy here, especially if you have a laissez-faire attitude about religion. More than that, however, there are a lot of surprisingly sweet and tender moments sprinkled throughout. Natalia Dyer gets a lot of time to flex her subtleties, doing a lot of acting with her face, which was very expressive - many times she didn't need to speak, because her facial expressions did the talking. There was also a fantastically romantic scene where she shares a kiss with another student on the retreat, and it was, honestly, a perfect scene for me - from the music that played during this sequence, to the camera movements, to the fantastic editing, lighting, and cinematography at play, I legitimately rewound the scene because of how effective I found it on a romantic level. Karen Maine helms this movie so purposefully that there is hardly a fault to be found on a technical level.To be quite honest, there isn't much that I disliked about this movie, except for the fact that I found it a little too short. I really wish that there was another 30 minutes tacked on this movie, because there was a lot more to be explored in terms of Alice's character and her relationship with her friends, family, and religion as a whole. That said, what we got in ""Yes, God, Yes"" was short and sweet enough that it kept me wanting more, which is always the mark of a great film.","Yes, God, Yes"
36,isantistao,The Film On Christianity & Sexuality The World So Needs!,8,1 October 2020,"Here it is, finally a film exposing the paradoxical nature of christian sexuality, which it does in the most hilarious ways! This movie shows the reality of human sexuality and how conflicting and hypocritical it is to try to put it into the moral box that christianity tries to and fails. As well as showing a lot of other funny aspects of both christianity and human social nature.

But with all the disturbing built up frustration and the type of characters we see this type of stuff speaks volumes for clear underlying mental illnesses for the creators lol. I mean, every film of this type is exactly the same. A girl sees a b. J and lives a boring life then starts fantasying. Meanwhile her friends around her do whatever they please. It's so obvious.

42,babyjaguar,"Yes, God... frustrated in Y2K: A Maine Revisit.",6,16 August 2020,"What's interesting that Natasha Lyonne's performance as a Lesbian teen discovery (1999's But I'm a Cheerleader) was pioneering with a Y2K coming of age story. It takes place during a summer camp, using comedic tropes to discuss teen complexity. Then in 2004 (although not set during a summer camp) Tina Fey's Mean Girls had Lindsay Lohan's teen perseverance, followed by Saved!'s Mandy Moore teen awareness to now, Yes, God, Year's Natalia Dryer's teen model.There are recent teen discovery films Eight Grade, which is truly original and Boy Erased as the dramatic Teen LGBTIA+ film, it hard to say that Yes, God, Yes is that original.But Maine's direction is superb being this is a first full length feature (originating from a 11-12 min. Short). But it's story is not that original giving that in the 2000's there teen girl coming of age, like Bend It Like Beckham and who can't forget America Ferrera performance in Real Women have Curves.This film's nostalgic feel for Y2K era, may get an interest from an aging Millennial, or a curious Gen Zer on what dial-up internet looked like (pre-social media). But the true gold here is the performance of Natalia Dryer, coming strong and loosening up from her Stranger Things fame.Her projected state of innocence really helped this feature, what otherwise would have been a forgotten indie film.","Yes, God, Yes"

47,mycannonball,In the Spirit of Indie Filmmaking,6,27 February 2021,"This film really feels like one of those festival hits that plays best in the festival setting. It addresses some interesting things around religion and sex, and the main character is likeable. It's a bit slow at times though. Worth a watch, but it's going to appeal most to fans of indie and arthouse films or perhaps someone who has left the Catholic faith and deeply relates to the topic.","Yes, God, Yes"
48,stefstars,Funny Little Gem,6,26 October 2020,"I went to catholic school from elementary up to high school. I did the many retreats like the one in the movie. Just like the film portrays, those retreats get wild and all kind of hell breaks loose cos at the end of the day we were all teenagers. I don't remember anyone taking it as seriously as Alice's friend though. The retreat is done so well in this film, everything from the real ones is here. The story sharing, the songs playing, the girls crying with whatever story they've shared - I laughed at how well they presented it, brought back so many memories.Natalia Dyer is perfectly casted as the main character. She has the perfect facial expressions that illustrate the inner confusion happening to this poor (but clever) high school girl. She gives a great performance. In terms of the story, the rumor made up about the main character comes out of nowhere. The way the film starts off, we're made to believe that Alice's sexual urges are the main point of the story and what will drive whatever whacky events follow, but we're hit out of nowhere with a raunchy rumor being spread about Alice and a boy in her classroom. That rumor then is at the center of everything that goes on afterwards, which was really random. However this showed another accurate depiction of the Catholic school experience with how both the teachers and the priest are aware of the rumor going around and guilt trip Alice about it, that does happen. Although in my high school they were more subtle, middle school though, those frustrated women were vicious - like the teacher shown in the film. It feels like even the movie forgets about the rumor sometimes and bring it back up when it's convenient. I feel like the plot could've done without the rumor, I know it sets up for when Alice innocently uses the priest's computer to find out about the supposed act she partook in at the party, but that's minor to the big discovery she makes of the priest and what he does with his free time on the computer. Those major events are set up by her sneakily keeping her cellphone instead of giving it to her group leader. The rumor just felt unnecessary, could've done without it and the ongoing ""salad tossing"" joke. Another random thing was making the film take place in the early 2000's. It did make me feel nostalgic, especially hearing the AIM noises, but I didn't get the point as to why that decision was made ? This story could've worked in a present day setting too, so I didn't get the point of that.The movie isn't perfect but it is really funny. It has a great message about how at the end of the day ""we're all figuring our 'stuff' out"" we just have to be respectful of one another and not judge each other for our actions or mistakes. The message that every Catholic school kid should take away, since we got to see firsthand the contradictions in Catholicism but we know faith is one thing, fake fanaticism is another. Worth a watch.","Yes, God, Yes"
49,HanShotFirstGR,"Great potential, okay-ish execution",6,19 January 2021,"Plot:After an innocent AOL chat turns racy, a Catholic teenager in the early 00s discovers masturbating and struggles to suppress her new urges in the face of eternal damnation.Analysis:With a very interesting idea that looks weird enough to be great, Yes God Yes is a teen comedy that deals with some serious issues about how religion repress people and especially young ones about sex and carnal pleasures. It's a movie that could have been better but eventually remains kinda okay and analyzes a subject that would be a taboo for many people. As human civilization evolves, these medieval moraloty must be questioned more often and that was a very risky but important step for this one.This movie exposes the hypocrisy of this culture of puritanism and shows that everyone's nature isn't something to hide or be embarassed but to accept and be open about it. Sex in our days is a taboo subject and many religions around the world try to keep it that way, but as humanity evolves these stereotypes and ridiculous beliefs are getting less and less popular. Also, a serious issue is that most of the times those who lecture you about sinning for these things are often way less of a saint than you are, they hide and they don't reveal their true selves but they still despise and talk against something they subconsiously accept. All of those things have been covered perfectly in Yes God Yes and that's a great achievment.Natalia Dyer was alson great in this one, she managed to bring out all of the emotions that a young girl feels in this situation. Shame, anger, fear, regret, passion, everything was visible in her reactions and facial expressions, a surprisingly good performance from the young actress. She combined the innocence of a young girl that faces her sexuality for the first time, with the fear and surprise of her first hints of sexual needs and pleasure.Despite those great element it was also a deeply flawed movie. First of all, it wasn't funny, there were some minor parts you could smile a little bit with the silly obvioud jokes but for its entire runtime it will make you think way more than it will make you laugh and that wouldn't be a problem if this wasn't portrayed as a comedy. Also, they wasted this ideas' potential by stalling when they really shouldn't. There were so many directions the story could have followed, from a more serious and shocking truth about corruption, to a funny way of realizing and learning about that. Insted of those, they chose to stall, setting up things that don't actually pay off and have small sparks of humor or scenes that move the plot forward. But the biggest fault of this film is that it's not entertaining at all. It might make you think about that, it might enable your own opinion on these situations so you can fight against this shameful morality, but it will definetely not make you have fun. It's a movie that does some very risky steps forward that cinema needs, but it does it in such a boring way that watching this movie once in already more than enough.Conclusion:Yes God Yes is a brave experiment that gives some clear and valuable messages, but it does it ""the classroom way"", it doesn't give you a nice story around this realization about life, religion and sexuality, it's more like a presentation of all these things through some example incidents and wastes some great potential that could give us one of the best movies of 2019.Rating: 6.5/10","Yes, God, Yes"

53,bgsmall,Amusing 'coming of age' feature length sitcom,7,12 December 2020,"Catholicism always appears to be portrayed in the media as the Christian denomination that emphasizes 'sins of the flesh' (versus other denominations). How true to life (or indeed false) that is, I'm unlikely to ever find out.However, this is a suitable vehicle for the subject of this feature length sitcom. The ever bankable Nathalie Dyer's teen character is torn with lustful thoughts and is persuaded that attending a voluntary weekend 'camp' emphasising clean living and the evils of lust will remedy this.If I were to tell you that the camp certainly doesn't do that, I do hope you're not too suprised. Because many of the central characters are female, the storyline is I think 'gentler' insofar that were this written to portray male characters the script world have been more overt in expressing their desire.

Though you may not get all the jokes if you haven't lived a Christian experience, and maybe that's why the movie doesn't have the highest reviews. The Revelations quote, the Pro-life poster, and moral policing, in the first 15 secs I knew this was a good one. I snorted out loud when I realized I recognized (and could sing certain parts of) the initial hymn song! The movie does have multiple funny parts and has beautiful character development. And don't we all just want to find ourselves?Natalie Dyer (Alice) is the perfect casting for this role, she is the image and likeness of a shy teenage Catholic girl who believes she will burn in hell for re-watching a kiss scene in a movie.

64,AdamDroge,"Conceptually interesting, but messy execution",5,29 October 2020,"I'd heard buzz about this movie from various sources, so I decided to check it out on Netflix. It's about an awkward and shy teen girl going to Catholic school that is Hellfire and Brimstone towards sexuality of any sort outside marriage, but girl is going through a sexual awakening, so we have conflict.Now listen, this has the potential of working out. It's an interesting idea and a challenge that many teens have, especially ones who grew up Christian. But in execution, this is all over the place.The biggest problem is that the filmmakers seem to be more interested in the anti-Catholic sentiments than telling an effective coming of age story. I get it. There's a fine balance that needs to be had in raising teens in a confusing world and many Christian groups aren't the best with their approach. Which is why this premise isn't one that I have a problem with, even though I am a practicing Christian (although not Catholic). But every Catholic leader in their retreat felt so fake. Every time there was a sermon preached, it felt like the writers and actors hadn't ever been to a Sermon. It was super cheesy and awful. It made Christianity sound like a huge joke.Now maybe you are laughing at me. The Christian guy doesn't like the anti-Christian movie. But I just want a good movie. And all the Catholic characters felt fake. And all the teenagers in the movie also felt fake and purposely stereotypical. The only real characters were our main teen, played brilliantly by Natalia Dyer from Stranger Things, and the ex-Catholic lady she talks to at the bar who tells her how awful the Catholic church is. The fact that they were the only two sane characters who felt real made me laugh.So much like all those cheesy Christian movies with horrible acting and predictable storylines (I'm looking at you, PureFlix), this anti-Catholic movie just really misses the mark. I'd rather watch properly done coming of age movies like Eighth Grade where their focus is on making a good movie with real characters. So like I said in my header, conceptually interesting, but messy execution due to lack of focus on what makes these types of movies good.","Yes, God, Yes"

Half Drama Half Comedy it's quite a realistic sensitive take on the subjectIt didn't become an expose on the catholic church or take things to extremes for shock or laughs but it's very respectful and grounded about a very particular experience .It's a swift pace and not longer than it needs to be. it's an enjoyable watch. it's the story of a young girl trying to find her way in an organisation and a world of hypocrisy and Religious Guilt .I wish she had more of a goal in the movie but I think that's part of when your young sometimes you're just exploring .It's not going to change your life but I think it's worth a watch,"Yes, God, Yes"
67,aequanimis,"Nostalgic and Real, but Flawed",6,18 November 2020,"""Yes, God, Yes"" is basically about this 15 or 16-year old girl named Alice who begins experiencing feelings of arousal and struggles with how to reconcile what she feels with her religion. She goes to a Catholic youth retreat to try and find her way back onto the ""path to God"" and hopes that'll help her.As someone who grew up in a strict Catholic household and was fed many of the same sex-ed ""wisdoms"" that Alice encountered, this movie felt like rewatching my early adolescence. Natalie Dyer did really well at portraying a girl grappling with the weird mixture of guilt from one's budding sexuality and the ensuing frustration when people were so quick to judge and condemn you in a religion that preaches tolerance.Overall, this movie was a raw representation of coming-of-age and all the nitty-gritty that it entails. The interactions between characters were, at times, a little extreme as most people in a Catholic environment were not so readily hateful (from my experiences), but I have met all of these characters. I've met the grouchy school administrator. I've met the young, judgmental priest (who always looked weird when he wasn't in a cassock). I've met the ""cool"" youth leaders who were always up to no good when they weren't praising God. I, too, experienced that weird double standard between boys and girl when some unsubstantiated rumor circulated. I even sympathized with Alice rewinding the sex scene in Titanic (except for me, it was a scene in 300). It felt like looking into the mirror and seeing all the things I wanted to forget, but eventually just embraced as a part of my adolescence.It was funny, awkward, and a little uncomfortable, just like growing up usually is. However, one of the reasons I liked this movie was because I related to it. The person I watched it with did not grow up in a religious household and wasn't as impressed, so I think that the nostalgia really plays a role.This movie wasn't perfect. I find that when a short film is adapted into a longer movie, there tends to be lulls in the plot that I don't really encounter in other films. There were times when I would get distracted because there wasn't really a whole lot happening to keep my attention. The scene in the bar with the lesbian bar owner was nice, but felt weirdly forced and a little disingenuous? Like yeah, that's a really easy way for Alice to resolve her guilt: by meeting a wise, older woman who grew up just like her and happened to be within a mile radius of where her retreat was and was willing to dish out some sage advice.Overall, this movie is good. It's cute, but a little forgettable. I might rewatch it in the future, might not.","Yes, God, Yes"

69,MylesWhite,"Yes, God, Yes is Worth Watching 10/10 Stars!!!",10,5 August 2020,"I watched this movie a few weeks ago. I highly recommend everyone to watch this amazing movie. This film is based on a 2017 Short ""Yes, God, Yes"". I love that short was well. Please ignore, the negative reviews on IMDb because it's sadly too opinionated! Natalia Dyer is amazing in this movie. She's one of my favorite actresses. The other actors are amazing as well. The cinematography is simply beautiful. The music is amazing in this movie. I love it. This movie made me realize that everyone has their sexual thoughts and desires. If you're reading this, give this movie a watch because us audiences needs to support more stories like this form the points of view from the female, LGBTQ+, & diverse perspectives. If you don't like this movie give this another watch! We as humans should realize that self pleasure and masturbation is normal! Teenage girls, boys even adults shouldn't feel ashamed to want sexual pleasure. Our society shouldn't be so judgemenal. As a straight man, I don't judge on sexuality. I'm more supportive of diversity and LGBTQ+ stories that should be told. If the cast and crew of Yes, God, Yes reads my review thanks for making an amazing movie!
Yes, God, Yes is a phenomenal, hilarious, inspirational, and beautiful movie. This is one of my favorite movies of 2020! I'm giving this 10/10 stars. Go watch it. NOW!!!!","Yes, God, Yes"
70,eejohnston-56374,I'm Probably Going to Burn in Hell for Recommending This Movie,8,31 July 2020,"I gave up Catholicism for Lent right about the time this movie takes place, so it was easy to relate to the struggles of Alice on a personal level. Pretty sure anyone raised on a steady diet of guilt and fear of burning in hell for any reason will relate to it. For the majority of the movie, Natalia Dyer plays the complete opposite of her best known character Nancy on Stranger Things. Dyer delivers a heartfelt portrayal of a confused Catholic teen with that is largely delivered through her body language and facial expressions at a religious retreat that is not quite what it proclaims to be. I'm not sure how much those not raised Catholic will appreciate this gem; but, it's definitely an accurate portrayal of the teenage hormonal angst and confusion of being taught sex education by religious leaders who are supposed to be celibate. Give in to the temptation and watch this movie!","Yes, God, Yes"
71,cdwelcome-51-56444,Fantastic Direction in this Indie Gem,8,9 May 2020,"I had the great fortune of seeing Yes, God, Yes in the Emerging Director section of the St. Louis International Film Festival. The film is pitch perfect, and lead actress Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things) carries the film with tension and humor. I will watch this film again, and certainly recommend it as often as possible. Director Karen Maine's mastery keeps this film moving forward with precision and never misses a beat.","Yes, God, Yes"

A Catholic in my family found it amusing.

74,Rena24,Wow!! A Gem In The Wild,9,29 July 2020,"Kudos to Karen Maine!! Her writing is spot on in how she has managed to tell and share the truth (The Hypocrisy of religion) in a way that I can personally relate with. Natalia Dyer was phenomenal, her expressions, reactions, and screen presence was absolutely spot on. everyone should watch this movie. I am glad I found it.","Yes, God, Yes"
75,Tayyasqueen,Anti-climactic,5,22 October 2020,"This film held my interest, had good acting and was well made. However, it was a bit of a let down. A lot of buildup and no real follow through.

76,habakukofice,Just watch the short,5,2 August 2020,"I saw the short this was based on and it was great. This doesn't really add much of note.The plot is bulked out with high school stereotypes and a hypocritical priest, played by the horribly miscast Timothy Simons (Veep).The positives are that it has a great lead performance from Natalia Dyer, and it's a good looking and well shot movie. I'm not sure why they felt the need to set this in the past, but still in the era of the internet and the mobile telephone. That aspect is as well executed as it is pointless.The film is enjoyable, but it seems like exactly what it is, a misguided attempt to stretch a short film out to almost feature length.","Yes, God, Yes"
77,a24wang,Unexpectedly Funny,7,9 August 2020,"I liked this WAY more than i had expected. the premise sounded really intriguing, but i didn't think i would be so entertained by this. right from the first until the last minute, this movie just made me laugh and i gotta say, i had a pretty great time while watching this. not too long, light-hearted and just funny. some dialogues felt awkward, which kind of made them even better (at least after i realized that it's not the writer's fault and that i probably wouldn't be any different in real life). i bought every minute of natalia dyer's performance, but some of the supporting cast's acting felt a bit unconvincing and unnecessarily exaggerated to me.
all in all, a very entertaining movie though, and the perfect feel-good movie for a sunday night.","Yes, God, Yes"

80,modianush-77899,No Beginning & No Endgame,1,5 April 2021,"The main issue here is the Story, the story is probably written in 1 Hour, there is nothing you can take out of this film. The beginning of this film felt like 15-20 Minutes are probably censored by someone and we started it after 15 minutes and by the end nothing happens and even in the middle of the film, I was like 'okay, now what are supposed to expect here?', but there is nothing here.Probably, the runtime of this film is also a problem because there are so many things that needed to be explained to actually set this film, but nothing was there.It felt like it was a Students-Film and my actual rating would be 0/10.","Yes, God, Yes"

However, I felt the damage done by Catholic indoctrination was treated meekly at the end. The ending I would have written would have been a punch to the gut. I thought nearly all the production aspects were excellent, especially the casting. The casting for Chris, Laura, and Father Murphy was brilliant.","Yes, God, Yes"

85,abigailjackson-55395,entertaining but forgettable,6,25 October 2020,"If you've ever been to a private Christian or Catholic school, then you'll enjoy how painfully accurate many of the hell-fire and damnation speeches given by teachers in the movie are. The film has an interesting way of critiquing the hypocritical nature of the church while still remaining fairly light hearted. The last fourth of the movie kind of fell off for me as it became a little too cheesy for my taste (like the bar and speech scenes); however, I found the conclusion satisfying and effective. Overall, I thought the portrayal of Christian schools and youth retreats were pretty spot on, but the characters were pretty bland and forgettable (although I found Dyer's performance very convincing). Additionally, I expected the film to be much more comedic than it was. The beginning started off pretty strong, and then the jokes fizzled out quickly after. the film was well shot and portrayed a realistic high school very well. The film was worth the watch in the end.","Yes, God, Yes"
86,cloudbri,LOVED this movie! Any ex-catholic will,8,29 October 2020,"This movie is so spot-on about what it's like going to a Catholic School. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if I hadn't been raised Catholic and gone to a Catholic high School. The humor is subtle, but it's good. Go into this movie open-minded and I think you'll really enjoy it.","Yes, God, Yes"

But as a humanity, we should share, engage with people. It's okay to hide it, but trying to be honest is better. Alice's speech at the camp was representing this movie in short. Loved the message! Such a simple and beautiful coming-of-age story.Unfortunately, I didn't quite catch with the plot. I just feel like there is a lot of unnecessary scene here. Some of the scene make me wonder, what's the purpose of that thing. And there's no further explanation after some event. Why everyone did not asking her where did she go after she came back from the bar, how can she easily escape from the father's office without getting caught after she put Wade's waistband and caught father watching some sex scene. Sometimes it's fine to haven't to be full explained. But it's really bother me. This movie trying to be realistic and natural but for me its doesn't executed quite well.The performance was decent, Natalia Dyer did a good job as an innocent girl. I am a fan of her btw haha (main reason why I watched this, lol). Also, no complaints about visual and sound design. Everything was good.","Yes, God, Yes"

Yes, God, Yes one-ups this annoying and actually portrays (in the trailer) very unfunny parts of the movie as if it will be hilarious when you actually see it.And that is my biggest gripe here. This is very much not a comedy. There may be a funny moment or two, but I came into the film expecting something similar to Saved!
And then spent the whole film not laughing & being upset at every lost opportunity for a great funny moment. I can only guess that the writer/editor did not actually intend this to be a comedy at all.As a sort of coming-of-age drama, this may be a decent flick, but when I was expecting a comedy, I just spent the whole movie feeling very unsatisfied. Even as a drama, the pacing is very slow/off - at one point I had to check how far into it I was. 2/3 through and it still felt like just barely the introduction.Decent acting, but unless you feel this story speaks to you personally, skip it.","Yes, God, Yes"
97,cowticket-1,Afterschool Television,7,3 August 2020,"I may potentially spoil this, therefore I will tick that box regardless of where I go with this. I have a hard time rating this movie, I have read the reviews on here and I concur with much of what has already been written about it. However, I also feel that people have given this film a bad wrap for the wrong reasons. You will have uptight religious folks that won't like the sexual nature of the film, on the same token you will have people that complain because It indirectly casts Catholicism and Christianity in a negative light. No, the writing, acting, and movie itself are not the best. It's not a blockbuster film. I think people have misinterpreted what this really is. I think it's more of a TeenyBopper kind of thing. Like afternoon, afterschool TV. I think the overall message of the film is good. It takes some of the sting of religious stigma away. It's not really meant for people like me to critique the nuances. It's not a comedy, but it's funny. Keep and open mind and watch it.","Yes, God, Yes"

I heard the details of her schooling first hand from she and her friends and attended my senior prom there. She was even more ready for the real world than Alice though we were both clueless kids.I like the simple, clean uncomplicated production choices, reflective of their lives and times of the film; no excessive drama from any actor, basic realism. What an enjoyable performance by Natalia Dryer - engaging and expressive with sparse dialog. We are essentially shown what we need to know. Confusion caused by adolescence and conflicting dogma eventually gives way to a little more clarity for Alice as she moves away from superstition toward her future. To me, a positive film that reflects some key truths of modern - or any era's - passage into adulthood.","Yes, God, Yes"

One doesn't have to be a Catholic to appreciate the story though being a teen or older will certainly help. A sensitive issue was masterfully handled without being preachy or condescending.The film's length was a refreshing alternative to the plethora of movies that seem to subscribe to the theory that longer is better. This was just right, just long enough to tell the story but not too long that it became repetitive.To everyone involved with this film, thank you!","Yes, God, Yes"

And that's it. That's it.The film has a message. And it's a good one. But it throws it in your face and hopes you're comfortable with it. Things that are captured in the film do happen. That's totally true. But not like that. The script is based on throwing scene after scene at you where the church is being hypocritical and, as I say, it's a good thing. It's a good message, and it's something that happens. But you don't have to show it that way because the viewer quickly becomes disoriented and doesn't feel it's something real.All of these scenes are NOT good for anything. Just get past the window scene and NOTHING. Pass the computer scene and the bracelet, and NOTHING happens. Minutes later the great speech of our protagonist is about to come, where she will finally be able to gather courage and not shut up about what she has seen... NO. The scene is ruined by a joke and everything comes to nothing.Damn, I don't know what happens in this movie, but I feel that it has a good intention but a very bad script. If they didn't focus so much on giving everything to the viewer and trying to look superior in front of a specific type of person, it would have been something else.","Yes, God, Yes"

Knowing that people have been doing what you have been forbidden to do for years and they are alright. I like seeing movies like this where I can relate somewhat to the plot. It wasn't really amazing or the best movie I've seen but it was a good message I think. I have absolutely no idea why it was rated R since it was pretty tame for what else comes out these days but maybe I'm wrong?
