0,Leofwine_draca,Quality action thriller,8,29 June 2021,"A decent thriller from Amazon. Nothing special or stupendous but solidly watchable, and engrossing from beginning to end. Just the kind of popcorn movie that Hollywood has been so good at making over the years. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman outside of a superhero movie and he acquits himself well with his serious lead, although he was looking severely ill at this point. I was never a fan of Sienna Miller but others like JK Simmons are fine. Not a huge amount of action but one innovative chase sequence and lots of peril and suspense along the way, along with a fast pace that drops you in at the deep end and doesn't surface until the very end.",21 Bridges
1,SnoopyStyle,fine thriller,6,21 February 2020,"Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is a NYPD detective following his late hero father's footsteps. Former soldiers Michael Trujillo (Stephan James) and Ray Jackson (Taylor Kitsch) are robbing a drug stash in Brooklyn. The stash is much bigger than expected and cops show up. The duo gets into a gun battle and kills seven cops. They escape into Manhattan and the 21 bridges into the island are ordered shut. Davis is forced to partner up with Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) to track down the cop killers.The 21 bridges premise lacks the bridge shootout that it is screaming for. It's a generally good action thriller until some unreasonable moves after the hotel room. Michael has the flash drives and a safe hideout. He should be smarter than this. It's also unreasonable that Davis wouldn't get shoot at various times. Finally, it's unreasonable that he would confront the suspect at his own home. It's a cheesy crime thriller move to close out the movie. I like this up until the hotel room.",21 Bridges
2,boblipton,Shot In Philadelphia,4,22 February 2020,"Seven NYPD cops have been shot dead in Brooklyn, and the perps have fled into Manhattan. Chadwick Boseman, himself the son of an officer slain in the line of duty, orders all 21 bridges out of the city shut down.... even though there are actually 17 of them.You may not care for my picking on this point, a matter of my usual dissatisfaction with the way New York City is portrayed in films.... a movie geography that bears little relationship to reality. Sienna Miller plays a cop with an accent that no one under 70 has in reality, and the streets of Manhattan don't look like that, nor do any of the three subway stations on 23rd Street. Were the 17 bridges and four tunnels leading out of New York closed for half an hour, even in the dead of the night, traffic throughout the city would be snarled past all movement.Let it go, Bob! Enjoy this seedy neo-noir about corruption that reaches everywhere in New York for what it is! The problem is that when things like that are so obviously false, then it's impossible to accept any of it. No matter how many times every character - except Boseman - drops the f-bomb, proving their sincerity and reality.Well, at least the scenes at Grand Central were shot there.",21 Bridges
3,Prismark10,21 Bridges,5,12 February 2020,There is nothing too original about 21 Bridges. Sidney Lumet in his prime would had made this movie in his sleep and it would had been twice as good.Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is a cop who with a reputation of going after criminals hard. His own father was a cop killed in the line of duty.Two robbers Michael (Stephan James) and Ray (Taylor Kitsch) thought they were on a routine job to steal 30 kilos of cocaine and find out that they have got 300 kilos. Police come out of nowhere and they get away by shooting dead seven cops.Davis comes on the scene and orders the shutting down of 21 bridges that leads the way out of Manhattan and keep perpetrators boxed in.Davis has to work with veteran cop Captain McKenna (J K Simmons) and joined by narcotics cop Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) who are both livid that fellow cops have died. Davis is perturbed that investigating police officers have suddenly become trigger happy which points towards a conspiracy.A decent muscular action thriller. Kitsch is literally having a blast. However the twists are choreographed and I doubt many people will be sympathetic with the notion that it is alright to be a rotten cop as the pay is so lousy.With his premature death from cancer. Chadwick Boseman showed glimpses of just how good he could had been with better material.,21 Bridges
4,nogodnomasters,You're Really Good,8,16 December 2019,"Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is the son of a slain police officer driven by a code of honor and purpose. He has no trouble shooting the bad guys. A drug robbery goes bad and it involves the killing of dirty cops. Andre is told by one boss to keep this from going to trial while another boss wants them alive. It is forced to work with a narcotics agent Rankie Burns (Sienna Miller). They shut down Manhattan aka 21 bridges, in order to find the killer quickly.You knew where this was headed and you should have been able to easily figure out the dirty cops. Chadwick Boseman brought a certain stage presence to the film that was entertaining to watch. J.K. Simmons plays his police captain who has seen it, covered it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",21 Bridges
5,kosmasp,Predictable but enjoyable,7,4 April 2020,"I don't think there are many things that will be open or rather not openly foreseeable for most of the viewers. I did have one character reveal that I did not think about, but other than that ... But as it is, this movie works as a thriller, even when you know what's up.Our Black Panther is doing a great job as a stern and immovable cop, with a tough Sienna Miller to his side. Fighting to bring justice and being very aware of local geography (not sure if it is entirely plausible what happens, but it helps further the tension and keep you on the edge of your seat).Twists aside, this is fun and action packed, what more can one ask for? Yes a few things more, but this is decent",21 Bridges
6,jboothmillard,21 Bridges,5,7 December 2019,"I liked the look of this B-movie from the trailer, it had a good cast and looked action-packed, and Mark Kermode said good things on BBC News The Film Review, so I went along with it, directed by Brian Kirk (My Boy Jack, Game of Thrones, Great Expectations). Basically, one night, two small-time criminals and former war veterans Michael Trujillo (Stephan James) and Ray Jackson (Taylor Kitsch) ransack a winery and steal several kilograms of cocaine hidden in the basement. The heist goes wrong when they realise there is more cocaine than they were expecting, and the police are called and surround them. They are forced into a shootout where Ray guns down the officers. Michael chastises Ray for putting them in jeopardy. Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman, also producing), a successful law enforcer working for the NYPD, who struggles with the legacy of his deceased police officer father, is assigned to the case. Davis has earned a reputation for hunting down and killing ""cop killers,"" but he is not comfortable with this label, and claims they were all in self-defence. Narcotics detective Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) is assigned as Davis' partner. Davis and Burns come into conflict with FBI agents Butchco (Obi Abili) and Dugan (Andy Truschinski), who attempt to take over the case. With the reluctant approval of the Deputy Mayor Mott (Morocco Omari), the FBI, and precinct head, Captain McKenna (J.K. Simmons), Davis asks for Manhattan to be locked down. This includes all twenty-one bridges going in and out of the island, although they are given until only 5:00am to catch the criminals. Now on the run, Ray and Michael meet their liaison, Bush (Louis Cancelmi), to persuade their handler to give them a bigger cut in exchange for their identities changed for their escape. They are given more money and their fixer, Adi (Alexander Siddig), gives them new identities and tells them to depart for Miami the next morning. Davis and Burns manage to identify Ray, Michael, and Bush in the resulting investigation. Bush is gunned down by Butchco and Dugan when they get there first. Davis becomes suspicious as a police force led by Lieutenant Kelly (Darren Lipari) quickly managed to locate Adi's apartment. Adi is mortally wounded by the policemen but manages to give Michael two flash drives before Michael and Ray escape. Davis and Burns manage to catch up to Michael and Ray; after accidentally killing a civilian, Ray is mortally wounded by Davis. Michael then holds Burns at gunpoint and tells Davis about the drives and how suspicious everything is before escaping. Burns is angry with Davis for letting Michael escape, despite his reputation for killing those who murder cops. Michael breaks into a guest's hotel room, unlocks the contents of the drive and finds evidence that McKenna's precinct was involved in the drug trafficking and earning profits for it. After another chase where Michael abandons his money, Davis manages to corner him in a subway train and convinces him to surrender, promising to keep him alive. Michael is suddenly shot by Burns, who claims that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Michael secretly hands the drives and their passwords to Davis before dying. As the police arrive at the scene, David sees from her phone that Burns contacted Kelly before Ali's apartment was raided. The next morning, McKenna arrives at his home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint, having found out the contents in the drives. McKenna tries to reason that officers were struggling with measly pay, forcing them to go into drug trafficking, but Davis is not convinced. Butchco, Dugan, and Kelly, who were all on McKenna's payroll, appear and open fire. In the fight, Davis kills them all, including McKenna, who refused to surrender. Burns, who is also allied with McKenna, then appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint. Davis manages to convince her to surrender after revealing that he had already leaked the information online and that he doesn't want her daughter to live without her mother should she get a life sentence for killing him. In the aftermath, Davis hands in the drives, and solemnly drives off on one of New York's bridges in the sunset. Also starring Keith David as Deputy Chief Spencer, Victoria Cartagena as Yolanda and Gary Carr as Hawk. Boseman does well in the lead, Miller puts on an interesting New Yorker accent but is very good, James is well cast as one of the two criminals, and Simmons does well in his moments. It is a pretty standard thing, a robbery gone wrong with two crooks on the run and the cops chasing them, the shoot-out and chase sequences are really engaging, unfortunately the corrupt cops stuff is a little confusing and slow things down, overall though this is a reasonable crime action thriller. Worth watching!",21 Bridges

8,CinemaSerf,"A poor relation for ""Mc Q"" in the 21st Century...",6,26 April 2020,"Chadwick Boseman is an unorthodox NYPD detective who is drafted in by captain JK Simmons to lead an investigation into the murder of two police officers during a robbery. Gradually, he becomes aware that there is much more going on than a random double-murder and it's not just the criminal fraternity that he has to concern himself with... Boseman works hard, and pretty much carries this predictable action thriller by himself. Ithas enough action shoot-outs and chases - though very few plot twists - to keep it simmering along until a rather daft ending. Alexander Siddig steals his (few) scenes and keep an eye out for Taylor Kitsch, too.",21 Bridges
9,grantss,Intriguing and action-packed,7,6 September 2020,"Two men hold up and rob an illegal drug operation but in order to escape end up killing eight police officers. Leading the manhunt for the cop-killers is a detective under internal investigation for possibly being too trigger-happy. However, the more he finds out about the case, the less sense it makes.Interesting drama. Starts off as a robbery gone wrong, then develops into a manhunt, then becomes something more intriguing. The manhunt part is quite intriguing, as we see the net closing and the methods involved. It is also quite action-packed without getting too over the top.The intrigue rachets up as you go along and things are clearly not as they seem. The revelation at the end is a tad implausible though and can be seen well before the end.Overall, a good, thrilling movie. Grabs your attention from the word go and doesn't let go.",21 Bridges
10,Calicodreamin,Pretty good,7,27 November 2019,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good action thriller. While the storyline was a bit simplistic and predictable, the execution was top notch. Boseman played the part of hardened cop really well, and the supporting characters held their own. The storyline had good flow and kept up a good pace throughout. Enjoyable and worth the time to watch.",21 Bridges
11,oscaralbert,This flick proves that there are just two kinds of cops in our USA . . .,9,4 December 2019,". . . 1)Those who have proven to be Dirty, and 2)Dirty cops who are yet to be caught. The WHIPLASH guy bellyaches throughout 21 BRIDGES that cops' long hours produce a high divorce rate in their personal lives, entitling them to steal whatever their greedy grubby paws grab as a form of unearned compensation. This typical precinct captain further reasons that because SOMEONE might get rich off the killer drug scourge, it might as well be New York's ""Finest."" So he masterminds the nefarious scheme depicted in 21 BRIDGES through which the NYPD serves as the Mexican Drug Cartels' errand boys, ferrying around Kilos of Death like a satanic courier service. Anyone the least bit familiar with Current Events knows that America's present Real Life predicament is FAR WORSE than the dire situation exposed by 21 BRIDGES. This is why all defenders of Virtue, Freedom, Honesty, and Moral Behavior concur that the ENTIRE CROP of current U.S. cops MUST be disarmed, stripped of their ill-gotten assets and forfeit their citizenship before being deported to Siberia (forcibly, if necessary). We MUST do this ASAP! After all, we cannot expect the BLACK PANTHER to bail us out in Real Life!",21 Bridges
12,view_and_review,Everyone Else Was Watching Frozen 2,7,23 November 2019,"When two cop killers are on the loose with 50 kilograms of uncut cocaine, detective Andre Harris (Chadwick Boseman) makes the bold move of cutting off their exit from Manhattan by blocking its 21 bridges--hence the title. I doubt a detective would have that much authority but nevermind that.From that point on it's a race to catch these killers before 5 a.m., the time in which Manhattan will be opened back up. What Det. Harris also found out is that he was racing against more than just the clock, he was racing against others who wanted the cop killers dead to cover up a bigger crime.The movie stays fast paced for the most part. Little time is spent on exposition, back stories, or side stories. The bulk of the movie occurs within a single night so there's no time to slow things down to delve into anyone's personal life. It is a crime drama with some mystery involved.It was an entertaining movie, something cool to catch at a matinee while everyone else was crowding in to watch Frozen 2.",21 Bridges
13,phd_travel,A bit much,5,4 February 2020,"The story is actually quite straightforward if you look past the hail of gunfire. At least it's not a confusing story it's just far fetched and there is too much shooting.The cast is quite star studded with an uglied up Sienna Miller. Taylor Kitsch is the bad guy.

The cinematography was good though, as was the acting, and I guess for an action movie there was plenty of action so it wasn't that bad. But to be a real good movie, and by that I mean one I would watch again, the story can't be so predictable you can see it coming from miles away. There are also just too many plotholes to be a movie that I will remember. The good cop, bad cop has been done so many times that when I watch one of those I get bored if it's not extremely well done, and in this case it just wasn't.",21 Bridges

16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ultimately below average action thriller,4,18 June 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAndre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) lost his policeman father as a child, but went on to become a policeman himself. However, now the specter of police murder rears its ugly head again, as a number of officers are found slain in a bar, in a botched drug raid carried out by young hoods Michael (Stephan James) and Ray (Taylor Kitsch.) Captain McKenna (J.K. Simmons) demands justice, and, partners Davis with brash Agent Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller), whilst New York City is put on lockdown (and I thought it would take a pandemic!) until dawn before the stolen drugs are cut. But, as events progress, it becomes clear all is not as it seems.Fresh from becoming a bit of a modern cultural icon with his role as Black Panther, BAME star Chadwick Boseman lends his weight to this lightweight action thriller, elevated above a TV movie status with a bit of dramatic marketing, a bit more evident being the feature length big screen debut of director Brian Kirk, after a career directing shorts and TV movies. An all star cast (including a foul mouthed Simmons!) line up the proceedings, but despite the pomp of the high concept, it all amounts to a disappointing outcome.Kirk infuses everything with the requisite hard hitting, pull no punches style a police thriller such as this requires, and Boseman has effective presence in the lead role. But, when it all comes down to it, the concept is pretty ludicrous, and the outcome pretty predictable. It's good that it's fairly compact and doesn't drag on overly, but to be honest it's coming off the tracks even before this.I never knew there were 21 bridges in New York, but each of them must be more fun to visit than this. **",21 Bridges
17,MOscarbradley,One of the better action movies around...,7,3 May 2020,"The ""21 Bridges"" of the title are the twenty-one bridges that link Manhattan Island to the rest of New York in Brian Kirk's excellent, if a little over-the-top, thriller. Chadwick Boseman is the detective who takes the decision to close them in his hunt for the killers of several New York cops except this just isn't a straightforward manhunt; there is a lot of drugs involved as well as probable police corruption. It's a taut, (an economical ninety-nine minutes), exciting little picture, beautifully shot by Paul Cameron, almost entirely at night, and well cast and played. Of course, we aren't talking Michael Mann here, (though Mann could do a lot worse); this is a much smaller affair and its set pieces are a lot less expansive but it's also one of the better action pictures out there at the moment and it shows that Kirk could be a genre director well worth the watching.",21 Bridges
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Think first, shoot second.",7,25 November 2019,"Just because something is generic and, even, a little forgettable doesn't mean it isn't good. '21 Bridges (2019)' is a prime example of this. It's a really solid action-thriller, despite its tried-and-tested narrative. It does, in fact, belongs to a sub-genre that's far more prolific than you might think; it's certainly among the best. The story focuses on a tough-on-crime cop, portrayed by a slightly underused Boseman, who may not be as ruthless as everyone says. His defining principle is that he thinks first and shoots second, a quality that pretty much every other member of his police department seems to lack. It's refreshing to see this as a character strength as opposed to an internal obstacle, with the movie as a whole placing cerebral prowess over a quick trigger finger. Of course, there is plenty of action to go around and the protagonist isn't exactly sloppy when it comes to combat. The shootouts all feel decidedly crunchy here, with an emphasis on speed and brutality that's often missing from similar ilk. The sound design, especially, is fantastic, with each accurately loud pop of suppressed fire audibly blowing chunks off everything it hits. The piece has an excellent sense of tone and pacing, powering through its focal night with little time wasted and nary an immersion-breaking joke in sight. There is humour, but it's relatively underplayed and it never feels jarring. Neither do the predictable twists and turns. They aren't so much overly telegraphed as they are undeniably clichéd, but they feel at home here and typically make the story more interesting. Obviously, the plot isn't superb. Its basic nature is only elevated by a few decent, if under-explored, semi-themes and several enjoyable action set-pieces. The cast, too, are an integral part of the flick's overall success, admirably working with their archetypes to create an assortment of engaging secondary characters. James, especially, brings life to his surprisingly well-rounded role, managing to steal our attention away from the star on more than one occasion. It also helps that his character is the most intriguing of the lot, mainly down to his fairly nuanced representation and fish-out-of-water feel. The movie's music is a little heavy-handed but it works well enough, helping to establish that grounded tone I mentioned earlier. Overall, the experience is highly entertaining. It isn't exactly unique and it does fade from memory faster than many others, but it's a well-executed and compelling film nevertheless. 7/10",21 Bridges
19,ThomasDrufke,Throwback Thriller,7,3 December 2019,"21 Bridges reminds me of a lot of other action-crime-dramas but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good film on its own merits. Produced by the Russo Brothers, the Chadwick Boseman led corruption thriller centered in NYC feels like it deserves to be a summer blockbuster. It has the talent, twists, and popcorn thrills to be just that but it seems destined to be forgotten this fall. It's unfortunate because the movie is dang good and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. But perhaps it either needed to go a little smaller in scale with a tighter script or way bigger with bigger names in front of the camera and a slicker feel. But amidst all of the wonderful Oscar films coming out this time of year, I love a good throwback thriller.7.6/10",21 Bridges
20,westsideschl,Surprisingly Different,8,6 March 2020,"A surprisingly different take on N.Y. drugs, corrupt cops & a sorta outcast cop to clean it all up. Heavy on the gun action that came across as realistic & succinctly made the point. A couple of well hidden twists that caught me.",21 Bridges
21,851222,Descent flick,7,18 October 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""21 Bridges"" (2019) didn't blew my away, but it did exactly what it promised - its a slick action thriller movie where plot is a the center and nothing else.

22,The-Sarkologist,A Fun Heist Film,5,12 December 2019,"This film starts off as being one of those heist films, namely a couple of guys raid a Brooklyn wine store because apparently there happens to be a heap of cocaine hidden in the vault. Well, it turns out that the cocaine that they were supposed to get was actually ten times more than expected, and also a heap of cops rocked up pretty quickly as well. So, yeah, you can imagine that a gun fight ensures, a heap of cops die, and the crooks get away.The title comes from the idea that there are 21 bridges that lead into Manhatten, and the cop in charge of the investigation works out that these crooks most likely will have crossed over to the island to attempt to get rid of their stash. As such, he proposes to completely shut down Manhatten during the early hours of the morning in an attempt to bring these guys to justice. So, from what it seems like at first is that this film is just one of those cops and robbers films where the robbers have some pretty high powered weaponry.But, it turns out to be a little more subtle than that, and the film drops numerous hints, if you are prepared to look for them, that there is more going on that what it seems. Mind you, it sort of starts to get pretty obvious after a while that we are dealing with New York's Finest Taxi Service, but the problem is that Hollywood has never really been all that great with subtlty. Mind you, they do sort of try to keep this part of the film somewhat hidden, namely because it is the big twist, and reveal, at the end, that is supposed to shock you.However, as I mentioned, while there are some rather subtle things going on in the film that sort of sets your thoughts running that there might be more to this film than not, by the time you get to the end, and the final shootout, you sort of realise that there is more to it than meets the eye, and that final scene sort of comes as no surprise. Then again, if the situation was a bad as was suggested, it sort of makes me wander why the hero managed not to get himself arrested.In the end though, it was a fun film, but it certainly isn't one of those films that I would be making too much of an effort to go out and see. In a way it is probably more one of those films that you can end up watching on television, and it really isn't one of those lets rush out and see it either. The only reason I ended up watching it was because, well, there wasn't much else on at the cinema, and I basically had some time to kill.",21 Bridges

He is trying very hard to catch them and in order to succeed he has to make some difficult choices.I liked this movie very much because it had a nice and very interesting plot that combined very well action with suspense. The direction which was made by Brian Kirk, it was very good and he presented very well the actions that need to be taken by the police after a serious incident in order to arrest the criminals. The interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Detective Andre Davis was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Stephan James' who played as Michael, Sienna Miller's who played as Frankie Burns and J. K. Simmons who played as Captain McKenna. Finally, I have to say that ""21 Bridges"" is a nice and interesting action movie consisted of some unpredictable plot twists so, I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it.",21 Bridges

The plot follows a NYPD detective Andre (Chadwick Boseman) who got a call on a shoot out involving several dead policeman from two suspects who were caught stealing drugs. A manhunt goes out with them closing 21 bridges to Manhattan to trap the suspects and uncovering a conspiracy about the suspects.Great and intense action with the shoot out scenes. The film is filled with a conspiracy twist which may be predictable when the suspects played by Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James come across a set up with their plan on stealing cocaine. Chadwick Boseman did great in the leading role. Sienna Miller was also good playing his partner.

27,eddie_baggins,Wastes a great concept on some generic material,4,5 March 2020,"While its concept never sounded like the type of proposition that was going to provide life-changing cinema, 21 Bridges appeared on paper to be the type of 80's/90's action thriller hybrid we don't get a lot of these days, but instead acts as nothing but a rather lifeless event that fails to capitalise on its great central idea.Starring Black Panther himself Chadwick Boseman, produced by Avengers masterminds Anthony and Joe Russo under their new production banner AGBO Films and directed by well-regarded TV show director Brian Kirk, 21 Bridges has some pedigree behind its existence, making its ho-hum end product all the most disappointing.There's no doubt that the idea of a pulse-pounding 90 minute affair that see's the bridges connecting New York City's Manhattan district completely shut down to any entry or exit in the wake of a violent robbery gone wrong that has seen the death of multiple law enforcement officers is an interesting idea but Kirk can't ever maximise the idea, as instead 21 Bridges sleepwalks through its plot as Boseman's determined detective Andre Davis and his offsider Frankie Burns (a completely wasted Sienna Miller) track down Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James criminals.You can't help but feel the whole core concept of the bridges to Manhattan being shut off entirely is nothing but an afterthought, as the film instead feels entirely more generic in nature as we follow Davis from crime scene to crime scene and Kitsch and James struggling to enact out their seemingly badly planned drug heist which is a shame, as 21 Bridges could've really joined the ranks of fellow high-concept actioners like Speed and Die Hard had its cards fallen in a different way.One glaring fault that halts this dream in its tracts very early on outside the lame delivery of the films in the end very generic story, is the fact there are no characters found here that make any type of mark with Boseman's Andre just a grumbled detective 101 and everyone else just as plain and bland.It's a shame watching such talented performers as Boseman, Kitsch, Miller and even Oscar winner J.K Simmons get lumbered with such tame material to work with all unable to give 21 Bridges that kick it needed to be either an outstanding genre offering or the guilty pleasure good time it might have been.Final Say -Unable to unleash the full potential of its great idea, 21 Bridges is an entirely forgettable piece of action/thriller cinema that should've been a whole lot more fun that it ended up being.2 angry cops out of 5",21 Bridges

He produces and stars in this utterly predictable New York cop drama, where there isn't a single event or twist that will make you go ""ohhh! I didn't see that one coming!"". The minute JK Simmons arrives on the scene, you know he's just a bad cop, dirty to the core. Sienna Miller, as Andre's reluctant partner, tries the best she can with the weak material that she is given. Indeed, the poor script is what fails this movie, I mean, the movie feels complete after an hour and then drags along for another 40 minutes, strictly by the numbers In the end, what saves this movie is watching Chadwick at work and feeling his big screen magic.""21 Bridges"" arrived in theaters exactly a year ago, when nobody had ever heard of a little thing called COVID-19 and we had no idea that Boseman was battling cancer. It now feels like a different era altogether. I didn't see the film back then as it just didn't look at that good to me. But when I saw scheduled on Showtime the other day, I just had to see it. Glad I did to see a great actor one more time before it all came crashing down. RIP Chadwick Boseman, you are missed.",21 Bridges
31,subxerogravity,Tight action movie.,6,22 November 2019,"I thought it was pretty thrilling and suspenseful police drama, that went fast enough not to bore me.
I found the production to be pretty big with the whole thing about the movie being produced by the same guys who made Avengers: End game and it has a decent set of actors in it, but you're not going to get any substance from it. No depth just action. It has a message but the message does not out weight the dramatic action sequences. The Russo brothers could have done so much more with what they were given but they didn't.
And is that what Chadwick Boseman really sounds like? I herd him mimic so many famous black people that I had no idea what he actually sounds like.
Anyway. It's a good popcorn eating action movie. It's not met to win awards just make you satisfied when spending the two hours to see it.",21 Bridges
32,jtindahouse,A final film that Boseman can be proud of,8,9 September 2020,"After the recent passing of Chadwick Boseman I thought I'd best check out his final film. He'll probably be best remembered for playing 'Black Panther', but for me it was roles like this where he was at his strongest. It is quite amazing to think he was quite sick during the making of this film. If you look really hard in some scenes you can see some mild signs of it, but if you didn't know then you would never notice one bit.This is a really solid movie in almost every aspect. The plot is interesting, the dialogue is snappy and clever, the action sequences are extremely well done. In fact the first action sequence in the movie is incredible to watch. Tense, surprising and easy to follow. It's also a beautifully shot film. Despite taking place almost entirely at night, it is never too dark.The only thing holding this film back was really a knock-out blow. There are some twists near the end but unfortunately they're pretty predictable. Some actors unfortunately finish their careers with very poor films, but I think Boseman can be proud of the final product he put forward. This one is worth a watch.",21 Bridges
33,stevendbeard,Action Packed,8,23 November 2019,"I saw ""21 Bridges"", starring Chadwick Boseman-Black Panther, Gods of Egypt; Sienna Miller-American Sniper, G.I. Joe:The Rise of Cobra; J.K. Simmons-the Spider_Man movies, La La Land and Taylor Kitsch-John Carter, Snakes on a Plane.
This is a crime thriller that is produced by Anthony & Joe Russo, who had a hand in Captain America:Civil War, Avengers:Infinity War & Avengers:Endgame, so you know it's going to be good. Chadwick plays a New York detective that is dedicated to his job. Probably, because his father was a cop that was killed in the line of duty. Chadwick has a reputation of taking down bad guys-especially cop killers-but he always does it clean. He never fires first, always in self defense. Taylor plays a low level-but deadly-thief that learns of a drug house that is ripe for the taking. The problem is, it was supposed to be 30 kilos of cocaine but there was 300 kilos-someone was off in their math by a zero. Things go bad-cops show up-and Taylor & his partner end up killing 8 cops in their escape. J.K. is the police captain that wants Chadwick on the case and he tells him that he doesn't have to bring them in alive. Sienna is a DEA agent that partners up with Chadwick. The first thing Chadwick does is get the mayor to shut down all 21 Bridges to Manhattan-nobody in or out-as well as the subways, too. The police are combing the whole island but Chadwick finds that there is more going on than he was led to believe-yes, there are some twists. It is action packed with never a dull moment.
It's rated ""R"" for violence & language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",21 Bridges

Sienna Miller, Keith David and J. K. Simmons.The movie might not be the action thriller movie that could be termed as a ground breaking movie but still the movie entertains and will not disappoint you.The movie is based on manhunt of two cop killers who kills 8 police officers in a shootout and Manhattan has to locked down in order to name them, the plot might not be very exciting but with compelling action and strong acting the movie keeps you engaged.Late Boseman's portrayal of Detective Andre Davis is impressive and intense, he proves his skills with his commanding presence, Sienna Miller is equally impressive in the role of DEA agent, Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James makes a strong pair and look very captivating in their negative character. J. K. Simmons proves one of the most and surprising character.Screenplay is like any another movie with similar plot and in fact the climax also doesn't excites much as we have seen many movie of the same plot with similar execution still the movie is quite impressive due to it's some great action and great performance.

I swear like some moments I love this film and then the next it's bad and then I think it's ok? Thoughts are mixed as hell lol. The acting was amazing except from the one Narco who just seemed there for no reason. But Chadwick, Simmons and James were amazing in this film. The story was kinda bumpy. Like sometimes it's great and then it drags right before immediately picking itself back up. But overall it was okay. The cinematography and score was nothing special. Only characters I really had problems with was the Narco and the two dickhead rogue cops. They were all wastes of characters and were only there because they couldn't have Simmons throughout the whole film lol. May have to rewatch this one soon because I deadass can't have a stable opinion on this film. But as of now, rating stays as is",21 Bridges

R.I.P to this powerful performer, a great man & outstanding actor & definitely one of the greatest of his generation, I'm gutted to hear he died as i was always saying this guy is gonna be a huge star!!!!
Cinema has lost one of it's new greats but his roles & films have already cemented him as a legend with his work in the iconic & Classic BLACK PANTHER & his portrayal of that Marvel character throughout some of the other Avengers films & for me another gem in his quality filmography is the gritty & great dark urban vigilante Thriller A MESSAGE FROM THE KING, it's here i first thought this guy is gonna be huge!!!
An intense & almost sad presence on screen with a wise & weary look in his eyes, Chadwick was one of best & will be remembered as a Legend of Cinema.Here Chadwick Boseman plays a calm & cool cop on the trail of two criminals on the run throughout the city of new york & has to shut down all Bridges in order to stop them escaping from the city. Like i said there's an old skool feel to this film & a great lead performance from Boseman, he lights up the screen in his lead action hero role as a smart NYPD Detective who uncovers a conspiracy within his police department & the criminals on the run, it's an exciting Thriller with bursts of action & some great chase sequences. Boseman is great as the lead here & i so wanted him to become a sort of action Thriller hero like Denzel back in the day.
21 Bridges is also great for being set over one long night on the gritty streets of New York City. The look & Cinematography is excellent with the darkness of the city over shadowing everything & the place feels dangerous & the music is very 90's Thriller sounding which goes perfectly with it's old school approach. A cracking cop Thriller with a great lead.",21 Bridges
41,masonfisk,BOSEMAN DESERVES BETTER...!,4,25 March 2021,"One of Chadwick Boseman's last starring roles was in this cop melodrama from last year. Boseman is the undisputed killer of cop killers & wears this like a badge (sorry!) of honor as his cop father was killed when he was young. His reputation is put to the test when a pair of thieves (payed by Taylor Kitsch & Stephan James) hit a restaurant (actually a drug front) hoping to rob 30 keys of cocaine but finding 300 which becomes more complicated when a quartet of cops show up at the front door seemingly there to make a pick up. Gunfire erupts, the robbers hit the streets & all the cops are left dead (including back-up officers arriving at the scene) which Boseman & a partner he doesn't want, played by Sienna Miller (who is a cop from the same precinct as her fallen comrades), are tasked to track down but things take a turn at almost every step of the way when persons of interest are identified & quickly killed off, when the perps are at a money launderer's apartment (played by Deep Space Nine's Alexander Siddig) cops show up out of the blue (sorry again!) blasting first & asking questions later & so on. Once the smoke & gunfire clears we're left in a story which is more about the people behind the drugs then the actual robbery itself which is fine but being the kind of film which is not being made anymore (this is something your average TV procedural will dedicate a few episodes to) I get the feeling Boseman wanted to scratch a nostalgia itch which is fine but audiences have moved on to other things. The other major problem w/the film is that any person w/connected brain cells will know where the story is going almost from the get which leaves the audience way ahead of the narrative waiting at the finish line checking their watches. Boseman is fine but he's better than the material (shocked to see Matthew Michael Caranahan, Joe's brother, co-wrote this who I admire a bunch for his screenplays for Lions for Lambs & The Kingdom) & the usual assortment of dependable character actors (J.K. Simmons, Keith David & Gary Karr from The Deuce) popping up in small roles to keep the movie humming along.",21 Bridges

There is nothing with Chadwick Boseman as a Diehard kind of cop as we all like that action hero stereotype and Boseman needs a check between Black Panther films.

Its a simple crime and punishment formula. A morally upright maverick hero,who always does the right thing, even when the odds are heavily stacked against him.The acting is solid, with a really decent cast. The lead has quite an engaging presence and the action is well paced, throughout the film.Perhaps the only noticeable downside, is the morally upright thing comes across as overcooked at times. The lead is not just a moral beacon he's downright uptight at times.That being said, this is still a watchable action film that doesn't overthink things and is, in a sense, much better for it.6/10 from me.",21 Bridges

Neither have disappointed me in their Marvel outings so a cop flick should be fun right?Well, kinda. Chadwick Boseman is great, the guy has a presence on screen and I really look forward to seeing what he does in the future. In 21 Bridges he's solid, captivating at times as the righteous cop, a man guided by unselfish morality. J.K. Simmons is here too, once again flexing his greatness in a limited role. Everyone else in this is pretty one dimensional, even though a few characters aspire for more.The action is slick and fun. There are legitimate moments of tension that had me on the edge of my seat. There's even a great speech in this movie regarding the lives of police officers.Sadly, at the end of the day, this never gets to that level it's reaching for. There's too much plot convenience. Too many instances where things are telegraphed and thereby undo any sense of surprise.This movie also does something I can't say I've seen before. It feels like it took a scene from the trailer and put it in the movie instead of it being the other way around. In the trailer there's the title moment when Boseman announces that there are 21 bridges to Manhattan and that they need to shut down the island. That's fine, a lot of movies have a self-identifying line like that. This one really plays it up though with some dramatic music and build up that instantly yanked me from the movie and right back into the trailer. It was just too over the top. But, over the top is kind've the name of the game here.If you like cop movies, this might be a good fit for you. With the exception of the sound though, there's not really a huge reason to see this on the big screen.",21 Bridges

When the search intensifies, authorities decide to take extreme measures by closing all of Manhattan's 21 bridges to prevent the suspects from escaping.The best compliment I can give this film is that it reminded me of one of the Dirty Harry movies . Of course Boseman isn't Clint Eastwood but this character , Andre Davis , is very similar even it it's not obvious on face value.Set mostly at night this looks and sounds spectacular. It rarely has a dull moment and it keeps you guessing throughout.
I have to admit that half way through I was a bit confused as to who was the good guys and who was the bad guys but it cleverly puts you in the picture so you are left in no doubt.There seem to be less and less of these cop movies made nowadays which is a real shame because I really enjoyed 21 Bridges .",21 Bridges

48,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of 21 Bridges,6,23 November 2019,"""I just need the truth that's all"". So says Andre ""Dre"" Davis in 2019's 21 Bridges (my latest review). The ""truth"", is that ""Bridges"" is nastily punchy and far from being jejune. Not a second goes by when a Glock 19, a Beretta, or a rifle silencer isn't being drawn. Not a minute goes by when someone isn't being chased or shot via point-blank range.21 Bridges while energized, still feels like recycled, dirty po-po movies in the stylings of Street Kings, Pride and Glory, Sleepless, and 2001's Training Day. It's about a NYC detective who closes down the viaducts connecting Manhattan in order to seek out some nasty cop killers.Violent, loud, he-man scripted, and containing a few plot holes (and bad New Yorker accents), ""Bridges"" feels a little cop thriller, film noir in its approach. Most of New York in ""Bridges"" looks overly dark with obvious soundstages masquerading as actual locales. What does actually look like the ""Big Apple"", is a few hazy aerial shots that are numerously sprinkled throughout.Directed by a rookie in Brian Kirk (he is mostly a TV and shorts guy) and garnering a 100-minute running time, 21 Bridges comes off a little unfinished with its editing team appearing as though they're scurrying to put out a finished project. Most of the back-stories entailing the side characters (and lead) are trite. Plus, the ""Bridges"" film score by Henry Jackman is overly serious to the point of being daft.Oh well. ""Bridges"" packs a guilty wallop if you like standard police drama twists, intervals of hailed gunfire (you can literally smell the bullets), tough-talking swipe, and lots of badass stares from Mr. Black Panther himself (that would Chadwick Boseman). ""He never freezes"". My assessment: 21 Bridges ""crosses over"" to a 2 and a half star rating.",21 Bridges

[+51%],5,30 September 2020,"Knowing that Chadwick Boseman is no more, the film hits you a little differently. Nonetheless, 21 Bridges is a generic cop thriller that's easy to sit through. It plays out all its predictable tropes, including some ordinary set-pieces and a twist that doesn't send any shockwaves. Drugs, cops, cop-killers, the bustling city of NYC - this should have been a lot grittier. But the written material lacks zest. Around the 30-minute mark, Boseman's character (a cop who has earned a name for himself eliminating cop-killing criminals) talks of shutting down the city's bridges and other escape channels to trap a criminal duo who just went on a cop-killing spree. He's given a deadline to apprehend the perps.What begins as a race against time runs of out fuel real quick. In the end, the deadline doesn't matter, closing out the escape routes doesn't matter; it all feels perfunctory. To his credit, Boseman performs earnestly, given the one-dimensional writing of his character. J K Simmons and Sienna Miller are just about okay in their respective roles. The best stretches in the film include the initial shootout/escape sequence and a little chase that ensues in Manhattan's Meatpacking District.

I for one think it's a blessed relief.Andre, played by Chadwick Boseman brought a nuanced palette of intensity, dominating every scene effortlessly, and as for Sienna Miller, she is on a roll, we had American Woman and now a conniving New Yorker.

It is interesting to see how powerful the cops are, how powerful the law-breakers are and what drugs and money do to people and why. Cop-crime movies give you all that and more. We kick into medium gear and shift rather quickly into third where we are held fast for the rest of the movie. We are in on the chase and we go from one lead to another guns drawn, radios giving intel, car crashes and support from HQ. The cop on point does a decent job of delivering us his part of the movie but I must say this movie would have really gripped the road if they had a named star in this role with appropriate supporting cast. Not complaining but just an observation. One word of advice when watching this fast-paced thriller. Don't get ahead of the movie. Let the movie show the way. Strongly recommend a finger food to keep nails from being bitten at certain points of the flick. NOTE: I noticed something worth mentioning i.e. the gunfire. They use high-power guns and they pop off realistically making you cringe. Return fire is just as intense. Also enjoy the underworld of crime which is organized and full of connections that the big money buys. I am putting out a APB to watch this movie. Shots fired officer down but why?",21 Bridges

60,bankofmarquis,The direction and lead performances elevate a mediocre script,7,22 September 2020,"The world lost a tremendous talent when 44 year old Chadwick Boseman lost his battle with cancer. Whether it was as Jackie Robinson in 42, Thurgood Marshall in THURGOOD or as T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel movies, Boseman's charm and charisma lept off the screen and drew you into whatever project he is in.This charm and charisma is very much in evidence in the by-the-book cops chasing robbers action flick 21 BRIDGES. As the cop chasing ""the fugitive"", Boseman elevates the proceedings to a level above what this average script had to offer.Set in NYC, 21 BRIDGES tells the tale of Detective Andre Davis (Bozeman) who must chase down a couple of thieves - and cop killers - before they can escape New York. Told in one night, Davis makes the call to close the ""21 Bridges"" of the island of Manhattan so the bad guys are stuck on the island.And...that's the first disappointment with this film, it doesn't do anything with that premise. Do the bad guys try to escape on one of those ""21 Bridges""? Nope. The bridges are never really mentioned again...so why call this film ""21 Bridges""?What does work is Boseman's performance. His Davis is competent, honest, smart and earnest and you are drawn into his work. As is the work of the person who is thrust into the action as his partner, Vice Cop Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller). You might roll your eyes when you hear Miller's name for her early career was more about being on the tabloid pages than it was about being on the screen, but she has morphed herself - and her career - into something quite interesting through turns in films like FOXCATCHER and AMERICAN SNIPER and she is as equally interesting as Bozeman in this film. The 2 make a good pair.The rest of the supporting cast - Taylor Kitsch, Keith David and the great J.K. Simmons - are solid, if not spectacular. But there are 2 standouts. Alexander Siddig (Dr. Bashir in STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9) is interesting as the ""money launderer"" and Stephan James (IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK) is just as charming and charismatic as Bozeman as one of the the thieves on the run. If you are looking for a young, charismatic actor to fill the hole created by Bozeman's death, James could very well fit the bill.I've mentioned that the script by Adam Mervis and Matthew Michael Carnahan is nothing special, but what is special is the Direction by Brian Kirk (a TV Director of such shows as GAME OF THRONES and LUTHER). This is his Major Motion Picture debut (as far as I could tell) and there were some VERY interesting shots and some taught, tense moments. He'll be a director to watch in the future.While nothing too special, 21 BRIDGES is better than ""good enough"" - a cops 'n robbers film that will hold your interest for the relatively quick 1 hour and 39 minute running time.Letter Grade: B7 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",21 Bridges
61,agmoldham,Don't expect bridges,5,9 January 2020,"I generally avoid reviews and trailers before watching a movie for the first time. As such sitting down to 21 Bridges didn't really know what to expect. The one thing that I did expect was that the 21 Bridges were going to play a significant part in the movie. How wrong I Was!For those people who do like to know a little about a movie before watching it the 21 Bridges in the title refer to the 21 Bridges that provide access to Manhattan. As mentioned the bridges don't really feature in the movie, but by closing the bridges in the small hours of night detective Davis (Chadwick Boseman) ensures that the criminals he's hunting down can't leave.There's nothing in 21 Bridges that hasn't been done in many previous films.

64,abisio,Lots of good ideas; a good movie that should had been better,8,3 December 2019,"Two apparently inexperienced thugs (with heavy military training) try to rob a drug dealer. The were expecting 30K of cocaine and find out 300K. Something is wrong there. Police arrives unexpected and get into the building; the thugs kill seven cops in the getaway.
A NY detective with some family history and fame of being a cop killer killer is call to follow the case and pushed to carry vengeance (exterminate the killers). In order to do that, he closes the 21 bridges (and subways) that connect Manhattan to the rest of the world and the chase begin. A female narcotics detective is assigned to work with him. Nothing of course is what it seems and many things are very rotten.
21 Bridges had a lot of potential. The two veterans basically thrown away from society and one of the visible a nutcase. The very thin line between criminals and police. The corruption and the reasons for it but the movie decides to stay on the light action/suspense side and it becomes quite predictable.
Perhaps the biggest failure of the movie is the main character portrayed by Chadwick Boseman. He is not a bad actor; but his character (himself perhaps ) are too bland for police whose father was kill on duty. He is good in the action scenes (however killing 5 without been hurt was a little to much) but his character does not generates empathy. On the other hand Sienna Miller as the narcotic cop with an agenda, makes quite strong character.
The two thugs Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James owns the movie every scene they are in. Their chemistry is undeniable.
Kitsch makes quite good nutcase with violent tendencies but on the other hand James is incredible charismatic as a person who made a big mistake and cannot go back.
J.K. Simmons is just ok; but is able to steal the show in his last scene. He is convincing even when his arguments cannot hold water.
In brief; it is good way to spend one hour and forty minutes with reasonable suspense. But if you are looking for a more social cop drama go to see Black and Blue",21 Bridges

Something dirty hiding beneath.A thriller that I have heard quite a bit in 2019, but forgot to watch. The first 2/3rd of this movie was a decent thriller. The chase scenes were handled well. It's nothing new, but the good camera shots and music made the sequences entertaining to watch nonetheless.What made this part of the movie intense was Chadwick Boseman's character who always talk before shooting. That sound like a thing a police should do, but apparently not so for many cops unfortunately. Chadwick (rest in peace king) was great at showing the determination and the conscience of the character. The scenes where he talked to the criminals were intense as you hanged on into his words, hoping that he would not resolve to using guns.And this led to the main theme of the movie about following your conscience and stay true to it. Our main detective stick to his philosophy from start to finish. Chadwick Boseman's strong performance also added more to the determination.The problem was the last third act. I already saw it coming during first half the movie. Certain behaviors and facial expressions gave away the mystery that led to the third act. Also, that third act was also very rushed, but considering how predictable it was, it made sense to just get it over with.Overall, a story that is done a hundred time before, but an interesting addition of the theme and Boseman's performance made the movie mostly enjoyable. 7/10.",21 Bridges

72,MrDHWong,A predictable but entertaining way to spend one's time if you have nothing better to do,7,23 April 2020,"21 Bridges is an action thriller film directed by Brian Kirk and co-produced by The Russo Brothers. Starring Chadwick Boseman in the lead role, it is a predictable but entertaining way to spend one's time if you have nothing better to do.In New York City, Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) works as a police officer following in his father's footsteps, who was brutally killed on a case nineteen years earlier. Due to his personal determination to bring cop murderers to justice, Andre has earned a reputation for being a ""killer of cop killers"", although he is reluctant to embrace this label. Late one night, two young cocaine thieves (Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James) shoot dead seven police officers after their heist goes horribly wrong. With the criminals now on the loose in Manhattan, Andre convinces the Mayor to put the entire city into lockdown until 5:00 AM, closing off all modes of public transport and the city's twenty-one bridges until the two killers are found before they properly escape.Although it offers little to the genre that hasn't been seen before, 21 Bridges still provides enough of an enjoyable experience to viewers thanks to its skillful editing and tense atmosphere. We are constantly reminded that New York City is indeed ""the city that never sleeps"" as we see just how many locations remain open for criminals to use as their base of operations regardless of the time. This, in turn, makes for a somewhat more grounded approach to showcasing how prevalent crime can be in such a large and well-known city as we see Andre weaving his way through these various places in pursuit of the two criminals. Additionally, the film also touches upon themes of corruption in the police force and how being labelled a killer can be twisted into both a positive and negative context. Sure, Andre may be bringing murdered cops to justice, but he has still taken lives in the process, and no matter what way you look at it he has still killed someone, a fact he is shown to be well aware of.In terms of direction, Brian Kirk makes good use of the landscape of the concrete jungle that is Manhattan to emphasise how big a city it is and that it is no easy task finding two men in amongst all the chaos. He also keeps things moving along at a brisk pace with some creative editing, cutting between the criminals and Andre's pursuit of them, all while maintaining a solid balance between the two character plotlines. I do feel that there wasn't really enough focus shown on the lockdown of the entire city. Instead of obviously grinding everything to a halt, it only really comes across as a minor inconvenience to the New York City citizens and commuters. I understand that this takes place late at night, but as previously mentioned, we are meant to be shown that this is a city that never sleeps and so depicting the vulnerable points of this no matter what time it is would have been a great opportunity. This whole thing is especially annoying as I believe it robs the film of some much needed tension during the climax of the second act, and it does feel like a number of the surprises revealed near the end were unearned.This film was clearly a one man show, with Chadwick Boseman successfully holding the viewer's attention throughout the story with his general likeability and admirable moral standards. I can't help but imagine that if this film had come out twenty years earlier, Denzel Washington could have played this character, as this seems like the type of role he could have portrayed just as well. Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James, who played the two cop killers, are also given a surprising amount of development in the story. We are treated to seeing things from their perspective and not merely to view them as one-dimensional criminals ready to be gunned down by the hero. Unfortunately the rest of the cast, which includes the likes of J.K. Simmons, Sienna Miller, and Keith David, weren't implemented into the story as well as they should have been. It just felt though they were written into the film as after-thoughts, with hardly anything for them to do other than spout exposition or provide some leverage to move the story along.Overall, even though it likely won't stay with you for very long, the film may be just the right amount of laidback popcorn entertainment for the casual viewer with some time to kill. Most of its faults are forgivable simply for the enjoyment it offers without coming across as insulting to the audience's intelligence, unlike most modern films of this type. There's not much more to say but sit back and take it for the fairly generic cop thriller that it is.I rate it 7/10",21 Bridges
73,eva3si0n,Very simple and trivial thriller,5,18 June 2020,"Very simple and trivial thriller. The plot is somehow broken, there is no suspense like this, although in the plot the whole action is compressed into the framework of one night.

76,saadanathan,Another chilling movie that shows what kind of actor we lost 7/10,7,18 January 2021,"21 Bridges is a terrific film by Brian Kirk. both action packed but at the same time chilling and focuses on certain dilemmas. Adam Mervis and Matthew Michael are in charge of the script that suits well into today's manners and is correspondent to reality: corrupt officers, zero support of the public to the police due to multiple conflicts and the classic showdown of one protagonist against an army of antagonists. when I look back at the final scene between Captain Mckenna (J.K. Simmons) and Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman). I can pretty much understand why would he and his men go corrupt and sell drugs. In reality there is not much of support to the police and as a society maybe this film can teach us a few things about acceptance and humanity. Chadwick Boseman to me was the main reason to watch this film. due to the unfortunate passing of the actor and the remark he has left on this earth. I felt I wanted to watch one of his movies (even if it's not his best) and just be amazed by his acting and devotion to the role. his monologues between the beginning and end of the film are great and it just shows you what kind of a great actor we recently lost.

84,PyroSikTh,Clearly Butchered in Editing,5,7 May 2020,"I can't say I was particularly excited about this movie. Sure the Russo's were attached as producers, and I was intrigued to see Chadwick Boseman outside of his Marvel role, but even from the trailers (that played before almost every movie I saw in the cinema for nearly 6 months) I could tell this was just going to be some average, forgettable cop movie. And that's pretty much what I got, so I can't say it was a disappointment.Chadwick Boseman plays Andre, a detective facing an Internal Affairs investigation after an unusually large amount of shootings during his career. We're led to believe this has something to do with his father, also a cop, who was beaten to death in the line of duty. That night two gunmen hit a cocaine jackpot intended for corrupt cops, and are startled by said cops coming by to collect, resulting in seven dead cops. If there's one thing cops hate most, it's cop-killers, and Andre's reputation puts him in the lead of the investigation, with his superiors hoping he'll go trigger happy. And yet despite the initial impression we're given of him, he shows every ounce of restraint in the film's tight ninety minutes. In order to keep everything contained, he orders the complete lockdown of Manhattan island, closing all 21 bridges. That is where the relevance of the film's title begins and ends. What follows is a cat-and-mouse chase where the guy under investigation shows more restraint and level-headedness than literally every other cop in the entire city.Sienna Miller plays Frankie, a narco made Andre's partner due to the cocaine connection, but it quickly becomes apparent that she's in on the corrupt scheme the gunmen uncovered. And yet the film hangs on that confirmation for a nice twist near the end that falls completely flat, because no-one watching this is that stupid. Same goes for J.K. Simmons' police captain, who is so obviously corrupt from the off that it was painful to watch it dangled in front of us. Keith David plays a senior cop close to Andre, but barely has any lines and disappears after the first act, completely wasting what could've been some delectable emotional stakes; imagine if he was corrupt, making the final stand-off so much more emotionally and morally conflicting for Andre. The corruption is only uncovered by the gunmen halfway through the movie by dumb luck, and we stick with them as if we're meant to empathise with them, because killing corrupt cops somehow absolves them.In fact, I'm really not sure what message this movie was going for. On the surface it's just a mindless action movie, but the film puts itself in a difficult position of inadvertently making a position. Police brutality is a real thing in America, and it still shocks the rest of the world that it goes so unchecked over there. But 21 Bridges treats this brutality so casually that it almost condones it. Every cop apart from Andre is painted as shoot first, and often fatally, including the cops that aren't even corrupt. Every single cop in this movie seems to have such a hard-on for killing the suspects on sight regardless of whether they did it or not that it's disturbing. The notion of 'just cause' is bandied around quite a bit, with many of the characters reasoning that seven of their own dead is just cause enough. I'm sure this wasn't the filmmakers intention - glorifying police brutality - but there's no satire or critique of that line of thinking, and when you apply it to everyone regardless of whether they're ultimately the villains or just run-of-the-mill cops, it muddies the intentions a lot. All that said though, an armed black man accused of killing cops manages to run down the middle of a New York street chased and shot at by multitudes of cops, including one with a machine gun in a helicopter, and he manages to survive without a scratch, so maybe I'm reading way too much into this.The plot of 21 Bridges doesn't even hold up either. The pacing is tight and continuously moving, but it often moves so fast that important details are missed out entirely, or at best glossed over. This is not a movie about the investigation at all, as they manage to connect dots that were otherwise disconnected. They manage to find the gunmen's buyer by magic (oh this guy we didn't even know was involved is at a nearby club, let's go and confront him), and they barge into the apartment of a woman who's ex-boyfriend owned the car they're tracking, but didn't demonstrate this connection until after they'd terrorised her and her current lover. In fact we don't even know who the ex-boyfriend is until Andre is interviewing her. In a cop movie, these connections need to be made to the audience before the action, not after, otherwise it's just confusing to follow. Then there's the final showdown, where five or six corrupt cops just appear out of nowhere without any reason to be in the immediate area at all. It becomes blatantly obvious that there was much more to this movie than made the final cut, indicating that it got absolutely butchered in editing.I did like some aspects of this movie, so it's not a complete loss. The dialogue is a little cheesy, but it's so slick and full of quotable one-liners that it could've been ripped out of the 80s. Andre comes across a little too superheroic, but when he delivers such lines as ""Better have careful diction calling me a trigger"", or ""Flood the island with blue"", or defends himself in the IA investigation by comparing his job to that of military operations, I honestly didn't care too much. It's not at all how real people talk, but it had that cheesy stylishness to it that I really didn't mind, sort of in the same way no-one criticises Tarantino's dialogue for being unrealistic.On the note of Andre, Chadwick Boseman was actually pretty good as this superheroic cop who's always in the right and knows exactly what to do. He didn't get a whole lot of emotional turmoil to dig his teeth into, but as far as leading action roles go, he held up pretty well. J.K. Simmons did was he always does best, which is be an imposing and intimidating presence on screen. You could really see him as a corrupt cop, which maybe didn't play to the movie's failed attempt at a third act reveal, but either way it's commendable casting. For me though, this movie was carried by Taylor Kitsch, who has proven his talent in many projects, but always seems to get offered the bad ones. As the most brutally efficient of the gunmen, he slinked into the villainous role perfectly, while also garnering a little audience sympathy from his protective nature. Taylor Kitsch needs to get cast in better movies.The music is another thing I liked a lot. It's quite samey, and not at all original (although I can't place why it sounds so familiar off the top of my head), but the sweeping strings over militaristic drums amped up tension and added more emotional weight than the script did. It's maybe a bit too sombre and melodramatic, but it elevated the movie beyond its otherwise generic and forgettable nature. You never expect genuinely great and original work from Henry Jackman, and yet his soundtracks are often the highlights of his movies, and this is no exception.21 Bridges wasn't a bad movie, but it missed the mark a lot. The plot careened passed way too quickly, it had questionable politics, Andre is basically a superhero, the big twist ending was so painfully obvious from the first twenty minutes, Keith David and Alexander Siddig were criminally underused, and the title of the movie was actually irrelevant to what happens in it. And yet it made for an entertaining way to pass the evening; I was never bored, Taylor Kitsch was fantastic, the music was enjoyable to listen to, the action was brutal and entertaining to watch, and the dialogue was so lovably slick. I give it a middling 5/10. It was pretty much everything I expected it to be, and nothing I hoped it could.",21 Bridges

87,ethanbresnett,A perfectly fun action thriller with some decent twists and turns.,7,8 September 2020,"21 Bridges has a pretty solid premise. Two crooks who attempt a drug robbery find themselves on the run after things go messy and several cops end up dead. Chadwick Boseman turns up, shuts down Manhattan and sets about tracking them down. Not much to disagree with here in principle, its a good set up which is well executed for the most part.Chadwick Boseman as the lead was strong, playing the hardened NYPD detective with a good balance of grit and sympathy. His character had an attempt at some back story injected in the opening scenes, but in truth this was pretty flimsy and didn't really embellish the main plot or drive any later story points. In fairness though it didn't detract from the main action of the film, which kicked off pretty quickly and was near enough relentless from this point onward. Sienna Miller was very impressive as Boseman's partner on the case, and perhaps underused a little. I think her character had a bit more going in terms of back story and complexity than Chadwick's, and maybe we could have explored that a little more. I guess that wasn't the aim of the movie so I can't really fault them for not heading down that avenue. The rest of the supporting cast were all very solid, particularly Stephan James and Taylor Kitsch, who brought a decent level of energy to the film.The action was very enjoyable. It's not a particularly action heavy film, with maybe 2 or 3 bigger set pieces, some decent chase scenes (with some creative and effective camera work) and some smaller more intimate actiony parts. This was well spread throughout the film, giving a the events of the film a real cat and mouse feel.This is one of the things I think 21 Bridges does very well, is to cultivate this atmosphere of chaos, mystery and confusion. You really do get the sense that this is a frenetic and tiring night for our protagonists as they navigate Manhattan in the early hours of the morning. The way the film is shot and put together conveys this very well, which is one of the major strengths of this picture.My only real criticism of 21 Bridges is that you can see the kicker coming a mile off, almost from the first 15 minutes. They don't do a very good job of hiding what the 'twist' is. This isn't a huge criticism though as the twist plot runs somewhat concurrently with the main one without interfering too much, so it's still an enjoyable film to watch through and to experience.Overall a solid action thriller which will certainly entertain, even it won't amaze.",21 Bridges

It's hard to find anything glaringly bad about it, as it is hard to find anything spectacularly good about it.

Actually, despite having a strong cast, the film never really goes anywhere and just provides a somewhat decent endeavor, but nothing grand nor ingeniously made to similar projects out there. I did liked Kitsch who once again proves that he's an underrated actor, while Boseman (Black Panther) comes off as annoying character who is (I don't how or why) presented as Bond, Bourne and Ethan Hunt at the same time.

Um - no? This is the FACE OFF of black cop films. Also - the acting isn't amazing. I guess this film that is produced and directed and stars Marvel folks is part of the contact payback for the actor being in the BLACK PANTHER. Yes, it moves along well but overall not that memorable. We found ourselves turning on our phones and checking email. AND my boy mumbles his lines.

In this crime drama, an NYPD detective begins a citywide manhunt for a pair of cop killers after uncovering an unexpected conspiracy.

The reason ""21 Bridges"" really works is because of Chadwick Boseman's dedicated and raw performance. JK Simmons is pretty good too, but I feel as though Hollywood is overusing his persona.

director: Brian Kirk
starring: Chadwick Boseman,Sienna Miller,jk Simmons,Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James etcoverall rating 31/10021 bridges follow the story of Andre Davis ( Chadwick boseman) as there is a drug robbery that turns violent when 8 police officers are killed. And Andre must hunt these two men down and learn the answers to all the mystery. Wow this film was absolutely terrible the whole script,plot and narrative was just wrong and it needed to have a few more drafts to make it at least passable for a movie.Lets start off with a couple of very limited positives. The action was very good,and there was a solid build up of tension throughout. The action was very sudden and fast paced so left you shocked and entertained for those small periods of time. And the film did have a solid build of tension. As you got more on edge wondering who would survive the ordeal and who wouldn't. And what helped this building of tension slightly was the creative set locations chosen for the action sequences. There places where there was a shop with loads of stacked shelves and even a slaughterhouse,these were creative as you couldn't see where the antagonists were so therefore you were on edge the whole time.However the film had very slow pacing and bad execution of its humour. Wow despite the films good action sequences it was boring and slow. It was just filled with filler conversations that didn't hold much importance to the plot at all. It was frustrating as i wanted it to start getting good and exciting but it didnt. And the films humour was terrible. They tried for some humorous moments but they were not funny at all. Therefore making the film really awkward to watch in places.Next the film was very generic and the main villain Michael ( stephan James) was wrongly used. The film had such a generic formula. It was frustrating as it had the potential to go for something different but it never did. It just followed all of the other cop thriller tropes. Therefore making it forgettable. And the fact that the film was called 21 bridges and yet they were mentioned pretty much once shows you how bad this film was. And the main antagonist was not used correctly. Stephan Jameses performance was good enough. But they teased him having second thoughts during the robbery but they went nowhere with it which was frustrating.My final two positives for the movie would be the performance of Chadwick Boseman and his character was interesting at times. Chadwick proved himself to be a great actor here and proves that he can branch outside of marvel and do different projects with the right movie which this wasn't. But his character was interesting and he had good dialogue to say. And avenging his fathers death by capturing cop killers was interesting.Next there was to many plot holes and the ending was terrible. There was to many plot points within the film that just did not make sense whatsoever. Charecters were randomly killed for no reasons and there was just so many lapses in the logic with the plot. And the ending was terrible. The ending was anticlimactic. They tried to make you sympathise with the antagonist which didn't work. And its plot twists were terrible,predictable and not fleshed out enough.And my final two negatives would be the films lack of plot and no middle act. Wow the script of the structure was beyond poor. The film just didn't have enough plot to justify its runtime,which i must add was only one hour and forty minutes. The whole film can just be explained as a drug robbery gone wrong. the main character hunts them and kills them and thats it just terrible. And the film literally did not have a middle act at all. It had a small first act. And then an extremely dragged out final act that was just to long and bland and horrible.Overall despite the performance of Chadwick. 21 bridges underperforms in every aspect a film needs. It needed a new script,better characters and a more exciting plot.",21 Bridges

This movie shouldn't have been released in cinemas, especially with a low budget and unoriginal plot; you can see why it bombed in the box office.

This it its own film, and is about the craft of making it.Even little details really help. How many times have we seen action movies with dozens of police shot and the next day is just Tuesday? Well here they make a point of it being the biggest thing for years; the Mayor if flying back home from Europe it is a big enough deal.

121,hoernkeem,"21 Bridges review (2019, Brian Kirk)",3,6 February 2021,"21 Bridges (2019, Brian Kirk) This movie is very prominently promoted as being brought to you by the Russo Brothers who directed some of the best Marvel films including the last two Avengers movies. Apparently they used some of that Hollywood capital to get this film made which seems almost nonsensical as there is nothing too special here. '21 Bridges' is a pretty standard cop action drama. Brian Kirk is a first time feature film director although, at a glance, he looks like a surprisingly successful journeyman television director. This film features two low level thugs, played by Stephan James and Taylor Kitsch, who are attempting a heist of 30 kilos of cocaine and they stumble into 300. Before they are even out the door a squad of police officers mysteriously appear and things go to hell from there. The cops wind up dead and these two are on the run. Chadwick Boseman stars as the alpha police detective for a reputation of being a killer of cop killers and he is sent after these two who have just killed a few. As he proceeds in his hunt/chase/investigation there certainly seems to be something rotten going on which if you pay attention for about five seconds is not too hard to discern and figure out. It all ends in a climactic confrontation between Boseman's character and the ""good"" thief, as he didn't really kill anyone. All that bloodshed was conveniently dealt by his harder core partner in crime. Thus we get any easy sort of protagonist to pull for yet we know he will inevitably have to pay for the bloodshed anyway as the law won't really distinguish between the two. The action scenes are tense and well shot but that is about the best thing I can say here. There is a surprising amount of top tier acting talent wasted on what amounts to a substandard, or I guess the better term would be basic, project. All of what you believe for the entire story is affirmed and it is all wrapped up in a tidy if somewhat blood spattered bow. This is entertaining enough for a low thought, just to have something on movie but is it just alright with a pretty basic story template.

124,EasternZZ,"It is just ok, and here is why",6,24 November 2019,"We have Chadwick Boseman in this movie, give him some action scenes! All he does for 70% of the movie is go to a crime scene, make some macho man talk or yell at people, and then say ""We got a new lead, everyone follow me,"" only to do the same thing again.He is a great leading action star, let the man kick some ass, not just stand around and talk while other characters do all the shooting and stuff. He does get his moment to shine, but it is not until the very end of the movie when he gets to take on 4-5 guys by himself in a house. Before that he shoots one guy, chases people on the streets and subway, and aims guns at people while giving orders.Another issue is that the movie is kinda boring and bland until the final 30 minutes when things really start to get interesting. The story is very very predictable and you can tell who is the ""real"" bad guy as soon as this person enters the screen. They made it so obvious who is bad, might as well just had this character hold a sign saying ""I am the real bad guy here.""The tension doesn't rev you up until the final 30 minutes, even though you can tell they were really aiming for a ""non-stop thrill ride with the story moving in real time."" It just didn't work as good as they wanted it to unfortunately.I really wanted to like this movie, but they did not take full advantage of Chadwick Boseman's leading man status, and the story ultimately is not about him.

126,athena24,Mediocre in everything.,5,10 February 2020,"Just your average dirty cop detective story, although it's quite even in its mediocrity. The story is quite shallow and had been done before ('Pride and Glory', 'Street Kings'). The execution is quite typical either.The characters are quite one dimensional, with cliched lines and dumb heard-it-all-before excuses to justify their actions. The action and the camera work are quite routine.The one thing that is beyond the mediocrity is the trailer. It contains all the good scenes and cuts of the movie. Moreover, such as the chase on foot, that promised to be quite awesome from the trailer, wasn't that great because it was cut the same way (with scenes jumping from one to another). This is very acceptable in trailers but doesn't work as well for a sequence.On a positive side it's still a mildly entertaining cop thriller. The decent actors compensate (to the state of mediocrity) for the wooden characters. The other stuff is quite forgettable, but on the other hand, it doesn't descend to being annoying, stupid or both.",21 Bridges

129,haydenluz,21 Bridges,5,4 July 2020,"21 Bridges, directed by Brian Kirk, produced by Logan Coles, The Russo Brothers & Chadwick Boseman, was a real by the numbers, surface level action/crime/drama. With this being Boseman's first producing role, he did a decent job, but you can tell his ideas were heavy handed, along side the Russo Brothers additions.The plus side to the story was that it was a simple, yet entertaining cop story, with an intriguing first set to get everyone hooked. On the down side, the story was really predictable, with that ""I've seen this before"" type of vibe. I appreciated the story telling format they were going for, but the two-sided story seemed to clash, more than intertwine; they seemed to have had a tough time balancing the two, trying to be too complex for what it really is.Avy Kaufman casted a talented cast, but Kirk & the producers didn't flesh out the characters all that well, just giving us the minimum, in a sense. Chadwick Boseman put on a nice performance, coming off his Black Panther role, but having no heavy african accent does personally throw me off a little. His character is pretty intelligent, that displayed a keen sense to detail, but battled a troubled past that haunts him every day in his line of work. Stephan James is the main supportive character, that also puts on a decent performance. James has this natural feel when it comes to the emotional scenes. His character is real troubled but someone you somewhat can care for. We also got a little bit of J.K Simmons in this film, and he puts on my favorite performance of the whole film! He plays his stern, yet HILARIOUS self, that is nothing short of great.The screenplay by Adam Mervis & Matthew Michael Carnahan really benefited from being rated R. With the R rating, it kept most of the dialogue entertaining, with their fair share of tongue & cheek jokes. There were a few scenes that were dialogue heavy, and it got a little dry at points.The action wasn't the main focus of the film, but it was definitely the greatest part of the film! They captured a few great over the top action sequences; I just wished they added just one more. I personally wouldn't mind sitting through an extra twenty-five minutes to get just one more action sequence. The worst part about the action, was the recycled score by Henry Jackman & Laex Belcher.Overall, I had a decent time with this film, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again, or recommend anyone to see it. The only way I want to see a sequel, is if they do a clash with Mike Lowry & Marcus Burnett from Bad Boys 😂",21 Bridges

However, i really enjoyed this film and it shows that a very talented actor is no longer with us.I was on his side all the way through against the corrupt cops, which you could smell pretty early on.I was also on the burglars side a little too. Great to see Taylor Kitsch (Tim Riggins in Friday night lights!) who played Ray.Sienna Miller's character rubbed me up the wrong way along with most of the corrupt cops.

Countless; it is a staple of way too many cop action movies.And if you don't know who the bad cops are by about halfway through the movie, shame on you. It is telegraphed, and an expected part of the the formula. Here's a hint: movies don't bring in new characters at the end. It's just not done. Who you see throughout a movie is who is involved in everything. Always.In addition to being formulaic, the script is thin, too. That is covered up by having multiple chase scenes in the movie, none of which are particularly good. But they did fill in some time so the writers didn't have to come up with any plot points.The only good thing I can say about the movie is that it moves at a fairly quick pace. So, if you must see it, get some popcorn, put your mind on hold, and just go with it. You won't hate it, but you won't remember it a day later, either.

142,GavWaskett,Sounds like a very long marathon!,6,13 September 2020,"21 Bridges, we were both very excited about this one but it really was a film of two halves, the first was a bit slow but the second half it came alive and the story took some obvious but well-written twists and turns.Chadwick Boseman is a fine action and dramatic actor, Sienna Miller makes a believable American Cop, which is a surprise to say the least and J K Simmons is just excellent in everything he does.This is the type of film Denzil Washington would have made in the 90s and Mr Boseman does as good a job as he would have.13/20, just a shame the first half couldn't have been a bit more fast-paced.",21 Bridges
143,ryanwinning1,21 Bridges proves that no role is out of Boseman's acting range,8,23 May 2020,"The movie starts out with Chadwick as a little boy with tears streaming down his face at the front row of his fathers closed-casket funeral. You quickly get the feeling that being a cop isn't just a job for him: It's his destiny. The next scene he's being grilled by his superiors for using his gun in the line of duty. He gets labelled as the trigger happy cop who shoots first and asks questions later, but despite his reputation he finds himself throughout this film trying to ask questions and get more information from the perps while all the cops around him are chomping at the bit to shoot with lethal intentions. Detective Chadwick Boseman has an internal conflict going on within of who's more crooked: The criminals on the run with 50kilos of cocaine or all his fellow police officers trying to fill these guys with hot lead without the courtesy of a fair trial??",21 Bridges

Another character that I also liked was the one from Stephan James, in my opinion, he performed it very well, only that the role within the story didn't fulfill its full potential. After all, it's another action movie on the theme of police corruption.",21 Bridges

147,WooderIce64,"Good Action, OK Movie",5,23 January 2020,"Chadwick Boseman (he of Black Panther fame) stars in this action-thriller about a cop who hunts down two killers who killed 9 New York police officers, resulting in all passageways in and out of Manhattan (including its 21 bridges) being shut down as they hunt down the killers. Boseman's character is the son of a dead cop who feels it is his duty therefore to avenge fallen officers. 21 Bridges is far from the worst movie out there, but it doesn't do anything much to stand out. The action sequences are intense and, well, thrilling, and the movie is tense with its time limit placed upon the characters. Additionally, the performances are pretty good. It's well filmed and has a good soundtrack.
The movie seems to be something entirely plausible and entirely not.Unfortunately, 9 NYPD officers dying in a drug-related shooting is something that could very well happen. Completely shutting down Manhattan, even at 1 AM, is not something that would ever happen in the real world. Anyone who has ever been to New York knows that the city not only operates 24/7 but is also completely dysfunctional in its management. It takes itself completely seriously, but there are things like that in the movie that clearly don't work when it tries to do that.It touches on some issues that could be very interesting, but the movie doesn't give them proper time to develop. The hesitance of one of the killers to not only kill these officers but also surrender to the cops is made interesting with how Boseman knows that there's more to this man than just a killer, and how he became a criminal. The entire aspect about corruption in the police system is also interesting, but in this movie, it's just thrown in on the end without any real meaning behind it. The concepts are there, it just doesn't take the time to make it something much deeper than this, which is a pity because it could have done some very interesting things with them.Overall, this one's okay. By the way, is it just me, or does no one reload in action movies like this?",21 Bridges

149,garethwooduk,A satisfying watch,7,2 December 2019,"I had a good feeling about this movie and I was right, good old cop movie like something of the 70/ 80s... Great plot, suspense, action & drama with a good cast",21 Bridges
150,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,The Same Old 21 Bridges,6,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Not a shred of original plot or story-line in sightThe Big Screen: The action sequences are quite intenseThe Final Bill: The lack of originality dampens the need to pay for the action.S2SWe are going to shut down the internet and then fill blog with blue. Wait a minute! That's not how that line went. Either way, 21 Bridges opened this past weekend and Stream to Big Screen was there for it. 21 Bridges follows Chadwick Boseman as NYPD detective, Andre Davis, while he tracks down a couple of cop killers. During his midnight Manhattan manhunt, and after completely locking down the island, he begins to realize that he is in the middle of what could be a bigger issue than expected. Check out the trailer for yourself.So, let's talk about the positive things. This movie is very intense and a has some great action scenes. Those of you who enjoy the John Wick style of shooting/killing, you will enjoy these action sequences. For those of you that love the Mission Impossible Tom Cruise endless sprint scenes, you too will enjoy portions of this movie. That's all I have.Everything else was not bad, but it was very forgettable. First, the plot of the movie is almost exactly the same as every other cop-figure-out-a-crime within a crime movie. The execution of the story IS NOT BAD. Chadwick does a relatively good job of being a realistic, straight-edge and uncompromising detective. The criminals, Stephan James as Michael and Taylor Kitsch as Ray, also do a pretty good job at being realistic and believable duo; however, the characters themselves are exactly the same tropes we get in all of these movies. There is not a moment in doubt for the viewer, which is quite amazing for an intense movie that lacks any type of suspense. This might sound harsh but this movie is beyond predictable and unoriginal, it is soul-less.Unfortunately, 21 Bridges is not worth going to the theater to view because of the predictable nature and unoriginal plot. Yet, 21 Bridges can be something to watch on an Amazon Prime/Netflix, if you're bored one day. Better yet, who doesn't like a shoot'em up cop drama that you don't have to think about on a boring afternoon. This movie gets a handful of popcorn solely for the intense shootouts.",21 Bridges
151,helenbassett,21 Bridges Film Review - Brian Kirk Directs Chadwick Boseman Deep In Rivers Of Blue Blood,10,2 December 2019,"When Brian Kirk directs the funeral of André Davis's father in 21 Bridges, you see the whole of the NYPD paying respect to their fallen comrade in a fantastic overhead scene. And André grows up unafraid to take out those who kill cops, as he follows his father into the service. He never shoots first though, as Chadwick Boseman tells the IA investigation. That's fair then. He'll only take out cop killers with reason. So give him a reason.And when small time thieves Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James take on a job to steal 30 kilos of coke on ice, the stakes are raised when there is an unexpected 300 kilos of pure, uncut drugs in the freezer. And all hell breaks loose when the local police turn up. Armed with automatic weapons the pair leave all eight of NYPD's finest dead, along with the wine shop manager. André now has a reason.J.K. Simmons, how great an actor is he?, as the precinct captain, specifically wants him on the job. The 85th have just lost eight of their colleagues. He wants him to shoot first, ask questions later. Clean kills will give closure to the families, with no criminal cases and appeals going on for years. Shoot first doesn't seem to be André's style, but he is paired with Sienna Miller from Narcotics, seems reasonable given the drugs haul, and her Frankie Burns, with a daughter at home, wants to know that André has her back. André would prefer to work alone, but he does, when she's wearing that badge. And she really wants him to shoot first.The FBI want the job but André fights for the NYPD to find the killers themselves. He figures out who they are dealing with from the bullet shells, how many shooters there are, and the fact they aren't likely to get out of Manhattan. The Sopranos isn't real! His plan? Locking Manhattan down. Shut down the bridges, close the rivers, block the tunnels, stop the trains and loop the subway. Then flood the island with blue to flush out the criminals.Meanwhile our shellshocked small-time crooks make it to their rendezvous, where they are caught on camera, and manage to get across to the drug dealers who gave them the job. Cutting a better deal with their haul, now worth unexpected millions, they are given a fixer's details; Gotham's Alexander Siddig's Adi. He gives them new identities and explains how they can clean the money through him. But more NYPD police arrive unexpectedly. They have a knack of turning up at just the right time. And our two small time crooks, now splashed across the tv news, are starting to suspect something isn't right, as they blast their way out of another gunfight. It was Taylor Kitsch's Michael who pulled his gun on the cops, and Stephan James's Ray took out the shop manager. Both veterans, and both now well and truly in the police line of fire.It's difficult to catch a good cops and robber story these days, the edges are so blurred!, but Brian Kirk keeps the action fast and tight in the amazing backdrop of the city (apparently filmed in Philly), but it's a cinematographers dream with the New York skyline, and has gunfights and chases galore. And the noose is getting ever tighter for Ray and Michael as André keeps narrowing down their neighbourhood. But he only has until 5am before Manhattan has to be reopened, and the FBI take over. The NYPD want them dead before then. Even if André wants to keep them alive to tell their side of a story that doesn't add up. Michael and Ray running into 300 kilos of coke was either a set up, or just bad luck. Neither good. But it's up to trigger happy André to figure out which, and how high, and how wide, this thing goes.Throw in a few vampires and you would really have a dusk til dawn partee. They'll love the blood! And Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, I remember you so long ago in Covenant, here with Stephan James you really picked the wrong drugs deal, and you never stood a chance. But can you really blame them?, as J.K. Simmons explains. But is his Captain McKenna feeling lucky?",21 Bridges
152,pazu7,21 Cliches,4,24 February 2020,"After an interesting opening 21 Bridges quickly descends into cliches and trite chase scenes. Only in films do the bad guys try to escape by running down the middle of the freekin street. And the climatic standoff consists of Boseman and Stephen James pointing their guns at one another while Boseman tries to get him to surrender. -sigh- I can't believe that hackneyed trope still makes it to the screen. Overall disappointing. Chadwick Boseman is a great actor but this thing was just cut&paste. Go watch ""Gang Related"" again instead.",21 Bridges
153,Exiled_Universe,Worse than expected.,7,13 February 2020,"Well when i first saw the trailer right before i saw the movie i thought it was gonna be good and it might be like black and blue which was good, plus in the trailer they played panda which was so cool and i thought it was gonna be in the movie but no, no it wasn't which is sad i thought there might be a shootout with that song playing it at least at the end credits but sadly no, instead i get a horrible soundtrack and ost, every time there is an action scene or any scene at all in fact has a horrible violin track which is horrible and does not fit the movie at all and looks bad. There really was no action and the story is very dry and has been seen many times before, it also gets very boring at some times. The action scenes are basic yet modern which is good but there are only 3 or 4 action scenes everything else is just boring in a way. The acting was alright, i really thought this would be better but it really let me down i mean its not all that bad its just i really thought it would be way better.",21 Bridges
154,FixedYourEnding,Predictable,6,9 March 2020,"21 bridges connect the island of Manhattan with the rest of NY. On one action-filled night, law enforcement will close all of them off in an attempt to capture two perpetrators that had shot 8 cops in a robbery that went wrong. But it's more complicated than that since all of these cops were actually a part of a corrupt cops ring that will move drugs across Manhattan so that they can pay off their houses and wives. I liked the start of the movie, as they begin to build up the character of Andre as a small child, losing his father to some criminals and growing to be a quick-to-judgement cop. I was about to get ready for a great popcorn ride, but unfortunately this theme does not carry forward in the movie including the adult form of Andre.What could have been a great action flick is actually not more than a re-digested spat-out mediocre mix of other hundred movies done before this one. Not adding to that is a flat life-less performance by Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther, Avengers) what may work in a kids action flick may not work in a serious cops crimes movie. His roles as a police detective is disappointing and he falls short in capturing the screen with this performance. Other actors, including the support role of Sienna Miller (American Woman) have mediocre performances at best. Notable exception is J.K. Simmons (Spider Man's Daily Bugle boss) which performs well as the corrupt police captain, a small saving grace, but not enough.Big surprise at the end= the good guy wins. OK. But what about those thumb-drives that at least 2 people gave their life for? They never explained if they were used and if so what for? Could the director solved it in a better way, either show how the password 'Coldhands' was used, or alternatively have our hero record the captain's confession when it happens. He is a detective but yet didn't think of that?? This lack of script coherency just add to the mediocrity of this movie. A very generous 3 stars here from me.

164,Diablo1616,An Engaging Action Thriller,6,6 June 2020,"Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) is the NYPD detective tasked with the case of two criminals who kill several police officers during a drug heist. The deaths enrage an entire precinct, and the captain (J.K. Simmons) now has a bunch of trigger-happy cops thirsting for revenge. He decides to pair Andre with a DEA agent (Sienna Miller). But the incident also uncovers a conspiracy, and Andre doesn't know whom to trust. He has just one night to solve the case and catch the killers before they escape the city of Manhattan.Chadwick Boseman's rendition of Andre Davis is intense, and the actor has a commanding on-screen presence as well. He continues to display a lot of range in his acting repertoire to prove, yet again, why he deserves to be a leading man. J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as Captain McKenna, who makes you really care about why the police deaths matter so much to him and the rest of the cops. Sienna Miller is also impressive in a restrained performance as the DEA agent Frankie Burns. On the other side of the law, Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James make a strong pair. Kitsch plays Raymond Jackson, a sharpshooter who knows how to dispatch whoever is in his sights, and James plays Michael Trujillo, the brains of the operation, who needs to figure how to escape without getting arrested.Although the plot is neither new nor inventive in any way, it has an interesting setup with perspectives from both sides of the law. Director Brian Kirk shoots the film, particularly the action, well enough to keep the pace engaging throughout. The screenplay has the potential to explore different motivations, but the film barely scratches the surface of its subject matter. If you're familiar with the crime thriller genre, the chances are you'll predict the outcome because we've seen this story play out many times before. Despite that, you'll still enjoy '21 Bridges', because the action combined with its competent cast and their performances make it highly watchable.",21 Bridges

It's all a bit perfunctory.Nevertheless, like films like the The Negotiator or 16 Blocks, it's one of those films where you don't mind switching off your brain.It's no French connection or Serpico.Overall, in time, history will completely forget this effort.Just a footnote in the list of ""people are after you"" films.It's a Sunday morning, sofa breakfast type of film.",21 Bridges

174,Chance_Boudreaux19,Would've been a better movie in the 90s,6,4 December 2019,"21 Bridges is a decent film that's perfectly average. It's main strength lies in its fast pace and a runtime that doesn't overstay its welcome. The acting is servicable, as is the action. The plot is quite shlocky but the movie doesn't fully commit to its ridiculousness. And that's why I think this movie would've been much better if it was released in 1991. The same premise starring Wesley Snipes spouting some one-liners Passenger 57 style would've been awesome. Simple action movies like this were made much better back then as they were amped up to 11 and had very charismatic leads and villains. That's not to say Chadwick Boseman is bad in this but it looks like he thought he was starring in a much more serious film. It's hard to imitate the style of action movies of yesteryear but the simple solution is to let directors and actors have more fun, make it more like Fast & Furious. Not everything needs to be overly serious and 21 Bridges could've definietly benefitted from being more shlocky.",21 Bridges

176,keyope,"Good plot, poor execution",5,10 August 2021,"The plot of 21 Bridges, while not exactly original is quite decent, but the execution of this movie is terrible. The script is riddled with cliches and bad B Movie dialogue. At one point after some naff dialogue, Boseman answers his phone with the line ""Talk to me"". No one outside of movies ever answers a phone this way. That's not even the biggest crime, all the cops spew out weird phrases that you only ever hear in movies. Someone at one point even reels off the classic Shooter McGavin ""I eat pieces of sheet like you for breakfast"". And it's not just the dialogue that's bad. Every character is one dimensional. The cops are either ""playing by their own rules"" or completely by the book. There's nothing in between.This film has a good cast but their performances are unusually bad. Sienna Miller is usually very good, but she's so bad in this it's really distracting. I can only assume the director has a hand in this because I've never seen Miller be bad in anything before.The film speeds along at a fast pace, coming in at 99 minutes, but I got the feeling that 20 minutes had been cut out in the editing room, possibly due to bad test screenings, because there are numerous occasions where the cops just keep turning up at the right place at the right time, without any clues leading them there.There was real potential at the point when Boseman calls for the 21 bridges out of the city to be closed down, but we never even see a 20 second montage of the bridges and tunnels being closed, we're just left to assume it happened.The production values are decent and it looks like there was a sizeable budget, but Hollywood just doesn't seem to know how to do these crime movies any more. In the hands of Tony Scott and Denzel Washington this would have been a great movie. Instead it's very average and very predictable.",21 Bridges

They're trying to make it where one guy is not really a killer so basically the other thief is the one that kills everyone doesn't get injured pretty much it's not even a gunfight it's just him shooting everyone. the other unrealistic part you're making the cops seem like bumbling police officers who don't even know what they're doing. that's like a pet peeve of mine with movies is make the story realistic and then make it look real don't make it look like a video game on a movie because that's what it seemed like a one player shooter. So I got so aggravated at the opening scene that I just shut the movie off cuz I couldn't I couldn't deal oh and by the way his uzi machine gun I guess can hold a thousand rounds without having to reload lol,21 Bridges

I liked the slightly claustrophobic nature with it being shot in the dark, give it a bit more of a realistic real time feel. Decent performances from all concerned and worth a watch if you've nothing better to do.",21 Bridges

184,its-me6611,Romans 13:4,9,7 February 2020,"9/10On a robbery gone south, two men kills 7 cops. The case is assigned to Andre who has a bad reputation for shooting and killing criminals. The police locks down the island (21 bridges) and Andre is given till dawn to catch these cop killers.The film starts in the past where we see young Andre attending his father's funeral. He was a cop and died on duty. Film jumps to present and shows that Andre has grownup to be a detective. He is being interviewed by Internal affairs for killing another perp while chasing them. The same night two men break into a restaurants to rob 30 kilo of cocaine. To their surprise they find 300 kilo uncut pure cocaine. Before they could rob the place cops come by and they end up killing 7 cops in the violent confrontation. Andre is assigned a partner and they are tasked to catch these two cop killers before they get out of Manhattan.This is a very well made film. I liked the story. The film has a medieval feeling to it. It feels like we are watching a knight perusing some criminals. The cinematography is well done. There are some really cool shots. The action is intense and well done. There are lots of body count. The action reminds of Patriots Day (2016).I liked the background music. It fits the film perfectly. Chadwick Boseman , J.K. Simmons ,Stephan James are the only three person who brings there a game in the acting. rest of the casts are plain bad. Good thing is that the bad ones don't get much screen time. The film starts great, first 15 min or so is amazing and after that the quality of the film drops significantly but around 40th min the story picks up and from there the film is worth watching.This is a really well made film. I liked it very much. The film is good enough to get through the 20min of boring part in the beginning. The action is great so is the story. Really good small budget action film.",21 Bridges
185,michaeldoud,"First Hit: A solid, yet predictable, thriller about corrupt cops.",7,24 November 2019,"First Hit: A solid, yet predictable, thriller about corrupt cops.The set up for Detective Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) was robust. Showing him as a young boy mourning his father's death. His father was a cop and served with honor and was killed in the line of duty. There is also an early scene when Davis is being questioned by Internal Affairs because Davis has created a reputation for hunting down and killing cop killers.With this setup, we follow two criminals Ray Jackson and Michael Trujillo (Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James respectively), breaking into an up-scale wine bar to steal thirty kilos of heroin. Finding three hundred kilos instead, they realize this could be trouble or a setup. Just as they begin to leave with fifty of the three hundred kilos, four cops appear at the front door and knock.Not getting an answer, they break in the front and back because they find Ray and Michael's getaway car running in the back alley. Michael and Ray are armed with automatic guns and start killing cops and the lone wine bar employee.More cops come, and Michael and Ray kill them all. Michael is a sharpshooter and is ruthless in his picking off the police. The 85th Precinct Captain McKenna (J.K. Simmons), whose precinct where this crime is taking place, wants Davis on the case along with Drug Investigator Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller). Together, these two believe they've only got hours to find these cop killers or they will disappear into the civilian mass.When the detectives find all the heroin still left in the freezer, Davis and Burns question why the cops were there and why their bosses' story was that they came to break up a burglary. The crime scene doesn't add up to a robbery of this type.The FBI arrives and wants to take over the case, but Deputy Chief Spencer (Keith David) and Captain McKenna argue to let the NYPD handle it for the next few hours. If they don't solve it in a few hours, the FBI will take over.Setting up this urgency allows Davis the ability ask that all 21 Bridges to Manhattan Island be shut down, as well as all subway lines and trains. After doing this they start to ""flood the island with blue"" (cops).At this point, the movie follows both Ray and Michael trying to evade the chasing cops, Burns and Davis. This cat and mouse game are well presented as the plot adds in new characters, the owner of the three hundred kilos, a money launderer, and the suspicion that something else is up.Boseman is excellent as a detective that is focused on justice and the law. The final scenes with McKenna and Burns present a predictable conclusion. Miller is outstanding as the Drug Investigator who is really doing a balancing act. Simmons is sublime as a guy who believes he's helping the department's force with his actions. Kitsch is outstanding as the highly charged marksman of the criminal duo. James is a revelation in this role. He brings a perfect blend of viciousness and emotional heart to his character. His final few scenes clearly give the audience a man who is trying to find a way while honoring his brother's impact on his life. Adam Mervis and Matthew Michael Carnahan wrote an excellent screenplay that encompassed well-choreographed action and intellectual endeavors. Brian Kirk did a fantastic job of bringing this story together and making it all feel believable.Overall: This was a solid film, even though it was highly predictable.",21 Bridges
186,northernpaladin,Time well spent,7,18 December 2020,"At last, a police procedural thriller that works. No mach posturing from big name stars, no aging has beens from the 80's who should be enjoying retirement, no endless and increasingly ridiculous plot twists, no rising from the dead last shot and no wise cracking.
Here we have a well scripted, well directed, well acted intense thriller using the well worn plot device of tough honest detective on a simple manhunt that reveals police corruption but manages to look fresh and original.
Boseman carries the lead effortlessly, I believed he was the detective and not some guy from a Marvel film doing something 'worthy', Miller and Simmons occupy fleshed out co starring roles and the supporting players, especially the two criminals, are well developed.
The mood is dark and dangerous and the director immerses us in a Manhattan locked down in the early hours in a way that makes you feel you are there with Boseman, all helped by a cracking g score.
The film doesn't shy away from the violence associated with the genre but none of it is gratuitous and all the gun battles, big and small, feel real and frightening.
For some a problem might be the familiar idea which is at the core of the film and the audience realises where the film is heading at the same time the detective realises something is not quite right, but I would contend this doesn't matter because the getting there is done well and is believable in its own context despite the familiarity of the plotting device.
Thoroughly recommended.",21 Bridges

In this age of 30 year old teenagers obsessed with comic movies, it is great to see a genuine crime movie wth real characters on both sides and a tight plot that was well filmed with no need to provide explosions or titties for the teens. Both the 'bad guys' are excellent - especially Taylor Kitsch who has been miscasted foir a while now - he is a 'complicated' character and needs that sort of role to shine. Chadwick will probably end up as a TV cop and that will be great if the series has good director/s and writers - but I sure hope he makes a few more cop movies.",21 Bridges

I was excited for this film. The trailers looked intriguing and I'm a huge fan of Chadwick Boseman and with the Russo's producing I though we could be onto something. Sadly I left this film feeling entertained but extremely overwhelmed.21 Bridges has a good concept: a city wide manhunt, conspiracy, racial tensions as well and I had a good cast to boot. Chadwick Boseman does a really good job in this film and carries it on its shoulders. It's also made up of some fun action scenes some shootouts, but it's all the standard stuff we've seen before.21 Bridges problem is the half baked script with familiar ideas that aren't given to us in a fresh new way but more of a recycled way. It feels lazy as well as weak. This makes a lot of the film just a by the numbers cop drama. That doesn't mean it's bad. It's an enjoyable movie, but it's not going to stick with me much after finishing it.21 Bridges has a good cast good acting, it's slick, it's fast paced, action packed but it's story remains flimsy filled with ideas we've seen before with nothing new added.",21 Bridges

No surprises at all. It starts from the killing of a character named Toriano at a nightclub (no surprises), then Frankie the Narc aiming for straight kills rather than investigating to find out who the big fish is behind the whole 300 keys drug scene.You may want to skip this one and watch reruns of some 80s flick with more merit.",21 Bridges

it's one of my favourite movies, but I decided to review it today.21 Bridges is a fast-paced action crime thriller with brilliant performances and brilliant camerawork, very good action scenes, a decent story line with an interesting plot-twist.We find out there is more to the story than two thieves, that there's an entire police precinct that are dirty cops.The excuse that the dirty cop gives at the end is pathetic...overall in these movies with dirty cops, they see criminals making more money than them - they get jealous and decide to be criminals themselves instead of doing what they originally signed up to do.The dirty cop mentions that ""it isn't about materialistic things"", ""that it's about being with their families and being able to pay rent and mortgages"", and that ""They're protecting people that hate them""...well quit your jobs or go on strike for equal pay.What the dirty cop leaves out is greed comes into play.Chadwick Boseman's character got into trouble in the past, and these dirty cops thought he would just start shooting the guys that their looking for with no questions asked, but what they failed to know is that he actually abides by the law and is a true cop who wants answers.The two thieves/cop killers made a big mistake when one of them did not stop for the light in the car, that is how police found out who they were - through that car and it's owner.Rewatchable.",21 Bridges

It doesn't try to do anything too complex but what it does, it does very well.The visual is impressive - with a dark, slick look that reminded me of The Dark Knight and The Crow - the grubby, wet city lit up with neon lights and gunshots.The acting is great, and the action comes thick and fast. The plot is pretty much solid. In short, there isn't much to not like.If I had any complaints, it's that the chase scene through the abandoned building gets a bit ridiculous and is the only part of the film that feels particularly unrealistic.I enjoyed the nods to other films, with the opening line mentioning ""Avenger"", Gambit's coin flick, and the ""Collateral"" subway scene.On the whole, this is well worth a watch if you like fast-paced cop dramas.",21 Bridges

259,stephenmatlock,"Satisfying, well-crafted cops-and-robbers with great actors",8,8 December 2019,"I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. I generally do not like films where people die on screen. I'm not someone who can watch violence easily. But while there was violence, and people die violent deaths, at least the deaths are quick and do not emphasize gore. (Definitely deserves the R rating for onscreen violence and death.)One of the things that made this film good is the many twists along the way. I won't spoil it for you, but there are some surprises. And the actual filming has many clues scattered along the way that, if you're paying attention, bring a satisfying close.Chadwick Boseman is, of course, excellent. The man can inhabit a thousand tongues of dialect. And he is an action hero in this film with its *many* on-foot chase scenes through Manhattan--not just on the streets, either.Stephan James (""If Beale Street Could Talk"") plays one of the two ""bad guys"" who perhaps has stumbled upon something bigger than he realizes, and who sees the ground constantly dissolving under his feet as he is betrayed again and again. He is wonderfully active and athletic--as he needs to be, as he becomes the Most Wanted Man in Manhattan.Sienna Miller plays Boseman's sidekick who is fierce and dedicated, and maybe has a few secrets.J.K. Simmons is, of course, J.K. Simmons, and does not disappoint. I thought he was better in ""Whiplash,"" but he's still J.K. Simmons everywhere he appears on screen.I was disappointed in the casting of Keith David in a throw-away role, and I wish the casting agents had found a better vehicle for him. He is adequate in the small part he plays, but he could do much better than this.I'm not familiar with Taylor Kitsch, who plays Stephan James' partner in crime, but he does well as the violent criminal with few regrets about his actions.I was surprised to see Alexander Siddig in the credits, as I didn't instantly recognize him in his role as the ""laundromat."" He had a good arc, and in the later scenes there are broadly placed clues that remind us that what we see is not always what we think we should see.There were a few loose ends, but it might have been my inattention in this 100 minutes of this movie. It moves quite fast, but there aren't wild leaps of logic--just incredible revelations of systemic corruption.As far as the underlying world of this film vis-a-vis the police--Boseman is a police detective, and does an admirable job of moral certitude in a world of grays and fog. But there are also other police officers who are more comfortable with the ambiguity of doing what seems right by doing what is actually wrong. There's no paean to cops, and there isn't an incessant critique either. The humans of New York have humans as their imperfect defenders and martyrs.I gave it a ""8"" for the satisfying craft that went into the development of this film. It's a solid cops-and-robbers film with surprising twists and satisfying conclusions.",21 Bridges

It appears to be no coincidence he is called in to catch and dispatch a pair of cop killers who just slayed 6 of New York's finest in a bungled heist.Knowing the criminal mind he knows they'll run so the only answer at 2am is to close Manhattan Island in hope of trapping the ruthless fleeing heavy hitters.It appears he's the only one wanting answers as the rest of the NYPD start taking aim at anyone even partially involved with extreme prejudice.Bouts of realistic violence in a relentless chase through a grimy city at night with crisp direction and editing that tells this dark tale with more Hollywood and less serpico but still broody and punchy. Clear angles and shots that allow you to focus on the characters and the action without getting overwhelmed by the pacing.Chadwick Boseman (everybody's favourite warrior king) kills it as the highly motivated and street smart detective renowned for despatching dangerous criminals like a modern gunslinger when few others would have the moxy.A good enough supporting cast to carry the story through to the final bullet.Probably predictable to some but definitely worth the investment of your time and money.,21 Bridges

The movie is by no means a bad one but with Chadwick Boseman in the lead and produced by the Russo Brothers, I'd be honest I was expecting more. The performances are convincing and the action sequences are helpful. The story line gets more interesting as it advances, creating enough mystery to keep you watching till the end.

265,zhenwenho,Nothing Fresh,5,7 January 2020,"This is a movie where the company has no faith in the director which is indeed a warning sign as we can see what happened to Moral Engines. This is a movie produced by the Russo brothers, not directed, not written by them. You could simply skip this movie if you were really looking forward to this one in the New Year but you could certainly enjoy this movie too if you're trying to fill your time.The prosChadwick Boseman manages to do his best with what was written which isn't much to be honest but he does well commanding the screen and in a sense driving the audience's interest in his character which is a two dimensional character.Another thing would be the soundtrack, Henry Jackman's unique style of music when it comes to thrillers which presents us a some sort of Captain America: The Winter Soldier-isc soundtrack which to some degree drives the action in this movie in certain moments.The consThis movie suffers from a poor script which ends up bogging down this movie which in turn means, this is a movie where you've seen this plot recycled multiple times over the previous decade and it brings nothing new to the table. Hence, making this movie a highly predictable movie.Unlike a recent movie, Knives Out, which has a fairly predictable plot too, this movie fails to excell in aspects such as its cinematography or even the action sequences. A truly disturbing sequence of shots would be within the first 10 minutes of the film where they have a minute long sequence showcasing Manhattan's bridges, a truly unecessary shot.Furthermore, there was an attempt to provide a heavier backstory for the antagonists to allow us to relate and care for them in some manner but that absolutely went down the drain due to the manner the information is thrown at the audience; in the form of exposition.",21 Bridges

Unfortunately it's missing something which is rather elusive...It lacks memorable moments/acting.You remember in the end of Street Kings when Forrest Whitaker is forced to explain his actions to Keanu Reeves, or the way Denzel delivered his lines as Alonzo with a side of goosebumps throughout Training Day. Do you remember marvelling at the brilliance of Al Pacino with his crazy off the cuff sounding remarks throughout Heat ""GIMMIE ALL YA' GOT""... This film, lacks this.Nothing ever really adds up well, you've got an intro with the main character as a child at his father's funeral which by the end fails to tie at all, except to serve as an example of the main characters moral code, we see his mom who's ill, also... Just because. You've got the brilliant Keith David... as a cameo!! The camera barely even brings him into focus, you've got a cast who all performed well but none really stood out.It just doesn't really do anything new, there's nothing special here, it's just supremely average, only reason I gave it a 6/10 is because I love these kind of movies, and it does function well from beginning to end.Sadly lacks the magic though.",21 Bridges

310,johannordin1,Does what it sets out to do,7,29 March 2020,"You know what this movie is about, the bad ass protagonist with the female side-kick kicking ass with twists along the way. Almost a carbon copy of so many other of these ""not-quite but kind of"" buddy cop films, they start out disliking each other and bla bla. Although my tone make it seem like it's not worth watching, and to some this may be true, but I know I can't get enough of these types of films, they work for a reason and this one does as well. I wish it was a little bit longer so they had time to flesh out the later parts of the film, but it's a satisfying watch with a lot of cool scenes and great acting. For a film like this a 7/10 is quite a good score to me.",21 Bridges
311,brandonjohnsonkean,Need to watch,9,3 September 2021,I watched this bc i wanted to see what Chadwick and the Russo brothers ( Russo brothers are the produces ) could do outside of marvel and my god this movie is fantastic.,21 Bridges
312,Lukewarmwinner,Not bad not great,5,20 September 2020,"This is a great flick when nothing else is tempting. It's not that bad, but not great either.
It's old school cop versus robbers and it works. But other that that, it wants to be more layered than it really is. You'll guess the plot and accomplishes pretty quick.
But see it for what it is.",21 Bridges
313,cemarzu,Good movie,8,30 November 2019,"I really don't understand the bad reviews
It was a good movie , I am sure you will enjoy it as well",21 Bridges
314,mackeanjunior,You've heard the story before ? Well it doesn't matter.,8,28 February 2020,"I find it very very disturbing to see that reviewers or random viewers just throw shade on a movie just for the fact that they've seen it before. If you haven't noticed by now, most movies created are stories that have already been told severally but the way these directors and producers and actors play it out is just amazing. That is the real satisfaction you get out of your experience with any movie. An original story is usually a bonus to the audience.So just relax and enjoy this one, if you haven't already. The Russo Brothers, and the Director really went all out on this.",21 Bridges
315,3mrdaif,Fantastic..,7,15 November 2020,"I really liked it, but I wonder how come Detective Burns showed up in the train?",21 Bridges
316,gameartde,Great movie.,8,1 December 2020,"The music was very well made. It fitted every scene.
I liked the deep character played by Chadwick, great acting, great storyline, a character whom u might not mess around with.A little plot twist, a good one, but not like a huge one. Didn't surprise me that much because they took the twist kind of away by teasing it two or three times before the actual plot emerged.Very good acting, and I really don't have a single complain about anyone in this movie. Very good casting and acting right there.It was available on Prime, nice cover, got my interest.If you like to see Chadwick Boseman as a hardcore detective and you love action, you might consider watching this movie.",21 Bridges
317,Roro65,Decent and entertaining,8,26 September 2020,"Average plot but the acting is above par so it keeps you engaged.
Saw this in the theater and had no idea Chadwick Was ill. Watching it again it is noticeable.
Watched a video of an actor who worked with him in one of his last films and he said Chadwick came to work with what seemed like an entourage, as if success had gone to his head.
Since he told no one his health issues it Turns out These people were caretakers assisting him in keeping him comfortable, medicating and monitoring him between take.
The actor didn't realize this till he passed and felt terrible. Was crying and regretting everything.With each movie Boseman did you could tell he was going to be great. His screen presence was awesome.
We lost a good one",21 Bridges
318,sm_u_know,Don't get the hate,8,22 July 2020,"This was definitely above average. Chadwick Boseman does a pretty fantastic job. Sienna Miller definitely deserves a lot of praise for her work too. The story might be something that's considered predictable, but what cop movie isn't. The execution here is what sets it apart from the movies in this genre",21 Bridges
319,rizwanalvi,What a crap movie!,1,28 November 2019,This is such a garbage piece of movie! Don't waste your time or your hard-earned dollars!? Just wait to see it on Netflix or some streaming app!I don't even know where to begin!?,21 Bridges

322,peresnathan,Pleasantly surprised,7,5 January 2020,"Much better than what I expected. I likes especially the cinematography remenicisent of 90's action classics such as """"the fugitive"".Having said that, the movie is of course not a classic itself and might be quickly forgotten but it gives you good entertainment that you want to see after a week of work. No identity politics or political statements here. Just having a good time.",21 Bridges
323,selimbudakoglu,Its ok,7,12 August 2020,"Watch it after ""tax collector"" :) Once you watch that one others will be seen better...",21 Bridges
324,k-s-e-n-i-y-a,Classic,10,22 November 2019,"If you missed classic, action packed movie, this is for you! Lots of action, everything is realistic.",21 Bridges
325,Dearden_2001,Action packed and absolutely best movie 2019,10,25 November 2019,Absolutely suspenseful and action packed the movie was absolutely amazingly well put together! I really liked how it appealed to me showing the fact that he was a clean cop surrounded by dirty cops and no matter what he stuck to what he believed in and I loved it he followed in his fathers footsteps and I really enjoyed the film. Top of the line best film I've seen this year alone!! By far the best movie I've seen underneath endgame of course but yes this movie deserves awards and 5 stars for sure! Hands down I want to give props to the main character played by Chadwick Boseman well known as black panther! His character Andre Davis was so well played and acted to portray just how all cops SHOULD do their job honorably. I was the only one in the theater to yell out profanity when his partner Frankie Burns played by Sienna Miller took the shot!! I knew she was dirty the whole time she wasn't trying to bring Micheal in who was played by James she was trying to run him over and when she took the shot I was so angry and suspicions were so brought to light!The actors and directors producers everyone who made this film possible I'm a huge fan of your work thank you for making this film it was the best movie I've seen this year alone underneath Endgame of course lol!,21 Bridges
326,electrichoundog,Not one weapon reload in the whole movie!,6,28 May 2021,"Good enough to fool people into thinking it's a good movie, but ultimately it's very cliched and lacks anything unique or substantive.",21 Bridges
327,princess_joyjoy,Boseman and James carry a lumbering cast.,5,20 December 2020,"Predictable, cliched and Miller was really really bad.
Feel sad that this was Boseman's last film, he was a cracking actor, too good for this nonsense.",21 Bridges
328,xjamesourownx,The New Training Day,8,11 December 2019,"Chadwick Boseman has so much on screen charisma in this movie he could quite soon be one of the biggest names in Hollywood, his performance was utterly compelling. When an actor doesn't even have to speak and you know what they are thinking off by their eyes then that is special. In fact the entire cast is very strong with spot on performances from all of them,This is a very strong film, if you liked Training Day here is another film with cops and bad guys (or are they one and the same?). Boseman is a detective who lives for the badge out to stop two robbers who have left a bloodbath of cops behind them.Can Boseman solve the mystery and stop the robbers or will he simply get revenge?The only loss of points for me was I guessed the 'twist' from the beginning, otherwise it could have been even more of a great must watch film",21 Bridges
329,monccaa,Predicable,4,5 May 2020,"I was hoping this was going to be a decent cop-thriller movie due to the reviews and rating... Oh, I was wrong. The amount of cheesy-heroic camera shots and lines were too much for me. It doesn't feel real. You could also pretty much predict what's going to happen, who is the bad guys and the ending. I give it 4 stars due that it wasn't unwatchable, the scenery and camerawork was quite good and the fight scenes were decent, but I wouldn't watch it again.",21 Bridges
330,thebishop1405,A Good Throwback Cop Thriller,8,22 November 2019,"I sometimes see people rate a movie highly and complain about the other low scores people have given it. Irks me particularly if the movie/series was actually poor. This film is not that!A well directed, well acted cop thriller with enough twists to keep you interested throughout the movie.Gritty, but also nuanced on who you end up rooting for in the movie. I genuinely can't understand the low ratings for this.",21 Bridges
331,sdvick,Annoyed,5,5 September 2020,I tried watching it last night on Showtime. I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes. The audio/visual was badly out of sync. Did anyone else encounter this problem?,21 Bridges
332,mjrusso-30081,Finally a good cop movie,9,9 February 2020,"This movie was actually pretty good. Chadwick played the part very well. He was a good moral character and had a just cause. A lot of cool action too. Crazy shoot outs, chases, etc. With the Russo brothers producing, I knee this would be a gem and I was right. Definitely worth checking out.",21 Bridges
333,smcfdc-34449,One of the Best Films of 2019,10,29 February 2020,"Well written and acted. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Boseman and Miller. Edge of your seat drama from start to finish. Definitely worth your time. This film is full of action. Blink and you may miss something.",21 Bridges

335,angelnyy,"Predictable, not exciting. Nothing surprised.",3,18 February 2020,"Not something I have not watched before. If you expect fighting you will be disappointed. This whole movie is only shooting. I was waiting to see the ""black panther"" at least have some fighting moment. Story is so predictable. It doesn't took me more than 30mins to figure out the female inspector with him is also a dirty cop too.",21 Bridges
336,brendan-18139,Pleasantly good,8,22 April 2020,A surprisingly decent movie. Black panther is solid and it was a good watch. Not bad at all highly recommended,21 Bridges
337,calveloalbert,meh,4,18 August 2020,"It's just another dirty cop movie but this time with black panther. being ""from the makers of captain america: civil war"" made it nothing more special other than being a click bait. spoiler alert...no post credits!",21 Bridges
338,quaereverum1,A decent cop thriller!!,7,16 February 2020,"The scenario is certainly predictable, yet the movie is still enjoyable. Those who love action movies like myself will like it a lot.",21 Bridges
339,crudolf-82160,Nothing new,6,15 November 2020,Predictable cop movie with a predictable ending. Ho hum,21 Bridges
340,counciltours,Possibly the dumbest movie of the year.,3,22 November 2019,"C.Boseman as a child has his cop father killed in action by some crackheads. He grows up to be a cop himself but with a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later leading to him being called up in front of a tribunal for his trigger happy ways . He says "" ya gotta look the devil in the eye "" and luckily that seems to satisfy the tribunal. Tough interview ! A whole bunch of cops are killed in a shootout with a couple of gangsters and our hero is set loose on them with the suggestion that he not bring them in alive to save the families of deceased cops the agony of seeing them go through the court system. Very early on it becomes clear that dirty cops are involved .I wouldn't exactly call this a spoiler as anyone with two brain cells could figure it out once the action starts ......and what a lot of action there is ! Unfortunately most of it involves armed stand-offs between two characters ..... bad guy V bad guy .... bad guy V cop .... cop V cop ....I lost count after a while . The dialogue is risible . At one point the heros' cell phone rings and he barks into it ""talk to me !"" .... has anyone in the real world ever said this unless making fun of cheesy dialogue ? Actually I left before end during yet another guns-drawn dialogue so maybe it managed to turn itself around in the last 20 minutes or so. I have my doubts.",21 Bridges
341,mizlaker,Great,8,24 November 2019,"The movie was highly enjoyable, but the story was somewhat predictable.",21 Bridges
342,sabbirsourov,good movie with very good casts,7,23 June 2020,"The story of this movie is nicely presented. The sequence of events consistent. The plot is nothing new. I could predict some of the things right after watching for 20 minutes. However, that does not make the movie any less interesting. The making of this movie is very good. The camera work is great. All the actors delivered very well. Chadwick Boseman as usual charismatic. I had watched Chadwicks another netflix movie its called ""Message from the king"", he was extremely good in that one. The plot of that movie was awesome. Its a nice family movie. The plot of this movie could have been made a bit more away from the norm. I think they just wasted a nice opportunity. It gives me a feeling that they were in a hurry to complete the project and put this on streaming as quickly as possible. However, thumbs up to the actors who really try to make an ordinary script look awesome. Recommended to everyone.",21 Bridges
343,sobei24-516-335152,Good but predictable AF,6,8 May 2021,Chadwick was solid but I figured out the plot after the first ten mins. I was hoping for intrigue and suspense and all it gave me was trope after trope. A decent movie with an underlying theme was able to keep me entertained but not to watch it again.,21 Bridges
344,sgch86,Old school cop movie with a great cast,8,27 April 2020,"Enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected. It's very well written and has a load of actors I like - Alexander Siddig and J.K. Simmons especially.Boseman gives a great central performance, and I feel like this movie would have been huge in the late 90s or early 2000s if it had been a contemporary of movies like Training Day.Great acting in a fun story that while slightly predictable I really wanted to see how it ended. Recommended.",21 Bridges

346,illu2,Entertaining enough,6,9 February 2020,"Only read this after you've seen the film.
It was entertaining enough, some nice views of Manhattan and some good set pieces.
You could see the plot and any twists a mile away and the killers sometimes did stupid things like run red lights, go into a hotel room and not close the curtains or wear a cap or disguise themselves. I think we needed to care about the characters more to give the film a bit more impact.",21 Bridges

351,spritzz,Disappointing,5,19 March 2020,"I really wanted to love this movie as I was in Philly on vacation and got to see some of the action shots filmed. I even got a little token from a scene. However, the plot lacked depth. It was a good idea that fell flat. With the exception of Stephan James, I thought the acting was just okay. There were some pretty corny lines throughout (""we're here for your cocaine."") and some parts that needed to be better developed (the money laundering guy with all the info).Overall, I wanted to enjoy it, but it was pretty okay.",21 Bridges

353,ajbran70,Great police action movie!,10,1 March 2020,"Saw the trailer and it looked good, rented it and it was great! I don't know how it did in theaters, but this was a good solid police action movie. Really good performances by Boseman & Miller with a pretty loaded cast of big names. It's definitely worth watching...full of action and doesn't bog down in places.",21 Bridges
354,obiwardkenobi,Enjoyable,7,16 April 2020,"Enjoyed the film, although I would say it was predictable from very early on. Never the less well worth a watch",21 Bridges
355,ladycatkins,An intelligent roller coaster ride,9,14 March 2020,"This was a very taut, intelligent, action thriller. The actors were perfectly cast from the leads on through. The Police were not the usual sterotypes that often populate this type of film. Even the Deputy Mayor showed more depth that than would normally be seen in a minor supporting character. The villains of the piece were not your run of the mill crims but experienced, smart and a good team. They knew exactly what a mess they had stepped into and, even with some bravado, they still knew there was very little chance of getting out of this mess. The writing was a breath of fresh air. Not only are the characters allowed to be intelligent and erudite but the audience is expected to (be intelligent) as well. Viewers paying attention at the start will have picked the underlying issues early on but there was no explanation scene. Instead there were lots of small explanations through the action. And there was plenty of action! The movie didn't really slow down all the way through. For those paying attention the climax was quite satisfying. There were ultimately no winners, no happy ending but damn, it was a satisfying roller coaster ride. Very highly recommended.",21 Bridges
356,thearcticmonkey2007,Strong film and good cast,9,15 March 2020,"Definitely worth the watch in my opinion. Obviously not an original story line, but I thought it had good actors and it was directed well.",21 Bridges
357,teaguem2005,Action,8,23 November 2019,I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Lots of action. I love seeing my city in movies even if they pretend its someplace else. There aren't any slow parts. Some outcome was predictible but it still was a good movie. I recommend it.,21 Bridges

359,lgilpin-75291,Predictable but a great ride,7,27 November 2019,The thing I like about this movie is that it doesn't try to trick you with the twist and you should easily figure out early on. However how we get there was a lot of a fun and exciting. This is the type of action movie we need more of. It doesn't try to be more then it is and is a ton of fun. All the actors do a great job and there are a ton of fun and exciting action moments and lines,21 Bridges
360,albertmartinez-33947,Made me want to see more of these type of movies,9,20 February 2021,"Fantastic movie! I loved Cop Land with Stallone and other greats. This movie made me feel the same. What a thriller. My wife is so into these movies and she had it figured out. I, on the other hand, am slow but the movie kept my attention and I loved it.Yeah, many other movies like it, but it's never bad to see a good cop work for justice.",21 Bridges
361,postmortemMMXX,terrible mesage bad acting total trash,1,9 August 2020,"Is this supposed to motivate cops to turn against each other? especially in times like this when police are hated so much? i think it has a terrible message.
as for choice of the actors: the sharp black detective and sienna miller? i think sienna miller is awful for her role being a detective b*ch she did a poor job. she looked neither convincing nor enthusiastic about the job.
horrible movie.",21 Bridges
362,curtquentien,"Not bad, just not great",5,15 February 2021,"Imagine a mash-up of a DC movie (but with no super hero) and a true crime drama like The Town. Although very good, there was something about the cinematography that made me think the Batman's Tumbler was going to jump into the chase scenes, maybe because it was filmed in NYC in the dark or the many overhead shots, I'm not sure.The movie as a whole was incredibly predictable, and the idea of a one super cop taking down not only the criminals, but the corrupt PD has been done far too many times. Taking down all the bad guys seemed about as quick and easy as eating a donut. As for the characters, Bozeman and Simmons were both great, but I found Miller's character to be dreadful and unnecessary. Too bad the two guys with the BMW didn't have larger roles, they were the most interesting of the bunch with their back story, which just fizzled away.Lastly the movie is quite short, maybe a good thing, but probably because there was nothing else to work with story-wise. Not a bad movie to watch once, but once is enough.",21 Bridges

This is exactly the type of ""stuff"" he makes nowadays.I would call this a TV-movie but that isn't the insult it used to be. But you can still tell right away this was directed by a TV-director! And not in a good way. The script is embarrassingly predictable. You couldn't be more by-the-numbers even if you tried. Also this is one of those movies where the casting of the supporting roles reveals some major story beats. Best thing about the movie is it's pacing and short running time.",21 Bridges

372,FigtherOfTheNightMan,Destined for Cult Status,9,25 November 2019,"If you are a fan of throwback action movies, gritty action thrillers, crime dramas or chase movies, this is the film for you. Once this film gets going, it doesn't let it's foot off the brake until the credits roll. There's a sense of urgency akin to 24, Collateral or Running Scared. The pacing is one of this film's greatest strengths.Chadwick Boseman turns in a great performance as the relentless and determined detective, Andre Davis. There are also solid performances turned in by Sienna Miller, JK Simmons and Taylor Kitsch (who should find more roles like this). Stephan James nearly steals the show.If I have a quibble with the movie, it could have taken a few more risks with the story. The plot winds up just where you think it will. They also probably didn't have to shut down Manhattan, but the ticking clock is a conceit I enjoyed. With that being said, the tight script, atmospheric score, deft action sequences and propulsive pacing should be more than enough to keep action and crime aficionados entertained. This will be one I come back to when I need to scratch that action thriller 90's vibe itch. Loved it.",21 Bridges

Even though I figured out the ending long before the end of the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed the two lead actors and their performances. What I don't understand though is the choice of Sienna Miller for her role. Could we not find an American actress that could do a NY accent better than her? It was so contrived, and her performance was so bland that I was hoping she'd be killed at some point. What did the casting director find so intriguing about her to cast her in the role? Did Harvey Weinstein help in some way? That's the only thing I could think of. Overall, I stayed awake for the film, which is high praise coming from me. lol.

386,nickotaylor,Decent but Predictable,6,26 November 2019,"Not a bad film, some good action scenes & good acting but very predictable, nothing really that I haven't seen before, felt also like the script was stretched out so much as to be honest, the film could of easily just been an hour.",21 Bridges
387,bionihockey,A fierce cop drama!,7,20 December 2019,"'21 Bridges' was an above average cop film! The action sequences were well done and the directing was impressive. The story though was a bit generic and predictable but still very enjoyable.What I didn't like. The first 10 minutes were kind of slow. I know it was introducing us Chadwick Boseman character but I found it a bit slow. Once the action starts though it get intense. The acting was okay, average at best besides Chadwick Boseman and Taylor Kitsch. The movie was also very predictable but that didn't ruin the experience for me. One nitpick, when young Chadwick was ""crying"" in the beginning his tears looked fake as hell.Now what I liked. I was very surprised on the amount of action and tension there was. The first action scene was crazy! All the gun shots felt real and rough. From that point on it was a race against time. Chadwick rocks the red and blue, he was very convincing and lifted the film on his shoulders. The trailers really didn't give away to many plot points so that was a plus. I also really liked the ending and where the story went. At one point I thought the movie was going to end and there was like another 10 minutes left. Within those 10 minutes it felt like a scene out of a Tarantino film. The film also gets really deep with the lives of police officers; the sacrifices they make to protect others. It was a great message, never forget those protecting our streets.In the end '21 Bridges' was a great cop drama! It had a great leading man, intense action, and a compelling story. I would definitely check this film out, it's worth the watch!Final verdict: 7/10That's my 2 cents!Alex Bioni",21 Bridges
388,nguyenquanghuy-34911,Better than expected,7,31 March 2020,"The plot is not too much of a surprise but it works. The acting is solid with Chadwick Boseman, you can really feel why he does what he does. Everything happens fast and action packed which won't make you bored. On the other hand, this movie won't give you the thrill you expect from a crime movie or some deep messages that you need to think about it after have watched the movie.",21 Bridges
389,jhonahtansadou,Good action thriller movie,7,2 March 2020,"Good acting. I liked the story line. The bad guys was not really tha bad guys in the end. But to prove that they have to risk there life. It is nt a movie about black or white, it is just abut corruptions and why.",21 Bridges
390,sf1924,Very thin plot line and ridiculous disregard for public safety,5,16 February 2020,"I was looking forward to watching this but it was very disappointing.If you want a mindless action flick then you could do worse, but this is an unintelligent, unoriginal plot with no twists or surprises whatsoever.The title of the film suggested that there would be a clever use of police tactics and an exciting manhunt would pursue. Spoiler alert **They just close all bridges and nothing else is mentioned about it** I don't even know why the film was titled so. They might as well have called the film ""Dogs"" as I heard more dogs barking during the film than they spent on the bridge angle.Although not a bad watch, it is so predictable and the blatant disregard for public safety was laughable. I understand the predicament the Police were in but there's no way they would spray bullets in a public place, shoot machine guns from helicopters and drive down pedestrian sidewalks all with the public watching. It was just stupid.",21 Bridges

It is really a long time since i watched such a strong classic action movie,8,25 November 2019,"When i went today to watch this movie i thought it will be an average movie and I didn't make a high expectation; But during the movie i was really shocked. It is very entertaining and thrilling. It reminded me with old classic action movies such as HEAT and The Training Day ... you will not blink throughout the movie. All the aspects were really good direction , script, music and the cinematography was really good.",21 Bridges

399,james-puder,A solid actioner that really shines,8,29 March 2021,"The movie is at it's best when it's showing us the action that takes place in NYC at night/early morning. Chadwicke Boseman is super strong as a cop who has a reputation, and Sienna Miller is brillaint in a role where she actually gets to flex her acting chops.The plot is predictable, but the character development and the portrayals by the leads make it worth putting up with. Add the excellent music, suble and subdued, and it just all works to make an excellent action film. I really enjoy Millers work, even though I often think she gets cast for her looks but here she is not relying on thse, but, rather, she shines in a role that is not glamorous.Bosmean became one of my favorite actors after watching him in 42, and he does not disappoint here. His character is tough as nails, and sharp, and everything you want in a conflicted cop who is clearly wondering what is going on. Once he figures it out, the move really takes off.",21 Bridges

408,derrickdamewood,Eh not bad,6,25 November 2019,"Yeah there are some overly dramatic spots but they didn't skimp on the action. Simple plot, simple use of detective stuff, and some good bad guys. Not bad if you've already seen Joker, Knives out, Doctor Sleep, etc.Due to the success of ""black panther/get on up"" you'll expect Chadwick Boseman to just start yelling something epic in the middle of it haha",21 Bridges

410,aemitchell-63173,Laughably bad,2,6 June 2020,"Oh dear! Good actors, but this is an appalling film. Dialogue was written by a 7 year old. One of those films that is so bad it becomes good for all the wrong reasons. At least it was relatively short!",21 Bridges
411,skeware,Kept me pleasantly entertained,8,19 December 2019,"This movie has sort of an old school vibe, proving that cinema can be very entertaining withoud big fight scenes and cgi.
Some people will say the plot is predictable, but I don't think that it was supposed that the audience understood what was going on from the very beginning. This is a kind of narrative style that I do enjoy, because events happen straightforward making the audience understand what is at stake and whatch how the protagonist figures things out on his own. There's still a twist or two, but i don't think they were made to be a big surprise and certainly not for buildind suspense.There were two or three things that felt like goofs. One was a certain apparently apple laptop in use that had windows OS, and other one a certain character that got shot in the chest but the shooter couldn't have the angle to make that shot because the scene had another character in front talking to him very close.It's a very nice movie to spent time watching, that is certain for me.",21 Bridges
412,samallensa,No panther necessary,8,29 November 2019,"I was totally surprised. It was not at all what I thought it would be. The movie delivered!. Compelling story, predictably turns, but so many surprises. Great movie!",21 Bridges
413,jandreharp,It was a great movie!,8,23 November 2019,"The people who didn't like this movie obviously watched a different movie than I did. Me and wife watched it last night and even she liked it (and she normally doesn't like these types of movies.) I thought the writing was great, the directing was great and the cast led by Chadwick was absolutely top notch. If you like a good cop chasing the bad guys kind of movie, then this is your movie!Go watch it and enjoy!",21 Bridges

418,dannyappleyard,Misleading trailer,7,12 December 2019,"21 Bridges was advertised in the trailers to be this film where Chadwick Boseman was going to chase these two cop killers through the streets of Manhattan, closing off all the bridges and subway tunnels leading out of Manhattan, where he would finally encounter them and get revenge on his dads death.
However, this was not the case. The film did not play out this way. He did in fact close off all the bridges and subway tunnels, but that was only in the first half of the film. The other half of the film consisted of Chadwick's character uncovering a conspiracy plot against the NYPD and killing some of those ""dirty cops"" who he was really close with in the entirety of the film's runtime.
Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film, it just wasn't advertised in the trailers as the film would eventually play out. 7/10 from me.",21 Bridges
419,sebschuette,Great oldschool cop movie,9,23 November 2020,"John McClane would be proud of the Action.

422,hlii-91515,Yawn,1,13 June 2020,Acting is very flat. Story is non original. Action sequences are boring. Lot of profanity ( the bark is much worse than the bite). Movie should be a tnt original. Sort of amazed that this kind of stuff is being pushed to the theatres.,21 Bridges

424,heathervthokies,Basic Plot with wasted dialogue,5,29 March 2020,"The movie was decent. It is an amped up cop chase, thin storyline with even thinner dialogue. Then the writers decided to make sure every single character had extra dialogue by wasting every other word on the f word. Just unnecessary, it distracts from the story in any movie and can ruin a thin storyline like this one.",21 Bridges

428,alexlumier,Simple and good,8,15 July 2021,"Well, as some say, the plot was simple.. But it's a classic plot that worked for years, the acting, camera work, light work (which is not something easy to achieve in the middle of the city at night time) are really good. Yes it's a simple story, but it'll able you to have a great Friday night.",21 Bridges
429,DTechtnzl,I liked it,10,3 February 2020,"I would rather say I loved it. However, although I really enjoyed it, I thought they could have done a better job to tighten up certain scenes and in order to make it an even better movie that it was. With a few tweaks, I would have loved it. Perhaps I've watched too many movies....I knew from the arrival of the first set of police to the restaurant, how this movie was going to play out.From there I was looking for the obvious telltale signs of how I knew the plot was going to unfold. To make it more exciting (and not so obvious) the directors needed to hide certain aspects of several scenes so that it kept a number of us guessing a little longer.However, despite the minor flaws, I still enjoyed the movie. As I said ... it was a good movie, but it could have been so much better.The action and pace of the movie was good. It kept me interested throughout. I though Bosemans portrayal of his character was spot on. In this movie, he's able to demonstrate a wider array of skills than in his previous 2 MCU outings. As long as he keeps selecting good characters like this, I think he has a great career.",21 Bridges
430,pythondooler,A bad episode of a Crime SHOW turned into a bad film!!!,2,9 August 2021,"The movie is terrible. There is too much badly staged violence, I think either the actors were not paid well or most of them were just too high to act, because it feels like they did not know this is going to be shown in movie theaters or they would have made some effort.Excessive use of police cars just pulling up for no reason everywhere is just as weird as blatant advertisements for the blue Gang ; this movie should have just been chopped up into police ads!!!The plot makes no sense, but the interaction between criminals are for sure even worse. The back story is just pointless so is the over decorated apartments the movies is shot in.My suggestion: Watching the paint dry gives you more adrenaline rush than this High definition overstretched public service announcement.BTW in the BLM day and age who does really watch a film made about Good Shootings? Seriously!!!",21 Bridges
431,bazcoch,Not great if I'm honest!!,5,23 July 2020,"I was looking forward to watching this, but it was a little boring and the performances weren't good.

441,ali-simaei22,Big Cliche,5,27 November 2019,The movie is a total cliche. A good cup and the res of the dirty cups. Also I think they used race to attract people to watch the movie. The African American people are shown more positive and white people are shown more dark and dirty. As always the head of the police dep is dirty and trying to cover a mess.

Finding it a very Proper, Solid, good Paced Entertaining Action Movie!
Modern well done action, but with a touch of oldschool to it as well.The shooting scenes was very well done, good choreography, weapon control, tension, and it seemed ""likely"" - though a lot of bullets in some scenes, it still wasn't just all firing and tossing rounds away in a total unrealistic way - looking at each shooting scene, a perfect balance!The top 5 actors did all good, I really enjoyed Chadwick Boseman as Andre, Stephan James and Taylor Kitch - the 2 bad guys played very well in each of their roles, not ""just"" some total lost individuals kinda types, and you actually felt sympathy with both parts (good and bad side) - Overall good casting here!.Again very proper action movie, Simple, Good, but Fine entertainment - there should be a market for more of these kind of action flicks.
First i placed 7 stars, but actually i admit giving it 8, just to promote the good job done here! :)",21 Bridges
