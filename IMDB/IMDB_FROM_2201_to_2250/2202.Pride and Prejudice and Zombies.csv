0,Leofwine_draca,Misses the mark big time,4,5 October 2017,"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is undoubtedly a bad idea for a movie, a blackly comic misfire that misses the mark time and time again. The story is to take the essence of the Jane Austen novel and add a zombie apocalypse to the mix. I thought this was a ludicrous idea when the book came out and now, having seen the film version, I can confirm that I was right.The film's idea is to basically play out the plot of the original story but add zombies into the background of every scene. The zombie effects typically incorporate cheap-looking CGI while the action sequences are mishandled by the American director, who has no feel for his material.The only decent thing about this film are the presence of a handful of supporting actors such as Charles Dance, Jack Huston, and Lena Headey who do their best to make the whole thing bearable, but their efforts are in vain. Whether it's the miscast lead - Lily James, one of those pretty faces with nothing behind it - or Sam Riley's weirdly gruff accent, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is an embarrassment all round.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
1,SnoopyStyle,non Jane Austen fans may get lost,8,16 December 2016,"During the 18th century, prosperous England was overrun by a plague of brain-eating zombies. The King retreated behind a high wall around London. The Royal Canal was built as a moat and the land between the two is called the In-Between. The landed gentry is secured behind their fortified estates. It became fashionable to train in the eastern martial arts. The higher class trained in Japan while the Bennet sisters became skilled fighters in China. Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) is put-off by the hard coldness of Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley). Her sister Jane Bennet (Bella Heathcote) is taken with Mr. Bingley but their budding relationship is broken up by Darcy. Darcy's aunt is the admired warrior Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey). Bumbling Parson Collins (Matt Smith) visits his cousin Elizabeth but she can't accept his proposal. They are visited by soldier George Wickham (Jack Huston) who reveals Darcy's evil history.This movie faces a tough problem. There are people who like Jane Austen. There are people who like zombies. There are few people where these two circles of interest intersect. I found the insistent to pull these Pride characters into this world while maintaining their inherent traits compelling. It has zombies but the best action scene happens without zombies. The fight between Elizabeth and Darcy encapsulates their relationship perfectly. The climatic fight against Wickham is less compelling. It's visually less interesting outside in a random field. Overall, I think people unfamiliar with Pride will get lost and Pride fans are not naturally zombie fans. This is a tough sell.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
2,Prismark10,Gordon Bennett!,4,26 February 2019,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies should had been a fun mash up but it takes itself too seriously.Burr Steers seems to be overawed by the Jane Austen novel itself and was maybe too respectful.It is love in the picture pretty 19th century England. The Bennett sisters have learned martial arts in the far east because surrounding them are zombies.Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) is fascinated by the humourless and disapproving Mr Darcy (Sam Reilly.) He is a dedicated zombie killer who uses flies to detect the undead.Mr Wickham is one of the charmers of the Bennett sisters who has sinister intentions. He believes a breed of pig eating zombies and humans should be living side by side.The action scenes are a bit of a disappointment. The tone is uncertain, it should had been bizarre and funny. Matt Smith gets it right as Reverend Collins, others are just too deadpan.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
3,claudio_carvalho,Brainless and Silly Destruction of a Wonderful Romance,6,29 May 2016,"""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen is among the most beautiful romances ever. The 2005 cinema version directed by Joe Wright is a gem of the cinema industry. The bad taste and lack of respect of ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" by Burr Steers is impressive, destroying the wonderful romance with a brainless and silly version. However, the high-quality of the production, direction, performances, art direction, costumes and lighting is totally unexpected and unusual. It is conflictive, but my vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Orgulho e Preconceito e Zumbis"" (""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"")",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
4,nogodnomasters,The ultimate battle,10,10 November 2017,"The title pretty much says it all. The Bennet girls have been instructed in the orient in various martial arts, and when sisters fight, well, you get the picture. The film was more drama and romance than simple zombie fighting. Men propose at the drop of a hat.This production follows in a series of zombie films based on novels, ""My Fair Zombie"", ""Warm Bodies"" (""Romeo and Juliet""), that Asylum ""Sleeping Beauty"" thing, and ""Twilight"" with Kristen Stewart. Clearly this Zombie film had a serious budget. The movie followed the novel rather well (minus that one thing) as Lily James turned in an excellent performance unaccustomed to ""B"" movies.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
5,kosmasp,Classic meets ... Blood,6,25 January 2017,"You may have heard about this and I guess there are many others that took either well known novels or history figures and webbed a horror theme around them (take Ab Lincoln Vampire Hunter for example). Does this work though? Or is it just a one joke thing that runs out of gas quickly even before it starts? I'd say the former.Of course that is in the eye of the beholder, but you can have fun with this if you let yourself. Of course if the obvious is not appealing to you, than you probably won't be convinced during the movie either. A nice touch is the strong woman fighter in this. Not a damsel in distress by any means! And that's good! I love it. Still this is not going to be a classic or anything, but is enough for an entertaining evening",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
6,BA_Harrison,A genre mash-up failure.,4,24 December 2016,"The book might have been a success thanks to the novelty factor of its unusual genre mash-up but I still believe that most zombie fans couldn't care less about Pride and Prejudice and, likewise, Pride and Prejudice fans couldn't give two hoots about zombies. I'm a zombie addict, and found that P&P&Z featured way too much boring costume drama (played completely straight by everyone but Matt 'Dr. Who' Smith) and not nearly enough of the brain-munching living dead (and what we do get is strictly PG-13).Working slightly in the film's favour are some fine young fillies as the Bennett sisters, with the lovely Lily James as Elizabeth being particularly fetching, director Burr Steers making the most of his star's physical appeal, paying particular attention to her heaving bosom. But as nice as the rise and fall of James's chest and the occasional flash of stockinged thigh is to behold, it doesn't make up for the lacklustre undead action and dreary period drama.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
7,paul_haakonsen,Pride and Prejudice but where are the zombies...?,4,21 April 2017,"Granted, I haven't read the ""Pride & Prejudice"" book, nor have I delved into the ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" that followed, and that is even despite the fact that I do enjoy everything zombie. So I am not sure how true director Burr Steers remained to the actual book.I eventually got around to sit down to watch the 2016 movie version of ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"", but I didn't have any expectations to it, given the fact that I wasn't familiar with the story in any way.And while this movie sure does have a good production value, it just falls through on the things that appeal to me; and that would be the zombies. There just simply weren't enough of them, and they were nothing more than backdrop elements to the story.The movie shuffled along at a slow, halting gait, so at least something zombiesque was here. But the storyline was just too slow and too boring to really appeal to me. Nothing much happened, and what did happen didn't really thrill me, because I cared nothing for the characters in the story.As for the characters, well they were one-dimensional and could easily have been replaced with cardboard cut-outs. There was absolutely no depth or personalities to the characters portrayed in ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"". So if the characters in the movie were copied from the book, then the book surely makes for a tedious and uneventful read.The acting, on the other hand, was adequate. Taking into consideration that the acting talents had next to nothing to work with in terms of storyline, script and characters.They had managed to capture the essence and feel of the time period quite nicely, in terms of costumes, wardrobe, props, sets, etc. And that was a nice treat to witness.And while the absence of zombies was terrifying, it was at least a treat that they did the zombie make-up and special effects adequately enough. Granted, it is not as gory and grotesque as what is seen in ""The Walking Dead"", for example, it worked out well enough for the premise of the movie.All in all, then ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" wasn't an outstanding movie for me. And it is not one that I will be watching again, even with my fondness for all things zombie.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
8,Coventry,Only a terrific idea on paper...,3,26 November 2018,"I'm a man who likes his horror raw, shocking and extremely bloody. I can also handle pretty much everything else in terms of cinema, but I'm truly petrified of one thing: having to watch movies like ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Atonement"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"" with my wife. I simply always fail to stay awake during those incredibly lengthy, tedious and dreadfully sentimental historical costume dramas. Therefore, the idea of Burr Steers' ""Price and Prejudice and Zombies"" seemed so appealing when I first encountered it! It has the romantic aspects and contemporary costume & set designs to please my beloved wife, and at least I could seek comfort in the fact there will be zombie mayhem after every sappy and melodramatic interlude. Giving this one an optimistic chance nevertheless became one of the bigger mistakes of the century, as ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is just as boring as the traditional Jane Austen adaptations and, moreover, a disgraceful entry in the horror genre, what with its horridly inept CGI-effects and anti-menacing zombies. Apart from the ""...and Zombies"" that is nonchalantly added in the title, Steers' ambitious project solely contains two reasonably imaginative gimmicks. Charles Dance's five beautiful and eligible-for-marriage daughters are all masters in Oriental martial arts techniques, and the noble but arrogant Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) uses ordinary flies as a primitive but highly efficient method to detect newly infected living dead people. Everything else is lame and derivative guff that is neither funny, nor exciting. I still think mixing two opposite genres or cinematic styles can work out perfectly fine, but for this to work, the writer and director must demonstrate deep respect and knowledge of both genres, which Burr Steers obviously lacked to do. In the competent hands of George A. Romero, for example, and with the much-needed help of Tom Savini in the make-up department, the potential outcome of such a genre salad could have been fabulous (perhaps)!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
9,zardoz-13,"Lots of Pride, Little Prejudice, and Zombies Galore!!!",8,8 February 2016,"Wicked, witty, and wonderful describes ""Charlie St. Cloud"" writer & director Burr Steers' zombified version of Jane Austen's venerable 19th century novel ""Pride and Prejudice,"" an oft-told cinematic comedy of manners about courtship in Regency-era England. ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" author Seth Grahame-Smith surprised everybody in 2009 when he appropriated Austin's public domain masterpiece, inserted zombies, and ascended to number three on the New York Times' bestseller list. Steers' horror spoof spectacle ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" succeeds in harmonizing the formal tableaux of a classy BBC period costumer with the brain-munching frenzy of a zombie melodrama. Mind you, this swashbuckling, PG-13 rated, parody of Austen's second novel not only maintains a straight-face throughout its outlandish 108 minutes, but it also doesn't ask audiences to endure gratuitous quarts of blood and gore. No, ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" doesn't generate gross-out levels equivalent to a gut-gnawing George Romero ghoul fest. Nobody is torn asunder by voracious zombies, and only a couple of heads vanish in earsplitting explosions of gunfire. Nevertheless, multitudes of zombies assemble for the occasion, and some appear as provocative as they are intelligent. Indeed, the undead in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" can enunciate with surprising eloquence. They can also set traps. Steers doesn't let the George Romero elements overshadow the amorous Jane Austen affairs that remain an essential part in the proceedings. The Bennet sisters are still out to land husbands, but don't mistake them for delicate damsels-in-distress. Skilled martial artists who learned their craft in China, these daredevil dames can wield either swords or revolvers with devastating pugnacity. Occasionally, when things wax extremely violent, Steers averts his cameras so we don't witness the mayhem in all of its gruesome glory. Impressive production values, a serious-minded cast, and a subtle sense of humor make everything a lot of fun in what might otherwise have boiled down to a campy cauldron. As ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" unfolds, we learn that nobody knows precisely what precipitated the zombie pandemic. Presumably, British naval trade brought about this apocalypse. Indeed, some lay the blame at the feet of the French. Writer and director Burr Steers relies on clever, old-school, illustrated, pop-up storybook type narration to relay the mandatory exposition. Zombies have infested England, and most everybody has taken refuge in London behind tall walls and a massive moat. The agricultural land between London's walls and the Royal Moat is designated as the In-Between. When the zombies storm the bridges across the moat, a frantic King George closes all but one bridge. Eventually, people are allowed to inhabit the In-Between, and landowners reopen their estates. The first character we encounter is the officious Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley of ""Maleficent"") as he rides out on horseback to investigate a zombie sighting at the elegant estate of the affluent Mrs. Featherstone. Everything seems tranquil enough when Darcy arrives at the estate. He uncorks a vial that contains carrion flies. These buzzing insects are drawn to dead tissue, and they expose an apparently innocent fellow whose wrist has been nibbled by a zombie. Meantime, we learn that wealthy landowner, Mr. Bennet (Charles Dance of ""Last Action Hero""), who has no sons, has sent his quintet of darling daughters--Elizabeth (Lily James of ""Cinderella""), Jane (Bella Heathcote of ""Dark Shadows""), Kitty (Suki Waterhouse of ""Insurgent""), Lydia (Ellie Bamber of ""The Falling""), and Mary (Millie Brady of ""Legend"")--to China to learn martial arts from Shaolin masters so they can provide a measure of protection. They can cavort as nimbly on the dance floor as they can engage in combat with flesh-eating zombies. When the Bingley family occupies a nearby estate, young Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth of ""Noah"") throws a party and invites the Bennets. Bingley sets his sights on Jane. At the party, Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy, and these two circle each other like adversaries. Initially, Elizabeth abhors Darcy, but they grow to appreciate each other. While they are warming up to each other, Elizabeth has to discourage the amorous advances of her cousin, Parson Collins (Matt Smith of ""Terminator Genisys""), and gravitates to a dashing young army lieutenant, George Wickham (Jack Huston of ""American Hustle""), who shares her hostility toward Darcy. One close-call with the zombie horde follows another, and the undead threaten London again with superior forces. Our three protagonists—Elizabeth, Darcy, and Wickham—find themselves on the wrong side of the single remaining bridge across the Royal Moat when the King decides to demolish it to foil a final zombie invasion.Generally, the best spoofs take themselves seriously despite their sidesplitting subject matter. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" doesn't constitute a one-joke novelty item aside from its plague of zombies. Director Burr Steers never lets matters get too cockamamie. In an interview, Steers explained, ""the big wink of the movie wasn't to wink, but to play it straight."" Appropriately, Steers doesn't ridicule the Austen classic but respects it. As the lovers, lead actors Lily James and Sam Riley generate genuine chemistry. Although nobody deliberately plays the material to evoke laughter, former ""Dr. Who"" actor Matt Smith has a field day as the primary source of comic relief. Smith's Parson Collins is hilarious from start to finish, and he'll keep you in stitches. The make-up for the zombies looks imaginative with their withered and decayed faces. The producers have spared no expense to make ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" look like the $28-multi-million dollar film that it is with its verdant scenery and sprawling estates. Steers dispenses with the usual lessons in zombie killing. When the zombies attack, the Bennett sisters blast away with their rifles or slash away with their swords. Interestingly, Steers differentiates between good and evil zombies. Good zombies prefer pigs' brains, and they don't pose a threat to humanity. Comparatively, evil zombies crave human brains and cannot stuff enough down their gullets. Altogether, ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" qualifies as a tastefully horrific send-up, graced with superb performances, feverish heroics, and delightful romantic interludes.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Cheeky adaptation of the hybrid of classic and campy horror based on the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith depicts Jane Austen's romantic era characters amidst a plague of the undead with the Bennet gals kicking righteous zombie ass with blazing mad skills and coquettish polite manners.

13,neil-476,A hoot,8,19 February 2016,"Elizabeth Bennett, the oldest of five sisters, takes issue with her mother's shallow attempts to marry her off, believing that love and self-esteem are much more important than simply marrying a wealthy and allegedly worthy man, such as the rather stand-offish and disdainful Mr Darcy. Of course, the fact that she and her sisters have undertaken the Chinese ant-zombie training rather than the more socially acceptable Japanese training doesn't help.So this bloke had a brilliant idea: why not take Jane Austen's Victorian novel of romance and social commentary, and mash it up with zombies? The novel was a success (and spawned a number of other genre-mixing novels), so a movie adaptation was inevitable. And it succeeds, primarily because it plays both elements with an absolutely straight face: it's a pretty solid zombie movie, and it also plays fair with the themes of Austen's original.The cast are mostly quite good, with Lily James, as Elizabeth, being impressively athletic when dismantling zombies as well as sporting a bosom which heaves spectacularly in more emotional moments. Sam Riley's Darcy is a bit stiff (ooh, Matron!) but then, he's supposed to be. My only quibble is that some of the geography, zombie history, and martial arts training history were whizzed through so quickly that they were a bit difficult to follow. Otherwise, this movie is peculiar, but rather good fun.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
14,ferguson-6,5 risky prom dates,6,4 February 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those high school Literature teachers struggling to get their students to embrace the classics from writers like Jane Austen, this movie won't help much. However, chances are good that those same students will enjoy this blending of 19th century British class warfare with ""The Walking Dead"" – likely one of their favorite shows. The zombie apocalypse has landed in the middle of Austen's prim and proper story, including the repressed attraction between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.Anyone expecting the serious undertones of Ms. Austen's1813 novel will be disappointed  but the title should have provided a pretty solid hint. While her characters and general story line act as a structure here, it's really based on Seth Grahame-Smith's YA hit novel  delivering zombie battles and often zany humor. Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) directs his own adapted screenplay and seems to really be having a great time – right along with his talented cast. The sets, costumes, dialogue and fight scenes work together to create an unusual movie experience that will generate plenty of laughs while not dwelling on the zombies or violence (it is PG-13). Expect most critics to destroy this one because it's made simply for fun, not for art.Of course, any Pride and Prejudice spin-off (even one with zombies) must pay particular attention to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. It turns out that Elizabeth and her four sisters are highly trained warriors raised to survive against the undead. It's even clearer for Mr. Darcy as he is billed as a zombie hunter and protector of Mr. Bingley, the rich bachelor hooked on Jane Bennett. Things get muddled by the devious Mr. Wickham, a focused Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and especially the flamboyant fop Parson Collins. The interactions between these characters bounce between loyalty, romantic attraction, emotional turmoil and hand-to-hand combat  with enough comedic elements that most viewers will find plenty of opportunities to laugh.The talented cast is all in. They play it mostly straight (with one major exception) to achieve the balance between somber and silly. Lily James (""Downton Abbey"") and Sam Riley (On the Road, 2012) are both fun to watch as Elizabeth and Darcy. They are the film's best fighters  both with swords and words. Bella Heathcoate (Dark Shadows, 2012) is ""the pretty one"" Jane, who is wooed by Douglas Booth (Noah, 2014) as Mr. Bingley. Lena Headey (""Game of Thrones"") makes an impression in her limited screen time as an eye-patched Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Jack Huston (""Boardwalk Empire"") is well cast as Wickham. Screen veterans Charles Dance and Sally Phillips take on the role of parents to the five Bennett daughters, but it's Matt Smith (""Dr Who""), who turns the film on its ear with his unconventional twist on the oddball Parson Collins, who pretty much steals each of his scenes. He had those in the theatre laughing out loud more than a few times.Pity is the word that comes to mind for any young man who takes these Bennett girls to the prom  or more likely to one of the societal balls. The weapons hidden under their formal gowns offer fair warning to zombies and handsy suitors alike. It's this element of strong women (physically and emotionally) that might even allow Ms. Austen to appreciate what's happened to her characters  were she alive to see it.Even though the film offers plenty of fun with laughs and action and romance, let's hope it doesn't kick off a new zombie-adaptation trend. Here are a few titles that we hope never see the big screen: Sense and Sensibilities and Zombies, War and Peace and Zombies, Crime and Punishment and Zombies, The Old Zombie and the Sea, Wuthering Zombies, Romeo and Juliet and Zombies, and Alice's Adventure in Zombieland.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Decent enough but does have some flaws,7,5 February 2017,"During a ravenous zombie outbreak, a family of sisters trained in zombie eradication practices finds that their struggle is hardened by the constant need for them to settle down with an officer also fighting off the creatures and must fight their feelings to stave off the zombies.This one was an enjoyable enough effort. One of the more impressive elements here is the fact that this one manages to effectively intertwine the actual story into the middle of a zombie outbreak. The facet of their search that drives the main story, complete with each of the behavioral outbursts of each of the sisters that's brought over without any changes or updates, makes the period setting and generally decadent Victorian-era setting feel much more lived-in and comfortable than what should be considered for such a film like this. The constant yearning for stability in terms of suitors and the need for their comfortable surroundings is taken from the book and gives this a decidedly decent framework upon which to set-up the zombie outbreak in that universe. Those are of far-more impressive work here with the film really shining with it's action scenes here as the fact that the period-setting forces hand- to-hand tactics and swordplay rather than more traditional gunplay which makes this one quite enjoyable. The first battles in the family house where they crash the reception and do battle against them in the dance-hall makes for a nice start, while the incidental battles throughout the woods surrounding their house make for a stellar lead-in for the finale which has all kinds of great fun. The battle in the cemetery where the dead are shown coming back to life gets in some rather fun pieces, while the main brawl in the church basement with the freed zombies running loose gives this one quite a fun battle, while the brawling out in the fields and down into the bridge makes for a wholly enjoyable spectacle that makes for a fine time here. These here do hold this one up enough, although it does have some minor flaws with it. The biggest issue is the fact that there's just not a whole lot other zombie action within this one, tending to follow along too closely to the situations in the book rather than the plot set-up which would require more action to come from this storyline, and that does make the film feel far more stretched out than it really needs to be because it's inclusion of these story set-ups creates quite a rather downbeat and altered set- up that doesn't achieve what it could've. As well, the fact that this one tends to be quite a rather close interpretation might be quite hard for some to follow, with the chaste and rigid society structure and romance angles makes for quite a troubling effort to get through, which is quite a problem here. Otherwise, this one wasn't quite as bad as it could've been.Rated PG-13: Violence.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Whenever it blends the horror with the original story it's quite delightful. Liked the use of 19th Century dialog while fighting. The filming is beautifully done with sumptuous country houses and landscapes and costumes.Lily James is perfect as heroine Elizabeth Bennett and she is both sweet and feisty. Bella Heathcote is pretty as Jane Bennett. Lena Headey is amusing as the disapproving aunt. Douglas Booth is pretty as Bingley, Jack Huston is caddish as Wickham, Sam Riley is suitably standoffish as Darcy if not handsome.

17,trashgang,on the view of horror there isn't any,5,7 June 2016,"Just like Crimson Peak (2015) I was looking forward to see this one, original concept. A romantic zombie story. But just like Crimson Peak who was sold as a Gothic horror throwback the romance was more important then the horror.Here we do have five sisters, looking gorgeous and are all alone but are excellent fighters who together tear down the rage of zombies until the D'arcy's arrive. And let that happen from the first minutes, so a romance do build, you know, the one getting working out fine and another one who can't tell they are in love, until the final of this flick. Did I spoil, sadly not, you could see it coming from the beginning.Nevertheless, the zombies do look fine but the problem on part of the horror is the fact that there isn't any. When zombies attack they are being stabbed or decapitated but it's all done off- camera. So no red stuff to spot anywhere even not on swords being used to kill zombies. Just watch one scene with a bomb being thrown towards zombies, they explode and the only thing you see is mud flying. Really? PG-13 I do call that.So this is pure a romantic story in Victorian London. Not one bit of suspense of horror to see. As a love story it's okay but as a horror it doesn't fit that label.Some do see humor in it, I didn't, maybe the vicar I can agree.And still a lot of people do watch this flick, yes, I know why, having people in it from the much acclaimed Games Of Thrones (Charles Dance and Lena Headey) it's reason why people are picking this up. Can't say that the acting wasn't okay, it was, but as a satisfying flick (in the horror genre) it wasn't. Open ending, ready for part 2 if this is a success...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
18,KineticSeoul,"I wouldn't see it again, but it's a alright watch",7,16 March 2016,"Now some may take shots at this movie for altering a classic novel. But to me this is more like the story taking place in a alternate universe. Kind of like the Marvel Earth-161 to Marvel Zombies universe. At least they didn't try to modernize the book by adding pop culture references and such. It's still a 19th century British drama, that doesn't try to go in the more serious direction. Which actually made it work, since it goes in a more fun direction over the overly artistic style. They made the right decision by going with it in that direction. ""The Last Witch Hunter"" suffered from it trying to be so darn serious. So I liked the direction they took with this one, with it's comedic elements and humorous banters. It still covers most of the important aspect of the classic novel, except there is a zombie plague and that is one of the source of it's conflict. Watching this movie was like watching ""Marvel 1602"" the comic book with familiar character except in a bit of a different scenario. Mainly because it has to do with the characters dealing with the zombie plague and fighting a battle against the zombies. If you are looking for a artistic, in depth and clever film you will be disappointed. If your looking for a alright, fast-paced and silly take on Jane Austen novel you might think of this is a okay watch. The reason why this movie won't do so well with some audiences is because it won't reach out to the audiences that are looking for the artistic writing of the original and some audiences that is just up for a mindless zombie killing movie. Because it takes a lot of the elements from the original writing by Jane Austen. Overall, this is a movie that can just go with it and take it for what it is. The casts also did a fine job of portraying their characters in this setting. This sort reminded me of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" except the fight choreography wasn't as good.7/10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
19,Hellmant,A most enjoyable filmgoing experience!,8,11 February 2016,"'PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES': Four Stars (Out of Five)A zombie rom-com horror flick; based on the 2009 novel, of the same name, by Seth Grahame-Smith. The movie, like the book, spoofs the classic 1813 novel 'Pride and Prejudice', by Jane Austin. This story deals with five sisters, in 19th century England, struggling to find wealthy husbands; as well as defend their home, from vicious zombies. It was written and directed by Burr Steers (who also helmed the 2002 indie cult classic 'IGBY GOES DOWN'), and it was co- produced by Natalie Portman (who was originally set to star in the film). The movie stars Lily James, Sam Riley, Bella Heathcote, Jack Huston, Sally Phillips, Charles Dance, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith and Lena Headey. I found it to be a most enjoyable filmgoing experience.The film is set in 19th century England; where an outbreak, of a deadly zombie virus, has consumed most of the land. Mr. Bennet (Dance) has raised his five daughters to defend themselves; from the bloodthirsty creatures. While Mrs. Bennet (Phillips) just wants her daughters to marry wealthy businessmen. To her delight, the rich Bingley family moves in next door. Elizabeth (James) and Jane Bennet (Heathcote), look like they've found ideal suitors; but zombies threaten to spoil everything.The movie is surprisingly hilarious, that's what I most enjoyed about it; it's full of witty humor and clever dialogue. The performances are all decent as well; especially Lily James, in the lead. The action, and zombie gore, leaves something to be desired though; and the horror elements, of the film, are actually where the film falls short, surprisingly (maybe partially because it was made for a PG-13 audience). It's still a lot of fun though, and sure to become a beloved cult classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

22,bowmanblue,A one trick flick,6,13 February 2017,"I was in two minds as to whether this film was for me. On the one hand, I've watched every zombie film ever made (even the really bad ones that most people hate!). On the other hand, I've never seen Jane Austin's 'Pride and Prejudice' and I'm guessing she wasn't made a producer on this filmic adaptation (see, that's how much I know about that side of the genre – she is still alive, right?).In case you're not aware from the kind of self-explanatory title 'Pride and Prejudice with Zombies' this is a kind of mash up based on the classic tale, only throwing the undead into the mix for er comedy's sake I guess. I saw a few reviews of the film and the general take was that (believe it or not) it was actually quite a faithful version of the original text. And, by that I'm saying that it keeps to the original story's structure – even though I haven't reads it I'm pretty there weren't armies of flesh-eating ghouls rampaging through the Home Counties in Jane Austin's original vision. However, because I've never read the source material (or watched anything with Colin Firth in) I can't really comment on how accurate the story really is. All I know is that every once in a while, a load of zombies turn up and start trying to eat people, then the corset-wearing starlets all suddenly turn into Milla Jovovich from the 'resident Evil' franchise and start hacking the zombies to death with comparative ease (and stylish visual camera work).And that's about it really. It's a period piece interspersed with bits of zombie-slaughter. Yes, it's quite funny that a classic work of literature has been 'reimagined' in this way and the genres mixed, but, once you get over the initial cleverness of it all, there really isn't enough left for anyone. My mum loves Pride and Prejudice, but I can't see her really wanting to sit through this film. I love zombie films, but once the passing novelty of a 'period zombie film' had faded (and it does quite quickly) there was nothing here that I hadn't really already seen before.Basically, if you're looking for a period piece, watch a 'proper' adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. If you want a zombie film, watch 'The Walking Dead' or one of George R Romero's original trilogy. This is the sort of film that you could watch the trailer and see all the best bits included.However, although I'm probably sounding like I totally hated the film, I didn't. It's not a bad film, just not as original as it wants to be (and I wished it was!). Plus you have Matt Smith. Now I never was that fussed for him as a Doctor Who, but I thought every line he delivered was done with great comic timing and he really did lighten the mood considerably. Not bad, just a bit forgettable.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
23,ThomasDrufke,"Less Pride, Less Prejudice, More Zombies",6,6 February 2016,"Like most people, when I heard about Pride and Prejudice and Zombies being turned into a film, I scoffed. Just the very idea of it seemed ridiculous. But like every idea, with the right talent involved, it can turn out just fine. The film is directed by Burr Steers, who worked on the classics 17 Again and Charlie St. Cloud. Okay perhaps there's a little sarcasm there, but I actually happen to think he did a fine job with P+P+Z. With some surprisingly good visuals, a well developed history behind the story, and some great action sequences, I had a fun time with the film.Lily James stars as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy. James captures the essence of Bennet's personality while also giving the new bada** side of her. The idea that Mr. Bennet trained his daughters from birth to defend themselves against the undead is a great twist. Plus, having Charles Dance play the part is definitely a welcomed bonus. The important aspect to take away from the Bennet girls is that they are not damsel in distresses or clichéd female characters at all. In fact, quite often the saving is done by the Bennet's themselves. Mr. Darcy on the other-hand, is as stiff of a character as ever. I know the point of the character is to not show emotion, and Elizabeth says he ""feels less than the unfeeling"", but I'm just not interested in a character like that. Nor does his performance bring more to the role than what is asked. All of this contributes to the fact that the romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy never feels right. Really, Elizabeth is one of the only characters you care about at all, and end up rooting for. However, Matt Smith as Parton Collins is terrific and steals almost every scene he's in.I enjoyed all of the little changes they made to the story and switching the gender roles, especially a particular fight sequence between Elizabeth and Darcy. Though, sometimes the appearances of the zombies come few and far between. There are definitely some jump scares, but I can't say I would have moved if the sound design wouldn't have been so abrupt and bombastic. I think overall, it does what it set out to do, and that is to pull off an interesting twist on the classic love tale, even with that romance is actually rather weak.+Great action+Cinematography and landscape was set up well+Matt Smith+Lily James kicks butt-Romance is iffy-Sam Riley brings nothing new to the role of Mr. Darcy6.5/10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I have never seen/read the actual Pride & Prejudice movie so I can not tell how much is taken from that movie/book. I am also not a huge zombie movie fan so this had a few things going against it for me. I went in hoping for a movie like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter; it was not. The action was good in this and that aspect was entertaining, on the other hand the zombie aspect seemed to be tossed in as an after thought. For me at least there was too much Pride & Prejudice, and not enough action. Some of the performances felt flat and bored.

This was the case with Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her sisters (Bella Heathcote, Suki Waterhouse, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady).The undead, however, are not Elizabeth's only adversary as she has found an infuriating rival in zombie-hunter Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley).Not as over-the-top as one would expect a pairing of Jane Austin and the living dead to be, P+P+Z is also not as insipid either.

This was based on that, a multi-starrer film, but the lack of star value let down the film. This is the film with a familiar plot, in addition to that zombies were there, but that was not enough. The big names from the cast would have pulled the film out of the box office disaster if it had one or two. But still I think this film was okay, an acceptable with awesome production and performances.It ended like there will be a sequel, but now I don't think there's going to be one. The story was kind of predictable. Well, I did predict, particularly the character Wickham. Though I was more curious about the Zombies, like how it was going to be used in the narration. I must say, they were excellent. I mean they were not given any big preference, but theirs part indeed helped to build a nice plot. Pretty well composed stunts. I mean carefully, without strong blood and gore, so they got PG13 and warning for the violences.I think the film critics overreacted like usual. They're like the sheep herds, they follow one another and given verdict for this as a bad flick. But as a film fanatic, I don't think it is worth neglecting, especially if you are a fan of the original story. In the todays world, the critics are a bunch of circus clowns.

29,TheMovieDiorama,Pride & Prejudice & Zombies & Swords & Martial Arts & Just...urghhhh.,4,27 October 2018,"Suffice to say, I didn't enjoy this. No point dancing around the inevitable conclusion. This just didn't work for me. Now, I'm sure the source material parodies Austen's original novel much more successfully than this adaptation does. Or, alternatively, the book may not sit right with me either. Like the undead, let's dissect this mediocre mess. Utilising the same characters, Elizabeth Bennett is caught in a love triangle but must also fight for survival against a horde of zombies. Hertfordshire has never looked so appetising. Flourishing with frocks, corsets and daggers strapped to provocative thighs. The authentic costume design is a stand out and certainly captures the period setting of rural England. The acting was good, particularly from James who continues to impress. So, why didn't I like it? Well, for me, the blend of genres didn't work and were unbalanced. By tagging 'Zombies' at the end of an already infamous title, one would expect the undead to take precedent and be at the forefront. Alas, the period romance took priority. Which would be absolutely fine if the actual adaptation of the 'Pride & Prejudice' story was decent. It's not. The romance, especially between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, was more lifeless than the eponymous monsters. Riley was an incorrect casting choice and felt out of place. Smith provides the comic relief, and it seriously doesn't work. The story never feels involving, and it's impossible to not think about the several other adaptations that are significantly more engaging. However, the real issue that gets under my skin, are the zombies themselves. They talk. They go to church hearings. They disguise themselves as humans. I mean, call me old fashioned, but I like my zombies slow. I like them groaning. I like them actually being in a film for more than ten minutes. Practically none of it worked for me. Yes, it's watchable and is paced reasonably well. But the genres didn't blend and consequently produced a highly ineffective adaptation.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

This one is between a Jane Austen book and a Zombie movie. It seems that there is a zombie situation in London during the 1700's, that causes people to take there daughters to China to learn the martial arts and then come back to London so that they can fight the zombie apocalypse-at least that is what one guy does. Lily is the oldest daughter and unlike her 4 sisters, who spend their free time trying to find a husband, Lily enjoys being an independent woman. That is until Sam, a dashing zombie killer, shows up and she starts getting the flutters. Then another handsome stranger, Jack, shows up and her hormones really start going crazy. Of course, she does have to fight attacking zombies, even at fancy dances, so that helps keep her thoughts off love. Matt plays Lily's cousin and Lena plays a sort of famous zombie killer with only one eye-it was taken in battle. I think what makes this movie interesting is that it is humorous but it plays the non-zombie parts straight. You know, two different social classes trying to find love. As the end credits start, there is a scene that sets things up for a possible sequel- depending on how much money this one makes, obviously. It's rated ""PG-13"" for zombie violence and some sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.

In this version of 18th Century England, the countryside has been ravaged by a zombie outbreak. But amid the carnage and eating of brains, life goes on and young women must endeavor to marry well. To better survive the ravages of the undead, anyone with means sends their children to the orient to learn fighting arts. The wealthy send their children to Japan, and the wise send their children to China. The Bennet girls are alumni of the Shaolin temple. And where in previous incarnations of Jane Austin young ladies are playing harpsichord and doing needlepoint, the young ladies of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies are seen sharpening swords and cleaning flintlock pistols. They're also seen training for and engaging in combat with the legions of the walking dead. Sign me the F-Up .Yes the action sequences get a solid 9 out of 10. And the special effects are equally as good. But the truth is this movie is absolutely hilarious. It's funny because aside from adding zombies, kenjutsu and shaolin boxing, the writers kept everything else as faithful to Jane Austin as possible. I have seen Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen quite a few times and much of the dialogue is identical, indicating that both versions stayed close to Jane Austin's original text. When real dialogue from the Pride and Prejudice is given while girls are cleaning muskets and sparring, it becomes gut wrenchingly hilarious.

36,kirbylee70-599-526179,Another Twisted Classic,7,15 June 2016,"It hasn't been that long since movie goers were treated to the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's turn on our famous president with ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER. Grahame-Smith has written several novels now that take a well-known subject or book and adds something supernatural to it. That LINCOLN was the first to be made into a film is surprising since the book this film is based on was published first. But with the success of that first film this one has been made. But is that a good thing or bad? The book and film take their source material from the famed classic novel by Jane Austen that focused on the morality and lifestyles of the landed gentry in England, focusing on a family whose daughters are seeking matrimonial partners. As if that wasn't enough of a story this time around the setting is altered in a world where a zombie plague has taken on most of England and those that have survived not only have to deal with the day to day life of noble men and women but the chance of getting eaten by zombies as well.The Bennet family has five daughters all at an age where they are ripe for marriage. Elizabeth, the second oldest child, has the possibility of being courted by Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr. Bingley who is interested in Elizabeth's older sister Jane. As the courting goes back and forth it also includes Parson Collins, a cousin of the Bennets who has his eye on Elizabeth as well. If this wasn't enough an ex-friend of Mr. Darcy, Mr. Wickham, also has eyes for Elizabeth.Mr. Bingley throws a ball for the countryside and all attend only to have it interrupted by a zombie attack. Rather than become the demure ladies that are expected the Bennet sisters are fierce warriors capable of taking care of not only themselves but those around them as well. Armed to the teeth they take down zombies left and right during the attack.A traitor to his/her own kind exist among the loaded gentry and has sided with the zombies in the hope of some sort of co-existence between the living and the undead. The zombies are fairly harmless until the taste human blood and can exist on pig's blood. But the chances of them never being exposed and what would happen after are the main fear of the remaining humans.So the story here basically moves back and forth between a romance and horror film with comedic elements surrounding both. Does it work? In some cases but for the most part this film has jumped on the zombie bandwagon as the genre is fading from sight. With the exception of the still popular THE WALKING DEAD zombies have once more fallen out of favor and have grown tedious rather than horrifying. The same holds true for the gore effects that accompany these films. They may be well done and offer a few new sights for gore fans here but for the most part they've become boring.The movie has a nice look to it and the set design and costuming are top notch. Unfortunately due to the subject matter my guess is that Oscar will not come calling for those who worked in those departments here though no matter how good a job they've done. The cinematography is excellent and we get clear views of all that goes on even though most evening shots inside are illuminated in the scene by candles only. The acting is well done by all involved and the direction is fine. But in the end it still feels as if something is missing.I will say that my biggest complaint was the sound. Once again we have a movie where every sound involved is blasting from the speakers with the exception of dialogue, the one thing that we want to hear above the rest and as clear as possible. My viewing experience with this film ended up with subtitles running throughout just so I could know what the actors were saying. For some reason this seems to be the norm rather than the exception these days with most Hollywood films. I remember reading how Robert Altman was hailed when he championed this sort of sound mix beginning with his film MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER. For me it becomes a distraction rather than something that helps in developing a mood or setting.Some will enjoy this movie because they love Jane Austen and the romantic novels of her time. Some will love it because they still crave zombie films. And some will find it interesting to watch and see how the two genres are combined, one of the higher points of the film and the novels. In the end though the movie is one worth watching but not something I think I would want to keep around and watch over and over again.

The actors and production values are all of Downtown Abbey quality, though I may have enjoyed the genre mash-up more if the zombie action had gone for a hard R-rating instead of a tepid PG-13. Seeing Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy drenched in blood, as if they'd stepped off of set of ""Martyrs"" or ""The Descent,"" would have given the film a far more jarring of effect and possibly would have carried the concept for it's almost 2-hour running time, particularly if the violence and zombie action had gradually built to a wild ""Dead Alive"" type of over-the-top climax.

This made the ending as just below mediocrity as it hasn't have sufficient significance in the story all along. Acting wise, I think Lily James and Sam Riley did enough for their characters, although I blame the story for the lacking of character development.

42,rgkarim,"Nice Blend, but editing flaws and dull action take away",6,7 February 2016,"Hollywood recognizes no boundaries when it comes to making movies of literary ""classics."" This weekend they have dived back into the infinite pool of plots and bring their magic to the silver screen. Today's review is on Pride & Prejudice & Zombies, a spoof on the revered novel by Jane Austen. As ridiculous as it sounds, this tale of zombies invading 19th century England is an enjoyable tale that is clever, fun, and quite thrilling with a little imagination. But can the movie match the majesty of the novel, or does it fall flat on it's undead face? Here are my thoughts on the film. The story is very similar to the book, maintaining the clever integration of zombies with society and giving it that ridiculous twist. Our team managed to hit the high-points of the film and portrayed all of the major events that enthralled us in the novel. However they took some major creative liberties to spice the film up, effectively weaving a new story altogether. Fortunately all of the elements are designed around poking fun at the Victorian regality, all maintaining the underlying theme of Pride and Prejudice. Yet though they hit the key points, the editing of this film was rather poor in my opinion. Many scenes felt rushed, quickly stung together in a series that was logical but seemed to skip some details as they sloppily transitioned into another sequence. To me it seemed the editors had forgotten scenes and quickly pasted them somewhere that was deemed appropriate. Not the greatest move guys. Fortunately there was great cast that portrayed our characters and looked the part of royalty. Lily James (my favorite) dropped the glass slippers for boots and weapons as she brought a feistiness to the film. Her character was a nice balance of honor, pride, and skill as she brought a whole new definition of girl power to life. Sam Riley plays Mr. Darcy, and certainly has the roguish nature down pat, including a dazzling display of stage combat that would fit well in fantasy movies. However, he displays very flat emotion and was a bit boring for a main character. Jack Huston on the other hand captured the part of the villain perfectly, capturing all the shadiness, deceit, and ire necessary for a good antagonist to have. Other characters, including the zombie extras played their parts well, but many of them were underutilized, which although matched the book, was disappointing to see. Many characters were underdeveloped and the poor editing didn't help matters, as characters became lost in the background or plot holes this story had. Despite the limitations to their cast though, the design, costume, and makeup teams were on point in this movie. The setting itself was beautiful, the movie filled with rich, elaborate manors littered with English history. Various shots of the countryside and fields of the estate only further brought me into the world, making me feel as if I had stepped back in time to thisalternate reality. Costumes further brought the mood to life with elaborate dresses that were fitting of the times, but laced with a cool edge that many heroes are associated with. And for those who appreciate the more physical qualities, many costumes showed off our characters' figures quite well and that's all I'm saying. And of course props to the makeup department for once more proving Hollywood have the art of making people undead to a science. Grotesque visages superimposed with natural skin never ceases to amaze me, and this film continues to show just how important makeup artists are to bringing the horror of zombies to life. All of this aside though, the thing that truly roped me into seeing this film was the potential for action. Unfortunately I was disappointed once more. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has little of the adrenaline pumping moments I had expected. A few fights are impressive, but were short lived to mere seconds before abruptly ending. Despite the foreshadowing and story buildup, many of the action sequences are reduced to quick bouts of a character violently stabbing and stomping the victim into a squish, pulpy form (much of which is censored). And to be honest, I was quite bored in this movie, reduced to eating popcorn to stay awake at the many dull moments. So I warn those looking for a thrill to avoid this movie, unless your definition of thrill is rich Victorian dialogue geared at love. Although Lily James leads the cast in this comical twist to literary classics, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies fell short for me. The story was dull, and the editing robbed much of the suspense and quality I had expected from the trailers. Throw in the lackluster action and well there isn't much I can say to recommend it for the theater. Therefore skip this film and wait for Netflix unless you are just ""dying"" to see it. Cheesy puns aside my scores for this movie are:Action/Horror/Romance: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
43,mhorg2018,Booorrriinnnggg.,3,17 April 2016,"First, I didn't care for the book. It was a pastiche of the worst kind. Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave. Second, I found this a waste of a good cast. The story is somewhat disjointed, bouncing around and the zombies, while they are a bit original, aren't that frightening. Perhaps it's because they talk and run at times, something I hate in the zombie genre. The story is the main problem. Rather than a good linear tale, it bounces around a bit. And the entire bit of zombies finding god? Are they really zombies then? There is an interesting idea about brains that I won't give away, but over all this just couldn't hold my attention. Meanders a bit too much and a bit too dull in parts.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
44,bkrauser-81-311064,Brains! Where are the Brains!,1,8 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies marks a continuation of the on- screen joke started by Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). A joke that requires no punchline, nor wit nor effort, just a setup that coaxes you to laugh via hastily formed, idiotic, willfully infantile mad-lib. See I can do it too: Mansfield Park and Werewolves, Jane Eyre and the Golem, Lady Chatterley's Brood of Spider-Babies it's all part of the clever art of mashing things together like a toddler banging Legos with their off-brand counterparts. I encountered the quixotically titled book some years ago and reacted to the trailer much in the same way I did then; a brief moment of mirth followed by an eye-roll and a quick step to the left.Elizabeth Bennet (James) lives on her father's illustrious estate with her four sisters and her mother (Phillips) whom aristocracy is still a big deal regardless of apocalypse. Her sister Jane (Heathcote) is smitten for the young Mr. Bingley (Booth) who has a considerable estate. Meanwhile Bingley's friend, the drab, rich and prideful Mr. Darcy (Riley) becomes enamored with Elizabeth but Elizabeth refuses to acquiesce given that Darcy questions the motivations of the Bennets to see their daughters climb that stringent British social ladder. There's also zombies; the blood- thirsty kind that amble around in search of human brains. They have taken over all of Britain save London and the wooded area known as the In-Between.The original Jane Austen novel for which this entirely disposable piece of garbage is based on, intertwines its themes with cleverness and remarkable universality. Is it any wonder that two centuries after its release it is still among the most popular British novels of all time? The novel speaks of wealth, marriage and a sense of self within an imposing class structure. This movie expressly ignores such themes to shovel lazy fighting choreography in the audience's faces. There is some talk about lower aristocrats training in kung fu while higher classes training in Japanese swordsmanship but after a brief example of Elizabeth speaking Mandarin, the entire idea pretty much disappears amid the damp cellars and drawing room rumbles.But ""so what,"" I hear the rabble cry. It's a zombie movie not an English examination of the lives of landed gentry. How right you are, it is a zombie movie; a PG-13 zombie movie that neither delves into the psychological horror of a zombie apocalypse nor allows its audience the joy of submitting to lewd sensationalism. Its gore is tame, its gallows humor is rueful, its sense of dread, apparent yet constantly undercut by the supposed romance. The satirical possibilities embedded in the genre since George A. Romero are completely absent which is a shame because in my mind it is the only reason something this absurd would exist in the first place. Think about it; nobility and aristocracy constantly squabbling about the economics of marrying for class and stature, meanwhile literally an entire country of mindless, bestial hordes try desperately to take away their titles (and lives).Yeah, nope there's nothing purposefully, subliminally, or even accidentally clever about this movie. Not even its endearing economy remains unscathed though I credit the gaffer for keeping the sets dimmed to cover up their shoddiness. By the third act, continuity is completely jettisoned though it's obvious director Burr Steers was much more interested in maximizing style over telling a story competently.There are moments of attempted humor that go beyond the title, and the protagonists trying oh so hard to play the scene straight. Unfortunately those precious few moments resemble Mr. Collins's (Smith) character; dim, irritating and earnestly overdone. In one scene Mr. Bingley throws a prototypical round bomb at a gaggle of zombies right before a hand reaches for his ascot. He struggles to break free before the bomb explodes in a sequence that would have made Wile E. Coyote proud. That was literally the only moment I laughed; a moment so puerile I felt my I.Q. lowering to the number of my shoe size. See the reality is in the morose, unconscionably stuffy, painfully contrived world created by PPZ there is no need for pride or prejudice; there is only room for stupidity.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
45,quincytheodore,"The clash of tone is admittedly peculiar, yet the cast manages to sneak in healthy chunks of humor and drama amidst the impending zombie apocalypse.",7,14 February 2016,"Zombie infestation is spreading uncontrollably fast, they are literally everywhere, even in spin-off of Pride and Prejudice. It may sound bizarre at first, and it really is, but there's no lack of production value here. The presentation is top notch and the cast, mixed of actors from Maleficent, Cinderella, Doctor Who and Game of Thrones, deliver an air of seriousness beyond that expected from a zombie movie, also with unexpected degree of humor as well.This is still the story of British aristocrats and their so troubled lives in 19th century, though some aspects have been altered to accommodate zombies, even as far as to present backstory with heavy monologue and narration. It doesn't deter the movie from going full drama as the cast essentially creates a drama while acting like zombie killing is as the norm as sipping afternoon tea. These fine men and ladies look astoundingly fitting in the outlandishly bleak universe.Lily James, if born into different time, might be a legitimate princess. She looks comfortably convincing as Elizabeth Bennet, the zombie hunter version of the female lead at least. Sam Riley as Darcy is proper as well, he encompasses the awkward nobility with a fervent passion. These two have strange chemistry, especially when zombies are involved, yet it's weirdly adorably amicable. Matt Smith from Doctor Who fame, can singlehandedly delivers the humor, he's simply too versatile and endearing not to have in old style England.The humor works splendidly, there are times when sarcasm is produced just right against the backdrop of the somber tone. Its playful romance, bantering and even cringe worthy moments are pleasantly delightful. However, the jarring tone can be too distracting at times. The movie screams too hard to set grim horror, a staple flaw in horror genre and on the other side of spectrum, it's occasionally overly zealous in the drama that it becomes wallowing or slow.An odd bite of contrasting drama and comedy, yet surprisingly enjoyable, this seemingly crazy version of Pride and Prejudice can serendipitously attract audience of many different tastes.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

47,pyrocitor,"Brains, braaaaiiiiiins, and tons of fun",8,29 January 2016,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that no one really expected Pride and Prejudice and Zombies to be much good. Silly, campy fun, assuredly, but no more than an amusing trifle to mindlessly while away the passing moments. Well, anyone even fleetingly familiar with the works of Ms. Austen would know that to judge a book by its cover is exceedingly naughty, while anyone with passing knowledge of the zombie film would know that a surprising amount are replete with brains in more ways than one. Thus, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies haughtily thrusts its chin in the direction of naysayers, by boldly delivering all the silliness its title proclaims - only with the distinctly Mr. Darcy-like twist of bringing some of the best of its composite parts rather than what first impressions might suggest.For a film seemingly more akin to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, from the director of two consecutive pieces of Zac Efron fluff,P&P&Z from its opening moments onward, for a film so intentionally campy and stupid, is surprisingly sharp and on-point. Rather than pumping the contrast between its two warring influences strictly for laughs, writer/director Burr Steers is astute enough to realize the laughs need not be forced, but come far more unreservedly by committing to the premise as sincerely as possible. If anything, the film's biggest gag is being more satisfying as an Austen adaptation than zombie flick, as there's nitpicking to be had with the film's P3-13 violence (although Steers gets as gleefully gory as he can within ratings parameters), and running/talking zombies alike. Still, the twinkling aristocratic wit of Austenian England and the weary gallows humour of an apocalyptic action flick blend surprisingly well into one another, and Steers' adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's loving riff taps into the meat of the story, allowing the slog of a zombie war to tease out and accentuate the key elements of Austen's satire and characterizations alike (and let's face it: social faux-pas are just so much more satisfying when underscored with cathartic flip-kicks and decapitations). The novel's most beloved moments (including a slick lampooning of the infamous 'Mr. Darcy white shirt' scene) and key lines are often paired with plucky physical sparring, amidst perfectly timed bloodbaths just when proceedings start to stray more into Pride and Prejudice than Zombies.But Steers doesn't stop there, germinating some surprisingly interesting subtext - subtle aristocratic class distinctions are determined by whether citizens receive their anti-zombie martial arts training in Japan or China, while a sliding scale of zombie sentience allows for a realm of gentrified xenophobia relatively untapped in the genre. It's a bit of a shame that such a genuinely excellent setup slides into somewhat of a disappointingly mundane finish, replete with muddy, abandoned 'Horsemen of the Apocalypse' mythology, and several subplots jumbling together in a messy and unsatisfying resolution. To see the dual climaxes of the novel's swooniness and the make-or-break mass showdown of the zombie war verge on face-planting rather than soaring is a bummer indeed. Still, Steers maintains such a confidently jaunty touch throughout, letting the ball dances lilt and the fight scenes crackle (including at least two unexpected, thunderously loud head shots which serve as riotous punchlines), that the film is almost never less than fabulously vibrant and more fun than it has any right to be.Faced with retooling one of the most iconic protagonists in literary history, Lily James' Lizzie Bennett is commendably feisty and badass enough to firmly sate fans of either genre. Though Austen-diehards might fault her controversial slight teariness (you try having to constantly fend off the undead amidst the claustrophobic constraints of polite society and not feeling a little weepy sometimes), James' steely but playful charisma makes her an ideal, genre-straddling lead. Similarly (though his 70-year-old rasp takes some acclimatizing to), Sam Riley's mournful eyes and steadfast chin lend innate depth to the enigmatically brooding Mr. Darcy, and the commanding Riley swelters and sword fights like the best of them. Jack Huston perfectly blends the debonair affability and sinister unsavoury attributes of Mr. Wickham with a passionately invested energy, while Bella Heathcote and Douglas Booth are each adorably earnest as the tale's 'other' star-crossed lovers, and Charles Dance and Sally Phillips are deliciously slyly witty and boorishly superficial as Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. Still, the film may as well have been rebranded ""The Matt Smith Show,"" as the former Doctor is nothing short of perennially hysterical as the prissy Mr. Collins, his every utterance, every facial expression, every snobbishly prancing step a scene-stealing, belly-laugh-erupting delight, in one of the most consistently pristine comedic performances seen in years.Taking the p*ss out of historical romance and lending substance to axe-in-face escapism, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies blends the pleasures of its twain influences to a surprisingly satisfying degree. It's easily the most charming rom-zom-com since Shaun of the Dead (though, to be fair, the competition leaves something to be desired...) while a deceptively hearty Austen revamp to boot, and hugely enjoyable for audiences endeared to one, the other, or both. In fact, with such good fortune at hand, we're really only in want of one thing: bring on Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, please.-7.5/10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

49,RforFilm,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies never finds a middle ground to this combination and is brought down by a tame PG-13 tone,3,8 February 2016,"The idea of combining classic stories with monsters isn't a bad idea. In a way, it's almost like a fan fiction that ended up becoming popular enough to get it's own book release. Some random ideas I'd like to throw out there include The Abominable Romeo + Juliet Yetis, The Grapes of Wrath and Cannibals, and even I Love Lucy and her Mummies. A lot of the success depends on either how seriously the situation is taken or how funny the scenario is. The one that I know that the most attention is the Seth Grahame-Smith novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (which was adapted into a movie back in 2012.What's interesting was that the movie of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter came out at the same time when vampires were all the rage (no thanks to that Twilight series). Now zombies are ""the in- monster"" with The Walking Dead show still clocking in high ranking ratings. The problem now is that I've seen a tone of copycat zombie stories that are all about the same theme of survival. While not a bad thing, it's popularity is going to eventually die out too unless something new is brought to the table. Here we get the newest horror/classic story mash, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.After a very fascinating opening that explains an alternative universe where a zombie outbreak is going in England, we find aristocratic Elizabeth Bennet (played by Lilly James) and her five sisters are warriors that are trained in Chinese hand-to-hand combat to fight the zombies (which has become common in this world, though the wealthiest train in Japanese arts while China is the lower tier). Her father wants them to be prepared for zombies all the time while their mother Mrs. Bennet would prefer to see her daughters married off in order to give them a chance at a normal life.The young women attend a local ball where Elizabeth is taken notice of expert Zombie hunter Mr. Darcy (played by Sam Riley), but is turned off by his comments on how she's unappealing to him. Elizabeth also meets a charming and polite solider, Mr. George Wickham (played by Jack Huston) who fancies her, but has some sort of history with Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth constantly considers who the better man is for her as the zombies start to overtake the city of London, threatening the extinction of humans.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has great idea and an apparently successful book to make it a hit movie, but after seeing it, I don't get it. The story that I thought that I was going to get was going to be a lot funnier and a lot darker, full of well, good zombie action. It seems that director Burr Steers is more interested in telling the story of Pride and Prejudice rather then the zombie element as I found the majority of the romance incredibly boring. I'm sure that the Jane Austin story is a good one, but the performances feel too stale to create an engaging world of wealth.Getting to the zombies, aside from constantly talking a lot about them, there not a lot of them until the climax battle in London. I kept thinking that Edger Wright or Sam Rami would have gone for a hard R rating with a lot of splatter gore, but the all too safe PG-13 insultingly eliminates what most zombie fans love; the violence. Even the zombies themselves are not the creative and rely too much on CGI to make them up. If anything, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies feels like a movie that's four years behind on what people really want.I'll give this three Pride and Prejudice and Zombies books out of ten. Aside from feeling so pandering to teenage zombie fans, it's a combination of ideas that never finds a middle ground. Unless if you read the book and want to compare, I'd say skip this and read the Jane Austin story on Saturday and to watch The Walking Dead on Sunday. This is barely worth a cup of tea let alone a movie ticket.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
50,petra_ste,A mediocre hybrid which will please very few,5,25 June 2016,"I like zombie movies; I like Jane Austen novels. This doesn't mean I like them together - I also like both pizza and snorkeling, but I suspect trying them at the same time would be a less than satisfactory experience.I am not as offended by this mash-up as many apparently are. Yes, it's a weaselly way to use someone else's (classic) work for money - but, when a book still inspires parodies and pastiches two hundred years later, it means it's still vital and relevant.So, Jane Austen and zombies. Set in an alternate history England overrun by a zombie plague, the movie follow spirited, katana-wielding Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and proud zombie hunter Darcy (Sam Riley) as they meet, clash and fall in love while trying to survive the undead horde. This could have been charmingly stupid, but it required a person of great talent at the helm to make the charming prevail over the stupid - say, Shaun of the Dead's Edgar Wright, a man able to milk every single opportunity for off-beat humour and to get a laugh even from the way he frames someone being offered a slice of cake. Director Burr Steers doesn't bring anything special to the table; set-pieces aren't exciting, horror isn't scary, humor isn't funny. The result is a badly stitched up Frankenstein monster barely limping through its 107 minutes.Even social satire, a promising angle (think of the clash between formal, stuffy upper-class 18th century Britain and a zombie epidemic) is mostly overlooked.Maybe producers expected this would be a perfect date movie, with romance for girls, zombies for boys and comedy for both - judging from its box office results, general audiences didn't take the bait. I guess we may be spared the likes of Wuthering Heights and Werewolves, War and Peace and Aliens, Great Expectations and the Mummy.5/10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
51,Anurag-Shetty,A wacky take on the classic novel.,8,23 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is based on the Quirk Books novel of the same name, by Jane Austen & Seth Grahame-Smith. England in the 1800s, has been overrun by zombies. Mr. Bennet(Charles Dance) & Mrs. Bennet(Sally Phillips) have five daughters namely, Elizabeth Bennet(Lily James), Jane Bennet(Bella Heathcoate), Lydia Bennet(Ellie Bamber), Mary Bennet(Millie Brady) & Kitty Bennet(Suki Waterhouse). Elizabeth & her sisters have been intensely trained in the main form of martial arts & combat training, to thwart the zombie menace. However, Mrs. Bennet insists that the girls should lay down their array of weapons to kick some zombie butt & get married to the most eligible bachelor in town, as soon as possible. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a highly entertaining film. Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice novel, has been adapted to celluloid, countless number of times. However, Seth Grahame-Smith's decision to add zombies in his Quirk Books version of Jane Austen's classic is gutsy & works wonders for this movie. Burr Steers' screenplay of the novel & his skillful direction, makes sure that this adaptation of the tale of the Bennet sisters, Mr. Darcy(Sam Riley), Mr. Bingley(Douglas Booth) & George Wickham(Jack Huston), feels like a brand new adventure. There is plenty of zombie slaying set pieces. Lizzie & her sisters have never been more bad-ass & attractive. Don't worry, all of you romantics. The spirit of Jane Austen's bestseller has been retained & you do root for all your favorite characters. The viewer really hopes that their story ends, the same way as it does in the original novel. The brand new character of Lady Catherine de Bourgh(Lena Headey) is a welcome addition to the already established characters. Considering how ridiculous the concept of a zombie virus outbreak in Victorian England is, there could have been much more witty dialogs & hilarious scenes in the film. Also, there is not as much zombie dismembering as I would have liked. Lily James is outstanding as Elizabeth Bennet. James' fierce Lizzie, is a far cry from her goody two shoes character of Cinderella, in the film of the same name. Sam Riley is great as Mr. Darcy. Bella Heathcoate is amazing as Jane Bennet. Douglas Booth is great as Mr. Bingley. Jack Huston is superb as George Wickham. Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady & Suki Waterhouse are impressive as Lydia Bennet, Mary Bennet & Kitty Bennet, respectively. Sally Phillips & Charles Dance are effective as Mrs. Bennet & Mr. Bennet, respectively. Lena Headey is awesome as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Matt Smith is hysterical as Parson Collins. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is not a must watch in theaters. However, go for it if you have some time to kill or, watch it on TV.

53,dave-mcclain,Pride + Prejudice + Zombies = a great time at the movies,9,8 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice AND ZOMBIES?? It sounds strange. It is. It sounds like a bad B-movie, but is it? ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" (PG-13, 1:48) has a very unusual premise but not a unique one. If you're tempted to dismiss this movie as disrespectful to classic literature, or history (or zombies), I'd encourage you to consider the following two movies: In 2005, Indian and British filmmakers got together to produce a Bollywood-style film called ""Bride & Prejudice"". It was loosely based on ""Pride and Prejudice"", Jane Austen's classic 1813 novel about conflicts and misunderstandings among young men and women of different social standing. In 2012, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" created an alternate history by merging the personal background of the man who would become the 16th President of the United States with legends and fictional characteristics of the so-called ""children of the night"".Worldwide, ""Vampire Hunter"" earned double what it had cost to produce. Box office receipts for ""Bride & Prejudice"" tripled that movie's budget. And then there are other alternate versions of history, such as 2009's ""Inglourious Basterds"", which doubled the money spent on its production, and fictionalized versions of history like 2003's ""The Last Samurai"" whose worldwide take was three times its budget.What's more, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" was co-written by Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the book on which that movie is based – and had previously written the 2009 mash-up novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"", the book on which the 2016 movie is based. So, if movies like this aren't unheard-of, and they make money, the most important question that remains is whether ""Pride + Prejudice + Zombies"" (as it's also written) is in the same class as the other films mentioned above.Much like the characters in Jane Austen's original work, in this film, there's a wealthy Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) whose pride is misinterpreted as arrogance by Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James), an independent young woman who tends to let first impressions and unproven stories prejudice her attitudes towards others. Darcy and Elizabeth clash at first, but eventually feel drawn to each other. UN-like Jane Austen's story, this is all happening as Darcy and Elizabeth are trying to fend off the zombie apocalypse.In this film's version of history, Great Britain has become afflicted with a plague brought to its shores from its overseas empire. London has been walled off by the Grand Barrier and is further protected by the Royal Moat, a giant trench which encircles the city as well as an area of farm land known as the In-Between. Britain's undead roam the countryside in fairly small numbers, but are a persistent concern to the country's landowners and there's something different about these zombies. They're not as fast as the flesh and brain eaters in ""World War Z"", but they are more intelligent than those in TV's ""The Walking Dead"". And there are rumors that the apocalypse described in the Bible's Book of Revelations will be a zombie apocalypse, complete with the biblical Four Horsemen and led by the Anti-Christ.For the sake of self-preservation, British families who can afford it send their children (male and female alike) to Japan or China in order to receive training in martial arts and various kinds of weaponry. Elizabeth and her four sisters are especially skilled warriors who are encouraged in their training by their father (Charles Dance). On the other hand, their mother (Sally Phillips) is more focused on marrying off all five of them as quickly as possible – so they can be protected and supported. At a nearby ball, an eligible bachelor named Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) sets his eyes on Elizabeth's older sister, Jane (Bella Heathcote). Soon afterward, Elizabeth is being pursued by the awkward and obnoxious Parson Collins (Matt Smith). She has no interest in the Parson, or in the growing affections of Mr. Darcy, especially after what she hears about him from a British soldier named Wickham (Jack Huston), a man from Darcy's past. The relationships just get more complicated and more challenging as the story progresses. This is, after all, a period romance and an ongoing struggle to avoid getting eaten by zombies.""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is tough to describe and do it justice. It's strange, but not too weird. It's a B-movie premise that does not play like a B-movie. Production values are high, the acting is strong and Burr Steers' writing and directing tell a well-constructed stylized story. And the movie smartly avoids extremes. The zombie killings are not overly gory and the romance isn't too sappy. The various elements of Austen's tale and the book's zombie story work together remarkably well – better than most Movie Fans would probably expect. In short, Pride + Prejudice + Zombies = a great time at the movies. ""A""",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
54,swilliky,Zombies and fighters were cool but a boring story!,4,7 February 2016,"I've not read Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen or the updated version with zombies added by Seth Grahame-Smith but was able to catch the movie this weekend. Though the mix of romance and zombies were intriguing, I found the movie slow and restrained to the plot of the Jan Austen novel. The acting was passable with Lily James in the lead as Elizabeth Bennett. Sam Riley is the romantic interest as Mr. Darcy. HIs voice sounded odd but the chemistry wasn't totally absent. The zombie action was entertaining and any zombies will bring me to the theater and earn a few stars. The story didn't fit very well but the special effects were enough to make up for it. There were some really sick looking zombies throughout the film, and I was glad to see some of them running. My expectations were low enough that I didn't come out of the movie totally disappointed but the story was pretty boring. The plot had a predictable twist that could be seen about halfway through the film. The movie couldn't seem to decide between a comedy, romance, action, or horror and settled somewhere in the middle. I do like that zombies are getting more mainstream movies and the badass women were fun to watch!Check out more reviews on swilliky.com",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
55,Dan1863Sickles,Enormously Funny And Surprisingly Touching,8,5 February 2016,"I know most people who love PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen are furious about this movie even existing, let alone being successful. But I actually liked it a lot!I know the original classic fairly well (I'm a former high school English teacher and a current college librarian) and I was astonished almost from the very beginning at how much of the dialogue comes direct from Jane Austen's novel. All of the issues that really matter and the conflicts that draw the reader into the novel are still very much alive in the movie. It's just that they are juxtaposed against the horror of the walking dead. I can't say enough about the good looking young (and not so young) cast members. I was absolutely blown away by how seriously Lily James and Sam Riley took the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Both of them are so skilled at projecting courage and integrity combined with deep feelings and hidden pain. They never seem silly even when they're doing very silly things, i.e. cutting each others' clothes to bits in a sword fight. Bella Heathcote and Douglas Booth as Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley are almost as good, and I have to say, visually they are absolutely perfect as the characters from Jane Austen's novel. And the supporting players are absolutely outstanding! You just cannot go wrong with Charles Dance as Mr. Bennett. His performance is exactly what you would hope for in a serious adaptation. Though that's true of every actor in the cast, really. Lena Headey is an exquisite Lady Catherine DeBurgh, though her character is ultimately just a little more sympathetic towards Elizabeth than she is in the novel. Even Jack Huston, who has been a hero of mine ever since his epic role as disfigured World War One veteran Richard Harrow in BOARDWALK EMPIRE, is an effective villain as Mr. Wickham. Best of all is Matt Smith, who takes the thankless role of the hateful Mr. Collins and turns it into an irresistible Peter Sellers style comic explosion. He's that good. Let's face it, a Jane Austen zombie movie is not for everyone. But if you're willing to be open minded and you enjoy great acting, comedy and romance, this just might be for you. The sword fights are exciting, the love scenes (including the arguments) are authentically romantic, and the blood and guts are never really that gross. Oh, and if you do go and see the movie, make sure to stay through the closing credits, because the last joke of the film is really the best!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
56,CANpatbuck3664,Hit a Goofy Sweet Spot For Me,8,1 July 2018,"I haven't read Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice and I've never had the urge to. I read Sense and Sensibility and it wasn't my cup of tea. So, I turned this on with the hope that having a more contemporary element would make a story that clearly wasn't written for me, easier to sit through. I'm happy to report that it did and a large part of that was the humour that they incorporated into the narrative. Maybe other people saw it differently, but it just made me smile to watch people in this elaborate gowns and debonair dress slicing and dicing the undead. They establish the mythology (which was tightly written enough to satisfy me) and while they follow the beats of the original story, the zombie fighting is squeezed in and it works better than I thought it would have. It wasn't perfect, but I thought it was a pleasant surprise.So, while this movie departs from the classic story, my problems with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies don't have anything to do with those changes. The most noticeable flaw with this project is the sub-par effects and makeup. The budget on this is relatively low at $28 million (which was good considering how few people saw this in theatres) and unfortunately it shows. The costuming is good but with so many competing zombie TV shows (The Walking Dead) and movies (Zombieland) doing zombies so much better, it makes P&P&Z look even worse by comparison. I was also disappointed that the ending fizzled out. This could be blamed on the source material, but I don't see how. There's a considerable buildup with the rivalry between Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) and George Wickham (Jack Huston) and the movie seems to be preparing you for a bad@$$ zombie fight. But there's almost nothing when the resolution hits and while I can appreciate a credit stinger that seems to set things up for a sequel, I wanted more.Through the positives and the negatives, the big thing that this movie brought to my attention was how talented Lily James is. I had seen her in supporting parts in Baby Driver, Darkest Hour and the Exception (Downtown Abbey isn't my thing) but she's the lead heroine here as Elizabeth Bennet and she knocks it out of the park. She anchors this movie capably and I don't know if this movie would have worked without her. She's turning into a performer that I would tune into a show or movie I didn't know about just because of her involvement. I largely liked the rest of the cast, but I also want to credit Matt Smith as the Bennet's wimpy cousin Parson Collins. I'm not familiar with him as an actor but he had me laughing in almost every scene he appeared in. This is a movie full of strong characters and Parson is conversely so pathetic that it becomes easy to mine laughs out of him being such a tool. I also enjoyed Bella Heathcote, Charles Dance, Jack Huston and Lena Headey in their supporting parts.I can understand die hard fans of Pride and Prejudice turning their nose up to this. But I'm not in that camp and this movie made the Pride and Prejudice story palatable for me. I liked the tongue-in-cheek humour, how they decided to work in the zombie elements in and the movie boasts a dynamic lead performance from Lily James. Is it a landmark in screenwriting? Absolutely not but I did enjoy this movie from beginning to end. My true rating for this would be a 7.5/10 but I'll round up to 8/10. I would recommend this to people looking for an interesting mashup of genres, but I would also warn you ahead of time, if you're a fan of the classic novel, this film probably will seem like blasphemy.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
57,SquigglyCrunch,Fun and Mostly Compelling,7,12 October 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a satire of the classic romance entitled 'Pride and Prejudice' and tells a similar story with some minor differences. It follows a group of daughters as their parents learn of a wealthy man coming to live in their town. Elizabeth Bennett, one of the daughters, develops a relationship with the wealthy man, but it isn't exactly friendly. Oh, and there's zombies that they have to deal with. The first twenty or so minutes of this movie set it up really well. It presents itself as a satire that won't take itself seriously, and you as the audience kind of get that vibe throughout. While it does get more serious after those first twenty minutes, it's mostly due to the shock value that this actually happened having deteriorated and the audience realizing what path the story is taking. That, and it does try to follow the original story of Pride and Prejudice, and it does a pretty great job actually (at least, in accordance to the 2005 movie). The story is actually pretty compelling and interesting, and made infinitely more fun than the original story. Something I really love about this movie is the title. It itself is a satire, in that this generation was, for a time, obsessed with zombies. Considering how blatantly goofy the title is, I'm quite sure that this was the intention of the author who originally wrote the book. Despite it's simplicity, it's pretty clever, and I think that's just a cool little thing that makes the movie just a tiny bit better.I really didn't expect this from a satirical fantasy romance about zombies, but there was some pretty good acting in this movie. In particular, Lily James is pretty great. I didn't care much for her in the 2015 live action remake of Cinderella, but she was pretty great here. She was great in all the action sequences, and the same in her dramatic scenes. Seriously, she's an actress I'll be looking out for in the near future. The action scenes are pretty great, actually. They're pretty fast- paced and fun, with good choreography to boot. My biggest problem with this movie, however, is that the satirical comedy doesn't last. Like I said, it sets itself up as a movie that won't take itself seriously and makes a few jokes along the way, but after that I stopped laughing right up until the ending. Overall Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a pretty good movie. It's relatively funny, compelling, well-acted, and fun, but it still lacks in it's humor. If you ask me it's one of the better early 2016 movies. In the end this was a pleasant surprise and I'd definitely recommend it.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
58,MattBrady099,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies - Movie Review,5,14 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice...or and there's Zombies in it as well.The story is about a zombie outbreak has fallen upon the land in Jane Austen's classic tale of the tangled relationships between lovers from different social classes in 19th century England.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is just as ridiculous as it sounds. Just the thought of taking a classic novel and adding whatever monsters you can put in. It's been done before in movies, TV shows and novels. Now we've got this movie and you would expect a film like this to be a fun, gory and just a good time, but sadly that's not the case here, because Pride and Prejudice and Zombies isn't that good or fun.The problem that I had with this movie is that I had no fun at all watching it and the film takes itself way too seriously. A couple of times it dose lose focus on what it's doing and at one point completely forgetting that it's a zombie movie. I know the ""Pride and Prejudice"" thing is in the title so it would be like that, but zombies are in the title as well.The movie has a lot of interesting ideas (mostly with the zombies), unfortunately those ideas gets brush aside and what we get is less of a zombie movie as it adverse. Yes the movie dose deliver on Pride and Prejudice, but not that much on zombies. Another thing that I was really disappointed with is the lackluster fight scenes, I mean it wasn't anything that special or exciting. Lena Headey and Charles Dance are in this movie and both of them don't do anything. It was a complete waste of their talents and time.There are good things in this movie such as: the make-up was pretty solid, the performances for the most part were good and it was well shot at times.Overall Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was a massive disappointment for me, because it had a chance of being great and enjoyable. As I said before, it had a lot of things going for it with the cast, the director and the fresh ideas for the zombies. This is another movie that couldn't live up to it's title.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
59,funtasticfour,Better than your average zombie movie,7,16 July 2018,"Once upon a time, I enjoyed zombies, but then they seemed to be everywhere, and I needed a break. Having never watched Pride and Prejudice, I liked the idea of zombies infecting this era. The costumes are great, and the effects are ok. I like that the zombies are kind of smart, so thats a nice twist. The girls all do some great butt kicking, and the story isn't too bad, what I'm assuming is stolen from the original material.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
60,ethanbresnett,A real missed opportunity with this film,6,1 April 2021,"The idea of this film really appealed to me. I love period films and I love zombie films, what's not to love? This seemingly ideal blending of genres could have fantastic but unfortunately it failed to deliver on several counts.There are plenty of positives with this film. Firstly the underlying concept is great and so enjoyable. Following some brief narrative exposition by Charles Dance we are right into the story. I liked the route that they went down in terms of the zombie set up. The plot was actually pretty decent too. I do feel like they could have done more from a story perspective considering the world that they created but it did the job and kept me entertained.Then there's the cast. Lily James is always great and knows how to sell a period role. Sally Phillips was great in a supporting role as was a scene stealing Lena Headey, but the real star of the show for me was Matt Smith. He was so funny in this film and it was at its best when he was on screen. His comedic timing and delivery was impeccable.The real let down of this film was the zombie action. They could have done so much more with this! They set up the Bennet sisters as a bunch of well trained and fierce women, but then really failed to utilise any of this. We were treated to a few set pieces, but they were few and far between and when they did come they were a little flat. I also felt like the film was building towards a big crescendo which never really arrived, making the final act a big let down.I also could not get on board with Sam Riley's portrayal of Mr Darcy. It just didn't work for me and considering his heavy involvement in proceedings this was far from ideal.Overall this film is decent and probably worth a watch if you like kooky/zombie films. I just think there was so much missed potential and this could have become a cult classic with a little more care put into it.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
61,ericrnolan,"""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" could have been an instant cult favorite. But it still falls short of greatness",7,5 March 2016,"""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" (2016) is a fun enough horror- comedy — maybe not quite as good as it could be, considering all of its excellent ingredients, yet still better than most new zombie movies out there. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.It's a great genre mashup, and I don't just mean combining Jane Austen's 1813 classic book with horror's most grisly sub-genre. (This is a film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's 2009 eponymous satire novel.) It's also a detailed and thoughtfully constructed horror-fantasy. (That opening credits' alternate-history lesson was a nice touch.) Then it tries, with less success, to be a serviceable romance and a mystery.The film has a lot going for it: a fun concept, good actors, mostly competent direction, and a creative team that obviously had a hell of a lot of fun with the source material. Science fiction fans should have fun spotting Matt Smith, Lena Headey and Charles Dance. The movie has outstanding sets, costumes and filming locations — this was shot on location at historic mansions throughout England. The fight choreography was decent enough, even if it was occasionally a little hard to follow. Finally, the zombies that we get to see are indeed creepy — they're not Romero-type zombies, but the livelier, chattier, brain-eating, sentient baddies similar to those of John Russo's ""Return of the Living Dead"" films. The makeup and digital effects for the monsters are pretty damn good.Considering its unique idea, its zaniness and its high production values, ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" could have been an instant cult favorite. But it still falls short of greatness with two flaws that I couldn't ignore.The first is its seeming reliance on a single joke — the juxtaposition of Austen's proper ladies as badass, feminist heroines in a crazy, Kung-fu, bloody-and-guts zombie war. I believe that's funny and tickles the viewer for maybe 20 minutes. But it isn't enough to sustain the humor for the length of a feature film. It's fun, but badass, wise-cracking warrior women have been a common trope in mainstream horror film and television for a long time. Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" came to TV 19 years ago, for example; the film that inspired it was five years earlier.Second, for a film with ""zombies"" in its title, the monsters are a little sparse. I'm guessing the script closely followed the 2009 book, which I have not read  but this isn't the actioner that horror fans might be hoping for. (And why not? The film falls under so many other categories.) The movie could have been better if there had been less banter and situational humor, and more zombie fighting. Its establishing shots and sweeping vistas were downright beautiful  I kept waiting for a major land engagement that would knock my socks off. But  there isn't really a final battle, and the story disappoints a little with its anti-climax. The action sequence that we are presented with is cool, and well executed, but the large-scale period battles you're probably hoping for occur almost entirely off screen.Oh — one final quibble  who exactly were the Four Horsemen, outside their allegorical context? And what happened to them? They were nice and unsettling — one of the movie's few scary moments occurs when we wonder whether they've spotted a protagonist. Were scenes cut from this movie that would have explained their role in the story?",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

63,HelenMary,Jane Austen plus Zombies,6,19 February 2017,"I love P&P and had seen this book (P&P&Z) on the best seller lists but had no idea how it would translate from classic period drama to fantasy schlock-fest period drama. Turns out, quite easily and without much adjustment to the plot. Also, it was very entertaining to watch.It stuck closely to Jane Austen's classic original, keeping all the classic lines and characters; The Bennett family and Mr Collins, Lady Catherine de Burgh and of course Darcy and Mr Bingley. The difference being that there was a 1700s zombie uprising and girls of good character and accomplishment didn't just learn to read, sing, dance and play the pianoforte, sew and carry themselves with refinement and good deportment, they also had to be martial artists trained in either the Japanese or Chinese (depending on social standing) arts of zombie killing.Miss Jane Bennett (Bella Heathcote) isn't the beauty of previous P&P incarnations, and doesn't have the strong but quiet character as the eldest Miss Bennett, and seems younger and more like her mother, but Elizabeth Bennett (Lily James) the second sister, steals the show on every front. She really does have the most amazing eyes, and everyone would consider her a beauty. The three younger Bennett girls are seen and heard giggling but for the most part aren't in the scene except Lydia's unfortunate elopement. Mr and Mrs Bennett are played stoic and sensible, and flighty and silly respectively, and well, by Charles Dance and Sally Phillips. Darcy and Bingley Sam Riley (On the Road) and Douglas Booth are both great, my only complaint with Mr Bingley would be that he was far too pretty, to be historically correct – but then we're throwing caution to the wind with zombies so never mind. Matt Smith (Ex Dr) played the hapless and silly Mr – pardon, Parson – Collins well, and was suitably ridiculous, but a little too easy on the eye to be as odious and unappealing as he is meant to be – a problem with this production being everyone was younger and more attractive than they should be. Lady Catherine was the gorgeous Lena Heady for crying out loud! Generally the story kept to loose plot – Eliza being snubbed by Darcy at the ball and Jane's immediate attachment with Bingley Collins coming to choose a Bennett girl, Jane visiting Netherfield and catching cold, the balls, Darcy and Bingley's return to London, Mr Wickham's (Jack Huston) ingratiation with the Bennetts and all the subsequent toing and froing of affections. Jack Huston actually stood out as a good actor in this, but didn't have the slimy countenance of classic Wickhams. Then, there are the additions of zombies. All the way through the film we have opportunity for the Bennett girls (and I wondered where the other girls in Meriton were hiding) to show off their knife and musket skills with much showing of stocking and garter in the process, and heaving bosom. Fighting in corsets – whatever next? The fight scenes are good, though John Wick they are not, and you can see that most of the gore and action is actually off screen; blades are always clean (!) and lots of the hits on zombie actors are visibly wide of mark. It's not a particularly gory film, if at all, but the SFX of the faces of the zombies are very good and in places, very gross. This is not for young children.Enjoyable, funny and heavily recognisable as the classic, so entertaining from that point of view – the comparison – but lacking in emotion. I found I didn't really care for any of the characters, the ""twists"" were telegraphed a mile away, and I didn't find myself investing. It is a shallow visual immersion, although well-acted and sets, locations and costumes were done as if trying to be a big Hollywood film, but I just couldn't really care. I laughed, yes, but it was the comparison to the original that brought me most enjoyment (and that didn't have zombies in it – spoiler alert!) or homages to previous P&P films/TV shows – the Darcy swimming in the lake for example. Great Saturday evening watching, fun version for teens pre-GCSE to watch as ""study"" but not something I'd rave about or rush out to buy, although I would say it's definitely worth seeing.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
64,eberkerbatur,interesting and bad interpretation of a great work (3.5),3,21 May 2020,"Never disliked it could be the worst movie I ever watched.
They have handled a great work in a different style, and it was awful, so it would be better if the zombies invaded it in the old English period. I do not understand why they have unnecessarily included pride and prejudice.
I still have not understood what it has to do. I am frankly against the changing of such magnificent works that this movie already sucks as seen.It's not a movie, it was like a video clip, it's not catchy, I feel like I haven't watched a movie at all.

65,kermitkid,Fun crossover parody,9,30 March 2020,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. When you read the title ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" you think ""how silly."" I was expecting this to be ""meh"" at best and downright awful at worst. I was wrong. Having been forced to read the ""Pride and Prejudice"" book in high school, I'm glad they finally made a version where I could understand what was going on and didn't bore me to death. It's the same classic story, but with zombie attacks thrown in. And as bizarre as that sounds and as different as these genres are, they synergize really well. The zombie elements affect the original plot and vice versa. I do have one complaint and that is Matt Smith's performance. As much as I love Matt Smith on ""Doctor Who"", that's just the problem. Whenever he's on screen I feel like I'm watching ""Doctor Who."" He is the comedic relief and he is really good at it but it feels like watching an exact copy of the 11th Doctor, right down to the personality. The zombie elements work really well. The action is over-the-top, without being too over-the-top, and while some parts of the movie look fake at times (blood), it actually works in the movie's favor because it emphasizes that it's supposed to be silly. It's just a parody of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and is in no way supposed to be taken seriously.

66,Rendanlovell,Extraordinarily bland.,3,6 February 2016,"If there is one thing that has become incredibly apparent in our culture today it's that we love mythical creatures. But zombies have somehow eked their way into every facet of our lives. Video games, books, movies, and now cross overs with other popular works. This isn't a bad thing though. If we didn't all love it this wouldn't be happening right now. Unfortunately 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' may have proved that these pop culture icons may be coming to their final demise, at least for mainstream movies. Don't get me wrong this movie is really bad, but it isn't the worst thing to ever happen to me so lets talk about its strengths. One of the few saving graces here is Matt Smith. He may not have the greatest performance ever but he is the only person in this entire movie with a personality. Every other actor seems to be bored ninety percent of the time. So each time he is on screen he basically steals the show.Another positive is the opening half hour or so. We learn about what 18th century London may have been like if it was deep in the middle of a zombie infestation. Then we get to see our main actors show off their zombie hunting skills in some pretty alright fight sequences. But this blistering pace and excessive zombie violence doesn't last long.As I said, only for about thirty minutes. After that point we get the basic Pride and Prejudice love triangle coupled with stiff dialogue. The remaining hour plus is filled with uncomfortably bland characters spewing uncomfortably lifeless dialogue. And, sadly enough, this is the best part of the remaining two acts.The fact that zombies were included is the worst part. By doing this the film promises fans that this won't be the typical love triangle that they are used to. No, this time flesh eating creatures will be having at them. But the way that they are presented makes next to no sense. Some are super smart, sneaky zombies that can hide and jump out right as the film needs them to.Others are incredibly stupid and let characters literally walk past them. They never impose a threat because the film never allows them too. It only uses them as badly timed plot devices. It throws them in whenever things start to get overly stale, to try and lighten the mood. But, by doing this, things are only made worse.Poorly used zombies can sometimes be overlooked, but stupid characters can't be. Watching a ""highly trained"" character take off into a zombie infested forest at night is just one of these instances. In fact there are so many things just like this that listing each one would probably take an entire page to write down. And with each one the film grows more and more unbelievable and boring.'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' may offer an interesting cross over type movie but it doesn't actually do anything with this offer. It promises so much that it can't deliver. The characters are incredibly flat, the zombies mechanics make next to no sense, characters act insanely dumb, and uneven pacing only heightens this bland experience.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
67,themadmovieman,Insanely entertaining,8,11 February 2016,"Two things I've never really cared for: the novels of Jane Austen, and zombie movies. Yet when put together, you get an insane parody full of laughs and drama that is Pride And Prejudice And Zombies. Hilarious at almost every moment, and featuring brilliant action and a heap of excellent performances, I absolutely loved this movie, no matter how silly that might seem.The premise alone is brilliant. Based on a 2009 novel, the story isn't just a zombie movie set in 19th Century England, but instead a retelling of Pride And Prejudice, where there just happen to be zombies all around. Therefore, you're thrown right into the deep end and don't have to wait for the generic impending zombie invasion for some action, because this film really starts with a bang.The first scene perfectly embodies everything that I loved about this movie. On the one hand, it feels immediately like a period piece. The costumes and production design is wonderful, and all the characters speak as if this were just Pride And Prejudice. But on the other hand, this is a brilliantly silly and excessively violent zombie parody, throwing in unexpected jump scares and spurting blood right from the start, setting up the brilliantly hilarious tone within seconds.And then, for the following 70 or so minutes, I couldn't stop loving this movie. Managing to maintain a consistent tone that balances the fun zombie parody with the Pride And Prejudice parody so well, telling both an action story and a romance story in the most entertaining way, with really well-written dialogue and fantastically well-directed action sequences too, and that left me with a huge grin that I just couldn't wipe off my face.What's more is that the performances are all fantastic too. Normally, good acting isn't the sort of thing you'd expect in a zombie movie, or a parody for that matter, but everyone is right at the top of their game here. Lily James is excellent in the main role, and shows how good she can be in both a serious romantic lead (because there are a lot of moments where the romance does take centre stage here), and as a great action hero, making her huge fun to watch right the way through.Also, Matt Smith, Sally Phillips, Douglas Booth and even Lena Headey were brilliant, but my favourite performance of the entire movie has to be Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy. Firstly, the way the character is written here is hilarious, turning the charming gentleman into a battle-hardened colonel, but the way Riley cements that personality with his piercing stare and gruff voice is brilliant too, and was one of the things that really kept me laughing again and again here.Of course, it couldn't last forever, and I do take issue with the final act of this movie. Although it's not bad, it unfortunately undoes a lot of the good work done earlier in setting up the brilliant tone. In the final twenty minutes, there's still some good action, but I just didn't have enough fun, as the film began to turn too much into both a zombie movie, and then a simple Pride And Prejudice retelling.It was a shame to see the final act disappoint, but even so, I had a huge amount of fun with Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, thanks to its generally fantastic tone, great action, brilliant humour and excellent performances.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
68,srdjan_veljkovic,Interesting idea followed through to moderate success and some laughs,6,6 December 2017,"Putting the somewhat silly and naive P&P into zombie-land seems even more silly. But, they do follow through on this premise until the end. It kind of works. Story is somewhat ""watered-down"", but, it's still there. And there are zombies! :)There are some good jokes in there, which actually makes this pass the bar of acceptable. Without it, this whole exercise would have seemed rather pointless.I believe it would have been better if they explored more the very silly notion that zombies are so popular in this age and made more fun of the genre.The feminist element is not too much. Sure, it's silly that 5 girls do a better job of fighting the undead than a trained army of men, because, you know, they studied in China. But, it's not like the men simply get tossed around by zombies and the girls toss the zombies around.Other than that, Lily James is well cast as the main character and it's interesting that they even explore this - Darcy says ""she's pretty but not too pretty, has masculine features but is still feminine"", though it didn't get much comedic effect, so it kind of fell into the ""insulting the viewers intelligence"" category.The rest of the cast do a decent job, with the Mother overacting a bit and the Father actually underacting and Lena Headley is somewhat underused, but such is her part.Bottom line, it is an interesting and somewhat funny movie, worth a watch.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
69,Quebec_Dragon,Better and fresher than its (zombie) parts,7,8 February 2016,"I've never read any Jane Austen novel, but I have watched a few traditional adaptations of her work including Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley that I really liked. Without the zombie aspect, this mash-up would be a mostly respectable and respectful adaptation of the novel in terms of tone, characters and plot if the Knightley adaptation was anything to go by. However, it does ""dirty up"" the original classic story with undead so it could be blasphemous to Austen purists. Those who consider her writing sacrosanct should definitely steer clear unless they have a strong sense of humour. The story hit the major points and had some beautiful lines, but it veered off in the last part. The whole bridge thing also confused me.The zombie aspect fit surprisingly well, was not too jarring (except at the start with Lady Featherstone), but it was not great, although I found original how some zombies still had enough brains to talk and even infiltrate society for a while. I also liked the facial makeup on some of the zombies. The zombie parts were also the catalyst for a lot of the humour. The contrast between the prim, well-spoken, 19th-century British society and the out-of-their-normal-environment zombies provided amusement. The action parts were somewhat disappointing. As an example, the first time you saw the 5 sisters jump into action, you would have expected something glorious and exhilarating, but it kind of fizzled because the moves weren't thrilling or convincing enough. Although the editing tried to hide it somewhat , you could guess that the actors were chosen more for their acting skills than their martial-arts skills (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Exceptions to the lacking action would be the human-only ones, especially the ""confrontations"" between Elizabeth and Darcy.I suppose the film is by definition a parody, but it was played very straight, and I don't think it would have worked so well otherwise. Sam Riley, the actor playing Darcy was excellent in his role. Lily James as Elizabeth didn't fare so well, lacking presence and charisma, especially at the start. She paled in comparison with Keira Knightley (in the same role), but she improved later on. The zany Matt Smith (former Doctor Who) stole almost every scene he was in, playing an unconventional Pastor Collins. By re-watching Pride and Prejudice (Knightley version) after this film, I noticed how much the characterization of the secondary characters was cut (especially the 3 younger sisters) and how much the ballroom dancing, dining and conversation was replaced with zombie shenanigans. I'm not convinced this was an improvement, but it was certainly different.I watched this at a sneak preview in a full theatre. The laughs mostly came in the first half. Personally, I smirked relatively often but never laughed out loud (I rarely do). I was entertained throughout though. What about the romantic aspect you ask? It is still there and Darcy's letter is still awesome, but it's often overridden by comedic or horrific elements. What about the gore? It can be surprising and a bit disgusting (the makeup mostly) but it's limited and over quickly. None of the parts of the film were particularly strong (except acting that was overall better than expected), but as a fun mash-up, I think it worked. For those curious, I consider the Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice superior in every regard and I don't recommend watching it too soon before this film because the latter would suffer too much in comparison.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

He re-wrote the novel preserving all the original names (and main events) and the present film is a (nice) cinematographic transposition of his work.In the past few years Science Fiction sometimes described a decadent future where all mankind creative resources had been drained off and people are entertained with countless sequels of the same story or subverted versions of renowned classics. Now that it's happening is less dreadful than I thought and is actually amusing.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
72,Mivas_Greece,"Paradoxically, a very nice mix of genres between the original plot and a thriller/action/zombie parody with some humor too.",6,28 February 2021,"Parody of the film and the book Pride and Prejudice. Excellent work has been done in the costume and representation of the time, as in the plot that remained quite close to the original one. Of course as a parody, it also had doses of humor, but also action as they are all in a fiction world where there are zombies and people have demarcated areas where they remain safe from them. In addition to zombies, elements of the Bible are also involved where a leading zombie will stand out and organize attacks on humans in the End of Days... A strangely good mix of different species that I oddly liked. Clearly watch it as a parody and not as a film based on Pride and Prejudice. Recommended for this kind of parody/thriller/action.6.5/10 from me.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The trailer looked so intriguing zombies in the 19th Century.So had to go see it. I've never read pride and prejudice so that side meant very little to me. I had no great expectations. What a good film! ( assuming you don't take anything with zombies in it too seriously.)The acting was good, the story was believable, the characters were developed and there was even some humour (Matt Smith added a lot of this). Most amazing of all, it had lots of zombies in it. It really got the balance right of, story, clichés and gore. If (like me) you like the look of the trailer, then you will almost certainly enjoy this film. I've given it 8/10 but would add another point for being much better than expected.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
75,danielharden,Jane Austin would turn in her grave.... Literally,6,17 February 2016,"Pride. And Prejudice. And Zombies. That is it, simple and ridiculous this film is confusing for me to conclude on. I liked it more than I should have.The film is Pride and Prejudice but with Zombies thrown in for random marketable reasons. It's a comedy Horror and as far as these tend to go its neither the best or worst of them, couple of chuckles, couple of jumps, all in all, an alright film.The acting in this film is fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just fine. Lily James if good playing the strong woman who will not change for any man, and Matt Smith steals the show, playing the comic relief character really well, doing the very best with what he was given. The guy who plays Mr Darcy.... WTF was the accent... That's not an accent that people have... It's like he's extremely dehydrated all the time or something.The letter which Mr Darcy writes to Elizabeth Bennett I found to be extremely lazy writing. It's probably in the Jane Austin book but in this film, everything that Mr Darcy did to make him seem like a dick was all explained and justified in one letter. In the film Mr Darcy has done nothing at all to convince the audience that he is not a complete ass and so to have a character completely change over the course of a letter being read out aloud seemed rather lazy of the writers of this film. The twist at the end of the film about Wickham being a Zombie was painfully obvious to me at least as why would he defend the Zombies, side with them and not get ripped to shreds when Lydia was rescued? It wasn't a matter of if but a matter of when really.The film includes characters such as the four horsemen of the apocalypse... Why? There was no point to them at all really as the film does literally zero with them not even having them lead the charge in the mid credit scene so really there was just no point to them to this film adaptation.Overall I went into the cinema hoping to have fun with this film and I did somehow. I can see lots wrong with the film as there clearly was but I still found myself enjoying this film as if it where a guilty pleasure film.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
76,Genti23,A few flaws but overall a really good film (with zombies),8,26 July 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a comedy horror film directed by Burr Steers who also wrote and adapted the movie from the original novel that came out in 1813. It stars Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcote, Douglas Booth, Matt Smith, Charles Dance and Lena Headey. I personally liked this movie a lot, from the acting to the well shot action sequences. It is a whole lot of fun as the movie never fails to deliver on the promise. Lily James is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses working today. She was perfect in Cinderella, and she is certainly really good here too. She was a strong and motivated character when needed and gave a really touching performance filled with emotion at times. Everybody else is also good on the role, especially Matt Smith who was incredibly funny and never failed to make me laugh. There's unfortunately not that much zombie screen time as I would have liked there to be, but the balance through the beginning between the dramatic pride and prejudice scenes, and the zombie ones was well done. The ending takes more of a drift on the zombie side, but it also ends abruptly. Considering the amount of money that it made, it seems like we're left with that ending forever now.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
77,cnycitylady,No 'Pride' or 'Prejudice' just 'Zombies',5,2 November 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a poorly stitched together attempt at reinvigorating a classic Austen tale. The story follows a heroine by the name of Elizabeth Bennet and her tempestuous and misinterpreted romance with a man named Fitzwilliam Darcy as they navigate their feelings for each other and a zombie filled landscape that they call home. Their names, however, are the only things to actually resemble the iconic story that millions of readers fall in love with every year.The film is so bloated with zombie battles and undead cries that you lose the heart of what made the book so enjoyable. The screenwriters warped and deformed the book so that the only thing you recognize in it is the name. Many a book-to-movie lover will be bewildered at the strange turns this film takes and tired out by the generic story that they've put in its place. I wouldn't recommend this to Austen fans, and I don't think I'd even recommend it to Zombie fans. 5/10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

It's a pity there were only a few cinemas showing it here on 1st weekend and we had to watch it among all in all 5 people (us included) in a theater for 200, but it finally seemed to be the perfect way.I was expecting it to be a classic cheap b-movie about zombies and I was amazed by the quality of work that had been done there. Good if not great costumes, nice victorian-age production design, good acting and even a solid plot with twists and u-turns.I really hope and trust it has the potential to become the new resident-evil kind of franchise, mixing jump-scares, action, gore, comedy and - yes - romance.

79,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 72,7,31 March 2016,"Most people are probably thinking, ""If they pull this off, it could really be great!"" And they're right. The unfortunate part is that it's fairly difficult. My only true frame of reference is the 2005 film version of the Jane Austen classic. And while it's not my favorite film of all time, I can't deny its technical achievements.This one has completely different achievements. If you're talking about special effects and makeup, then Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is accomplished, sure. But the problems lie in the story itself.The film starts out as a true black comedy. Taking place in the early 1800s, you see quaint young English women preparing their weapons for battling the undead. But first they must brush each other's hair. It's that sort of humor that runs rampant throughout much of the first act of this film. And it's much appreciated. It's not two stories at once, but the classic Austen story featuring a zombie subtext.Though, the irony is only entertaining for so long. Then it reaches a point where everything seems forced, and then the dialogue becomes rushed. It just goes through the motions in order to execute both ideas. The long runtime works for the 2005 version, but this one just tries to cover way too much ground in about 30 minutes less. And it's as though the filmmakers realize that too. So they change it up a bit. 45 minutes into the film we finally get more of the zombie action that we've been wanting. It starts getting good, but then the whole love story suffers because of it. If you can look past the massively uneven tone, you'll tend to enjoy what makes this story unique.The casting here is pretty good. The chemistry between all the lovers isn't quite there, but Lily James is more than acceptable as Elizabeth Bennet. Although, it's almost humorous to believe that she's supposed to be the less beautiful daughter between herself and Jane.If you've never been exposed to the original Jane Austen story before, then you may not even get the humor or, better yet, the story in this one. However, the adjustments made to the classic tale in order to fit into this zombie adaptation actually cause parts of the story to make more sense.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies isn't a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining at times. And It's not that they failed in what they set out to do, I just simply think it's not possible to accomplish the daunting task of combining the two stories. Perhaps it merely has too much to handle in order to have the freedom to be its own movie.Twizard Rating: 72",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The attempt at comedic implementation was unsuccessful according to myself. It all came off very cheesy.All negativity aside, this wasn't a bad movie. It possess an alternate reality in Europe during the colonial ages where people coexist with zombies. I'd almost consider it like a Van Helsingish related scenario with a touch of Kill Bill, except with three chicks and a army colonel.It can get corney but all in all it wasn't a bad flick. 6\10",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

82,Brevin_Campbell,What a fun little movie,7,22 February 2016,"I don't know what was it really about this film that made it kind of entertaining to see. Maybe it was all the women could fight really well and jump from walls. I mean seriously the movie goes so far to say they have be trained by Japanese monks. What the heck? This movie was loads of fun for what the premise was.The dialogue was amazing as well. I was truly amazed by how good it was. There were scenes where they would could speak in there new england accents and dialect while a horde of zombies were out of them and it literally felt like someone of that time period would say if there were zombies after them. Did I mention Matt Smith is in this movie. Because he was and he was perfect!! Oh my god his scenes made me laugh so hard. He was defiantly the best part of this film. I also must say Sam Wiley was also really good in this film. I liked him a lot. He actually kind of interested me too. Some faults this movie has is defiantly some of its pacing. I won't lie not everything here was really that interesting. A lot of it was, but some of it felt dull and flat for me personally. Some of the parties and arguments really fell flat to me and weren't that interesting. This movie could use some more zombie fights as well something to pass the time in the arguing and partying in the movies. Overall I think people should at least give this movie a shot if they can get it for a low price.

83,Benslie,A laughable bad film,5,28 January 2019,"First of all, the acting in this film could have been better by some of the actors. Lily James, who plays Elizabeth Bennet, probably was the only one out of the entire cast that was actually good. She wasn't just a robot, in all of her scenes at least, but showed emotion. The rest of the cast I wish I could say the same but I can't. They all barely show any emotion in any scenes. Now I have nothing against Sam Riley, who plays Mr. Darcy, but I think he was a terrible choice for Mr. Darcy. I have recently watched the 2005 film Pride and Prejudice so I do understand that Mr. Darcy is supposed to come across as emotionless and miserable to the public but when he's with Elizabeth he lightens up a bit. In this film, he's just straight up emotionless and miserable throughout the entire film. At first, I thought they used makeup for the zombies but upon further inspection they actually used CGI and it wasn't good. The reason why zombies are terrifying in this modern day and age is that movies and TV use makeup effects for their zombies. One thing I did like though was the costumes. Just by looking at the characters outfits you can easily figure out their personality. For example, with Darcy, his outfits throughout the entire film are black showing how he is miserable compared to his friend Bingley, played by Douglas Booth, who has more brighter colours showing how he is more outgoing. Finally, the musical score, composed by Fernando Velazquez, is fantastic and you can easily listen to it an understand what's going on at that point and time in the film. In the end, this film isn't great but if you turn your brain off then you'll have a good time.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I liked the casting and the costumes in the movie as well, very dapper Old English style.I liked the Pride and Prejudice elements - the setting in my opinion was a bit rushed I did not really understand who was living where and where the boundaries were - rest of England, the in between and London. There was a moat built but I was confused as the zombies seemed to be everywhere anyway? People moved here, there and everywhere so I just gave up trying to understand where they were meant to be based.So the word play between characters is fantastic - very P&P however the zombies did not seem to play a part at all - only brief moments of zombie action. I would have been great to see move, more of the struggle. Overall an entertain movie and hope for some more zombies in the future.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
85,kdavies-69347,Zombies doth not a movie maketh,4,26 April 2016,"Jumping on the zombie bandwagon, Burr Steer bets heavily on the popularity of Seth Grahame-Smith's quirky novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" Perhaps, as a desperate attempt to interest people in Jane Austen's classic story of 19th century love tirades, Grahame-Smith creates a world in which the British aristocracy are all trained in Martial Arts, Zombies talk and have some debate about the merits of eating live humans over pig brains, and that Lena Headey is still rather fetching with a plucked out eye. Sadly, zombies do not save the viewer from an absolute mediocre and downright boring film.Without delving too much into the plot line, the main story consists of a group of young well to do's, forced into what boils down to a tale of class warfare. Sam Riley, Lily James, and Jack Huston form the center of this group and end up in a rather blaze love triangle (nobody has sex in this film). Both men are rivals, from noble families, who have a sordid past of betrayal and anger towards each other, and end up fighting for the favour of the same woman, Elizabeth Bennet (James). Unfortunately the plot centers far too much on this inane romance, which never really feels real throughout the whole film.If you know the original, then you know who she chooses in the end, but this film made an absolute mistake buy trying for a cliff-hanger ending. I won't tell you what it is, but how on earth do they plan on continuing this disgraceful film is beyond me. The zombies themselves are quite talkative for the living dead. I didn't understand why, if they were of reasonable nature and capable of rational thought, that they would not work TOGETHER with society in order to treat or subdue their disease. It seems feasible enough to the viewer that if the zombies crave human flesh, but can sustain by eating pig brains, then there isn't really any reason to go to war against the human population. I understood the context of the elite rich humans vs. the poor and disenfranchised zombies, but honestly it was a pretty thin analogy for class warfare.Overall, this film is pointless and utterly missable . Zombies can't save this story unfortunately, and it certainly didn't save this film from being a box office bomb.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

In fact if you love romance, action and horror then this could be your next date movie. However I'm more of a George Romero zombie kind of guy and while there was plenty of pride at stake, lashings of prejudice there just wasn't enough threat of zombies. There wasn't even inventive ways to kill them despite the gory tools of torture at their disposal back in the day. Did I mention this is a period (yawn) film set in London and surrounds after an undead uprising type plague strikes 19th Century England. Five sisters practiced in the art of war and combat are searching for husbands in a land of zombies...just your normal dating game. Sam Riley as Mr Darcy is no Colin Firth. Thank goodness for Matt Smith oddly as a Parson not a Doctor. Even Charles Dance as Mr Bennet is wasted, but Sally Phillips as his wife is amusing.

87,arturmachado-29588,The title says it all,5,2 September 2017,"Just another adaptation of Jane Austen's novel but this time with zombies on the mix. The plot does not vary much from the original novel but contains these changes: instead of the bubonic plague, we have the zombie plague; the aristocrats, in addition to having a literary education, are also sent to China or Japan to learn martial arts due to the zombie threat; and the Bennet sisters, besides being beautiful and educated, are also fierce warriors with more childish than aristocratic ways. There is a part where Liz Bennet, instead of pushing her suitor away with the cynicism and coolness worthy of her social class, does not: they go into physical confrontation as if she were a ho discussing with her pimp in one of Bronx ghettos, only with refined language.The plot where zombies can talk and organize in community is poorly explained and could have been better explored. They should have put more emphasis on the zombies, as they have very little screen time. There is a part where one of the sisters sees the supposed 4 horsemen of the apocalypse facing back, but it is only this scene for a second or two; where do they fit in the middle of it all? We do not know because they never show up again. What purpose then has this scene?This film is only ""Pride and Prejudice"" in a zombie universe and nothing more, just to captivate more female audience to the zombie lovers wagon. As a final note I admit that production, costumes, direction, cinematography and performances are of very good level and in the end fulfills its function: to entertain and pass some time and then move on to better things.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The sisters have been trained in deportment, manners, and the deadly art of using muskets and swords. The skills of weaponry are necessary in the world the sisters live in unfortunately! Zombies of all shapes, sizes, and genders are rising from the dead and holding the countryside in a grip of terror with their insatiable appetite for brains. The sisters have been trained in China to be lean, mean killing machines against this threat.The girls team up with the dashing zombie killer, Fitzhugh Darcy (Sam Riley)who has a crush on Lizzie Bennet. Darcy owns a jar full of carrion flies that can find zombie characteristics in someone who doesn't look like a zombie. Before the revealed zombie can eat Darcy's brain, he dispatches them with his musket. The Bennet girls are especially quick in killing these zombies and are excellent students in handling weapons and martial arts. However, one woman does surpass the Bennet sisters in the deadly arts. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) is famous for her abilities and the fact she lost an eye during the zombie uprising and wears an eye patch. I heard of ""PPZ"" and read the book the movie is based on. At first, I thought the idea of incorporating zombies into this Jane Austen classic was a mistake, but after reading the book and watching the movie I felt Miss Austen would be pleased with the new-found interest in her stories! The actresses who are the Bennet sisters and the actor was is Darcy are great to watch in the dramatic scenes and when the zombie mayhem starts, all of them are exciting to watch in the fight scenes. The fight scenes are rather thrilling to watch and when a zombie gets his or her head cut off or blown off with a musket, there is very little blood if any. I recommend this movie for anyone who is into Jane Austen books or into the zombie scene. I do hope other Quirk classics are turned into movies as well!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I can't say it met all my expectations, but it could've been worse.I thought the film should have been funnier. The premise is so absurd- yet the film refuses to admit the inherent joke. For me, this was constantly a source of frustration. I couldn't tell if the over-seriousness of the film was a conscious decision by the director, or due to his lack of finesse.Giving up on the direction itself being funny, Matt Smith is amazing, and for me made the film worth watching. He is hilarious. And naturally, Jane Austin's novel has tons of wit to begin with, so some of that humor survives here, as well.The acting is pretty good, and satisfied my desire to see the authentic Pride and Prejudice characters in a zombie apocalypse. Although Mrs. Bennet was too nice, it still worked.The action was fairly run-of-the-mill. None of the fight scenes are too memorable, but it's definitely awesome to see these Victorian ladies and lads kick-ass against zombies anyway.I'd say proceed with caution on this one; only for fans of Jane Austin who have a sick sense of humor.

This is not one. What it mostly is an attempt to foist off yet another one of those wretched Mary Sue characters, that got cloned from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I loved Buffy, but the clones she spawned are meager, shallow, ugly things. I understand why they persist, The appeal is twofold. The adolescent boys like watching the big busted amazons fight in their cleavage baring outfits. The adolescent girls, and some like minded adult women, have the wish fulfillment of a female character that fights like she can beat up special forces soldiers, show off her playboy body to full advantage without being called slutty (because a woman that beats people up is a feminist, right?), and who has the boys panting after her even though she is unkind, uncooperative, and most often scowling. There is really never any reason given as to how she can best people who are bigger, stronger, have the weight and reach advantage, superior experience, and seem more intelligent. I guess if you need a reason its, like girl power? Right? This film has a whole family of the things.and zombies. Oh, and the necessary males for these girls to sneer at, and who will then come running after them.

In my opinion, it is!The movie is truly Pride and Prejudice...and Zombies; it follows the basic outline of the P&P novel, even some of the same dialog, but throws in zombies.

I would've expected it to be above 7.5 at least. Having said that judging by the box office receipts, many people disagree with me. So here's my take. I have read Pride and Prejudice and I've seen most of the TV and film adaptations. And of course the 1995 BBC adaptation is by far the best in my opinion and there is no finer Mr Darcy than Colin Firth. I believe that Sam Riley comes a creditable second to Colin in exuding the prideful, arrogant nature of Jane Austen's hero who falls to the conqueror of all of us, love. Lily James is an excellent Elizabeth Bennett again only second, in my opinion to Jennifer Elhe. Lily like Jennifer brought the strong, independent and fiery nature of Jane's Elizabeth to life. So why the poor reviews and box office receipts? The answer I suspect is that people could not accept the classic horror crossover. But I insist that it works. Mr Darcy being a respected soldier works, Elizabeth being a martial artist that can kick ass works. And has England been subject to a plague in its history.

99,ryanmark-57919,"Silly but Very Fun Movie, Jane Austen would be Proud",7,8 February 2016,"This movie is a bit of a surprise to me since I wasn't really expecting much from it. The trailers looked alright but I didn't know if it would be something that I would get into. I wouldn't go so far to say that it's an excellent film or anything like that but I did have a lot of fun with this one. The story is straight up ridiculous but if you go into it expecting a silly story with a little bit of action then I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy yourself. The movie is directed by a guy named Burr Steers who, to be honest, I have no knowledge whatsoever of anything he has done in the past. Still, he did a decent job in my opinion. Let's talk about the plot.The title of the movie isn't just a reference to the time period. This story is literally a retelling of the original novel written by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her sisters live in an alternate version of nineteenth century England where a zombie virus has forced the bulk of the populace behind a wall around London. Elizabeth and her sisters have trained in various styles of martial arts in order to survive in this world. Elizabeth is proud of her ability and refuses to succumb to the temptation of marriage unless her husband respects her wishes and allows her to continue to hone her skills. She soon meets a man named Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) who offends her pride and stands between a successful relationship between his best friend and Elizabeth's sister. Oh, and there are tons of zombies around that everyone occasionally fight against.I wouldn't call this the best cast I've ever seen but they do a decent enough job. Lily James gives us the haughtiness required of any good Elizabeth and she can also show off the fighting skills necessary to survive the zombie apocalypse. I also enjoyed Sam Riley's Mr. Darcy. Once again, nothing too spectacular but he gives a decent portrayal of the character. I like that they made him a bit unlikable which is how I imagined Mr. Darcy when I first read the novel in high school (the original, I mean). One character that does stand out to me is Matt Smith's portrayal of Parson Collins. I found this guy hilarious with they way he was able to make those around him cringe with his actions or just by saying whatever came into his head. He might actually be one of the best parts of the film.There are a lot of spooky looking forests in this movie that help to set the tone pretty well. I did find myself wondering why everyone keeps taking shortcuts through this ridiculously dangerous forest though. I really enjoyed the actual look of the zombies. The zombies that haven't eaten any human flesh yet actually retain the ability to speak which is really unsettling (and a bit comedic) from some of these creatures. The faces of some of them are straight up falling off the skull and they look surprisingly convincing.One thing that I wasn't aware of at first but this movie follows the original story very closely. I thought the title was just a reference to the time period but a lot of this film is straight up conversations made from Jane Austen. They just tweaked the plot to allow for all the zombies and other mayhem going on. I was surprised by this at first but it actually works well. The movie is still silly and is a bit difficult to take seriously but it does have some really fun parts to it. This obviously won't be for everyone but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I do think it works even better to come into the film already having knowledge of the original story just so you can see how many things they changed and what they kept the same. I recommend it to fans of the original that just so happen to enjoy an average to good zombie flick. It kind of reminds me of that Victor Frankenstein movie that came out a little while ago. Not a fantastic film but still offers a fun time at the theater.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

It was very funny, witty and thoroughly absorbing. The acting was excellent - Matt Smith, as others have said is wonderful - and the production superb. The peculiarities of the novel are self evident and, when the zombie influences are absent, you could think you are watching another excellent version of Pride and Prejudice. I have now read many reviews on here and am pleased to find that many reviewers have given the film praise. The low score is disappointing so I can only assume that many people have just written off the film either not having watched it or are just trying to be clever and above it all. Some reviews I've read are really quite pompous in their approach. If you have an open mind, an imagination and, preferably a liking for both Austen and zombies you will find this film irresistible.

This is called Pride Prejudice and Zombies and yet the zombies ARE BARELY IN THE MOVIE which is false advertising to many movie goers who are expecting to see zombies. This film didn't know if it wanted to be the actual pride and prejudice or pride prejudice and zombies, the filmmakers should have thought about that before going into production.This film had a good premise, but suffered due to poor direction, for the most part bad acting, pitiful cinematography, and lack of understanding of what it's supposed to be.

105,modernmonstersdotnet,Manslaughterfield Park,6,21 September 2016,"Jane Austen and zombis, an absurd mash-up? Think twice: the exiguity of an estate, the difficulty to find someone not already smitten/bitten, the iron rule of survival in the hostile environment of a meat market, social or visceral Seth Grahame-Smith's 2009 concept novel of the same name was killing to be clever and very successful, so a movie adaptation was to be expected. It is unfortunate that it took seven years to bring it on screen, overfed as we are in 2016 by all things zombi.It would be both herculean and meaningless to cross-reference Pride+Prejudice+Zombis with both its original sources or any or all of the previous Jane Austen adaptations, including, yes, The Bridget Jones' Diary. No plot recap is necessary anyway: Elisabeth Bennet, elder of a sorority of five girls when the estate is bequested to a male heir, Parson Collins, Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, both wealthy bachelors, are as familiar to most as Frankenstein and his creature. If it entices some of its audience to read Jane Austen, hell, this movie is no The Walking Dead. Perspective is all.So, what about this particular piece of work? The trailer made one expecting the worst, a bodice-ripping Sucker Punch with zombi attacks as the alpha and the omega of the movie. Fortunately, it is much better than that. But no action movie this is. Successful at conversation pieces but quite lame at zombi mayhem, one suspects the movie achieves the exact opposite that it was aiming at: a clever adaptation of a classic by virtue of good dialogue instead of an doomsday invasion, its zombis more catalytic than apocalyptic. Lines like ""It must have have cost a fortune to clean the zombi blood from this marble"" are pitch perfect; recitation of Jane Austen's lines during Shaolin training feels forced.Some scenes are unintentionally hilarious, like the five sisters massacring a whole zombi hamlet with not a drop of blood staining their white ball gloves, or Mr Darcy tending at the topiary by moonlight, not once but twice. Some are just really well written, like Elisabeth Bennett (Lily James) laughing at an hideous painting or Parson Collins (Matt Jones) small talk during a quadrille. As is most unfortunately usual, the third act is a mess, almost but not saved by a final scene who says it all: fighting was useless from the get-go, see, and the movie has no qualms admitting it is. Is it irony or shamelessness, one wonders.""I was in the middle before knowing I has started"", states one of the original novel's most famous line. In this instance, one was in the middle when one hoped it ended. Too long at 1:47, Pride+Prejudice+Zombis is nevertheless much better than expected from its undead genre. One is fervently awaiting more of the same, like Henry James' The Golden Cup of Blood or Charles Dicken's Our Mutual Fiend.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
106,DrMMGilchrist,The only Jane Austen dramatisation I've ever enjoyed!,9,7 January 2017,"'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' manages to improve on both versions of the book (the original and the zombie version), with an exciting and entertaining plot, comedy that is actually funny, and plenty of action. I only wish that the book I was forced to study for O Level in 1981 had included zombies and swordfights. The characters were delightfully portrayed (the film gains from being played straight), and the use of so much of the original dialogue gives it a curious air of authenticity – reminiscent of 'Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell'. The locations and costumes are lovely, and Lena Headey is especially stunning as the eye-patch wearing veteran warrior Lady Catherine. Matt Smith as Mr Collins is hilarious, rather than simply irritating. I would recommend this to anyone who was bored out of their mind by the original.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Then along came a crazy man called Seth Grahame-Smith added zombies, ninjas and martial arts to the story. Right, as if such thing would work! That guy is on crack! THEN YOU BITE YOUR TONGUE CAUSE THE NOVEL WITH THE ZOMBIES IS AWESOME!If you haven't read it yet, do it, it is so much fun! And don't worry if you already watched the movie, they have the same name but their stories are totally different. I'm serious! Not ""it's an adaptation of the book"" different, but ""I'll keep the title and the characters, the rest I'll throw away and re-write it!"" different. THAT DIFFERENT!Damn you Burr Steers!For all it! First for a PG-13 zombie movie. I see more blood when my girlfriend bites my lip than in this movie. For ignoring ninjas. You tried to keep it safe with a zombie movie, man with that source material you should have gone totally bananas! For just saying f*ck it to all the strong female characters of both novels. For making me say that Wickham was right! He was the only reasonable among homicidal pedant aristocrats. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ZOMBIES!Lydia and Wickham ""love-story"" was completely ignored. We had a two minutes dance between Jane and Bingley... They never saw each other until their marriage at the end of the movie. We barely had any Liz and Darcy time on screen. And the battle royale. It is teased a battle between Liz and Lady Catharine, but in the end just a ridiculous battle between Wickham and Darcy.What I saw was the corruption of literary work about women. Both sources are about strong woman who stand up and don't let themselves be subjugated by any male. The Bennet sisters, the deadly Bennet sisters are no more than damsels in distress, in this movie. They kick some ass and then nothing. THAT IS A SHAME!Casting-wise. I liked Sam Riley, Matt Smith and Jack Houston. Sam could play Darcy in a straight adaptation of the original novel and would be amazing. Matt as Collins was the comic relief, sometimes forced, sometimes perfect, he was quite well in the part. And Jack's Wickham was very good, he was quite charming as was supposed to, but because of the poor writing there was no deceitful Wickham.Among the women. I didn't really saw three of the Bennet sisters, they were barely in the movie. I liked Bella Heathcote as Jane, she was no Rosamund Pike, but balanced the delicate and lovely, but didn't had enough time on screen. Lena Headey was another one. Visually perfect as Lady Catherine, but the few lines she had were kind of lame. She would be awesome kickin' zombie ass and Lizzie's ass also.The so called protagonist, Liz Bennet, by Lily James. As the whole movie, the character was poorly written, so I don't know if she could do any better. Just for taste, I would change her for Lily Collins. I think Collins would fit better as Liz Bennet and is a better actress than James. Bottom line... I was really looking forward to this movie, probably the first one of the year, but it was a mess... It's hard to imagine how it could be worse... The writing was the thing that doomed this project.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
109,elliest_5,Less Pride and Prejudice! More Zombies!,6,29 September 2017,"Having seen many of the old - and slightly tired - screen adaptations of Jane Austen's book, I had been longing for a looser adaptation that would breathe new life into the story and would reflect a more modern representation of what counts as a strong female protagonist. Although I wasn't expecting a zombie parody to fully satisfy this need, I watched this film expecting a nice blend of comedy-romance-female badassery.P&P&Z can indeed be credited with some achievements (and even dare-I-say improvements to the original dynamics of the plot): the female characters are also warriors, there is an external motivator to the plot, other than the dull issue of who is going to marry whom, there is action and there is even the potential of well-justified character development and motivation for the two central characters (e.g. there's no much to justify the moodiness of Mr Darcy in the original, other than his minor family troubles, whereas in this one he is a seasoned zombie hunter who has seen and lived through a lot) The problem is that the film (sticking to the P&P&Z book, I presume, which is a parodic exercise) decides to keep whole chunks of P&P intact, retaining the original text and feel, despite the zombie apocalypse that's added into the equation. With that, it feels that we're basically watching two films at once, switching between the two every now and then. The parts that integrate both concepts organically are very few, while at times the mixture between the two elements is done unsuccessfully, resulting in caricature.I think the film should have taken itself more seriously, despite the ridiculousness of the premise, because it did have potential. If the P&P affiliation had been looser and the zombie apocalypse scenario had worked out as the main story-line, then we could have had a great movie.I still liked the comedic feel though - Parson Collins (Matt Smith) in particular was great.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

111,rossini-1868,Mankind is doomed...,8,26 February 2017,"Zack Snyder must have either been jumping for joy or writhing in jealousy over parts of this weird and wonderful movie. The director (somebody named Burr Steers) understood from the ground up what matters about this movie is less the zombie half than the Pride and Prejudice half, ie, beautiful women and pretty girls walking around in cleavage and cute smiles, wielding knives like ninja warriors and guns like bounty hunters. All of that nonsense was so artfully disguised in beauty and civility that the movie was a visual feast, and just might have the most plausible feel for the whole ridiculous zombie concept that I have ever seen.The director was smart enough to balance the typical dashing male lead with an elegant damsel, who wields her zombie killing sword with Crouching Tiger-esque skill and loveliness besides. Sadly, this won't become a model for future horror efforts, as movies continue to get dumber and dumber, where the watchability goes no further than a brilliant trailer and big special effects. I didn't understand half of what the heck everybody was cooing, mumbling and whispering about in this movie. But between the brains, beauty and breasts that decorated this gem of a story, it didn't really matter.The movie is a visual masterpiece. As complete an end of the world warning as has ever been made. Despite our attempt at cultured civility, man is a fallen, corrupted force in creation. The overriding reason for this movie comes from a line in the movie itself: ""the human race is surely doomed.""",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Lady Catherine as England's foremost warrior queen fits in well, and Lily James's kick-ass Lizzy rebuffs Darcy's first proposal with convincing violence.The period atmosphere is quite well done, with the Bennett's home transformed into a fortified manor with martial arts training.

We love zombie movies and this brought some nice changes to the usual zombie setup. It was worth it just to see how zombies may have been challenged without any of today's technology.Acting was spot on. It is hard enough to pull of period drama with a straight face never mind with zombies left and right but the cast does a great job.

114,kastenmeier-andreas,Could have been more Fun,5,18 April 2017,"Movies like this are having a hard time. Adapting a classic novel or story and adding some kind of monsters seems to be a trend in Hollywood. There are many really bad entries like ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", ""Dracula Untold"" or ""The Brothers Grimm"". Now this is the second adaptation of a zombie novel by Seth Grahame-Smith after ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"", a enjoyable but mediocre movie.Exactly the same is to say about ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"". Let's start with the good parts. Easily the most enjoyable part is the main character played by Lily James. I don't know why she is not getting more attention. Besides her obvious beauty, she is really doing a great acting job here. Which leads me to the next positive part, the story part that's directly adapted from the Jane Austen novel. I wasn't expecting that much ""Pride & Prejudice"", but that worked and was portrayed very well.The demerits are the zombie parts of this movie. It felt randomly added to the plot. If you add zombies you should have much more fun, more darkness and horror, but instead most of the movies run time people are running into some zombies and killing them in fast cut scenes. And even in the end, where you could have started a fun fest of zombie killing it's just zombies running at them and never really being a thread.So in the end, I was disappointed, because the concept was wasted and could have been way more fun.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I was not quite sure how on earth this movie was going to play out but in the end it she just rocked. Keep in mind I really enjoyed keiras performance in the original non zombie version. One downer in this film is that sadly this Mr Darcy just did not have the gravitas that several prior MR. Darcy's have had. Perhaps it was because he was so young looking, looking more like 22 than the typical 30 plus actors I have seen in the past that seem more believable when they push back on the elder aristocracy in scenes, they should have pulled in an actor 5 or 10 years his senior.

I assumed that this would be no different and that it would just be the same exact story with a few zombies sprinkled in. And to an extent, it was exactly that, but there was much more depth to the zombie plot than I anticipated. The zombies were a very large part of the story and even when there was romantic drama there was still a close focus on the zombie aspect. There is always that underlying tension that zombies will strike. The visuals were not the best but were still very well done. The make-up and effects for the zombies were much higher quality than I thought they would be. And the atmosphere kept a good mix of an old Pride and Prejudice feel while also adding a new element of dark zombie-apocalypse tension that I loved seeing.

This is no Schindler's List (1993) or an epic movie like Gone With The Wind (1939).What this movie has is: (1) Far better acting and script writing and witty dialogue then 50 Shades of Grey(2015). Ask yourself this, if your were drunk, would you want to watch a dull BDSM movie or a kick arse zombie movie? (2) Cinematography: just watch the camera as it has those wide shots of the English manors. Visually the movie well crafted. (3) Cast: Lily James, Sam Riley, Lena Headey and Charles Dance (taking a break from the Game Of Thrones set), and Matt Smith. Good acting and nicely timed comic relief. AND I might add all the actors have not lost the personality of the P&P characters. (4) This is the 3rd P&P adaption in which the P&P cast closely matched the age of the P&P in the books. (the other two being Pride and Prejudice (2005) and Lost in Austin (2008)). (5) Costume: very authentic, however the costume Julian Day designer did do a nice job of blending the period ensemble with practical ""modern"" updates. Seriously I ain't fight zombies in empire style dress without my leather jeans underneath my skirts? (6) Sets and Location: The movie could of skimped on the location and made sets, but the producers didn't. The sets are real and they give the movie a more realistic look. (7) Audiences need to look at the Lighting in this movie. How the candle light flickers across the actors faces, the contrast between shadows in a room. Watch the dungeon scene where Lizzy and Jane are practicing and check out the blues and whites in the room contrasting with the black/gray shadows.I have read the harsh criticism of reviews, and having seen the movie, it did not faze me one bit.

The original issues of class remain (the wealthy train in Japan, the less wealthy in China etc).There were some changes to narrative sequence, at least in the film version, Eg Lizzie doesn't visit long at Pemberley etc. And the plot regarding Lydia altered.The actors seemed to have fun with their roles and the new world, and the spirited nature of Lizzie remained. James and Riley were great as Bennett and Darcy.Frankly, her rejection of Darcy's first proposal in this is the best rejection ever. I won't spoil it. Suffice to say, if you feel you and you're family have been slighted, all manners of polite regency society are aside. LOLDo not take this film seriously as an adaptation of Austen. Take it for what it is: a fun, reimagining of a much loved story.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
127,DannyDnB,Wasted potential.,5,5 December 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is exactly what the title says it is. It's the classic Jane Austen story with a twist. The film is based on a novel that was published a few years ago, and I don't know what the book is like, but as far a movies go, this one, while flawed, turns out to be surprisingly fun.The most important thing to bear in mind here is that the movie feels very much like any other pride and prejudice film adaptation. The addition of the zombies is a trope that is used in the mix, and is actually quite an interesting idea. The premise of the film is rather unique which is something I liked about the movie. The performances are all good too, particularly those of Lily James and Sam Riley. I actually found myself getting lost in the world the movie presents to us. The depiction of the setting of the original story is authentic and rather vibrant in a very comical kind of way. The dialogue fits and with the combination of all of these different elements, the film ends up being a lot better than I thought it was going go be.Unfortunately the movie falls short at one very important element, the zombies. I feel like the main attraction point of the piece is the zombies, and failing at that is the one thing that should not have happened. We get some scenes with awesome potential to really be a lot more stylish and effective than what they turn out to be.The movie will entertain you if you are a fan of the source material or you just want some mindless fun, but even then there is a sense of wasted opportunity of what could have been a very classy yet stylish zombie movie.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
128,natcarr-74-27114,"Underated fun for fans of zombies, kickass female action leads and comedy.",8,5 March 2019,"Its taken me a long time to finally see this movie. Everytime I read a review it got panned. 2/5 stars or 3/10 or 41% etc etc. Let me put all the pretentious self-important critics right.
This film is fun! It's nicely paced, Matt Smith is really funny in The Office comedy style. The Bennet sisters are gorgeous and powerful in the same way as Kate Beckinsale in underworld or Scarlet Johansson as Blackwidow. The premise is gloriously silly like something out of Big Train.
I knocked a couple of points off because the male stars dont hold their own, save for the ever reliable Charles Dance. But critics need to realise this movie is not a period drama. It is not the next 28 days later. Its a silly funny mash up that does what it wanted to do. Bring on great expectations with vampires!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
129,Stararmour,Perfect!,9,10 May 2016,"This was a PERFECT watch for women's day! It so happened that the day I watched the film was women's day, and I could not have picked a more feminist film if I wanted to (and I had no such intention!).The girls are brilliantly charming, well trained fighters, and perfect examples of the different priorities sisters often have. The Darcy was a little annoying with his permanently brooding expression (even more so than E Cullen in the first of the Twilight installments, but at least he didn't glitter in the sun! :P And, of course, the character is meant to be portrayed as such. The action is fast paced and decently enough crafted. I mean, you won't get martial art perfection here, but it is smooth enough for a bunch of Victorian men and women. This is a movie that makes fun of the Victorian film genre and zombie films at the same time, without really being a spoof of either. It never takes itself too seriously, so it successfully avoids becoming ridiculous - even with the title it has. The zombies are also well done! And the twist (yes, there is one) is pretty darn good too. The plot lines are simple and clean - with no extra bits thrown in simply to satisfy a genre-audience. All in all, time well spent. Will rewatch!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I'm against the idea of messing with classic novels this way. It's OK to make parodies sometimes, but this is neither parody nor a zombie movie. I enjoyed the romantic part of this story but sneered at the zombie part. Not quite sure what the intention of the people behind this movie was or what they were trying to say. If a movie doesn't deliver a message, it has to be entertaining. Other than that it's questionable. This movie is not OK with the zombie part. If we take out the zombie scenes, the movie wouldn't be ruined.

It's got a great cast and they do a really good job. I was very pleasantly surprised with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.It's a romance. It's horror. It's comedy.Go for the fun of it and don't take it seriously. This is not a classic Victorian novel and this is not a true tale of zombies like most die hard zombie fans think of them (ie. The Walking Dead or the more classic Night of the Living Dead). I am a true zombie lover. I loved ""28 Days Later"", ""The Walking Dead"", ""Zombieland"", etc. This is not one of those, so if you don't expect to see that when you go to this movie, I think you will enjoy it.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
134,steben,Brainless indulgence,6,21 May 2016,"A strangely underrated, very stylish,occasionally funny and well-paced movie.While perhaps not breathtakingly original, this movie is well-executed, well-directed, with some good acting and a few passable jokes thrown in. If that doesn't sound ecstatic, it's because this movie isn't exactly awesome, but it's still decent fun and it offers a somewhat fresh look at two genres at once (classic romance and zombie apocalypse). It might be a good point to start one's girlfriend's interest in the zombie genre if you wish.My only real disappointment was that the one character from the original novel that I wished (and expected) to turn into a zombie didn't, but for the sake of spoilers, I won't divulge who it was (n't).Lastly, cinematography, locations, sound and costumes (i.e. ""looks and feels"") of this movie are spot on. Again, in the age of so many inept, vapid films, this one doesn't deserve its low rating and might be worth a casual glance if you're looking for some, well... brainless... indulgence.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
135,BenignPillows,Unexpected delight!,8,20 February 2018,"I finally got around to watching this, and laughed my head off, and I actually think Jane Austen would have as well. I'm not even a zombie horror fan, but this is such a great comedy, while retaining the power of the love story, that I still loved it. I don't feel it disrespects Pride and Prejudice; it's a homage more than a parody. It can't be denied that the story is made less character-driven - to put it that way, it's not INNER demons Elizabeth and Darcy are fighting anymore. However, it's still clear that the movie endeavours to take the novel's themes and love story seriously, and the actors, especially Lily James, play it straight and give it their all. I found the constantly leather-clad Sam Riley a bit lacking as Darcy, but Lily James would be a good Lizzy in any version of P&P. It's just, in this one, she is a martial arts champion as well. Another aspect that prevents this from seeming trashy, is that the production values and cinematography are surprisingly good. Apparently it was mostly filmed on location, and that shows.This also may contain the best Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet I have seen - though, granted, that may be because they are made more sympathetic than in the novel. Matt Smith is priceless and Sally Phillips hasn't got enough credit for her hilarious Mrs Bennet.The script and comedic timing are what make this an excellent comedy. I loved the historical revision that explains the invasion of period zombies in England - blamed on the French, of course. I loved how Darcy is recast as a zombie hunter and Lady Catherine as a warrior legend (Lena Headey was underused, though). I love the girl power element inherent in the fact that instead of embroidering, the Bennet sisters polish their weapons in their free time, and their deep conversations of love are had whilst doing combat training. I loved small directorial touches like the camera staying with Mr Collins after his unsuccessful proposal; we hear Mrs Bennet screeching off-screen followed by a quiet ""Bugger"" from Collins. I didn't see this in a theatre, but if I had, the scene where Elizabeth responds to Darcy's first proposal by *kicking him in the stomach* would have been worth the ticket price entirely!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
136,michaellynton,"Boring, jumbled up mess of a movie.",2,1 March 2016,"I thought this might be fun and entertaining if not a good piece of filmmaking. I was wrong. Tedious, badly acted for the most part, but then the script is so mediocre I don't entirely blame the actors, some of them, or the director who clearly doesn't know how to direct actors. The real problem is the source material. Just putting zombies in a classic novel is not enough to turn into a movie, it's just not, and it upsets me that this is allowed to happen and that people spent good money making it. Some teenage boys will enjoy this and that's about it. I know that's the target audience of studios these days but I think it's a crying shame. Maybe if you'd had better writers, a director who could work with actors and actors who are less concerned with how they look and more about their character this could have been better. But that's a big maybe.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Unfortunately, I think that if one were to illustrate such a Venn diagram, they would find the overlap is very small, and that those of us who appreciate the crude humor and violence of zombie movies are not the same ""us"" who enjoy historical melodrama...However, this film does in fact- exist. As such, I do not think it is any better (or worse) than what is implied by its title (The most humorous point of the entire endeavor). This is a zombie movie set in the realm of Pride & Prejudice, and in order to enjoy it you apparently have to be better versed in the source material than I was. Overall - my favorite thing about this film was the opening alt- historical sequence ""An Illustrated History of Brittania"" which was created with such care and joy that I could not help but get roped in to the silly merriment.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

That is unfortunate.In short: If you are looking for camp or if you are looking to laugh out loud, this movie is not what you want.The film is a serious take and very well done. The story is compelling, the characters are interesting. It is both suspenseful and thrilling.There are lots of strong female characters who are portrayed in an admirable, but believable way. The movie is intelligent and appropriately paced with numerous action sequences. I have not seen or read any versions of Pride and Prejudice nor have I read the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel. As such, I have no idea if having read Jane Austen's book will make the story more predictable or less. Either way, the film is masterfully done and enjoyable in its own right.Just keep in mind that while it is a spoof (and is fun), it is not meant to be funny.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

With that said, P&P&Z exceeded my expectations. The mix between sophisticated Empire England and braincraving zombies was refreshing. As someone who read Seth Graham-Smiths Pride and Prejudice and Zombies let me tell you that the first 30 Minutes were very accurate. The rest of the story got hoolywood-ized. I guess that was a good choice because you want to see some action and drama if you pay for a ""Just-for-entertainment-movie""The cast, expect Sam Rileys, was really fitting. The costumes and setting were fun to look at and the music and fighting was well performed.

I love the story from Pride and prejudice I think it is one of the greatest love stories so elegant and charismatic but yet....in this case you just stare and wonder... how on earth did anyone had such an insane idea to mix together Pride and prejudice with Resident Evil? I basically watched the movie because I love the storyline from pride and prejudice and I want to see all ecranisations and also read the book 3 times but as far as this movie I will only recommend if you wanna have a good laugh and then give yourself a slap in the face that you actually saw it. There are some things that don't make any sense and the story moves so fast, boom now you are at the ball now you are in the middle of the battlefield and so on. But it doesn't make much sense this movie and I believe that his purpose was to be a Twilight parody with zombies than an actually romance action SF movie. Horror is an overstatement , because the horror part is that they keep show disfigured people and they keep cut their head off, so there is not for small kids but still horror is to much said, is a chick zombie flick :))",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Unfortunately with nothing like that existing, I'd presume that the best chance of this movie making it to a notable list is to become a B-classic. Meaning that bad that is actually good. Although certain scenes manage to convey Austen's fans frustration (i.e. the proposal at Collin's house) over certain passages which we would have enjoyed if they had some more energy, this movie doesn't manage to captivate neither a P&P fan nor a gore/thriller one. The acting is mediocre, the direction somewhat going crazy and the plot that of a nice fanfiction. hard to believe that such a book made it to the shelves. In short what you think you get is what you will eventually get. A messed up classic which could have been somewhat enjoyable but loses focus pretty quickly. A shame really, but still perhaps enjoyable for a low key Halloween night. My advice for those who will attempt to watch it is to proceed with caution. Do not expect anything grand and you might actually enjoy it.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
145,genslen,Something is amiss in the countryside,7,1 November 2018,"Surprisingly well done. It's exactly like the original book, except that in this version, England and the Bennet sisters are faced with a overwhelming threat: a plague of zombies inhabits the countryside. Those who don't fight back are destined to be turned into shuffling beasts in search of human brains. Some of it is quite silly, but it's fun to see the characters--and the actors--taking everything so seriously. Lily James and Sam Riley inhabit their lead roles without a hint of sarcasm or a knowing wink at the audience.The zombie threat and past conflicts with them are incorporated perfectly into the narrative, with a new angle: in this England, young woman are sent away to be trained in martial arts. Elizabeth and her sisters spend much time training with swords or flipping around, hacking off zombie heads. But there is real drama and romance among the characters--Mr. Darcy is a tool, Elizabeth is inexplicably drawn to him, Bingley and Jane Bennet make the perfect couple--but it seems they're constantly being interrupted by zombies at the gates.The writers did a great job of making it all feel fairly believable--London is under siege, ringed with battlements and a wide no-man's-land to protect the city. A limited number of bridges into the capital remain, guarded by the living. Each country manor home and stately castle is shown topped with new defenses and ringed with wicked, barbed fences and unbreachable gates.

On that scene, i was not sure whether I should laugh.In some part, it felt like I really was watching Jane Austen's adaptation, but in another part, i felt that the zombie part was just stitched to the story and did not actually have a meaning.

150,KurotsutaMurasaki,"A movie, based on a novel... based on a novel.",5,6 February 2016,"There are good things about this film. There are also some things very, very wrong with it.As one who is a History nerd, and a fan of the original novel AND someone who also enjoys the concept of a empire waist gown that can be swept aside to access a bladed weapon strapped to a Regency lady's stocking thigh, I had certain expectations (Some of them not very high).I was rather surprised at how well they handled some things. The Dialogue (at least on Darcy's part) wasn't as terribly dumbed down as I had feared. I was particularly fond of Darcy's admiration of Elizabeth's form and figure while fighting (The comment about her arms being muscular, but no so much as to be unfeminine"" particularly tickled me) and the translation of Elizabeth and Darcy's verbal sparring into actual physical sparring in Darcy's proposal scene truly impressed me. The lines were well placed and well executed. In all (apart from some casting objections) the first half of the movie was pretty darn solid.Lily James was just not a good choice for Elizabeth Bennett. She's not a very good actress to be honest. Again - I KNOW this is not a straight up adaptation of Pride And Prejudice, but as these characters ARE based on those of that novel they must, by necessity, follow the behaviors and action of those characters, or what is the point in naming the film ""Pride and Prejudice"" when Jane Austen fans everywhere object to its mere existence, and the average Zombie movie attendee probably wouldn't know who Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are anyway. Elizabeth is spunky, and uncommonly tomboyish for her time to be sure, but she is also best known for her SENSE. She's got some very strong opinions about Darcy when she meets him yes, but P&P&Z Lizzie is so headstrong as to seem silly and mediocre. What makes her even stranger to the casual viewer is that she is SO vocal about her opinions on Darcy from the offset, that when Darcy insults her looks, she behaves like a teenage girl who's biggest crush called her fat at the prom, it seems a bit stupid. What is more, Jane clearly shows more Zombie Slaying mettle than Elizabeth. When faced with the undead remains of a mother and baby, she, while horrified, doesn't let sentimentality cloud her sense and dispatches them (I assume - the screen goes black and cuts away as the zombies charge - as she survives the encounter, her only wound being a scorch mark on her hand where her musket backfired)Sam Riley is passable as Darcy. He does carry off the character as an experienced Zombie hunter; His one great defect in the role is the fact that Darcy, while an expert at Undead Slaying, is also a Gentleman of distinction and pride. Sam Riley simply isn't genteel enough for the role. Mrs. Bennett wasn't sensational enough, and an over-the-top version of this character with many a loud, EXASPERATED exclamation of ""OH, MR BENNETT!"" was very much called for, and was not delivered. My only complaint on the count Charles Dance as the dry Mr. Bennett, is that there wasn't enough of him.And while I love the idea of Lady Catherine DeBurgh being an eye-patch bearing warrior woman played by Lena Headey, she would have been much more entertaining if they had included some of Lady Catherin's more ridiculous lines which would have given Lena some irresistible opportunities to be her Headey-est and chew the scenery in high dudgeon. What is worse, we don't even get to see Lady Catherin and Lzzie fully duke it out, which Lady Catherin DOES directly challenge Elizabeth to combat in the novel (The zombie novel, that is, not Miss Austen's original work. Matt Smith as the odious Mr. Collins! He might be one of the best, most delightfully cringe-worthy incarnations of the oily parson I've ever seen. As with all things, it's where the story strayed from the source material that it began to feel shaky. The latter half of this movie is not only a disgrace to Jane Austen's novel, but even of the direct source material, which, rather than taking the characters of Pride and Prejudice and dropping them in a Zombie Apocalypse (I mean that Literally - A (Suposedly)Biblical Apocalypse, except with zombies, simply sets the plot of the original novel in its entirety against the backdrop of a Zombie infested Regency England. The second half is when it really starts to fall apart. There are some aspects which were wholly unnecessary and go absolutely nowhere. One of the things that really annoys me about adaptations like this is that important characters from the second half of the story, such as Darcy's beloved sister Georgiana, are mentioned due to the use of canon dialogue early on, but are promptly forgotten. After Darcy's initial mention of her as being one of the few truly accomplished ladies of his acquaintance, other than a cameo in a flashback, she's never mentioned again, let alone seen. The name of Darcy's estate in Derbyshire, Pemberly, is never even mentioned.Personal issues with the film:In this Zombie Apocalypse re-imagining of Regency England, young people are sent by their families to study the martial arts of the Orient. Those of wealthy aristocratic families generally receive their training in Japan, while slightly lower class families receive training in China. There seems to be an implication that Mr. Bennett is wiser than other families in sending the girls to train in China as opposed to the flashier Japanese masters with their fancy katanas. I object to this view, as the bladed slicing weapons used in Japanese martial arts are probably more efficient for killing zombies than the straight bladed weapons, staffs and hand-to-hand combat practiced by the Shaolin.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

PPZ the book was a great connection between the original book and this story of zombies. The film unfortunately manged to lose that very quickly. It became Pride and Prejudice With the Occasional Zombie. The cast was dry with Lily James' Liz Bennett and a hilariously watchable Matt Smith being the standouts. Darcy was unattractive and creepy.

I can't really put my finger on it but the book works, The film doesn't. I think it has to do with how books are read. In the book the zombies just act to add a level of absurdity to a great, and well known, classic story. When watching the film I expect a zombie movie. It isn't. This is Pride and Prejudice. A drama of manners. So it just becomes a boring zombie movie. It's fun how traditionally zombie movies are about how civilisation is fragile. Very little is needed to turn us into monsters. Well... in this film nothing and no degree of apocalypse ruffle the feathers of the British upper classes. Even in the midst of a zombie apocalypse people are mostly preoccupied with saving face and social status. But not that fun. It does have a twist on the zombie genre that I like. That the zombies look like zombies before they themselves realise they're succumbing to the infection. So they behave normally not realizing how others see them. Eventually they go rabid. But points for trying. This is creative and they are taking risks. My hat off to them for that. The problem with taking risks is that it sometimes it fails.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

159,Phazed-101,A very unexpected and entertaining movie.,9,20 March 2016,"Genreally, I like zombie movies a lot because of their post- apocalyptic vibe.Normally though, I find the genre comes in 2 distinct flavours; serious stuff like ""28 Days/Weeks Later"" or campy B flavoured offerings like ""The Scouts Guide To The Apocalypse"".This movie however defies the genre. The closest comparisons I could make would be ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" or ""Penny Dreadful"" but with more humour. It follows the story of Pride and Prejudice so closely I kept looking for Keira Knightly to appear.The production quality however is what surprised me the most; it's incredibly high with great sets, realistic costumes, lighting and cinematography. There was a lot of attention to detail.This is a very unique and interesting mash-up which I quite enjoyed. I am surprised it's not rated higher on IMDb but I believe it deserves a watch regardless.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
160,yulia-pomarina,Either P&P or zombies,1,12 June 2016,"May contain spoilers.The film inevitably since the very beginning divides itself and fall apart into two unequal parts, one is about zombies, another is about Pride and prejudice. The part about zombies is better, it is original and easy. The part about P&P is pretty bad. The actors are not great in it. It is hard to say, what impacted on me to make such an impression. Maybe, just the topic (P&P) is so popular so you have seen many very good actor works so in such a comparison the actors of the present version lose. Maybe this is just not their cup of tea and they have just lack of talent. Maybe, the matter is in the very idea, either P&P or zombies and you must be an Oscar nominee to be able to keep such a self- dividing, self-breaking plot more or less integrate. The result is pretty unstable. The part about P&P is bad and worse. I marked 4 for zombies. They are the only convincing actors in the whole film. I praise computer graphic for it and good work of make-up artists. One else actress is OK with the topic rather. It is Lena Headey. And she is here also with a giant bodyguard. So she changed her hair colour from white to black, but she came from Game of thrones and it is noticeable. But the plot is lame here as well, when Mrs.Bennet tries to compliment Lady Cathrine (Lena Headey) I doubt that the answers from such a person would be so vegetarian. Lena Headey is a gem and must have better lines than that, so it is wasting of her participation here. You expect something really witty from the plot, but alas. If Jane Austen would write this part about zombies she would do it much better.So the film is not worthy of seeing at all.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
161,kevnbethp,Jane Austen fans need not be afraid,9,7 February 2016,"Jane Austen fans need not be afraid to see this movie! It was a delight-with much more focus on the Pride and Prejudice story than I expected or dared hope for. The zombies were almost a side story, rearing their ugly heads every once in awhile to be squashed in invigorating fight scenes where our Regency heroes and heroines were as scathing with swords as they typically are with word play. Elizabeth Bennet,admirably played by Lily James, was obviously cast for her Keira Knightley knock off looks. Darcy(Sam Riley) almost resembled a zombie himself with his pale shadowy under eye looks. The duo plays out a hilarious take on Darcy's awkward proposal scene. There is a surprising but interesting zombie oriented plot twist involving the scandalous Wickham that takes up the last quarter or so of the movie. Other than that deviation, I could've been watching a new BBC adaptation of my favorite story!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
162,lookingnewthings,Not Pride and Prejudice... Pride and Prejudice and ZOMBIES!,9,29 January 2017,"*** May Contain Spoilers*** I have to say, I'm surprised at such a low rating for this movie. That being said, I waited until it was on STARZ to watch it. I would also like to say that I had never read the Jane Austen book, nor watched any film adaptation of her book prior to seeing this movie. So, I went into this movie with no preconceived notions about what I thought it should be. I saw it for what it was, and nothing more. I also didn't expect much going into it.All that being said, I absolutely LOVE this movie! This movie had everything for someone that doesn't really take to romance stories. It had zombies. It had action. It had comedy. It had cringe worthy mortification. It had angst. It had romance. It had a bit of everything, that surprisingly worked well to bring a cohesive picture together and make an enjoyable fun movie for a Friday night with a bowl of popcorn.How do I even begin to say what I loved about this movie? I loved the interaction between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. I found their story more enjoyable to watch then even the zombie action. The interaction between these two actors was amazing. They had this incredible chemistry together on screen that I have rarely seen Lily James have with another co-star (Cinderella, anyone?). Sam Riley's portrayal of the silent, brooding Mr. Darcy was great. I'll hold any other actor to claim that role to his standard for the rest of my life. Their interactions made me laugh. I found them one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie. The first time Mr. Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, I was floored. I had no idea it was coming. Indeed, I had no idea that he had any feelings for her aside from contempt. And when she attacked him, I cracked up. It was perfect. Yet, after watching the movie a second time, I saw the subtle signs that said he was infatuated with her, that were easy to miss if you had no prior knowledge of the source material, such as the scene when he's in the garden at night hacking away at the hedges with his katana, because he's hopelessly in love with her, and she continues to confound him.I also love the zombie aspect of the movie. Every absurdity in their society, every absurdity in their interactions, is all overshadowed by the never ending cloud hanging over their heads that at any moment zombies could attack and ruin everything. It lends the whole story a sense of urgency that otherwise would just make some of the silliness in their interactions contrite.After watching this movie, I became curious as to its source material, so I read the actual book and watched a six-hour film adaptation of it done in the mid 90's. By comparison, I still prefer this version of the story. Why? Because the writer while keeping true to the story, and actually using many of the lines from the book written by Jane Austin for the dialogue of the movie, cut out all of the long flowery speeches that made the original dull, and often times ridiculous. How many pleasantries can you say before you get to the point of what you are saying? This movie cuts out all of the excess, unnecessary dialogue and just sticks to the point, drives the point home, and moves on to the next piece of the story. Simple storytelling. I like that.I would love to see a Director's Cut of this movie, that includes some of the aspects from the book that were rushed out of it, such as when Elizabeth is introduced to Mr. Darcy's sister, and the ""feud"" between Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for Mr. Darcy's attention. I think some of that added into this movie could lend it a bit more enjoyability, tell more of the story, and still keep the zombie action moving.If you can put aside any predisposed prejudices you have for the original source material, and just accept this movie for what it is, and not what you think it should be, then you will enjoy it immensely. If not, then you will hate it. This is not Pride and Prejudice. This is Pride and Prejudice and ZOMBIES.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
163,Ambre-G,Pride & Prejudice & Zombies : Review,9,21 April 2017,"SPOILERI loved this film, being a fan of Jane Austen, especially of Pride and Prejudice, Burr Steers made a fantastic adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's book. During the film I was amused to say the famous quotes along with the actors. The fact that there are zombies did not change anything, on the contrary that made the film even more hectic and intriguing.The combat scenes were very well choreographed, especially the one between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, in which one could see passion even though they were angry (except Darcy). The actors are fantastic, I loved Sam Riley in Malefic, Lily James in Cinderella and Douglas Booth in Romeo and Juliet.Burr Steers (Seth Grahame-Smith), demonstrated the strength of women in a historical context that are not conducive to this. Even though Lizzy has always been strong in character.I advise this film to all fans of pride and prejudice.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The acting is really good, plot was interesting, and even though it was cheesy, I would definitely watch again. It's a good movie to watch if you want to watch something weird and surreal.The plot worked much better than I expected it to, and as a Pride and Prejudice fan, I was pleasantly surprised at the way they blended the original story with zombies. I normally hate parody movies (seriously, never like them) so I am happy to say this is the first parody movie I legitimately enjoyed.If you want to watch a silly movie about romance and zombies that isn't warm bodies, then watch this. It has comedy, action, and a classic love story. Don't take it seriously, and enjoy!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
167,motleyalice,An excellent movie adaptation of a great novel.,9,16 February 2016,"Having read and enjoyed the book, I was dubious that the movie could live up to such a wonderful adaptation of a great classic. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I will say, for those who are fans of the novel (the adaptation or the original), this does not exactly stick to the storyline of the novel. In particular, the second half of the movie does differ significantly, so don't be surprised to find that you don't know exactly what is going to happen next.There were some parts of the novel missing that I had particularly enjoyed, but you can't have everything. The writers had put together a decent script which I think has surprised a lot of people. Yes, there are a lot of people out there who look down on genre films and that is their right to do so. I am sure that many who believe the only good book is one which is over a hundred years old will be horrified by the treatment of Austen's novel. My only comment on that is that it leaves more room in the cinema for those of us who not only love the classics, but also a good zombie novel.From my point of view, the actors did a good job of portraying characters blended by two authors plus screen writers. The film was beautifully shot throughout and although the story departs from the novel, it is entertaining. There is plenty of action throughout, as Elizabeth and her sisters prove that being female does not mean one has to sit back and wait to be rescued by a man. It means getting out there and killing zombies. That does not mean a woman is not open to the prospect of romance and marriage, merely that the man who falls in love with a woman like this is unlikely to be one who requires a demure wife.I didn't expect the cinema to be full - and it wasn't. We did get the fun of seeing a group of mid-teens watching the movie and apparently encountering Jane Austen for the first time. Watching their reactions to the Jane Austen parts of the movie was almost as entertaining as the movie itself. I can almost guarantee that at least half that group will be reading the original as well as the adaptation to see how they compare. Finally, before anyone complains that this is a film that men cannot relate to, I would point out that my action-film-fan husband came with me to the cinema and absolutely loved it. We have both seen more than one adaptation of Austen's original novel and haven't been over impressed; this was a refreshing change that made for an enjoyable afternoon out.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Don't waste your time on this, please.The plot can't stand on anything. I haven't read the book but I don't think is this bad. You simply can't do something serious of this kind of thing.

But this - this is deep below bad. How even somebody could make this movie? It was like that some guy came into the studio and said: ""Hey, let's take some classic novel and spice it up with lepers!"" And boss answered: ""Yeah! It's great idea!

176,johnkroper,Achieves exactly what it's going for,10,14 February 2016,"I feel compelled to write this review based on the bad reviews I've seen. If you are a fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and not a fan of zombie movies, please don't see this movie. If you're a fan of zombie movies but not of Pride and Prejudice, give it a chance and understand that the incorporation of zombies into the original storyline is well-achieved and hilarious. It helps to be a fan of both, but I don't fault you if you're not.It's important to have a sense of humor when going into most zombie movies. This is based on a best-selling novel of the same name, and I believe the movie does it justice. The story never falters: it's ultimately a romance wrapped in a zombie tale, or vice versa. The acting is superb, Matt Smith doing an excellently exaggerated version of the novel's counterpart. The setting and direction is excellent.For the zombie parts of the movie, it never departs from certain zombie canon. I won't give away elements, but a base for the depiction of zombies can be traced through the better zombie movies until this point.I don't expect people to see the movie through my eyes, but I really hope anyone who rated it actually saw the movie and gave it a chance rather than jumping to conclusions without seeing it. It is entertaining, I was invested in the characters, and the story never faltered. If you are reading reviews because you're on the fence based on the poor rating, please please please see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

Before I watched this movie, I thought that it would be a flop. How could you put zombies into a well-known, all-time love story? However, it turns out to be better than what I expected, much better actually. Before I watched this film, I had heard comments that the storyline does not make sense. However, I do think that the storyline follows quite closely to the one in Pride and Prejudice. It might be possible that the audience who has such thought has not read the Jane Austen's work. The zombies scenes are violence, but not too gruesome for my taste (which is great for me as I can't stand too much blood and gore in a movie).I would recommend this movie to those who want to read Pride and Prejudice, but are worried that it will be boring. The zombies will be there to keep you excited and awake.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
179,formygarbageonlineaccoun,I LOVED this movie....sort of,7,19 April 2016,"The only failing of this movie really....is that it is simply too short. It should have been a mini-series at least. The architecture of the mash-up was genius. You can't take that away from the movie or the book (which I did not read).What threw this movie off was the pacing. The aristocrat vs bourgeois love story narrative simply doesn't have time to develop under the pressure of random zombie disruptions. And that's all the zombies really represent. Disruptions. They unsettle the ""idyllic"" life of the idle rich, who's main concern is marrying up for social and economic mobility and making more money by increasing family fortunes.Which is the irony of the story, for those who don't get that. The essence of this story is basically the utter detachment from reality that the elite and wannabe elite, suffer from. It's the 1% ignoring the Occupy Wall Street 99% at Zuccotti Park...literally looking down their noses at the filthy masses. That is why this story is funny.Pride and Prejudice is fascism wrapped up in a love story. But we love fascism. Women absolutely adore fascism if they get to wear pretty dresses and go to the ball. Most want a rich man to elevate them out of the rank and file drudgery of life. They all want to be a princess. It's a very common theme in women's love stories.The problem with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is, that it just doesn't sell that idea very well due to the time constraint. It doesn't give the point of view of the zombies. I am assuming the book does. I don't know. If it did, we would have a more human face to the zombie struggle. It would be sad of the zombies were just some mindless antagonists. I'd have to think that the author by his very urge to create the mash-up would not have missed such an obvious rationale for creating the mash-up in the first place. This is the ONLY reason the contrast works!!!! This treatment was used by Simon Pegg way back in 2004's Shaun of the Dead parody. But in his version the zombies were used to examine the common man's detachment from reality. But both stories really examine man's detachment from man.Look, I love all the period dramas with the snobby leisure class lording it over the unwashed ""human capital"". But I also despise those people, which is hard to do when authors like Jane Austin romanticize them and gives them souls. What this story does, is that it shows how the rich have no souls, using zombies as a foil. In Shaun of the Dead there is some catharsis and realization about human connection. But I did not see that happen here as the ""connection"" angle which would have humanized the zombies turned out to be a zombie plot to fool the rich. So, that is unfortunate in terms of smart story telling and actually just rehashes old clichés of devious anarchists for the sake of action.In closing, from my perspective, the actors held up their end and did a great job with the tight clipped dialog which confined their ability to translate the emotional content of the scenes. So we lose some of that tension which revolves around money and status. But those that slam this movie aren't holding up their end by being actually educated about what this movie is really about. It is NOT about zombies. It's a blatant lampooning of the Upper Class!!!! At least I hope it is.The reason you don't see that, is because the main characters have been gifted with real talent and skills which implies that they have qualities OTHER than just inheriting money. If this universe were true to form, the elite would simply pay the poor to fight the zombies for them. In other words they would pay one half the poor to kill the other half of the poor. Which is how the rich have operated throughout the centuries, while hiding behind laws and religion that says God make people rich and here is the property law that protects that assertion.If you don't understand what I am saying....go ask a communist. They get it. Basically in all history a god, good fortune, and property law have operated as integrated human concepts that serve to keep rich people rich. It's a very cruel machine that creates progress.But when the feminine perspective clouds this truth about class warfare (literally expressed in this story) with love as the central theme, we are lulled into a pattern of lazy thinking. I refer to the litany of similar un-thinking critiques in this thread.Honestly, this movie and the book might actually be too smart for most people to understand. Which is really sad. Because it is so damn clever and really sticks it to the whole genre of money worship literature that women are addicted to. Jane Austin is ""Money Porn"". But most romance novels are basically money porn.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
180,hereislor,Surprisingly interesting,7,7 July 2016,"I wasn't so sure about watching this movie, like I wasn't sure about reading the book. I'm not quite a fan of things that involves zombies, or anything with the word 'zombie' on the title (that's not a comedy) But after a hard day and not really knowing what to watch this movie popped up in my mind and I say: why not? After all what am I losing? And I have to say that I'm surprised that I actually enjoyed the movie so much! Of course, it has the base on Pride and Prejudice (a movie and a novel that I love) but I was prepared to see it ripped apart by zombies in a really bad way well let me tell you that I was so wrong I'm ashamed! It has the perfect dose of weird romance, bizarre and funny (and zombies OF COURSE) stuff and a little bit of action that made the movie quite good, like a deceiver of the seven starts that I am giving to it. (In my opinion of course!!) It's like to see the old and well known characters from a classic novel in a ""modern"" topic, more like an alternative universe. And it was quite refreshing. About the actors well I like the way that every single one of them do their work, and seeing them in such characters as the ones from this movie was weird but fun. I can't believe that I am actually saying this because I had so much low expectations for this movie, but well, it changed my mind. It's a well recommended if you wanna have a moment to watch a hilarious movie and get away from the typical zombie movie, or from the typical 'a bit of romance' movie too.Happy that I gave this movie an opportunity.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
181,chuk99,Fun And Enjoyable,8,20 August 2016,"I considered giving this ten stars to help boost the low ratings, but decided to go with what it deserves. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (PPZ) is a fun film with good action and worth your time if you like to think out of the box.Seth Grahame-Smith's novel is an unusual mash-up of Jane Austen's original and the current obsession with the undead. When I read the novel, I thought it was amusing and original in its way, but it was a one-joke premise and quickly grew boring. The premise works better on film. PPZ (the film) has enough action and humor to keep one interested throughout. A couple things make this worth watching: Matt Smith's performance, which is hilarious and quite different from his Dr. Who persona, and shows his versatility; and How well they capture how society would change with a zombie outbreak in the early nineteenth century.The film wasn't perfect. For example, one thing that irked me was how Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet was thought to be plain, especially compared to her sister Jane, yet Lily James, who played the character is very attractive. That's typical of Hollywood casting, however, and if you can get past that, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is quite good.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The actors are magnificent and the argument stay hold to the original story, the origin of zombies it not only well explained but also is not abused and it stick with the drama perfectly.The scenes are beautiful, the costumes are gorgeous also the action scenes fit perfectly on the right time having the right length for it not being tedious or non sense.That post-credit just puts an awesome cliffhanger for a second movie that i will obviously going to watch.

184,sirocco-1,Totally enjoyable!,10,13 February 2016,"My film critic son went with me to see PPZ, the day Deadpool opened! And yes we will be seeing Deadpool soon enough. He totally enjoyed PPZ - why: because it's a mix of action, horror, humor and romance.Now the movie doesn't follow the book faithfully, but given that there like 6/7 different versions of P&P it's OK and yes I read the book - the book rocks by the way.No the movie starts with Darcy arriving at a home investigating that someone is affected with the living dead virus. Mr. Darcy is admirably played by Sam Riley, his voice, continence is what you would expect from a male who has been fighting zombies for most of his life.Lily James as Elizabeth - in the book she is the perfect warrior, when Darcy insults her at the Meryaton Ball she draws her knife out to slit his throat - after all it is a matter of honor - not so in the movie, she goes outside and weeps, just a little, but her warrior skills are very good as are her sisters.Bella Heathcote as Jane - the way she looks in the movie, well she could be Heather Grahams little sister and as the character Jane, she is a wonderful sweet older sister for Elizabeth, who knows how to dispatch zombies quite effectively.Another reviewer commented how good the movie is and I quite agree, if you want to see an entertaining movie with a smashing performance by Matt Smith as Mr. Collins (Dr. Who) after you see what movie you want - see this one. The audience was laughing, cringing and I even jumped a couple of points, that's how well done the movie was done - yes there are zombies that are as gory as one can imagine.And I should mention Jack Huston as Mr. Wickham - what a villain - no spoiler of him - you will have to see for yourself.Stay for the movie credits - it is quite an ending!What makes a good movie?

185,td_gwendy,Awesome expansion from the book!,9,8 February 2016,"I'm a big fan of the original Pride and Prejudice novel as well as the 1995 series and the 2005 movie. My husband bought me the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies book and I can't say the book was thoroughly enjoyable. So I wasn't expecting too much from the movie, but I was really blown away by how much and how well they expanded from the source material. This is one of the very few instances where I can say the movie is worlds better than the book. Wickham is a proper villain, the zombies are better placed as an integral part of the story instead of just a silly backdrop, the fight scenes are awesome, the zombie war more plausible if you will, and thank goodness they did away with a lot of the silliness like Wickham's weak sphincter muscles and the cauliflower heads (readers of the book will know). I also love the fact that they gave so many nods to all previous multimedia adaptations, from the original Jane Austen book, to PPZ, and even to the 1995 series and 2005 movie! With that said, the movie is far from perfect. It has editing flaws especially when one character is speaking yet the camera is not on them. There were also too many useless characters IMHO (I actually think they should have killed off some of the Bennet sisters) and a few plot holes but it can be overlooked. Over all, it's a very entertaining movie. For an unbiased opinion, it would have to come from my poor husband, who went with me solely to watch The Eleventh Doctor...I mean Matt Smith.

As others have stated, Matt Smith's portrayal was impeccable and perfect quirky! You can kind of tell that Lily James and he were together while filming as they didn't hide anything during their proposal scene.
My favorite scene of all though is the river/letter/tears scene. That is the scene that should have granted Lily James an Oscar nomination.
Okay. Plot holes...I know there are quite a few. The two that stick out for me are when Bennett is outside and Mrs. Featherstone approaches. She starts to tell her something then Darcy blows her head off! I keep thinking maybe it's about Wickham. I don't see him, but would it have been cool to see Wickham at one of the tables in that first scene?

189,ghk1857,Doesn't know what it is,4,11 February 2016,"I have no issue with the retelling of Austen's lovely story, in fact the idea is quite novel in itself. The problem is that the film doesn't know if it is a period drama, horror, fantasy, farce or action movie. Actually, it's a bit of all of those, but does not combine them well. Based on the classic bits, if this had been a straightforward retelling of the period drama/romance, it would have been superb. The film was very well cast, and really this film was wasted on their considerable acting skills. I particularly liked Mr. Bingley, Eliza Bennett and Jane Bennett, with the former two experienced in period drama. However, special mention must go to Sam Riley, whose portrayed a sensitive but tough Mr. Darcy and carried it superbly. Anyone who has to follow in the shoes of Colin Firth (as per the 1990's BBC TV production) has a hard act to follow. However, Mr. Riley has tremendous screen presence as well as a brooding look which suits the part. On the basis of what I saw, I reckon (if played as a straight drama) this cast and production would have been superior to the Keira Kinghtley movie version some years back. There are comic moments, and some mild-ish horror moments, however there are some moments of farce which undermine the rest. The plot, of course, is totally nuts. Entertaining enough I suppose, overall. Darned silly though! Keep the cast and remake it as a proper film of the book I say.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

The material itself never really deviated much from what one would expect from the story (or so I've been told after discussing the film with friends who actually know the background story), so there's that.I thought the movie didn't take itself too seriously and that helped convey a sense of amusement.

195,giselamichelle,Austen Revived,8,9 February 2016,"By adding zombies, Seth Grahame-Smith infused a classic romantic comedy with hand-to-hand combat and less misogyny, than Jane Austen could have imagined, in is his retelling of Pride and Prejudice, and Zombies. In a land of 19th century zombie apocalypse a woman could make her own way as a warrior, and not just a wife. Much like the original Mr. Bennet (played by Charles Dance), the PPZ Mr. Bennet encouraged his daughters to learn to think first, fight second and instilled a great devotion to their family. In the original telling the Bennet sisters (played by Lily James, Bella Heathcote, Ellie Bamber, Millie Brady and Suki Waterhouse) were raised to speak their mind and make their own way. The more ""practical"" Mrs. Bennet (played by Sally Phillips) made every attempt to have her daughters a part of ""normal"" society. Grahame-Smith's addition of a zombie apocalypse to the storyline, allowed for a leveling of the playing field for both men and women. A twist that I'd like to think Austen would have enjoyed.Austen's romantic comedies were a political commentary and ridiculed the issues women had with upbringing, education, marriage, and social standing. While PPZ keeps these issues at the forefront, the retelling is also able to add a flair of martial arts and 19th century tactical battle.Women, in Austen's time, were expected to marry into status, and men took for granted their standing to woo women who may otherwise not have a choice but to marry.Jane Austen's stories portrayed strong and intelligent women, but even the smartest woman in the 19th century was limited by the confines of society. Austen ridiculed the 19th century woman's dependence on marriage in her several works, which were originally published anonymously. Unknown by many, her comedic works were a satirical depiction of society.You can expect the dialogue of a 19th century novel, which some may not enjoy, but it is interwoven with energetic physical training, witty altercations, a storyline that pushes forward flawlessly. The ending will not surprise you, as it is clearly based on a 19th century novel, but the addition of zombies gives a delightful twist to the plot development. Jane Bennet, on her track to Mr. Bingfley's estate is not just caught in a storm, but is also attached by zombies. Her prowess in combat is shown, yet she still succumbs to the fever that allows Mr. Darcy to fall in love with Elizabeth.Every moment where the viewer might feel the story is slowing down with over developed dialogue and drama, as 19th century novels are want to do, this version of the telling fills the drone with hand-to-hand combat. If Austen could have imagined a world where women were warriors, as well as independent, she might have written this additional plot line. Austen's genre of choice was satiric romance, and Grahame-Smith takes the satire, adds violence and gives the audience fun quips, and great physical interactions.I won't say PPZ is for everyone, but if you've ever read or seen a 19th century romantic comedy and though, ""This story could use a lot less misogyny and a lot more violence"" then this movie is for you.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
196,rms-67486,Worthy Contribution,9,2 March 2016,"Pride & Prejudice & Zombies is an excellent overall contribution to the Zombie genre. It is exciting and refreshing to see director and cast surprise and delight watchers with an interesting twist. This film should join other impressive off-the-beaten-path films such as Exit Humanity, Wyrmwood, and A Little Bit Zombie as interesting and sometimes humorous journeys through a contextual world of Zombies. Too many critics lose sight of the context in which these films are created, judging them harshly on criteria that overlook the genius and creativity required to pull this off. The film has quirky acting,amusing dialogue, absurd violence, and interesting historical contexts.

199,WrappedUpInFilm,Crashed and burned!!,4,19 February 2016,"So obviously it's the Pride and Prejudice story that we all know, even some of the same dialogue, but with a twistthere are zombies randomly attacking.yes I know.Jane Austin and Zombies?Based on the 2009 novel by Seth Grahame-Smith.I thought this is either going to work and be hilarious or this is going to be a total crash and burnerI am sorry to say this was a crash, there was fire, and there were casualties.OK, before I get into all the negative lets start with a few positives.Cast! They all did a great job, I feel they did the absolute best with what they were given Of course, every Pride and Prejudice spin-off (even one with zombies) must have a Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy love story. This was actually done very well with Lilly James (from Downton Abby and Cinderella) and Sam Riley (From Control and Maleficent).Lilly James totally holds this film together. She's very captivating and sexy in this, I almost didn't recognise her with dark hair, very striking. She's an impressive actress and plays a great Miss Bennett.Another actor who stood out was Matt Smith (from Doctor Who) he was hilarious, had me laughing in my seat, a very camp and over the top performance – just great!Sally Phillips was very funny too, she makes a good Mrs Bennett Negatives:This just doesn't work! Isn't in any way scary or gory. It looked very naff. Didn't fit in. The story was pretty confusing. Very, very, predictable.Either have zombies and really go for it, black comedy style, make it funny or just don't have them and stick to the original story – this was just all over the place and a bit of a mess. They were playing it straight which just didn't work and was a bit cringe worthy. The Direction was OK, nothing special. I would rather watch a really good version of Pride and Prejudice or watch a really well done zombie flick. I just don't get the point of this movie! There are so many great books waiting to be made into films and they choose this drivel!! Honestly - I was really bored and couldn't wait for it to be over. If you're a Lilly James or a Matt Smith fan it's worth seeing this for their performances.I just hope it doesn't kick off a new zombie-adaptation trend, if it does I hope they do a better job!!Watch my review (and more) here: https://youtu.be/kFv90I4SaoU",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
200,anastasiachepurin,Yes my my Yesss,9,21 March 2016,"OK so first off I am a huuuge fan of Jane Austen and a lot of 1800 movies and the classics (being 18 XD i am pretty old school) Although I hate Zombies this movie WAS AN EXCEPTION, I truly LOVED it, watched it already 3 times.Although the trailer had me like ehhhh but after, now I recommend it to like all my friends. It has so much emotion and the fighting scene between Darcy and Elizabeth is funny, serious, yet romantic <3 Sams Raspy voice was strange at first but watching it round 2, totally grew on me. Liy James not only can be a sweet sweet princess in Cinderella but also a badaxx, I loved her way of showing emotion hate and love all at the same time!!! I hope to see the rating go up up up and PPZ 2 oh please please have a second one !!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
201,mthuctem,Great combination of the old and new,8,18 September 2016,"This movie is good, it's not silly at all. It has the look and feel of the original story from the novel, the clothes, the scenery, the way people talk and behave. The zombie thing is add in a clever way that I think it fit very well with the story. If you are just looking for good, entertaining, beautiful movie, and don't care about saving the original novel from creation, you will agree with me.I personally expected for more action scene from the girls. I was so anxious to see young beautiful girls in long dress fighting like soldiers when I saw the trailer. But those scenes in the movie are mostly in the dark, whyyyy?? And the plots sometimes does not connect to each other well. But in total, it's still a good movie and not waste your time to see.I want to give this movie 7 star but the average score of it at the present is too low, and this movie deserve better score so I will give it a bonus.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
202,ajak-77770,"If they had made us read this in high school, life would have been so much better",10,23 May 2016,"Waaaay back in the day, I had to read the original Pride & Prejudice for English class. Despite being a prolific reader, I hated it. I understood the language, I got the story, I got high marks on the relevant assignments, but damned if it wasn't one of the most boring things I have ever read at the time. Fast forward to 2009, when the book came out. When I saw Pride & Prejudice & Zombies at my local Chapters, I laughed. It was a funny idea, and I couldn't help but think to myself: why didn't we have something like that in high school? Never picked it up, and that was pretty much the last I had thought of it until the first preview of the movie came out.I will say, I have been looking forward to this one, just because I really did not know what to expect from a zombie apocalypse hitting 18th century England. And what I got was pleasantly surprised. On the plus side, the dialogue was well done, and very reminiscent of the original Pride & Prejudice. The story also followed along the same lines, but with the added benefit of zombies being shot and/or hacked apart at regular intervals. The subplot of the zombie plague also adds to the story between Darcy and Elizabeth. The take on the zombies is also a unique twist I liked as well, and one I don't think i've seen before. The setting itself was also well done. It looks like old England, and the places from the original novel, but at the same time, you can just tell something is very wrong. It really reminded me of the 1996 Romoe + Juliet movie that I did see in high school, and was far more interesting then the original play we had just finished reading in class.Not really much to say on the negative side for this one. The obvious one is that it takes a classic piece of literature and turns it on its head. However, unlike a certain other movie that involves a vampire-slaying president, this one makes no attempt to hide itself among the norm of the time, which helps it immensely in my opinion. But in the end, it is still somewhat classic literature, so I think this will be one that people will either love or hate based in part on their preferences.Overall, this is one definitely worth watching. It's serious, it's funny, it's fightey, and it's even mushy in a lovely-dovey way. And in a dead and decomposing one too. Very well done for what it is, and still retains enough of the original Jane Austen book that you could show this to your English students and they could learn something from it. Just make sure they read the original first.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
203,alastairdandy,"With a bit of effort, this could have been watchable",1,26 May 2016,"This film fails to deliver anything to recommend it.The script, a mash-up of half-remembered lines from other adaptations of Pride & Prejudice and forced, stilted dialogue which seemed to have been scribbled on-set before each take, was unconvincing and childish.The acting was static and emotionless - as if the first rehearsals were being filmed in single takes, using actors who either felt uncomfortable speaking the contrived lines or who had never acted before. The fault, here, must lie with the director. Why else would the talented Matt Smith be presented as if he were a simpering moron being given his first chance to perform in front of a camera?The audience is meant to think that the dimly lit sets were intended to create atmosphere but the real purpose of them was undoubtedly to disguise the poorly choreographed fight sequences and to save having to expend funds and effort on special effects.In seeking to create a possibly humorous and entertaining film by combining classic period drama with the current fetish for zombies, the producers of this woeful effort lost sight of both and made a film which stumbles along badly lit pathways, going nowhere, entertaining nobody and saying nothing.For any film to actually work, the audience needs to be engaged, to associate and sympathise with at least some of the characters. The script, the sets, the acting and the direction were so bad that engagement and a willing suspension of disbelief were impossible to achieve.Ultimately, it was boring.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

What can i say? in the end i almost wanted to get my money back. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most loved books in the world and the idea of mashing it with a zombie concept it could be fun. But, no, no...The plot of the movie was somehow subverted that i can't even call it a spoof, although a spoof would be infinitely better than this.Some performances are risible,Lena Headley's is almost not there, Mrs Bennet, big no no...

The acting and effects of the movie were beyond my expectations, and as far as the storyline, it was Pride and Prejudice. I love the book and movie Pride and Prejudice, I also love zombie movies so this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the zombie genre. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the characters. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I also must include that I almost didn't see this movie, because of the bad reviews. However, I am very glad that I didn't listen, because I feel like since this is a beloved classic book with zombies people may be upset that this movie was made in the first place.

Why they felt they needed to make up a story line with all the outstanding source material is beyond me. Notable issues: -Liz Bennet is known for her mirthful spirit. This LB scowled the entire way through the movie. Honestly, when she cried over Darcy at the beginning of the film instead of laughing off his snobbery I should have walked out then and there. -Lady Catherine represents the old guard of society. She would never accept any positives about Liz Bennet OR shelter her family (who are beneath her) -Since when could Lydia be considered anything other than a brat?

220,lgomidzelovic,Surprisingly entertaining,9,9 March 2016,"Pride and Prejudice is my favorite bookI have read it so many timesI have also loved BBC mini-series with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and 2005 movie with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. I absolutely hate zombie moviesvampires and even werewolves can be OK, but zombies? BIG NOPE! So when I first saw trailer for this movie, I was like: WTF, No!!! At first, I decided not to watch this movie, but after seeing more trailers, my curiosity prevailedI wanted to know what they did to my favorite love story. Let me tell you, I have been pleasantly surprisedeven with the zombies, I could enjoy the way story has been presented. The fight scenes are entertaining, Mr. Collins hilarious and odious as ever, and two main characters have really well on-screen chemistry. I must confess that unusual tone of Sam Riley's voice has sanded my nerves at first, but as story progressed, it became bearable and even added to character of Mr. Darcy. The unbelievably good fight between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, following his first proposal, left me on edge of my seathim diving into the lake reminded me of same scene with Colin Firth from BBC mini-series(really liked that and other little nods to previous adaptations and other Austin's booksI'm sure any fan of Austin's work and Pride and Prejudice will enjoy identifying them all). Being avid fan of Game of Thrones, I enjoyed seeing two Lannister's on board, Charles Dance as Mr. Bennett and Lena Headey as Lady Catherine De Burgh, can't decide which of two gave better acting. Lily James is absolute revelation as Elizabeth Bennet-action hero, given the fact that her Cinderella was at best shallow (and I really, really LOVE fairy-tales). All in all, this movie is not for everyone, but it is great mix of comedy, romance, action and some zombie slaying, so, in my humble opinion will be enjoyed by most of Pride and Prejudice fan's and maybe even inspire some lovers of zombie genre to read original book.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

They are the Others who are dangerous and we can't trust and, therefore, should destroy the last remaining bridge on the river so they can't enter the land(how about building a wall while you're at it?) The heroes are the ones who kill the sh** out of those dangerous Others and destroy the bridge while the guy proposing to live peacefully with the zombie community who are the seemingly peaceful ones turn out to be a secret zombie all along (Obama's secretly Muslim that's why he prefers diplomacy to bombing people?) And the last scene only reminds to mind that oh, you should have built that wall sooner! It was a horrible horrible experience to see this movie. I felt really bad after seeing it and I found other articles on the internet explaining the underlying racism of this movie. Anyway, if you don't feel the racism, then congratulations on your white American person!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
224,devildognc,Seriously Entertaining,7,24 March 2019,"If they had a break in the middle and said ""Are you not entertained?!"" I'd have had to say Heck Yeah! With no shame. For no logical reason whatsoever, I loved this movie.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
225,whitneyleahester,Loved it,10,31 August 2016,I absolutely loved this movie. It was a wonderful rendition of Pride and Prejudice with zombies thrown in the mix. I loved how different the characters had to be as well as how similar they needed to be for it to truly be a Pride and Prejudice movie. I loved the action. I found it very interesting how they incorporated zombies into this movie. It was done surprisingly well and it made total sense. I wasn't sure how they were going to be able to accomplish this but they did an outstanding job with it. The actors and actresses did a fabulous job with their characters and they all seemed to fit exactly. This movie was such a beautiful story that I hope they decide to make a sequel to see what happens with everyone.,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
226,seputarf,Adapted story from classic novel with horror and action scenes.,7,12 February 2016,"Actually this is an interesting premise. They combine classical romance story from novel with action and horror.But somehow these combinations ruins romantic moment. I cannot feel the climax of this movie. Everything is in the middle. Thriller atmosphere, suspense action, and romance chemistry are in the middle.The cast, Lily James doing a great effort for this.In overall, still amusing movie. Pardon the poor action scenes from the actress. They need to learn how to aim the gun or hold the sword.In the future, Burr Steers should do better version of this.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
227,jvmastandrea,This really is just garbage,4,14 February 2016,"I get that they did a nice job of incorporating pride and prejudice elements into the plot, but my goodness people. This movie is certainly undeserving of even 6 out of 10 stars. Please consider that I have a 4 star review, not a 1 star review. 4 is plenty for a film of this type.I thought the humor in it was terribly unfunny, the acting was meh, and most importantly, the plot was simply stupid. The only real points I can give was that the action was decent. If you are interested in his kind of film though, I just recommend waiting until it comes out to rent. Not worth ticket price.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
228,BillyBowAguirre,"Funny, Romantic and a Serious Movie",8,16 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and zombies(2016) what do I say about it? It is like seeing The Night of the Living Dead, meets Shaun of the Dead, meets Van Helsing and The original Pride and Prejudice.The women of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies where the strong women who learn to fight and kill the zombies. Most of the men in the movie were non fighters and they were a little bit scared of the zombies. Their was one man whose character was called Darcy. He was a zombie killer and fighter. Just like the original Pride and Prejudice. Darcy had pride in is heart and prejudiced towards Elizabeth Bennet and family. It parallels that same story line but just add zombies to the movie. It was a good plot and screenplay. Funny and witty and just full of life. Just like the original Pride and Prejudice. I give it 8 stars and I recommended it to everyone.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
229,n_sweda,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ and not for zombies,3,1 February 2016,It seems like somebody wanted to remake Pride and Prejudice but the focus groups said it didn't have enough support to get off the ground so they decided to add in a light smattering of zombies to get people in the door. Sure there's a few zombies here and there but the main focus in this movie is the love story which I have no idea how they expected us to take even remotely seriously with a backdrop of the undead. Also the love story itself was totally flat and unoriginal to boot so all I can really say is do yourself a favor and spend your time and money elsewhere. Well I have to write some more to fill 10 lines to submit my review so let me elaborate some more. You never develop an emotional attachment to any of the characters good or bad and (spoilers spoilers spoilers) also nothing bad ever happens to any of the main characters along with the plot being as predictable as an average game of tic tac toe.,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
230,luisbryan,Just telling my experience.,10,3 February 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is an amazing experience. It's thrilling, it's romantic, it's hilarious, and actioned pack!! I love love love this movie. The humor is depicted to the audience in a form that doesn't dumb down the dialogue. It's was brilliant and the cast was fluid. Extremely worth watching. The setting is perfect for the world our protagonist live in. The lore is tolerable. I personally distrust zombie movies however I enjoyed every second. Would recommend it to anyone looking to loose themselves in this wild piece of work. Truly a roller-coaster of fun. Please watch with an open mind and leave that pride and prejudice at home you zombie! #PPZ movie!!!!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
231,zac-27457,An OK movie,6,8 February 2016,"When I walked out of the theater I felt satisfied with this movie. It wasn't great by any means, but it was entertaining. The problem is that they tried to put so much material into a movie that the pacing was way off. It starts off fast with action then its a slow kind of boring crawl and then out of nowhere comes the big finish. More zombie killing scenes would've helped out a lot in the middle of the movie. A project like this would've been way better as a TV series on a premium channel. I hope they do a sequel to this movie because it looks like there will be potential for more action scenes. Hopefully when this comes to DVD there will be an Unrated/Uncut version that contains more zombie action that was left out to keep it at the PG-13 rating.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
232,turtelle,This movie is underrated. IT'S AWESOME.,10,10 February 2016,"I've seen the Pride and Prejudice 2005 movie and fell in love with it, I've watched it countless of times and got really excited to have learned about this new one plus there're ZOMBIES and I'm up for zombies.It's a really well made movie and it actually pains me to see this isn't being valued properly. The effects were beautiful, the actors were GREAT, and how it was written is good and Mr. Collins was.. well Mr. Collins. Anyway, I love the original story and was kinda afraid of how this movie would turn out but after watching it I never regretted a single second, It's just lovely! If I could, I would watch this again.I wish it could've lasted longer!!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
233,russell-35398,Jane Austen and zombies -- it's a no-brainer!,7,12 February 2016,"This is a film that can't be faulted under the Trades Description Act – you want Jane Austen and the walking dead? It's a no-brainer! Well actually it's a lot-of-brains-er because it turns into a proper gore- fest at times, so fans of the genre won't go unrewarded.However unlike the lumbering, slow American zombies we've got used to in the likes of The Walking Dead and Z Nation, these early 19th century ones are quite benign until they've had their first taste of human brain and often go unsuspected in polite society. But once they've had those brains, they're fast and furious and there's no stopping them – apart from the Benet sisters and Mr (here promoted to Colonel) Darcy (Sam Riley). The Bennets – Elizabeth (Lily James), Jane (Bella Heathcote), Lydia (Ellie Bamber) Mary (Millie Brady) and Kitty (Suki Waterhouse) – are Shaolin-trained warriors, experts at fighting the zombie menace with knives and pistols hidden under their petticoats. But, as the film puts it, ""zombies or no zombies, all women must think of marriage,"" and so the story follows the familiar paces of Austen's 1813 novel, interrupted by zombie attacks and a lot of blood now and again.The good thing about the film is that everything is taken very seriously, although tongue in cheek, and there are parts of it that are very funny, in a gory kind of way. Lily James makes a fine action hero, as does Sam Riley, though his growling voice becomes a bit tiresome. And former Dr Who Matt Smith almost steals the show with a superb comic turn as the simpering stick-in-the-mud Parson Collins.Dedicated Jane Austen fans may not like it too much. But if you can stand the gore, everyone else definitely will.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
234,ldsebastianflyte,Spoiler free: Discounted Classic Lost in Zombieland and Missing the Point,6,13 February 2016,"Just got back from Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and all I can say is, they missed the point, at least half the point and the more important half, which was Pride and Prejudice.Entertaining the audience with an obvious lavishing budget, PPZ could have been taken seriously as a retelling of a classic tale. Costumes were thoughtfully designed, plenty of extras hired with beautiful sets, it would almost seem that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was of the same rank as the 2005 feature Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley. This zombie infested flake, however, has proved itself to be a discounted classic with a poor man's Keira Knightley, Lily James.Tonally PPZ suffered a great deal of uncertainty as it struggled between being a full blown comedy or a serious classic with a popular cult twist (which could well be rather serious as well). Indeed there have been some moderately comic lines and characters with some mildly nifty shenanigans, it wasn't quite a real comedy nor was it remotely worthy of being taken seriously with the handling of the plot, character and emotions, which by the way should have been the heart of the classic, and also the half-hearted delivery of the timid and iconic moments.It felt like as though the screenwriters were tired of the Jane Austen tale, all the lines that felt introspective, romantic or character building were delivered in the least interesting and superfluous manner possible, not to mention the reservedness of the olden days being half way absent.Going back to the biggest miss of the movie, the handling of the original tale was rushed and sloppy, squandering every acting opportunity for the rising starlet and Mr Sam Riley, they simply read their lines especially with the latter. PPZ should not be surprised by an audience looking for much more than slick action sequences and generic zombies after all, it was the Jane Austen timeless piece in the title, with a storyline that fascinated generations of readers and audience. In PPZ however, it's a bit harder for the audience to relate to the characters and to feel the pride and the prejudice. In fact if one doesn't know of the classic novel, the plot would seem rather forced, which means one thing: someone's being lazy here.Moving on to the actors, although having Keira Knightley's eyes and lips and even her grin, Lily James unfortunately was not given Keira's jawline nor her exquisite nose, which was allegedly a work of surgeons... but mostly importantly, her acting skills were consistently eclipsed by the former, further confirmed in this discounted movie with herself playing the same but discounted character. From Cinderella, the movie star that made herself an international household name more or less, to PPZ, her acting continued to lack depth, in the sense that it looked real to the eye, skillful but somehow soullessly wrapped with inoffensiveness, unlike Knightley in the 2005 film, which was rather engaging emotionally with the convoluted journey to true love. Lily James delivered her forte of inoffensiveness yet again in PPZ, too perfect or too bland perhaps.Poor Mr Darcy was miscast all along with Sam Riley, the mouth breathing actor with the voice of a raven. The eyes might be piercing, but the semi shut mouth (like Kirsten Stewart) hinting to his tiny yellow teeth certainly was distracting. With a barely vocal voice and a face as still as a statue, sadly there was hardly any acting capacity. Studios will find out whether Riley is leading man material soon enough especially after this flake.Matt Smith handled his Mr Collins with a fully comedic approach, which seemed out of place with the rest of the movie while Mrs Bennett played by Sally Phillips lost much of her paranoid and petty comic charm. On the bright side, Jane Bennett and Mr Bingley were aptly cast with the celestial Bella Heathcote and the irresistible Douglas Booth.As a final note, the pride and prejudice in the characters were just as soulless as the zombies while many peripheral characters were reduced into cameos appearances, lacking any significance, relevance or development, especially Charlotte. Sprinkled with loose ends here and there, there were times when these supposed cues in the plot would turn out to not be leading to anything, such as the 4 riders and the undelivered message. PPZ, in the end, wasn't quite an action movie nor was it a real romance and certainly not enough to be a comedy, it didn't really know what it was except from capitalising on the mashup idea of juxtaposing a modern trend with a literature classic, which was quite brilliant to be fair.Let's face it, PPZ only got the zombie part right because the soul in the original Pride and Prejudice is missing. Looking pretty with nice costumes, sets, slick moves and prosthetic makeup is not going to save you.Oh I almost forgot, the music was okay by the way, sadly I really don't remember much of it...",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
235,suemilani,I loved the romance in this movie,9,14 February 2016,"I have to start off by saying that I am a big Jane Austen fan, and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of her books. I love the romance in her books. So I went to this movie just wanting to see how the romance was managed, and didn't care so much about the zombies. In fact, I was glad to see it wasn't too gory (with a PG13 rating it probably couldn't be anyway). The worst were the heads getting blown off.I wasn't disappointed. I believe that Lily James and Sam Riley were very good and quite believable in the parts of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Matt Smith as Parson Collins was extremely funny, and the other characters were done well, though Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) was nicer than as portrayed in the book.This is an alternate universe, so the characters have to be different, too. Lizzie Bennett was taught to be a warrior, so her womanly skills are awkward, and she knows it. Mr. Darcy was taught to be a gentleman, who just happens to also learn how to be a warrior. I think that Lily James shows both Lizzie's vulnerability and her strength. Sam Riley shows Darcy being very haughty, hiding his thoughts behind a calm facade, but who wields his blade mercilessly. I am definitely not someone who knows martial arts, but what I saw was good. Whether it was true to what martial arts should look like, I have no idea. I found it made sense for the movie, and that's all I cared about, not whether the moves were ""real"" or not. Movies are art, are they not? And art is in the eye of the beholder.The verbal skirmishes between Lizzie and Darcy are great. I think Lizzie's set downs are wonderful and she comes out on top each time, putting Darcy in his place. The first proposal scene between Darcy and Lizzie is quite fun. In Jane Austen's time, feelings had to be internalized, not shown, and if verbalized, in a nice way. But in this zombies time, Lizzie is allowed to be physical in her response to Darcy's proposal (which is all about HIM and what he had to overcome), and I loved the fight that erupts. For the second proposal later in the movie, you see how Darcy has changed because the words are spoken from the heart and it is all about HER. My romantic heart had a big sigh over what Darcy says. I also noticed that there are a few quick quotes from other Jane Austen books thrown in, one from Northanger Abbey (a paraphrase of if a girl can't find adventure at home she has to seek it out), and one from Persuasion (half agony/half hope). There might be others that I missed since I got caught up in the action. I must admit that I do not understand the very last scene, shown during the credits. Is it a lead-in to a possible sequel, or does it mean something else even more horrible?So I got the romance that I wanted and came away quite happy. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because, even though I liked it a lot, I felt there were some scenes missing. I really wanted to see Lizzie and Darcy dancing at Netherfield, and more verbal sparring. Maybe the DVD will have deleted scenes. :)",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
236,vampgirl-78885,MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!! Better then original Pride and Prejudice!! In LOVE!!,10,10 May 2016,"OMG BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES!!!!!! This is a must watch movie, I have watched it at least 6 times and I don't care If I already know what's going to happen next! I never get tired of it EVER! The actors did a wonderful job. And I am a person who loves romance movies and action movies now if u combined the two and equal them out then I am hooked on the movie. I just think it was well done, the romance bloomed to the fullest and the action the fighting was just brought out and mixed with the romance and really it's almost better, no wait it is better then the original Pride and Prejudice. Loved it Loved it Loved it!!!!! MUST SEE MOVIE!!!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
237,cortniebuckner,best movie!,9,20 May 2016,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: the movie that makes you jump You may think you know pride and prejudice (the original story) but do you know it with dead people?!? Yes there are of course zombies. It's the same story line as the original movie/book but it has a twist. SPOILER ALERT there trying to kill the zombies the whole movie. It's a great movie lots of action and a little bit of romance. I would not recommend this to little kids there are several spots in the movie that make you jump. And there is a lot of blood and gore. There was a two year old sitting behind me and my friend in the movie theater! Why would you bring your two year old to a movie with zombies in it? She didn't cry but still. There wasn't anything inappropriate there was blood, gore and some violence but not any sex scenes or anything that inappropriate. But it isn't appropriate for little kids (stupid lady sitting behind me). I really liked this movie it put a twist on the original movie/book but still kept the same story. The same story was still in the movie they just added zombies in the movie to make it seem better (in my point of view).I've been into romance lately and it quite a bit of romance and some kissing. It was the perfect length not to long not to short. It was a perfect length because it didn't go over 2 and ⅕ hours and it wasn't under that. The romance was perfect for this movie. It made it more interesting and great. There wasn't anything negative or that I didn't like about this movie. Some people have said they hated it or it was the worst movie they ever seen. They just don't really like the movie because it was boring but I disagree. It was very entertaining and exciting for me. I had to go to the bathroom during the movie but I didn't want to miss anything. It was so good. I would go back any day and see it again. It's worth it!There were several love scenes like romantic love scenes. I think that was the best part of the whole movie. There is a scene where the 2 main characters (Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy) almost die and the main girls starts kissing the main guy to wake him up and start crying cause she is scared she won't wake up. Romance scenes are so good cause the way it is it's just so good and watching the scenes makes me want to be like them. It was very entertaining. I gave this movie a ⅘ stars over all it was a very good movie and couldn't have been any better. It had a great story line and amazing characters.The story line is great because of the romance and the action. The characters are so good because they act so good. Most people who try acting always end up sucking at it. Not to mention the main boy is a freaking babe! I really love romance and I'm not a big fan of action but it worked for this movie",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
238,stevehaude,Fun on all levels!,9,21 May 2016,"I saw a lot of reviews from Jane Austen fans who were doubtful about being able to enjoy a zombie version of her stories, but were pleasantly surprised to find it quite enjoyable. I reached the same conclusion, but from the other direction! As a certified (certifiable?) zombie fanatic, I watch every zombie movie that comes out. I was extremely dubious about a zombie movie saddled with Jane Austen / Downton Abbey-type characters. But I dutifully sat down to watch it, with the expectation of probably not making it to the end. Wow, was I wrong! This movie works on all levels! It's fun, period. The zombies are adequate to keep the zombie fan in me interested, but I was delighted to find myself sucked into the silly, hyper-formal British melodramatic schtick. (With clenched characters who always look like they're not sure if they just smelled a fart.) I'll admit that I even got caught up enough to find myself saying things like ""No! She can't marry this guy, she should marry THAT guy!"" Which made me laugh at myself and feel like I was part of the fun, in on the joke. And the whole cast and crew were clearly in on the joke, and must have had a marvelous time making this picture. It was clearly a labor of love. The young ladies are fetching to say the least, beautiful and deadly but still vulnerable and human. The villains range from clownish to everything you'd want in a villain. The chemistry between the cast is obvious, and the comedy is well-written and delivered pitch-perfectly. I wish in retrospect that I had watched this movie with my wife, who would have been coming from the Jane Austen side of things, so that we could meet in the middle and have a fantastic time together. I may still watch it with her anyway, since I expect this movie to offer excellent re-watchability value. I signed up at IMDb specifically to write a review of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. And this being my first review, I gave it only 9/10 so I won't permanently skew my ratings. I suppose there are other movies that I do like better, but not by a heck of a lot. This movie shouldn't disappoint anyone, whether you're a Jane Austen fan or a zombie fan or neither. If you like engaging characters, clever comedy delivered with gusto, a movie that knows when and how to laugh at itself, and which will sometimes make you want to stand up and cheer, then I highly recommend Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. This is the kind of movie that, if you see it in a theater, people applaud at the end. Or at least I would.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
239,ward_rivers,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It's the only Pride & Prejudice I saw or read to the very end.,10,4 June 2016,"I'm so regretting not seeing this movie in the Theater. The acting and effects of the movie were beyond my expectations, and as far as the story line, it was true to Pride and Prejudice(what I got from clif notes and parts of movies). I love a good Love story as well as action movies with martial arts and I like zombie movies. So this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the zombie genre and Pride & Prejudice. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the characters. Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy was handsome, out spoken, and the perfect amount of sexy warrior. The anx of seduction between Lily James and Sam was both heart wrenching and beautiful. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I am so horrified by the bad reviews the movie received, surely those viewers must have seen a different movie then I. I know it was great because I cried when I thought Darcy was dead, and cried again when he proposed again at the end. I hope to see the sequel produced ""Mr Darcy takes a wife and Zombies"" even given the bad reviews. I think P&PZ will do well around the world and on DVD/Bluray and other streaming deliveries. I'd hate to think I'm not going to find out what happened on Liz's and Darcy's wedding night Zombie Apocalypse.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

What's better then Victorian style dressed woman killing zombies with swords.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
241,davidpaine-78208,How can you not love this movie?,9,28 August 2016,"Jane Austen would approve. The movie mixes the best elements of the book and adds the hysterical premise that England is under attack by zombies. In addition to her own personal pride, Liza Bennet has the warrior code to buttress her ego against Darcy's insults. Their kung-fu battle is one of the best scenes in the movie. A fantastic juxtaposition of martial arts and the Victorian battle of wits. I also read the Seth Grahme-Smith that inspired this movie. It was tremendous fun, more faithful to the original book and of course, there was more to the story. The movie changes the second half of the story quite a bit, in particular as regards George Willowby. Anyone who takes offense at playing around with the sacred text and the immortal Jane Austen, should know this is not a cheap take, but a fully tongue in cheek variation. A good time should be had by all!",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
242,driftpanda,This is a great movie - but perhaps people expected something different?,10,20 June 2016,"In brief, I think the critical response to this movie must be due to people expecting something different. In my opinion I think this is well scripted, well acted, well directed as well as being visually iconic with a great soundtrack. The plot's good, it avoids a lot of tropes, so why the low rating? Well, I think everyone must have expected this to be a big guffaw, an ongoing joke like Zombieland (decent enough), or your average teen movie (terrible). Except what they got was a proper, sound, decent movie. No laugh track or quirky punchlines, just a balance of renaissance dialect, beautiful settings and good ol' fashioned zombie action. The romance plot is (as expected) very good too.Maybe a movie with a plot was just too darned complicated for an audience that expected explosion-kicks and zombie-head footballs? Or too improper for Jane Austen fans? All I know is it was a lot more creative, unpredictable, well visualised and well executed than most zombie, action or even young adult movies I've seen in years.So maybe ask yourself what you're expecting from this movie - put that aside, and enjoy it for the great movie it is.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

I love so many adaptations of Jane Austen's work, but this one was terrible! The hilarious thing about the zombie adaptation was that it stuck pretty well to the original story. This was just a random, terrible zombie movie, with some well-known characters shoehorned into roles that were not at all consistent with how Jane Austen wrote them. If they were going to rip the entire story apart, they may have well just made a generic zombie movie. The book included fights with ninjas, Wickham getting maimed, and absolutely none of that made it into the movie. Instead, they invented some random plot that was not thought out well, and just muddled the entire story.

245,Smerlymunst,A really pleasant surprise!,9,19 September 2018,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that if you are a huge fan of the zombie genre or Pride and Prejudice, you are going to look on this film with disgust and horror!As a huge fan of the book of Pride and Prejudice as well as the BBC 1995 adaptation, I didn't really enjoy the Kiera Knightly version. The actors weren't the same, Darcy wasn't the same, there was no lake and it was just too short to fit the whole book into a couple of hours of screen time. So you can imagine my dismay when I heard about a film called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies! Added to this, I am also a huge zombie fan - World War Z (book AND film fan), Walking Dead, Shaun of the Dead - I love zombie apocalypses! As much as I love both genres, I was dubious to say the least about a crossover between a Regency period love story and zombies.My husband watched the trailer recently (I had disdainfully disregarded any thought of watching the film by this point) and said it looked well worth watching. As he seemed to be keen I grudgingly thought I would give it a go. I am so glad that I did!This film works in a way I never thought it would. Yes, there are zombies in Regency England. Yes, there isn't endless blood and gore as is usual with Zombie movies. But there is much more to this film than blood and guts. It's not stupid as I thought it would be. There is humour, love, a certain amount of creepiness, gender equality, class equality, - a zombie doesn't care if you're a man, woman, rich or poor; they're going to gobble up your brains regardless!It gives us a new breed of zombies - ones with brains that evolve (or devolve?) over time into something more and more dangerous. Fascinating idea.The casting was superb, however Matt Smith's Mr Collins was the best -he stole each of the scenes he was in and was hilariously funny but not to the point of slapstick humour. Just brilliant.The relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth was well portrayed and very, very touching. I almost preferred this Darcy and Elizabeth to the originals! The declaration of love at the end.... Well, there is many a romance film which could learn something from this.I could go on and on but I won't. I enjoyed it so much that, if it had been a 6 part mini-series which fully fleshed out the story, it would probably have earnt 10/10. As it is, I am giving it 9/10 - well worth seeing and I'll definitely be watching it again.",Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
