0,SnoopyStyle,stripped down performance,8,18 August 2015,"It's 1995. Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) hikes the Pacific Crest Trail. She's a novice with an overweight pack and undersized boots. As she hikes, she's dealing with her personal demons and troubled past. Her father was a violent drunk. Her mother (Laura Dern) raised her and her brother after leaving him. Cheryl is shattered when she dies. She became a drug addict and detached. Her marriage to Paul (Thomas Sadoski) ended but he continues to be supportive.Some may complain about the lack of a thrilling drama. That's not really the point especially if it has to stay true to her journey. It's a character study and has to judged on that level. Reese Witherspoon is doing more than stripping off the makeup. She delivers a real sense of grief and a live breathing person. Director Jean-Marc Vallée lets the performance be and not crowd it with too much. One does feel like being on the hike with her.",Wild
1,Hitchcoc,"Yes It's Clichéd, But the Performance Is Quite a Tour de Force",8,13 January 2015,"This is the story of Cheryl Strayed who made a trip on the Pacific trail, over a thousand yards. Reese Witherspoon is Strayed and she has been through it. If we were to look at her upbringing that leads her to this decision, we would find a broken person who has fallen under the truck, time after time. As she faces each challenge (being really unprepared for the trip, reading manuals for devices and obstacles on the way) she has flashbacks of her long suffering mother (played by Laura Dern). The mother's death led her to the lowest of the low, drugs, alcohol, promiscuity, and even pregnancy. But her mother was the rock, never faltering when things became horrible. Just as her life was looking up, she contracts spinal cancer and dies quickly. Strayed meets all the challenges and grows tremendously along the way. There are threats around every corner and she expresses her fears and concerns at every juncture. At one point, a couple of bow hunters get assistance from her, but their threatening presence is incredibly intense. She is rightfully afraid, but manages to keep her feet under her. She often has feet of clay, but she manages to somehow avoid defeat. Acting performances are good across the board, but at times seem contrived. Still it's a very good character study.",Wild
2,Prismark10,A walk on the wild side,3,30 May 2015,"I once drove the Pacific Coast Highway over several days and felt that was a big undertaking so walking the Pacific Coast Trail which is over a 1100 miles feels like a massive undertaking.Nick Hornby adapts Cheryl Strayed's memoir who embarks on this hiking adventure with little training and plenty of quick flashbacks fleshing out her multitude of problems which includes the loss of her mother, drug addiction, casual sex and the breakup of her marriage.Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl and to be fair sketches out the character as someone who has led a wild and destructive life, caused pain to her husband and determined to finish this trek which at times seem frightening and dangerous, especially as most men she encounters on her walk tend to appear predatory.The film is however vapid and messy with the constant flashbacks. There is some nice scenery of the PCT but the film suddenly ends with a voice-over but we are no better in knowing how far Cheryl has really gone in her personal journey. I kind of felt that I never really engaged with the film.Reese Witherspoon gives a brave performance who now she is older feels the need to push herself and not play safe like she did in roles such as Legally Blonde.",Wild
3,nogodnomasters,FIND YOUR BEST SELF,10,30 November 2018,"Cheryl Grey/Strayed is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. While being a farm girl, she knows nothing about hiking and camping, making many mistakes. She makes friends along the trail to help her. The reason for her journey is to become reborn. She wants to become the person her mother raised and expected her to be. The film has numerous flashbacks to her past, her mother's death, her marriage, her heroin use, her infidelities, and family. She remembers the good and the bad, life's pain and frustrations. Cheryl is educated and leaves poems and quotes along the way in the hiking journals, becoming the ""Queen of the PCT.""It is a story about starting anew and seeking redemption.Reese gives us a great performance. Her rediscovery is not based in religion. She develops her own philosophy along the way, her own goals, and learns the value of having shoes that fit. A film with a few hidden metaphors. I felt the film was geared more toward women then men, but enjoyable nonetheless.Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, nudity (Reese Witherspoon).",Wild
4,kosmasp,Into the big trip,7,16 September 2015,"Let's start with Reese Witherspoon. She really shows off her acting chops in this one and finally gets a role that does require her to actually act (instead of some of those lighter roles in comedies that are not that demanding or ambitious even). And she delivers on a high note. Still if you try to compare it with Into the Wild, this will always lose in comparison, so better leave that out of the equation.This actually is based on a true story and a book. Unfortunately and this is the ""bad"" side if you will of the movie, this is not as engaging as the performance of Reese would suggest and actually deserve. It's more than decent and the trip she is taking is of a big magnitude (which is why this was called ""Big Trip"" in German/Germany). Still it seems to be missing an ingredient to make it to the top of the everest so to speak. A nice road/walk trip movie, that has enough drama to keep you on the edge of your seat though",Wild
5,gavin6942,An Unsympathetic Heroine,7,25 January 2015,"A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent catastrophe.Is this a bad film? No. But it is not a great one, either. Reese Witherspoon, who has gone the extra mile in ""Mud"" and ""Walk the Line"" puts out a solid performance here, but is it Oscar-worthy? No. And Laura Dern's supporting actress nomination? Dern is great, but that slot was meant for Jessica Chastain.The biggest thing with the film as a whole is just how little the audience cares about the lead, the ""Queen of the PCT"". We see her as a woman who will sleep with anyone (and everyone) and had a drug problem. This is apparently excused because her mother died, which is absolute nonsense.Had we focused more on the hike and the dangers therein, and less on the flashbacks, Cheryl Strayed might have been someone to admire. Here she just seems like nobody special, nobody worth our concern.",Wild
6,lee_eisenberg,I almost appeared as an extra in this movie,8,10 May 2015,"I had never heard of Cheryl Strayed's story until I heard that ""Wild"" was getting released. While it's true that the self-discovery genre has gotten overused, this movie goes the extra step by opening with something that made me squirm. Reese Witherspoon plays a decidedly unglamorous role as the bereaved Cheryl, hiking up the 1,100-mile Pacific Coast Trail. Encounters with animals, inconvenient weather and terrain, and a festival commemorating Jerry Garcia make this a trip like no other. It's as though she's starting a new life with this trek.I hope to see more movies like this, and I hope that Reese Witherspoon sticks more to serious roles. There are too many untold stories to keep making superhero movies. Adding good support is Laura Dern as Cheryl's deceased mother (seen in flashbacks). Definitely worth seeing. After this movie and ""Dallas Buyers Club"", I'm so far impressed with Jean-Marc Vallée as a director.As for my near appearance, I'm a member of a group that finds people to be extras for productions filmed in my urban area. I was up for an appearance in ""Wild"" but didn't get chosen.",Wild
7,jboothmillard,Wild,6,24 January 2015,"I first heard about this film when I found out the leading star was nominated Best Actress, then I heard about the plot line and that it was based on fact, so I was definitely up for seeing how it would be, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée (The Young Victoria, Dallas Buyers Club). Based on the true story, set in 1995, Cheryl Strayed (Oscar, BAFTA and Oscar nominated Reese Witherspoon) has ended her marriage with husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski) after their relationship broke down, her mother Barbara ""Bobbi"" (Oscar nominated Laura Dern) died, and she had years filled with reckless, self-destructive behaviour, with all hope lost she makes a rash decision to get away from everything. With absolutely no experience, only driven by sheer determination to finish, Cheryl stocks up a backpack with camping equipment for a long trip, she plans to hike the 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. During the journey the film has many flashbacks going back to Cheryl's life during childhood and as a teenager, the events that lead to the breakdown of her marriage, the death of her mother and her drug abuse and frequent sex with many men. Cheryl's hike is seen in chronological order, along the journey she occasionally comes into contact with fellow hikers and people driving near to the route, she gains serious injuries and suffers great pain during it, but in the end Cheryl rediscovers and heals herself, finding newfound strength and resolution. Also starring Keene McRae as Leif, Michiel Huisman as Jonathan, Lost's W. Earl Brown as Frank, Gaby Hoffmann as Aimee, Kevin Rankin as Greg, Brian Van Holt as Ranger and the real Cheryl Strayed makes a cameo as the Woman in a Truck. Witherspoon gives a very good performance as the real life woman who goes against the odds, experiencing terror, near-madness, pain and pleasure during a long journey of self-discovery, in the flashback scenes Dern is also good as her mother, the mix of non-linear flashbacks and the chronological hiking is mixed in places, the hiking is ultimately what you pay attention to most, but you absolutely root for the leading character to finish her journey, all in all it is an interesting biographical drama. Good!",Wild
8,Tweekums,The inspiring story of one woman's long walk,8,18 June 2020,"This film tells the story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman who walked 1100 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mexican border in the south to the Columbia River on the border between Oregon and Washingtin in the north despite having no hiking experience. Interspersed with scenes of her journey we see, via flashbacks, how her life fell apart following the death of her mother and the collapse of her marriage leading to behaviour that was probably as dangerous as hiking the PCT without being properly prepared.I really enjoyed this film; particularly the scenes of the trek. Normally commenting on the scenery before the story is a sign that something is lacking in the latter but here it is a vital part of the film... I doubt the trail would exist if it wasn't scenic. Reese Witherspoon gives a fine performance as Cheryl Strayed making it easy to believe her character is having a tough time but also is developing as the journey unfolds. In early scenes it would be hard to believe she didn't just die in the Mojave if one didn't know it is based on a real person's experiences but by the end it doesn't feel unlikely that she makes it. The flashback scenes nicely show what led somebody with no experience to try such an arduous walk. Laura Dern provides solid support as Cheryl's mother in the flashback scenes. The story provides plenty of tense moments, as terrain, weather and certain people she meets provide possible threat. Overall I'd certainly recommend this.",Wild
9,tavm,Wild was an excellent depiction of Cheryl Strayed's hiking journey and her pain in reliving her past during that,10,16 July 2015,"Just watched this movie with Mom on a Netflix disc. We both were intrigued with the journey taken by this Cheryl Strayed. Reese Witherspoon does well in playing this woman whose flaws is revealed for all to see but also her determination to make her hiking journey truly worth something especially when she thinks back to all her she's done before her mother's tragic death. Laura Dern is also fine as her mother. Those flashbacks really do provide insight into what Cheryl experiences when taking this rough journey. The most chilling scene was when that one male hiker was sexually harassing her. There were a couple of humorous scenes that I also liked. So on that note, I highly recommend Wild.",Wild
10,edwagreen,**1/2,6,10 September 2015,"A recently divorced woman goes hiking to lose herself, evaluate a life where she had an alcoholic father, and a mother who died a month after a diagnosis was made.This is virtually a story of reawakening, and while thinking of the past, our Reese Witherspoon encounters a variety of people with different philosophies along the way.I found the film depressing and would skip through her rather lengthy hikes.Laura Dern does a good job as the mother, resuming college before tragedy strikes.Could have been a sad commentary on life before Witherspoon finds herself.",Wild
11,michaelRokeefe,A desperate woman on a life changing trek.,7,28 May 2015,"Chick flick? Not exactly. And I'm not afraid to say I like it. I've always been a Reese Witherspoon fan; and yes, she had a lot to do with me watching WILD. A broken marriage that finally came undone and her mother's death leads Cheryl Strayed(Witherspoon)on a years-long reckless bout of bad behavior, fueled by loneliness, addiction and despair. She thinks she can turn her life around and discover what she is really made of. Cheryl decides to hike the entire Pacific Crest Trail...alone with no experience, but plenty of gumption. She seeks to find the discipline to become the woman, she always wanted to be. Minor injuries and loneliness proves to not break her determination. The trek provides some beautiful scenery. There is some brief sexual content, nudity and strong language to earn an R rating.A great soundtrack that features ""El Condor Pasa"" by Simon & Garfunkel, ""Let 'Em In"" by Paul McCartney & Wings and ""The Air That I Breathe"" by The Hollies. Other music by the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Free, Billy Swan, Charlie Rich, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley.Also in the cast: Laura Dern, Thomas Sadoski, W.

12,sunwarrior13,Wild Is An Inspiring Film On Change,9,8 July 2015,"Cheryl Strayed's 2012 memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail is adapted for this film that tells the story of a woman who went on a thousand miles of hiking to overcome many things in her life such as her divorce,mother's death and many years of destructive behaviors that included drugs,alcohol and sex.Reese Witherspoon starred in the film as Cheryl together with Laura Dern,who portrayed as her mother.The film written by Nick Hornby and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée goes through the events of Cheryl's life as well as the challenges she overcame during the hike considering her lack of experience.It ends when she reached the end of her destination at the so-called ""Bridge Of The Gods"" wherein she started a new life with a new family and children.This is definitely an emotional and powerful film about a woman who wanted to attain change in her life.Many viewers will find it to resonate in their lives especially during these tough times in the country.Added to that,it will also be inspiring for many people especially who have gone through difficulties in life like Cheryl and will find her a role model especially when it comes to living a better life.",Wild
13,grantss,"Interesting and moving, but requires a bit of patience",7,19 December 2015,"Interesting and moving, but requires a bit of patience.The (true) story of Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) who, in 1995, hiked the 1,700 km Pacific Crest Trail alone. She had never undertaken a hike of any significant distance and was largely under-prepared for the trip. The movie shows her trials and tribulations on the journey, and, via flashbacks, why she undertook it.Directed by Jean-Marc Valee (Dallas Buyers Club), with a screenplay written by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, About a Boy, An Education) you expect something emotional and profound. Yet, initially it is quite dull. For the first 30 minutes or so it just seems like a survival movie and, at that, the worst kind of survival movie - the kind where people voluntarily and unnecessarily put themselves in danger.However, over time you start to understand her motives, the life she is trying to escape from and what the journey means to her. Also, the incidents along the trail become more interesting, as do the people she meets.After that it is a very interesting and, at times, very emotional movie. The only bad note after this is the end, which feels rushed and comes out of the blue.Ultimately, not a brilliant movie - once you know her motives you still aren't entirely convinced she really need to walk 1,700 kms - but interesting and profound enough. Does make you ponder issues in your own life and how you deal with or move on from them.",Wild
14,oscaralbert,"This ""Ode to Masochism"" supposedly is based upon . . .",8,22 December 2014,". . . a true story. One scene shows the hiker chick character (as an adult) in bed with her little brother for some reason (since they're under the covers, it's impossible to see what they're actually doing). In another scene, this same glutton for punishment is commenting that it's hard to chew up a close relative's ashes, since they're more like gravel than what you'd get from burning paper. The posters, trailers, and media interviews for WILD make out that it's some sort of journey for female empowerment. I gave the flick an ""eight"" rating, because the scenery is nice and I like to support fellow backpackers. However, this movie unravels in a Non-linear fashion, with ""Cheryl's"" trek broken up by countless disjointed flashbacks. Her voice-overs say that she wants to be an ""experimenter"" rather than a talker, and that she'd do everything the same if given the chance. Yet yakking about her ""quest"" seems to be the only motive for making it in the first place, and it's amazing she got anyone to (ghost?) write and publish her alleged experiences, since nearly every other word of her voice-overs and conversations with other people seem to be some variant of the F-word. Further, the flashbacks show her dropping out of so many different things (school, Waitressing, marriage, pregnancy, counseling, etc.) in her Pre-trek days, it strains credulity that she covered as many miles as claimed. Further, no matter how much injury Hollywood make-up people can hoax onto actress Reese Witherspoon's body, none of the actual still photos of the real Cheryl at the end indicate ANY such deformities. Further, with Cheryl's WILD heroin-fueled nymphomaniac ways shown in the flashback, I would have found her the scariest thing on the trail in my hiking days (and that includes the three-foot-long pink rattlesnake I nearly stepped on running down the abandoned Tanner Trail--with a day pack--below the South Rim of the Grand Canyon on a day when the nearest person was 10 miles away!).",Wild
15,george.schmidt,Witherspoon gives her best performance since winning the Oscar (and may earn a richly deserved 2nd one),9,4 January 2015,"WILD (2014) ***1/2 Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Gaby Hoffman, Thomas Sadoski, Keene McRae, Michiel Huisman, W. Earl Brown, Kevin Rankin, Brian Van Holt, Cliff De Young. Witherspoon gives her best performance since winning the Oscar (and may earn a richly deserved 2nd one) as Cheryl Strayed, a young woman whose trek along the Pacific Crest Trail serves as a way of coping with the grief in the epic loss of her beloved mother (Dern, equally Oscar-worthy) and an attempt to 'find herself' in all ways meta. Based on Strayed's best seller, Nick Horby's adaptation streamlines her journey into a one-woman odyssey of the heart, soul and spirit and only interrupts with the occasional rest stop scenario and altercation along the line. Jean-Marc Valle's sure and steady direction wisely allows his star to shine for a character of dubious nature and broken background with beautiful cinematography by Yves Belanger and a soundtrack peppered with contemporary rock (i.e. Simon & Garfunkel et al) to make the journey complete. *Also - the most beautiful rendition of RED RIVER VALLEY since THE GRAPES OF WRATH.",Wild
16,neil-476,"A little strange, but not unenjoyable",8,23 January 2015,"Her marriage fails, her mother dies, and she descends into a self-destructive spiral of promiscuous sex and drug use. To find the worthwhile person her mother always saw inside her, Cheryl Stayed decides to hike the Pacific Crest trail up the US western seaboard.Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl in a film which is always interesting, but actually perhaps a little on the gentle side. The most traumatic moments are told in flashback as we see the elements which have driven Cheryl to undertake something which is, by most standards, a rather weird way to address one's inner demons. The hike itself, though not without its hardships, is mostly an exercise in picture postcards, other flaky hikers, and blisters (all of which are entertainingly shown, by the way). There are several attempts at driving up suspense by having other people appear to be worryingly menacing, but nothing amounts to anything serious.Witherspoon is rather good here, and there are moments of genuine emotion and some intensity. There is also some bad language, graphic drug use, and sex and nudity (for those who have paid notice to Witherspoon's past comments about not wishing to do nudity because her body is horrible, this film provides evidence to the contrary). For those who care, the sex and nudity is relatively minimal and does excellent work in illustrating Cheryl's low self-esteem.I enjoyed this.",Wild
17,evanston_dad,Into the Wild with Reese Witherspoon,8,20 May 2015,"A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother's (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven't been this impressed by her as an actress since ""Election"" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in ""Walk the Line""). And it's nice to see Laura Dern again, who's popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie's editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character's hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.One of the minor miracles of ""Wild"" is how subtly it explores not just the trials and dangers one would encounter in such a hike, but specifically how those trials and dangers are heightened, or at least are of a different nature, for a woman. Only once in the film is it overtly addressed, but before that scene late in the film, the director and Witherspoon have already conveyed without words how perilous such an adventure could be for a young woman, for whom every encounter with a strange man carries with it the possibility of sexual predation, even if it doesn't materialize (which, the film acknowledges, in most cases it doesn't). At the same time, the film restores one's faith a little bit in humanity, suggesting that most people are decent and kind and willing to help, no strings attached.Witherspoon and Dern were both justly Oscar nominated for their performances, and the gorgeous Pacific West scenery deserved an award of its own.Grade: A",Wild
18,ferguson-6,Better a Hammer than a Nail,6,14 December 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. The best movies expertly provide a visual representation of quality writing. However, the film medium is somewhat limited, and especially struggles, in displaying the complexities of human introspection  something the best writers are able to capture with words on a page. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyer's Club) and writer Nick Hornby (An Education, High Fidelity) are simply unable to capture the guts of Cheryl Strayed's memoir ""Wild: Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"" – despite the likely Oscar nominated performance of Reese Witherspoon.It's quite likely, given the steady stream of rave reviews, that my lack of connection with the film is firmly planted in a small minority of movie goers and film critics. On the bright side, it's a real pleasure to see Reese Witherspoon follow-up her no frills supporting role in Mud with a strong portrayal of uber-flawed Cheryl.The story picks up with Cheryl getting ready for her 1100 mile hike of the Pacific Crest Trail in the summer of 1995. Her lack of trail experience is obvious from the unwrapped, shiny new contents of her ""monster"" backpack. While walking alone with her thoughts, memories are triggered by such things as a song, a horse, and even a phrase. It's through these flashbacks that we learn the reasons for Cheryl's trek towards self-discovery. The illness and death of her beloved mother, a childhood marred by an abusive father, her own crumbled marriage brought on by her promiscuity (""I cheated on him a lot""), and her attempts to dull the pain through heroin abuse, have led Cheryl to the trail head of re-discovering her true self.Cheryl's mother is played by Laura Dern (a terrific performance) and while her inspiration is obvious, there is one especially poignant scene that takes place in the kitchen  Bobbi tells Cheryl that she fully understands their plight, and refuses to let that define her life. That powerful scene is negated by the awkward and unexplained relationship Cheryl has with her ex-husband (Thomas Sadoski), the underdeveloped best friend support shown from an intriguing Gaby Hoffmann, and the voice mail connection with her brother (Keene McRae). More of these key people and fewer flashbacks might have allowed us to better relate to Cheryl as a person, rather than someone who hasn't dealt well with a few life obstacles.The familiar guitar strumming of Simon and Garfunkel's ""El Condor Pasa"" is heard throughout, as are numerous literary quotes that Cheryl used to leave her mark in the trail journals. There are, of course, similarities here to other films such as Into The Wild, 127 Hours, and Eat Pray Love. Also present is the element of a solitary woman in the wilderness  every male presence is greeted with anxiety from Cheryl, especially in contrast to the warm greeting she offers another female hiker.The biggest missing link for me was Cheryl's apparent epiphany. We witness a couple of emotional breakdowns along the trail, plus big time blisters, damaged toenails, rain and snow, and nature's beauty. What's not explained is her personal growth and self-discovery – the moment when Cheryl put the past behind and went ""above her nerve"". While her desire and efforts are commendable, the real story would be her inner thoughts  those conversations going on inside her brain (and in the book) that led to a conclusion of which we aren't privy.",Wild
19,FlashCallahan,"Right food, wrong stove......",3,22 January 2015,"With the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother, Cheryl has lost all hope. After years of reckless behaviour, and abuse to her body, and close friends, she makes decision to hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. This is supposedly the story of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddens, strengthen, and ultimately heals her, but unfortunately, its Reese Witherspoon walking............a lot.And this is what we get this time every year, award baiting movies filling the cinema to show the public that 'Yes, I was in This Means War, but I was also in Walk The Line, and I got, like, awards for that and everything'.Some are great, 'Whiplash', 'Foxcatcher', and 'Birdman' are all must see movies, but then we get the desperate movies, much like this.It's the age old story of a person trying to find themselves by just forgetting everything, their priorities, and just going on a long blooming walk. And yes, it's beautiful to look at, but the film goes like this.........Walking, Flashback, meeting someone who may be a little scary, walking, walking, meeting someone nice, flashback, and walking.Repeat this for two hours, and you have your movie. It's not Witherspoons fault, she's perfectly fine, and shows us she has range by doing her hair slightly different to show her at different ages.But my biggest problem with this is Cheryl's reasoning to do this, and then, then, the studios deciding to make a film about it. Why? Its a story about a promiscuous, cheating, drug addicted person who couldn't face the predictable clichés of life.She had a poorly paid job, over 60% of the planets population have poorly paid jobs, shall we all go for a walk?Her mother died, people deal with death all the time, they stay at home with their loved ones and deal with it, they don't buy hiking boots and a tent.If you want to see a good film in this sub genre, watch 'Into The Wild', a worthy film. This just seemed pointless, a selfish persons story, turned into and unnecessary, good looking film.Can't wait until next year where DiCaprio stars as that man who pushed a little girl over, and then went on to feed the homeless, you know,to find himself.And there will be a photo of the real person during the end credits so some idiot in the audience can point out 'that's him in real life'....",Wild
20,gradyharp,"'How wild it was, to let it be.'",5,26 April 2015,"Jean-Marc Vallée directs Nick Hornby's bumpy transcription of Cheryl Strayed's memoir and the result is a very long song. The two-hour running time feels as long as the time it took Strayed to walk the 1,100 mile Pacific Coast Trail solo. For those few who aren't familiar with the story, 'With the dissolution of her marriage and the death of her mother, Cheryl Strayed has lost all hope. After years of reckless, destructive behavior, she makes a rash decision. With absolutely no experience, driven only by sheer determination, Cheryl hikes more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddens, strengthen, and ultimately heals her.'Everyone praises Reese Witherspoon's performance so finding it tiresome is not a possible response. Much of the problem with this film is that 1) it is just too long, 2) the time on the trail is repetitive and not really redeeming, 3) the jumping around from past to present is clunky though Laura Dern and Thomas Sadowsi do rescue those portions, and 4) other than words on the screen in the last frame, is there any change in this character that we have observed in the hopscotch fashion of telling the story that is noticeable? Girl and brother are devastated by their mother's death so girl turns to alcohol, drugs, and frequent anonymous only to recreate a mother's influence in a sort of warped way by getting out and hiking. Must have missed something in the details.",Wild
21,zetes,Excellent,9,31 December 2014,"A wonder. Reese Witherspoon stars as Cheryl Strayed, a real life woman who hiked over a thousand miles on the Pacific Crest Trail in the mid-90s in order to move on from the pain of her mother's untimely death and the terrible depression (which included heroin abuse and rampant marital infidelity) which followed. The story is quite simple, but the soul searching feels very genuine and I found myself deeply involved in Strayed's situation. There's a universality about what she was going through, one can easily sympathize. The film is just gorgeously made. This is Vallée's best work, no doubt. The way the flashbacks are handled in particular are great. They come up in much the way memories would on such an expedition, and Cheryl's past is painted in quick brushstrokes that ultimately become a recognizable mural of a life. I also love the many people she meets on her journey, who pop up and disappear in mere moments. Each has their own story, which we catch only a glimpse of, as they have only caught a glimpse of her own. Laura Dern plays Witherspoon's mother in flashbacks and is also very good (I'm not sure whether this or The Fault in Our Stars is her best this year, but she's a very welcomed presence in both). This is one of the year's best films.",Wild

Probably boring stuff from Lynch or Von Trier... I really like Wild, because it's a good story well played by Reese Witherspoon. It's about a woman pushing her boundaries a little bit more every day to forget about some things that have gone bad in her life. She is alone on her journey and has time enough to think about her life, her decisions she made, about the good and bad souvenirs of her past. The nature shots are certainly making this movie worth a watch. After watching this movie it made me want to hike myself. To push yourself a little bit further then your are used to...",Wild
23,siderite,A biographical and introspective view into a woman's life,8,12 February 2017,"I like biographies and from this movie I glimpsed that probably the book it is based on was worth reading. The movie is very good as well, with Reese Witherspoon doing a good job portraying this woman who decides to hike 1100 miles in order to come to terms with her grief and put her life in order. However I have to give kudos to the director and screenwriters who managed to put this idea into a digestible movie. I would think it is very difficult.The film is very introspective, it touches on subjects like the death of a mother, the decay of a relationship and of a person until the only solution is a hard look inward. A refreshing film, but not one that feels entertaining or light of funny. You gotta be in the mood.",Wild

Cheryl Strayed, portrayed on-screen by Oscar-Winner Reese Witherspoon, comes across as a free-spirited soul, trapped in immense tragedy. Nick Hornby's Adapted Screenplay is frequently engaging & also disturbing. This is a difficult journey of a troubled soul & Hornby's Writing remains true to the essence of the true-story. Jean-Marc Vallée's Direction is pretty solid. Cinematography captures the wilderness, aptly. Editing, also, is crisp. Performance-Wise: Reese Witherspoon is uninhibited in her portrayal of Cheryl Strayed. Its a fearless performance, from an accomplished actress. Laura Dern as her deceased mother, who haunts her throughout the film, is in fine form, as well. On the whole, 'Wild' is a bit too serious, but overall, this is a story worth watching.",Wild
25,StevePulaski,"A testament to the most tender, encouraging part of the human spirit",8,31 December 2014,"In 1995, a woman in her early thirties by the name of Cheryl Strayed decided to cleanse her soul and rid herself of personal grief, sadness, and unhealthy demons by hiking over one-thousand miles along the Pacific Crest Trail by herself. The journey was a singular testament to freeing oneself from both unhealthy albatrosses and mental weight in order to not only be one with the land she was living off, but hopefully provide her with the perspective of the beauties of nature and such while living amongst it. Cheryl, who changed her last name to ""Strayed"" as a symbolic gesture, had a lot on her plate, and hiked with the thoughts of her recent divorce, the death of her mother, her drug addiction, and her overall downward spiral circling her mind. Just two of those things would be enough to cripple a person's psyche, or even drive them to suicide, but Cheryl takes arguably the most peaceful and assured way to deal with such feelings.Strayed's story of personal strength and the test of one's grit and motivation just lend themselves to film, which is why there is Jean-Marc Vallée's Wild, a film that attempts to capture the event and provide us with backstory of Strayed's life in flashback. I just wrote my review for The Imitation Game, and talked about how that film almost gets by entirely on the talent and merit of its lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch; the same goes for Wild, which has Reese Witherspoon playing Strayed in one of the most exhausting performances of her career. Witherspoon's character is put through so much in the film, from long nights high off of heroin, to somebody's overnight sex toy, and let's not forget the 1,100 mile trek she just committed to. She has to do so much with her character, and never does she miss a beat, effectively presenting us with a character we can love and root for at times and quietly detest at others because of the negative way she treats herself.One specific scene in Wild seems to be a metaphorical representation for all the weight Witherspoon has to bear in the film. The scene comes early, before she embarks on the hike, and shows her struggling to get her equipment on her back and proceed to stand up to hike. She is finally shown laying on the floor struggling to stand up, wiggling like a fish, with the weight of her camping equipment, hunting gear, and snack food weighing her down. Already, before she even leaves the motel room she is staying at, the task at hand seems like an insurmountable chore, as not only is her mental-load heavy, but her physical load almost entirely paralyzing.Vallée is still on something of a hot streak, after directing two Oscar winning performances in last year's Dallas Buyers Club, and takes on a film that is vaguely similar to his previous film in terms of how it approaches its central character. Witherspoon's Cheryl Strayed echoes familiar reminders of Matthew McConaughey's Ron Woodroof in the way that she starts out the film with her own centralized, somewhat stubborn attitude to go on to something of self-realization when she takes on something she never thought she could do (in Woodroof's case, his self-realization came when he was told he was suffering from the AIDS virus and went on to help others he previously ostracized overcome the disease by selling black market drugs to those who contracted the virus).The one negative quality in Wild doesn't come from its central character nor its quietly similar approach to said character, but the way Vallée and screenwriter Nick Hornby handle Strayed's story in presentation. The film is immediately burdened by constant flashbacks to Strayed's past, which interrupt the chronological continuity and make it so we can never fully get comfortable in one particular setting. While many films use the flashback method quite frequently, and here some flashbacks are kind of required to get involved with this character, when we're watching Strayed embark on a soul-cleansing journey, to keep ping-ponging back and forth, never allowing audiences to fully settle in and sink into her present situation doesn't provide us with the kind of connection we need for this film. In addition, the rampant flashbacks provide little opportunities to allow audience interpretation of Strayed's life. As stated, it'd be difficult to do the film without some kind of flashbacks, but many of the ones we get blatantly spell out certain situations when they probably would've been better left somewhat unknown to us.Conducting Wild in a similar fashion to last year's underrated and overlooked All is Lost would've been something to behold; that particular film concerned Robert Redford as a sailor who was trying to survive while alone in the middle of the Indian Ocean. That film had very little dialog, and succeeded on the low-key tone set forth by the screenplay and, of course, Redford's almost-entirely physical performance. It would've been intriguing to see long, intimate shots of Witherspoon walking the Trail, stopping to eat, making fire and pitching a tent to survive, before doing the same thing. It would've been a contemplative journey not only for her, but for us, the audience.Wild, nonetheless, has the ability to encourage and motivate, something few films nowadays can do without being emotionally manipulative or downright poorly-written. This particular film is neither; it's buoyed by a fantastic performance and concerns the deeply-human ideas of trying to forgo one's past in order to embrace the future by attempting to temporarily free one's mind through untold bliss. Even as the currents get rough, the mountains get steep, and Strayed becomes physically exhausted seeing her push through is something that touches the most tender, encouraging part of the human spirit, what I believe Wild is a testament to through and through.",Wild
26,blanbrn,A self discovery journey of thought that showcases flashbacks of painful memories of life.,9,20 December 2014,"I must say that watching ""Wild"" was a treat it's one journey of discovery and self thought and most of the film is done in flashback manner which is a focus of a painful past of one Cheryl Strayed. This is an actual true tale which was also a best selling memoir, as in the mid 90's Cheryl Strayed did indeed hike and travel the Pacific Crest Trail and it was a 1,100 mile solo hike! And director Jean Marc Vallee has taken this film with the direction of grace and gut. To get more into detail of the journey and for real the character it's story is of Cheryl Strayed(in an act turning rejuvenation performance from America's girl Reese Witherspoon)a young woman who's had a bad luck life and been dealt a tough deck. As thru flashback we see that Cheryl has left Minnesota after a split from her husband and with the loss of her mom Bobbi(Laura Dern)from cancer, it's clear that this lady needs a journey to get away to take her mind off of her problems and the only way is on a long journey on the Pacific Crest Trail all thru the west coast states. This film with it's scenes are tough and raw from her mom's death, to the heroin use and it showcases all of the causal sex that Cheryl has along the way. It's important as this film shows that peace and being away on a journey creates a sense of solitude as life is a journey of self discovery and finding a recovery sense and trying to forget the wicked past of loss and hurt still that's what life is full of and all about as Cheryl would not have changed a thing or have done anything different her story was all about a life and hike on the wild side.",Wild
27,DKosty123,Hollywood Movie Hack,4,25 May 2015,"Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Gaby Hoffmann | - Why is it in movies that only beautiful women in crisis want to get it on? Is this why few women no matter how good they look, ever celebrate their bodies for what they should be - a temple which should be climbed all over and used for what nature intended. When I get infatuated with a woman, I have no urge to hit her. I have an urge to massage every inch of her body with all the tools I can and make her feel as good as she looks. I would want to make those private moments give her such intense pleasure that she would want lots more. and to make it more absurd, no matter what Reese Witherspoon does, her hair is always untouched by anyone besides the studio hair dresser. That likens this movie to old time Hollywood. Instead of reality, we have these values.I can look at Witherspoon all day and all night. The trouble is this does not come off as real enough. that is not her fault but I would like to give her an intense pleasure and mess up her hair, especially the hair below the waist.",Wild
28,lasttimeisaw,"A star vehicle for Witherspoon, but it is not tailor-made.",6,29 May 2015,"After consummating ""McConaissance"" in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013), Jean-Marc Vallée's next step is another star-vehicle biography, Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a young woman embarked on a 2,650-mile hike of Pacific Crest Trail from Minneapolis, Minnesota to the Bridge of the Gods connecting Oregon and Washington in 1995. The aim of her journey is to detoxicate herself from her past bad habits of promiscuity and heroin addiction which had encroached her entire life after the untimely death of her mother Bobbi (Dern) and had already destroyed her marriage with Paul (Sadoski). Opening with a cringing-inducing toenail-plucking gambit, as if the film is promising us an unpromising depiction of the mission-impossible trek for a novice hiker, then incessantly throws back spasmodic flashbacks to proffer backgrounds of our heroine in order to wheedle us into awe-inspiring admiration. The approach is recommendable, but there is a problem at hand (at least for me), my admiration is already in full default mode for anyone who has the willpower and actually accomplishes the formidable undertaking, so to progressively know her back-story can only amass my cynical suspicions of either a victorious bandwagon out of vainglory or a navel-gazing inspection to find an excuse for her self-destructive conducts, or both. Fortunately, the film opts for a safer route, neither blatantly beautifies her ritual of reborn, nor goes digging deep into her most vulnerable part in her memories. Generically, it maintains her long haul in a tepid temperature apart from the overhanging threat of being raped in the wilderness, as the ethical yardstick for Cheryl's before/after metamorphosis. Witherspoon finally proves that it is not just a fluke for her (undeserving) Oscar triumph in WALK THE LINE (2005, 9/10), which takes her almost a decade. Granted that the physical endeavour of a petite Witherspoon shouldering on her ginormous backpack for the first time before her hiking already pre-empts audience's respect, she is still unable to fuel her role with a consistent intensity to make viewers wow for her through and through, check her scenes with Dern, where she conspicuously fades into background or looks rather wooden in comparison, the but when she is on her own, she is fine, sometimes even great, for her daring nudes scenes and (spoiler alert) making out with drop-dead gorgeous Michiel Huisman.Laura Dern is the dark horse in the BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS race this year, since her screen time is not only brief, but exclusively in flashbacks as well, not to mention most of those scenes are edited into transitory fragments as if she is just a symbolistic prop to burden Cheryl's mental state. In fact Dern has only one Oscar-bait scene when she tells Cheryl the reason of being cheerful and optimistic in their not-so-perfect life, she nails it impeccably, and de facto she is the one who really deserves a renaissance! On a whole, I'm a bit underwhelmed by the movie, the performances is its strongest suit, but the empty nature of its material restrains it from being a resounding feminist opus, and Vallée's execution doesn't enhance the film to match the caliber of his best offering, aka. C.R.A.Z.Y. (2005, 8/10).",Wild
29,sddavis63,The Best I've Ever Seen From Reese Witherspoon,9,16 December 2017,"I'm accustomed to seeing Reese Witherspoon in lighter fare than this. She's generally pretty good in that kind of stuff, but just the genre itself means that she's never really ranked in what I would call my ""A"" list of actresses. But my appreciation of her talent increased immensely when I saw her in ""Wild."" She carries this movie on her back just as much as her character carries her heavy backpack throughout most of the movie. She's in pretty much every scene, so nothing really happens without her, and she's excellent. With all due respect to Julianne Moore, Witherspoon probably should have won the Oscar for best actress that year, and why ""Wild"" did not even earn an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I'm aware that Cheryl Strayed (on whose memoir this movie is based) said that it was a case of sexism - suggesting that because the movie was based on a woman's experience it didn't get the respect it deserved. Whether that's true or not I have no idea, but overlooking the movie was a huge and sad oversight.As Strayed, Witherspoon was portraying a very troubled young woman dealing with a whole lot of demons in her life - an abusive father, a loving mother who died far too young, a failed marriage. All those things led to drug addictions and sexual promiscuity and eventually an unwanted pregnancy until Cheryl finally decides to basically find herself and get her life back together by committing to hike about 1000 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail - in spite of the fact that as far as hiking goes she's completely inexperienced and totally unprepared. The movie does a superb job of following her along the trail, recounting some of the experiences she has along the way. You expect her to encounter trouble, but although some of her experiences are (or seem) threatening, nothing really bad ever happens to Cheryl, and for the most part she meets a lot of really nice people along the way. It's more a case of the mood that gets set along the way. In fact, most of what happens on the Trail is so unexciting that I can't even call them adventures - and so I use the word ""experiences."" But the story isn't so much about the Trail or what happens to her - it's about a journey of self-discovery; a journey that helps her come to terms with who she is and where she's been and - just maybe - where she's going. Director Jean-Marc Vallee, I thought, did a great job of moving forward a story that wasn't really ""exciting"" but keeping it interesting all the way through. The movie intersperses the story of Cheryl's hike, with her backstory, through flashbacks as far back as her childhood and up into her troubled adulthood after her mother's death, and these flashbacks certainly help us to understand how Cheryl got to the point where she needed to do something to re-centre her life. I'm not sure that, in similar circumstances, I'd choose a 1000 mile hike - but she did, and it seemed to work for her.There's really not much to criticize here. The ending may be a little bit rushed - this was a rare movie that left me thinking that maybe there could have been just a bit more? But, overall, I was really impressed with this. In some respects it reminded me a little bit of the 1999 movie ""The Straight Story."" I wasn't sure that a movie about a woman going on a long hike would be able to keep me interested for almost two hours. But it did. (9/10)",Wild
30,Hellmant,Truly awesome!,8,2 January 2015,"'WILD': Four Stars (Out of Five)Biographical drama flick about a woman who decides to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone, as a way of getting over her mother's death and a recent divorce. It's based on the memoir 'Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail', by Cheryl Strayed. Reese Witherspoon stars as Strayed in the film and it also costars Laura Dern, Gaby Hoffmann and Thomas Sadoski. It was directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (who also directed the critically acclaimed 'DALLAS BUYERS CLUB', last year) and written by Nick Hornby (the acclaimed writer of popular books, turned movies, like 'HIGH FIDELITY', 'ABOUT A BOY' and 'FEVER PITCH'). It was also filmed on location in Oregon and California. I absolutely loved the scenery and local imagery (being from Oregon) and thought the movie itself was pretty interesting and well made too.The film is set in 1995, right after Cheryl Strayed (Witherspoon) lost her mother (Dern), suddenly and tragically, to a fatal illness. As a way of trying to cope with her depression, Cheryl began doing lots of drugs and sleeping with any guy she could hook up with. This also lead to her husband (Sadoski) wanting a divorce. Cheryl then decided to set out on a 1,100 mile hike, across the Pacific Crest Trail, (by herself) as a way of trying to heal her psychological wounds. The film chronicles her journey. Witherspoon does give a strong and powerful performance in the film (much better than her Oscar winning work in 'WALK THE LINE') and she deserves all of her upcoming awards attention. Witherspoon did get a lot of help (though) from a great story, as well as on set support from Cheryl Strayed (for shoots in Oregon) and great direction from Jean-Marc Vallee (who directed two Oscar winning performances just last year, in 'DALLAS BUYERS CLUB'). I enjoyed the movie mostly because of it's Oregon scenery and I really liked seeing a local actor (Greg James), who has worked with a local filmmaker I know, in a sex scene with Reese Witherspoon! That's truly awesome!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/XBTsoCDCJpU",Wild
31,Robert_duder,An okay story made infinitely better by one of Hollywood's greatest talents,8,21 January 2015,"Sometimes I forget just how great Reese Witherspoon is. She is an acting legend and so young at that. I knew practically nothing about Wild outside of the plot going into it. I was watching it strictly due to its Oscar nominations and positive feedback I had heard. Its a very different sort of ""survival"" film or an adult coming of age film. This character which the entire film focuses on is someone very flawed and human and has had a lot of experience in her young life and its a lot to take in as she reminisces and remembers things she has experienced in her past as she goes on this immense spiritual journey. I can completely understand if someone (especially a woman) told me this was their favourite film and how it moved them. For me personally, it didn't really hit all the notes that it would for someone who could relate more to this character. It was still a good movie and I enjoyed it but it just wasn't made for me. I know its a very spiritual film and therefore it will speak to different people in different ways. It is a very similar concept and idea behind Martin Sheen's film ""The Way"" which moved me in ways few other films ever have. This movie though is ten times what it would be without Reese Witherspoon.We already know how versatile and incredibly charismatic she is. This role is very gritty for her and has a dark side and lets her show off her ability to play a character with a lot of flaws. I don't think the nudity is necessary in the film but I'm sure it would bring in a certain viewer to know she has a few brief nude scenes that are definitely gratuitous in nature and unnecessary. Witherspoon deserves her Oscar nod for this. It is very nearly a one woman show. While there are a few other supporting characters in flashbacks and people she meets along the trail, the film rests squarely on her shoulders. Laura Dern is this year's ""I don't get it"" performance. I will explain that. Each year, a performance gets a bunch of critical acclaim and its either incredibly small or unremarkable and you begin to think it must be more political in nature that the critics love it so much. Dern is decent in her role as Witherspoon's beloved mother but its a microscopically small supporting role with only a few scenes and I would hardly call it remarkable. To give her an Oscar nomination for it is head scratching to me. Thomas Sadoski is just as good as Dern, has just as many scenes and you don't hear anything about him.As expected the cinematography in Wild is simply beautiful. The scenes of nature and the rolling desert landscape. There is something artistically intricate about this woman's dark past and the often treacherous journey she is on. Its a very smart script and beautifully shot by director Jean-Marc Vallee who gets lucky again this year after last year's Dallas Buyer's Club by having terrific leading role in a story that potentially could have been just okay. I don't mean to downplay this woman's journey, I simply mean that anyone else in this role and it may not have popped in the same way. The film is slow burning and it really grows on you so that in the end regardless of whether it really touches you or not, it sticks with you and you're thinking about it. Its not a film that you simply forget about it and move on or watch just to turn your brain off. 8.5/10",Wild
32,ThomasDrufke,Finding Your Best Self,7,13 April 2015,"Everyone loves survival stories and everyone loves a story about someone making the most out of a second chance. Though Wild isn't a forced survival story like say Gravity, it has all the right elements of a great biography on screen. Strong lead cast, beautiful landscape/cinematography, plenty of hurdles, and oh yeah, all of this actually happened.The first scene of the movie gives us an idea of just how dark and real this film may be. We see Cheryl, played by Reese Witherspoon pulling off one of her toenails. Luckily the rest of the film isn't as gruesome or brutal. Cheryl had her fair share of personal issues, which include an abusive father, drug and alcohol problems, borderline prostitution, and her inability to connect with her mother. The movie uses flashbacks to show her personal failures to coincide with the 1,100 mile hike she goes on to deal with her various tragedies. Reese Witherspoon gives what is likely her most daring and difficult role yet. Make no mistake about it, this woman was just not a very good person before the hike. She cheating on her boyfriend, pushed her family away, got herself knocked up and used heroine. Somehow Witherspoon is able to reel in the performance to make her a likable young woman who has just lost her ways.At the core of the story is a girl who hopes she isn't letting herself down while also trying to find her best self. Her mother, played by Laura Dern, also had her many mishaps but somehow found a way to look at life with a smile. That's one of the several themes throughout is making yourself believe that things are going to get better no matter how bad it has gotten. Now some have complained that everything is tied in a bow pretty nicely in the end, which is a fair complaint. I can't disagree, but I can also let it go knowing that it's a movie, nothing has to be exactly the way it was in real life. But I would have liked to have seen the film turn to the dark and spiritual feel of the rest of the film.+Remarkable story +Lead acting +Use of flashbacks -Ending wraps a bow pretty neat 7.5/10",Wild

35,atlasmb,A Harsh Life Examined,6,25 October 2019,"Reese Witherspoon certainly challenged herself when she took on this project based upon a memoir. And the film challenges viewers to endure the hardships of her character's life, hoping for an emotional payoff. I think some will find this film spiritually uplifting and others will consider it an unsatisfying slog through a depressing story.Cheryl Strayed (Witherspoon) made an ignorant and irresponsible decision to hike the length of the Pacific Crest Trail. It was penance and a last-ditch hope for transmogrification of a life without value. Her past was a horror story of bad luck and bad decisions. As a result, she had lost respect for herself.Uninformed and ill-equipped, she learns as she goes, encountering people of all stripes. But most of the time, she is alone with her demons and her memories. We hear her thoughts and view pieces of her unfortunate life. Often there is a stream-of-consciousness feeling to the narrative. Other times, the exposition becomes nearly hallucinatory. These moments feel true to the story, thanks to the direction and Witherspoon's acting.There are few laughs in this film. It is the story of a harsh life. But there is a triumph of will, despite some instances of mere luck. There are not many people to whom I would recommend this film, but I am glad I saw it. And I appreciate the vulnerability that it required of Witherspoon.I don't consider this a film of redemption, but a story of self-education.

37,tabuno,Almost Perfect Immersion Into Life,9,15 January 2019,"10 January 2015. Some people would compare Wild to Sean Penn's Into The Wild (2007) where a 24-year old student sells off his possessions and then hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Instead a closer comparative movies might be Kevin McDonald's Touching The Void (2003) about two climbers who brave the Andes Mountains or Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation (2003) about an American television star who is hired to perform in a commercial in Japan. While Sean Penn directs a movie which in replete with fantastic and mesmerizing photography along with the performance by Emile Hirsh where both background and foreground seem to compete for attention, Sean-Mark Vallee has created a backdrop that enhances the performance of Reese Witherspoon on her 1,000 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.Wild might even be compared, in part, to the immersive, first person experience of horror classic The Blair Witch Project (1999) using a fusion of first and third person perspectives. Both McDonald and Coppola achieve in their movies like Wild are natural experiences that are artistically crafted to reflect ordinary but interesting events or sensations. The power of Vallee's direction is his ability to maintain engagement with the imagination of the audience. Surprisingly the move offers little in the way of drama ordinarily but quite the opposite. Vallee brings to more meaning to little experiences that we often take for granted as well as the novelty of the reasonable possibility of actual live experiences that we ourselves might be able to witness.Vallee's use of flashbacks as actual recollections of memory is one of the most effective elements of this movie that seem to parallel the brief mental sensations we have in our own lives. Nick Hornby and Cheryl Strayed's screenplay from her own personal memoirs captures the audience in a slow unfolding story of personal discovery of the backstory to Reese Witherspoon's character through effective flashbacks while she is hiking in the present. With only one noticeable continuity error regarding a book cover and Reese Witherspoon's sudden break down and crying scene, this movie seems flawless in production.In sum, Wild is a quality film experience along with a pertinent, relevant snapshot of life and endurance.",Wild
38,Reno-Rangan,Return to where we've come from to revive our life.,8,30 June 2015,"Ever since the movie 'Dallas Buyers Club' grabbed the three golden statues at the Oscars, the director has been in the spotlight. But I was enjoying his movies before that and yet this one is another remarkable adventurous-drama based on the real expedition into the wild. Cheryl Strayed whose story was this film based upon appeared in the beginning scene where she drops off her version of the movie character and wishes her a luck.The world is round, you can't runaway with your problems. If you do, you might end up where you have started. That's why its called a circle of life, goes round and round and round. You can hide your issues with yourself, but it may lead to a depression. Sometime when an experiment goes wrong, it's better to restart from the scratch with a different method. Here in our (human) lives some people do the same, return to where we've come from to restore the lost life. Of course I said all these, because this flick was inspired by such real incident.I prefer this film was very close to the Australian movie 'Tracks' than bringing 'Into the Wild' into the frame. Obviously the Australian movie and this one are about the two young women, but the thing is, the story deals with the different motivation for their decision to take part in the quest. The Aussie flick has an edge over this when it comes to the challenges faced during the journey and also I loved from narration to photography, music and performance.Since they both inspired by the true story, I appreciate the filmmaker's effort to bring them into the screen and salute to those two magnificent ladies. In both the films, both the women psychologically affected by their earlier stage of lives which was one of the reasons to step into the wild. I feel, 'Tracks' should have been nominated instead this movie for the Academy Awards.""I've always been someone's daughter or mother or wife. I never got to be in the driver's seat of my own life.""It was a wonderful 2014 for Reese Witherspoon. Back to back career reviving; biographical and inspiring human emotion movies in this graphic, sci-fi and fantasy dominated era. The year's sweetheart for the critics and I doubt there will be another same year. Remember, she was nominated for the Oscars for her role in this film.The disappointment was the adventures. Not what I expected. The struggles were unable to reach for our deep heart compared to other self-discovery voyage films. Weight she carried and losing a toe nail, I don't see much impact because those are supposed to happen. This PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) is well planned and partially protected the hikers with all the needs supplied all along the route. The only thing they have to do is stay away from the wild lives and watch-out for the intruders between the checkpoints.In other end coping with depression was what I loved in the movie. Without those flashbacks this film was nothing. Literally, this story all about the mental healing. The pain she carried, she just wanted to eject it from her body and mind, and the journey helped it. The funny thing is I liked Laura Dern a lot than anybody in the movie. Her character as well as her dialogues was very inspiring. Her nominee for the actress in a supporting role was justified. I can watch this film again and again, only for her alone, sadly she won't appear for a long stay.I loved it, but not completely pleased with the product. The reason is 'Tracks'.

39,eddie_baggins,"Lacking emotional engagement, Witherspoon is the star here",6,28 June 2015,"It's a movie that screams ""Oscar"" for its female lead and a film based around a redemptive true story but for all the good Wild does (which is largely in its use of its natural scenery) it never threatens to become something truly special that its very much like minded and similarly titled Into the Wild did back in 2007.Directed by Dallas Buyers Club's Jean-Marc Vallee, Wild is a step up in cinematic posturing from that solid drama in many aspects yet where Buyers Club found a soul in amongst all of the larger than life events Wild never hits high notes on its emotional payoffs due to a strange flashback structure, some unengaging inner monologues and sense we never really get to know Reese Witherspoon's Cheryl Strayed despite the fact we've spent the time with her on her months long journey walking the Pacific Crest Trail. Blame for this lack of real emotionally punch falls largely on famed writer Nick Hornby's script that doesn't ring enough out of Cheryl's troubled tales before her life affirming quest despite Witherspoon giving it her all in a deservedly noted turn as the troubled soul.Clearly committed to the role it's great to see Witherspoon invest her time into something noteworthy in front of the camera and she elevates Wild to a higher level thanks to her warts and all turn. It would've taken a huge toll on the actress both emotionally and physically in such a demanding turn and this is arguably Witherspoon's finest moment, narrowly beating out her memorable performance from Walk the Line. However good Witherspoon is here it's a travesty that the film's most emotionally charged scenes are mostly ruined due to a decision to use Witherspoon as a young Sheryl. Believability is often entirely ruined when we flash back from a middle aged Cheryl walking the trail to her days as a student and no amount of makeup can hide the fact we are witnessing a 40 plus year old actress play dress ups as a teenager. It would've also had been nice to get more of a feel for Cheryl and her relationship with estranged ex-husband Paul played by Thomas Sadoski and also her time with the undeservedly Oscar nominated Laura Dern as her caring mother Bobbi but Vallee marks his intention often that the trail is where his focus is on.With some great cinematography and a committed turn by the Oscar nominated Witherspoon, Wild is worthy of your time, yet one can't help but feel deep down there was a more emotionally resonate drama to be explored in the tale of lost soul finding redemption out in the great wilds of the American landscape that makes Wild feel like somewhat of a missed opportunity when it had the story, the actress and the lands to make something truly special. As a film for all us anti-camping flag-wavers however, this could just become our quintessential showcase for our cause.3 delicious oat's dinners out of 5",Wild
40,Red-125,Witherspoon and Dern are outstanding in this film,8,29 December 2014,"Wild (2014) was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed in a role based on Strayed's ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail."" Laura Dern plays Strayed's mother, Bobbi.In general, I don't like acts of physical daring that are considered heroic. For me, climbing a mountain or sliding deep down into a cave give artificial thrills. My thought is that if you want to be heroic and face danger, volunteer to work at an Ebola clinic in Sierra Leone. Plenty of danger, and, if and when you survive, you have something about which you can be truly proud.In the same way, I'm not impressed by movies about people who voluntarily put themselves into dangerous situations or enter into situations of physical hardship. That's exactly what Strayed (Dern) did when she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. Given what I've just written, it may be surprising that I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.The reason I liked this film is the acting by Witherspoon and Dern. I don't know Cheryl Strayed, and I haven't read her book, so I can't tell if Witherspoon got it right. But, my guess is that she did. She looked right--whether tired, thirsty, frustrated, frightened, or (sometimes) triumphant. More importantly, her pain and self-disgust after some truly terrible life events and bad choices made it understandable that she would undertake this challenging walk as a way of pulling her life back together and giving it a purpose and direction.Laura Dern was equally excellent in her portrayal of Strayed's mother, Bobbi, who had been dealt some bitter blows, but was determined to make the best of her situation and not collapse into depression and defeat.We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work better on the large screen because of the beautiful vistas that Witherspoon encounters as she walks north. However, this isn't a film that you enjoy because of the scenery, so if you can't see it in a theater, watch it on DVD. I think you'll be glad you did.",Wild
41,leonblackwood,Expected an in depth look into such an amazing achievement! 5/10,5,18 July 2015,"Review: Although Cheryl's (Reese Witherspoon) journey was truly amazing, I did find the movie quite boring. The performances were good and the true story is a massive achievement but for entertainment, I wasn't that impressed. After battling with a shady past, the lose of her mother and a failed marriage, Cheryl decides to walk across the Pacific Crest Trail which is a 1,100 mile hike into the wilderness. This movies shows her amazing journey and some of the situations that she came across along the way. Her past seemed more interesting than the actual hike, from an entertainment point of view. I would have liked to see how the journey changed her life and how she was able to mend her broken heart from the lost of her mum and husband but the director chose to stick with the hike angle, with a few flashbacks. I liked the cinematography and some of the shots were truly amazing but I was hoping for more emotion, especially when she finally reached her destination. I did like the scenes when she was trying to get the backpack on her back and when she met up with a couple of other hikers on the way but I did feel quite empty at the end, for some unknown reason. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, just to see her amazing journey but it seems like the director jumped into the middle of her life without explaining the beginning or end. Watchable!Round-Up: I was looking forward to watching this film because I'm getting a bit soppy in my old age and I'm starting to enjoy emotional drama but I did feel a bit let down with the outcome. Reese Witherspoon put in a decent performance and at 39, she has become a top pick in Hollywood since her Oscar winning performance in Walk The Line. She was a Oscar nominee for this role but she lost out to Julianne Moore in Still Alice. Anyway, she hasn't really had time out from the big screen, since her Oscar win and a lot of her movies have grossed a lot of money at the box office. She has played major roles in Water For Elephants, This Means War, Mud and Devil's Knot and she added her voice to the big budget Monsters vs. Aliens so her portfolio is pretty impressive. Anyway, this film was directed by a Canadian director called Jean-Marc Vailee who brought you the Dallas Boy's Club and Young Victoria. Personally, I think that he could have shown some of the darker sides to her journey which would have made it seem more real but thats just me being over judgemental. Like many true stories, I love it when I want to find out more about the true story after watching the film but I didn't get that feeling at the end of this movie.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $53millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about a woman's 1100 mile hike across the Pacific Crest Trail after losing her mother, a failed marriage and heroine addiction. 5/10",Wild
42,howard.schumann,An empowering transformation,8,1 October 2014,"The poet Rilke said ""There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms; from out of a silent crevice, an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence."" That unknowing weed sings loud and clear in Jean Marc Vallée's (Dallas Buyer's Club) Wild, the story of 26-year-old Cheryl Strayed's 1,000 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995 in an attempt to redeem a troubled past. Unlike John Curran's Tracks which documented naturalist Robyn Davidson's grueling nine-month journey through the Australian outback, Wild is more of an inward-looking psychological drama than a physical adventure, but it has enough of both to keep us focused.Based on a best-selling memoir, Wild stars Reese Witherspoon as Strayed, who hikes through deserts and mountains from California to Washington, pushing herself to the limit of her physical and mental strength. It is Witherspoon's best performance in years and is likely to raise Oscar speculation. From the beginning when Cheryl takes off her hiking boots to show us socks dripping with blood from a ""disengaged"" toenail, we know that we are not in for a pleasant walk in the park. Additional physical hardships lurk, waiting to spring. While lugging around a thousand- pound backpack dubbed ""The Monster,"" a metaphor for the ""baggage"" she carries around with her, Strayed has to face running out of water, confronting unfriendly rattlesnakes, and avoiding threatening encounters with some good ol' boys that remind her that, as a woman traveling by herself, she faces risks most men would not.Most of the film, however, centers on numerous flashbacks to Cheryl's childhood memories and they are not always pleasant. We see snippets of her recollection of the traumas she faced when growing up – her life with an abusive, alcoholic father, the death of her adored mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) from cancer at the age of 45, and her subsequent freefall into heroin addiction, promiscuous sex, and failed marriages. As she passes the trail logs that dot the route, Cheryl enters short pithy comments that reflect her emotional state at the moment such as ""God is a ruthless bitch,"" quotes that join other artists and poets such as Walt Whitman, Emily Dickenson, and Joni Mitchell.Relying on her innate skill, her odyssey is not an exercise in self-flagellation, but a way to reach for a new sense of self, a point where she is able to forgive herself and others. While the film displays much positive energy, there is also a sense of emotional overload that often feels calculated and straining for profundity where understatement would have worked better. The film is also not well served by a pointless meeting with a black reporter from the Hobo Times, and by shameless commercial tie-ins with Snapple and REI, (which Cheryl praises as the best corporation ever).In spite of its flaws, however, Vallée keeps the clichés manageable while the richly expressive performances of Witherspoon and Dern, the poetic sounds of Simon and Garfunkel's El Condor Pasa, and a memorable rendition of Red River Valley from a most unlikely source, combine to rescue Wild from its flirtation with banality and turn Cheryl's dark journey into an empowering transformation.",Wild

44,l_rawjalaurence,Beautifully Photographed but Structurally Flawed,5,28 August 2015,"WILD is an interesting film, a narrative of personal development during which Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) travels across the Pacific Crest Trail on her own as a way of escaping the miseries of her existence - the loss of her mother (Laura Dern), and her subsequent slide into sex and drugs, culminating in her eventual divorce.On the route she encounters a variety of obstacles, including natural disasters as well as predatory men. Cheryl manages to overcome them through a combination of luck and mental strength. At the end she discovers herself, and can face the rigors of marriage and family with renewed vigor.Jean-Marc Vallée's film is beautifully photographed with a fine sense of place and time. Cheryl walks for ninety days through all weathers, and finds ways of coping with the exigencies of having to survive on her own. Yet the action is somehow banal; WILD tells a familiar tale, and there is little focus on Cheryl's character- development, even though the camera is obviously attracted to her profile, as well as to her naked torso on occasions.The ending is a total cop-out, as it shows Cheryl willingly accepting the patriarchal order where she has to become a homemaker, to achieve ""respectability"" after the purgatorial process endured by her walk. In the previous two hours we have seen her learning to fend for herself, and hence it's hardly likely that she would choose the security of home over further adventures. Nor does it seem likely that such a strong character, who can look after her mother in defense against an alcoholic father, would so readily turn to drugs as a crutch to cope with her miseries.WILD is an entertaining watch, to be sure, but is structurally flawed",Wild
45,jtindahouse,"A well written, inspirational story",8,17 January 2015,"If you've ever achieved something in life that you never thought yourself capable of, perhaps running a marathon (as was the case for me), climbing a mountain or perhaps even something fear-conquering like skydiving, then this movie will really hit home for you. That amazing feeling of accomplishment and achievement really can be life changing and incredibly therapeutic. 'Wild' does a fantastic job of portraying this.Both Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern have been nominated for Academy Awards in Best Actress in a Lead Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role respectively for their performances in 'Wild'. Witherspoon's was the more deserving of the two for mine. She's probably stronger in the flashback scenes, but her performance on the trail was also very moving. I see that quite a number of actresses were fighting for the role she ultimately won and it's not surprising, the role had 'Oscar nomination' written all over it. Dern on the other hand wasn't as strong. She was adequate but never blew me away. A weak year in the Supporting Actress category perhaps? 'Wild' is the emotion driven story of a woman on a 1,100 mile hike whose back story we learn along the way through flashbacks. It's very well written and does an incredible job of taking us on the journey with the character. We meet other characters along the way that range from the incredibly kind and generous through to some exceedingly suspicious and shady folk. It's based on the memoir written by the real life Cheryl Strayed which I suspect would be a very interesting read.The movie really is more about the character than the actual hike itself and the events that take place. If you simply looked at the film based on the hike you would probably be right in saying not a lot actually happened. But it's about more than that. It's about a person trying to turn their life around and making a life-changing decision. I wish a lot more people would consider doing something like this and hopefully this movie inspires a few to do just that.",Wild
46,Turfseer,Ignore all the angst and focus on Witherspoon's compelling low-key trek on the Pacific Crest Trail,6,1 December 2015,"What happens when you match a talented director such as Jean-Marc Vallée (responsible for the very fine ""Dallas Buyers Club"") and the bathetic screenwriter Nick Hornby (known for the lame ""An Education"" and recent soap opera ""Brooklyn"")? The answer is: a mixed bag! That's exactly what ""Wild"" appears to be. Hornby's script is based on Cheryl Strayed's 2012 memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. It stars Reese Witherspoon who probably wanted to play an edgier role in contrast to some of her earlier efforts where she's been pegged as more of an All-American girl type. Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed who took a journey of self-discovery, hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail without prior experience. Strayed's life had practically fallen apart after the death of her mother from cancer a few years earlier, her subsequent use of drugs (heroin in particular), and divorce from her husband due to her self-destructive behavior. The film is split into scenes featuring her foray into the wilderness and flashbacks chronicling her difficult earlier years.Undoubtedly the more compelling half of the film is when we're with Witherspoon as she hikes (carrying a super heavy backpack) into the Wilderness. There is always an element of danger for our protagonist, not only from the natural world (Cheryl avoids a rattlesnake in one instance) but also faces the fear and threat of sexual assault from a few different men she encounters.During her first encounter, Cheryl finds a gun inside a pickup truck belonging to a construction worker who offers her a ride back to his home for a shower and a cooked meal. It turns out that the guy is married and quite benign. More interesting events occur including a camper who helps Cheryl lighten the load on her backpack and advises her on how she can order a new pair of boots and have then delivered to the next way station.More obstacles are put in Cheryl's way which she must overcome. After removing her boot to remove a loose toenail, she loses one of the boots as it falls down the side of a mountain. Now she must improvise by wearing sandals covered with duct tape.The tension mounts when Cheryl almost runs out of water and then meets two hunters, one of whom appears to have a desire to sexually assault her. Again nothing bad really happens and she leaves the trail for a short respite in Ashland, Oregon, where she meets a nice guy named Jonathan (they attend a concert and then spend the night together).The denouement is touching as Cheryl encounters a llama that had got loose from a young boy and his grandmother. After Cheryl mentions that her mother had died, the boy sings ""Red River Valley"" which affects her greatly. The second appearance of a red fox may be linked to the spirit of her mother, who is the catalyst for her recovery.As I said, the wilderness part of Wild is the good part but unfortunately the flashbacks involving Cheryl's earlier life prove to be much less compelling. What's missing here is character development— instead we almost have a group of generic family members: The mother dying of cancer and an abusive dad from even earlier days. The sympathetic husband is a bit of a twist but he's there only to support Cheryl as she falls into a generic drug haze.In the end, ignore all the angst and focus on Cheryl's fascinating trek on the dazzling Pacific Crest Trail.",Wild

Anyways, what I am referring to with that intro is Director Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Wild"" based on Cheryl Strayed's memoir ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"". Strayed did hike the Pacific Crest Trail Highway for more than 1,000 miles to help her in grieving the loss of her mother. Reese Witherspoon walked the walk in marvelous fashion with her excellent performance as Cheryl; it's no wonder she was not strayed away from a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination. Vallee did a solid job in exhibiting Strayed's journey and all the people she meets along the way. The only not so happy valley I mean Vallee is when he showed one too many flashback scenes of Strayed's past even though it was integral to the narrative, but a yet overdone. Laura Dern was steady as Strayed's mother Bobbi, but all respect to Ms. Dern, was not dernerving I mean deserving of the Best Supporting Actress nomination it garnered. The ""Wild"" cinematography was all natuuuural, and was snubbed of an Oscar nomination. I did not get too wild about ""Wild"" but I still found it to be a very good movie that deserves a path to your movie screens. **** Good",Wild
48,alindsay-al,an average film that is hugely overrated.,5,21 January 2015,"I have heard great things about this film and I really liked the premise of this film but I must say I am upset because this film is completely average. The premise sees a woman walking a 1,100 mile walk to get over an emotional loss and find herself. Now Reese Witherspoon is a good actress and she has been Oscar nominated for this film but it must be a weak year this year as she is only alright in this film. I mean she is alright but her character just wasn't made interesting and actually her character actually did some bad things that by the end of the film you don't feel she has made up for it. Laura Dermot plays witherspoons mum and she has also been nominated but she doesn't really belong there either. She is good in the role but she is not in the film enough to impose her presence that much. Witherspoons brother and her ex husband in the story are not interesting and every person she meets on the hike are forgettable and not interesting in any kind of way. The story had great potential to be great and for a little bit it does live up to it but overall it fails. The characters just are not developed enough and our main character isn't given enough situations to make us care about her or her objective. I also feel like this film glossed over how hard the hike was and made it too easy and clean which I think could have been made more survivalist. The script is okay with some nice dialogue but just like the sentences allot of it is forgettable and just cheap swears that feel like they are just thrown in their. The style of the hike is fantastic and the cinematography of the film is great. However, this film feels so long because of the way it is filmed and I thought it was incredibly slow in a bad way. Overall this film is completely average and if you heard the buzz you may have already seen this film but I would truly advise you not too.",Wild

What if I was never redeemed?""Over the past decades Nick Hornby's novels have been adapted for the big screen successfully (About a Boy, High Fidelity). He also adapted the wonderful screenplay for An Education. His latest screenplay, Wild, is based on Cheryl Strayed's memoir who hiked over a thousand miles in the Pacific Crest Trail on her own. It is quite a fascinating tale directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers Club) and starring Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl. The Canadian born director has proved in the past that he can get great performances from his actors, and he does so once again. Witherspoon seems to be playing a similar character from the one she played in MUD. She has been through some traumatic events which have caused her some self destructive addiction problems, but we don't know what they are at first because the way that Vallee tells the story is through flashbacks as Cheryl is walking through the trail. It rewards patient viewers because despite not being able to identify with her at the beginning we are given small glimpses of her past that will later on allow us to understand why she is doing this. What is made clear from the very opening scene is that she isn't doing this simply as an adventure because she has no experience whatsoever. She is walking with way too much weight despite her small size, which also is symbolic because we soon realize that she is carrying a heavy burden herself. Wild's strength relies on Witherspoon's performance and those encounters she has along the way, but this is ultimately a road trip movie we've seen done many times before in the past (Emilio Estevez directed his father Martin Sheen in The Way a few years ago, and Emile Hirsch starred in Into the Wild both with a very similar premise). Despite the gorgeous landscape, I wasn't awed by the cinematography which kept its focus on Witherspoon's inner struggles as she walked the walk.Unlike what I've heard from most audiences, I wasn't moved by Wild. It tells a powerful story, but somehow I didn't feel that connection with the heroine of the film. Witherspoon gives a strong performance and we see her without any makeup and full of bruises from the expedition during most of the film. This was very much a physical role for her and she went all in. Laura Dern has also received a lot of acclaim for her supporting role as Cheryl's mother during the flashback scenes. This mother and daughter relationship is given a lot of importance in Wild and both actresses deliver, although I wouldn't go as far as considering them amongst my favorite of the year. They've both been nominated for their performances. The flashbacks weren't my favorite part of the film however, because I enjoyed the encounters Cheryl had during the trail. She spends most of the film walking on her own, but there are brief encounters with several other hikers along the way. Those were perhaps the most engaging moments of the film for me. They are simple encounters, but very authentic reminding us the importance of human interaction. There is a scene near the end of the film where she encounter a boy and her grandmother that is very touching. Wild covers too familiar a territory to stand out for me, but I still enjoyed it and definitely would recommend it for Witherspoon's strong lead performance. I would say that Wild isn't as much a film about self- discovery as it is about self-recovery because Cheryl is trying to recover from destructive addictions while isolating herself from society and taking a thousand mile journey across the Pacific Crest.",Wild

It follows Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl, a self destructive divorcee with no outdoor experience who makes the rash decision to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone (one of America's longest and toughest trails) in a bid to conquer her demons. With a heavy backpack and loads of willpower she reflects on her failed marriage, mothers death and downward spiral in life. The kindness of strangers helps her summon the courage she'll need to stay the course.I liked how this was edited, starting with her on the PCT chucking her hiking boots down a cliff and yelling and then with flashbacks to her childhood, her mother, her destructive trysts with men and drug abuse but all shown slowly as she is healing.Reese does a great job, I'm not a huge fan of hers but she was very good, a gritty role for her.

""Wild"" follows Cheryl on her harrowing 1,100 mile solo hike, as she faces potential and real dangers from mother nature and from fellow humans along the way.Reese Witherspoon is getting award nominations for playing Cheryl. However, I am not engaged by her performance. Her enormous backpack looks really heavy, but it seemed like the difficulty stopped there. The rest of the time, her hardships of the hike were obviously just acting, never felt real to me. It does not also help that the character she is portraying does not inspire sympathy as she was written. The way this film portrayed Cheryl, she had unrealistically over-the-top responses to regular challenges we all face as human beings. Her losses were not particularly extraordinary to push her to such unreasonable extremes of negative behavior.Laura Dern scored a surprise Oscar nomination for her very fleeting appearance here as Cheryl's mother Bobbi. In those few minutes on screen, I can already see why Cheryl was devastated by what happened to her mother. The portrayal of Ms. Dern is very effective and memorable despite its brevity. Laura Dern made more of an impact on me in those few minutes, than Witherspoon in the whole film. Dern's affecting performance was the saving grace of this film for me.The beautifully photographed desert and snow vistas aside, I did not like the way director Jean-Marc Vallee told Cheryl's story, unlike the way he handled ""Dallas Buyers Club"" last year. In that film, Matthew McConaughey's character was a homophobic sex addict, not exactly hero material. Yet the way his story was told by Vallee, we still rooted for him to get through his ordeal with AIDS. This did not happen for me in this film in Cheryl's case. I see her physical journey and her emotional journey. But the spiritual journey, which was supposed to uplift and inspire me, I did not see.Among the Oscar-nominated films this year, this is the film that I do not get what the awards buzz was about.

54,peterp-450-298716,Never thought a movie about hiking would captivate me that much.,7,4 December 2015,"""God is a ruthless bitch."" A film about someone who decides to go down the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) just to come to terms with herself after living a turbulent life. At first sight it seemed to me that this subject was a bit too feeble for creating an entertaining movie. To some extent that's true, but at the same time, this was nonetheless a touching and sometimes quite moving film. This notorious 4286 kilometer long footpath, situated in the West of the USA and running along the highest parts of the Sierra Nevada, definitely isn't for beginners. And yet Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) packed her backpack and without any preparation she started this eerie trip.Firstly you can foresee that this could be a fairly monotonous film. One individual all alone in the wild nature. Only occasionally she has brief encounters with people who cross her path. Each with their own back-story and motivation. Actually it's a bit like ""All is lost"" with Robert Redford drifting on the wide ocean in his sailboat. He was also completely alone and abandoned. Or recently you could see the expedition members in ""Everest"" who experienced a worst case scenario. They were (although it was a larger group) totally isolated on this mountaintop. You already know in advance that you'll witness how this person laboriously drags herself through a desert landscape and other wastelands, meanwhile holding monologues due to the lack of other interlocutors. And the shown images of nature are extraordinarily beautiful.What impressed me the most in ""Wild"" was Reese's acting. For me, Reese's alter ego Elle Woods still haunts her. I'll always associate her with that dumb-looking blonde who started to study law in ""Legally Blonde"" and afterwards created a stir in court. What I still can remember, are the decisive arguments she came up with and where the evidence was related to make-up and hairstyle related techniques. These trivialities made sure she won the case. And lets not forget her pink outfit for God's sake and her yapping puppy in matching clothes. And then there were these sorority girlfriends who, when counted together, wouldn't add up to a decent IQ. I always get the chronic diarrhea when watching such movies. But this stands in sharp contrast to how she performs here. A scarred woman who travels with an overloaded backpack, but also drags along a heavy burden on her shoulders. And she wants to get rid of that once and for all.Jean-Marc Vallée, who also directed the brilliant film ""Dallas Buyers Club"", managed to create a fascinating mixture of drama and humor. ""Wild"" is constantly interrupted by flashbacks in which we get to know Cheryl's mother. A pugnacious person who ,despite setbacks in her life, remains a paragon of positivism. A brilliant interpretation by Laura Dern (better known as the female archaeologist who was being chased by dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park""). She clearly passed that attitude to Cheryl. After a self-destructive life of drugs and uncontrolled sex, Cheryl tries to put her life back on track figuratively, by literally walking the PCT path. It's kind of her personal calvary in this ""road movie on foot"". A beautiful film that is alternately touching, painful and funny. A demonstration of endurance, perseverance and willpower. A film in which Reese Witherspoon knows how to keep herself perfectly upright, despite the monstrous-looking backpack that brings her off balance every time. Respect!

Therefore I was looking forward to ""Wild"", since I read it was about the journey of discovery of a single woman.Turns out, the ""single"" woman was a promiscuous divorcée and her discovery boiled down to ""whatever I did wrong, I would do it again"".The story is based on Cheryl Strayed real-life1100 miles hike on the PCT, fueled by the death of her beloved mother and her descent into despair and debauchery. Unfortunately, the movie is edited in the most annoying way, with continuous flashbacks that made me feel nauseous and far too many close-up of Reese Witherspoon. The straightforward plot was scrambled and served on screen unremittingly moving back and forward in time. We were also given many chances to ogle Witherspoon's toned abs and perk bottom while she indulged in her debauchery and drug use. Otherwise, it was her cute face filling the screen and leaving very little space for the beautiful landscape.Even if much criticized, I did not find Witherspoon's performance bad. Her character was not supposed to be sunny and easy-going; therefore her bad attitude, fear and depression were appropriate. However, I agree that her character is mostly unlikable and the only word she seems to know and use is ""F..k""... so much for her alleged level of ""sophistication"".",Wild
56,lastliberal-853-253708,Finding your strength within,9,22 July 2015,"Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern got well deserved Oscar nominations for their roles in this film. In fact, I cannot fathom how Witherspoon was denied a win.I won't fall into the trap of comparing this film to the book. The book was the best one I read last year, and I thought it unfilmable. I was surprised at how well the film managed to capture the essential elements of the book.The key was not the Pacific Coast Trail, but Cheryl Strayed's journey into self-discovery. The point where she fell to her knees in tears was the culmination of pain in her life, and the realization of her love for her mother.This is definitely a film to watch more than once.",Wild
57,jadepietro,On the Road to Find Out,7,17 January 2015,"This film is recommended.""Well, I left my happy home, To see what I could find out, I left my folk and friends, With the aim to clear my mind out.-Lyrics from Cat Stevens' On the Road to Find OutPoor Cheryl! Her life is in shambles. The loss of her mother, her crumbling marriage, and a hedonistic lifestyle send her on a journey to self-discovery in Jean-Marc Vallée's road film, Wild. Based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed (yes, another biography based on real-life events), the film may resemble a travelogue with its endless picturesque vistas and breathtaking panoramas, but center-stage is a strong performance by Reese Witherspoon as our determined and inexperienced hiker.￼Now anyone who saw 127 Hours, The Way, Never Cry Wolf, or Into the Wild knows this territory before even taking a first step. Whenever it's man vs. nature, you know who holds the upper hand. The predictability of the plot and the ongoing hardships our heroine faces seem unsurmountable, as Cheryl dispenses her inner demons on the road to self- enlightenment. Still one immediately is drawn into her world of doubt, guilt, and despair as she walks the walk for more than 1000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. We learn more about this woman through flashbacks and people she encounters along the way. ￼ Vallée lets her story slowly unfold, although large portions of Ms. Strayed's life go unexplained (her marriage, her rehab, her underlying purpose for the trip in the first place). These gaps in Nick Hornby's adapted screenplay leave some room for interpretation by the moviegoer. However, through the many voice-overs used, Cheryl's thought process is evident to the viewing audience. Added to that is the director's astute vision which skillfully layers the film with flashbacks and quick cuts to hint at her reasons. This keeps one throughly engaged throughout the film. (The editing by Martin Pensa and an uncredited Vallée is particularly effective in connecting the past with the present.) Witherspoon (also one of the movie's producers) gives a very believable portrayal of a woman trying to come to terms, both physically and emotionally, with the harsh realities of life. The actress acquits herself from her other screen personas and totally invests in her complex character. (Still, even though this is a true story, one wonders the ""why"" in all this trauma and drama...Why begin this arduous journey to redemption, particularly if one is so ill-prepared and such a novice at the sport? Where is her overall common sense? Certainly there are other means to accomplish this same goal without placing oneself into a life-or-death scenario.) Fine support is given by Thomas Sadowski as her husband, and especially, Laura Dern as Cheryl's mother, Bobbi. Their screen time is minimal but efficiently used to provide some more gravitas to the story.Wild is a rather tame but compelling retelling of yet another woman on the road to find out. Ms. Strayed may have found her inner self and her story is in good hands, thanks to a talented director and a committed actress. But moviegoers might still be searching for a bit more insight in their travels to the cinema. GRADE: B",Wild
58,Seraphion,Way less than my expectation,5,24 January 2015,"I was hoping to see something that at least equals Emille Hirsch's Into The Wild (2007). I set my expectation that high after seeing the striking similarities on many aspects. As Into The Wild was, this movie is also a true story based lone character centered journey of hiking a long path, running away and seeking an atonement for his/her self- perceived dark past of relationships with others and life mistakes. The movie actually tries to follow suit with Into The Wild's recipe of crisscrossing the story flow between the journey itself and the past. But Wild (2014) becomes boring from early on since it doesn't really have any good dramatization of the journey's accounts. The focus instead lies in dramatizing the past, but even that feels strange because it doesn't really build well into the movie as a whole due to most often being portrayed just as short flash backs with a lot of edits and cuts mid-scene to change into whispers in the journey. The acting feels just at an adequate level for me. I don't really think that this is Reese Witherspoon's best performance. But instead for me Laura Dern's performance deserve quite a credit because she can project her character well enough though it's only presented via flash backs.",Wild
59,Rob_Taylor,Dreary and depressing look into one woman's inability to deal with reality.,4,4 April 2015,"No, seriously, that is what is presented here. If you are expecting a heart-warming tale of someone finding their way after a tragedy, then look elsewhere. This is not that.At first, the movie is fairly interesting. The incompetent Cheryl decides to go on a hike along the Pacific Coast Trail for reasons we do not know. The interest stems from the flashbacks which slowly reveal the cause of her walk.However, once revealed, the movie seems determined to then ruin the rest of itself by continuing to foist flashback after flashback on us for no good reason until you are sick of them.What might have been a dark start followed by an uplifting tale instead continues to be dark and depressing as hell. The movie also does itself no favours by portraying almost every man Cheryl meets as a stereotypical sex predator with just one thing on their mind. In fact, when Cheryl meets another female hiker, she throws her arms around her as if she has just found the only other normal person in the world.There is no sense of redemption of the main character throughout this film. Only at the very end, do we get a couple of minutes of voice-over explaining how Cheryl has forgiven herself etc. etc. Voice-over... really? You couldn't show us that change during the film? You had to tell us it was all better at the end? I'm sorry, but this film misses its mark by a long way. When you add in the fact that Reese Witherspoon never looks like she's been out in the desert for days on end, the whole thing becomes a real train-wreck.SUMMARY: Dull and tiresome to watch. Excessive misandry. Fails to engage the viewer or make the main character sympathetic. Best avoided.RECOMMENDATION: Watch Tracks (2013) instead. Or 127 Hours. Or Into the Wild. All are better than this.",Wild

Although Julianne Moore has taken the race by storm, Witherspoon is still a viable runner-up, dirtying down and revealing great strength and vulnerability. Vallee does a great job at getting us in her head and the film is at its best when it's simple problem solving. However, Nick Hornby's script is a gift and a curse. It's got an endearing mean-spirited personality and fond affection for great music, but it's too episodic for its own good despite the scattered flashbacks. Not every character can introduce themselves well and it stumbles most on the last hurdle with a mother and son near the end. I really wanted to connect to this and although it's has edge and insight into the human condition it's too familiar to savour. It's very good but falls short of its predecessor. 7/10",Wild
61,Screen_Blitz,Reese Witherspoon is tremendous in his poignant biopic of self-discovery and tragedy,7,8 June 2017,"Reese Witherspoon is not an actress typically known for taking on serious roles, with most of her filmography dealing with comedies. Although the actress has had a few non-comedic roles in the past, most of them are not well remembered by this point. This biopic based on the emotionally riveting memoir by Cheryl Strayed, a woman who set out on a life-changing journey in 1995, grants Witherspoon with the grand opportunity to expand upon her acting muscles and expose a rarely open area in her talent. It is a biopic centered on a woman plaguing with tragedy, grief, hope, and redemption; and the story follows as this woman ventures on a quest at puts her physical and emotional stability to the test. Although the film may not reach the heights of cinematic mastery in terms of storytelling nor does it strike for anything special, there is plenty of talent to be witness in its near two- hour runtime. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, this movie follows the true story of Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon), a twenty-something year old woman strained by her rocky marriage with her husband Paul (played by Thomas Sadoski) and troubled by her dark past including the death of her mother (played by Laura Dern). Searching for hope, Cheryl sets out on an 1,100 mile hike from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Oregon where she discovers her inner being, while placing herself in path that will put on a physical and emotional endurance. The story of Cheryl Strayed is fascinating, especially when he brings up memories of the Chris McCandless story (whether you read the biography or watched the film 'Into the Wild') which took place just a few years prior to the events in this biopic. The film however, is not empty of dull moments which are likely to alienate viewers with low patience. The story here focuses on a woman who put herself on a collision course with self-discovery in attempt to tear away from her harrowing past which involved her abusive father, the untimely death of her mother, and her failed marriage. Along the way, she is forced to deal with the punishing atmosphere of the deserts while suffering from the scarcity of food and water. The story is frequently intertwined with flashbacks showcasing the happy days and dark days of her past, a storytelling method opens up to both the best and the worst of Nick Hornby's screenplay. While the flashbacks of her past greatly contribute to the three-dimensional construction of her character as well as the emotional backbone, the editing of these scene transitions can occasionally serve as a burden to the pacing. Director Jean-Marc Vallee keeps things moving, but at a slow momentum. Luckily, this does nothing to take away from the uncompromising performance by Reese Witherspoon. The actress shines in the role with astounding emotional resonance as well as exercising both of her physical and emotional range. Regardless of whether she is likable or not, it is hard not to sympathize with the heartbreak she suffers from and hopes of escaping her life of pain. Witherspoon's performance greatly pays off when she is sharing the screen with Laura Dern who is stupendous in the role of her late mother, who's screen time is limited in flashbacks. The relationship between the two shoots for an absorbing emotional spark that greatly fits the bill, and when the story dives into her death and the grief that follows, it safely avoids the pitfalls of sentimental contrivance. Now don't feel like this movie is a thing of darkness, there are some happy moments to be sparred. Wild is a poignant, yet inspiring biographical drama that shines with an riveting performance by its lead starlet and benefits with touching the heart with its powerful story. The film is not set to impress nor fascinate everyone, particularly those who are more inclined to faster-paced stories or something less melancholy. Nonetheless, it is filled with talent that should not be ignored.",Wild

Wild is based on a true story of Cheryl Strayedand is directed by Jean Marc Valle who credit includes the Dallas Buyers Club and Young Victoria to name a few. Similar to Dallas Buyers' Club, Vallee chooses the biography of a common person who changes her life with an adventure.

Nevertheless, the cinematography is splendid with astounding art direction. Dialogues are nice. Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are the reason you should watch the film.

Dealing with issues in her past and what her life has become, Cheryl (Reese Witherspoon) decides to walk it out on the Pacific Crest Trail. These kind of personal journeys make for good dramatic fodder and are excellent star vehicles. Reese Witherspoon gives one of her best performances ever, but at the end I felt underwhelmed. Throughout the entire film there are no startling revelations or crises that require our main character to rethink anything or make meaningful change. Even the way the film unfolds is rather cliché and ordinary, relying heavily on flashbacks to flesh out Cheryl's character and story. Of course, given the talent behind the film everything is artfully composed and presented, but to little effect. The cinematography and natural scenery was beautiful and the score was pleasant to listen to, but I was left mostly unaffected by everything I saw since it all felt so familiar and unspectacular. There was one single moment towards the end that moved me in a special way, and that was when a little boy sings Red River Valley. While I would be foolish to dismiss this film out of hand simply because its story felt cliché and boring (at times), I can't say that it's a great film either.

There are various reasons why this works.Director Jean-Marc Vallée provides the right balance of hiking adventure with flashbacks while keeping the inner-dialogue to just the right minimum, ensuring the movie is more than just a narration.Likewise, Witherspoon easily takes on the challenge of maintaining viewer interest while being in almost every frame of the movie. She comes off as a likeable protagonist who faces occasional drama but is mostly engaged in the day-to-day challenges of being out of her comfort zone.The film has a couple of scenes where danger is anticipated but not realized. In sticking to the true story, there is even greater impact and surprise by avoiding the worst possible outcome.Another notable performance, even if rather brief, is Laura Dern as Cheryl's mother who is shown in various flashbacks.

While this is a more layered film involving a much wider array of different people with the plot switching both time and location to delve into the main character's life from childhood to present day. Reese Witherspoon is never anything other than perfectly tenable in what is her film, while Laura Dern is exemplary in her slight, yet absolutely vital role. The direction is plain, simple, and solid allowing the constantly changing, and very stunning, locations to speak for themselves.

67,RforFilm,A Non-Linear Path and Strong Acting Make Wild a Trip Worth Embarking On,9,13 January 2015,"Though I can't say that I've gone through this kind of experience, I certainly know people that would love to start their lives over again. Perhaps the dreams they were originally seeking weren't as good as they turned out or they hit a roadblock that's put a halt on their plans. Regardless on what they went though, they want to move on with a rebirth of some sort. To change one's persona depends on what kind of person one is. For someone that already had a lot of responsibility, that may just involve going on a fitness regime or a newly decorated home.Those that have very few priorities are going to need something more crucial. In the case of some, that requires traveling. I've said before that everyone has a little bit on wanderlust within. They have to look at a new landscape to get a new perspective on themselves. How they travel is completely up to the person about to make this journey. I would rather travel first class, but I understand those that want a little more challenge. A hiking or walking trip is the best option here. One woman with little wilderness experience takes that challenge in Wild. In 1995, a young woman Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) has gone through a lot that has put her into a bad path. She was raised by her young mom Bobbi Grey (played by Laura Dern) who taught her to always be positive about life, even when everything seems bad (including that the father was an abusive alcoholic). She ends up passing away from Cancer in her forties which puts Cheryl into a state of drugs and sleeping around. This prompts her husband leaving her and without a clue with where to go with her depression.She decides to hike that Pacific Crest Trail by herself from Southern California to Oregon. Knowing that accomplishing this trek could give her the rebirth needed, she buys a ton of camping equipment, packs up at a motel and sets off into the desert. Since she is by herself, this gives her all time to her thoughts and memories of growing up. She occasionally comes across other hikers who give her tips on what to see and even provide a hot meal, though this is clearly Cheryl's journey to make. The hot sun and snowy environment push her to extremes she could have never imagined.I will make this clear that this is no wilderness survival story; she's never in true danger and is never too far from civilization. This is more like a road trip story. And as these kind of movies go, Wild is a very good road trip to take upon. The surroundings give director Jean- Marc Vallée (also directed Dallas Buyers Club) all the opportunity to show off the beautiful landscapes of the path. Dusty California and the evergreen Oregon looks magnificent here. Something tells me that the Army-Navy stores are going to be selling more backpacks this year. Reese Witherspoon clearly went though a lot for this character and it shows. She's relatable in her situation and pulls off one of my favorite female performances of the year (2014 I mean). Laura Dern is a likable mother that really sad to see go when the movie reveals it.What separates Wild from other road trip stories is that this has a non-linear structure. This could have been the movie's fatal flaw, but works really well as each flashback lets you know more about Cheryl and her personal problems. This is something that Man of Steel should have done before. I'll give this nine hiking backpacks out of ten. There is plenty in this story to like, though those expecting something more traditional are not going to find it here. It's non linear flow and constant thoughts from Reese are the thing to hold it back from making it mainstream, but I think most people will be open to it. If you can't make this hike, then at least hike yourself somewhere to watch Wild.",Wild
68,Quietb-1,Wild aka stupidly large backpack.,5,22 December 2014,"Is Reece Witherspoon wild or in the wild? You decide. Here she plays a girl on a journey to find herself by walking. She didn't get good advice as her load was too much to carry and her equipment was incompatable.Hard to believe she wouldn't try the tent and stove before going on the journey. Perhaps the backpack was that large because she needed to carry her hair and makeup person on the trail. If she had walked East instead of North she could have met up with Laura Dern's dad walking to Nebraska? Laura Dern does a good job as her mother. Reece will get the pulling off of a toenail award from the Academy of Chiropodists.Problems with the movie include her biggest problem on the trail was her smell.

69,bryank-04844,'Wild' is a film you should definitely see.,7,12 August 2015,"Director Jean-Marc Vallee is becoming one of the finer filmmakers of this modern age. Even though his resume is a short one, each one of his films has been fantastic. Vallee is one of those directors who does not stick to one particular genre, but rather goes after different stories in different time periods and genres. And while he might not be as drastic as Stanley Kubrick in this fashion, the comparison is still there.With films like 'C.R.A.Z.Y', which was a lovely coming-of-age story to 'Dallas Buyers Club', which focused on small bit of history on the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, to the historical set film 'Young Victoria', which brings us to 'Wild', the wilderness adventure set in the 90s. All of these films center on raw, genuine, and strong characters, but are all in different settings. Each of these characters in these different films have to come to terms with something from their past and deal with them overcoming some personal demons.Based on the best-selling memoir by Cheryl Strayed, but adapted to a screenplay by Nick Hornby ('High Fidelity', 'About A Boy'), 'Wild' follows a young woman named Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) as she hikes the 1,100 mile journey up the west coast alone to overcome a series of tragedies in her life. Strayed (a name she took on after her drug fueled years and divorce) was a smart and beautiful young woman, who had tons of friends and her life pretty much mapped out. Despite her mother (played by the impressive Laura Dern) being a few abusive relationships, Cheryl and her mother had a close bond.But an unfortunate illness caused Cheryl's mother to pass early in life, causing Cheryl to nosedive into a wall of heroine and sex with anyone other than her nice husband (Thomas Sadoski). The film starts off with Cheryl in the middle of her hike, trying to overcome some physical issues with her journey. From this moment on, we get flashbacks of her life that brings us back to the beginning of her dangerous voyage alone. In addition, we see glimpses of some of the key moments of Cheryl's life with her mother and brother, growing up, dealing with her mother's passing, and her drug binge, which ultimately leads her to take this trek to become the girl her mother knew her to be.And Vallee captures each moment perfectly with a very emotional and deep tone. But like Vallee's other films, there are quite a bit of humorous moments throughout. This story of family tribulations and survival go hand in hand with this very genuine mother-daughter story and both Witherspoon and Dern play it flawlessly and are both award worthy performances. Witherspoon completely threw herself in this role and does not shy away from any of the drug abuse or sexual encounters she has. You've never seen Witherspoon like this. And even though she does some deplorable things, her charisma and will keep us rooting for her in the long run. There is no doubt that you will come to love and cry with Witherspoon throughout the film.Vallee has conjured up a brilliant cast and crew to give us a very emotional yet redeeming film where we first meet our main character, she is not doing well, but by the end, she is quite amazing. Despite a few usual pacing problems with the flashback gimmick, 'Wild' is a film you should definitely see.",Wild

71,Likes_Ninjas90,"As a new chapter in Reese Witherspoon's career, Wild is a positive step towards the future",7,31 January 2015,"Wild is an adaptation of Cheryl Strayed's memoir about her 1100-mile hike through the Pacific Crest Trail. The film shares metafictional parallels with its star Reese Witherspoon. While promoting the film she discussed her dissatisfaction with recent film roles, specifically the lack of strong female characters, which is timely given the recent discourse surrounding the Oscars' lack of diversity. Her discontent encouraged her to form her own production company Pacific Standard and develop the films Gone Girl and now Wild, both of which she produced and feature edgy, troubled females at the heart of their stories.If Strayed's journey was self-discovery, or finding her best-self as the film describes it, Witherspoon's own pursuit is similar by distancing herself from the Hollywood studio system and taking ownership of her career by working in the independent circuit. While sometimes labelled America's sweetheart and working as a comedic actress in lightweight comedies, the best roles of her career are darker, more subversive ones like Freeway (1996) and Alexander Payne's Election (1999), which deliberately twist her upbeat, bubbly personality. At thirty-eight years old, playing Strayed is arguably her grittiest, most physically taxing role and one of her best, justifying her decision to chase the film rights.A major advantage working outside the studio system is removing potential glossiness. French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers Club) and his camera crew used one hand-held camera and filmed Witherspoon through various parts of Oregon. The effect of a small, intimate shoot is dissolving our comprehension of reality and staged filmmaking. The attention to detail, such as its star's insistence on not wearing makeup, is strong. The track scenes, including the stumbles, the cuts and bruises and dirty clothes, don't appear choreographed or preplanned either. There are funny stories that Witherspoon wasn't allowed to touch the film's props before a scene, spent real time learning to assemble a tent while being filmed, and carried all the camping tools in her heavy pack nicknamed Monster.When Vallee and cinematographer Yves Belanger place the camera on Witherspoon's face, her eyes silently provide great feeling and expression of her vulnerability and insecurities. Witherspoon copies Strayed's appearance closely, except Strayed is taller than the film's diminutive star who is only five-foot-one. While not without humour, her mentally and sometimes physically stripped down performance soars as she embodies her subject and dissolves her trademark quirkiness and comic overtones. Under Vallee the film's only mistake is failing to nail the pace of the film, which sags heavily in the final quarter.Apart from a voice over of Cheryl's self-doubt and fears and quick cuts to splice up scenes, Wild's trek scenes use minimal stylisation which helps hide the artifice of filmmaking. Resisting recognisable stars outside of Witherspoon and Laura Dern for example makes the locals Cheryl meets seem authentic, as does their naturalistic dialogue. Given the film intersperses its track scenes with flashbacks to Cheryl's past, the film's shape is not as minimalist or experimental as All is Lost but nor as consciously artistic or formal as the Australian film Tracks. It falls somewhere in the middle. Nick Hornby's (An Education, About a Boy) screenplay predictably dramatises conventional themes like individualism and personal growth but Wild is more interesting as a study of gender and femininity. The film is both a road movie and a collection of dark memories, building a vivid portrait of a personal crisis left behind. The premise of the film is the trek but the plot and depth of character are told through intercutting flashbacks to Cheryl's relationship with her mother (Dern). Cheryl feels not only distanced from her memory but disappointed and embarrassed by her treatment of her mother and her own promiscuous nature when she cheated on her husband and dabbled with heroin.The narrative's most tense scenes depict involve Cheryl's insecurity around men and as the story unravels we understand with insight these tenuous feelings and discomfort. A night time ride with a truck driver starts as a fearsome encounter of apparent innuendo, another man is condescending by mistaking her for a hobo and she is watched ominously by two persistent creepers. The film is very effective in immersing us inside Cheryl's headspace and sharing her fearful perceptions of these strangers. It feels unique for a film with a major star to be divorced from either male friendship or a love interest.In those parts of the film where she feels threatened there's a sense the film is almost like a fairytale story of a woman travelling through the woods. It's not a conventional redemption story but one which comes to the conclusion that the mistakes we've made are no longer regrets but pivotal for leading us to breakthrough moments. Destruction becomes a form of creation and you must fall before you can walk again. While this sounds like a familiar variation on individualism, the depiction of self-destructive behaviour through sexuality and drugs is mature and uncompromised, which rejuvenates the content. As a new chapter in Reese Witherspoon's career, Wild is a positive step towards the future.",Wild

So began a solo 1,100 mile journey on the trail. The adventure, a true story of a modern day vision quest, became as much an inward journey as it was into the wilderness. Cheryl was a stranger to both. Reese Witherspoon and the makers of this film adeptly bring Cheryl's story to life. Her story is revealing, raw and personal. She let so many people down, including her mom, ex-husband and herself, that she has a great deal of difficulty moving forward.

What is that all about? It's happening a lot. It seems to be that a small number of ""haters"" love coming to IMDb to express their dislike for a film. Upvoters don't feel the need, so it results in an imbalance in the voting. You look at the reviews of a good film, and all the initial reviews are negative! Really, it's a major flaw in the IMDb review/voting system. What it means is that you cannot trust the voting on the IMDb review pages.Anyway, this is a good film. It's a pilgrimage movie about a young woman who hikes the Pacific Crest Trail for three months. She is struggling with a number of problems, so the hiking is a way for her to work out these problems and become a stronger, more self-reliant person. Yes, she is doing this to find herself. She starts off quite weak, and much of the dramatic tension of the film is based on wondering whether she will quit or be hurt along the way.She has various adventures that reveal her character. This is a remarkable woman, so it is a pleasure to get to know her better. Through flashbacks, we are also shown her happy memories and her sad memories, and why she has demons to be exorcised. It's only after she has suffered somewhat do we get to see the real ugly stuff.The acting of Reese Witherspoon and also Laura Dern is astonishingly good. The direction and writing were superb. And of course the scenery is gorgeous. If you have any sense of adventure in you, you'll take a close look at the Pacific Crest Trail.I found this to be a spellbinding, cathartic movie. Highly recommended.",Wild
76,oOoBarracuda,"""Never been a time where there was a fork in my road""",9,25 May 2016,"I certainly watched this movie at the right time in my life. Going through a breakup, there is nothing I want more than to abandon life and immerse myself in the world of nature. Running away and being self-sufficient has always had a unique appeal to human beings. The camping and hiking industries have flourished well beyond the time when people were living in houses and have urbanized. The 2014 film by Jean-Marc Vallée takes an unflinching look at just how all- consuming one's relationship to nature can be. Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are exceptional in their roles as the mother/daughter relationship acting as the driving force of the film. The tailspin one goes into once they lose their only ally in life is an interesting psychological phenomenon to explore, which the film Wild explores in depth.Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) has lost everything. after her mother's death (Laura Dern), the breakdown of her marriage, and her downward spiral into drugs and destruction; Cheryl has little hope to turn her life around. Desperate to return purpose to her existence, Cheryl has the idea to pack up hike the over 2,000 mile Pacific Crest Trail alone. An inexperienced hiker, Cheryl encounters all the hardships of experienced hikers with the ignorance of a novice. Setting off on the trail, Cheryl composes a pack that is so heavy she has to roll over on her stomach to get it on her back. Along the way, enjoying the seclusion and the occasional company a hiker's life provides, Cheryl logs her travels and her feelings helping her deal with the death of her mother and end of her marriage. Cheryl chooses to travel the journey of the trail, and her grief alone in order to rediscover the meaning of her life. What a beautiful and well-made movie! The natural lighting used in this movie will hypnotize audiences with its raw depiction of Cheryl's intense journey. The sounds are amped up in this film, which is an excellent way to submerge the audience inside Cheryl's powerful journey. Nothing could have been better than the audible internal monologue of Cheryl's to illustrate for audiences how deeply engrained her struggles were. Each memory was fluidly intertwined with the point of the journey Cheryl was on. This proved to be a brilliant decision for Vallée because the power it conveyed was unable to be achieved in any other way. The acting was also just as raw as the story with Witherspoon proving to be able to handle the uncouth character with ease. Laura Dern is as exceptional as the abused mother, just as she is exceptional in every role she takes on. Why isn't Laura Dern in everything? She has never disappointed as an actress and it has always baffled me as to why her Hollywood star doesn't shine brighter. I could have done without the ripping off of the toenail just as I sat down with my vegan pizza, but other than that, Wild was a fantastic film that should be seen by all. The power push of Wild is its focus on the relationship between Cheryl Strayed and her mother, Bobbi. The audiences witness Bobbi being abused by Cheryl's father. Cheryl is even shown as a small child caring for her mother's wounds after an especially vicious attack at the hands of her father. When Bobbi finally leaves her husband, she devotes herself to her children, and her children to her. Always being especially close to her mother, Cheryl is devastated at Bobbi's cancer diagnosis. When she lives out a significantly shorter time span than doctors anticipated, Cheryl is unable to deal with watching her mother's declining health. Upon Bobbi's passing, Cheryl abandons her ambitions and goals and desperately seeks solace in drug use and unprotected sex. As her subsequent marriage deteriorates due to her drug use and cheating, Cheryl's life is even further turned upside down. Cheryl and her mother were best friends and the only true allies for each other. Losing her friend and rock, Cheryl needed the isolation of nature to bring her back to herself. Wild does an extraordinary job of exposing Cheryl's channeled energy and telling her story with reverence.",Wild
77,billygoat1071,A Rewarding Struggle,9,6 February 2015,"Wild is based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed about her lone hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey is meant to be an escape from her personal problems and possibly rehabilitating herself from a troubling past. It expresses these feelings thoroughly; at every turn, there has to be a reminder of what she's been through, but also deals with a potential danger in this hike. The movie lives up to its sentiment, the pain and obstacles that the story goes through feel genuine and it leaves us such a rewarding experience. There are some parts that can feel a little uneven, but its spirit stays intact, enduring what the movie is meant to be.There are several conflicts in this hike. Firstly is how inexperienced Strayed is in the wilderness, trying to reach her destination with a heavy backpack, tight shoes, raw meals, and even faces anything that could possibly harm her, including wild animals and strangers that appears to her as a threat. The other is basically remembering the past of losing her mother and her addiction out of depression. The main point here is how she deals with these problems; the flashbacks may be just any other drama, but it helps clearing out her motivations and fleshing out who she is. Though, the emotions are more genuine when she is simply isolated, helpless from any conflict until she learns lifting herself back up, literally and metaphorically.It carefully lingers at how difficult to proceed this walk which makes her seemingly small actions look like a truly serious risk. The camera just lets the audience experience the same feeling of pain and exhaustion on what she is doing. Reese Witherspoon naturally pictures the vital parts of Strayed's emotional and physical struggles, while building a full character along the trek. But the movie doesn't always have to be tough, whenever it stops into places with people, there is a real pleasant feeling around, especially when she is just expressing her thoughts to whoever she just met.There are a some flaws that are worth mentioning, specifically when it occasionally takes turn to a far different direction later on, somewhat abandoning the consistent emotion it accomplished. The very last part also ended up verbalizing the entire theme, kind of dropping the poetic intentions. But they didn't outweigh much of its merits. Because no matter what happened there, Wild is still a journey that earned something satisfyingly heartfelt. Most of the credit may go to Reese Witherspoon as she thoughtfully carries the whole film. Even when it sort of stumbles in some parts, the movie still delivers the story with sincerity and real emotions that made it this great.",Wild
78,TheSquiss,#Reese Witherspoon stripped bare & exposed on a journey to find a reason to live,7,14 January 2015,"When Cheryl Strayed's (Reese Witherspoon) life has a good go at crashing and burning, largely due to her own poor decisions, she packs a rucksack and takes a 1,000 mile walk along the Pacific Crest Trail to, as she puts it, ""find out how to become the girl my mother loved."" Alone and woefully ill prepared for the trek, both physically and emotionally, hers is a journey through an unforgiving landscape of discovery, pain and hope.Adapted by Nick Hornby from Cheryl Strayed's own biographical account of her journey, Wild: From Lost to Found On the Pacific Crest Trail, and directed my Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club), Wild is the darker sibling of 2010's The Way. But whereas The Way was a gentle, almost spiritual journey of a man making a conscious decision to complete his son's failed trek, Wild is a desperate attempt by a floundering woman to claw back something resembling life and peace.Though Reese Witherspoon won her Oscar for Walk the Line, I don't believe she has ever been better than here, stripped bare, exposed and raw. And, no, I'm not talking about the nudity or sex scenes. If you find those remotely titillating you have a serious issue with emotional connection. She has wiped off the make up, torn off the happy-go-lucky girl-next door persona that has carried her through countless rom-coms and hammered us with a performance that makes us want to shake her fiercely one moment and hug her the next.Vallée has crafted a touching film that doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of heroin, promiscuity and a twitching finger that frequently hits the self-destruct button. But whilst Vallée implies the level of unpleasantness in in Cheryl's life, he avoids laboring the point, largely through the use of quickly edited flashbacks and segues from present to various pasts. It is a device that keeps us onside but is also the biggest failing with Wild.There are too many hints that are not fully explained, too many avenues glanced at but not fully explored. Occasionally there are scenes, particularly the frogs on the seeping bag, that were presumably significant in Strayed's book but are left dangling so as to be almost irrelevant. Cheryl's relationship with her brother is left as an unexplored afterthought and there is altogether too much unfinished business. The conclusion, which should give hope or at least a sense of satisfaction, is rattled though and lost as if Vallée is anxious to attain a sub-two-hour film at all costs.But despite the niggles, Wild is a film of starkness and beauty with vistas that are breathtaking and pander to the wanderlust that bubbles fiercely just below the surface of this particular viewer.I need a copy of the soundtrack and I need to walk for a very long time.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Wild
79,davidgee,A walk on the not-too-wild side,6,24 January 2015,"Another biopic. They're coming in bunches this winter. Reese Witherspoon's performance - convincing and appealing - is reminiscent of her role as Mrs Johnny Cash. For me there was a problem with Nick Hornby's script, which drip-feeds the back-story through the movie - her mother's death, her decline into drink and drugs and reckless sex. I would have preferred a more 'linear' treatment: her bad times in a single chunk, leading up to her decision to break free and try to sort herself out. Also, there's no transitional moment. You don't feel that she has achieved Redemption or even Catharsis, although I guess she's a bit less messed-up by the end of her ""pilgrimage"". The final-reel Cheryl could easily have slipped back into her bad old ways (I hope she didn't). Overall, this is no more spectacular than one of those TV travelogues about 21st-century Man (woman) out in the primeval Wilderness - and not too primeval, with trekking signs and lodges and post-offices along the way.",Wild
80,MattBrady099,"The girl who walked 1,100 miles for hope",6,28 January 2015,"Cheryl Strayed: ""I have only another 300 miles left to walk. I'm desperate for it to be over. I'm terrified too. When I'm done, I'll only have two dimes to my name, but I'll have to start living. I'm nowhere near ready.""The story is about Cheryl Strayed has she lost all hope. After years of reckless, destructive behavior, she makes a rash decision. With absolutely no experience, driven only by sheer determination, Cheryl hikes more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. WILD powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddens, strengthens, and ultimately heals her.Well since it's award season and a lot of award worthy movies are coming (Really fast, I mean my lord there's loads) and this movie is nominated for some as well. Wild is directed by the same guy who made the best movie of 2013 (In my opinion) Dallas Buyers Club that's the movie and while I think that film is one of his best, Wild comes second in mind because Wild is pretty damn good film.Reese Witherspoon like always gives her best in any movie and in this there's no difference, in this movie she pulls off a smooth, charming and her best performance in her career. To those who think that Reese Witherspoon character in this film is all Hollywood and perfect and hot looking in this, actually no, he character get's dirty, her damn toe nails comes bleeding off in such a brutal way and that's what I like about that, because the movie shows that when you go off for a very long and I do mean long hike you don't come out of it with no scratch on you and this movie shows that. Witherspoon is one of those actress that I liked from the very beginning and I'm talking about right at the start of her movies, and still today she still gives and great and well Oscar worthy performances. Yeah she did some bad movie has well, but these good ones as well and this is one of them.The directing from Jean-Marc Vallee was super spot on, I mean this guy can really direct a story telling movie just like Buyers Club. Good work Jean- Marc Vallee.For nick picks that I have for the movie I have some like: The movie doesn't tell you much about her character and normally I like those kind of things where as a viewer myself can peace the puzzle myself to know her character, but if your going to do that it really takes brilliant writing to pull that off and don't get me wrong I'm not saying that the writing is god awful or anything like that, but what I'm trying to say is that movie kept to much away from her character so to be honest at times I didn't know what she was doing at times and the movie wants me to connect to that but I don't know why she did because I don't know much of her. But then later on all the answers came flooding in and that's when I finally got it.Wild overall has great performances from Witherspoon and Laura Dern, the cinematography is so gorgeous to look at in this movie and the directing has I said before was done extremely good. Wild may not be your type of film and that's fine, but for me I thought it was pretty well made.",Wild

At the beginning she is an abused woman, is grieving the loss of her mother and seeking a new chapter in her life. She seeks to walk 1100 miles to discover nature and along the way discovers much more. She discovers the inner strength. The story goes back and forth to her past and present. The landscape is tough as this city gal discovers the secrets to being rugged. At times it is a bit long but overall this movie is positive and will give you hope.

82,ArchonCinemaReviews,Unremarkable events spur white woman to make extraordinary journey,5,23 January 2015,"Wild is like Eat, Pray, Love but swap out food and religion for a thousand mile hike and swap divorce for heroin addiction.Wild is a chronicle of one woman's hike of over a thousand miles across the desert of the Pacific Crest Trail as a way to recover physically and emotionally.Reese Witherspoon stars as Cheryl, the destructive woman who upon losing everything and facing certain emotional crisis decides to undertake a arduous hike, without any experience. Along the hike she discovers strangers that provide solace and enlightenment but also the time alone sheds light on the difficult parts of her past that propelled her into this rash decision.My comparison of Wild to Eat, Pray, Love is not a compliment by any stretch though Wild is infinitely more palatable than Elizabeth Gilbert's novel. A white woman on the brink of an emotional breakdown, having undergone rather average emotional strain, goes on a journey of self-discovery and then makes bank by writing a best selling novel that is adapted to film.Through mainly flashbacks and voice-overs, we learn just what Cheryl is running from. And, the audience will surely think 'hrmphwell that doesn't seem too extraordinary and your destructive troubles are kind of all your fault."" Of course, each individual deals with grief, identity, love and loss their own way but most of the problems Cheryl encounters are completely of her own doing. Further, by the end of Wild she doesn't seem that much better, there is no profound moment of transformation – she simply seems a bit more put together than when she started.Of course, those critiques are primarily attributed to the journey of the real Cheryl Strayed. Perhaps with the adaptation to film, a lot of the profound introspective analysis of life and lyricism of prose is lost. The film itself is fine but not extraordinary with a solid but not outstanding performance by Witherspoon. Perhaps if the character Cheryl was more at her wits-end I would have been wow-ed.Please check out our website for more reviews of all the recent releases and award nominees.",Wild
83,bbewnylorac,A really good film,7,23 January 2015,"I don't think Reese Witherspoon is quite the right person to play Cheryl Strayed. I like her, but here she is a little too much the Hollywood star for me -- check out that blow-dried hair. And her clothes, shoes and makeup are too neat and clean for someone who's spent months outdoors. Having said that, I must say that Witherspoon is fully committed to the role and does pretty well. Particularly towards the end of the movie, her performance is lovely. I think the strength of Wild is in the script by novelist Nick Hornby, the supporting cast, and most of all the accomplished, confident direction by Jean-Marc Vallee, who also directed the great Dallas Buyers Club. In Wild, some people have criticised the continual flashbacks that Cheryl has, as being intrusive, but I felt they served to nicely break up the monotony of watching someone walking. The flashbacks also made sense as portraying Cheryl working through her grief as she walks. She was very close to her mother, and so many things she encounters on the trail remind her of before and after her Mum died. After getting away from drugs, promiscuity and her broken marriage, she finally has time, on this walk, to rake over her life. Normally the metaphor of the fox she comes across that embodies the spirit of her mother would have been a bit twee, but it wasn't overwhelming in this film, and in the end it was moving. The movie has many other interesting aspects. The farmer she encounters in the first few weeks of the walk at first could either turn out to be a psycho killer or a saviour, and it's fascinating to realise that she has no choice but to trust him. The actor who plays her former husband does a great job. He and Cheryl still have a loving relationship, it's just that, as she admits, she badly messed up their marriage. And Laura Dern is incredible as Cheryl's free spirited yet very strong and caring mother, whose life was cut short by an appalling cancer illness. The character is warm, intelligent, sensitive and loving. No wonder Cheryl misses her.",Wild
84,scottshak_111,Extraordinary feat! Exceptional stuff!,8,1 April 2015,"Wild is downright wild. The title insinuates so many things; it couldn't be more justified. The restless state inside the head of a woman, who has encountered a recent tragedy, the aftermath of that catastrophe, the wilderness she resorts to for recovering herself - everything indicative of the apposite title of the flick. Wild is a movie of self-discovery through an ordeal of hiking.The movie digs in to explore human emotions, the commotion in a sane head that could victimize even the boldest soul. It skims on the concept of human attachment, frivolity, grief and repentance.There is only so much that a heart could take. A time rushes in when it topples you off the sync. You are no longer living and you aren't dead either. Wild takes a dive into the life of Cheryl, the protagonist with a broken past, who inflamed by her deeds embarks on a hiking expedition across the PCT. Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl superbly. Her face dons Cheryl's gravity brilliantly. She is brave, she is dramatic and she is on a path of redemption. Also, she is really angry and you can literally hear her talk!Thanks to an exceptional feat in direction by Jean-Marc Vallee as he lets you listen to her thoughts, just like you would listen to yours on a journey so rough.Wild is also carved with brilliant drama. Hands down top-notch! There are so many moments in the movie that simply shatter you to pieces. Cheryl's grieving process is intermingled with imagery from the past. At some instances, different frames are deliberately run in a fleeting manner, and then unraveled gradually at a later stage to complete its story. This type of direction and editing is downright phenomenal! The screenplay is also drenched with emotional vibes that compel you to think. Overall a sensational movie that can't be missed.",Wild
85,Okonh0wp,Excellent picture from Jean-Marc Vallee,10,1 February 2015,"""Wild"" is based on the autobiographical novel of Cheryl Strayed who set out to hike the Pacific Coast Trail when her mom passing away at the age of 45. Strayed was not a hiking enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination but rather a lost soul who didn't know what else to do when sexual promiscuity and drugs didn't cure her of the void in her life.Although the film is populated by all sorts of colorful characters who Strayed meets on her journey, it's essentially a survivalist film in the vein of ""Into the Wild"" and ""127 Hours."" This film, however, is set apart by its highly praiseworthy fluidity between flashbacks and the present.Even though Strayed is in contact with other people at many points throughout the film, the film does an excellent job of showing that Strayed is still very much alone. In particular, Strayed has to remain on guard as an unaccompanied woman on a trail with guys, some of whom might have gone long stretches since seeing a woman. Interestingly enough, the film plays with the concept that all guys are creepy predators as the first dubious person she encounters turns out to be someone she can trust at face value.Among the characters she encounters, the most important are those she leaves behind including her best friend Aime, her brother Lief, her estranged husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski from ""The Newsroom"") and the inescapable image of her recently departed mother Bobbi. Interestingly enough, the flashbacks don't necessarily portray an entirely happy home. One gets the sense that the narrator only appreciated her mother in adulthood and her regret was that by then it was too late to fully enjoy her.Reese Witherspoon previously won an Oscar for ""Walk the Line"" but this is a much more challenging adult role for her as she's unable to hide behind an accent or musical number. It's not the most dazzling role I've seen this year, but it's an admirable step towards maturity for this actress. One might see the previous sentence as belittling to an actress who's 35 years old, but Witherspoon's ex-husband, Ryan Phillipe, recently retired from acting at the age of 35, and I get the sense that Witherspoon is someone who will be improving over the long haul.One complaint about the film is Strayed's closing sentiment that the endpoint toward her journey was that years later she would get married again and have a kid which struck me as unnecessarily gift-wrapping the film with the standard ""kids/marriage"" happy ending that Hollywood loves to go with. The problem is that the film had a powerful message about self-reliance that felt kind of sanded off. I wasn't opposed to seeing the character get married at the end, but the the line about kids and marriage becoming the closing line left a bad taste in my mouth.",Wild
86,bobbobwhite,Skank Alert!,4,29 December 2014,"Interesting topic for a self-discovery film that was done very badly. Way too many Hollywood BS ""production values"" and no personal revelations influenced by the glorious nature surrounding Sheryl(Reese W.)with every step she took. She hardly even noticed it except for the possible hardship it caused her! Awful, just awful. And, it was laughable that she decided on taking her ""grieving"" hike due to a trail guide she saw in a shop! Nothing more intelligent or insightful than that. This movie was that dumb, and Sheryl too if that was the true reason.Also, it's hard to feel sorry for a grown woman who took to careless and casual sexual train-pulling and drugs to deal with her mother's death. What? I lost total interest when it was clear that she had not learned anything belief-enhancing from her trek when she instantly jumped into the sack on a one night stand with some guy she met in the course of her hike. Classy broad, not, and one obviously very damaged by her terrible life choices. And, no signs those bad choices would get any better.And, the ending, what epiphany chances lost! The movie just ended at the end of the hike, with no clue of any insights or lessons learned or even if her grief was better.The theater where I saw this film had the sound so low everyone was complaining that they could not hear the dialog(lots of mumbling), and that negative surely affected this review. The cinematography and scenery were great, but that scenery was unused by Sheryl as a conscious pathway to discovery. She was more concerned with the miles she was logging(slogging)than any scenery. Reese did an OK job playing this broken woman with whom I had little sympathy, as she seemed to learn little from her trek but that it was hard, demanding and finally finished, but Laura Dern was much better as her loving and slightly batty mother. Really good. Too bad she was the one who died.So sorry my wife talked me into seeing this misguided ""effort"" as it was obviously a movie done only for money, and not for the desire to share any personal revelations that may have been spiritually rewarding or may have led to personal growth and change in Sheryl's damaged life perspective. We didn't see even one indication of that by the end! Of course, that would have required some brainpower and sensitivity. Only the money people's(Reese was one)motivation of ""Get those ticket paying butts in the seats! Hey, Reese is so cute""...........was the real motivation behind this loser that could have been so much more in different hands.",Wild

This tale, whether based on real story or not, is true 100% crap. Music choices were OK though but not featured enough to soothe the pain of having to sit through the disjointed dysfunction stuff. The main character Cheryl seems incapable of learning anything or making sense of anything that happens in her life. I presume she's a stream of consciousness kind of person who is so off in cloud cuckoo-land that practicalities are anathema. There's no entertainment or education to be found here.

88,trublu215,Wild is painfully boring and woefully misguided,2,30 November 2014,"Wild tells the story of Cheryl, a drug fueled binge drinker who lost her mother and feels lost on the path to life so she decides to pick up and walk the Pacific coast trail. Directed by Jean Marc Valèe of last year's Dallas Buyers Club, I was going into this hoping for a brilliant film, instead I came away with great cinematography, an unbelievable Reese Witherspoon and misguided story that wants to be something more than ""a woman and the wilderness"" movie. Well, unfortunately, its not. Valèe seems to have exhausted his talents into last year's Dallas Buyers Club rather than into Wild. My problems with this film exude my likes, obviously but one thing about this film that I can't seem to shake is Witherspoon. I don't buy her as this character, she can't pass as a woman who is a drinker and a drug abuser because quite frankly, she looks terrible on screen doing these things. I don't buy it for a second, it is like watching a student film rehash of a better performance and cringing at how bad the student screws it up. The role of Cheryl was clearly meant for someone with a better range than Witherspoon. I'm all for an actor to transform themselves to fit a film, much like McCounaghey did for Dallas Buyers. But Witherspoon seems so hesitant to do anything other than gain five pounds and not wear make-up for the entire film. No, it doesn't make it look like she has a drug and alcohol problem or is conflicted or is realistic, it just makes for a lazy performance and it is one I couldn't commit to for a two hour film. As far as the screenplay is concerned...well, what screenplay, it is mostly Reese Witherspoon trekking across the Pacific trail while reminiscing about past times and discovering dead end relationships along the way. It is a bare bones script from a bare bones book that was equally disappointing. However, the film may be boring and painfully slow, but the cinematography here was fantastic. There are some truly beautiful moments in this film regarding the way it looks. Outside Witherspoon, the supporting cast features Gabby Hoffman and Laura Dern and both of which deliver good performances. Overall, Wild features some great cinematography and a truly shoddy performance from Witherspoon. I can't begin to explain why she is being praised for taking off make up and walking on a trail for a two hour film. It isn't a brave performance, its a lazy one and an even lazier film. Wild is far from Sean Penn's Into the Wild, which I'm sure will be the base of comparison and feels more like a half baked version of it.",Wild
89,badajoz-1,Poor script lets down a valiant effort,5,10 May 2015,"The book is apparently the memoirs of a trek along the 1000 mile Pacific Crest Trail by Cheryl Strayed after her life fell apart following the early death of her mother. The hike and writing about it became a catharsis and redemption for her. The film is an attempt to show a fairly ordinary woman, who goes badly off the rails, who then walks herself back to reality and a normal life. Reese Witherspoon gives it her best shot in the lead role. Despite being a little small for the role, she wholeheartedly shows her body off and indulges in a few rude sex scenes as she falls from grace. She looks in great shape, and her admirers will not feel short changed! But the script dwells far too long - in flashback - on the past, and encourages you to dislike her character. She lets down a good husband, and her mother's memory. The walk requires the lead to suffer, review her life, gain some new insights, and finally to reach some sort of redemption. On all fronts the screenplay short changes us. She suffers a bit, but you do not get a real impression and feel for the three month hike. Personal insights in diary form are notoriously personal and often cliché-ridden. Cue for mumblecore acting to quickly waltz over any embarrassment! Redemption, if you're not paying attention, comes again in a minute long mumbling voice over that says everything in her life ended happily!!!!! It does not work overall and, therefore, is a disappointment. And the original photos taken on the hike (shown over the final credits) of Cheryl show her happy and smiling! Um... The direction is adequate, photography good, and the supports played well, but that script by Mr Hornby - get back to North London watching Arsene Wenger fail again and again to find your mojo. This is awful stuff. If you want a feel for what a long hike can do for relationships, watch again and again the scenes near the end with the three young men. They are odd but believable because they show the impact of a long arduous hike together, which Ms Witherspoon's character never quite manages.",Wild

91,antagonist117,An unpleasant and unoriginal adaptation of a unique and worthy memoir,5,20 December 2014,"Author Cheryl Strayed's life experiences, both before and during the Pacific Coast Trail trek at the center of ""Wild,"" were atypical. The lessons that can be gleaned from her experiences are universal, and that is part of what makes her story worth knowing. Nick Hornby's script conveys those lessons reasonably well, but it also forces the parts of Strayed's life that are particular to her into a movie template that is too generic and predictable: adjectives that belong nowhere near the name Strayed.Cheryl's relationship with her mother is an example. Laura Dern plays the infinitely loving, terminally-ill Bobbi Strayed with aching empathy. It is a subtle performance, and a good one, but not a believable one. She is too ready with the tear-jerking words of wisdom and the saintly reactions to barbs and blows. We see her again and again in one of those slow-motion, muffled, sepia-tinged moments of idyllic joy that movies always use to signify childhood memory. A storyline about Bobbi's beloved horse is hinted at throughout the film, and its obvious outcome is jealously withheld until the end, but when it comes it is anticlimactic. The memory focuses on Cheryl's brother more than Cheryl, and it has little relevance to the theme of self-destruction that colors most of the other memories we visit. It might have worked better in another part of the narrative, perhaps closer to the cringe-inducing, toenail-related opener.Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as Cheryl for the teenage flashbacks and the punishing trail scenes, but the parts in the middle are too great a leap for someone who seems so fundamentally, undisguisably put-together. This is exactly the kind of role, with its physical and emotional extremes, that highly successful but highly type-casted actors like Witherspoon look for when they want to show their unused depth. She wears the trailworn look well, and Cheryl's mixture of trepidation and determination are always evident on her face. But depth has its limits for every actor, and it's hard to believe that Witherspoon's Cheryl could have been so totally cavalier about her health as the real Cheryl was in her darkest times. The script does Witherspoon no favors. In the flashbacks it saddles her with a frumpy, sassy best friend archetype and a hangdog ex-lover straight out of every romantic comedy Witherspoon ever headlined. Surely Cheryl's real friend and real ex (like her real mom) had more individuality than their on-screen versions. In the present day, the screenplay shoehorns in profanity like a teenager just learning to curse, and Witherspoon has the impossible task of making it sound like the natural, seasoned cursing of an adult.Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its mischaracterization of long-distance hiking. The real Cheryl Strayed did choose a terrible year to walk the PCT. Heavy snows in its upper stretch kept many hikers away and made it a more lonely and dangerous trip than usual. But for maximum dramatic impact, the movie pretends that female hikers are an endangered species forever hunted by predators. It plays the rape card again and again, dimming the music and focusing on Witherspoon's expressive eyes when danger approaches. But after one shot of a particular trail marker in Oregon, I heard a woman in the row behind me say with obvious pleasure, ""I've been on that trail many times."" I've been on long hikes, too (nothing nearly as long as the PTC), and even in the less-frequented corners of national parks and on strenuous mountain ascents there are always plenty of women. Cheryl, in her highly particular experience, may have felt threatened and marginalized because of her gender. If so it makes her great perseverance all the more admirable. But by acting as if ill treatment of women is the norm on trails, the film turns a triumphant and inspirational story into a dire warning. In this way and many ""Wild"" is an unpleasant and unoriginal adaptation of a unique and worthy memoir.",Wild
92,Eddie_weinbauer,Not all thats its cracked up to be,3,17 January 2015,"this was suppose to Reese big comeback to the serious movies, Which I guess is why they put in all the nudity there.(She looks great though, for being 40+ and a mum) The landscape scenery is just fantastic at times, but always get interrupted by annoying flashbacks from her childhood or misspent youth. Which was just annoying as can be. you don't feel anything for her character, cause her background is all scrambled in flashbacks. A Little bit here a little bit there. The music in the movie, was kind of annoying. It wasn't really needed, and it didn't really fit.When you gonna walk the Mojave desert I would expect you to have a sunscreen and sunglasses, not to mention drink a lot of water. Yet the only time we see Reese drink is when she's at the rest stops along the trail, which is supposedly few and far between. She also get no sunburn which is strange, considering she wear shorts and t-shirt all the time. But she get a heavy pack. rash. which they use every opportunity they can to show off. The problem is Reese as a trail walker isn't believable, she just can't convince me that she's the type, she always look to damn perfect. Her hair is always straight and groomed. Her make up is always perfect. It makes me wonder, have these people ever seen backpackers outside of travel magazines? They are usually filthy and dirty and their hair is a mess. Reese hasn't one strain of hair out of place. The only sign she's been walking in the desert heat, are some dust in her face She also seem to have very little direction. Considering it some sort of a famous hiking trail, I would assume its pretty good market. Especially when you think of all the 1000 of people, whom must have walked ahead of her, and who must have hiked it before. Yet Reese, seem to walk all over the place.There was a scene midway into the movie, that made no sense at all. A man who stand on the street corner in some town delivering flyer's to passers by, comes over to talk to her. And suddenly she's afraid of him and start backing up, even though he's far outside her personal space and they're in the middle of a public street. At first I thought she knew him from her past. But as it turned out, they were complete stranger to each other",Wild
93,MarcoParzivalRocha,Personal growth and wild nature,7,22 August 2020,"Cheryl embarks alone on an adventure, on one of the most famous (and dangerous) trails in the world, in an attempt to overcome a trauma in her life. It's a film about personal overcoming and growth, connecting with nature and starting over. It is one of those films in which the interpretations are much better than the story itself. The writing is not extraordinary, the (adapted) script itself has already been seen in other films of the same genre, but what makes this film good is the role of Reese Whiterspoon, with incredible dedication and commitment. The cinematography has good moments, and the way that some scenes are cuted and the way that the film plays with the flashbacks, gives a good depth to the narrative. The viewer can relate with the story really easily.",Wild
94,Spideyfan-963-246215,Wild Review,10,8 September 2016,"Wild(2014) Starring: Reese Witherspoon, Gaby Hoffman, W.Earl Brown, Kevin Rankin, Michael Huisman, Thomas Sadoski, Laura Dern, and Mo McRae Directed By: Jean-Marc Vallée Review I've always liked Reese Witherspoon even though I don't see a lot of films with her. My favorite one of hers was Walk The Line. She now produces this amazing film adapted from a novel of the same name written by a woman named Cheryl about her real life journey. Ravaged by her mother's death, Cheryl Strayed had embarked on the 1,000 mile hike that trek almost impulsively, and her tale is largely internal. ""A primal grab for a cure, for the thread of my life that had been served,"" she writes. ""I could feel it unspooling behind me-the old thread I'd lost, the new one I was spinning as I hiked."" Reese Witherspoon has never been better, I said I don't see her in a lot of films but I hope she can keep getting leads like this I hope to see more of her in the future but I don't think she will be able to top her performance in this at least for quite a while. The supporting cast is great especially standouts like Laura Dern and Gaby Hoffman. People who read the novel thought this wouldn't be filmed but when you have a director like Jean Marc Vallee you can't go wrong. He made a film that adheres to Strayed's book in a lot of ways. he had delivered a film that is both graceful and gutting. I liked the soundtrack this film had as well it brought the extravagance of Cheryl's journey to life and made us a part of it. The film is beautifully shot, they can be fast and smooth or slow but still smooth. I liked the cinematography a whole lot. Powerfully moving and emotionally resonant with a great internal tale, Wild finds director Jean-Marc Vallee and star Reese Wittherspoon working at the peak of their respective powers in a moving working of art. I give Wild a five out of five.",Wild
95,santiagocosme,A story I have heard many times before!,5,26 March 2015,"There's nothing wrong with the movie. I think it's actually enjoyable. But let's face it. At this stage, with social medias, millions of blogs, radios, TV, etc.who hasn't at some stage heard the story of someone who goes on a trekking trip on his own to redefine himself? In fact during the film, the girl whose trip is the reason for this movie comes across a lot of people who, like her, have decided to trail solitary mountains to escape from their previous life. I don't think there's a lot of tension in the movie either. An elementl which for me is absolutely essential if you are to get hooked to a film. The girl goes around, while we see constant flashbacks of her pre-trip life and understand little by little why she took the decision of starting this adventure. I myself, traveled 3200km from NY to Colorado with 0 dollars to try to get a job, which I didn't get by the way. So while I have found some similarities with my own trip, I don't think her story is special enough to make into a movie. I guess this is a movie that people who have never done anything like this will enjoy a lot better. Only my honest opinion.",Wild
96,blakiepeterson,A Career Best for Reese Witherspoon,8,2 May 2015,"During much of Wild, I was reminded of PJ Harvey's infamous, cathartic punk tantrum ""Who the F***?"", off of her undeservedly underrated 2004 album Uh Huh Her. She spits and screams her way through the song's short two-minutes, its climax exploding with an expected ""f*** you."" As a whole, the album is smoked out and sometimes beautiful, a homemade piece from the heart. The songs range from atmospheric ballads to fuzzy rock battles, but ""Who the F***?"" is an outcry, a relief from built up emotions. It's loud, ugly and mean, and once it's over, the rest of album cools down and moves on: Nobody can stay angry for that long, right?For Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon), that song is a clear-eyed reflection of her life. She's furious with the world, but that fury is directed at no one in particular. There is no such thing as catharsis for her; she's always upset and even confused when realizing what her life has become. Cheryl has always been a self-proclaimed ""good person,"" but after she loses her mother (an incredible Laura Dern) to cancer, she completely lets go of the grasp she once had on responsibility. She's become a heroin addict. She has meaningless affairs like a thirsty nymphomaniac. Her marriage has fallen apart.There comes a point in this soon-to-be tragedy where Cheryl suddenly understands how much damage she is doing to her mind and her body. She catches a glimpse of a pamphlet advertising the daunting Pacific Coast Trail, which spans through several states and goes on for over 1,000 miles. Most would laugh at the thought and imagine a triathlon winner going on such an undertaking instead. Yet something about the PCT sticks with Cheryl. Maybe, just maybe, she will start the hike as the prettiest mess you'll ever see and end as the woman her mother wanted her to be. Cheryl has no experience and doesn't have the right equipment, but that doesn't stop her. What will? And so begins a journey of self-discovery. Let's get one thing straight, though. This is not the kind of self- discovery found in the buttery, book clubby pages of Eat, Pray, Love. This is the real deal.Most are calling Wild Reese Witherspoon's Dallas Buyers Club, making for a career resurgence and a return to serious acting roles. Both films are directed by Jean-Marc Valée. Coincidence? I think not. Valée's near documentary and very blunt style of filmmaking forces his actors to work even harder than usual: He can bring out award worthy performances even if the film itself isn't as award worthy.To be fair, Wild is a step above Dallas Buyers Club, which contained marvelous characterizations but was filmed in such a no-frills, sheerly flat sort of way that it was hard to love. While Wild is hardly a masterpiece, it comes close. The flashbacks, though nonlinear in their delivery, fit harmoniously into the storyline, as they stroll in whenever Cheryl is in a daze and is reminded of a certain memory. Somehow, we can understand why she decides to walk for 1,000 miles. There's a chance that, in other hands, this would have been a cry for broad comedy. But the film is instead truly felt and sometimes moving.I love actors, but other than Election, I am only vaguely familiar with Witherspoon's capabilities. After Wild, I feel like something of a fan. She doesn't forgo a Transformation Tuesday and shed 50 pounds or smoke heroin to ""get into the role""; she puts her heart and soul into her performance, embodying Cheryl Strayed with believable pathos. She places her face and body on the line, never masked behind a coating of makeup and never afraid to strip for a hazardous sex scene. We've had plenty of Sweet Home Alabama Reese, Walk the Line Reese, and This Means War Reese, but like Matthew McConaughey's McConaughssaince, Witherspoon is having a Reeseisance. Wild looks like the beginning of an entirely new chapter in her filmography. For actresses like Julianne Moore or Cate Blanchett, who have made careers off of strictly intimidating roles, this would be yet another remarkable performance. But for Witherspoon, it's a risky step that pays off dramatically. Surely, an Oscar nomination and a new career are in her future.Wild is based off of Cheryl Strayed's memoir, and it's looking like her ""Who the F***?"" days are over and some bright, Chaka Khan inspired ""I'm Every Woman"" ones are in full effect. If it's any indication, the Pacific Coast Trail has healing powers. Maybe when I turn 50 and a mid- life crisis is in my midst, I'll hike it. It sure worked for Strayed.

97,huggibear,Phew....what to say about this movie?,6,25 November 2017,"I usually wouldn't rip a movie apart like I'm about to do because most movies I watch don't irritate, irk or bug this heck out of me. This one did, but maybe that's just a personal thing. I hated this movie! Even though Reese Witherspoon acted the part very well, the movie was pretty boring, very long and drawn out (it dragged) and it was an overly dramatic flick that would not end soon enough. Some of the editing was sub-par with abrupt cross-overs from her memories back to her present-time. Granted, I should have never watched a movie like this on the FXM channel, which is not high- definition and I had to deal with commercials as well. It was by far, the worst movie I've ever had the pleasure of wasting time on. The movie itself was not awful (including the plot), just the little pieces and parts that caused it to drag on. And to think the movie could have been even longer because of the journey she took on that trail. I'm not going to give it a low rating because of my awful experience watching it, but it's not going to get a 7 Star rating. I have to go see what others are saying about it....out of curiosity. It has its own good qualities, so don't take my review of it at too much face value. You really have to watch it and form your own opinion. I think watching it in High Definition would have made a much better experience. Maybe the poor editing issue I experienced was due to that alone.",Wild

99,WubsTheFadger,Wild,8,2 January 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe acting is great throughout the entire film. Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern both do an exceptional job at portraying their respective characters. The characters themselves are deep and well thought out. Reese Witherspoon, in particularly, does a great job at playing a character that is broken and wants to be fixed.The story is really good. There are moments that are uplifting and moments that are hard on the heart. It is a story about redemption and finding peace in being human. The story is easy to follow and has some heavy moments throughout.The scenery is amazing. The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is an amazing location. As the movie progresses, you get to see different landscapes and scenery.For me, there was a good amount of nudity in the film that could have been avoided. I think they could have implied the sexual acts without showing them. I do like seeing Reese naked, but some of the scenes did not need to be in the film.The ending is good but it left me wanting more. I wanted a stronger realization.Pros: Great acting, deep characters, compelling story, some emotional impact, and amazing sceneryCons: Some needless nudity and needed a stronger sense of realization Overall Rating: 8.3/10P.S. If you enjoyed this film, you might also enjoy Into The Wild. Into The Wild is one of my all time favorite films. It is very similar to this film but has, in my opinion, a stronger ending in terms of realization.",Wild
100,stephendaxter,An emotionally moving story of someone trying to overcome her past decisions,8,24 January 2015,"Wild is an very emotionally moving film that follows the journey of Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) as she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail all by herself and is forced to overcome any difficulties or obstacles in her way. Reese Witherspoon carried this movie for the full 2 hours just like she carried her largely oversized backpack across the trail. Her performance was fantastic and stood out in a small cast that also had some interesting supporting characters. You really like her character the more you watch it and the more you find out about her past the more you begin to understand what she has gone through and just why she is putting herself through all that pain. Almost every moment in this film that she is both alone or interacting with other people; you feel means something and you get a lot of character development from those scenes which keeps you interested the whole time. The many flashbacks i found to be some of the most memorable scenes of the movie as they allow you to get an idea of Cheryl's past and her relationship with her mother (played by Laura Dern) and the way that drove her to both some dark and light places throughout her life. This is largely a story of one persons life and her struggle to overcome the past, the present and what may be to come. - 7.7",Wild
101,ilovesaturdays,Nature heals even the worst ones!,8,8 July 2020,"This is a movie where the protagonist is not a very decent human being. Her mother's death is a very big blow to her and she just disintegrates as a human being. She makes many bad choices. The worst of her sins is her mistreatment of a loving husband whose only fault is that he is very caring and supportive of her. After an even bigger personal debacle, she realizes that she has hit rock bottom. In order to pick up the pieces of her life, she decides to undertake a physically strenuous journey which will take her mind off her emotional pain and focus all her energy on simple day-to-day survival. As expected, her journey through the Pacific Crest Trail is very challenging and the movie depicts the slow catharsis that she experiences along the way. Alone in the wilderness, she starts realizing what really matters in life. She rediscovers the basic values that her mother had instilled in her as a child.The cinematography and the music are quite good. I really like the fact that the movie emphasizes the healing effect that nature can have on humans. It also restores my faith in human resilience; that no matter how far we fall, we can still reform if we put everything we've got into it. In a way, the film displays the triumph of human spirit.The movie is based on a real life story. That said, one still can't help feel that the protagonist is clearly very lucky. She escapes, relatively unscathed, through such a harsh ordeal with so many dangers both from nature as well as fellow human beings. Nature has healing properties but it is not particularly kind to weaknesses and only the strongest can survive. The protagonist was lucky that she found mostly good people and she managed to survive the harsh landscape with dangerous animals, considering that she was carrying nothing to protect her against any mortal danger.What I didn't like about the movie were the distracting and annoying flashbacks which are supposed to have been edited using the most modern techniques. I do not understand this obsession with creating unnecessary breaks in the continuity of the narrative. Those odious flashbacks made me miss the good old movies which were much simpler in their editing and therefore, didn't distract the viewer from the main story. Also, there were way too many sex scenes. I resent this oversimplification where in order to show the protagonist's promiscuous behaviour, the viewers have to sit through so many of their nasty sexual escapades. I believe that the viewers are refined and intelligent enough that even a single scene or two could have made the point. I wish the movie contained less of these gratuitous sex scenes, and was more about the journey and the catharsis that it brought to the protagonist.This could have been more beautiful. It's a shame that some flaws prevent it from being so.",Wild

I liked Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Dallas Buyers Club"" quite a bit, but here his naturalism and acting first approach shorts the story. Reese is really good in the role of Cheryl (maybe not selling the whacked out druggie bit enough however) but it's in service of a story that's not ever present, doesn't feel earned, or cohesive as a whole. There are scenes where Cheryl looks haggard and worn out, but we never see or feel her struggle for survival and redemption in the wilderness. This applies to every aspect of the story. The layering of flashbacks could have used a more poetic touch as well. It would have been mightily interesting to see what someone like Terence Malick could have done with the story. Nature and wordless flashbacks. Feels right.",Wild
103,lucasnochez,Film Review: Wild/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,7 December 2014,"It seems like there is no better way of finding yourself, than by losing yourself completely.Such is the case with Reese Witherspoon's newest feature Wild, based on the widely popular New York Times Best Seller and Oprah's Book Club 2.0 favourite ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"" written by Cheryl Strayed. Wild is based on a memoir, and Strayed did in fact trek the whole 1,100 mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail all by herself, and tells a compelling story of survival, wit and true courage, but never is her story original enough for us to really care. Overplayed images of crossing bridges, promises of clean slates and new life, as well as images of iconic natural beauty and wildlife, are some of the reasons Wild never quite settles in with audiences, as it should.Witherspoon, who dropped out of Tim Burton's Big Eyes (a role that eventually went to Amy Adams) may have found another passion project and Oscar-caliber character as Strayed. Embodying a troubled young woman who struggled with heroin, constant adultery and the tragic death of her loving and inspiration mother Bobbi (played saintly by the radiant Laura Dern), Witherspoon easily transcends through the screen and into our hearts as a highly empathetic character. Is Strayed a drug addict? Sex addict? Rehabilitating feminist? Many of these questions aren't really answered by the film's end or in the countless flashbacks (that easily takes up an alarming amount the film's runtime) of Strayed highly traumatizing and delicate life, which poses some of the many problems of the film as a whole.Quebecois filmmaker and go-to Oscar caliber actors-director Jean Marc-Vallée, who helped Matthew McConaughey complete his A-List status as Ronald Woodruff in the highly appreciated Dallas Buyers Club, helms Witherspoon in a highly clichéd and simple narrative where a woman's only choice and answer for change, is nature. Cue scenes of Strayed connecting with the wildlife by howling with the nearby wolves, numerous shots of her looking up and talking to herself as well as some of the most over-quoted identity passages ever written by Emily Dickenson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and of course Robert Frost, and Wild sinks in the footsteps of other memorable identity finding nature films.One film in particular that comes to mind, released just last year, is John Curran's Tracks starring Mia Wasikowska and Adam Driver. Not only does the film tell the story of Robyn Davidson, an author and true living bohemian who conquered the 1,700 mile journey along the west Australian deserts with four camels and a trusty sidekick canine, but Curran offers audiences an audacious and highly inspiring symbolic film filled with deep purpose, meaning and thought. Absent of all the highly Americanized gloss, including; narration, heavy-drama flashbacks and distracting pop culture references found in Wild, Tracks tells the story of a woman who suffered harsher condition, during a lengthier hike with less help from the outside world. By watching both films, it becomes clear that Wild is a film that reaffirms America's obsession with keeping stories of Americans more relevant than individuals internationally, sadly.Witherspoon may have delivered the performance of her life as Strayed, a woman who seems to overly dramatize the tragedies in her life by taking drastic measures. Strayed, whose life could have easily been made into a soap-opera miniseries, had the huge privilege of having her book connect with many housewives and identity-riddled middle aged women who found hope and purpose through the pages of her memoir, giving the film adaptation traction and leverage. Witherspoon, who in addition to starring in the film, acts as the films producer as well, transforms herself to a thin Strayed whose conquests from California to Oregon push the bodily limits of a highly tormented and dumbfounded character whose purpose of the quest is questioned repeatedly and given no due sympathy based on her lack of commitment to really anything at all in her life.Thankfully, the film isn't all that bad. One of the many strengths of Wild that isn't ever understood or put into perspective in other films is its ability to relate to many of the average audience members who would ever think of doing such a journey. Vallée sets-up perfect scenes of hiking preparation that blend perfectly with Witherspoon's mix of humour and daft seriousness, such as her first encounter with a backpack that is twice her height and triple the size of our protagonist. At some points in the beginning of Strayed's journey, we can't help but notice Witherspoon resemble a white-washed, patriotic version of Dora the Explorer with her handy-dandy backpack and all the useful things inside it (condoms included, if you could believe it), making someone who is just undeniable to relate to.Contrary to its title, Wild is a very tame coming-to-terms adventure narrative when the camera is placed on Witherspoon alone. Throughout Strayed personal discoveries, audiences are able to capture the essence of her struggles best with the many characters that come along her path. At times, the film plays with our expectations of the genre, sometimes veering into stylistic thriller/horror territory when she meets a land worker and burley American man Frank (W.Earl Brown), or buddy road film when she meets fellow hitchhiker Greg (Kevin Rankin), or romantic wilderness film when Cheryl meets the gorgeous bearded musician that is easily the hipster equivalent to Christian Grey for hikers in Jonathan (Michael Huisman). Vallée does a fantastic job of toying with different genre expectations, as well as the many stereotypes that come within the road film and the many different characters one comes to expect and know.",Wild

It is just like 2013's All Is Lost, but with hiking. And dialogue. And better.-I did not know how good Wild would be, but I was very impressed with this film! -The story is well adapted and told so well through some of the best editing of the year. It's emotional and real and could be a Best Adapted Screenplay contender.-The pace is pretty good, but does have a slow start and a slow end.-The acting is, well just Reese Witherspoon really. She will get an Oscar nomination because she made the film. Great job! -The characters are very real and the flashbacks help drive how broken people can be, but how people can always change and be better.-The music was good and fitting, but also somewhat isolating, matching the feel of the film.-It is an R-rated film and deservedly so. It has some language spattered throughout, not too bad. It also has some very (like a few seconds) brief nudity and sexual content a few times, but all for the point of showing how Cheryl's life is out of control and broken. Not heavy, but necessary.-So Wild was solid. It has top notch acting, writing, editing, and was an emotional and inspiring film. It has some pacing issues and is not meant for younger audience when it comes to its themes and content, but a lot better than some other films this year! I am glad I saw it and I will say Wild is worth seeing in theaters! I would give it a solid 8/10!",Wild
106,zenmateisshite,Truly unique way of portraying emotions,9,2 June 2020,"I wanted to watch this movie many times in the past years but always ended up choosing something else for some reason, until yesterday and I'm glad I finally watched it.As the movie started the first feeling was annoyance; you could tell Cheryl was ill-prepared and lacked the experience needed for a 1000 mile hike across the PCT's harsh terrain. It turns out it didn't matter - like they say: amateurs built the Ark, professionals built the Titanic. So yes I got over that, it is better if one knows what they're doing, but one doesn't need to be an expert to hike anywhere.Then it was obvious that this movie was written for women by a woman - I am referring to Cheryl's perspective on things and how she over-dramatized everything. But later I realized its actually very well written, and that perspective started to make sense when the full picture emerged. Also she was very self-aware; yes she was the queen of the PCT, so what?Then was questioning her choice to hike a 1000 miles to deal with the issues in her life. I had similar problems but never needed to go on a hike to deal with them. But then because the movie (and probably the book which I did not read) was written so well, I started to realize together with the Cheryl that grieving happens when you least expect it. You don't know how, and you don't know when, but it will hit you.That last scene with the little boy singing was amazing because it rang truth to my experience (not exactly the same but a bit similar) and how she started to cry uncontrollably, this is when she broke the barriers of grief.It is obvious that the Cheryl was hurting, she wanted to fix it but she couldn't and dealt with it the only way she could. What my experience tells me, and what this movie also showed is that you can see so many psychiatrists, you can read so many books, when it comes to grief, it is a personal experience. That smug cheap councilor did not help at all and I'm glad she did not stop there.Very good movie and highly recommended. Because it is very heartfelt based on true experience, I don't expect everyone to understand it in the same way, and this is obvious in this review section because so many disgruntled reviewers just don't know what they're talking about.",Wild
107,paul_3-960-896774,A little gem of a movie about goals and personal growth,7,20 May 2015,"Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.At first, it's hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she can shew, it's clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are peppered throughout the movie and like anyone you're getting to know she starts to make sense. You get to understand what she's been through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. It's a challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she needed.And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet strength that suited the character. I didn't totally relate to Cheryl but I wasn't completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams and life-goals to achieve.On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild as the female lead version of Into The Wild. I've never finished Sean Penn & Emile Hirsh's hiking movie but from what I remember Into The Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasn't on a hiking trail but in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these two characters have to undertake their journey.Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in one's truth. @wornoutspines",Wild
108,MUFCOK,"An emotional, moving story of personal development and finding yourself by taking extreme circumstances",8,24 May 2016,"Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl, a troubled young woman who has challenged herself to walk the 1000 mile trek along the Pacific Crest Trail in a hope of getting away from her troubles and to try and find herself in the wilderness. I was unaware when I watched this that it was originally a very successful book and I have read since that it was a well-made adaption of this.As this is a story of an independent walker, walking 1000 miles practically on her own, the acting from Reese Witherspoon needed to be strong. Thankfully, it was. She gave an incredibly convincing performance, I really bought into her character and spending so screen time alone made this easy to do, especially with her acting being so powerful. We do however have many other characters, both through the use of flashbacks and people she meets along the way on her journey. These are all very much supporting characters as not one specific character gets a significant amount of screen time (apart from maybe her mother). Nobody stands out as a bad actor and they all do their jobs impressively enough. Through the use of flashbacks we see Reese in a completely different light as a different person. She is able to switch between the contrasting roles very well which I was impressed with.This movie is filled with metaphors and deeper meanings from start to finish. As Cheryl makes her Journey, she is faced with challenges and reminders of her past. During these situations we are then taken on a flashback showing her troubled past and how her current experiences in the wild reflect painfully on these. The use of flashbacks is done extremely well in my opinion; they fit in with the current story effortlessly and are told in a clear chronological order which is easy to follow and understand. As the movie progresses we see more and more flashbacks which piece together and reveal her backstory. I did find this quite predictable, it was obvious from the start what had happened to her in her past and the flashbacks just sort of confirmed that for me.I was also impressed with the direction, the way in which it is filmed gave me a real sense of unease and anxiousness, I felt as if something bad was going to happen at any minute. When Cheryl meets with other people or reaches difficulties on her journey, I had the on edge feeling. The camera work which captures some magnificent shots of the wilderness is almost poetic. Watching one character walk through these locations alone drew me into the setting and convinced me that she really was the only person out there.My overall feeling while watching Wild was emotion. I found it a very emotional movie, from the message it delivered, to some of the powerful scenes, to the ending. Reese Witherspoon narrates the movie as she goes along through her thoughts, this gives us an inside look at what she is thinking and feeling when she is at her most desperate. Some of the flashback scenes are very powerful and incredibly well acted and directed.Wild isn't without its negatives by any means. As I said before, the early flashbacks made much of her backstory quite predictable and I didn't feel much shock factor when parts of her back story were fully revealed. I also sometimes felt that the cohesion in some of the scenes where she met people wasn't great. Cheryl met several different people, we are introduced to them, they have a few minutes screen time together and then they are gone, never to be seen again. Some of these characters do have significance to her story; however a few characters don't seem to have the same importance. It would have been nicer to see more depth to these people or just not show them at all as some of them weren't particularly relevant.We see Cheryl at the start of the movie, a completely uneducated novice in the hiking world, she has not prepared for the task and has made some fundamental errors. As the story moves on we see her progress, both in the hiking scenario and emotionally, seeing her overcome her past traumas and face her demons head on. As I said previously, there are plenty of metaphors here and the story of self- growth is a well-executed one.Overall, Wild is an emotional driven, personal movie with great direction, acting and a powerful message. It is a movie about personal development and redemption, I don't really understand the negativity surrounding it, I found it to be very well made and I would certainly recommend it.8/10",Wild
109,Snowgo,Do Something Great,8,5 April 2017,"I agree with Tom Berraras' review, but not his three star rating for Wild.This is a story that deserves to be told, and it was told well. Reese proved right for the part. What I liked most about the movie was it's refusal to candy-coat neither the ""earlier"" part of her life, nor the hike-segment experiences. The movie was from an auto-biography, so it apparently stayed close to the original illustration.What I would have like to have seen were 1.) A few minutes on scenes that showed what went through her mind when she chose to do the Pacific Coast Trail. How did her friends and family react? How did she make her gear selection/purchases? Also, some more inner dialogue along the Trail would have been good.There was some, and I recognize this, but there must have been some thoughts/feelings that were relatively cheerful/positive that propelled and sustained her on her journey. We see, instead, mostly recollections of negative past experiences.All-in-all, this is a memorable movie and one well-worth watching. It takes very few dramatic liberties, but instead is a sometimes-hard look at the life of one emotionally wounded person and her search for the unconditional joy that her mother offered her.Some more exploration of the evolution of the inner person would have been helpful, but I enjoyed Wild very much.",Wild
110,vistheindian,A powerful journey,7,17 March 2015,"Quickie Review:Cheryl takes on one of the biggest physical and mental challenges of her life by hiking the over 1700km Pacific Crest trail. As she forges ahead she reflects upon her life tragedies and the mistakes she has made. This hike is her way to self-heal and find some inner peace. Wild is more than just a movie about a hiker. Reese Witherspoon does a great job of showing the strength and the weakness of her character, both emotionally and physically. As the story progresses you more and more root for Cheryl. This is a powerful journey to experience about a woman determined to become a better person.Full Review:With Oscar buzz and nomination of Reese Witherspoon, it's fair to say that I had some high expectations for the movie. While for the most part Wild did live up to the praise, there are two small problems that I had with the film.Let me start with the obvious, yes Witherspoon gives an Oscar worthy performance. She conveys the transformation of her character from the beginning of the hike to the end, with incredible ease. Some of my favorite parts of the movie was when she is all alone, which says a lot about how well she carried the film (and the monster she called a bag). Before going to see this movie I was concerned how much of a story can we get out of a hike. This is where the non- linear flashbacks of the movie help enrich the motivation behind Cheryl's hike. In the beginning you don't really understand why anyone with little hiking experience would take on such a task. However, as she follows the trail, she is reminded of her past that we witness in the flashbacks. In these scenes we see her as a child, her late teens, and her marriage. She is completely different person in each of those phases of her life but Witherspoon pulls off those differences and changes convincingly.There are two small issues I have with the movie that I wish was handled a little better. Wild also stars Laura Dern playing the mother of Cheryl. She was a very likable character in the flashbacks but because of the non-linearity of the timeline her scenes don't always flow together. Dern acted really well and her character was the emotional catalyst for Cheryl's story, so it is a pity that I didn't find her story as impactful as it should've been. The other problem I had with the film was that every other person Cheryl meets along the way is shown as a creep. Of course there were one or two of them that were legitimately threatening but that doubt is repeatedly put on people who actually end up being helpful. It as if the filmmakers wanted to us to fear for Cheryl's safety amongst strangers but it happens so often that it starts to feel forced.All in all I really liked Wild mainly because of Witherspoon's performance. I wish Dern had more to do in the film because of how vital she was to Cheryl's life, but at least her flashbacks did do its job in developing the motivation behind the actions. I'd recommend giving this movie a shot if you haven't done so already.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Wild
111,williambendavis-933-218958,Beautifully filmed and deeply emotional,8,1 January 2015,"For a movie that's about someone hiking for 2 hours, I'd say they did more than a good job with this film. If any inexperienced filmmaker took this on, it would be a tiresome bore. Thankfully this fell into the right hands and we got something great. It's a beautifully filmed and strongly emotional film, that has a fantastic performance from Reese Witherspoon. She won't be winning any Oscars, but she was still great. Like I said, it's an emotional film and that is what really makes this movie worth watching. During the hike we see our main character reminisce over the things that have destroyed her life, and that is the weight of the film. Without that, we'd have a movie about an unsympathetic main character walking around for 2 hours. Luckily we got the opposite, and I recommend you go out and see it.",Wild
112,ahegde3149,A partially satisfying journey of self-realization,6,22 February 2015,"There have been many movies about a person wandering into the woods alone where the person undergoes a inner-transformation. While, Wild is not quite an outstanding film but I felt was certainly worth a watch. Wild tells us the chronicles of Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) a woman who decided to go on 1,100 miles hike on Pacific Crest Trail alone. We have no clear cut idea why she undertakes such a difficult task until halfway into the film. The reason gets unveiled slowly with strings of flashbacks of Cheryl's memories with her mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) and husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski). It seems Cheryl is in a distraught state and has no idea what do with her troubled life when she starts her journey. The journey, which tests her limits and gives us some lessons of life.The story may seem quite straightforward and simplistic, yet there is enough depth given to psychological study of the characters. Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Cheryl is worthy of the Oscar nomination as she carries the weight of the film like the 'monster' bag she carries on the hike. Laura Dern also received an Oscar nomination for supporting actress. Her screen time was surprisingly less but she is great in every shot. The imagery of the hike trails is very beautiful and worth a mention. The music and sound is apt for the wilderness shown. On the contrary, the dialogues are not very uplifting as the theme of the film. The random 'quotes' which Cheryl puts up every now feel bit too repetitive just like the lot of unnecessary abusing in the script. There is over-abundance of sentimentality thrown in with no strong substance to back it up. By the end, it slightly felt like emotionally manipulative journey instead of a satisfying one. Also, I felt the film is 20-25 minutes longer and could have been more effective is with better editing. Overall, Wild gave me mixed feelings but strong performances by Reese and Laura made me like it more.RATING: [3/5]",Wild

114,JeanMoniette,3 pointer for the photography,3,12 June 2020,"Spoiler free: ""Wild"" is a story about redemption which bring neither redemption and for that matter any payoff to its viewers. It also delivers an absurd ending where the lead character narrates 'what happened next' , violating the basic rules of exposition.Then again, this happens throughout the movie, and the director, unable to convey emotions through his actors, has them deliver voice overs, akin to so many thought bubbles.You'd think at least the movie would have the courage of its convictions, but it doesn't, it's one ex machina from another to deliver the main character from an endless series of rapists and creeps which seems to populate it.As I said 3 points for the photography as this was shot entirely with natural light, quite the feat, and you can tell there's an AD somewhere in this movie worth his salt trying to salvage it from rack shot hell.It could have been brilliant, unflinching , instead it's a soggy mess.",Wild

Her past is both loving and lonely - as is the case with most mothers and daughters - the relationship is not relished until it is gone. And with the decisions Cheryl made after her mother's death - she had to change. A 1100 mile walk, with no experience in the wild - amazing decision and it was good watching her transformation.

118,Sonofamoviegeek,Dreck Trek,2,5 January 2015,"Wild fails as a movie for several reasons. A movie based on a book should motivate the movie-goer to turn to the written word for more details. The impression I received from seeing wild is that the book is a self-serving portrayal of a self-destructive personality and some sort of redemption through a self-destructive hike. I suspect that the book uses the personal pronoun singular far too often. If the hike is the path to redemption, when did it occur and why? Damned if I know. We're told at the end that Cheryl ultimately has a happy life and take that on faith because the movie doesn't provide a clue.Another reason the movie fails can be seen in the opening credits where Reese Witherspoon is listed as a producer as well as the star. That usually means that the movie is the star's ego piece. Wild is a prime example of Reese's ego. There are numerous shots of Reese's fanny, Reese having rough sex, Reese showing her itty-bitties in the shower, but you get the idea. Reese's need to have her bod always well displayed leads to being exquisitely coiffed after emerging from the trail. Reese spends weeks walking the Mojave desert in the sun, she has no tan. When she bares all (which is often), the only after effects of all the time outdoors is some pack rash. There won't be any awards for makeup for this film.Give this a skip. There's better entertainment out there.",Wild
119,john32935,So disappointing,3,20 January 2015,"I wanted to like this movie (and expected to for Reese Witherspoon alone) but after watching it, I cannot say I do.The movie chronicles the true story of the solo trek of Cheryl Strayed along the Pacific Coast Trail – an undertaking which is daunting even to the seasoned hiker and which should have been near impossible to someone as unprepared as Ms. Strayed. While the film presents some of the obstacles facing a trekker and some of the breath-taking scenery that is the benefit of such a hike, it focuses too much on the past bad relationships and personal bad choices that provided the motivation for Ms. Strayed to hit the road. Yeah, back-story is important, but here the back- story seems to take as much screen time as the main story. And since I cannot relate to a person who abandons her good spouse to indulge in drugs and other reckless behavior, I did not really find myself rooting for Ms. Strayed to complete her journey and beat her inner demons.",Wild
120,GoUSN,Oddly wooden; keeps you at a distance.,5,4 January 2015,"Maybe it's my kind of sheltered background, but can one person have been THIS promiscuous? I guess that explains her penance: hiking the beautiful but sometimes dangerous Pacific Crest Trail, alone, as a cleanse.I like Reese Witherspoon and believe her characterizations in all (oops; now only ""most"") of her films, but in the end I think she's better suited to comedy than drama. Or maybe because she's done such strong comedies that I can't picture her in a drama anymore. Whatever it was, this particular story - a true story - was not all that gripping, despite the obvious ways it could have been.The set-ups for danger seemed contrived and stage-playish. As overlay, we learn of Ms. Stray's (Reese Witherspoon) seedy past through flash-backs. Mawkish and conspicuous without conveying deeper meaning that links to the narrative. Through the same technique we learn of her mother and her love for her mother. But these scenes too seemed contrived and manipulative. I mean, I know that all entertainment is to some extent manipulative, but I don't think we should be so aware that it's going on.Then there's this. I saw Into the Woods a few days after I saw Wild. Whether through the fanciful whimsy of my sometimes absurd brain, or some genuine similarity, my instant reaction to the first forest scene in Into the Woods was ""that gal in Wild should be walking through here right about now.""

There might be many, many ways to recover from past and to move on but Cheryl chose this 'wild' option. Not to complain much about because it's based on a true story, but sometimes that too feel like a long lost fiction.To be honest, one who's a true wild fan,he or she won't forget ""Into the wild"" which was a very true tribute to adventure genre. But this one is much quirky, off bit yet not so engaging tale. The character development is much, much poor. The story would have contained some emotions-to make movie energetic in a 'live the movie' sense-but no; the director gave much more concentration to strength, willpower and enthusiasm of the protagonist which never required in such tale. It is a story of not finding one actually, but it is a story of plain redemption from reality, and not to have courage to face it. Reese Witherspoon is much keen, passionate for her role as well as in movie too where she's going to walk 1100 miles, oh wait, alone? She's going to meet a lot of people but for what? She's desperate with old people and is always in search of newbies. Again, despite of being titled Wild, almost 60 percent of the movie doesn't contain wild. The movie has too many humans, human relationships and all which takes movie to nowhere against those scenic beauties, captured photography, beautiful scenes in beginning of film. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, technical aspects are well driven. But, the script would have been tight and to the point which has more Wild than cities, high buildings, human perceptions.

A rewarding one by all means, but the other characters are peripheral.Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a woman whose marriage is disintegrating, who is losing her mother and sadly, herself to a life of selfish decisions and quick living. Eventually she has enough and decides to hike the Pacific Trail on her own. Realistically enough, we see her with an overloaded knapsack to start, which gets lighter as her own personal load gets lighter as well.Cheryl spends night after night in the desert, near rivers, trying to survive on her meal rations and wits. She is unnerved by the sounds, the sights, the remoteness of it all. Our protagonist finds she is not alone though as she meets a few men along the way, some of whom are predatory, others helpful and others plain goofy (the author of the Hitchhiker's Magazine is one of the latter). Thanfully she survives and gains the title of ""Queen of the PCT"" for her undaunted efforts.The movie ends as we see Cheryl finally arrive at her destination after meeting a mother and son escorting a llama. She looks wistfully at the path travelled, uncertainly at the path ahead and our movie closes on us. We've learned much from her though. That she could survive without her husband and friends, that she could overcome mental and physical anguish and more improtantly, that her life is hers.A bravura performance by Ms. Witherspoon that made her quite worthy of an Oscar nom.",Wild
125,supatube,Cheryl's emotions are lost in a wild and desolate space,7,2 April 2015,"An arduous journey across America on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed tests her tenacity to continue forward till the end. There's very little else to the story, which makes this film really powerful. With not much else other than a tedious walk and a vampish past the story bobs back and forth between the present and the past revealing how Cheryl finds herself in such a circumstance and why she cant stop until she is finished. At first Cheryl seems like a woman unable to let go of her now ex-husband, beginning a journey with more baggage than is necessary. It might almost be easy to throw this story into the bin of sappy chick-flicks when that inability to get closure on a relationships end is actually fronting as more of an act of remorse and regret. She messed up. And there is no way to repair the damage without an ugly scar.The further she goes the more she dives into the series of events that lead her to such a devastating circumstance of sex and drugs. The loss of her mother is far too much for her to feel. The depth of such pain can sometimes strip a human being from feeling anything at all. The tears flow from her face but those tears are not falling for grief, they drop from the overwhelming numbing the death has caused. Cheryl's emotions are lost in a wild and desolate space that is pain and grief, which is so perfectly mirrored with the vast, open landscape she is now physically wondering through. And both her emotions and the land are the same: it wont change immediately and things will be tough but if one keeps going forward one will come out of it. And better for it. Cheryl just needed that physical aspect to make the connection with her emotions. The self-loathing and destructive life she was living was the equivalence of her just lying down on the sandy path and dying right there. It's a fairly event-less film where a woman just goes through some fairly tough terrain but somehow the flashes to her past spliced in with the turmoil of her present moves the story along swimmingly.If you're a fan of deeply emotional story lines this one might very well be worth the watch.",Wild

I suppose one would have to have such an extreme bond to go to such extremes as this woman did over the death of her mother. It is hard to imagine going to the extremes she did before she took on the Pacific Crest Trail. I was hoping to see more of the PCT, it's something I have heard a lot about and I would have liked to have seen more of it, but the focus tended toward showing memories of her mother that didn't quite do enough to make me understand her grieving process.

128,don2507,"Beautiful Scenery, Gutsy Woman, Mildly Interesting",6,22 June 2015,"I watched this movie because I'm fascinated by the rigor and beauty of the Pacific Crest Trail and also because I'm a Reese Wiitherspoon fan. Her character has a tough life: a deserting father, a death in the family, and a broken relationship; all contribute to her self- destructive behavior (drugs, promiscuity) that ultimately leads to her resolve to do a solo ""through-hike"" of the Pacific Crest Trail from the deserts of Southern California to near the Canadian border. The hike commands the most screen time and any motivating factors as revealed in her past history are told via numerous flashbacks, some lengthy and some only several seconds in length. I believe the flashback technique was the best method to convey her personal history and at the same time focus on the hike, and yet the sheer number of them added an element of confusion and obscured, for me at least, a clear view of motivating factors.Speaking of motivation, am I the only person to compare this slender woman hiker, terribly weighed down by a backpack almost as big as she, with Robert De Niro's Rodrigo character in The Mission pulling a similarly heavy weight behind him as his party trudges up the falls, the massive weight being his explicit penance for his sins: slave trading and killing his brother? Some reviewers have seen a kind of penance as the motivation for this rugged hike, although it should be noted that her ""sins"" are more self-destructive and her personal tragedies generate some sympathy. The author of the book on which the film is based, however, claims that her hike was more an endeavor of self-acceptance. Penance vs. self-acceptance? Or something else? The concept of ""sin"" is increasingly vanishing from our secularizing culture, and self-acceptance is just another way-station to self- esteem, the apparent ultimate goal in our culture.I found the scenery on the hike gorgeous at times, and found her interactions with other hikers plus folks along the way interesting. I give a ""through-hiker"" on the PCT tons of credit. According to ""America's Great Hiking Trails"", more people have stood atop Mount Everest than have through-hiked the PCT. It has deserts and mountains and temperate rain forests, and also has 315,000 feet of elevation gain and 315,000 feet of elevation loss to be climbed and descended in perhaps half a year. That's impressive!",Wild
129,natalierosen,I loved this film,10,26 December 2014,"Reese Witherspoon, as in other performances I have seen of her, is brilliant in this performance as well and my rating shows it. I loved this film. There were many moving moments but my rating of excellent revolves around what I see as the centrifugal force from which all other aspects of the film flow.This film, a true story, of a woman whose life is shattered by the death of her mother whom she adored and from whom she drew breath is I think an example of endurance, strength, courage and the sheer will to survive the near impossible obstacles nature presents hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. The understatedly arduous hike of a woman with a back pack perhaps weighing 75 pounds or more along the Pacific Crest Trail to recapture her shattered life is amazing.I thought the film a metaphor for many who have suffered, as Shakespeare's Hamlet says ""the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" that life can convey but go on despite those hardships and sometimes because of them. A road not taken or a life's love lost the consequences of which can seem insurmountable until we do persevere. We may learn from those difficult experiences; we may take another road leading to other, perhaps, better things or those tragedies may have no meaning at all. The film allows for that and it allows for us to see a woman go where few women have gone to defeat the obstacles that nature places in her path, greet impossible odds and overcome them. Some people help her along the way and some do not but she bravely encounters them and goes on.I thought this film, too, a metaphor for life. We may encounter great hardships, perhaps, even seemingly impossible ones but endure and survive as she did. This film is not tied into a neat bow though. It leaves the viewer the ability to draw our own conclusion as to whether her journey down the Pacific Crest Trail and the arduous journey she and many of us face throughout life is worth it or not. It appears she did think it worth it and it seems most of us usually do.",Wild

131,CharlieGreenCG,Darkness of self-redemption,7,23 October 2014,"When The Proclaimers sang about walking 1000 miles, it was meant metaphorically. In Wild, Reese Witherspoon's character does it quite literally and walks an incredible 1,100 miles...With its screenplay adapted by Nick Hornby, and under the direction of Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers Club), Wild collates the account of author Cheryl Strayed's true-life, played by Witherspoon. The title of which shares two meanings. One, that she is out walking in the wild, and two, that she had quite wild behaviour. On her journey, it is not just a heavy 'monster' bag that she carries, but also her damaged past of sex, drugs and death. The hike, or the reasoning behind it, is to 'walk herself back to the woman she once was' and get her life back in the right direction.Set in 1995 and walking from the Mexican Border to Canada (via the large wilderness) the hike should take an estimated three months. But we catch up with her at different points as the narratives travels through past and present explaining the hardships of how she got into the situation.For Reese Witherspoon, this is her definitive role and by 1,100 miles a career best. It is far emotional, physical and sexually explicit she has ever been before. All in the name of her new image and production company (Pacific Standard), in which aims to create stronger female orientated films. With Gone Girl and Wild now on their filmography it is fair to say that they succeeding.What we get as we are taken on this journey with Cheryl, is a darkness of self-redemption. It bares similarities to 127 Hours and Mitty' in terms of character cycle and travel - but more similarly Sean Penn's Into The Wild. At times, Wild hooks you emotionally during flashbacks, more often about her relationship with her mother, played by Laura Dern. But at other points you do not feel as connected and physically tired of taking the journey.",Wild

Cry a little. Reminisce a little. Swear a little. And Presto. All done. At the end of your voyage you have found yourself. Now you are happy. Now you're at peace. Your life no longer is terrible. This film reads like a self help book, only I'm still wondering how exactly she came out of the travel, better off financially - when she had not two dimes to her name. Oh, of course, cause she fell into the lap of a man who married her and gave her a home. Seems this woman, Cheryl Strayed, only ever got by, going from one man to the next looking for favours from them. It's the same at the beginning of her trek, during, and after. She still has no answers to why one particular turn in life leads to a specific result, because she has no macro perspective of her behaviour and its consequences. She's just strikes it lucky in the end, nothing to do with an epiphany.Warning, don't jump into the wild unless you prepare for it in advance, that once you come out, you have a home to go back to, and money in the bank to tide you over for a couple of months. Because the Hollywood fairytale ending is extremely rare in reality. And don't believe for one minute anything written by Cheryl Strayed to be authentic. Even the name rings so false; a name specifically chosen to sell a: lost in life, now found through hiking ""autobiography.""Sorry, Reece, but that perma-scowl on your face in this movie did not make me like you at all.",Wild
133,agblum,Could have been Better - But Good.,8,24 December 2014,"""Wild"" is based on the true story, told in the Novel - ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"" by Cheryl Strayed. It tells the story of Strayed, played by Academy Award Winner Reese Witherspoon, who in 1995, takes a more than thousand mile hike alone along the Pacific Crest Trail – which include parts of California, Oregon, Washington State, and terminating at the US-Canada border. Strayed has decided to pursue the journey to heal herself following - including - the death of her mother, divorce, and heroin addiction. We learn Strayed's story through flashback as she goes through trials of the hike as well. While I can't say the movie is as good as I feel it could have been (I have not read the book if your wondering), it mostly keeps you interested, and Witherspoon has her moments, in what is a role that is getting her Oscar buzz. It's a movie I will see again, and it may improve for me. For now – Good, not Great – 3 out of 4 Stars.",Wild

The main character talks to herself about the unstoppable events life threw at her and how she reacted, like we all do from time to time, and it's refreshing to see that on screen. She searches for a way. Reese Witherspoon portrays the character very well, both physically and emotionally. A movie rarely spans 'things about life' in such a successful way, in my opinion. Very recommended!",Wild
135,Shaun_of_the_Dude,"Decent, but just that.",4,23 April 2019,"I won't bore you with the details of the plot, but if you're here, chances are, you're here because either you are a trekker, or have watched Into The Wild.It's no coincidence that these events took place a few years after McCandless and it is of no coincidence that this film is similar in many, many ways.It feels like a pet project and I think, at times, it shows. RW has never struck me as a great actor - this film does little to change that notion. When you play in a biographical film, you're taking on a lot of responsibility, and this here film looks like RW, playing make-believe.There are many struggles one faces on a trail, but most of the real-life struggles aren't portrayed and the filmmakers focused on the characters life and troubles. This has been done before with Into the Wild and I really wanted to like this film, but the similarities with Into the Wild, directly pit it against Into the Wild, and it fails.Men are torrid, yes, we get it - but people don't need reminding of that every other scene.If you're looking for the female version of Into the Wild, this is it, but don't expect to like the character - maybe this is the point, who knows? I don't even think the film itself knows what it wants to portray.I wouldn't recommend this film, it doesn't have much of a centre and tells of the woes of someone running (or walking) from their demons. The character isn't likable enough to warrant redemption, but hey, people are going to be inspired by McCandless and this is what this is.Do yourself a favour and read the summary on IMDB, it'll save you time and effort and will tell you whether or not you should invest your time in this film.",Wild

Read lots of hiker stories since then.Laura Dern is great in this and Reece's character is challenging to like at times but you soon see the human frailty. Yes it's told from a female perspective and I think some reviewers forget that. It's not demonising men. It's told through the eyes of Cheryl. It's HER perception of life/reality.

137,TheOneManBoxOffice,Inspiring tale of self-discovery.,10,25 June 2019,"After filming the critically-acclaimed ""Gone Girl"" with director David Fincher, actress and film producer Reese Witherspoon obtained the filmmaking rights to a biographical novel by author Cheryl Strayed. The novel talks about Strayed's story of redemption where, after a lifetime of abusing herself, embarks on a journey of self-discovery by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), a trail on the west coast that begins at the border of Mexico and ends at the Canadian border. The film, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, would be entitled ""Wild"", and would feature Witherspoon (who is also the film's producer) portraying Cheryl, and as she makes the difficult trek through the trail, we also witness the events of her past that led to her decision to take on the PCT, from her difficult life with her family since childhood, her eventual experimentation with heroin, selling herself for sex, and the troubled relationship with her mother.When I first saw this picture a while back, I never thought I would be as captivated in Cheryl's journey as I am to this day. Her story of having to trek through over one thousand miles of rough terrain in order to get a new start in life is a fascinating and inspiring one. As we see her struggles both on and off the trail, we delve futher into Cheryl's character and why she goes to the extreme in order to recover from her past.One thing to note about the picture is the brilliant cinematography that brings out the color of the environments, and how they chose not to keep the camera steady to keep with the natural aesthetic, despite the fact that, even though the PCT spans through several U.S. states, practically all of the film is shot in Oregon (my home state). I also love the musical choices for the soundtrack, with the highlight being Simon & Garfunkel's ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could)"" serving as the film's theme.I absolutely love this film, not just because it's one of the best independent pictures I've seen, but because it's a powerful tale of cleansing one's soul through determination and perseverance. This is a must-watch for anyone looking for an empowering story put on motion picture film.",Wild

I guess if there is one thing about the movie that I did not like is all the flashbacks. I understand the need for them but for me there were just too many.

But if you turn into a selfish beyond belief type, break everything and everyone's heart around you just to avoid dealing with pain... Well that sort of makes you a broken and at least slightly evil sort doesn't it? So does the main character get to have her cake and eat it too?

140,Matt-144-792009,Wild is One Of Reese Witherspoon's Career Defining Roles. A Very Strong Performance.,7,3 December 2014,"In the movie Wild (2014), Reese Witherspoon plays the real life Cheryl Strayed, a woman tortured by personal demons who makes a 1,100 mile hike from Mexico to Canada. Along with the evils of nature and evil nature of man she encounters, Cheryl is on a deep journey of self discovery. The movie is based on the real Cheryl Strayed's book of the same name. (I didn't read it) The real Cheryl has a cameo as the first person to pick up Reese's Cheryl hitchhiking. This is director Jean-Marc Vallee's follow up to last years critical success, Dallas Buyers Club (2013).Wild is a great showcase for Reese Witherspoon's acting talent. From the first seen, the movie sets you up for how painful the journey will be with a do-it-yourself podiatry work scene on a broken toenail. From there on out the pacing is deliberately slow yet methodical. Self discovery requires much time spent pondering life and flash backs. Laura Dern gives a heart breaking performance as Cheryl's dying mother. Reese has reached a new level in here career with Wild. Cheryl is not a glamorous singer like June Carter, in Walk the Line (2005). One can't help but be reminded of Emile Hirsch's role in Into the Wild (2007), or James Franco's 127 Hours (2010). To call Wild the female version of these is not to do it justice, Reese's performance is on the same level. No need to account for gender. I have always been a big Reese Witherspoon fan. Only not the Rom-Com, mainstream Reese; not a fan of the Legally Blonde (2001) series or movies like Sweet Home Alabama (2002). I first fell in love with Reese with Mark Wahlberg in Fear (1996). Then it was Freeway (1996) and Election (1999) that solidified her as a very eclectic, fun actress. If you haven't seen either of those movies, check them out if you are a Reese fan. I think its interesting this role in Wild is also directed by the same director as Dallas Buyers Club. I think Reese has a very similar career path as Matthew McCaunehey. Both with southern twang and charm who built strong box office credibility with romantic comedies. Now in the second half of their career they are pushing with more challenging roles. Reese's performance in Wild should earn her a nomination for best actress this year.Also not to go unmentioned in this film is its solid soundtrack. Simon and Garfunkle's El Condor Pasa/ If I Could, will haunt you well after the movie is over. The songs play out in echoes, like music from memory in a long time spent reflecting. Songs you just can't get out of your head in the soundtrack of life. I love the use of Portis Head's Glory Box in the more ominous drug and sex scenes. That song is a great mood setter. I was excited to recognize Everclear front man Art Alexakis in a small cameo as a tattoo artist. The closing credits has one of my new favorites, Swedish Band First Aid Kit doing a cover of R.E.M's Walk Unafraid.In reflecting on this movie, I feel inspired to go on a similar journey. In our modern lives, with all the chaos of technology it becomes a fantasy to ""go off the grid"". I think in contrast this could be a very comforting story during the crazy holiday season. Similar to 127 Hours or Into The Wild, yet with far less dire outcomes, this movie is about the triumph of the human spirit. The lesson being that its the ups and downs of life that make the journey all worth it.If you enjoyed this review please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",Wild

142,scottjohnson7896,A Misguided Trek of Self-Discovery (Raging Film Reviews,7,21 December 2014,"A thousand miles is a long way. It's even longer if you're alone,  recovering from addiction, and enduring the elements in an attempt to  redeem yourself for the mishaps that have happened in your life. This  is essentially the gist of what Wild, the autobiographical, novel-  adapted film starring Reese Witherspoon is about. While the film is  strong in acting, it lacks in excitement and any sense of direction and  guidance for a movie that is all about the journey, ultimately leaving  us scratching our heads as to whether or not it was entirely worth it.  Cheryl has had a tough couple years. The trailers hint at these  tragedies, but I do not want to spoil anything so I will only say that  she is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, which extends from Mexico up to  Canada, in order to overcome said tragedies. After some mishaps and  poor planning, she finds herself in love with the wilderness. She finds  solace in her self-imposed solitude. Through flashbacks we come to find  out what had befallen her and her inspiration to drop everything for  three months to hike the 1,000 mile trail.   Reese Witherspoon wholeheartedly owns this role. In her best work since  Walk the Line, she truly becomes Cheryl. Through her we experience the  pains and sorrows she dealt with. The drug addiction, the  relationships, and her exceptionally large backpack all weigh down on  her. Witherspoon bares it all, unleashing fury and rage in her attempts  to overcome the pain she has suffered. She never holds back and it  truly shows even in her face and body as she becomes bruised and  battered from the three month long journey to find some sort of relief.  Cheryl is flawed, damaged, and sometimes unlikable, but she is  nonetheless entertaining to root for and encourage. Witherspoon is  certainly going to be a front-runner for the Best Actress award this  year, and my vote is on her, because in some ways she definitely saves  the film.  So, while we have this long trek of self-discovery and redemption  through the wilderness, there is not much guidance in terms of what  appears on the screen, and a severe lack of any moments where the trip  truly weighs down on her after the first couple miles. The flashbacks  come at rapid intervals; sometimes we forget where she is because they  last so long. At other times they aren't even entirely relevant but  rather passing memories brought about by something on the trail. If I  had had some way to measure a ratio of flashbacks to present, it would  probably come out to a staggeringly close equality. The film is too  dominated by flashbacks in trying to explain her need to partake on the  hike, instead of focusing on how the trip physically and mentally tests  her. One would also expect that any film about someone fending for  themselves in the wild would have some sort of danger and excitement,  but the moments of peril come very far and few between. There are  hardly any animals in the film, which is surprising because she spends  three months in the wild, and when we do see them they do not last for  long. .  The director, Jean-Marc Vallee, whose most recent work is Dallas Buyers  Club tends to be able to achieve impressive performances but when the  film comes down to its final moments, he leaves it off without  explaining what has happened in much detail. I found this same problem  in Dallas Buyers Club when, at the end of the film, we do not learn of  what really became of Ron Woodruff, and the major issues of the movie  are summed up in just a few words of dialogue or narration which kind  of negates what the journey has set up for the ultimate self-  discovery. Wild is no different, and it is even more of a blow because  the movie was all about the journey but we don't quite get an idea of  what became of her life after this immense undertaking.  In the end, Wild never fully lives up to what it promises throughout  the film. This does not make it an entirely bad film, but the promises  it makes never are fulfilled to the point of a great satisfaction. The  journey is emotional and interesting, but when it comes down to what is  learned by it all, the lesson is either not addressed enough or summed  up so quickly that it breezes by you like a passing thought.  Witherspoon is at her utmost best, and her performance redeems the film  from its lack of focus and guidance, but it still leaves you wanting a  better sense of closure. So if you are a fan of Witherspoon, hikes, or  nature, this movie is exactly what you need.",Wild
143,LivBrumei,Review of life,9,26 April 2015,"These type of movies, like Into the Wild as well, come to me as a review of any common human being life nowadays. It doesn't mean that you need to have the exact problems that the characters have, but the movie will make you wonder about how you're doing and how much importance are you really giving to the things that matter the most. This was Wild to me. I took some time to see it, but now I regret not doing it early. It's amazing and shows how important and how difficult it is, sometimes, to get a moment to understand ourselves and how most of those times that's where our problems live and sustain. It's a great movie with a simple story and simple characters. It won't take long for you to understand it, but it's full of meaning and with a touch of adventure sponsored by nature which makes it beautiful to watch. I certainly recommend. For me it was quite surprising, I thought it would be a bit boring and not very different from some movies of the same kind, but it is and if you like the kind of movies to make you wonder about life, this one is certainly inspirational!",Wild
144,rdolan9007,"A personal journey of 'discovery', but avoids obvious traps of sentimentality and mawkishness.",8,31 August 2019,"I had hummed and hawed over watching this film or not. I couldn't quite remember if I had heard good things about it or not. I think I may have done, so decided to give it a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised, and surprised that I engaged with the story so much. I knew and liked Reese Witherspoon from her earlier movies: the cheerful 'legally blonde', the clever film 'Pleasantville', and perhaps the best of the lot the political satire, set in a school, in the film called 'election'.This film is the true story based on the book by Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) the main character in the film. She is undertaking an arduous and occasionally dangerous hike, alone, along the Pacific coastal trail (PCT); a 1200-ish mile walk in all. The main reason for her hike is to try and come to terms with the death of her mother, and recover in body and mind from her resultant drug abuse and unhealthily sexualised response to that grief.Her past relationship with her mother and her often drug addled sexual encounters are shown in flashback (no pun intended, even if it would have been a good one). These flashbacks never jar though, and really give an insight into her pain, and what she is trying to get away from in her particularly dark past. Laura Dern who plays her mother gives a very warm performance - one that in less skillful hands could have been soppyish. Her performance works though, and you understand the pain, her mother went through, trying to deal with an abusive, alcoholic husband.The direction by Jean-Marc Vallée, while perhaps a little too restrained, despite the scenery that was obviously on offer, does a good job of keeping the multi-stranded story coherent and involving. The script by Nick Hornby probably deserves a lot of the credit for this, as well. It would have been so easy to get the pacing wrong, and make a two hour film of someone hiking feel like an eternity. Yet I was never bored in this film. Reese Witherspoon shows herself capable of taking a tough role on, and while she doesn't need to be that exceptional in the role, she is plenty good enough to take you along with her..Although men do play at times a significant part in her hike, both in flashback and along the hike itself, this is not really a story about them. The film depends on the performances of both Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon to keep your attention. They succeed in doing so..",Wild

146,AStormOfSwords13,Nature Calls,7,12 May 2015,"While a biography wouldn't be the first thing that comes to mind to watch, there was something about this movie that was calling me to watch it. After waiting a long while, just staring at the cover art and being interested by the trailer, I finally get around to watching Wild. From what I got, would it make me want to hike a trail? Maybe, though the nearest one to me is the Appalachian Trail, which I have been to, but have never really tried to hike the whole trail since I was only there due to a trip to Bear Mountain. So I guess it would inspire me to hike the Appalachian Trail in a way that I can see how such a long trek can really make a person grow.The Pacific Crest Trail, the trail Cheryl Strayed hikes, is a trail that goes from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-Canada border, but I noticed one major flaw with the plot of the movie in relation to real life: the movie clocks the PCT at 1,100 miles, but according to Wikipedia, the PCT really goes on for over 2,500 miles, and bikers can go on for about 2,700 miles. I haven't looked up the Bridge of the Gods though, so maybe I'm the knucklehead who's wrong here. Let's move on.Throughout the movie, as Cheryl is hiking, many flashbacks are shown to illustrate what Cheryl's life was like in the past. It takes a while to figure out how it relates to the plot and how it is all connected to how Cheryl ended up hiking such a long trail in the first place. When it does though, while it makes Cheryl more rounded as a character and someone I could synthesize with, I found that I couldn't care less about any other character in the movie, not even her own mother.This movie does not hold back on nudity more than it needed to not be an NC-17 movie as sex ends up being a factor in Wild. Reese as Cheryl shows her nipples very early on in the movie and she is naked in several scenes in the movie. Thankfully, these aren't useless outside of something to jerk off to and instead does correlate to the story being told in the film. Also in the movie is blood and bruises, which is a very real part of long distances. I know this from experience because sometimes when I need to walk several miles to a train station on the way home from work, I would find blisters on my foot. Because of this, I connect with Cheryl and appreciate this movie that much more.Other than the frequent misjudging of distance and inadequate supporting character development, the film's other notable flaw may be its relative slow pacing, especially at the beginning. This movie isn't for people who are looking for something fast- paced, but if you can connect with Cheryl as a character, this movie will be worth your time. One nice touch is pictures of the real Cheryl at the end of the film. It also doesn't make the normal biography cliché of writing on- screen what happened to the characters after the end of the movie. Instead, it is narrated, which I thought was cool.Wild is a movie that requires patience to enjoy, but if you can appreciate its purpose, it becomes a powerful film.",Wild
147,pjlb2008,lukewarm,5,2 October 2015,"Reese Witherspoon, a likable, pretty person, stars in a fairly dull adventure. She always looks like a movie star. She is never grubby or disgusting. If the main character was not someone with star power like hers, this story would be unwatchable. Boiled down, this is a series of rather mundane challenges the heroine faces in her walk. She crawls over some big rocks. At time, she deals with heat. Another time, she walks through some snow. She has to drink, drum role please, dirty water, yes dirty water! Once, she is not sure what State she is in; she has to ask some skiers where she is ... Crazy! That's losing yourself, I guess.The danger of rape would be real and concerning on a trip like this. There are a few set-ups for ominous threats of assault. One, early in the movie, is a false alarm, where she misreads a good soul. Another time is genuinely frightening.One finds the heroine was remarkably pampered along the trip. She gets packages of goods sent to her by her ex-husband at the places she stops. She gets a lot of help from people along the way. She rides with people in vehicles at times! The pain she is ""running from"" in her personal life is not different than that of a lot of people face.

The portrayal of what a long distance hike takes was unrealistic and oversimplified. You do not go out unprepared and you do not just scamper over three boulders or teeter over 4 feet of slippery logs crossing a creek. The trails are fraught with many dangers from man, beast and nature. This made it look like a long hot afternoon walk. Perhaps the real woman's experience was better accounted for in her journals and subsequent book but the movie did nothing to convey her personal struggle to complete a thousand mile trek...But what left me MOST disappointed and shaking my head....was when they managed to insert a blatant plug for REI right in the middle of the movie woven right into the dialog...(""You mean they'll send me a brand new pair of boots??

151,cuthbertjoel,Missed The Mark For Me,2,21 February 2015,"When you have a film that is so heavily reliant on a single character, it's so important to make that character likable or relatable.I'm a big Reese Witherspoon fan and have been for a while, but I think she's got it all wrong in this film. Within a few minutes, I was already sick of the bad attitude and whining of her character. She turned up for a 1000 mile trek with 12 condoms, hardly any water and the wrong fuel for her stove.I didn't care about the character, and because of the way the films timeline is set out, you only get information in small flashbacks (which is annoying). This all means that you don't fully discover why this trek is being done until over an hour into the film. By that time I'd already mentally checked out and couldn't care less about the back story.I'm not certain what this film is supposed to be. It fails as a self-discovery film as the character who is supposed to be a recovering sex addict sleeps with one of the first guys she sees on the trek. It also fails as a survival movie as no less than 8 days into a 'character building wilderness trek' is our character hitching a ride back to a man's house to have a hot dinner and shower??? As with most reviewers, I can admit the scenery is beautiful and the film is reasonably well shot. Although I suppose they couldn't go too wrong with the PCT as a backdrop. But even the physical aspects of the film don't add up. Reese has no sun tan/burn after weeks in the baking sun. Her hair certainly doesn't resemble the hair of someone who has been trekking for weeks.I'm not an avid walker but I think I can bet my last dollar that the film is about as accurate to trekking as 'Vertical Limit' was to climbing.In the film's defence, it may be closely following the book that it is based upon.

I had someone actually talk me out of seeing this movie because they heard it wasn't good, but then another friend told me she did want to see it and hadn't really paid any attention to reviews. I thought good. I will go see with this person instead since they haven't been influenced by outside opinions. Saw this today and absolutely loved it. Thought it was an incredible story of courage, bravery and redemption. Thought Reese was incredible and the flashback scenes with her mom touching and heartbreaking. There are so many beautiful scenes that will touch your heart including the little boy who sings to her. There are also hilarious scenes such as the man who rights for Hobo Magazine and insists on calling her a hobo. Her encounters with other hikers and people on her journey reminded me of the movie ""into the wild"" though she actually survives. Don't think that's a spoiler since obviously she had to live to write the book. Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, but I and my friend both truly enjoyed it thoroughly.",Wild
153,Skeauxsha,Sometimes you just have to go somewhere to scream,8,15 December 2015,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started to watch this film, and since it seemed like it would be a lame female empowerment movie. I started out pessimistic from the outset. (much like Cheryl) I was wrong. Okay, female empowerment sure, but the struggle, and journey (1,100 miles) to put life experiences in perspective? Admirable. From the opening sequence the filmmakers baited the hook. Alone on a mountain, and needing a rest (what happened next made even me wince). After that I had to see just what the heck happened to this woman, what was her story? (Fish On) One personal tragedy after another, piling up in layer upon layer until her pillar was removed. Spiraling down, down, down... enough. I'm going to hike the PCT (Pacific Coast Trail) alone.Everyone goes through tragedy, life is that way. Ironically, taking life in any facet for granted for too long is a tragedy. Unfortunately, it's never realized until way past too late.When Cheryl finally realizes that she has gone past way too late, she does what very few women do. She seeks a solitude on a quest that at the time seems un-surmountable. Then step by step, mile by mile, day by day, she finds out just what it takes to find true independence, and reliance on one's own self. With no one to blame for what happens but herself.Watching Cheryl's transformation from the beginning of the film to the end was revealing. All the forgivable mistakes she makes throughout the hike definitely hit parallels that anyone would make.The film from start to finish is very well put together, and the entire cast nailed it. I have to admit I was surprised by the sex scenes as this isn't really the way Reese Witherspoon has been presented in the films I have seen her in. That said, her performance wasn't tarnished, and didn't falter. Reese was very straightforward and believable.Personally I admire Cheryl Strayed, and her choice to pit herself against the wilderness in order to find some kind of inner peace. I did the same when my wife of 12 years passed, and continue my own hike every year on her birthday. Cheers to you Cheryl, and Cheers to the Cast of Wild...",Wild
154,andy-66447,"""Wild"" Is Another Great Vehicle For Witherspoon",8,24 August 2015,"One of the great songs on Simon & Garfunkel's landmark 1970 album ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" is ""El Condor Pasa."" Based on a Peruvian folk melody, ""The Condor Passes,"" it's the song which features the line, ""A man gets tied up to the ground He gives the world its saddest sound its saddest sound."" Had music videos existed in 1970, I've often wondered what a video for ""El Condor Pasa"" would look like. Would it depict a condor soaring majestically over a city whose inhabitants labor away without realizing the grandeur above them? Would it show a man breaking free of the proverbial chains of his life to begin a new journey? I think I've found the answer. Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Wild"" stars Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl Strayed, an author who, in 1995, walked all 1100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail – a hiker's dream path, surmounting the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges through California, Oregon, and Washington. As the movie unfolds (to the periodic aural beauty of Simon & Garfunkel), we simultaneously learn Strayed's backstory, and the reason why she decided to embark on such an arduous undertaking. I can't give away much information here without ruining ""Wild"" for you, but suffice to say Strayed was at a turning point in her life.As Strayed, Witherspoon (already a Best Actress winner for 2005's ""Walk The Line"") gives the best performance of her career. She's sturdy and headstrong, yet occasionally vulnerable, and always focused on her task. As she meets various residents and travelers along the way, the first part of her life is told in a series of flashbacks. Typically I don't like to see directors rely too heavily on flashbacks. I figure if the present-day story is interesting enough, the actors can simply communicate their histories to one another as part of the screenplay dialogue. But here, flashbacks are necessitated by the fact that Strayed spends most of her hiking hours alone with her own thoughts. This is perhaps the one time I've seen such heavy use of the flashback technique where the recollections seem to flow naturally from the script. Fortunately, the present-day story (read ""The Hike"") is infused with such an array of interesting characters that I never felt like the backstory was predominant. In the sense that the script must find that perfect balance between present-day and past, Nick Hornby's screenplay is outstanding. Adapted from Strayed own memoir, I'd like to see Hornby win Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars.And Reese Witherspoon never ceases to amaze me. She's already one of our best actresses, and ""Wild"" is, so far, the apex of her career. She hits every note just right – from early frustration to later determination, Witherspoon's Cheryl Strayed is perhaps the most interesting character to appear in a film this year.The great irony of ""Wild"" for me is that while the panoramic views of the beautiful countryside become more breathtaking as the picture progresses, the more claustrophobic I felt. In other words, the more I learned about Cheryl Strayed pre-hike life, the more I wanted her to fly away. If her hike was to be therapeutic, I wished she could soar like the proverbial condor of ""El Condor Pasa."" ""Wild"" depicts a temporary cessation in the troubled life of a woman who simply had to ""get away."" As the film drew to its conclusion, I wondered what the next chapter in her life would be. But ""Wild"" is so great, I never believed I had to know. Truth is, ""Wild"" is so complete there's nothing else I want, or need, to know about Cheryl Strayed's journey. I'm very glad I saw this film.",Wild
155,jenjentaro,A wild struggle,2,10 June 2016,"I was disappointed in the film. This is another reason why I should have never read the book before watching the movie. The film didn't do Cheryl Strayed's experience justice. The scenes were misleading and were not explained as to the reason why she did what she did. The internal monologues were grossly missing. I was quite disappointed with Reese Witherspoon's performance in this one. Her expressions were just so boring and on the surface. You see no dept in her portrayal of Cheryl. The movie also had a lack of supporting characters. In the book, the people Cheryl met on the trip, as well as their stories guided Cheryl and contributed to her growth. The movie brushed those important characters off and only focused on Cheryl's external actions.",Wild

Then I thought what should I expect from a biography? an Inspiration, I guess. But to be honest, I am also current in a situation which needs some change, I am not sure if going a such wild trip is a good idea. As in the movie, I think the protagonist got lucky. In a review, some say, marathon, I agree with that sort of challenging but not so dangerous.",Wild
157,miy66,Not just about a Big Hike!,8,2 February 2015,"I really liked this movie.. I must admit I thought it may be full of close calls with nature like animal/ bug attacks etc, but this wasn't that. The story is about Cheryl played by Reece Witherspoon journey of reflection on why her life has turned out in the negative way it has and how she can move forward and become the woman her mum thought she was or would be. I found the movie extremely watchable and the time flew for me as I was very engrossed. Reece is wonderful in the role in my opinion. Aside from Cheryl's mum passing away which is the catalyst for Cheryls change, you never fully understand the motivation for Cheryl's huge backward step in life. Laura Dern covers the role as Cheryl's mum Bobbi well, but without doubt the story focuses solely on the main characters journey. I really enjoyed this and really don't have any complaints. The toughness of such a journey is covered well, and the cinematography is wonderful. This is yet another go-see in a great lineup of summer movies!",Wild

It has perfection in everything - action (it has made me a Reese Witherspoon fan), plot, screenplay, background music, scenic beauty, inspiration, characterization, memory flashes.... Everything.... I can't resist to mention the following lines from the movie....And I didn't even know where I was going until I got there the last day of my hike. Thank you, I thought over and over again, for everything the trail had taught me, and everything I couldn't yet know. How, in four years, I'd cross this bridge. I'd marry a man in a spot almost visible from where I was standing. How, in nine years, that man and I would have a son named Carver, and a year later, a daughter named after my mother, Bobbi. I knew only that I didn't need to reach with my bare hands anymore. That seeing the fish beneath the surface of water was enough. That it was everything. My life, like all lives, mysterious, irrevocable and sacred. So very close. So very present. So belonging to me. How wild it was.... let it be.#mustWatch....",Wild
159,sammie-75089,as lame as a Lifetime movie,1,6 September 2015,"The film had its interesting moments but Witherspoon's horrible character she portrayed and the many flashbacks got in the way and interrupted the movie's flow. I found myself just not caring, liking or sympathizing with Witherspoon's character in the least. I mean, many people have rough, tragic lives but we all don't go off the deep end and become drug-addicted, foul mouthed, adulterous, disrespectful, promiscuous sluts. There is nothing noble or overcoming about this movie. It's a story about an unlikeable, mentally dysfunctional woman trying to resolve her problems by taking a hike.

160,ammabee-956-927043,Brilliant adaptation based on a brilliant person.,9,13 April 2015,"First ) I read the novel and it was phenomenal and I believe the movie was brilliantly done by someone who was WAY out of her comfort zone (Reese Witherspoon who is most known for movies like : Legally Blonde) and if she hasn't proved that she could be a serious actress in 'Walk The Line' she DEFINITELY proved it here. She took on a huge challenge and she surpassed all expectations. She did the job beautifully. Even though the lead actress did AMAZING, even the not so important cast (Laura Dern, who portrayed the Mom with cancer) was great. The acting was on point, and I believe that this movie is dreadfully underrated. It isn't ALL ABOUT THE HIKE, it's about the story. But, just saying : don't watch this with your family, the backstory has A LOT of inappropriate scenes (maybe not A LOT, but more than there had to be.) but, other than that, it was a great movie. ACTING - 9.5/10 - it was mainly just Reese that shined, but honestly, all of it was great.

This movie gets this point perfectly! But then again mistakes you make in the wilderness, where you have no one but yourself to depend on, are not usually made more than once.I have never thrown perfectly good boots off of the side of a mountain, but i have hiked back to a trail-head, wearing boots that were cobbled back together with duct tape and string.I thought that this film presented its story elegantly and with enough poetry that i found it quite fascinating.If you found this movie boring you would most definitely find backpacking boring - and more than likely i would find you very boring! :)",Wild
162,sivanandrao,A good attempt falls flat,6,6 February 2015,"This is not what I expected from the movie. I thought it will have much more grit and depth in the story telling. The start was good but as the movie progresses it looses direction. It is about a troubled girl's life who is in drug trouble, sex addiction and what not due to her recent loss. She takes on this Pacific Crest trail (Hike) to set her mind straight and get back to who her mother wanted her to be. A good act from Reese Witherspoon who seems to have given it her all. But unfortunately the story telling and editing are a big let down. After watching movies like ""Into the Wild"", this movie seems to be a bit far stretched. Some unwanted scenes like the CGI fox and some explicit scenes could have been avoided. Some times the story telling seems to miss the end point. Can watch it for Reese's performance, Scenery and maybe some basic tips of hiking. Can be watched but will not miss much if skipped.",Wild

I wanted her to make it. I watched her suffer and rage and fall to pieces. Then i watched her get up, dust off and take on another day. I was this woman and I wanted to make it to. Reese Witherspoon as always gave it her all. The only reason it dropped a point was some of the writing was far too small and squiggly for me to read so I had to pause it to check what it said.

165,blinkchester,Prepare For a Journey,7,28 March 2015,"Here we have a movie that exemplifies exactly what makes a journey. We have the actual journey, 93 days and 1100 miles. We have the means which is hiking along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). We also can look at the emotional path taken, coming to terms with traumatic events and heading towards self-discovery.The cinema experience in itself is a journey. We travel to the pictures while opening our minds as we are taken into a distorted reality. Escaping our own world and allowing the auteur to take control of our minds. In Wild we can share that journey with Reese Witherspoon. Based on the memoirs of Cheryl Strayed about her hike along the PCT, Wild was adapted for the big screen by Nick Horny of High Fidelity and Fever Pitch fame.Reese Witherspoon fully deserved her Oscar nomination for leading this movie. Likable yet ambiguous as Strayed, Witherspoon is able to capture the demons from Strayed's past, yet have the audience empathise with her circumstances. She effectively transitions from the green under prepared hiker to the tough worldly achievement. A character who feels that all the beauty has gone out of the world, falls to her knees in a touching scene when she achieves self-discovery. It is fair to say, that sometimes to move forward, you have to break yourself right down.Is it a voyage of self-loathing? Punishment? Adventure? Possibly a test of endurance? A testament to the reality portrayed here is that lines are blurred. Life is a journey, you meet many interesting characters along the way, but in the end you must realise that you are responsible for your own actions.You will not lose interest in this film as you grow with the character. This is not an advertisement for hiking, the hike could be represented in many ways. Give this one a chance, the journey is worth it.",Wild
166,therocksbarneyreviews,"""Wild"" has a fantastic story and a good lead in Reece Witherspoon who by the end of the film is seemingly synonymous with the character she plays.",8,15 January 2015,"I remember when I was watching ""Wild"" that I suddenly realised that I wasn't walking beside the films protagonist Cheryl Strayed, but was in fact watching her being played by Reese Witherspoon. But this wasn't just because of how immersive the cinema screen is and how it made me feel like I was experiencing Strayed's story first hand, but it was also how, using Strayed's hike as the guide leading us through the film, ""Wild"" uses Strayed's internal monologue as a way of letting the audience see what led to Strayed to embark on such a terrific feat. This fluent style matches that of the book the film is based on, ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"". It was also Witherspoon's performance that drew me in to the film, and by combining that with the inevitable landscape shots that are going to feature in a film like this, I suddenly realised that I had been walking beside Strayed/Witherspoon as the film had gone on.Strayed's story is tragic, yet from that spouts inspiration. But ""Wild"" doesn't do it in a way where that is clear, in fact Strayed frequently asks herself what on earth she is thinking doing this. Instead, again by sticking to the style of its source material, ""Wild"" leaves you realising a day or two later that the past isn't something that is best to discard and forget about, but is instead something that we should take on board and use as a way to become a better person. Again, something that isn't so obvious about ""Wild"" is how you find yourself rooting for Strayed, but not in the sense of how I was just about resisting the urge to scream out in the cinema as if she was some sort of superwoman, but instead in a way where Strayed genuinely, and deservedly, had my sympathy. Reece Witherspoon is one of many people to thank for this. She is brilliant in ""Wild"" and it's great to see her in something rather than, what I thought was her recent work, ""This Means War"", that cringing spy flick where Chris Pine and Tom Hardy fight over her. Yet what ""This Means War"" can be thanked for in regards to ""Wild"" is how Witherspoon doesn't leave that comedy behind and where there is a chance for humour, she takes it, again leading me to laugh out loud, for example in a scene where she is mistaken for a hobo. But then, once I'd finished laughing, I'd be left with an important question about Cheryl Strayed. Is she homeless? These sort of questions give Strayed your sympathy, and deservedly so. Cheryl Strayed, for her story, and Reese Witherspoon, doing justice for Strayed in regards to her story, can both be thanked in regards to this.We can also thank the film's director, Jean-Marc Vallée, following on from his previous effort ""Dallas Buyers Club"". Whereas I didn't really like his previous film, I feel that ""Wild"" was better suited to him. Although there is that same pale shade over the camera as there was in ""Dallas Buyers Club"", Vallée captures some fantastic landscape shots and what's important to note is how it's not just the scenery that makes them truly fantastic, but it's the subject of them, Strayed/Witherspoon, that does so. Where there is a view of some snowy mountains, we can see a figure making her way down them. Vallée does this in a different way in ""Dallas Buyers Club"", and it explains why Matthew McConaughey in that film and Reese Witherspoon in this get so much attention for their respective roles. This makes it difficult for supporting actors and actresses to get some of the limelight, but again another strong performance by Laura Dern (playing Barbara ""Bobbi"" Grey, Cheryl's Mother) manages to take some of it, though not as much as Jared Leto did in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" last year. But I suppose it is difficult for Dern to take some of the spotlight in a film that does focus on one woman's struggle, whereas ""Dallas Buyers Club"" focused on that of a whole community.""Wild"" is ultimately a great film and its story, propelled forward by Reece Witherspoon, who by the end of the film I found to be synonymous with Strayed, is both tragic and terrific. Vallée can be thanked for this too. At one point in the film Witherspoon/Strayed comments how she feels more alone at home than out here in the wild. This captures what ""Wild"" is as a film, and although it doesn't teach you anything directly, it rather encourages you to look at what Strayed did and to try and not find yourself in that position.",Wild
167,finebeanies,The characters did not connect with me but the solo trek is beautiful,6,20 January 2015,"The story had all the elements that could be made into a great movie: an inspiring journey of a woman dealing with a loss, a long walk through the wilderness to seek a fresh start, adventures on the way, encounters with different characters and the beginning of a new chapter in her life. I was interested in seeing how this story translates into a movie.Unfortunately the movie did not connect with me. The storytelling was done through flashbacks with insufficient background that would explain the motives or develop the characters. As the story unfolds, tidbits of events from the past that drove Cheryl Strayed to embark on this journey stay unexplained, such as her relationships with her brother and with her husband and how she came to the decision to get off heroin and to prepare for this trek. Also her internal struggles are not quite clear. Moments of strength are followed with moments of weakness, such as when she asks a farmer to drive her for a hot meal and a shower. And some moments simply make no sense, such as when she is on a snowy mountain with skiers zipping by her and she is yelling ""Where am I?""Reese Witherspoon's acting was excellent but that could only carry the movie so far when the characters lack substance and the dialog feels contrived. I much preferred the movie ""Into the Wild"" which was portraying a similar journey.The landscape of the trek is beautiful and the experience of a solo walk is worth seeing.

169,junkmail-385,Incredible!,5,14 January 2015,"That would be ""incredible,"" as in ""not credible"". Toting a 70 pound pack for a few days is a major chore for an experienced, fit, male hiker. Doing it as an inexperienced, unfit, recovering heroine addict wearing duct tape sandals is ridiculous. In the book, Strayed uses duct tape only (no sandals), but I guess that was considered just TOO incredible for the movie. In my opinion the book is most likely concocted from tales told by people Strayed encountered on a much shorter journey along the PCT and from reading others' accounts, not wholly or maybe even mostly from personal experience. Even in 1995, more people traveled the PCT than is depicted. Instead of the Queen of the PCT, Strayed seems more like the Ghost of the PCT. Witherspoon's acting is good, although the pack she carries never seems more than about 35 lbs. and Strayed is not a likable character. My takeaway is that taking heroine is a good thing. Just look at the incredible times we're all missing! Too bad almost none of the movie was shot on the PCT.",Wild

Yet she becomes extraordinarily strong and self aware. This film will challenge what and how you believe a woman should behave.

Coming to terms with grief can take many roads and Cheryl embarks on one of self-imposed isolation and physical burden. Her path is filled with obstacles but she never lets that get in her way, instead forging forward without a real end in sight. Reese is brilliant as Cheryl and Laura shines as her ailing Mother. He dealings with others from her past as well as new people she befriends on her journey all add to the real feel of this film. It feels natural, not Hollywood. It has no need to rely on fake action or heroics. Just the portrayal of a real person, with a real life and struggles.

It just comes out that way. Not that movie making is just dumb luck. And how this is done is a mystery to me and probably every one else as well.It is interesting to see this man (woman) against nature and self real life story develop and play it self out against the scenic backdrop of the ""Pacific Crest Trail"" that becomes an intricate part of the story as much as the different characters mostly the main character who I could not help but identify with on more than one level.If Ms. Witherspoon and the director can communicate this much than a very good job indeed has been done making this film well worth the admission price.I checked the Oscar nominations today as I wrote the above yesterday and indeed the performance of one Reese Witherspoon is nominated for best actressGood idea as I think she will win again!Hope she does.Still don't get that fox thing though.",Wild

I am extremely glad for it. This movie is very inspiring, has a strong message and has a lot of heart in it. Aspire to be your best self no matter what life throws at you. This message will never get old because each of us suffers from a severe case of ADD and suffers from memory loss, forgetting most of the things we decide to do with our lives. Thus, we need to be reminded of it continuously. It is challenging but it is worth it since that is our only goal in our life.Cheryl is a flawed character, like all of us, lost in the tiny space that was her life. She tried to cope with it by denying it, escaping for it for some long years. But like every action you take she suffered their consequences, and gave up her faulty ways in the end. Now she was empty, filled with guilt for her choices, wanting desperately to feel something different but couldn't. She decided to do something extremely challenging which she had no idea about to discover something different in her life. With hope of a new future, she embarked on the untraveled road leaving behind everything familiar to her. She lost her faith in herself many times along the way but never gave up her decision to see it through the end. She realized that despite all the challenges she faced, she was still here. All the things that happened to her had led her to this place. She had faced her deepest fears and realized that they don't hold her back anymore. Just the decision to face them had set her free as if they were nothing but an illusion in her head preventing her from going ahead. Forgiving herself for everything she had done, she rediscovered herself unbounded, invulnerable and ready to face anything this mysterious life throws on her. This was beautiful, and the director conveyed this tall task convincingly with the help of stellar performance from all the actors, the cinematographer, and amazing music developers.",Wild

180,jaclyn-144-759583,"A great mix of beauty, pain, courage, fear and something all of us struggle with, forgiveness.",7,3 December 2014,"I'll admit  this movie is much better than expected. The trailer turned me off a bit — it seemed like a long, boring movie that would bring me back to 127 Hours again. No thank you.I was pleasantly surprised. Yes this is a story about one woman's journey across our amazing country. It is also a story about the people around her — the people she interacts with for minutes, months and milestones. It's not merely a woman walking for two hours on the screen  it's a great mix of beauty, pain, courage, fear and something all of us struggle with, forgiveness.While I was suspect of the movie, I was not worried about Reese Witherspoon giving us a great performance. First of all — how it is possible this woman looks great in EVERYTHING!?!? As Elle Woods in Legally Blonde she wore pink to perfection. In Walk the Line she pulled off classic country in a way that even Dolly would have to say is pretty fabulous. And as Cheryl Strayed I left the theatre feeling like I needed to run to REI and pick up a pair of hiking boots and gray socks! Folks are debating online if she is one of America's sweethearts  in my opinion  she defines it. You can't help but like her. And if you aren't a Reese fan, check out Wild just to see her in this anti-Elle Woods role. I believe you will gain some respect for her.Over the last 24 hours I was wondering if I would recommend this as a movie for you to pick when it's your turn. Yes. It's a great movie. Yes. Men can handle it (though I'm sure they will whine as you drag them there). Yes. You'll walk away with your heart tugged and perhaps a tear or two. So yes  I do recommend Wild if it is your turn to pick. If you love someone, lost someone, are searching for someone — there is a strong chance this movie will unexpectedly strike that chord. Why? Because Wild does a wonderful job sharing a life story all of us can relate to in someway. This isn't a Hollywood blockbuster script — it's a script about everyday life that always isn't pretty. The guy doesn't always get the girl. The dreams don't always come true. Answers aren't just straight ahead. All of us have a Wild story in our life  spending two hours watching Cheryl share hers is well worth your time and money.",Wild

The movie is directed in a fragmented way that does not serve the story in any way. We cannot get to know this woman --her journey from the lowest depths to some sort of epiphany because to this fragmentation. We are kept at a distance from her transformation by the choice of the director. And it hampers the development of the character. There is no way into this movie and ultimately it becomes tedious. There is no depth and not enough character development for us to care about this woman's journey. The supporting cast also suffers from this fragmentation. In every way it lacks the intensity and realism that the directory brought to DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. You won't find that kind of honesty in this film. Many scenes seem almost ""stock"".",Wild

The scenery in the movie is gorgeous! It is an inspirational movie. I did not take away some of the same feelings as other reviewers did about everyone trying to attack her all the time or she traded her body for help. I am not sure where those viewers got that from. To be honest, I will always love the movie, ""The Way"" best for this type of genre. Even though, ""The Way"" is fiction I was much more touched, moved, and inspired by the content of that film.

183,joeyajames-555-640684,Reese at her best! Awesome Film!,9,16 May 2015,"Where to start? Of course with Reese. She's more than a lead character. She holds nearly as much screen time as Tom Hanks in Castaway or Robert Redford in All is Lost, and she captivates the viewer equally well. She's stunningly beautiful, so that doesn't hurt, but she really holds your attention. You feel her struggles, her pain, her joy because she draws you into the movie. All her (Cheryl's) perfections and imperfections are revealed piece-meal throughout the film. Even her mom turned out to be an amazing person. What an outstanding performance by Reese. Why didn't she win best actress? I was shocked in the early scenes to see her stuffing her pack with brand new gear. Clearly she was not a hiker at all. But her determination alone carried her forward, and she somehow survived. The several creepy tense sexual situations kept us in touch with the realities she faced as an attractive young lady in the wild. And interestingly enough, she looks a lot like the real Cheryl, so I could totally see her having to deal with all those tough situations. The scenery along the trail was spectacular. All in all, this is a film I don't think anyone should miss. It's Reese Witherspoon at her best, true to the real story from what I can tell, inspiring, and fascinating. I will definitely be watching it again. And if you like this and want to see a similar film, check out The Way with Martin Sheen; it has a similar plot, though I think I prefer Wild.",Wild

Seems Hollywood, as it is: could even be Disney. Into the wild was totally different and have a good script. Even if it is a true story, read the damn biographies: is so so easy... did she actually walk for 3 months? how many miles did she do by car? Furthermore, all the beautiful sentences comes from books. She just add one and seems like a heroine? I miss so so much the true feelings of Into the wild and also the respect for the true story.

186,info-21405,Emotional Story about Overcoming & Healing,8,18 July 2020,"I enjoy books and movies about self-discovery and personal change. Throw in a beautiful destination and a strong female as the main character and I'm definitely in. So, as soon as Cheryl Strayed's novel came out in 2012, I read it.
And then two years later when the movie came out, I watched it, too. I didn't remember much about the movie, so recently decided to watch it again.And I'm glad I did.I had forgotten what a powerful and emotional story is told in this movie. It's the true story of Cheryl Strayed, played expertly by Reese Witherspoon, as she hikes 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. That alone is a feat to be examined and would make for an interesting travel story, but this movie (and Cheryl's trek) is more than just a physical journey--it is also an emotional journey.With the use of flashbacks, Wild helps us understand why Cheryl has decided to take on this monumental challenge all alone without any hiking experience or training--she needs to heal. Cheryl was close to her mother (played by another great actress, Laura Dern) and when her mother passed away unexpectedly, Cheryl went into a downward spiral.The movie is done well and, unlike many other adaptations, doesn't stray too far from the book. As is often the case, you do lose some of background story and you do lose some of the main character's emotional struggle...which means it's a little more difficult to connect to her and really understand her, her past, and her growth through the hike--the ending, then, is a bit abrupt and you don't fully appreciate just how far she's come and just how she found her strength to step off the trail and step back into real life.If you like hiking (especially if you're considering a thru-hike like the PCT) and movies about self-growth, you'll like this movie.",Wild
187,sohn717,SO much to appreciate,9,9 December 2018,"A story about a real-life woman carrying figurative and literal baggage while she hikes the Pacific Crest Trail on foot while processing her messy past... Wild is a very complex and nuanced portrayal of a real-life woman's external and internal journey.
This film can be so easily overlooked but there is so much to appreciate:
It is heavy, devastating, empowering, with great performances, directing and editing. If you enjoyed Big Little Lies, this will be up your alley; David E. Kelley is great at stitching together flashes of haunting memories in a surreal way that somehow manages to reveal a character's ghosts and their life's story without causing confusion and trusting his audience. Reese Witherspoon is killing the producer game, and this is the best acting performance I've ever seen from her.",Wild

What a discredit to the people who actually have and do. She couldn't fare more than minimally at ANY multiple day pack. Aside from that there is the typical plummet in artistic and virtuous content....and lets face it, it's pretty hard to be inspirational while being devoid of either. Tasteless (and beyond irrelevant to damaging character empathy) smut, drugs, shallow unimaginative rank language.....oh yay, what entertainment! Nope.

191,asbufra@yahoo.com,A real story written by a real woman,9,6 January 2015,"None of us gets through life free of fault or regretI see negative reviews that complain; the scenery is beautiful and Reese is beautiful and her acting is beautiful but the movie sucks because of the story. As if the movie fails because it is non fiction. It is a real story written by a real woman who has real problems just like yours and mine.The southern PCT is in my backyard and hiking is my passion. Everything she did, every mistake, every lesson learned, every expression, every post hole, every ""fucking rock"" comment was dead on. Frank: "" Do you ever think about quitting?"" Cheryl:""Only about every two minutes""When you hike long distances that is how it goes, if it doesn't suck a little you haven't pushed far enough. And then you sit atop a peak or beside a stream and watch a sunrise or sunset and it was all worth it. The battle is not with the snow, or the miles, or the snakes, or the slope, the battle is within.But: That is not what this movie is about, just as Huck Finn was not a book about rafting, This movie is not about hiking, it is about life and the trials we all pass, and yes some of our trials are self inflicted, that is life. Cheryl's book was about herself and she wrote it with total honesty. What does that tell you about her? You probably won't find a more honest person. She refuses to condemn herself for her own shortcomings. It's is all part of life, none of us gets through life free of fault or regret. It is not a fun movie, it is a thoughtful movie, thoughtful just as a 1,000 mile solo hike should be.Go see this movie and think!",Wild
192,alwaysdewright,Boring and upsetting at best,1,15 April 2015,"Fans of Cheryl Strayed likely come away from this movie feeling reasonably content with the outcome. There's no challenge to the end product or hope for anything more. Reese Witherspoon is a pretty personification that many can put their hopes and dreams and selves into and flutter away to the pretty pictures of mountains for a few fleeting moments in their day. For the rest of us, however, the movie is quite unmemorable and intangible. If anything, we simply watch Strayed (Witherspoon) walk around like an entitled, annoyed bitch for two hours, getting into trouble, doing stupid things, hurting anyone close to her, and then crying over spill milk again and again. And all along there's this audacious overtone telling us we should be feeling sorry for Strayed and her struggles give me a break.It's clear Jean-Marc Vallee wanted to produce an Oscar-season prospect, not an accurate or truly vulnerable adaptation. Coming off his success with Dallas Buyers Club, Vallee wanted to shift momentum to a prettier landscape and fill in the rest with exhausting flashbacks for back story. I can visualize what he was aiming for, and it could have been a shoe-in for best picture or certainly best actress. Unfortunately the end product missed the target by thousands of miles. Wild is tiresome, disjointed and certainly not Oscar-worthy material. The big difference between the two films is that Dallas was based on a tremendous story, one of transformation and growth, which is why it resonated so well with audiences. Wild is not a tremendous story, not even a good one, and simply takes the same approach as another vain diatribe, ""Eat Pray Love."" Essentially, a struggling female writer feels trapped in her life and decides to try something extreme, get herself out of this rut and find purpose (then shockingly decides to write a book about it and capitalize off all the people who want to do the same. CRAZY!). I won't argue that Strayed didn't have a rough go at it. With the death of her mother, her rotten coping mechanisms through anonymous sex and heroin use, the consequent failure of her marriage and the downward spiral of her life, Strayed was headed nowhere before she found the path of the PCT. But that does not excuse how ego-driven and basic Wild is (and is told).Strayed is the ugliest character in the story. Aside from a terrible voice-over at the end (seriously, WTF was that?), Strayed truly does not change physically, emotionally or in her relationships from beginning to end. Yet somehow the film goes out of its way to make her a hero, innocent and a victim in this crazy world around her. We see this when all the rangers, hikers, townsfolk, even customers at the diner she's waiting at all want to rape her or take advantage. Apparently every man in the 90s was absolutely horrible (even the husband she was cheating on who drove across the country to fetch her out of a drug den and save her life. Hrm). The most ironic part is how Strayed described in the book that she wanted to sleep with nearly every man that crossed her path (including most men on the trail), and at times she said she had to hold herself back. And that's the worst part of Wild, the blatant, phony feminist propaganda. Feminism is so trendy in pop culture right now that everyone is claiming they're a part of the cause. But it's a word that is completely misappropriated and misused, especially by quite terrible role models such as Cheryl Strayed. She is a woman who wants to desperately be considered a feminist that she adjusts her story to justify her mistakes, even throwing in the line, ""I am a feminist,"" into the movie to frantically convince us. But she's not. Being a selfish, inconsiderate asshole doesn't make you a feminist or a martyr. It makes you a selfish, inconsiderate asshole, and not a person the viewer should want to feel compassion for.To be honest, one of the best parts of the book was the relationships and perspectives of others who Strayed came across on the trail. We got to hear what they were going through, not just getting hit over the head by a whiny Witherspoon. Yet the theatrical version (again) only focuses on Cheryl and her theoretical struggle with life (i.e. herself). We totally skip over all the other people who in my opinion were the 'therapists' and friends who helped Cheryl to grow and guide her change into a new woman and move beyond her horrible past.If the story is intended to be one about personal growth and finding oneself, then there is none of that here in this adaptation. For a 15-minute montage Reese is bitching and moaning about hiking and her life, then suddenly we're at the end of the trek and she's telling us about how happy-ever-after things are going to be in the future. It was like Vallee just said, ""I'm over it,"" and decided to end the terrible experiment. By the end of this movie I find myself really caring less about Strayed (even distrusting her more since she signed off on this thing), and I'm insulted by her story and embarrassed that so many embrace her and what she did as some sort of feminist martyrdom. I think Strayed was a stupid girl who did stupid things, and out of sheer blonde luck was able to survive a trek on her own. Even more luck, she was able to turn that mediocre story into millions of dollars in her pocket. So good for her. It's not a terrible movie, just a terrible story about a terrible person who wants us all to believe she's a saint. I don't buy it, and unfortunately I rented the movie and bought the book.",Wild

Like she said in the end ""maybe i wanted to sleep with all those men"", yet she didn't wanted to talk with her mother in the beginning about casual se x, but doing all kinds of se xual things and not talking about them is a women cliché. Of course she wanted, but i do not know what she liked more?: luring them, seeing them fell so easy, or dumping them.(maybe some, fell in love with her, or had families).P.S.

Nevertheless, it is quite a thrilling ride, and if you ever went on a hike or a camping trip you will be more than able to immerse yourself in the world of the protagonist.What impressed me the most is the subtlety with which conflicts and crises are portrayed - direction really manages to pull you in and connect you with the main character.

197,DeanBenedetti,"The Female 'Into the Wild,' Only Better",10,24 December 2014,"Wild can be fondly compared to Jean-Marc Vallée's 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club in so many ways: both follow troubled drug/sex addicts on the road to self-discovery (whether they know it or not); both are poignant, intelligently visceral, funny, and undeniably realistic; both feature a great soundtrack of classic songs; and both are boosted by incredible performances by their lead actors. Wild is based off a memoir of the same name by Cheryl Strayed, who hiked over 1,000 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail in the mid 90s. Strayed, whose lived a seamy lifestyle full of drugs and promiscuity for far too long, sets off on this journey after the tragic loss of her mother to cancer. The road has many bumps along the way, especially for a young woman on her own, but Cheryl is fueled by her past and hopes to gain some perspective on her life through her arduous hike. This may not seem like the most original premise (person goes into the wilderness to find herself), but it is probably the best of its kind. If I were to sum up this movie in one sentence, it would be: It's like the female 'Into the Wild,' only better. Wild has the same kind of poetic, meditative approach but pulls it off far better in my opinion. While Cheryl is walking through the mountains or sleeping in her tent, the smallest thing she sees or hears will trigger something that happened in her past, usually something tragic. The audience is placed directly inside Cheryl's head and we travel back and forth with her in a stream-of-consciousness type of way that creates a seamless flow to the story. The way that Nick Hornby intertwined past and present is absolutely brilliant and is really the heart of the realism of the story. Another major factor in Wild's intrigue is the simple fact that the protagonist is a woman. I don't think I've ever seen a story of this kind told from a woman's perspective, through such a wary and disadvantageous lens. From her initially trying to lift up her monster of a backpack to her various encounters with questionable men, the viewer gets a first-hand look at what it's like to be a woman on her own. This leads to a number of chilling, tense, and unpredictable moments. Director Jean-Marc Vallée creates a visual atmosphere quite similar to his previous film; one that is up-close and intimate. Wild is not the most gorgeously shot film to take place in the wilderness, but that's because the intention of the director was to craft a human story, not a nature documentary. The editing, however, is superb and involved, yet not over-elaborate. Wild is obviously one of those film's that came together in post- production, and that's thanks to smart, nuanced editing by John Mac McMurphy and Martin Pensa. With Dallas Buyers Club, I think Matthew McConaughey fully realized his potential as a brilliant actor. I think the very same thing happened for Reese Witherspoon in Wild. She's an actress I've admired but never really been blown away by, that is, until now. Witherspoon runs through the whole gamut of emotions without once hitting a false note. It's a gritty performance to be sure, but she certainly deserves credit beyond simply starring in a grueling production like this. Reese shows raw emotion and sells the role far better that most Hollywood actresses could. She gives what is without a doubt my favorite work from any female actress all year. Wild totally came out of left field for me. I knew the talent behind it but I had no clue what an emotionally invigorating experience I was in for. Besides Birdman and Gone Girl, Wild is the only film from 2014 to actually have me in awe for the entire runtime. I truly loved every minute of it!",Wild

Regardless of what other reviewers have written, I understood the trials and life experiences as depicted by Reese Witherspoon. I did identify with many of the scenes in this movie, too. One must remember this trail hike took place in 1995, and not many women were into hiking or outdoor camping for that matter. Many of the movie's scenes ring so true to me. Especially, I felt the encounter with strange men with questionable intent was quite accurate as to their intent and the reaction depicted by Witherspoon.I had tears in my eyes at the end at the empathy generated by Witherspoon and Strayer's finding herself in the World dominated by men, but not so much now.",Wild
200,Cynical_Moi,Wildly Average,5,6 November 2021,"Here we go again with the one-word titles. This is just a little bugbear of mine, which is maybe a sign of old age. Namely, why do so many modern films (starting in the 90s I think) just package up their tour de forces with a one-word title - usually a very basic word at that - instead of coming up with something that powerfully and poetically captures the theme? Could this be because there isn't one, at least not a coherent one? To me it doesn't bode well; I mean, come on, 'wild' can be just anything. It's not that I'm against one-word titles per se. I mean, 'Unforgiven' - now that's deep, it's dark, and so is its movie. Try 'Everest' - you can't quibble with that, it's iconic, and so is the movie for the climbing genre. 'Wild', though - it's just bland and vague, and so is its movie.Okay, I get it: our supposed heroine has led a wild life and now she is 'in' the wild, ah yes how clever, how profound. No, it isn't. For a start, she was not so wild, not in any original or inspiring way anyway, but just a messy broken family kind of way. Now she's found long-distance walking - something which many (well, a fair minority) of us found and thrived upon without needing to be impelled to it by discovering that drugs and sex with many strangers didn't work for us (I'd be so lucky to have tried the latter). Mind you, she reverts back to that - what does this say? Was it one last shot just to prove what she already knew, or is to teach us that Michiel Huisman is just simply so the all-man type of man that a girl just has to open her legs? It seems to have got him the role of Queen Daenerys's bit of stuff at any rate.I should attempt constructive criticism, so, how about 'Trail of Redemption' (though perhaps redemption is a bit strong, as she wasn't exactly a wrong-doer in need of it, as the writers seemed at pains to tell us). How about ''Trail of the Soul' or 'Path of Life' (I like that because it analogizes a literal path with path in the sense of the one we are taking in life). Even - come on, the viewer is smart enough - 'Crest of Enlightenment' (Pacific Crest, get it? And on the cusp of finding oneself). Trouble is, the content would have to have the power and focus to match; let's just say I'm not going to seek out the book, unlike I once did for a certain James Dickey for a certain one-word (a meaningful one) John Voight film.",Wild

202,misty_77,How wild we are,10,23 January 2015,"Leaving the cinema after seeing this film I felt dismantled. I'd seen something beautiful, something that resonated deeply, something that maybe even had the power to transform. I've never done heroin. I've never slept around. I've never cheated on my spouse. But like Strayed I have felt the loss of a parent very deeply, and I am close to losing the other. Grief does strange things to you. I don't think I've seen a finer depiction of the guilt, self-loathing and depression that can accompany the loss of a loved one than you will see in this film. The film's strength lies in its editing. The flashbacks are handled with such a deft touch - brilliantly segueing into the past from the thoughts Cheryl has and the challenges she faces on the PCT. I think many of us will have gone on long hikes to try to grapple with all the noise in our head, so I found this process authentic. Predictably, this movie seems to have attracted its fair share of haters. A movie like this will never entertain viewers who need a lot of action to maintain their interest. The pace is slow. I can also understand that if you haven't had the right set of life experiences yet it may be hard to get behind Cheryl and be part of her journey. Some people will simply not understand the process of being healed by nature. Is that maybe an introvert thing? But I have difficulty understanding the need to label the main character a ""skank"" and to to denigrate the movie on this basis. Women make mistakes too, and it was so refreshing to see a depiction of a woman making some bad choices and then seeking redemption (even if - ultimately - such redemption was of itself perhaps illusory).

I did not find her likable or root for her. Despite the fact that her story of loss and subsequent self-destruction was compelling. I'm not sure if it was Reese Witherspoon's performance or the writing or both. It was at least in part because I thought the character was a total idiot largely unprepared for this journey. With a pack she could not carry and basic equipment she did not figure out how to use before her journey began. Whose foolish choices and lack of preparation could have and should have gotten her killed. Meanwhile, everyone cheers her on and/or wants to sleep with her. I also did not buy the relationship between Cheryl and her mother, played by Laura Dern--who seems to play the same character in every movie she's in.",Wild
204,KeithNg,"Boring at first sight, but impactful on second thought",7,6 February 2015,"Basically, this movie is not for the mass audience. It is condensed in a way such that only avid movie watchers will be able to stay awake and keep track. This movie surely isn't another typical film whereby they dramatise every small thing or that the movie is filled with climatic scenes such as running away from hungry predators. Instead, it flows through her encounters pretty quickly but not briefly. Unlike movies with similar style like Boyhood, this turned out to be quite dull and monotonous on first sight. However, thinking back now, some of the events still remained etched in my mind.The best trait of the movie was probably the way its played out. Instead of showing how Cheryl screwed up and then the hike, the movie focused mainly on the hike, but strategically showcasing flashbacks from time to time. The continuous bouncing between past and present was well played. Each time we entered her memory, it would somehow relate to what she was experiencing during the hike. Along the way scenes were put in place to help us her feelings better. This allowed my ""emotions' to follow hers throughout the movie.Some notable scenes like Cheryl eating her mothers ashes, shooting her moms horse,,, Such moments immediately catches you by heart again(thats if you're still awake and paying attention). Coupled with the exceptional acting from reese witherspoon and Laura Dern, the movie was quite enjoyable at parts. In conclusion, I would recommend you to watch this movie only when you're feeling sensitive/emotional and perhaps not too sleepy!",Wild
205,melittb,LOVE THIS MOVIE,8,5 September 2021,"One of my favorite movies. So emotive, harsh, inspirational, empowering, thought provoking, beautiful all at the same time.

206,strakl,Dare to be Wild?,8,15 February 2015,"Jean-Marc Vallée is a director who chooses direction with a special touch of delight. Human beings in his movies usually occupy an instrument, insane agony and the patient suffering, mental and physical. He brings new levels of animalistic instincts of survival on the screen and is lately quite successful with it. Wild (2014), Dallas Buyers Club (2013), Café de Flore (2011). Wild is a strong character fundament story, which is based on real life events. The main actress Witherspoon and her, to heavy backpack, are trying to overcome a 1100 mile long trail in the West of the states. It takes a lot more than a semigood story you would say. And you have right. The main storyline is quite interesting, but the plot has room for enrichment. Its not enough just to put a big backpack on a character as a psevdo representation of all accumulated fear, hate, and wrongdoing, while trying to resolve with hiking. Whiterspoon is done a great job and a weary impressive portrayal. Rich in emotional expressions and a vivid area of facial ""Drama Turism"". She is true and believable in racing her inner disorders. Life is sometimes full of false ideas and our nature can not wait to get on the path of probation. How much do we allow to push boundaries, are we brave and strong enough to go on adventures of our lives. Everything has its time and purpose, it depends whether we really want, the change.",Wild
207,dddmi7-1,It has to be experienced in a theater (spoilers kept to minimum),9,28 February 2015,"It's amazing how much hate and contempt this movie and the book it was adapted from has created on IMDb. I had the pleasure of seeing this at the Fleur Cinema in Des Moines prior to reading about the movie on IMDb. For some reason I connected immediately with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Cheryl Strayed...and through that performance felt a kinship with Ms. Strayed. Odd, as I assume she is someone I will never have the chance to meet in person. Perhaps it was associating with an underdog who perseveres. The cinematography captured me as I was lucky to have spent summers in the area around the PCT and was stationed nearby as well in my early twenties. I never imagined myself actually hiking the entire trail John Muir style. I could drive from trail to trail in my trusty automobile with a wallet full of Navy pay and drive back to civilization and sleep on a nice safe spongy Navy bunk. The film as a whole: the combination of directing, filming, acting, brought to me just how difficult it would be to attempt to hike the majority of the PCT. Just the courage to begin the journey was awe inspiring to me. I personally still can't believe Ms. Strayed actually did this, to me it's a monumental achievement...something I'd be proud of my entire life. That she undertook this journey after suffering so many tragedies and personal misfortunes in her life is even more impressive in my opinion. If you view the forum on here you'll encounter many people who don't understand why this film or book were ever created. Obviously these people have absolutely no clue what it takes to undergo such a mission, or journey, or life experience...whatever you choose to call it. To me, the end of the film, where Ms. Strayed comes out on the other side and experiences with what I believe is pure joy, relief, and peace is the reason for the film to be made. I don't really care what other people feel, it's Ms. Strayed's story...I just hope she was as pleased with the film and Ms. Witherspoon's portrayal as I was.I may be an old dude, but I hope to one day walk the same trail with friends...albeit on a slower time frame. Just so I can see and experience what she did, and find out about myself some of what she came to realize at the end.",Wild
208,pedro_wp,Nice story but awful acting,2,6 April 2020,"The story is ok, the directing is nice, but Reese Witherspoon has no charisma at all in this movie, I cant feel empathy for her, actually I cant feel anything about her character. Laura Dern's character is good, shame that we see so little of it, a pure mom that discovered true happiness after leaving her abusive husband and raising her kids on her own, but the kids dont give a damn to her, I believe thats and acting problem, or maybe she wants to look happy after all that trouble. It seems like this movie wants to be a mix of Into the wild, Walter Mitty and Demolition, but it fails completely",Wild

210,Rehmeiers-Moviebox,The long walk of redemption,8,3 September 2015,"Remember Resse Witherspoon in Walk The Line? Remember how she blew the world away as June Carter? I almost forgot as well, so I give thanks to Wild for reminding me just how good, believable, strong, independent, insecure and vulnerable Reese Witherspoon can portray a character. In Wild she takes on the part of Cheryl Strayed, a woman dealing with depression and sorrow after much personal tragedy. Cheryl lost her mother way to early with led her to a downward spiral of sex, drugs and sex with sleazy men. She decides to cleanse herself by embarking on a hike on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail).The movie belongs to Reese Witherspoon in what may ultimately be the best part of her career. Witherspoon is uncompromising in her portrayal of a woman who made many mistakes and now seeks redemption which she is ultimately the only one who can provide.Along with a strong performance from Laura Dern and beautiful cinematography, Wild is one of the best movies of 2014. A poetic, sad and crushing film about loss and sorrow but also about hope and personal victories. Highly recommendable.",Wild
211,shaye22,"The audiences didn't get it, but the critics did. Amazing journey.",10,24 April 2015,"This is an exceptional film on every level. It is well acted, breathtakingly shot and deeply personal. Audiences on IMDb are either really, really stupid or have just grown too accustomed to action flicks like The Avengers where an explosion or fight happens in every second scene. If you go to films to see mindless violence (and why would you?!), then avoid Wild. This film is for people who feel things deeply, who have been down life's tough road and understand a thing or two about not only beauty, but also grief or loss. I could harp on and on about why people on IMDb didn't ""get"" it, but I don't want to waste my time. It's evident looking at a lot of the 1 star reviews and seeing how these people are a few cards short of a plank, no offense to them. The strengths of this film lie within the fact that it never tries to ""tie up the ends"" or offer tacked on solutions. There is ambiguity and unanswerable questions, just like life. Why do we grieve? Why do we only realize what we had when it's slipped through our fingers? Why do we go to the darkest of places to realize something might be wrong? Why do some of us heal, and others don't? Wild isn't really a tale of healing, it's more of a fragment of the long, hard process of coming to heal. We don't have a beginning where everything is fine and dandy, a middle where things get tough, and an ending where those things are resolved. We only learn why this woman has put herself in the wilderness through fractured memories and flashbacks. The more we learn, the more we realize what she's trying to achieve. As her journey progresses and draws nearer to the end, the darker and painful memories seep through. It's a subdued and understated film, there's very little melodrama or big ""throw your arms up in the air"" scenes. It's quiet, but reflective and full of emotional complexity. Witherspoon has always been a competent actress. I remember knowing she had a bright future when I saw her in ""Freeway"" and later ""Election"", where she out-acted both Keifer Sutherland and Matthew Broderick, respectively. She absolutely shines here in a return to former glory after years of ""playing it safe"" in silly Hollywood romantic comedies. Laura Dern is a revelation too, giving all she can in such very little screen time. If Patricia Arquette hadn't had the Best Supporting Actress Oscar lock for her memorable turn in ""Boyhood"", I'm sure that little gold man would be Dern's. The cinematography is rich and vast. The soundtrack is superb, probably one of the greatest in recent memory. Deadheads and grunge junkies will love it. Wild is a remarkable journey. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, because it requires an IQ prerequisite to be appreciated.",Wild

Big little lies ain't my type of series, more a typical show for women watchers in my opinion. But awesome acting from Reese Witherspoon really got me going.

To get back on her feet she decides to walk from Mexico to Canada without any experience walking at all.For hikers this movie is going to be a joke. For me, it's just mildly entertaining in its attempt to depict possible problems that arise from walking.In the end, this movie is not worth seeing if you don't completely adore Reese Whiterspoon and has seen every single movie she has starred in.

215,johanrattus,"Blah blah, why make a movie of this?",3,16 January 2015,"Strayed is difficult to like so we never bond with or particularly pull for her. A lot of people have hiked the PCT, and a lot of people have experienced tough times, but why do we care that somebody turned her life into a heroin and promiscuity-filled train wreck, then hiked? There was no reason to bond with the main character.And I don't buy the portrayal of the park ranger who tries to leave her in the pouring rain instead of letting her in the door 20 feet away unless she does him favors, then makes another advance with three other hikers around. Really? Men are generally portrayed in this film as puckish clowns or sexual predators. Consider the source - a head case hiker armed with a bunch of condoms and a beast-with-two-backs habit. In reality most people one meets along the PCT have nature in mind. I guess we're seeing it from her perspective.More interesting would have been a documentary on the PCT or another episode of ""Intervention"" with Strayed as the focus. Largely absent was the beauty of the PCT and any reason to bond with any of the characters.Not terrible but no real reason to see it. Could have been titled ""Horny Head Case Ex-Heroin Addict Adulterer With Foul Attitude and Potty Mouth Takes Time to Process Painful Memories That Many People Experience - While Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail"", but I suppose ""Wild"" fits the marquee better.

I was constantly feeling like I was missing something, which may have to do with not reading the book before watching the movie.

I recall having less of a bad taste in my mouth after completing the book than I had after the film, but neither Cheryl's life nor her hike warrants the existence of either. There's no moral lesson to be learned here - you don't get to take an ill-considered 1,000 mile walk/hitchhike and wash away all the injustices you've perpetrated upon those who were unfortunate enough to have loved you - don't get to just decide your forgiven and redeemed because you were amazingly lucky and somehow avoiding dying of thirst or exhaustion in the desert.

Great soundtrack and use of imagery and flashbacks. I don't consider Reese Witherspoon a premier actress with an amazing body of work but she's good enough & gets the job done here.

I am with the many many who give it an extremely low grade. Many people have a lot of challenges in their life. Not all become foul mouthed slutty whack jobs who go off the deep end and decide to hike a trail with virtually no experience. To prove what? To ""find yourself""? To exorcise demons of your past? To prove some point that 'hey I screwed up my life......I'll go on a hike'? Life is a summation of some luck, but mainly choices and decisions you make. This lady made some very poor decisions, and rather than take any ownership seems to blame everyone else. Attempting to be some sort of feminist poster child she instead shows us her life in endless flashbacks that were hard to keep track of, and done in a manner to make the movie almost unwatchable.

My group of friends had mixed reactions, some of us were deeply moved (myself included) some where wondering why we were...I felt the way her story was portrayed in flashbacks was very effective and about the only way to tell this story. It can never be as deep as the emotions in the book and it had to skim over a lot but still, for me and others I was with it was very powerful.On a superficial side note...

You suffer right along with Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) who hikes over 1000 miles alone across the Pacific Crest Trail. The movie interchanges seamlessly between the hike and scenes that play in Cheryl's memory. It is about redemption of a life poorly lived. There is not one minute in this movie without Reese Witherspoon but her acting prowess makes that not a problem at all. She is excellent and infinitely watchable. I've spoken to enough actors to know that certain projects are more pleasurable for the actors to act in than for the audience to experience. This is one such film. It's a star vehicle, award nominating role for Reese Witherspoon but would I desire to watch this movie over and over again? Not a chance. But the movie does do its job by making us ponder the idea of whether we have lived our best lives and if we haven't, what would we need to do to figure out our life's purpose? After ""Wild"", I certainly appreciate the exercise of meditation much much more - a far more practical and safer method of finding oneself. Cheryl Strayed certainly was an incredibly courageous young woman but I wouldn't recommend choosing her path of self-discovery.",Wild

The story was really good, the fact that it is a true story makes it even more impressive. Character development was a bit drawn out with the flashbacks and such, but it kept viewers interested and curious til the ending scene. Reese Witherspoon was fine, in some part she wasn't good as she could be in delivering the emotions ;but overall, she did a great job. Cinematography was good, some nature scene was well-shot, well-lit. Some editing part was a bit off, some part was a bit too long (For example the first 5 mile scene) and the first few flashbacks are too fast for people like me to process them. The choices for music was not too appropriate for some scene (such as the sex parts). Could have been and 8 or 9 if the opening parts were edited better.

The scenery, of course, is beautiful, more so since I am an avid hiker and live in Oregon. This is where the good news ends. The movie is pretty dull and meandering. There's little cohesion to the story. The characters that she encounters are all flat, no exception, which is a major flaw in the narrative. The people who help her, amuse her, educate her, or frighten her are all but shadows. There's a guy that she decides to spend the night with, but it's completely incidental to the story, and we don't care. The true peril and hardship of her journey is not fully elaborated. It seems pretty hard, but exactly how hard is not clear. Constant flashbacks detract from us being absorbed in her journey.

233,hu-zhang,The only way out is through,9,1 February 2015,"This is a vivid story of a young woman who grappled with her damaged self-identity and regained her strength and dignity after hiking 1000s miles alone in the harsh wild nature. Our society brags too much about young women' sex appeal and superficial freedom, but shows little interest to exam their pain and loss during their youthful time. WILD has made a difference, a very good one.To be honest I was not ready to surrender to someone else's self-discovery story when I stepped into the cinema. Since every one would have an individual version, how could Cheryl's be more impressive? However, after viewing this movie, I must say that this is a very soft and touching movie. If I would ask myself: 'is there anything else in the world more delicate than our soul?' I could hardly think of something. That's why it touches me when watching a lost and vulnerable young soul yearning for guidance and strength before it perishes. Perhaps we have all been there, feeling helpless and despaired. So it also pleases me to see Cheryl winning her true self back. The flashbacks in the movie were well constructed, which showed us illustrations of Cheryl's alcoholic and violent father, her nurturing but a little helpless mother, her seductive and wrongly-expressed sexuality,her addiction to drugs and abandons, and her crippled ability to sustain marriage and other aspects of life... With an agreeable appearance but a devastating emptiness in heart, Cheryl was prone to fall and fall hard, and that's how she had done to herself. Amazingly, during the long marching in PTC, Cheryl started to pay attention to herself, which she rarely did. She dissected her chaos little by little, by grieving on her stupid approach to letting abusive sex to distract her pain, her youthful arrogance to question her mother's unfulfilled life, and her feelings of inadequacy for her mother, her husband and herself... Also, she celebrated herself, for her courage to conquer fears, her incredible persistence and willpower, and her achievement of unveiling a new and intact self-image... In the movie, the overbearing baggage she was carrying on the back and in the mind had been gradually transmuted, and finally gifted to her as essential supplies that would nurture her. The soundtrack was also excellently embedded into the movie. Actually it was those musicals that had brought up most of my tears. 'El Condor Pasa' was a perfect choice to express deep longing for emotional freedom. 'Let 'em in' created a cheerful air to welcome positive influxes. The rhythm of 'Walk unafraid' was commensurate with the energy of the movie. 'I can never go home again' fitted the plot very well. 'Turn away' gently announced the determination and victory Cheryl earned at the end. This movie well depicted the long marching of a soul, being bruised and wounded at the beginning of the march and being healed at the end of the march. It reminds us that in the mire of darkness, the only way out is through, doesn't it? This movie inspired and touched me so much, I am not even keen to see some artificial make-ups to reveal the wounds or sunburns on Reese's face, not at all.",Wild

Breathtaking & raw Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job showing the guts & warmth & spirit it takes sometimes to move forward & ""put yourself in the way of beauty"". Watching her make her way down the path while confronting her own demons & maybe deciding what she thought was the boogie man was really a guardian angel I was blown away. The love & courage one must have to feel their way down that path & the humor & light that was given to that journey did my heart good. Watching Cheryl (Reese Witherspoon) handle the slide show of dark, cold, warm & fuzzy moments she had in her head from her past, & the sweaty ruthless & forgiving, glorious, terrifying aching & wondrous path she had to confront in her present it truly made me feel happy to be.

235,alan_hart,Wild Child,8,25 September 2015,"It has just occurred to me that the title refers not only to the protagonist's journey through the wild, but also to her wild antics prior to setting out on her journey. Go me! Anyway, ""Wild"" has to be one of my favourite movies of the last couple of years. Firstly, Reece Witherspoon is an absolute revelation. She totally nails the part of a lost soul embarking upon an epic journey in order to rediscover her spiritual mojo. Witherspoon is one of those actresses that seems to have been around for a long old time without ever really catching the imagination, but here she gives wonderfully gutsy performance showing just the right balance between defiance and vulnerability. And she's hot, too. To be fair, she probably isn't what you might call a dead ringer for the real Cheryl Strayed, but I can live with that. Secondly, the cinematography - those North American landscapes - wow! If watching this movie doesn't make you want to get off your backside and go hike the PCT, I'd seriously check for a pulse. Okay, so most of us will never do it (me, included) but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't done some internet research in the PCT since watching ""Wild"". Now, I'll admit that ""Wild"" doesn't have much of what you might call a plot. It is the story of one woman's journey of self-discovery, and the various characters she meets along her way are all pretty much incidental. Hence I accept that it won't be everyone's cup of tea - certainly if you prefer a more pacey, plot-driven type of movie then ""Wild"" may not be for you. But if you enjoy a wonderful (and funny) central performance and sumptuous landscapes, you won't find many better. Witherspoon fully deserved her Oscar nomination, in my opinion, and would have been a worthy winner. Superb.",Wild
236,truthreview,Trying so hard,1,29 February 2016,"This movie is motherlovin atrocious. Judging by the struggle she was having in the hotel with the backpack, she wouldn't have made it 2 steps after finally getting it on! I couldn't take the movie serious after that. The voice overs and flashbacks are annoying and done in a very cheesy manner. Acting is bad! Nowhere near Oscar! The director was trying so hard to capture a feeling of ""into the wild"" crossed with Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"" but failed miserably. I've never directed a movie before but given even 1/4th the budget I'm positive I could have done a much better job. Everyone was telling me how stupid thus movie is but I was bored and trusted the reviews here instead. I should've listened to real people. Not the neo vegetarian malnourished feminists that would enjoy this. This should've been a straight to Lifetime movie.",Wild
237,silveraaadamsen,A Journey to Wholeness,10,3 January 2017,"The film has many useful attributes, the most obvious of which is that shows how to heal after hitting a emotional bottom on one's own. Indeed, the idea of working through the trauma on one's own is key to the film.This core message is one that makes intuitive sense. However, the logic of this message is most often ignored in the topic that the film deals with most directly: opiate abuse and a related emotional bottoming out.Wild gives a real-world example on how to turn a physical journey into a journey oneself, again after abuse of opiate drugs and what looks like a ""bottom."" However, rather than go to an AA or 12 Step meeting and chant over and over again that she is powerless over her drug of choice, and even her own life, the heroine takes on an amazing mental and physical challenge and proves that she is anything but ""powerless."" I'm sure the intentions of the author of the book that inspired the film, or even the makers of the film were not thinking of drug treatment or the increasing controversy surrounding AA and 12 Step, nonetheless the film provides interesting commentary on what many think is commonplace knowledge on drug treatment.AA and 12 Step attempt to cultivate feelings of personal powerless in members and insist that this helps to foster a healthier individual and is recovery. Yet, in all other contexts concerned with healing empowerment is a positive. The only groups that consistently work to undermine an individuals sense of competence are religious cults, which should suggest that AA and 12 Step is not something that actually is going to be healing for most people.This is not to say that everyone needs to hike 1100 miles, but it does point that the human beings tend to be happiest and healthiest when they feel empowered and able to meet challenges on their own.",Wild

Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman's story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it ""exciting."" Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or ""training."" Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you've ever been in the area. On foot.

The time alone to search her soul the outbursts of emotion, I felt was a cleansing process for the body, mind, and soul. I thought it was a story worth telling especially these days with so many negative influences in our world. We should be so lucky to experience such a journey.

When watching the movie, I was constantly thinking: is this really the point where everyone gets in a certain moment in their lives? Are we all going to loose our beloved ones and have to cope with this situation? And as you realise that the answer is probably yes, it makes you wonder, whether a hiking tour is the best choice. The big question is: How do you set new goals in your life if you have reached the end? It must not be hiking the PCT, but I think that the film showed nicely how the main character developed through reaching this goal, she became the person she always wanted to be. What regards the film: I think it says it all that the real Cheryl gave a copy of the book to Reese, because she thought Reese is the only one who could portray her. Reese gives a stunning performance, and the film is most like a documentary. However I cannot ignore the point that it is like ""127 Hours"", we see the moments from Cheryl's live fading in during the PCT tour, so in terms of directing and cinematography it was not an extraordinary piece for me.",Wild

I realize it is based on a true story, but there are surely better stories out there? I am shocked Reese has been nominate for an Oscar when you consider that Julianne Moore is in a much more important film called ""Still Alice"" and her acting is AMAZING. Whereas Reese does nothing special in ""Wild"" to warrant a nomination. Even walking through the desert in the heat is not convincing (by the way, where was the sun protection e.g. sunglasses, hat?) I think many of us will be annoyed she wins. Unfortunately we all know how Oscar campaigns work, and Reese owns the film company that produced ""Wild"" and she is a Hollywood darling as such.

It was a film of mostly fiction, or at least exaggerated facts in part. This woman didn't have a background anywhere near as bad as she made out she had, nowhere near.As soon as this woman mentions wanting to write for publisher, I knew I had been conned into watching a film about a woman's attempt to get herself noticed and to maybe secure a nice little job.This wasn't a film about a woman walking with her demons; it was just a woman walking, like a gap year or a bit of time out to take on a bit of an adventure, with the result being a job or a book deal.She was no different than all the thousands that walk that route every year. Other than filling her wanting to fill as many pages of a book as she can with a load of rubbish mostly, oh, and an imaginary creature too!

248,JessL03,Wild Is a Beautiful Film,8,25 February 2020,"Take a deep breath. Put one foot in front of the other. Repeat until desired result is achieved. Wild is one woman's journey hiking the PCT, leading her into the depths of her past wounds and darkness, ultimately out of the other end to a brighter sky and lighter heart.This movie is based on Cheryl Strayed's book that she wrote about hiking the PCT and losing her mother. Reese's performance was absolute excellence, and it is completely apparent how important this project was to her. She is lost in Cheryl. As for Laura Dern, I honestly think this woman is incapable of turning in a bad performance. Even with the two being only years apart in age, the dynamic of mother and daughter is so clear and perfect.Cheryl Strayed is completely lost after the death of her mother. Her mother was the love of her life, her best friend. She spirals out of control into a drug-fueled self-destruction. The destruction and ruins of all personal relationships, including a marriage, are left in her wake. She has alienated herself completely and is far from the woman her mother hoped she would be. Cheryl decides that hiking the PCT will offer her salvation and clarity. It will put her on the path to being the woman she needs to be. She is a novice hiker at best, and what follows is a harrowing journey of wits, perseverance, and inner strength. The movie is told non-linearly, flashing back to memories of Cheryl's past, sometimes her very recent past. The film is able to keep up a good pace and flesh out Cheryl's character and the relationship between her and her mother with this technique. As Cheryl hikes, she is hot, exhausted, and often on the brink of dehydration. Naturally, her thoughts would drift to memories of her childhood, her mother, and of course to some of the worst moments of her life. The flashbacks serve as a look into her mind at the time which is obvious when she is often singing lines to songs that were playing on the radio at the time or mumbling things said in conversations.This is not a happy-go-lucky film. This is a depiction of a very broken person in pain who is struggling with self-destructive behavior. We are not supposed to be immediately in love with this character. She earns our respect on her trek. The PCT is what she needed to help her transform--to help clear her head and work through the awful grief she is enduring. Ultimately, Cheryl is able to find the woman that her mother wanted her to be on the PCT. She is able to pick up the pieces of her life and find love again later in life while still being able to love her mother and keep her with her without feeling unbearable pain any time she thinks of her.Visually, I thought this movie was beautiful. It was made with a lot of natural light, and it shows. Jean-Marc Vallee is an excellent director, and I appreciate his style. He works well with Reese--obviously, with the further proof of Big Little Lies.My heart ached for Cheryl during this film. Her journey left me heartbroken but also inspired. It's quite amazing what the human spirit is capable of. We can push ourselves to do fantastic things, and Cheryl is a great example of this. Watch this film! Keep your heart and mind open.",Wild

250,Venusvee,"If You Read The Book You Will Be Excited. If You Didn't, It May Seem Dull, Although Some Say Otherwise",7,28 September 2014,"I write this review because the first two reviews are done by Film snobs that never read the book. The movie takes place in 1995 and the film style shows that. It seems raw and almost amateur, but in fact its true to the film style of this time. My only criticism is that the movie relies heavily on the astuteness of the audience as it moves fast and touches lightly on numerous important details. I imagine that is why the other reviewers are stuck on the sexual flash backs and the fox. This is a true story that was turned into a novel 17 years later (Yes, it is true REI did in fact replace the boots Cheryl Strayed bought there for free. And Cheryl Strayed is eternally grateful for this fact). Less than two years later, Nick Hornby (novelist turned screen writer) turned this book into a screenplay and he did a good job. It is exciting to see a true story told so accurately. Seriously. There is so much truth translated so well into a moving picture. It is an exciting puzzle piece to watch. There are complaints of the flashbacks. But there are flashbacks for a reason. When a person walks 1,100 miles, they think. And that is what this movie does... shows you her inner thoughts, memories, plans, and her goal... to become the woman her mother raised her to be. The movie shows you the woman and girl she once was, and pulls you next to her through the middle part, before she accomplishes her goalA note, I would think that less 'from behind' style sex flashbacks would be better because she was not being raped. She was horny, and sad, and horny, and wanted to feel good and forget terrible experiences like so many men and women out there. By using doggie style sex in so many flashbacks too many audiences will attribute that to an unneeded message in this movie. But to the main point... will you enjoy this film? Like many tales of personal triumph, you have to be in the mood and mind. Are you lost? Do you hike? Are you a Witherspoon fan? Did you read the book? Do you aspire to any of these things that I have listed? If yes, you will love this movie. If you answered no to all these questions, skip this movie.",Wild

While I don't think I would be taking up any 3 month hikes anytime soon, it really did make me wish that I had an adventure where I could face a few skeletons in my own closet, just as she did.

255,Jarek163,"I never write reviews, but.....",9,20 January 2015,"A fantastic movie that didn't bore me for a single minute of its runtime.Many people here are bashing it because the protagonist was basically an antagonist and that's somehow affected their view on the film as a film, so they only rate the story part of it as a moral guideline.Yes, to me she is an antagonist. Thirty minutes in, I hated Cheryl. That feeling of hatred was progressively increasing with every minute of her screen time. And it did not stop in a final salvation, she just kept on being ""wild"". We get more than a deeper glimpse into her soul, and how she was a nice girl until her mother passed away, which turned her around completely. I'm not saying that something like that is easy, I understand that's a milestone and it's one of the hardest things in life, but she clearly chose the way, because she wanted. She was liberated from her conservative self, as she proclaims at the very end.The movie was beautifully shot, the camera really captured the mood of trekking and the nature shots were just marvelous.The thing that stands out is the editing. Both audio and video editing in this film were better than most of the films that came out in 2014, and dare I say, even belong in the top 5 of that year. No Academy Award for the two when something like American Sniper, which was far away from having stand out editing, received a nomination for both of these categories, is simply despicable.Another thing that is exceptional in the film goes together with the previous point: it is very personal and emotional. It reminded me of Perks of Being a Wallflower in this sense, as it utilized flashbacks in the same way - to create tension, and ultimately climax in emotional breakdown. Witherspoon's performance was excellent, I'd place her in the top 3 of this year's AA nominees, she has a solid shot on actually getting the award, and I would be okay with that.",Wild
256,myfbk_account,"Good story, nice acting, great scenery, not so strong editing and plot development. My outdoor friends and I loved it.",8,2 April 2015,"I saw Wild last night. I typically read reviews after watching movies but on this occasion read a number of IMDb reviews before watching the movie—one was positive and three very negative. Two friends had recommended the movie and I approached Wild with these thoughts in mind.I loved Wild. The scenes were beautiful—especially the desert, the snow, and Crater Lake in Oregon. The Bridge of the Gods overlooked a beautiful stretch of the Columbia River (which I have visited only at night). This will be important to nature lovers—for me just the scenes made the movie worth watching.Reese has been criticized for not being realistic as a drug / sex addict and for lacking range. I found her to be one perfect type. In her background were physically abusive male grown ups but her mother was very nurturing and loving and encouraging of Reese's character, Cheryl's, development. Going into her period of abuse, then, she was not a typical 'user'. Not that there is a type but while she was losing her center she did not lose it altogether. I imagine that there might have been more evident struggle, suffering and perhaps hysteria ('acting') but not necessarily; some people suffer quietly. Reese did this well. The character would have scored high in introversion.I liked the story-line—one woman finding redemption in the wild. In some movies flashbacks are part of the story, making for non-linearity. In this movie I saw the scenes from the past not as stylistic flashbacks but as Cheryl's thought bubbles as she hiked; the editing could have been less choppy but the idea worked well for me. When I'm out hiking the physicality of it, the wonder at nature, and my own thought bubbles are all large parts of the experience.Which reminds me, I would have liked more nature in the movie; it would have been nice to see more hiking; and it would have been nice to see more attention to Cheryl's physical and skill development as a hiker. Her pack was a huge mess in the beginning (natural for a beginner without much preparation) but it would have been nice to see it get smaller and tidier; it would have been nice to see some real hiking skills. And her emotional growth could have been developed better—it seemed rather sudden at the end—there could have been more continuity, perhaps with growth as well as setbacks. Perhaps, though, given her 'sophistication'—by which I mean her growth as a person before she entered her time of 'difficulty' with drugs and sex—sudden realization might have been natural.Overall I liked the story and the themes a lot; the editing and Cheryl's growth as a person could have been done better. I've given Wild an 8 because I really did enjoy it. I do think the movie could be re-done better. But, as a long time backpacker in wilderness areas of America, Wild appealed to me very much. My story is not Cheryl's but the wild has loomed large in my life and growth.",Wild
257,axanghelescu,self destruction and healing,8,9 February 2015,"This movie is NOT about a flawless character, a role model, or about what society would call the journey of a ""hero"". It's about human behavior, it's about depression, coping with tragedy in the wrong ways, it's about the dark side of life. It's also about forcing yourself to be alone, afraid, in pain, and struggle. It's about letting go of prejudice - which most viewers will cast upon the main character, and understanding that people cope with pain in different ways. Some heal, some never do. It is so often a traumatic experience that fuels one to do the unthinkable, and this movie emphasizes that. The PCT is not only 1000 miles, but it is 1000 miles in solitude, fear, discomfort, and extreme conditions. It's the realizations that you make alone, put in extreme situations, that define who you are, and not your past. It's about not trying to change and control your destiny, but just letting it be and take its course. It seems that every bad review is bashing the morality of the character, that it is not a real drama if the character is not perfect, as if only the perfect people deserve to be heroes.

259,decadent-page,Cheryl Strayed hikes the Pacific Crest Trail to escape death and self-destructive behavior.,10,25 December 2014,"Through flashbacks and less-than-one-second clips of film, we learn that Cheryl Strayed is recently divorced and grieving the death of her mother, a woman who was the ""love of Strayed's life."" Between the death and the divorce, Strayed has intercourse with anyone who asks, including her restaurant customers (sometimes more than one at a time) and bar patrons, but she no longer is intimate with her husband. She's smoking and shooting heroine to be ""happy.""The sexual aspect of this film very carefully delivers a message that too often gets confused in America: just because woman did something promiscuous in her past does not mean she's ""asking for it"" in the present. While on the PCT, Strayed only has one sexual partner, and the rest of the time she fears for her physical safety. Men constantly imply she's ""that kind of girl"" and try to get her alone. They inch toward the notion that if only she'd put out, she'd get something in return: food, a ride, shelter, water. I mean, come in; what kind of woman walks 1,000 miles alone (goes the thinking). The way Strayed seems practically chased down the PCT as she tries to escape would-be rapists made me feel like I was running too, from a fear that women must always assume could turn into a reality. At one point, Strayed sees two hunters. After they spend too much time with their hands on their low-slung belts and talk about her like she's not there, Strayed claims she's leaving. Around the bend, she sets up camp and changes into her pajamas only to realize one of the hunters has followed watched her change. He says he likes the way her hips and legs and ""tight ass"" look in her pants. Strayed asks that he not say that, but he retorts that women don't know how to take a compliment. Sound familiar? We've been discussing what constitutes sexual harassment in America so much lately, and Wild addresses it over and over and over again. It was a strong aspect of the film--my favorite, in fact. I was so proud when one man tells Strayed ""you sound like a feminist"" like it's an insult, and she replies, ""I am.""While much of the movie is walking and Strayed talking to herself, the flashbacks come in at key moments and overlap with the present, suggesting Strayed can't tell the difference. At one point, she looks in the window of a cabin only to see an x-ray of her mother's spine, which is covered in tumors. Other times, songs send Strayed back. For instance, a song on the radio reminds Strayed of her mother singing in the kitchen. Annoyed, Strayed tells her mom (played by Laura Dern) to stop singing because there is no reason to be happy: they are both full-time waitresses, college students, and they will have loan debt for the rest of their lives. Strayed's mother reminds her daughter to find the best version of herself and cling to it. Strayed remains fiercely annoyed and disappointed. At one point, she even feels the need to tell her mom that she is a more sophisticated woman than her mother was at the same age. The scenes between Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern were beautiful. Dern has the right kind of rugged look mixed with a soft side that suggests she's been through a lot, but is a delicate and beautiful person nonetheless. Dern almost comes off as an ""everywoman's mother,"" making it not so hard to believe she could be in your kitchen singing and taking to you.The other characters in the cast had the same harsh look to them, but not as much softness. This is a good thing. Strayed's friend Aimee has thick, unplucked eyebrows, messy hair, and lacks make-up. She looks like the most regular woman in the nation. Strayed looks much worse: her face is bruised from walking into branches, there are massive bruises/rashes/bloody spots everywhere her pack contacts her body, her feet are covered in blisters and bleeding, and she seems to have huge half-dried scabs on any part of her that's pointy (knuckles, knees, elbows, etc.). The beauty in this is that the movie doesn't take the story of a woman on the edge of life and death and make her Hollywood glamorous. As much as I love Katniss Everdeen, ever notice she always has at least some mascara and lip gloss? Such touches distract from a film in which a woman is fighting for her life. The only part I couldn't get behind was the fox. After a while, it's clearly a metaphor for Strayed's mother watching her on the PCT, but the creature was a fairly pitiful computer generated image. Also, Reese Witherspoon seemed pretty insistent on biting down spoons whenever she ate, which in a Dolby Digital surround-sound theater is pretty loud and awful. Clunk, clink, chomp, swallow. Lots of it. Finally, during the credits actual photos of author Cheryl Strayed on the PCT were displayed, but they didn't appear right away, so most of the theatergoers had left. I stayed because I assumed it would be a huge mistake if the filmmaker didn't take the opportunity to compare Witherspoon and the author, and I was justified.Overall, Wild doesn't need to be ""touched up."" It doesn't need unnecessary drama, explosions, fight scenes, or other fanfare that has become standard in American film to keep our preoccupied brains at attention. In fact, much of the film relies on internal monologue, brief dialogue, or silence—even if Strayed's heart is screaming. Instead, the movie says something about Americans today: the way they act and react to a world that can close down its jaws and bite hard.",Wild
260,adrian-littwold,A powerful movie but unfortunately so boring,5,16 November 2014,"I have to start this review saying that it is a good movie. It actually is. The movie is about a woman (Reese Witherspoon) deciding to find herself by walking 1.100 miles in the wilderness. Reese Witherspoon's acting in this movie is truly first class. Without a good actress in a movie like this it would be just such a disaster. So that's a huge plus for this movie. A movie like this is really difficult to make enjoyable. In this generation it feels like we almost always need some action, mind- blowing twists or some climax. This movie had none of these and I am fine with that. One of my favourite director, Richard Linklater, is an expert on doing movies that using only dialogues he makes masterpieces in my opinion. The problem is, this was no Richard Linklater movie.The movie is boring to watch and there is the problem. It's really slow and I believe I have never felt two hours taking so long in my life. I feel like something is missing in this movie, maybe some more dialogues or some climax because it was simply slow and boring after a while - but it was still a good movie overall. I believe that a movie without any sort of action, climax, mind- blowing twists or good script needs to be splendid for it to be enjoyable. This wasn't really.6/10",Wild

It's a heartfelt movie and just overdone with f all over the place. It's not a film for everyone. My girlfriend of almost 9 years did not find it heartfelt or amusing. I don't mind a little bit when necessary. This was a grab for attention. NOT necessary. It was good to see a female lead carrying the film so well. Laura Dern was amazing also. The director and producers should wake up. We could have taken much from the film if it had not been covered over with lowly executed sexual activity and with the ""F"" word being the star of the show rather than the actresses. It was a grab for attention. It is a shame. This movie could have been a good one. I was generous in giving it a 7.",Wild
262,saviornt,"Good movie, but not great",7,19 December 2014,"Coming from an outdoor enthusiast, this was a pretty good movie. There were more than a few times when I laughed, since I was in her shoes at one point or another. The movie does highlight some of the thought processes that one has when out in the wild (no pun intended) and alone.I didn't think it was a ""great"" movie, but definitely worth a watch if you're an outdoor enthusiast. I had hoped that the movie would have more outdoor and hiking scenes than it did, but I suppose, that is just me.Reese Witherspoon did portray the character well, however, in my experience, there is more despair and desperation moments that the movie did not show. The only reason why these sort of trips have such a high drop out rate is due to the mental aspects, not the physical aspects. However, you come out the better person when you finally complete the trip.",Wild
263,xmarinka-34186,"honest, deep, dramatic and beautiful",9,28 March 2015,"I loved this movie. My favorite part about this movie is the idea - being true to ones feelings, being destroyed by pain to the point of loosing oneself and having the strength to finding it again; having the strength and incredible will to let go and move on. I find it deep and insightful.I also like the presentation of this idea - in a simple, very honest way. That's why I think, the symbolism they used fits in so well, even though it's a bit obvious - the heavy bag she carries at the beginning of the journey, bleeding feet, getting new shoes that fit, throwing up (as letting all the bad things out) and coming to the gods bridge. All of these are classic, obvious symbols, which are in tune with the simpleness of the presentation of the idea. This brings me to another point I like about this movie, how it contrasts this very simple plot and very simple presentation to very complicated 'things' inside the main character. I also have to mention the script, because its loooong time since I have seen/heard such a good script - communicating the drama of one's life without overdoing it. And OK, there are some factual errors in this movie, but they are not so important and Witherspoon did a great job as an actress and a producer. For me it's her best movie so far. So to sum it up - strong drama, in simple, honest presentation, inspiring to return to your good self, no matter what may happen. The way we deal with our feelings, is the way we leave.",Wild
264,biglucy-92528,Good Movie about Struggles on the PCT,7,30 April 2015,"I am surprised by the negative reviews of Wild on this website. Is is ""Citizen Kane"" - no - but it is an enjoyable, entertaining and beautifully filmed movie. Certainly better than ""Birdman"" (hated it) or ""Boyhood"" (watching grass grow would have been more entertaining). I listened to part of this book on tape and could't get excited about it - didn't even finish. The movie was better - how often does that happen?Anyway - Wild is based on a true story about Cheryl Strayed, a woman with a chaotic childhood who has tragically lost her mother and sinks into a life of dissolution and self- destruction. When at her lowest she decides to get away from the mess her life has become and hike the Pacific Coast Trail alone. She is very unprepared for such a difficult and demanding trip, as is soon apparent. So, the movie is about her journey: both physically - how she becomes trail-wise and hardened: and spiritually -how she reaches deep into herself to find the mental stamina to continue and how in the course of the hike she forgives herself and starts to heal. As a woman, I was very interested to see how a single woman copes under these circumstances and found myself wondering - could I do this? Is this an outdoor chick-flick? I don't know - it would be interesting to learn the gender of the yeahs and nays. I did not find this movie boring at all, as did some of the negative reviews and I think I'm a fairly critical movie-goer.The movie was filmed in a pretty straightforward manner, with flashbacks covering Strayed's life before the hike that were easy to understand. Witherspoon did a good job, as did the other actors. The scenery was gorgeous. The message of the movie was inspiring. What's not to like?",Wild
265,trinhphamsf,Inspiring but boring and miscasting,5,25 July 2015,"There is always a risk of adapting a movie from a book, especially when the book is about a solo journey, and the readers can only explore what goes through the main character's mind by reading through the book. But how do you do that on screen? How can you understand the main character if she doesn't say anything? I think this movie falls in to that path. It's inspiring but boring and awkward.First of, I think Reese Witherspoon is a totally miscasting for this movie. I had a hard time accepting her role. The cursing, the nude scenes, the wild behaviors, none of these fit Witherspoon. It's good to see Reese try a different range, but sadly she is not made for it. she doesn't belong to this category. I didn't buy it. Secondly, although the movie is inspiring because it is based on a true story of author Cheryl Strayed and I loved her "" Tiny Beautiful Things"" book, but this book? It is OK. It is inspiring but not very exciting. So I don't see how some people can get through the movie without yawning, I gave the movie a try and to me, it is even more boring than the book.

The never- ending pain from her mother's death, unhealthy addictions and lifestyles, a heartbreak are only some of the odds she puts up a fight against on her road to self discovery. This journey through the wilderness of nature was as much of a learning experience for me as for Cheryl.

I would advise to read the book if you enjoy the movie, but you might find it has a different feel to it, then the movie.

277,caseyyau,The long and winding road,10,23 February 2015,"I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.Like the life of a lot of people, this movie is about the journey we take. Its not about the destination or achieving a particular purpose. It is deeply realistic, and i am glad it doesn't lecture or give a moral lesson on how we should be ,or a happy ending because we don't always get that in life. Life is ugly and it doesn't always end in happiness and things don't always happen for a reason good people do not always get a good ending and normal people can do bad things to themselves and to toh others due to pain brought on by unbearable grief.

279,ccwerntz,Woman journeys to find herself,6,27 December 2014,"Before I saw the film, I read the book. The trip of it seemed interesting to me (I had made a similar trek of my own), the story told more than a hike. Wild had more to do with events leading up to the trip that ensued. The story wasn't sandwiched on both ends of the trek with a bad beginning and a happy ending, but it told about one woman's troubled past and the trip held its own. It was a sorry surprise to find her live in the past throughout the whole trip and only included the trip when it seemed like she was talking too much about her painful past. I sympathize with her foolish past and loss of a mom, but most all people experience a myriad of similarities, so I found it made noise because Cheryl is a great writer and honest. With that being said, the screenplay seemed to be churned through a formula for cinema, which was hard to digest. Since I read the book, I could see what was emphasized or cut, which told me a lot about which parts of the book held weight enough to be included. The film appealed to females and old men whose wife brought them (I was the only young man I saw). The film was quiet and would have fell through the cracks if it didn't wrangle some originality -- which you have to see for yourself. In conclusion, I found the book to be a better journey, but I am not impressed with Cheryl's motivation which trickled to the film. Cheryl titled it Wild, which it seems is her final analysis about what she took from the trip. I don't believe she knows what it is she found so she concluded that we all are wild, that life is wild, that it's all wild. It is. I don't disperse from that truth, but she set the bar quite low.

It was hard to have sympathy with the character who bumbles her way through the trail. Early on in the film when it took a long time for her to put on her backpack was a sign of things to come. Wrong fuel for her burner, had trouble putting up her tent, lost her boots. I thought the next thing that will happen was that she'd pull out her straighteners. She was not inspirational. I don't even think she'd appeal to female viewers as inspirational. The re-appearing red fox (I think) seemed to be plucked out of The Simpsons. Very disappointing given its review score. Better than this are Into The Wild and The Way which had a bit more about them. Some more emotional connection was evident, to me, in these films.

285,razvan-neagoie,"Powerful lesson about acceptance, self forgiveness, keeping your chin up and keep walking",8,6 January 2016,"Hiking a long distance as a way to recover from a recent personal drama might sound like a justified action to undertake. But when the protagonist is a woman, travelling alone, on foot, on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) for more than 1800 kilometres, from Mexican border to the Canadian border, many questions come to your mind.Cheryl Strayed doesn't look as one who can deal with such a challenge. She's physically unprepared, she didn't follow a training, she carries a too large and heavy backpack and she didn't take the proper things with her. She looks naive to set out to such a hard journey. Flashbacks constantly interrupt the sequence of the challenges Cheryl faces into the wild. They are meant to reveal, although not in chronological order, the facts that determined her to make this decision. Losing the person we have loved most may cause a terrible grief. Of course, I have not agreed with the way Cheryl had initially chosen to struggle with the cruel, unfair loss but I can admit that people react in very different, unpredictable ways when they feel lost. Also Cheryl, I think, after realizing the wrong way she had taken, makes this dangerous journey to somehow punish herself. On the other hand, she might feel motivated once more to overcome the past and move on. It is what her mother (wonderful performance of Laura Dern) would ask her to do. She was a very positive person despite the difficulties she encountered during her life. And this is the attitude she passed to her daughter.Jean-Marc Vallee (who also directed the good film 'Dallas Buyers Club') did a very good job. The landscapes are beautiful, the nature is fascinating. The very few people Cheryl meets on the road are so real, with more or less principles, some trying to take advantage of any opportunity. But, by far, the performance of the leading character (Reese Witherspoon) is the best. I was taken aback how the 'legally blonde' succeeded to be so credible, so human while she went through the various states: pain, sufferance, anger, fear or commitment. I had a change of heart in regards with her acting potential. She bravely (literally and figuratively) carries the burdens on her shoulders (by the way, she is quite funny carrying that overloaded backpack). I haven't read the book (probably the emotions transmitted directly by the Cheryl's memoirs are much deeper) but, nevertheless, I think the movie is a powerful lesson about acceptance, self forgiveness, keeping your chin up and keep walking. I definitively recommend watch it.",Wild

Whether it's a sunny day in the mountains or a rainy day in a forest, or a flashback to some time in Cheryl's life, the film looks fantastic.Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful and unglamorous performance. She is subtle and believable without any hint of trying to say ""hey look at me, I'm acting."" She comes off as authentic and passionate about this role.The structure of the film is that as Cheryl is hiking the PCT, she comes across obstacles or scenery that reminds her of certain times in her life. These moments are presented as flashbacks to fill the audience in on Cheryl's motivations and why she is who she is. These flashbacks never feel shoehorned in, rather that they are presented exactly how and when they should be. The film feels long, in the sense that you are really experiencing a lot of Cheryl's life across a grand personal journey. The feeling of length allows for the audience to connect with Cheryl and root for her.The films does a good job of presenting the really emotional moments in a way that allows the audience to feel Cheryl's struggles and relate to her. The film presents these moments without beating the audience over their heads or coming off as hammy.The film presents a rare character- a strong, flawed, female lead. Cheryl Strayed is a flawed character. However, she is presented as a strong woman who is facing up to the way she dealt with her grief and is trying become who she always wanted to be. It was refreshing seeing a strong female that wasn't either the perfect girlfriend or the evil villain. Witherspoon really delivered this character well.The bad: There were a few scenes that feel like they have no real purpose other than to add tension to the fact that a woman is hiking 1000 miles alone.Walking 1000 miles presents many dangers. There was a big snow the year Cheryl actually made the hike. There's a constant danger of dehydration, infection, injury, and so on.

I sure as hell hope not, but she probably will, because Hollywood is stupid. In any case, this movie was awful, and terrible for women. Wild was by far the worst movie I saw this year.In this movie Witherspoon bends from type to portray Cheryl Strayed, a woman dealing with sex and drug addiction and the premature loss of her mother who decides to hike the entirety of the Pacific Crest Trail. I gather Strayed, in real life, is a from-the-earth type. I mean, she has a Bob Marley T-shirt and thinks hiking will solve her problems. She's like the white Oprah, if her advice column is any indication. But Witherspoon, even when acting as Cheryl, is none of these things. This movie proves that Witherspoon couldn't act like a sympathetic character if there was an Uzi to her back. Witherspoon is a sniveling, Flickian, narcissistic bitch, and therefore this so-called story of redemption—Woman Goes on 1,000-Mile Hike to Cleanse Herself of Sins and Find Herself—comes across not as real or raw or uplifting but just another tale of easy blonde triumph.I'm one of three people I know who liked Eat, Pray, Love. But that's because Julia Roberts crushed that role. That movie was uncomfortable as heck but also very happy and fun. Julia put herself through the meat grinder to do justice to Elizabeth Gilbert. It may be the same meat grinder she went through for every other role she's played, but it's fun to watch every time.

293,thisisadamshaffer,Reese Witherspoon shines in an otherwise OK film about self-discovery,8,3 December 2014,"Based on the true story of Cheryl Strayed and her emotional 1100 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail after an emotional catastrophe, Reese Witherspoon brings some of her best work to date.From director Jean-Marc Vallee, who shot to the directors A-list last year with ""Dallas Buyers Club"", he again is able to bring out the best in his central character, while at times leaving the rest of the movie behind. Told through flashbacks and while on her journey, we find she portrays a very flawed (lots of random sex and drugs), yet like likable character. Though, still one that is hard to really get attached to.Like his film last year, he struggles to bring some substance to the screen, but is always able to make his actors stand out. This will likely make him a favorite for many stars to work with in the future. The film otherwise can be considered to slow and melodic for some. Yet, the rawness he brings is also one of the best things I liked about it. The breathtaking cinematography also stand out.Many will compare it to Sean Penn's ""Into the Wild"", one of my favorite films ever. While it's understandable, i'm not sure its warranted. Alexander Supertramp she is not, and thats OK. There are some big differences to say the least, but at their very core, are similar in their central theme.While I can say I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, I'm not sure its memorable.

294,orvillebach,Not Recommended,2,26 December 2014,"A big disappointment, especially when considering the content of the book. Instead of focusing on the high adventure of her journey along the PCT, we are inundated continually with graphic depictions of her one night stands and heroin use. The film could have included her troubled past in an appropriate way, but did not. So if you enjoy nude scenes with druggies, watching losers shooting up and drugged out, and hearing the constant use of the F word, this is the film for you. Based on the book, Cheryl wanted to take this trip to seek a new identity and become the person that her mother wanted her to be. She adored her mother, who was depicted as being a wonderful person. However, even along the hike the film shows her possessing a dozen condoms and having a one night stand. The overuse of flashbacks take us away from the great adventure to graphic sex scenes she had with strangers. The audience reaction was obvious. At the beginning of her PCT trip the audience was jovial and into the adventure, but then the constant flashbacks of her morbid past brought the audience down. Even when we returned to the trail and something humorous would occur to Cheryl, the audience did not respond. The only ""uplifting"" portion of the film occurs in the last scene when she is shown standing on the bridge at the end of the journey reflecting on what a wonderful life she now has. Certainly, the trip depicted in the film did not lead to that final statement.",Wild

However, from the time that it started until it finished I was captivated. I felt Reese Witherspoon did a fantastic job portraying this woman's story and really takes you through her journey with was very emotional and hard to watch at times! Highly recommend this movie and the fact that it was a true story makes it even better. Other reviewers commented that it was too long, but I did not feel that way at all. You see her triumph after all the pain she had both caused and endured. Im sure it must be challenging to do a movie where the focus is primarily on you, from both the actor's and director's standpoint. This is not a typical Reese movie and she did such a great job!!",Wild

It wasn't your typical shooting and fighting movie so maybe wasn't up to some standards but I loved the story and the scenery was amazing. I want to go hike the trail and see it for myself! It involved comedy, drama and yes there was some explicit sex scenes but that is all spelled out in the rating of the movie. Went to see this with my husband and was afraid it might not be fast paced enough for him but he actually loved it also. I really don't know what else to say about it other than you should go see it for yourself and decide. I don't think you will be disappointed in the movie.",Wild

Somehow she doesn't die, mostly because she keeps getting packages delivered to her along the trail, somehow, and strangers keep giving her stuff even though the dudes that help her are all portrayed as scary creepers. In the end she justifies the heroin and sex with strangers while married as character building, and pats herself on the back. I like Reese Witherspoon, and she didn't do a terrible job in this movie, but I found the character she portrayed to lack substance, and I never found myself rooting for her, in fact, I was mostly talking crap to the screen the whole time it was on.

Her attitude towards life is negative and selfish. From the first scene when she carelessly knocks her boot off the edge of the cliff and throws the other one - I shook my head. She goes through that whole walk without finding any meaning, just feeling sorry for herself and not thinking carefully about what she is doing. Because she has no idea about hiking or camping, she ends up asking men for help and then thinking that they all want to sleep with her, which they don't, but that's her bad attitude for you.I'd have to say my favourite part of the film was when the older man empties her pack for her.

Being there done that, this movie brings out a side of human nature, a certain walk of life that is not in everyone's map. It is true!very true! how nature could heal you. Do a 'wild' hike and you will never be the same person again. Nature has this magical,otherworldly power, that heals and mends like no other. I know because I have felt it!

302,amanda-236-750008,Lovely film about exploring and finding oneself,8,11 February 2015,"Reese Witherspoon opens up to us in this film as a well and truly developed dramatic actress which to me was something of a discovery when you think about her usual romantic or comic parts in the past.I think the film is poorly promoted and as a result may end up undervalued and under-appreciated by the judges and the audience.When I first read about it on IMDb – ""A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent catastrophe"" – I was reluctant to watch it. It sounded like one of those boring semi-documentaries about someone's trip across the USA Nevertheless, determined to form my own opinion of yet another new film which did get nominated for Oscar, I started watching it and I am so glad that I did. Because it is so much more than just a story of 'one woman's hike'. It is a nostalgic and philosophical journey through the entire life of Cheryl (Witherspoon) written in the best traditions of storytelling – you may easily compare it to Tolkien's Hobbit or Homer's Oddisey.Having lost her mother and left her husband, having been utterly disillusioned with everything in her life and having been indeed lost in more than one way (the movie is based on a true story book ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"") and having found no cure in the outside world, Cheryl searches deeper and deeper inside herself, she undertakes a hiking journey – with a bag almost larger than herself, with no training or experience which is challenging beyond her expectations and may kill her – or allow her to finally find herself and peace in her life She is determined at any cost to get to the end of it. She starves, gets injured, bleeds, meets strange people and animals, travels through prairie and mountains, through snowy plains and her memories Her physical journey is impossible to detach from her emotional and spiritual ones – she has to succeed in all of them to come out on the top.Facing real, wild nature makes her realise how really strong she is and how much is there to life. Some professional hikers she meets along her way – give up and go back to their city homes complaining that the weather conditions aren't favourable for their hiking. But not Cheryl – she gets to her destination – in every possible sense. She even gets eventually comfortable in the rough settings of the wilderness making her journey even more intimate – for she is travelling towards herself And we, the audience, soon realise that we are travelling with her but towards our inner selves. We feel for her, we worry about her, we even get scared at times with her – whilst we reflect on our lives and our need for a similar harmony as the one she is searching for.You may perceive it differently but to me it's a modern feminist philosophical epic well worth watching, not just a movie about one woman's hike Apart from Reese Witherspoon whose dramatic performance is stunning and touching to the core, this film should be noted for the excellent supporting roles played by Laura Dern and Gaby Hoffmann. As well as a fabulous soundtrack! My favourite moment in the film – a curious fox following Cheryl – could he be an Indian spirit?.. Or the spirit of her late mother – who occupies her thoughts and memories and possibly guiding her on that spiritual journey",Wild

306,desiree-goodwin,Bland portrayal of a great book,5,22 February 2015,"I rushed to finish reading Cheryl Strayed's memoir Wild, so that I could watch the movie with the book fully digested. While I think Reese Witherspoon is a fine actress, and I admire much of her work, didn't think this role was right for her. The story required an actress who was capable of subtle and realistic portrayal of epic emotions. I didn't see any realistic crying scenes, reactions to walking in adverse condition, or any other emotion in close up facial expressions. The movie depended more on makeup to show how hard her journey was. Reese Witherspoon didn't have the buff muscle tone and deep tan honed by weeks roughing it in the wild that Cheryl Strayed described. Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern appear to be too close in age to be mother and daughter. Cheryl Strayed was in her mid twenties when she embarked on this journey. I think this role would have been better played by an actress like Scarlett Johansson, who typically plays the sexy bad ass roles, and looks more like Cheryl Strayed than Reese Witherspoon does. The story doesn't make Cheryl Strayed that likable or believable, it is hard to get absorbed or carried away in the movie version. In the book you get the sense of someone who is utterly lost, and gets addicted to the pain of the struggle (not as vividly portrayed in the movie), and caught up in the beauty of the wild. Her redemption is knowing that she can endure. She wants to absorb some of her mother's love and kindness into herself. That relationship is not developed enough in the movie. In the first 5 minutes of watching Jane Eyre on Netflix, I saw Mia Wasikowska trudging along the moors, her long dress and cloak weighed down by a miserable rain storm with tears streaming down her face. This actress too would have more convincingly portrayed Cheryl Strayed's struggle and triumph on the PCT trail.",Wild
307,rallen-01716,Reese? Umm..What were you thinking?,1,5 April 2015,"Reese Witherspoon is a fine actress. Even after this disaster, she is still excellent at her craft. The story itself is so weak however, that Witherspoon cannot carry it alone. I went into the movie anticipating an against all odds struggle pitting the harsh realities of nature vs. a broken woman trying to find her own reality. After 20 minutes, I realized that I was getting taken for five bucks. There are many parts in the movie that seem hardly like they happened in real life to the real Cheryl. Scenes appear to be invented and just thrown in because they needed filler in between boring hiking scenes and annoying flashbacks. The only positive thing that a person could take from this film is that you will now NOT BE AFRAID whatsoever of hiking 1200 miles on the Pacific Trail!",Wild

The only good thing I can say about it is that we bonded watching it because we were all laughing and cursing at how awful the movie was. The flashbacks were horribly done - cutting in and out until you're nauseous with no flow and no benefit to the film itself.Biggest problem I think everyone would agree on: The description of this film needs to be changed. If the description actually described the film, I would never have wasted my time watching it and thus never realized how brutal it is and never have commented on it. It says it's a movie about the PCT. It's not. We see maybe 5 minutes of the trail in it. Change the description to say it's about a druggie sex maniac psycho woman who goes for a hike and has never hiked before. that's about the extent of the content and outcome of the movie. don't even mention the PCT; it's irrelevant to the movie.I am an avid hiker, and saw this movie to get an idea of the trail, the challenges of the trail, and how the drop offs work, etc. To have to withstand the poorly acted crybaby ""I've never hiked before and didn't plan anything or think anything through"" idiocy, weirdo makeup (clearly those people have also never hiked before - bleeding knuckles like she was in a fist fight after she set up the tent on day 1 after 5 seconds on the trail??), combined with the crappy scenery and worst cut-in/cut-out so-called flashbacks was too much.

311,bmcphee-01164,A brilliant discarding of past life and Hollywood clichés.,9,21 April 2015,"A low key but engrossing, compelling, real life telling of a real life story. If you want smooth hand held glitz and tidy details then don't bother with this, likewise if you cant get past seeing Reese with more makeup. Full of idiosyncrasies and nonlinear details that could only come from sticking faithfully to a real life narrative from a real person. Reese was a revelation to me. Her choices to appear somewhat foolishly naive and disconnected at times are completely spot on for the character. If you live a real life rather than a film one, you will be completely drawn in by the end.Spoiler: The only criticism I've read below that has any legitimacy is that it would have been more accurate and transitional to show her dirtier at times and with a more progressive sunburn and tan. My own experience with low budget films is that would have added 50% to the production schedule and costs, as virtually every film is shot out of order and continuity becomes a nightmare in a narrative like this. Unfortunately that kind of money is just not available to tell this kind of story, but it should be.",Wild
312,heel86,"made me think, which works for me",9,2 May 2015,"This was a thought-provoking and complex film that captures part of the human condition. How do we get back on our feet when life knocks us down? How much do our efforts to cope with tragedy and loss set us back or move us forward? We can be our own worst enemy AND our own heroic redeemer. While this movie documents one woman's (Cheryl Strayed) particular answers to those questions, I found it relatable and moving, which puts mine at odds with many reviews here.Most reviewers scold the main character for casual sex, drug use, and such, but I suspect that men doing the same or similar are probably their ""heroes."" Or if these faithful reviewers don't idolize men for poor behavior, I suspect they wouldn't scold them as fervently as they do Cheryl Strayed (and by extension other women). Even so, I didn't feel this movie was particularly ""feminist."" I'm unsure what such a movie looks like, since even self-avowed feminists would likely bicker infinitely with one another about this film's treatment of sexuality, gender, relationships, and such.Instead, this movie is about a woman's journey, her self-destruction the point of departure. It's long, meandering, reflective, and doesn't provide easy or tidy answers. Many reviews on here amount to this: ""your life sucks so take a LONG, sulking walk,"" concluding the film is a catastrophic bore. But the movie offers much more, particularly if you're inclined to think beyond clichéd surfaces.On her reflective journey the main character literally and figuratively walks many a fine line, but centrally, between redemption and repeating her prior self-destruction. Anyone surprised by or dismissive of a person's recurring struggles with harmful self-medication (addiction, empty casual sex, or whatever else) is more naïve than anything. Such battles are much more than being a ""junkie,"" ""sexually loose,"" and similar characterizations strewn across other reviews here. I don't suppose the reviewers give such matters much thought – they simply judge, label, and name-call what they don't understand or flatly dislike. The film, on the other hand, doesn't judge or label the central characters' choices. And I believe the ending leaves a more open and potentially complex picture than what is suggested by many. I refer here mainly to the voice-over just prior to the credits – while it's ""hopeful"" in tone, it doesn't promise the character's life after the long hike turned out perfect and tidy.This is but one example of how the film demands that the viewer think – I didn't walk away feeling as though it moralized or dragged me toward this or that emotional reaction. If you don't like to be bothered to think, or if you need tidy morality fables leading you to feel a certain way (good or bad), this movie isn't for you.I don't mean to suggest the movie is flawless. I agree with commentary here about the hike and flashbacks to ""backstory."" I doubt the filmmakers randomly interlaced them, but if their interplay was somehow metaphoric, strategic to pace, story development, or whatnot, I didn't catch it. I also believe Reese Witherspoon provides an unsteady portrayal. Some lines she delivers with surgical precision, other lines flatly or unconvincingly. Even so, she succeeds in relaying despair, callousness, cruelty, terror, and various other emotional realms. For all her character's rough edges, courage, and desire to heal, Witherspoon's portrayal also captures her remarkable vulnerability and solitude in unforgiving natural and emotional environments.",Wild
313,tombarreras-94269,A story of redemption without much redemption,3,2 August 2015,"A story of redemption heavy on pain and short on redemption. Reese Witherspoon produces and stars in this story of a woman whose breathtakingly self-destructive behavior--drugs, adultery, degrading sexual encounters, abortion--has brought about a crisis that even she can no longer ignore. Desperate to break the pattern of her life, she decides to set out on a 1000 mile hike of the Pacific Crest trail, despite having little or no experience with backpacking. From her vivid memories of her past misbehavior, we see that she is slowly coming to accept responsibility for her past mistakes, and thereby moving beyond them. But the viewer gets very little payoff for this long slog through her lurid past. While she manages to drag herself back to a state of normalcy, she makes no great spiritual revelations during her journey. Her hike ends underwhelmingly at the Bridge of the Gods on the Oregon-Washington border. She and the movie seem to understand that there should be some greater significance to that, but they don't know what it might be. And contrary to other reviews, the scenery in the movie isn't ""gorgeous,"" but for the Pacific Crest trail is quite ordinary. It's a great mystery that the movie makers didn't at least take advantage of that aspect of the story to treat the viewers to some of the scenery of the West.In the end, there isn't enough compensation for the graphic and disturbing imagery that the movie makes its viewers endure, making this movie a missed opportunity.",Wild

I was particularly moved by the way in which personal relationships were depicted. Characters are revealed in full - and I found myself disarmed time and again with each new interaction, negative or positive, inspiring or terrifying. Personal redemption is never an easy path.

315,mastercoog,Experienced PCT hiker NOT IMPRESSED!,3,3 October 2015,"For the last couple years hiking on the PCT, I have heard about the book the Wild mainly from non-hikers. I curiously watched this to see what the fuss was about. My experience on the trail was vastly different from the portrayal in the movie. Strayed was very inexperienced and most of the drama stems from that. Also most PCT hikers only really worry about the next water source, getting in their miles, and the next resupply stop.I felt the movie did not really capture the every day life of a PCT hiker very well brushing over common hiker dialog and every day tasks. I will note that backpacking has changed a lot since Strayed hiked. The gear is lighter, we use trail runners instead of hiking boots, trekking poles, and the trail is more popular which is good and bad. The most off putting aspect for someone who has hiked the trail before is the locations and terrain vary greatly from the actual trail. Sometimes I felt that Strayed got lost her entire hike climbing over rocks at Smith Rock in Oregon. Aka the PCT is graded for horses. What was she doing? For someone who would like to watch this movie and recreate great memories, I found it very difficult. The simplest way to explain it is her experience depresses my experience. The real trail is far greater than the movie depicts. The solo hiking women I have met on trail are very strong, independent, and are more than capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. There are people I have met on trail with disabilities and amazing life stories that I think would have made a better movie.",Wild

So wake up American women, not everything is picketed fence and this movie doesn't even come close to showing reality of what's nature is like. I can't stand Reese, she represents the most type of obnoxious Americans, that's hated. It's on a bloody walking trail, not like she's hiking some outback country in Australia There's a movie that takes place in outback country in Australia, no hiking path, no halfway house, no people in site.

317,vicenteegarcia,Vicente E. Garcia's Wild Movie Review,8,6 April 2016,"Wild is one of the most fascinating movies which was starred by the award-winning actress Reese Witherspoon and directed by Jean-Marc Vallee. Wild is a story that is based on Cheryl Strayed's # 1New York Times bestseller novel. The StoryAfter several years of being reckless, Cheryl Strayed has already lost her hopes of living when her mother died and her marriage failed to survive. And to celebrate the life that she still has, she traverses the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) - the scenic trail that serves as the pathway from Mexico to Canada. Since Cheryl isn't an experienced hiker, she had a hard time accomplishing the first few miles of her journey. Along the way, she experienced several troubles that made her want to give up and accept that she don't have the guts and capacity to finish the trail. As Cheryl continues to traverse the trail, she experienced several nightmares that remind her of bad experiences and how she misses her mother. Aside from that, Cheryl also met several people who willingly helped and accepted a stranger like her. She met other hikers and they tagged along really well. As time goes by, Cheryl slowly experienced the joy and happiness of being alone and the fulfillment of being independent. The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is a long and tedious path and it continuously challenge Cheryl's capacity to go on and move on. Cheryl's journey continues as she learns to fight her inner evil. There's a heart-warming scene that shows how Cheryl bonded with a child as if she had already forgotten her own heartbreaks. In this scene, Cheryl showed how much she cared for someone whom she just met. As she parted ways with the child, Cheryl realized that there's a good beyond the darkness and obstacles that life has to offer. This made her realized how she misses her mother so much and how hard it is for her to live her life without the one she truly loves. The LessonWild is a movie that teaches the viewers a handful of lessons. First: Cheryl's younger self is reckless and when she grows older, she realized that life isn't always about being drunk and having sex. She accepted the fact that her previous life can't be changed but her future can be a lot different. Second: Being alone doesn't mean that you have to be a lonely person. As Cheryl travel her way through the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), she learned to appreciate the goodness of other people and the beauty of the world that surrounds her. She even learned to smile and be happy again after experiencing the most daunting part of her life. In addition to that, her one-of-a-kind journey taught us to pursue and never give up on the things that we want to achieve. Third: The movie taught us that life isn't always glittering and gold and it isn't always black and dark either. Life gives us a good balance of happiness and sadness. This movie taught us to keep moving forward no matter what kind of obstacle is on our ways.",Wild
318,kylepotts-20033,"Perfect Theme, Lacking a Couple Key Features",8,19 February 2017,"Reese Witherspoon played her role has Cheryl with enough emotion, fear, and pain to make it not only believable, but tough to watch. It's nice to see Reese Witherspoon in a role that doesn't involve her being just a pretty blonde. The outline of the story was very well done and the idea of the theme blended so well with the story, that I felt changed in some way as well. The thing about this movie that really stands out is the way the director makes ever viewer feel as if they are experiencing the pain she is feeling and how relatable she seems at the first point in her journey, clueless but determined. The beginning dragged out but the biggest problem was that most of the suspense and drama were shown in mostly the flashbacks. I mean she is alone in the woods! The part with the creepy redneck and when she ran out of water was about it. There came a time in the movie, where I felt as if she was in no danger on the trail. Understandably the flashbacks were meant for most of the drama, but I believe the two story lines could've connected better through more action on her journey. It was interesting to see two different stories play out well seeing how neither plot could survive without the other. Despite some long parts and unnecessary b role, a key part that made this movie successful was that the resilient and well liked Reese Witherspoon's, Cheryl, was so simple. Cheryl, the protagonist, is a good character for this film. She is not a super being, not a saint, just a person. That's why she becomes so relatable, we want her to win, to beat this trail. Possibly because we would want ourselves to win in this situation, and see a part of us in her. Another idea that was present, was the idea that her journey was symbolic in the sense that it was her way of finding herself, letting go, and freeing herself from the past she desperately held on to. Thus ending her journey with almost seeming enlightened, which for many makes this hike a representation of life itself. Death, fear, sex, all get the heart racing in this Women vs. Nature Drama. Many parts of it became too long, the story could've focused more on the trail, and there could have been more suspense, but the acting, directing, and main theme of the movie help overlook that and make this a well worth 120 minutes.",Wild

It's everything Witherspoon wants to be and isn't.Check out everything you wanted Wild to be - ""Tracks""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2167266/?ref_=nv_sr_1",Wild
320,bugginglilburn,spoilt by poor sound quality,5,23 January 2018,May as well have been in French as I could hardly make out a word of the dialogue. The actors spoke very indistinctly and the volume was practically a whisper. Spoiled an otherwise very good film.,Wild
321,treefrog27,Just really terrible,3,29 November 2016,"Coming from someone who enjoys a good ""woman finding herself through adventure"" 'movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" or ""Eat Pray Love"", this was terrible. Reese really plays an unsympathetic character, deciding with no knowledge of experience to hike the PCT. there are less beautiful outdoorsy shots than I would have imagined. It is filled with jarring flashbacks of her depressing life. But worst of all, this is almost throughout the entire movie. There is basically no part where she improves herself, no chipper feeling to the scenes. She is constantly helped by other people on the trail and never seems appreciative or grateful. She doesn't gain an ability to help others. Reese just did not seem to resonate with her character. She almost seemed empty inside. if this had been rewritten to have a better tone, better relationships with people she meets along the trail, and a much better actress than Reese, it could have been a lot better.",Wild
322,midow-95878,It's marvelous,10,24 January 2019,Really I liked this movie and inspiring for a lot of people to find there self .,Wild
323,rsg7777,Wild it was not,5,16 September 2015,"Five out of 10 is not that bad meaning I give it an OK rating. If you see it on video or for free than you ahead of the game. If you went to the theater than no so much. I'm not going to go into detail about the movie but its just about a story of a woman who screwed up her life, marriage and anything that moved. Then something tragic happens and she goes on a long hike then she forgives herself. That it about all there is to the movie. I would have made this review even shorter but the minimum length of the review is 10 lines so I had to drag the review out and throw in this information about the review to meet the minimum. Hopefully I have now met that minimum and it will let me submit it.",Wild
