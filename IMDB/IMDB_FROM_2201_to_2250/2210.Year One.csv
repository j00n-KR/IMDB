0,TheLittleSongbird,"Unfunny on the whole, but it does look good",3,23 November 2010,"I will start with the good things about Year One. It does look good, the costume and set design actually look as though that some care has gone into them, while the music is at least okay and it was kind of fun spotting the biblical references. However, the story is very repetitive and predictable for my tastes, and there is a weak script and hit and miss sight gags. The direction is lacking too, the pacing is too quick so there's little breathing space and I wasn't taken with the two leads either. Jack Black's performance is lacking a lot in subtlety because he is on autopilot for a vast majority of the movie, so it is left to Michael Cera to deliver the laughs. Unfortunately Cera doesn't manage it, he underplays a little too much and doesn't know what to do with what he's got. Overall, disappointing, it did start off alright actually but the fun isn't stretched over to make a decent enough film. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Year One
1,SnoopyStyle,needs better bromance,6,17 November 2013,"Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) are a couple of bumbling primitive hunter-gatherers. They are banished from the tribe after Zed eats a forbidden fruit. They meet up with Cain (David Cross) who kills Abel. Then they are sold into slavery like the rest of their tribe.It's a bit of broad comedy from director Harold Ramis. He's taken a page out of Mel Brooks' playbook. Jack Black is very good as the braggart slacker bumbling fool. The problem is that he's not that nice to Michael Cera. We need more bromance. That would help the chemistry.There are some great laughs. It's very scattered, but that's the nature of the beast. There's nothing wrong with scatter-shot comedy as long as they hit the mark every once in awhile. It just needs better chemistry from Black and Cera.",Year One
2,Prismark10,Year zero,2,22 April 2014,"This is a silly concept film starring Jack Black and Michael Cera as two cavemen in supposedly pre historic times who wander off and then end up in biblical times first encountering Cain and Abel and ending up in the town of Sodom where they try to free people from their own tribe from slavery.So Year One is a romp that goes from the stone age with hunter & gatherers to farmer & herders to wheeled ox pulled wagons to the time of Abraham and its also a comedy with Jack Black doing his usual stretched out shtick.The film is directed by Harold Ramis who is also a credited co-writer but its been a come down from the heady days of Ghostbusters. Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria and Xander Berkeley are the wasted actors in this lame film that provides few laughs and will leave you open mouthed as to how poor it is.",Year One
3,paul_haakonsen,Disappointing to say the least...,3,11 January 2011,"This movie should have had potential, starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, but no, that was not to be. The movie failed to deliver laughs, and it was a somewhat lukewarm experience.The movie starts off with these Neanderthals/cavemen where you are introduced to Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera), and then pretty much rolls from there and through the bible story. And that for me was fairly weird, and just wrong.What worked for this movie was the impressive cast list they had managed to get together. There are names like Oliver Platt, David Cross, Hank Azaria, Xander Berkeley, and other good actors/actresses. And they all did good work with their roles, unfortunately it just wasn't enough to keep the movie afloat.And what also worked for the movie was the amazing sets and scenery throughout the movie, and the great detail that was put into this. Not to mention the costumes. This was really a treat for the eye, because a lot of effort had been put into this.I only laughed once, yes once, throughout the entire movie. And that was when Oh was hanging upside down and had to pee.The story told in ""Year One"" is pretty straight forward and easy to follow, but it gets a bit too far around to be believable, and it failed to be super funny. So for me this movie was a semi-dead experience. Now, I wasn't bored or anything, but I had just expected a movie of this caliber and with the names on the cast list that they had, that the movie would prove to be more than it turned out to be. Having seen it now, I am certain that I will not be making a second trip back to watch it again. This movie is the type that is watched, then bagged and tagged.",Year One
4,dbborroughs,A major misfire from all concerned,2,15 July 2009,"I think Roger Ebert hit it on the head; this is an example of ""when bad movies happen to good directors"". Story of two guys, (Michael Cerra and Jack Black) who get thrown out of their Stone Age tribe and end up crashing into early biblical history. In theory this is the sort of thing that should have worked, the cast is good, the script seems okay, the sets and such look like they spent a few bucks on it, and unfortunately none of it comes together. The performances are annoying, the sets and costumes look cheap and the jokes seem to have been written by someone one with no sense of humor. Nothing comes together. On paper this should have worked. It's understandable why director Harold Ramis was high on the project since he had some choice elements to work with, but the result is probably his worst film. In its way it's a train wreck since its one of those films that you really can't understand or grasp why it's not working. One of the biggest disappointments of the year, and maybe one of the worst films of the year because it is so painfully nonfunctional as a film.",Year One
5,zardoz-13,Year One is No Fun,2,9 July 2009,"""Analyze That"" director Harold Ramis'Neanderthal comedy ""Year One"" with comedians Jack Black and Michael Cera doesn't add up to much fun. Indeed,little fun is to found in this extended collection of skits set in Biblical times. Primarily, ""Year One"" appears to be an anti-religious rant about the absence of a supreme being and the presence of supremely idiotic humans. The quality of the humor lies well south of the crotch and you'll have a problem smirking at the loud-mouthed antics of our mismatched pair of cretins. Black and Cera certainly constitute no Laurel and Hardy. Several usually solid actors are misplaced here including Vinnie Jones, Hank Azaria, and Oliver Platt playing a high priest with his face plastered with mascara.Our heroes, Zed (Jack Black of ""Nacho Libre"") and Oh (Michael Cera of ""Adventureland""), are wash-outs in an ancient tribe of hunters and gathers at the dawn of history. The movie opens with a wild boar hunt and Zed chunks his spear into the back of a fellow hunter who wears an animal skin that resembles the boar. When the upstart Zed chomps on the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, the tribe throws him out of his village. Zed's one and only friend, Oh, accompanies him into exile on a road trip that takes them into the Old Testament. They meet Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd of ""Role Models""), interrupt Abraham (Hank Arazia of as he is about to slay his son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and promotes a strange new ritual he dubs circumcision: ''Trust me, it will be a sleek look,'' Abraham assures them. ''This is gonna catch on.'' This gag wears out its welcome. Later, our heroes wander into the legendary whore-infested city of Sodom and Gomorrah where ""the sinners are winners."" No, God doesn't rain down his Biblical wrath on this infamous berg. At one point, the hapless Oh is strung up upside down in a dungeon and urinates on himself. Earlier, he is accosted by a flabby, obnoxious gay priest who forces him to rub oil into his hairy chest. Poor Michael Cera is forced to deal with one humiliation after another. Lot forces him to sleep with his farting son and later in Sodom he is painted gold and has to pose as a statue.Ramis and co-scribes Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg of NBC-TV's ""The Office"" emphasize homophobic ""humor."" If you enjoy watching comedians play roles that make them endure one humiliation after another, ""Year One"" is surefire fare.",Year One
6,george.schmidt,Disappointment all around :(,5,6 July 2009,"YEAR ONE (2009) ** Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Vinnie Jones, Hank Azaria, Juno Temple, Olivia Wilde, June Diane Raphael, Xander Berkeley, Gia Carides, Horatio Sanz, Bill Hader, Kyle Gass. Disappointing comedy of the ages that tries in vein to be in the same league as ""HISTORY OF THE WORLD,PART 1"", but misses on almost every mark, even though the gaggle of comic talent (Black & Cera make a fine mismatched team of cavemen-type who wander into Biblical times in search of new lifestyles) is on hand (and largely wasted – i.e. Paul Rudd as Abel the world's first murder victim!) Despite comic genius Harold Ramis (who has a cameo too) at the helm and co-story credit with Gene Supnitsky & Lee Eisenberg, the film feels like a 12:50am skit on SNL that goes nowhere fast).",Year One
7,neil-476,Poor,4,8 July 2009,"I must come clean at the start - I am not a Jack Black fan. No, that's not strictly true: I think he is a good character actor in ensemble pieces (Enemy of the State, Die Hard 4, and even Tropic Thunder all spring to mind) but, as a comic lead, he needs the right vehicle. School of Rock took him far enough away from his routine schtick to be successful: Year One does not.There are three main elements at work here: one, Jack Black and two, Michael Cera, both playing 100% according to their established personae (Black - crude, crass, brash, loud, idiotic, and Cera - constantly talking, self deprecating loser) within the context of three, an anachronism comedy.If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the best bits. There are a few other chuckles, but they are fairly thin on the ground. Indeed, this comedy is distinctive in that you can see quite clearly that particular bits are supposed to be funny, it's just that they simply aren't. Much of this is due to Black. He is not funny. But you also have to blame the mismatch between Black's and Cera's comedy stylings - the two simply don't mesh. And you have to blame the script. It is directed almost entirely to feeding Black's character, and I think that this is why it fails so comprehensively.I was also puzzled as to why the film tossed away such established talent as Paul Rudd, Hank Azaria, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Harold Ramis with minimal cameos, no more than a few lines each, and gave meaty (and spectacularly unfunny) roles to Vinnie Jones (a psycho centurion), Oliver Platt (a camp priest) and David Cross (a ubiquitous Cain).Juno Temple, as Eema, is cute as a button and given absolutely no chance to do anything at all.A thoroughly disappointing effort.",Year One
8,evanston_dad,Jack Black + Loin Cloth = Yikes!,6,16 November 2009,"""Year One"" was about what I expected, so I wasn't disappointed. It's juvenile, hit and miss funny, light as a feather. I was in the mood for mind candy, and that's exactly what I got.Jack Black and Michael Cera play Jack Black and Michael Cera, though they're supposed to be playing primitive humans who ""discover"" the civilized world when they're banished from their village. The funniest jokes are those skewering famous religious stories and characters. The least funny are those involving farting, eating sh*t and man-on-man oil rubs. Some other good actors, like Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Paul Rudd and Harold Ramis (who also directed), show up and are wasted to greater and lesser extents by the material. But to be too critical of a movie like this actually shows less than more cinematic knowledge. It would be like a foodie voluntarily eating at a McDonald's and then complaining about its quality.Grade: B",Year One
9,anaconda-40658,In Year One Ramis Made Caddyshack.,6,9 July 2015,"Year One (2009): Dir: Harold Ramis / Cast: Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross, Olivia Wilde: Amusing idea that jumbles together a series of Biblical or historical events. It stars Jack Black and Michael Cera as tribesmen who are banned when Black eats from the tree of Eden. From there it's a series of subplots through ancient history all of which are offensive or vulgar. Directed by Harold Ramis with effective production throughout. He previously made the mediocre Bedazzled, which also takes shots at Christianity however its altered promises by Satan at least bare certain truth. While Ramis is efficient enough this hardly ranks among his funniest films which includes such superior comedies as Analyze This, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, and National Lampoon's Vacation. Black and Cera are funny but historical moments are hard hitting to the most offensive degree, and as the film reaches its climax. Oliver Platt plays a high priest whom they must face and obviously overthrow. David Cross as Cain is hilarious but unfortunately this version of Cain showcases exactly why this film is offensive. Olivia Wilde plays a princess and it isn't one of her better roles. Christianity is mocked to the extremes, which indicates certain viewers will more than likely detest the spectacle. The result is a formula driven yet visually well made mockery of history. Score: 6 / 10",Year One
10,movieman_kev,'jokes' that are biblically ancient,2,25 November 2009,"Cavemen Zed and Oh (Jack Black and Michael Cera respectively) go of on a journey after Zed gets banished from their tribe for eating from the forbidden tree of knowledge. Their adventures take them to the murderous Cain (Mr. Show's David Cross) and the city of Sodom where they must save the girls that they love (the tribe got raided soon after they had left) in this supposed comedy.Poor Harold Ramis ever since the 2000's started his films became unwatchable. All the more heartbreaking when one realizes then earlier he had made such classics as Groundhog Day, Stripes, Caddyshack, Ghost Busters & Back to School. This film, however, has nothing going for it. You get both Black and Cera doing their (now tiresome) schticks while going through a half baked plot filled with jokes so stale that I doubt that they even seemed new in the time that this film takes place. Simply unfunny at best and soul crushing at worst.My Grade: D-DVD Extras: Commentary with Director Harold Ramis, Jack Black, and Michael Cera; Alternate Ending;2 Deleted Scenes; 10 Extended & Alternate Scenes; line-o-rama; Gag Reel; 3 Featurettes (The Journey Begins which is a Making-Of, Sodom's Got 'Em is a fake ad for the aforementioned city, and Leeroy Jenkins; The Gates of Sodom is a short scene) ; Trailer for this Movie and Trailers for ""Whatever Works"", ""The Ugly Truth"", "" Black Dynamite"", ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", ""Moon"" & ""Blood the Last Vampire""",Year One
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Year One,6,13 September 2009,"Compared to the other comedy, I had somehow enjoyed Year One a lot more than Dance Flick if not because the latter had lacked more coherent scenes, slapping incident after incident of spoofs in clear narrative disregard in what would be a sad state of affairs where Hollywood comedies are concerned. Year One, written and directed by veteran Harold Ramis was a lot more fun, even though it had Jack Black and Michael Cera not in top form while playing off one another.As the trailer would have already suggested, Black plays Zed, a bumbling hunter who just cannot spear, and is seen as a chief liability to his tribe. His good friend Oh (Cera) is not a favorite either, in an era where only those who cannot, become gatherers in a time where one's career is either one of the other. Driven out of their tribe, or the duo would like everyone to think that they are seeking better fortunes, so begins a life full of adventures, self-discovery and the likes, involving capturing of prisoners and the rescuing of the loves of their lives Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple), quite like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto, except our characters here all speak English.Ramis went imaginatively wild with the premise, setting the stage for our unlikely heroes to meet up with various Old Testament legends, like Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd respectively) and their parents, Abraham (Hank Azaria) and Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, aka McLovin from Superbad), amongst others. As we are likely to know what was recorded in books, Ramis played it fast and loose, and short of being blasphemous, was actually insanely fun, given huge does of self-deprecating and toilet humor, courtesy of Cera and Black.With themes like friendship, developing of character strength and redemption, perhaps what would make you sit up and take notice, is the film's rather pointed aim at religious fanaticism and the belief in self-proclaimed prophets. As the people of the land suffer from a prolonged drought, it is the clergies and the self-righteous who claim to have direct links with the guy upstairs, who eat and sleep good, while creating a mythical aura of invincibility surrounding their beings. Which of course Zed and Oh tear down in a jiffy, and in quite an unnecessary, unfunny but preachy tone, set out to make a comment or two with regards to such profiteering of mankind's superstition.Jack Black and Michael Cera didn't exactly share much chemistry together as buddies, which Ramis had preferred that they stick tot their duly recognizable stereotypes of the bumbling idiot, and the nerdy, less athletic sidekick with a penchant for weak sarcasm and self- deprecation. Most of the jokes here work, though some invariably had to fall off from being too cheesy, but all in all, something that's still quite enjoyable especially if you're in a crappy mood, or just booked out from camp.",Year One
12,namashi_1,Disappointing...,5,26 September 2009,"Harold Ramis has made entertaining films before this, made classics to be honest. I loved Ghostbusters, I am a huge fan of his underrated film 'Multiplicity'. But his latest offering 'Year One, which he has written, produced & directed disappoints.'Year One' could've been a classic affair, I mean Ramis had history in his hands. Agreed, no need to preach us with the goods & bads then, but why making an over-the-top comedy. Which has hardly a few jokes or moments that you take home! By Making Jack Black eat poop or showing Oliver Platt being oiled by Michael Cera funny, then I should be the funniest man in the planet. And the climax of the film is the weakest part of this venture.... it just doesn't create an impact as one expects. Acting-wise: Jack Black can never be doubted when it comes to comedy. He's fantastic, as ever. Michael Cera is excellent as well. Oliver Platt plays his character well, but it's sad to such a great performer like him being reduced to such roles. David Cross is strictly okay. Others lend able support. On the whole, are Ancestors are just not interesting.",Year One
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Year One is painfully awful... I'm not kidding, this movie physically hurt!",1,20 June 2009,"Jack Black and Michael Cera playing themselves, yeah, where was that even considered funny? Now I absolutely adore these actors, Michael was a great choice in Superbad and Juno and Jack Black has proved he can do great comedy like Tropic Thunder and a good dramatic role like King Kong, even a more calm character like he played in The Holiday. But the main problem? They have no chemistry! You have this wild outgoing maniac who is eating poop(eeeew!) and the calm awkward overly shy nerd who pees on himself(eeew!) and what do you have? Every elementary school joke that could be put into a movie, Year One could have been written by a five year old and proves that top list actors will do anything for those millions that they make.Jack Black and Michael Cera headline Harold Ramis' Biblical comedy about a pair of misfit hunter-gatherers who embark on a wild journey through the ancient world after being banished from their primitive village. Zed and Oh may lack in the skills that their chieftain is looking for, but they have plans to make it big. Zed has a gut feeling that God has ""chosen"" him, and so he leads his buddy on a trip through the unknown countryside in search of bigger and better things, bumping into several weird characters along the way -- like a feuding pair of brothers named Cain and Abel. Unfortunately, their quest for greatness hits a few snags, like being sold into slavery, and later becoming the object of interest to a very amorous, very hairy high priest in the opulent city of Sodom.You have to understand, I wanted to love this movie, from the minute that I saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be such a great movie, but once again they showed all the funny parts in the trailer. During the movie I fell asleep and my boyfriend tried to wake me up and I said ""OMG, I was dreaming that I was watching this movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera think that they're funny oh, no, just let me sleep"". Seriously, this movie was beyond painfully bad, I don't understand how anybody could find this kind of humor funny. Year One has everything that should equal a good comedy and that was the funny cast, but thanks to the bad direction and awful concept, Year One falls completely flat. Stay as far away from this trash as you can, this film should be used only to torture possible terrorists into telling the US where they hide their nuclear weapons.1/10",Year One
14,KineticSeoul,"Awful movie, if you seen the trailer you basically saw all the jokes and the jokes aren't even funny in the trailer",1,11 March 2011,"Okay so if you basically seen the trailer you basically saw all the main jokes in this movie. Jack Black does what he always do in his movies and Michael Cera is the same old Michael Cera. I didn't find this movie even the least bit funny, I didn't even get a chuckle out of this. I have no idea how anyone can actually find this movie to be funny, maybe hardcore atheist probably force some laughs out of this. Maybe they have different sense of humor, but besides that I don't know how anyone can find this movie humorous. It's like the characters in this just tries super hard to be funny by acting all obnoxious and stuff, but it's just not funny. Just cause the characters act all obnoxious and act all stupid isn't always humorous. Almost during the whole movie I was just anxious for this movie to just end or at least get to a decent scene but it just never happened.

15,thesar-2,Which one year were they referring to?,2,8 November 2009,"Which ""one year"" were they planning on filming? 'Year One' jumps all over the place with more time traveling than the 'Back to the Future' trilogy. And it just doesn't stop there; as many as the scenes blend from one time-period to hundreds years later, scenes also just start/stop without rhyme or reason. In other words, bad editing. It was as if they thought if they could get Black and Cera together no matter the result, it would be funny and profitable. It was neither. Okay, I take that back: the movie actually gets a half star more because Cera did deliver some funny one-liners. But that didn't hold the mess the rest of the movie was. And what's with the incessant need to prove one's heterosexuality? 'Fired Up!' is another example of a two-dude-buddy-comedy that states up front that these men are attracted to the opposite sex, yet throws it in our faces countless times to remind us they're not gay. We get it. If this is all you can base comedy on, you must've been working with three pages of a script and then ask the actors to improvise the rest of the movie. Bad choice. We follow Zed and Oh from their disgraced departure from their tribe through multiple and random Bible stories. So random, I'm shocked they didn't get Moses and Jesus in the same room for a skit. At any rate, the very thin plot has them attempting (only at particular times) to rescue two women they knew from their tribe. Black phoned his performance is and should be ashamed at acting goofy thinking that's enough for today's audience. Cera plays his signature role.

Well, when go on their travels, all of a sudden they are meeting biblical characters. That puts the timeline way off.The script for this was awful.

Two cavemen bond together to rescue the women they love from the wretches of Sodom.The acting is nothing to scream home about but I seen worst performances. Jack Black seemed like he had no conviction in saying his lines. I did like Michael Cera's character. He seemed like a innocent person with the worst luck. Oliver Platt should not be in this movie at all with his horrid performance.

I shut this off, and couldn't finish it. I avoided this movie for over 4 years, because I read all the bad reviews, and it simply looked terrible. I should have stayed away from it, because it's as bad as I feared. For starters, these two speak awfully well for being ancient. I get that you're supposed to kick your brain to the curb, but must it be so moronic? Jack Black & Michael Cera, essentially play themselves, and are completely unfunny. I was especially annoyed by Jack Black. I usually like Michael Cera, but he has no idea how to handle this part. They wear these ridiculous looking wigs, and it just comes across as extremely lazy.

Just because the film deals with a couple of morons meeting crazed religious figure don't get a free pass on that. Yes, people get offended by movies mocking their religion, but the film fails to be a great religious satire comedy. It fails to be anything, but mediocre due to horrible acting, unfunny crude and dark humor. Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) are two members of a hunter/gatherer society. Both are getting mistreated and hatred as both seek a way out. Zed ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but catch by the shaman (Bill Hader) who banished him from the tribe. Oh decides to go with Zed in exile out of their Eden like place. Along the way, they encounter Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd). Cain kills Abel and informs Zed and Oh that they must escape with him or else be accused of killing Abel as well. They find out that the girls that they had crush on, Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple) have been captured by Sodomites and being sold into slavery. Cain ends up betraying Zed and Oh and sold them as slaves. Zed and Oh escape and hide in the desert, and find Abraham (Hank Azaria) about to kill his son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Zed stops them, claiming that the Lord sent him to do so. Abraham takes them to his Hebrew village and tells them about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Zed and Oh head off for Sodom after Abraham decides to circumcise them. They arrive in Sodom, where they hide as guards noticing princess Inanna (Olivia Wilde) looking for chance and get rid of the high priest (Oliver Platt). The two are on the quest to save the princess, the town and their girls. This movie had the potential to be a good concept. Two nobody guys witness bible events from the background could be potential to be funny, but the writing became lazy by putting a bunch of potty jokes and other childish humor. Critics just can't stand to give praise to films with gross out humor because they feel it is beneath them. Yes, it does have some disgusting jokes, but they are few, the bulk of the film is silly characters doing silly things. It is not going to win any awards, but it is simple fun. Harold Ramis is much smarter than this. It's not the best from him, but the film has amazing sets, and supporting cast, but the main characters felt like Jack Black and Michael Cera acting as themselves in a periodic piece. Cera felt like as like watching a dead guy shuffle around and say lines. Jack Black acts stupid. The characters regardless of the stupid comedy had real chemistry.

Oh is in love, and Zed is simply lazy, and the others in the tribe look down upon them. While they are out one day, goofing off, they come across the forbidden tree and eat from it, and are then kicked out of the tribe. They the wonder around the ancient world, meeting Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, and then land up at Sodom where they discover that their tribe have become slaves.The movie is very loosely based upon the biblical stories in the early part of Genesis, and I say loosely because most of the movie is built around Zed and Oh going from being goof balls to rescuing their tribe from slavery and freeing the people of Sodom from the evil high priest.Personally, there is not really much else I want to write about this film simply because the jokes weren't really all that funny, just crude, and the film not all that original.

The American critics aren't happy with it, though if Monty Python had made it, which isn't impossible, they'd be a whole lot more enthusiastic. ('Life of Brian' and 'Apocalypto'were both inspirations.) Ramis succeeds very well in his purpose, which is to entertain and make us laugh. There's a range in the humor from the crude to the subtly satirical. Ramis dips lower than the Brits and doesn't fly as high, but there's some wit and for a few moments the Old Testament gets taken for a bracingly wild ride. The basic joke, well emphasized in the colloquial dialogue, is the contrast between the modern sensibility of the two protags and the ancient settings they roam through.Ramis gets off to a good start by combining the crude, boisterous Jack Black and the dry, fey Michael Cera as buddies from a stone-age tribe: they make a good contrast, Black's invincible confidence set off against Cera's restraint and exquisite timing. Zed (Black) and Oh( Cera) are outcast members of a hunter-gatherer village: Zed is full of bravado, daring to sample the apple of the tree of knowledge, for all the good it does him (which is none), but still a totally incompetent hunter. Oh is a multi-talented gatherer, the smartest guy in town, though as he says, ""that's a low bar."" Oh was the one who thought of using gourds to drink out of instead of cupping one's hands (""it just seemed practical""). Oh and Zed, Cera and Black, provide a running series of jokes about masculinity and intelligence throughout. Ramis has fun with Cera's girlish voice and soft face. He's still the smartest guy around -- and also a big guy, towering above squat, plump Jack. Oh's also unmistakably interested in girls, proclaiming himself to be a ""male virgin,"" a status he is aiming to lose. But his looks mean he has to watch out for Zaftig the bald eunuch (Kyle Gass) and the flaming hirsute high priest of Sodom (Oliver Platt).Dramatically different levels of civilization coexist in Ramis' ancient times, as they do now. 'Year One' is a quick run-through of some early stages of human history. The neolithic pals quickly run into some farmers with domesticated animals, who turn out to be a nastily squabbling Cain and Abel, and some mean Biblical fun begins, leading from fratricide to the discovery of the tiresome old blowhard Abraham. His son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of 'Superbad'), whom they save from being sacrificed, emerges as a rebellious pot-smoking teenager who likes to sneak off to Sodom to party (as what teenager wouldn't?). When Zed and Oh hears about this sink of depravity they can't wait to go there themselves, despite Abraham's condemnation. Anyhow they have to escape Abe's clutches before he circumcises them, a new idea they don't particularly fancy.Things go on in this vein. A lot of the action takes place in Sodom. The Old Testament Hebrews are just a stopover on the way, though they pop up again later. It's a wild ride for Zed and Oh, who go from wearing animal skins to giving oil massages and losing their virginity backstage at a palace revolt. That elaborately staged scene (the budget was $60 million) shows Ramis shot this more like a Biblical blockbuster than a penny-pinching Python flick, and the changing costumes and hair styles are fun. But I'll be honest with you. Jack Black is wearing a bit thin (metaphorically, that is), and it's chiefly Cera, with his casual, throwaway delivery of the best lines, who breathes freshness into this.",Year One
24,elshikh4,"Where term like ""I felt needles in my eyes"" doesn't express the case rightly !",1,3 February 2012,"OK, they wanted to make a comedy. Not bad. They aimed at new atmosphere. Why not? The thing is they filled their movie with nothing but heavy filth, and frank blasphemy!It's not about ""not enjoying it"", it's about being deadly sick while watching it. For every minute, this movie throws on you something agonizingly disgusting. I wanted to have a good time, not turning into a toilet seat!Is it bankruptcy? Is it a scary desire to be dirty? Is it conspiracy to smash holiness, history, cinema and comedy all at once?!! All what I know is that Hollywood used to excrete its nastiest venoms on us unrestrainedly lately under the name of entertainment.Usually it's difficult to stand (Jack Black) doing his antics. This round, he was at his lowest conditions ever, delivering poor, unfunny and loathsome performance. In fact, he did nothing but gazing, nodding, and saying Hmmm. However, no one shocked me more than (Harold Ramis). The maker of (Ghost Busters), and (Groundhog Day), now gives us (Year one)?? I don't know about you, but that kills me apart!As a whole, expressions like ""I felt needles in my eyes"" become imprecise, and a word like ""Ugly"" isn't only soft, but so praising to use. They wanted to be no tacky, to make one of the worst tacky movies of all time. I just want to tell whoever made it a really sincere piece of advice: You have real problems, try to seek help soon.P.

Not to mention he co starred and co wrote the two Ghostbusters(1984-1989). Hard to believe that Harold Ramis would resort to the level of unfunny. He used to know what funny is. Has he forgotten, I think not. Year One for Harold Ramis is just an unfortunate misfire.This movie was going from bad to worse to the point where I just left before it ended. I really wanted to like this movie, but nothing was jumping off the screen, I heard very little laughs in the theater, none of the characters where the least bit interesting. Jack Black and Michael Cera are alright, but both of them can't seem to grab much appeal to make this movie entertaining. Michael Cera is always an entertaining presence, but after seeing this film, I doubt his career will go very far as it's gonna go. Same goes on the boat for Jack Black. David Cross(Mr. Show) is so amazingly unfunny in his co starring role. So was Christopher Mintz-Plasse in his role, I think after this film he should be called Mc-DouschbagIf you're looking for a better and funnier film, then go see The Hangover instead.",Year One
26,PWNYCNY,Oliver Platt's greatest movie.,10,7 July 2009,"This is Oliver Platt's greatest movie. Mr. Platt has never been funnier than in this movie. In fact, he carries the movie and should have been given top billing. Mr. Platt was so funny that it elevated the performances of all the other players, especially Michael Cera's whose scenes with Mr. Platt have to be among the funniest in years. The plot is pure schmaltz and the acting right out of the Mel Brooks school of comedy. Jack Black was absolutely wonderful as the lead player and does a great job in each and every scene. This zany movie is definitely worth the price of admission. The movie features goofy dialogue, great comedy acting, a fast paced plot and a happy ending. In other words, it offers the audience a great entertainment package.",Year One

I made the right choice.Dumb movie but I still liked it. It was fun, Jack Black and Michael Cera together is a mixture that's hard to beat. It's not comedy gold but it was more than adequately distracting. The parade of biblical characters was kind of subversive and fun. Pity it got a bit more gross than it could justify by context but whatever.",Year One
28,arthur_tafero,Black and Cera cannot save this turkey,3,24 May 2018,"I like Jack Black and I like Cera as well. Harold Ramis is a funny man, and very talented. However, this turkey could have been made (and looked like it was made) for 6M instead of 60M. I liked some of the skits in the film (the killing of Abel and one or two of the Sodom scenes). However, three scenes and five good minutes cannot rescue a rambling mess. To be viewed only if it is free.

29,dwpollar,Just miss beginning of the world comedy...,5,12 December 2009,"1st watched 11/26/2009 – 5 out of 10 (Dir-Harold Ramis): Just miss beginning of the world comedy with a good team of Jack Black & Michael Cera. They are definitely funny as a team in this movie, but as in a lot of comedies – they try to add an action/hero story and romance that doesn't fit in real well with the comedy. The movie started to slow down when they settled in Sodom and tried to free their countrymen amidst the chaos. The story starts as two misfit cavemen partake of the forbidden fruit and send themselves from the village to find the end of the world and whether it truly is the end. They find out that it doesn't end—by golly!! – and then meet up with Cain and Abel as well as Abraham and Isaac from the biblical stories and then the city of Sodom. It was interesting they way the filmmakers mixed cavemen with biblical stories and Black & Cera have a definite comic touch and work well together but again it fell apart when they got to Sodom and kept the rest of the story there. We get a very weird Oliver Pratt gay high-priestess silly character, which doesn't help the film and the final hour where the hero's try to save the day. Shtick doesn't carry itself throughout a whole movie, as we see again from director Harold Ramis --- who has become a master of these type of movies, despite his abilities in bringing excellent comic teams to the screen.",Year One
30,TOMNEL,"There's not very many horribly bad moments, but at the same time, there's very few funny moments.",5,25 June 2009,"From the reviews, this movie seemed like it would be horribly bad, and full of annoying cringe worthy moments, but this is not true at all. Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.Zed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.Jack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.One big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.My rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.",Year One

32,Enchorde,Entertaining but nothing to remember,6,6 March 2010,"Recap: Zed and Oh are two loser stone age men that are kicked out from the village after Zed first ate from the forbidden fruit (and then accidentally torched Oh's hut). Together the two go on an epic adventure through the worst parts of the old Biblical times. Their quest is to save the two girls from the village that they intend to make theirs, but have been taken as slaves by much more advanced empires.Comments: A pretty entertaining movie even if many of the jokes are a little low and juvenile. I did see the unrated version on DVD, so some of those jokes maybe didn't make it to the theatrical version. It doesn't really utilize the potential in the story which is mostly well written with a god set of fun characters. But even if the story is good the movie doesn't really take off, possibly because of the tempo that is unusually low. Now and again there are scenes that slow down the pace considerably, often combined with a low joke about sex, at best, or excrements at worst.Jack Black's character is a typical Black character, and it isn't so new anymore. Zed is egoistic, self centered and thinks too highly of himself. He also tries to use his friends for his own good, not being a very good friend at all, but changing in the end. Black does it well, but we have seen it many times. The other cast is impressive, even if Black's sidekick Michael Cera is rather unknown to me. Three beautiful ladies in June Diane Raphael, Juno Temple and Olivia Wilde support, but the cast also includes veterans and solid actors like Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Xander Berkely, and also David Cross, Vinnie Jones, Horatio Sanz, among many others.It had its moments, and over all it was funny. But many other comedies, both old and recent, are better than this. Still worth the time if you happen to come by it, even if it isn't perhaps worth the money to rent.6/10",Year One
33,lewiskendell,What can I say? I liked it.,7,22 April 2010,"I had heard so many horrible things about Year One, that I initially planned on skipping it all-together. It's been a while since I've seen a comedy be so universally panned by critics. But I simply couldn't ignore the fact that Olivia Wilde was in it. Olivia always wins in the end. I can see why a lot of people would not like it. The references to religion would probably turn some off, and it's not not a ""smart"" comedy by any means. Then you have those people who are tired of (or never liked in the first place) Michael Cera and Jack Black. If you didn't like them in other movies, you won't like them here. The most glaring negative, though, is that a lot of the jokes fall horribly flat. Fart jokes? In 2009? Really?But when a joke finally does work, it's a home-run. I laughed hysterically at least 5 times, and that made this movie worth the time investment, to me. Getting plenty of opportunities to ogle Juno Temple and Olivia didn't hurt, either. I could care less about the religious aspects of the movie, and I certainly wasn't perturbed by the liberties the plot took with biblical history. It's just a silly movie, and I have no problems keeping things like that from offending my religious sensibilities. Year One is by no means a comedy classic, but it's nowhere near what I consider to be horrible. I'm willing to admit that I probably enjoyed it more than it deserves, but that doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't mind seeing it again. I've seen much, much worse comedies. Don't be afraid to rent it or check it out on TV, if you're interested.",Year One
34,Chase_Witherspoon,Not the greatest story ever told,5,21 May 2011,"I bought this DVD outright on the strength of the reputation of its stars Black and Cera, with whom at the time I was particularly fond having recently seen ""Superbad"", and listening to Tenacious D. So, it was disappointing to experience this rather half-cooked comedy from comedic royalty Harold Ramis. Essentially as the title suggests, the movie takes us from outside the Garden of Eden where Black and Cera are forced into exile for trivial nonsense, through the first few chapters of the Old Testament as they encounter Cain & Abel (Cross and Rudd), Sodom and Gomorrah and other historical types on their way to glory.While the film has a certain Mel Brook's feel, sadly most of the jokes fall flat, especially Platt as a sexually ambiguous priest so over the top it's embarrassing to watch. Black is his usual unrestrained self and Cera basically plays the same character from all his movies, though the two do form a likable duo of the bad influence (Black) exploiting his young companion's (Cera) naivety. Not without a few chuckles here and there (the circumcision scene with Azaria is a cracker), it doesn't deliver consistently and in retrospect, I probably would've rented rather than purchased.",Year One
35,bob-rutzel-1,A Comedy? Not a Chance,1,18 October 2009,"Cavemen Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) are banished from their tribe and venture West (?) and we see the beginnings, sort of, of what the Old Testament was not like. But, the markers on their travels are shown to us anyway: Forbidden Fruit, Cain and Able, the Wheel (really), Romans, Circumcision (only talked about), Sodom (we never saw the other city), a Chosen One (Zed), and, of course, human sacrifices. They discover their girl friends (?) were captured and the two are determined to set them free. I kind of knew what I was getting into with a Jack Black movie. I've seen others. I was not disappointed. This one is entirely pointless, humorless, crude, sick, disgusting in places and there is crude use of sexual content throughout. Some subtle, some not so. And, again I wonder why people make movies like this, why some still go to movies like this or better yet why some actually give movies like this a fairly good review. I won't, I promise. I stayed just so I could write this review and yes, I hoped that the movie would somehow save itself. Not a chance. I knew that. Comedy is not Jack Black's strength. Selling cars or drama movies may be. I have always said that the really bad comics (who think they are funny) should try drama. They have the timing for that, but surely not comedy. Yes, I am acutely aware they are not funny all the way to the bank. There were no laughs in here, but I did get a kick out of Maya's (June Raphael) comment to Zed early on when she says, ""You make me laugh."" HA! Well, it was in the script, so she can be forgiven. I couldn't believe that Oliver Platt was in this, but he was.Actually, the Writers are the real culprits, maybe the Director and the Producer(s). The only good thing to come out of all this was that the movie did employ many and in these days, that's something. And, to be fair, the rest of the cast did perform well, and if there was any sign of a good script, perhaps Jack could have been better. I don't really believe that, but it's in the realm of possibility. Okay, it's not.I am really tempted to say the next line: This is so bad a real Caveman wouldn't watch it.Could I be wrong, and is it possible that, maybe, just maybe, there was nothing funny in the actual Year One?

37,Screen_Blitz,A dull comedy of biblical proportions,4,1 November 2015,"Director Harold Ramis takes us back the old ages with this slipshod comedy partially based on the Book of Genesis, starring an amazing cast of Jack Black, Michael Cera, David Cross, Oliver Platt, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Vinnie Jones, and Hank Azaria. Jack Black plays Zed, a caveman living off in a poor village, surviving from hunting and gathering from animals. Zed is unhappy about the village life as is friend Oh (Michael Cera), who tries unsuccessfully to win the heart of one of the village girls Ema (Juno Temple), and Zed who is in love with Maya (June Diane Raphael). While trekking outside the boundaries of the village, Zed and Oh come across the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil where Zed eats the forbidden fruit. Thus, Zed becomes cursed and flees from the village with Oh and travels to the city of Sodom ruled by a cruel priest (Oliver Platt). In the process, they encounter the murder of Abel (Paul Rudd) by his brother Cain (David Cross) and the attempted killing of Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) by father Abraham (Hank Azaria).Despite the talented cast, this movie falls short of nothing but one-joke comedy. It introduces a fresh idea, although genuinely similar to the popular Monty Python films such as The Holy Grail and Life of Brian. This film tries to get out the laughs from dull humor and stale dialogue, some of the humor is hilarious, but most of it falls flat. Apparently since this is set in the year one as described by the title, the jokes have to be ""year one"". The film struggles to come with inspiring humor other than light-hearted reenactments of the killing of Abel and binding of Isaac. Jack Black and Michael Cera manage to steal at least most of the spotlight with occasionally funny gags and dialogue, the rest of the cast left with nothing funny or remotely exciting to bring to the table. The biggest dilemma is not the cast nor the acting, but the lazy screenplay.Year One is quite a disappointing comedy for such an amazing cast, with lame jokes and lame script. Unless you are avid Jack Black and Michael Cera fan, this film mostly not for you.",Year One
38,dunmore_ego,The Year of Living Safely.,6,13 October 2009,"Either Jack Black is being reined in with a poor script, squelched by a conventional director, or he's just plain getting' too old for this sh*t.Maybe a combo-wombo of all three? YEAR ONE is a missed opportunity, crying in the wilderness like Charlton Heston as Moses; a biblical comedy of pamphlet proportions.Black is Zed, an inept caveman hunter; his best friend is Oh (Michael Cera), a willowy gatherer from the same small tribe. To score a tribeswoman, Maya (June Diane Raphael, almost more luminous than Maggie Gyllenhaal in DONNIE DARKO), Zed eats of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (what are the odds it's right near their village?). Zed and Oh are subsequently banished from the village - not by God but by their tribe - and what started as a promising premise (a comedy featuring cavemen with modern day sensibilities) loses itself in expanding way past its time period; past its Use By date, so to speak.For every time Zed and Oh meet new characters, the characters are in a further evolutionary epoch - for example, the first people they encounter are Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), with writer-director Harold Ramis himself cameoing as Adam. One night in Genesis and the next day, Zed and Oh encounter Greek soldiers, circa 3,000 BC, led by Vinnie Jones (they look like Romans, but Ramis tells us the costumes were researched as Greek). Then we're back to biblical times when Zed and Oh meet Abraham (Hank Azaria) and trek to Sodom.Hank Azaria bludgeons us as Abraham, cutting his words like a machete (channeling George C. Scott's Abraham from THE BIBLE: IN THE BEGINNING, 1966), as he would start cutting foreskins on a whim for the sake of honoring his god. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (aka McLovin) is Isaac, the son who was saved from being a human sacrifice by ""an angel"" in the bible, but here, by Zed and Oh. (Like McLovin, Isaac tries to scam liquor cos he's too young.) Oliver Platt goes hell-tilt as the high priest of Sodom, falling hopelessly in perverse love with his golden-painted bitch, Oh, forcing him to rub body-oil into his matted jungle of chest hair that makes Paul Stanley's chest look like Hugh Grant's.Olivia Wilde is the princess of Sodom (chosen as Maxim's Hottest Female of 2009 - guess there's no accounting for taste - if a woman is that flat, is appearing topless any kind of coup?), who really has nothing to do except pretend to be hotter than June Diane Raphael.Look for Kyle Gass (Tenacious D's rage kage) as the Eunuch.YEAR ONE takes no risks – of course there are funny moments – these are great comedians - David Cross's constant underhandedness, Azaria's obsession with circumcision, Platt's obsession with body oil, and a few zingers that make the trailers. But I had higher hopes, considering Judd Apatow is one of the producers.Besides a watery questioning of organized religion, YEAR ONE resolves with little fanfare and nothing interesting to say.An Alternate Ending on the DVD shows the destruction of Sodom. That might have worked better than the lame theatrical release. If you've got nothing to say, at least say it loud with fireballs.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Year One
39,pyrocitor,"High concept, low laughs",4,2 July 2009,"Conceiving a contemporary comedy remains a treacherous affair, and a painstaking balance to avoid a slew of easy pitfalls. On one hand, producers would want to avoid having the film be too inextricably conceived, so as to prevent talented stars from improvising and riffing and having a stilted, excessively scripted feel. Yet at the same time, the fear of overly liberal direction remains ever present, resulting in narrative shambles with either too many or too few ideas dampening the film throughout. That being said, it remains particularly frustrating how Harold Ramis' Year One, despite suggesting one of the most promisingly comedic combinations of story and cast in years, manages to succumb to not only one of the aforementioned concerns, but all of them simultaneously: a meandering mess managing to feel both irritatingly structured and formulaic while simultaneously lacking in terms of content or coherent thought, all the while sorely lacking in laughs or purpose. The foremost concern of Ramis' film is its want for ideas big enough to match its scope... or ideas of any sort. While the premise would suggest a caustic biblical satire, the outcome yields one with no bite, or even much of an attempted nibble. Even the irreverent silliness of Monty Python's Life of Brian, which poked fun at similar subject matter, had enough pointed wit and daring political incorrectness to justify its ensuing religious controversy, thus demonstrating an underlying point in the midst of its random hilarity. Year One attracted no such uproar not because of changing social politics, but simply because its aims are too low to warrant any. One gets the feeling of the film bypassing the planning stage of its story in lieu of a vague declaration such as ""oh we'll throw in a few fart, poo and genitalia jokes - people will love it!"", making the film feel just as under-thought as under-planned. As such, while the humour on display might appeal to certain less discerning 15 or under year old males (and few else), even for them it is a bit of a stretch to expect more than a handful of chuckles. From the first couple of minutes it becomes clear that the film shoots for stupid rather than satirical, but the dimensions of its stupidity and sheer lack of the sort of demented energy which makes similar efforts fly only expand over time. Furthermore, as if the scatological and sexual humour were not thin and worn at best, Ramis often repeats the same shoddy jokes numerous times in a row, as if attempting to bludgeon his audience into laughing, carrying a vaguely patronising as well as mostly woefully unfunny tone. In fact, when the most obviously laudable component to such mainstream comedic fair is that its period costuming and sets are impressive, it is clear that its worth as a film is sorely lacking. The film should only really be considered worth a look for die-hard, unconditionally forgiving fans of Jack Black or Michael Cera, and even for them a viewing remains somewhat of a leap of faith. While both are on firmly familiar territory (Black's wild-eyed, hyper troublemaker and Cera's neurotic, angsty and lovable nerd), the fish-out-of-water juxtaposition of their personas with an ancient time period feels more jarring and irritating than funny, and their respective charm and clunky but functional comedic chemistry is not enough to make the film as a whole work. The star stuffed supporting cast does little better, their appearances often feeling tiresome rather than welcomely surprising, and each ill- advised schtick does little to evoke laughs. Most, such as David Cross' murderous Cain and Christopher Mintz-Plasse's rebellious Isaac opt for punching their one note characters in as loud and banal a fashion as possible, as if hoping to wear the audience into submission. Oliver Platt's obscenely over the top flamboyant High Priest proves a particularly distasteful example of such a technique. The array of female performers (Juno Temple, Olivia Wilde and June Dianne Raphael) do demonstrate quirky charisma, but are stuck in such woefully underwritten love interest roles that they are given little chance to demonstrate their performance potential. Highlights do emerge: the woefully underused Hank Azaria puts a welcomely inventive spin on his well meaning but misguided Abraham, and Vinnie Jones has a great time snarling menacingly as a military general, but on the whole, it is nothing less than a colossal waste to see such collective talent go to waste. While the film has enough stupid charm to prevent it from becoming a complete travesty, Year One can be considered little more than an epic of a wasted opportunity, comedic potential squandered in favour of repetitive, irritatingly lowbrow and unimaginative potty jokes and an unwelcome fear of aiming at any contentious satirical cracks. While it is true that there are less enjoyable ways of spending an afternoon, attempting to find them out would be a potentially lethal prospect, and as such, it would be safer to advise alternate viewing fare apart from those willing to subject themselves to such an ordeal for the sake of a couple of chortles. -4/10",Year One

Anyway the weekly trip to the shop used to be how I managed to watch about 1,353,286 movies since the 90s.However this year I have only made about 3 visits to the store, instead watching stuff in the cinema, rewatching my own stuff or borrowing from friends. Only now I have watched most of mine and rifled through everything that my mates own.I know Year One has copped a bake by reviewers as being horrible but Ramis is the guy that made Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters, I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt, (rather than watch my wife's suggestion The Proposal).My verdict is that this is exactly the type of film that would usually end up in my arms at the video shop midwinter, when you couldn't head outside during the day and couldn't be bothered going out at night.Year One is lightweight, hardly memorable and not even very interesting, but dammit it was amusing and kinda likable. I would rather kill 80 minutes watching this than 3 hours watching Transformers 2, regardless of the appeal of Megan Fox in a tank top, and I would rather watch this again on DVD than watch 40 minutes of carefully plotted and scripted ""reality"" TV.As mentioned Year One has a pretty crappy storyline, almost as if the writers thought ""let's make a comedy set in ancient times"" - and decided to rest on their laurels. In fact 99% of the chuckles come not from jokes but from Jack Black and Michael Cera, both of whom play themselves. That means JB is energetic, manic and needlessly loud, and Cera is understated, meek and speaks under his breath half the time. If you thought Black was OK in School of Rock or Cera was funny in Superbad there might be enough for you here, but if you are expecting carefully plotted humour and hilarious setpieces look elsewhere, as Year One has absolutely none of that.The plot makes no sense, but that is simply because it means nothing to the film anyway. Black and Cera play Z and O, a couple of what appear to be ""caveman"" era guys, they spend their days hunting, gathering and trying to impress the cavechickies.They are basically kicked out when O eats the forbidden fruit, why the fruit is forbidden or its significance is never explained. For some reason they run into biblical characters, despite the fact that if the bible is correct there were no cavemen, and if there were they would have existed thousands of years before biblical times. (Take THAT theologians!) Anyway Z and O run into Cain, Abel and end up in the city of Sodom for the second half of the film spending time as slaves. This is largely irrelevant, they learn nothing, achieve little until the very end and just sort of drift through various situations with no real impact.There wasn't one scene that I would say was memorable in any way, aside from an upside down O relieving himself and having it run down his face, which despite the stupidity was actually pretty funny.Now that I've gotten this far in the review I see why most critics are almost unanimous in their derision of the film, but I still thought it was amusing due to the two leads and I actually could find myself watching it again down the line.Year One is harmless in the same vein as countless lightweight comedies of the 80s and 90s, stuff like My Blue Heaven, Men At Work, Three Fugitives and Turner and Hooch. You know, when a comedy was supposed to make you feel good after watching it - not leave you wondering if Little Freddie managed to pick up the venereal disease he so seemed to covet.There's not much reason to celebrate this movie, but I shut off my brain and I had a good time watching it.So sue me.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Brainless, pointless, badly written and actually poorly made, I liked it anyway.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",Year One
41,Pumpkin_Man,Very Funny!!!,10,24 June 2009,"This was an extremely funny movie and had great gags, hilarious references to Biblical history, and much more! Jack Black was incredibly funny as a lazy hunter named Zed, and Michael Cera plays his friend who is a gatherer named Oh. When Zed is caught eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he is banished from the tribe, but Oh decides to join him. They run into Cain and Able, meet Abraham, who is fixing to kill his son Isaac, stop Maya and Eema from becoming slaves, and much more!

42,Sirus_the_Virus,"Dumb, dumb, dumb... occasionally funny but falls flat.",5,6 October 2009,"Jack Black and Michael Cera pull an Adam and Eve in Year one. A film that has everything there. Has all of the right ingredients. A great director, a great cast, and a original plot, if not ridiculous. But there is something about this film that does not work. A big chunk of the supposedly scenes are retarded, and there is one scene involving Oliver Platt that just leaves you with one feeling. Ick. Black and Cera star as Zed and Oh, two village idiots(Ha!)that are caught eating from the Garden of Good and evil. They are kicked out. And they begin a quest to find somewhere else. The film sort of falls apart once they meet Cain and Abel. Literally, the film falls apart for them, and for us too.I'll admit that I laughed a couple of times. But besides that there is nothing very special about Year one. Harold Ramis is a very funny man and he could do a lot better than this. I really wasn't expecting much from Year one. Trust me, you shouldn't. The film isn't a total disaster, it's just gross and at times really dumb. Thumbs down fort Year one.Year one:**/****",Year One
43,Beta_Gallinger,A very unsatisfactory Biblical spoof which wears out long before it's over,4,20 August 2010,"I think I saw the trailer for this 2009 comedy when I was in the theatre a month before its release, and saw that Jack Black played one of the starring roles. The other starring role is played by Michael Cera, and earlier this year, I saw him in ""Juno"", a 2007 blockbuster which I thought was very overrated, but for some reason, I still didn't recognize him while watching this later release. I was obviously in no hurry to see ""Year One"", since it took me over a year to get around to doing so, but with Black in the film, I was bound to watch it eventually. Before finally watching it this month, I could see that it was not a very highly praised comedy adventure, but that didn't mean I definitely wouldn't find any of the gags funny. It didn't seem that bad at first, but soon got worse.Zed and Oh are two members of a prehistoric tribe. Zed is a clumsy hunter and Oh is a timid gatherer. One day, the hunter eats forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and after the entire tribe finds out about this, he is banished. Oh decides to come along with him, and together, they eventually meet Cain and Abel, two brothers who don't get along. Zed and Oh witness Cain killing Abel, and Cain convinces them that they will have to escape with him in order to avoid being accused of killing his brother! During their travels with the murderer, Zed and Oh discover that their tribe has been enslaved, including their romantic interests. Cain betrays the two cavemen and sells them into slavery, but during a Sodomite attack, they manage to escape! They watch the Sodomites for a while, but then fall asleep and wake up the next morning to find that the Sodomites have gotten away with the slaves, so the former tribe hunter and gatherer set out to Sodom to try and save their people.This film starts nicely with some beautiful scenery, and I have to admit, I did find some parts pretty funny around the beginning, including Zed accidentally shooting one of the other hunters with an arrow. However, it isn't long at all before this mild amusement stops, and the rest of the movie is almost completely straight-faced. At one point, not long after Zed and Oh have left their tribe, we come to a memorably lame gross-out gag, which is Zed picking up excrement from the ground and taking a bite out of it for clues! The two protagonists then meet Cain and Abel from the Old Testament, and we see another lame gag, with Cain giving his brother several beatings on the head before finally killing him! After this, ""Year One"" continues to be boring and unfunny, and more notably bad gags are featured, such as Oh upside down urinating on himself. Jack Black can sure be funny, but not so much in this movie, and Michael Cera's performance as Oh is certainly not very impressive. There are other rather poor and unfunny performances here, such as David Cross as Cain, and more so Oliver Platt as the High Priest. This character is responsible for more lameness in the film, in scenes such as the one with Oh massaging the High Priest's hairy chest with oil.Harold Ramis has made some very popular movies in his career, but no wonder this isn't one of them! For a little while around the beginning, I couldn't quite understand all the criticism, but that certainly didn't last. While I can't say I never laughed, overall, ""Year One"" is just another unfunny and juvenile comedy, even if it's set in a different era than most other comedies like this. Sometimes, comedies can be stupid in a good way, but this one is stupid in a bad way. Like the controversial 1979 Monty Python effort, ""Life of Brian"", this 2009 Harold Ramis film is a Biblical spoof, but unlike the earlier film of the two, this one isn't funny. If you're offended by the idea of Biblical spoofs in general, then you should obviously avoid both films, but if you're not and you want to laugh, I recommend the 1979 release (if you're into Monty Python's type of humour), but suggest you skip this poorly crafted dud from last year.",Year One

45,Stampsfightclub,With its stars and director this is one of the biggest upsets in comedy,1,29 July 2009,"After Zed (Black) causes trouble with his tribe, he and O (Cera) go on a journey to explore the world, only to be hindered by the political outbreak in Sodom When looking at the renowned classic comedies of our time a few favourites that still make you chuckle may be Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day and any Pixar film. Comedy genre has certainly hit a slump these last few years with the spoofs reigning supreme including Disaster Movie, Scary Movies and numerous others.So this would apparently be a dig at both sides of the coin. Harold Ramis, star of Ghostbusters and director of the astounding Groundhog Day returns to write and direct this physical comedy about two people who are cast away from their tribe and are forced to find their own way in the unknown world.With the odd exception of Disaster Movie and Agent Cody Banks 2, I have never seen something so grossly unreal, something so sickly physically and a film so obvious and pointless you may find yourself going back to the theatre's desk and demanding a refund.But this is perhaps worse in retrospect as it contains an up and coming teen that has starred in some renowned hits. Michael Cera has dazzled in Superbad and Juno with established comedian and musician Jack Black a legend in America.You will be therefore forgiven for thinking this would be an entertaining look into the stone ages, or Iron Age or when ever it is set as the facts and figures are misjudged by some awful juxtaposition of cavemen and Romans that you really couldn't care less.Initially the tone is set as after a quite reasonable cinematic setting sweep around the land but then the blubbering loud mouth Black hits someone with his spear. Instead of screaming like his victim there is a higher probability you will frown as me and my friend found out as the awful comic hits continued to baffle.From poo eating to gut wrenching chest rubbing this is arguably one of the sickest looks at human nature to ever grace the genre, perhaps even cinema. From these baffling disgusting depictions of human nature there is barely any room to establish a point or motive. The pair seems to be travelling but come across a conveniently placed story involving slavery and killing virgins and slicing men's parts. It really is all over the place and the only comfort is that it has an ending, which as it turns out isn't as bad as the rest of the film, but nevertheless predictable.The pattern of the film tries to follow into too many genres with romance, comedy, drama, action and adventure all attempted but never being justified. Ramis' direction is often mixed with the end fight sequence exceptionally convenient and highly unrealistic.But sadly despite its director and stars this film follows the declining trend of the comedy genre by using disgusting physical humour and a poorly paced script.",Year One
46,jon.h.ochiai,"""Year One"" is a Zero",1,21 June 2009,"""Year One"" is the absolute worst movie of the year. As a comedy, ""Year One"" is not funny. In fact, some of it is so off. ""Year One"" is utter and complete garbage. I walked out the theater after 40 minutes of this insufferable cinematic crap. Harold Ramis directed and wrote ""Year One"" along with Gene Stupritsky and Lee Eisenberg. They all should be ashamed for writing virtually no story at all. Recall that Ramis had directed ""Caddyshack"" and wrote such classics as ""Ghostbusters"". What happened here? Seems like they were all banking on Jack Black's adlib skills to rescue the movie? Bad idea.Here Jack Black and Michael Cera as inept hunter Zed and loser gatherer Oh emblazon themselves as one note performers. Black again plays a fat annoying loud mouth, who is really less appealing when he is not voicing a lovable Kung Fu Panda, who actually had real lines to deliver. For example when he comes up with a lame name for his new tribe, when he is banished from his current one the effect is beyond lame—not funny. Patience for the talented Michael Cera playing yet another sarcastic and ""smarter than thou"" misunderstood loser is really running thin.Granted I did not see all of ""Year One"". Refusing to waste any more time on this piece of trash, I walked out after 40 minutes of the movie, which was probably 30 minutes too late. Misjudging time distinguishes ""Year One"". As described before, Black and Cera play hunter and gatherer pals set on adventure around 1 A.D., or at least we are lead to believe. Two miscalculated gags come to mind that illustrate this train wreck. After leaving their tribe, Zed and Oh befriend Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd). Of course Cain kills Abel as in the Bible. However, this 3 minute scene goes on about 2 minutes and 30 seconds too long, and falls flat. More disturbingly, this comedic sketch lands as so off. It is not funny in the least, and extending the punch-line is torturous. I get the feel that ""Year One"" may have been some vanity project that went horribly wrong. There is another scene where Zed (Black) attempts to have sex with Adam's (Ramis) daughter Lilith (pretty Eden Riegel). However, Lilith explains to Zed that she is a lesbian. Zed is a stupid idiot, but we do not need to have this hammered into our skulls for the duration of this witless exchange. Also why does Black have surfer dude speak as Neolithic hunter-gatherer? I suppose again that was supposed to be funny.""Year One"" is totally without redemption or humorous value. It is a complete and utter waste of time, and a movie that even has less story than the legendary Cheech and Chong movie ""outlines"" of the 1980's. At least those movies were funny. In that vein, one has to wonder if the makers of ""Year One"" were also stoned, thinking that their movie was actually funny. Again, it is not.",Year One
47,ajs-10,Sorry folks... It's not good...,4,8 August 2010,"First of all I must admit I only watched this because Michael Cera is in it. I've liked his work ever since I first saw him in Juno (2007); he has a great future ahead of him, if he chooses his roles wisely. But I digress, here's a little flavour of the plot before I tell you what I really think.Zed and Oh live in a village where Zed is a hunter, not a very good one, and Oh is a gatherer. Both have women they like but never seem to be able to get. One day Zed has had enough of being disrespected and, taking Oh with him, goes into the forest where he eats the fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge. As a result the pair is banished from the village. After much travel they come across two brothers fighting, Cain and Abel I think that's enough of the plot, you can probably see it's going to go downhill from here.Although it's had quite a lot of money spent on it, and there a few well known names in the cast, this one misses the mark by quite a long way. I will say though that the scenes with Michael Cera as Oh were the high points for me. He had all the best lines and delivered them in that dead-pan style of his perfectly. On the other hand, Jack Black as Zed was his usual gross-out self. It seems he can only play comedy in one way and we've all seen it too many times already. As far as the rest of the cast goes, honourable mentions go to Oliver Platt as the High Priest, David Cross as Cain, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Isaac, Vinnie Jones as Sargon, Hank Azaria as Abraham and Juno Temple as Eema.Over all, it's a pretty bad comedy that, if it wasn't for Michael Cera, I would not have bothered to see. I can only hope he chooses better scripts in future. Most definitely NOT recommended unless you're a huge Michael Cera fan.My score: 3.7/10",Year One

49,charlytully,Not your father's Old Testament (PS--Paul Rudd was Abel),6,22 June 2009,"Take a moment now to skip over to the ""Parents' Guide"" section for YEAR ONE, and peruse what a couple of gluttons for punishment have accurately enumerated in terms of parental cautions for this film (keeping in mind that most of these incidents pertain to key figures in what is commonly called the Old Testament of the Bible). Ask yourself, what would happen to the publicly identified cast and crew if these same descriptors were all used in reference to actors posing as and named for the founding figures of Islam (to which the ""Abraham"" character in YEAR ONE is directly antecedent)? Figures such as director Harold Ramis, co-writer Gene Stupnitsky, and acting leads Jack Black, Michael Sera, David Cross and Paul Rudd could only survive by paying security worker wages higher than those of death fatwa-ed author Salman Rushdie. Fortunately for them, artists in the United States have always been able to make the grossest, lewdest, most ribald jokes about all the holy figures of Judaism and Christianity with NO consequences beyond collecting big bucks for their bank accounts from the 90 per cent of Americans who have no meaningful degree of religious reverence. The 10 per cent who are not so accepting of sacrilege know better than to say anything negative, since everyone is aware that the Yankee way to ""let off steam"" is to slander and besmirch anything to do with the majority culture's ancestors and religion, making it less likely that we would ever let slip a remark against outside religions favoring public beheadings, the stoning of sassy females, and the gang-raping of unchaperoned women ""to teach them a lesson."" Therefore, it is YOUR DUTY as an American to pay to see YEAR ONE joke the hell out of Adam, Eve, Seth, Cain, Abel, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and their kin so that when you hear of a religious atrocity somewhere in today's world, you'll be prepared to deflect any bad feeling about it with a good Bible joke!",Year One

52,the-movie-guy,Senseless humor that should have been sacrificed to the blazing inferno,4,17 June 2009,"(Synopsis) In year 1, Zed (Jack Black) and his friend, Oh (Michael Cera), are two inept cavemen just trying to survive. Zed is a lazy hunter with no skills, and Oh is a gatherer of nuts and berries. Zed is banished from the village after he eats the forbidden fruit. Oh decides to go with Zed on his epic journey to the end of the earth. Instead, they both find a new world outside of their prehistoric village. They soon find themselves wandering in Biblical times in Bible country. They met Cain and Abel tending to their herd, and for the first time in their lives they get to ride at a high rate of speed in Abraham's one cow cart. Zed and Oh meet many people in their travels, and along the way, they are sold into slavery and end up in Sodom.(My Comment) The movie has a juvenile sense of humor with every mode of silliness put into the movie the writers could think of. They put sex jokes, bodily fluid jokes, and just bad old jokes in the whole movie. They even put in a blazing inferno scene inside a giant bull's head where they sacrificed virgins to the gods to end the drought and grant them rain. The storyline was very contrived, and the historical connection just left after the first thirty minutes. There were some funny scenes that were hilarious, but they were overtaken by the utter stupidity and gross-out scenes in the rest of the movie. The sexual overtones were overdone and unoriginal. If you like the style of humor of Jack Black, then you will like the movie. Overall the movie is senseless humor with a few gags and laughs.

This, however, did not make me laugh at all. Jack Black was tolerably decent in last year's Tropic Thunder and Michael Cera has recently been popping up in some stuff after he appeared in Superbad. Now you would also think that with Apatow producing it would hit it big, but honestly the jokes wore thin very quickly and I didn't care for it.So if you want to take the chance then see this, if not then don't bother.

It's a story that we've seen before about two buddies trying to find their way in the world. Only this movie doesn't make it clever, heart-warming or funny during the adventure.Jack Black and David Cross are pretty much the only comedians in the movie that actually can make you chuckle. I really wish that Ramis had the opportunity to write this solo, because Ramis has more comedy than the hacks that helped co-write.Aside from the comedy, or lack there of, the movie is mainly a teen romance laced with tons of suggestive sexuality. Juno Temple plays the eye-candy Eema and pretty much the only attraction for male teens to go and see the film. It's a terrible film with absolutely no premise or plot and seems to drag on.

Historically, one would have to accept passing references to modern terms such as ""lesbian,"" ""gay,"" ""dick"" and ""balls"" among other latter-day words we take for granted, but they certainly would not have been around in this film's time-frame.I know I'm reading WAY to much into this, but I also know is that these scenes were ripe for big laughs, but only a few were realized. Instead, the writers felt it necessary to substitute scenes of Jack Black devouring a turd and Cera urinating on himself.I did like the sequence where Zeb and Oh experience riding in a cart for the first time (even though it moved at about one mile an hour); the wagon chase scene (as brief as it was) was also pretty funny. That was it, however.The moronic duo then spends the rest of the film in Sodom (of Sodom and Gamorrah infamy) trying to free a a pair of comely slaves, Maya (June Diane Raphael, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Eema (Juno Temple, ""Notes On a Scandal""). Here, while Black pretends to be ""The Chosen One"" (which is an excuse to overact, no doubt), Cera is presented with his third or fourth homo-erotic situation, this time he's painted bright gold by a fat, bald eunuch and then forced to rub oil on the stomach of a pudgy Oliver Pratt (I'll be losing my lunch now, thank you).I won't write about the dimwitted conclusion or if Zeb and Oh get the girls or not. I won't because by the time the movie ended, I was thoroughly disgusted. Not so much by the constant pee, poop, flatulence and sex jokes that substituted for real comedy, but by the wasted potential of a good cast, writers and a director that's supposed to know from funny.I laughed out loud just a few times, but more often than not, I found myself coming up with jokes and situations that were funnier than what I was seeing (and I'm just not that funny). That, coupled with some sequences that just did not know how to end and the fact that characters were really dying and getting maimed and injured made this one terrible movie and one of the worst ""comedies"" of the year.And, if all of that wasn't enough, the movie ends with the world's most depressing set of outtakes. I didn't need this kind of picture in my life right now and believe me, neither do you.",Year One
65,mrcibubur,funny movie which doesn't make you laugh!,5,7 February 2010,"This is a comedy with the stereo-typed Jack Black whom I think actually is inch perfect for the role he plays in the movie. He cant really act, just performs and that is what he did in this movie, hence his suitability. It is a funny film but not hilarious and wont make your laugh, not like Spy Next Door, but who am I to judge? there isn't really a story line but the majority of folk watching this munching their popcorn with their partners or kids wont change that.acceptable comedy but easy forgotten and not worthy of any awards despite the high quality people involved.could of course have been funnier, I do like to laugh at comedies. concept of the film is actually quite good and if they make a sequel, hope they bear in mind the reviewers remarks.big question marks though about jack black and where he goes from here, Mr Cera certainly has more acting potential but needs to come out of his shell! overall a disappointing movie but kids, teenagers etc will like it, thats the real market for this movie.",Year One
66,Ric-7,Oliver Platt is the only reason to see this,5,24 June 2009,"It's a fairly sad comment that mentioning the scene where Jack Black tastes bear excrement might be considered a ""spoiler."" I found it to be more gross than funny. And Cain killing Abel can hardly be called a spoiler; but that murder scene (no matter how comically acted) made me cringe more than laugh. In general, the film was mildly amusing, evoking smiles a few times, until the appearance of the High Priest Of Sodom (Oliver Platt). And then I actually began to laugh. Why? Maybe it's because Platt was actually portraying a character, rather than just doing his own shtick. Jack Black was just being Jack Black (which can be funny now and then). Ditto Michael Cera.Oliver Platt was in a different class: an actor rather than a comic personality. And he was very very funny. I am thankful he was in the film. Years from now, if I remember this film at all, it will be because of Platt's performance.",Year One
67,RichardSRussell-1,"10,000 BC with Self-Awareness",4,19 June 2009,"Last year's 10,000 BC was an incredible farrago of ecosystems, historical eras, and technologies, all portrayed with a perfectly straight face. We move forward about a hundred centuries (movie years, not real ones) to arrive at Year 1, and about the only progress we've made is that at least nobody takes this stuff seriously.OK, that's faint praise, which is about all Year 1 deserves. Here's the downside: If it's intended as comedy, it's supposed to be funny. Perhaps the director neglected to mention this to the screenwriter. Oh, wait, says here that they're both Harold Ramis. Hmmm, guess we can't chalk it up to failure to communicate, then.Can't blame Jack Black, who gives it his all as Zed, son of Zero. Tho by far the least competent of his tribe's hunters, Zed has an ego the size of Mount Sinai, and danged if his warrantless optimism isn't contagious. At least it has that effect on the gatherer O, son of Oo, in which role Michael Cera essentially reprises his hapless, gawky teenager from Juno. When Zed is banished for partaking of the forbidden fruit (which he's convinced, against all evidence, has gifted him with vast new knowledge), O tags along.They leave behind the 2 pro forma sex objects, Maya and Eema. Not to fear, however, as they will keep popping up again thruout the film.A brief stroll thru the forest and over the mountains ""at the end of the world"" takes about a week in movie time and 50,000 years of anthropological development to a village of herdsmen and farmers, notably including Cain, who repeatedly brains his brother Abel while our heroes back away in trepidation about offending this obviously maniacal murderer. By Biblical chronology, we're now up to about 4004 BC, but shortly thereafter we jump another couple of thousand years to watch Abraham (Hank Azaria, seen just last week as an Egyptian pharaoh) getting set to sacrifice Isaac. They save the kid, who has a dope connection in Sodom and leads Zed and O there, 1 step ahead of his dad's milah. That's where things get stuck for the rest of the movie.There's lots more plot contrivance, and a few chuckles and giggles among the fart and crap jokes, so you've gotta give the writers credit for quantity if not quality. And there are many gratifying (and gratuitous) insults heaped on the heads of religious stupidity and political cupidity, so it's not a dead loss.But it doesn't hang together. For example, early on O is in the clutches of a giant snake and, a few scenes later, gets leapt on by a panther. But each time we cut to him subsequently chatting with Zed, apparently having inexplicably survived the attack. This had the hallmarks of a running joke, but it's just dropped after those 2 incidents. WTF?So we have a bold, clever guy (Zed) and an intelligent, creative one (O) trying to make their way in a testosterone-drenched primitive culture. Coulda done a lot with that! Didn't. Too bad.",Year One
68,colinrgeorge,"""Year One""",5,6 April 2010,"I anticipated another ""Land of the Lost,"" or rather hoped for one, which is to say another silly but misunderstood and critically underrated comedy, but Harold Ramis' ""Year One"" isn't that film. But that's also not to suggest the film doesn't have silliness to spare, but the juvenile jokes, the surface-level period gags, and the flat line story arc prevent the talented cast (Jack Black, Michael Cera, David Cross, Hank Azaria) from elevating the film beyond mediocrity.Like ""The Hangover"" and about as funny, ""Year One"" is its premise. It's maybe a concept comedy on the page, but the constituent scenes more closely resemble sketches than a piece of a whole, and the whole is less than the sum of its parts. There's no build, there's no arc, there's just a sparse minefield of successful one-liners and gags, and dangerous stretches between. The best that can be said is that the comedic personalities play exactly as you would expect between Black and Cera, but the script rarely offers them the opportunity to work together so much as beside one another.The two play Hunter Zed and Gatherer Oh respectively, though the advertised caveman humor lasts all of about twenty minutes before the pair becomes unwittingly entwined in decidedly safe Bible parody. Cue the prostitution and foreskin jokes.The environments are not as interesting as the mashed-up land of the lost, and because Black and Cera play their characters with on the nose modern sensibility, the prehistoric comedy is mostly demoted to an aesthetic gimmick. Many of the best jokes, besides having been in the trailer, do have fun with the premise, but lack the searing wit or intelligent wherewithal to comprise a smart comedy about dumb characters, rather than a lowbrow comedy about large-brow characters, which is what it is.David Cross, who plays antagonist Cain (to Paul Rudd's Abel), has proved himself hilarious time and again through not only his own material and ""Arrested Development,"" but has carved himself some unexpectedly interesting roles from the most awful material (""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" springs to mind), but disappointingly never clicks in ""Year One"" either. The dialogue doesn't offer him the bite he's great at playing with and never sounds quite natural coming from him.The script was maybe a placeholder at some point. With so many proved comedians lined up for the parts, it'd seem a safe bet that the funny would work itself out naturally, and there's evidence of improv throughout, but no one seems able to overcome what's on the page. As also in ""The Hangover,"" the middling final product is a testament to the importance of not just a high joke per minute ratio in comedy writing, but in story. Last summer's ""Tropic Thunder"" had a strong premise that often didn't need to rely on gags because the plot itself was clever.""The Hangover"" attempts the same, but less intelligently and ultimately less successfully. ""Year One"" is a different type of comedy altogether, a straightforward concept mined for all it's worth over an hour and a half.Ramis, who once directed ""Caddyshack"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" has been struggling to strike gold again, and is more recently responsible for the dreadful ""Bedazzled"" and decent ""Analyze This/That"" films. Needless to say, ""Year One"" isn't his return to form. His direction is nondescript and though the actors give it their all, the script was too stagnant from inception to be saved.",Year One

I find it interesting that this is from producer Judd Apatow and director Harold Ramis, who directed the comedy classic Groundhog Day.Starring Jack Black and Michael Cera as gatherers for their tribe. Black and Cera are a little over the top and could have done much more with these characters. There are also appearances by Paul Rudd and David Cross as Cain and Abel. Hank Azaria steals the show in this movie as Abraham. This movie mostly contains Black and Cera running into characters and places from the Bible.Year One contains campy dialogue and campy costumes. This movie felt like it could have been made by a middle school or high school students with a video camera. I know director Harold Ramis and Jack Black are much more talented than this.

This movie is incredibly quotable! Don't pay attention to the poor reviews, this film is up near the same alley as Nacho Libre.

Irrelevant and stupid one liners are thrown in periodically (such as Jack Black making a crack at a wild animal he is eating resembling women's anatomy).The Acting - Again, what was Jack Black thinking?

As expected Jack turned is his normal ""I can't act, I can just do this one personality"" performance. As expected his character is crude, idiotic and believes himself to be a genius Casanova (I dare you to name any character he has played that this does not describe). Micheal Cera whom I am told is an actual actor left me unconvinced. Neither ""character"" managed to be likable or show any character growth throughout the story, not one inch of growth or shred of wisdom. I suppose its too much to ask when both characters have names that mean ""zero"". As with most Jack Black films it claims to be comedy but the jokes are old enough to draw social security benefits and the sight gags won't appeal to anyone over the age of 13 or so. To me the funniest moment of the film is when Zed is getting the snot beaten out of him.

That's a little chant you can soothe your head with if you so happen to go through the misfortune of watching ""Year One."" About as detestable a movie as anyone could imagine, one wonders why Sony decided to screen it for critics to begin with and wonders even more why they couldn't at least show us something afterwards to erase it completely from our memories. It's bad. It's really, really, really bad. It's unimaginable that a worse movie could possibly come out this year. Harold Ramis, the man who directed ""Caddyshack"" and ""Groundhog Day"" for crying out loud; what has happened to you? What did the movie audience do to you to deserve this movie? The only funny thing about it is that a competent person directed it, that people who have been funny before starred in it, and yes, even funny people wrote it.The story centers around tribal nitwits Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera), two guys living in the year one who can neither hunt nor gather and so are thrown out of their community of Neanderthals and dung n' stick huts. No matter. For the two have eaten of the forbidden fruit and are now curious about what lay outside of their limited little world, and so they embark on a journey through the ancient world. On their travels they meet Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), Abraham (Hank Azaria) and Isaac (Christopher-Mintz Plasse), and they wind up in Sodom where their girlfriends (Juno Temple and June Diane Raphael) have been turned into slaves and are about to be sacrificed by the high priest (Oliver Platt). None of this really matters, as it's all just set- up for a lot of bits that are flawlessly unfunny.It's safe to say that Ramis has gone from rusty (his previous directorial effort was 2005's ""The Ice Harvest"") to downright awful. He, along with co-screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (two guys who are part of the creative think tank on ""The Office""), craft a complete train-wreck of a film that falls back on everything that's wrong with American comedy. It settles for lowest common denominator and aims lower. Poop is eaten, a character hanging upside-down pees and lets it trickle down his face, testicles are thrown, genital mutilation is referenced, and fart and vomit jokes are painfully added to this crude and all together embarrassingly sloppy and unfunny stew of crap. And this is the A-material. The movie also tries to riff on the bible as much as possible, hitting on everything from forbidden fruit to slaves to temples of death. It's all just a lot of rambling with no punchlines. Ramis and co. are going for a little bit of Mel Brooks, a little bit of Seinfeld, and a little Monty Python, just they fail miserably at all three. The only thing that comes close to funny and worth referencing is a looney slapstick fight between Cain and Abel that later keeps getting hammered to death through repetition.And Jack Black is just insufferable in this kind of scenario. His brand of comedy is the hyperactive, off-the-rails, take everything to about a level 10 type that's worked well for him in movies like ""School of Rock"" and ""Tropic Thunder"", but with sub par material he is in fact a far below-irritating comic actor who just grates on you in every scene. And Michael Cera is doing his regular dorky hangdog shtick here and that's another problem with the movie in general. These two spend time mugging and doing their own improv, basically being themselves rather than the characters. They're both too modern to actually be believable in these roles. And most of the woman characters are too modern too. One mentions she's a lesbian. Another mentions that God may be a woman. Both seem to center on feministic principles that in year one might get a woman into a lot of trouble. Lastly, as if this movie doesn't try hard enough to work gross, we have to watch a hairy, effeminate Oliver Platt get oil rubbed on him in yet another scene that screams for laughs but only gets more groans.

Bad to no acting, insulting and meaningless plot, boring and not funny at all. This is a brief summary of the movie. Lets start with the characters. Michael Cera who has proved his lack of talent in many movies shows yet another bad performance. He is so boring with his expressionless face. Since he always plays the ultimate looser, we got used to it but come on, enough is enough. Jack Black is playing his usual style. Even if you normally find him funny, I can guarantee you a big disappointment for his character in this movie. Now lets come to the gravest part. I don't know what was their target audience but a script writer can't be that short-sided. I don't think non-religious people can get all the references so they most probably would find the plot unclear and unfunny. The religious people wouldn't find the references funny since what they are trying to make fun of is the fundamentals of the faith of quite a few people.

But then again we are both 20-something young adults still struggling with transitioning into this so-called maturity. And this is the problem with Harold Raims' ""Year One""--it is not friendly to its viewers, violently dumbing-down its subject to straight absurdity. Whether you like it or not depends strictly on your personality. It is not parodying, but ridiculing its subject and itself.So, of course that it gets so ridiculous that it just becomes effortlessly funny. Take the two leading men for instance. Jack Black's physique definitely does not look like anything prehistoric. He looks like an extremist hipster who loves The Offspring, AFI and, oh my God, Rush! Then there is Michael Cera. He is so emasculated--the ultimate loser, his character would pass as an attractive teenage girl even today. Aggressive and exaggerated extremes such as that make this film easy to hate. But that is why I like it. I felt relaxed and entertained at each piece of adventure these boys went through.Sure, as funny as these biblical adventures are, when you put the film together it does not amount to much. The cringe-worthy ending in itself reminded me what type of film this is--the garden variety easy-going entertaining type, yet there is one particular reference that I enjoyed. It is the scene in which Abraham (yes, the biblical one) introduces his people to the two protagonists: ""We are the Hebrews. A righteous people but not very good at sports"". I would've enjoyed to see more of these social satire elements.In the hands of someone more patient and calculated, ""Year One"" could have been one of those classic Mel Brooks style parodies.

I like goofy humor and generally like Jack Black and Michael Cera in things. I liked Mel Brooks' History of the World Part 1. That is what this movie reminded me of a lot. I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD.There is a lot in this movie that does not occur in an appropriate time-line. For example, the whole Garden of Eden at the same time as Cain/Abel/Ceth and Abraham/Isaac and Roman soldiers and Sodom. Wow, this movie makes a poor history class. Bottom line is that anyone who would watch this movie hoping for historical accuracy is going to be VERY disappointed and probably should not have even thought about watching it. Just as in History of the World, where there were roman soldiers stopping a chase to smoke marijuana (historical inaccuracy there), the key is to forget about actual history and instead just be ready to laugh about things.Jack Black is exactly what he has played in most other movies. A wise-cracking idiot who bumbles into trouble. Michael Cera is the same character he usually plays, a hapless shy virgin who just wants to find a girl. They are both good at those characters and the movie uses them both well. Oliver Platt as the High Priest is hilarious! Sure, he says or does some politically incorrect things but if you ignore those (this is a comedy remember), it is funny. In the outtakes, it is funny to watch him crack up Michael Cera. David Cross is one of my favorite comedy actors and his portrayal of Cain is also wonderful.This movie does not break new comedic ground or do anything else special and different beyond being funny and entertaining. Maybe that is different based on some of the other movies I have been watching?

Unfortunately none of that works.This movie is bursting with comedic talent and for some reason it just falls flat on its face, the beginning is kind of funny, where they have their regular home and they could have made that whole movie there and it would have been better, but they go on the ""road"" and it becomes unforgivably dull.Even if you are a hardcore Jack Black fan, I can't in good conscience recommend this mess.",Year One
88,TheFinalAlias,"Mildly fun, but very few big laughs.",5,24 June 2009,"Comedy is a dying genre in America. It seems that the only entries the genre sees these days are either lame 'Animal House' wannabes(yes, including 'Superbad'), a bizarre series of films directed by the despicable Friedberg-Seltzer duo that announce themselves as a parody of a specific genre, and then proceed to make completely unrelated, unfunny 'jokes' that are just references to recent movies, and then there's the never-ending cycle of chick-flick romantic comedies. And people say Hollywood makes too many super-hero films *sheesh*Thus, I went in, despite negative reviews, to see one of the first period-setting(get your mind out of the gutter) comedies in a while. I was disappointed. The film really struggles to figure out what it wants to be: A charmingly non PC biblical send-up, a Flinstones-style caveman comedy based off of the lead's ignorance, or a remake of Mel Brook's 'History of the World: part 1'. The result is a merely tolerable film with fairly likable leads(Jack Black & Michael Cera, pretty much playing themselves)and some good gags, but with no huge laughs to justify plunking down your money.That said, the problems are not necessarily due to the cast, it's due to some very poorly written dialog and a poorly structured chain-of-events. Black & Cera have a decent degree of Laurel & Hardy-style chemistry together, but don't really get to show it off, although their friendship is convincing enough to make this work as a feel-good film. Hank Azaria is also great as Abraham, who delivers the film's funniest sequences, although those sadly occur only towards the beginning of the film. The sets are also quite good. Oliver Platt is also amusing as a hypocritical high-priest, but a scene where he has Cera's character lather him in oil is merely groan-inducing when it was obviously intended to be funny. David Cross's portrayal of the biblical Cain(?????Ah, well, it's not like this is supposed to be a history/theology lesson)is obnoxious and overbearing, but fails to be funny. The backstabbing nature of his character doesn't help, either.So, other than some amusing scenes and one laugh-out-loud hilarious moment in a dungeon where Cera's character is chained upside down while he has to pee, the film is fairly forgettable. That said, it does succeed as a feel-good flick, and is more than watchable, but don't expect any big laughs. Go in depressed, or drunk, in one of those moods where anything seems funny, and you'll enjoy it. If the humor had been a little more crude, and perhaps if the film had been animated, then maybe it would have worked.Hey, wait a minute... animated, two-lead characters, opportunities for biblical satire and missed chances for toilet humor? Wait 4-5 years, maybe Trey Parker & Matt Stone can remake this after they are done with 'South Park' and make it funnier. If Hollywood's gotta remake everything, why not this?Oh, and it was still better than 'Passion of the Christ'. And 'Disaster Movie'.~",Year One

90,bramb600,"Not the most amazing comedy ever, but it provides chuckles.",6,20 June 2009,"So, today I went to see the new Harold Ramis biblical comedy, Year One. Now I was very skeptical about this movie because the trailers were hardly impressive and the movie wasn't really all that impressive either. It can not be called a ground breaking comedy but you can certainly get chuckles out of it.Yes it has horrible reviews, but it still has to be the best movie I've ever seen to have a 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. So, if you go in with very low expectations, you'll certainly have a good enough time. Don't expect such great things or you will surely be disappointed.I have to comment on the sets, which were very elaborate. Every scene looked like it would have been expensive to make the scenery and it really pays off, because you will feel like you're in the Year One.Of course I feel that Michael Cera stole the show, but the supporting cast was amusing as well.There was quite a bit of humor, but nothing of the caliber of Monty Python or Harold Ramis. The theater reaction was a lot better too, pretty big laughs throughout and with the shock value. I'll give it a 6.5, since IMDb Ratings don't let me do that, it will be a 7.",Year One

I'd could've just watched Jack Black and Michael Cera bantering back and forth for 2 hours, running into locals. I wish the majority of the movie was just them existing in Sodom.

Both Jack Black and Michael Cera are capable of greatness, but here the material is for far beneath them that they are unable to do anything. Not even David Cross and Hank Azaria are funny. How did director Harold Ramis, who has given us classics like ""Groundhog Day"" in the past, stumble this badly? And with the writers of ""The Office"", no less?

With the amount of comments already written for this movie my little review will probably never be read, but if your in the right mood and sit down to watch this not expecting much then you will enjoy it. I don't know why but it reminded me of Carry On Columbus, maybe because I also didn't think it was great but still found something to laugh at (unlike all the Carry On fans who expected a lot more).The score of about 5/10 here on IMDb is about right, its never going to be in anyones top 10 movies of all time but its also never going to end up in the IMDb all time bottom 250 movies.

However I was slightly disappointed. I wouldn't go so far as to say the only/majority funny parts were in the trailer, but I will say that it had it's troubles.As if it needed to be said - one should not go into this movie with any seriousness. As the movie takes place in a matter of days with two cavemen who wander out and end up in the mythology of Sodoma & Gamora (excuse the spelling). The movie pulls many of it's hijinks from the bible and actually does it really well, the only problem however is the laughs seem to be very stuttered/influent.I sometimes felt myself becoming a bit inattentive as I watched because the laughs simply weren't coming often enough. That's not to say it doesn't have tons of funny parts (because it really does, no matter what anyone says), it's just that the funny parts have a bit of dry parts going about it.I think many people will be drawn to this movie by the two stars. Jack Black and Michael Cera. They actually do portray their common characters to a T.

A few of the jokes/gags had me in tears but they only made up about 10 minutes of the film! Were this film does slightly redeem itself though is the fact that it's quite fun to watch as a little silly adventure movie , the comedy seems to fall at the wayside in this one.Well worth seeing as it's enjoyable and has a few good laughs not the comedic gem we were hoping for from these two but none the less a fair comedy effort Final Verdict: 6/10",Year One

A lot of PG-13 comedies are too cheesy and childish since they can't curse or go to the same limits you can in an R-rated movie, but Jack Black and Michael Cera's performances make you forget you're even watching a movie for 13 year olds. They were cast perfectly, their differences in personality compliment each other very well. Appearances from Paul Rudd and David Cross were especially hilarious, spinning the biblical tale of Cain and Abel in the funniest way possible.

This one made me laugh from Jack Black's spear in the back of a fellow hunter to Michael Cera's droll quips to the beautiful women to the religious insanity.I couldn't believe the stupid body part jokes, even when they hinted they were about to show us, showed us (gross!) and then made sly comments about it afterwards.The script was tight. It kept the comedy rolling as the pair walk through the first thousand years of Biblical history. And it is witty.Being something of a caveman myself, I totally identified with sensitive intellectuals trying to impress the prettiest girls in school, oops, I meant tribe.I love movies. Mostly action/adventure and dramas though. I am not so much a comedy movie nut, though I like live stand-up shows. I did not enjoy Sasha Boren Cohen, a Jew, making crude fun of Arabs in Borat (two naked men grappling on a bed is not amusing to me). Yet I did smile at his sly put-down of American ignorance.I am with Oscar Wilde and ex-Minnesota governor Jess Ventura on this: religion is the opiate of the masses. Those who can not laugh at themselveswell, they must lead very long lives.So I love Mel Brooks' History of the World Part One, for example, when Abraham drops God's 15, oops, 10 Commandants. And when Madeline Kahn picks lovers from a line of slaves: ""no, no, no, yes, no, no, yes, no, no, yes!"" I loved Will Smith with the King of Queens star Kevin James in Hitch. The paring of Black and Cera however, may be one of the best comedy duos that I can think of. I will gladly watch another flick by this writing/acting group. Year One is another feather in Harold Ramis' cap. One can only hope that yet another Ghostbusters, coming soon, has as much to offer.Year One might be worth 8-9 dollars to see it in the theater, it is that good.

106,movieguysla,One and Done,3,5 October 2009,"""Year One"" is not very funny, and I hope putting a number in the title doesn't presuppose sequels. This story of two caveman misfits trying to fit in, explore the new world and save their loved ones occasionally encounters a funny situation, but mostly relies on cheap, cheap gags to get its laughs, rarely succeeding. What do you need? Poop? Pee? Vomit? Circumcision? It's all here, and it's all lame. You can drive a wooly mammoth through some of the dead zones at the end of scenes here that don't work.Especially disappointing in the cavalcade of talent not measuring up: - Jack Black. He's given standard schtick to do, and it's a shame that a comic talent like him can have a performance described as ""standard schtick"". - Michael Cera. It can also be argued that Cera is doing his ""same old routine"" here, too. But his routine usually hits big, and it's just not successful surrounded by bawdy slapstick. He's meant for more heady fare. - David Cross. His opening scene is an example of why most scenes in this film fail. He plays Cain and he, as the Bible story goes, killed his brother Abel. Make a joke and move on. But the film lingers on this scene too long, doing a weak ""I'm not dead yet"" riff and sucking the life out of the comedy. He also comes back to the film too often, dispelling the energy he originally brought, almost as if the film's idea was to have a lot of David Cross around, when the idea should be to have a great character in the film and let's get a good character actor to play the part. You want Cross? Don't miss ""Arrested Development"". - Harold Ramis. How come Ramis hasn't made good on the promise of ""Groundhog Day""? That film signaled his arrival. Even after helming two legendary comic masterpieces in ""Caddyshack"" and ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", it wasn't until ""Groundhog Day"" that Ramis really went A-list. There was a lot more than laughs in ""Groundhog Day"", there was romance, there were life lessons, consequences, relationships and Ramis handled it with panache. Outside of ""Analyze This"", he hasn't capitalized on his then new-found status. In ""Year One"", he shot for Mel Brooks glory, but landed somewhere below ""Dead and Loving It"". - Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg, the writers of ""Year One"". Bad news for those excited about ""Ghostbusters 3"". Meet its screenwritersComing out looking good in all this is Hank Azaria. His turn as Abraham, although saddled with dick jokes that are funny at first, but unfold much slower than the viewer's attention needs them to, is good. His commitment to character enlivens the scenes he is in. Combined with his great Jeremy Irons impersonation in ""Night at the Museum 2"", he's got some of the best comic performances of the summer, in two of the worst films.",Year One

Once he made the wonderful Groundhog Day and participated in the very funny Ghostbusters movies. Year One is neither wonderful nor funny. There are hardly any good jokes, there is way too much useless violence and there's no meaningfull story to be found. Jack Black is only rude and never funny.

I was so upset when I saw how this movie bombed in the theater and just got it from the library yesterday and watched it....and am I glad I saw it for free. A lot of it just wasn't funny or was stuff that we have seen in other movies before. Another thing that bothered me was Michael Cera. He was GREAT in Superbad, but he plays the SAME character in every movie. We get it, he's very good at being awkward, but show us a different character.

109,ForCenturies,"Just a bigger-budgeted and *slightly* better quality version of ""Meet The Spartans"". The only comedy that made me depressed walking out of the cinema.",4,23 June 2009,"I saw this last night with my brother. I was looking forward to it. I had read quite a few reviews demeaning the toilet humour, so I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't know it would be this.Now, I'm all for toilet humour, but when you have Jack Black (the hilarious Tenacious D Pick of Destiny comes to mind), Michael Cera (has some of the best lines in the film) and Harold Ramis (HAROLD RAMIS!) you don't expect, necessarily, to see someone eating poo and someone pissing on himself. The only funny bit about either of those was Michael Cera, who is upside down (for no explained reason) needs to go to the toilet and urinates on his head, but keeps the whole thing going that his hair smells like urine. The punchline was funnier than the actual punch. But, when you have toilet humour, do it well and creatively. Look to a scene in Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make A Porno for a hilarious poop scene that is actually funny.The editing was the thing that hurt this. Things weren't explained, the snake at the beginning of the film continually kept changing positions miraculously, when they were in danger, it cuts to the next scene and they're fine. There was no fluidity to it at all.Characters were written horribly. Michael Cera and Jack Black are a great duo, but the script doesn't help. If they were put in another, funnier, film, I'd see it for sure, they bounce off well, I think. But the character motivations, king's adviser in Sodom puts the crown on, then puts it down and runs away.What? Cain kills his brother, keeps ratting Zed and Oh out and then keeps helping them and then keeps ratting them out.What? David Cross is wholly unlikeable in this. I absolutely hated his portrayal of Cain and every single joke of his was not funny. I'm sitting going ""And you're a comedian?"" because he wasn't making me laugh. Paul Rudd, who plays Able, got more laughs from me than Cain who is in the whole film, unfortunately, and Able is a serious character who never makes a joke.See what I mean? Again, I don't mind toilet humour, but jokes like ""I want you to enter the Holy of Holies"" and ""I want you to sit of the Poly of Polies"" works because of the Holy Temple and the sexual connotations it revolves around, but unfortunately, they beat that to death in the trailers, so there is no laughs.Everyone in my theatre laughed at different things, even my brother and I laughed at different things which tells me they never really settled on a specific demographic for the film, which seems logical to me as this is a toilet-humour centric Biblical epic. It's like trying to make apple juice out of oranges, it never worked.The good things: Oliver Platt was fantastic. They could make a film all about his character and it would be a reprieve for the filmmakers as Oliver completely and utterly had fun portraying the High Priest. His accent was hilarious and I love his line ""I see a happy face, and that makes me happy!"" Another good thing was Olivia Wilde, she was beautiful as the queen of Sodom, and has a great British accent. And keep your eyes peeled (if you see this) for Kyle Gass, the significant (I don't say that lightly) other of Tenacious D as a creepy eunuch. So not all is lost in this fire.It was all over the place, everything, the characters, the writing, the plot (if there was one) everything. This was a true attraction only because of the name star power. It wasn't well thought out film at all, and an hour into it I truly believed this was a bigger-budgeted and SLIGHTLY better version of the horrifically ridiculous ""Meet The Spartans"", it's in that style, but somehow better quality. If this is a sign of things to come for Ghostbusters 3, we're going to be in trouble. I sincerely hope it isn't.All in all, there is an audience for this. A thin audience - either Jewish people - as a lot of this film is Jew-centric - or religious fourteen year olds. I am neither of those. I truly and utterly wanted to like this film having moderately high expectations despite the toilet humour news, but coming out of the cinema, I felt let down and as if I had found a girl at a party, made sexy-time, woke up the next morning and she'd gone. I'd felt used and I paid $10 to get used.Just know what you're getting into, but, like me, that might not help at all.",Year One

It is simply a terrible movie. There's no pros to counterset the cons, as there are none.The plot (if you can call it that) revolves around Michael Cera and Jack Black as midevil cavemen in (well I think that's pretty obvious) and something about getting involved with a Princess, some eunics, some orgy where Cera has to rub oil over a hairy eunic, and lots of jokes about castration (none of which are funny). Actually, the only thing that is funny about this movie is that it was made at all (and that apparently they thought it actually was). This is a grave disappointment for me, since it was from a good director (Ramis, who made the great Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters) and includes the talents of Jack Black and Michael Cera. But in here, the entire cast is wasted, even Olivia Wilde, who's great in ""House"".""Year One"" is worse than ""Dance Flick"" and ""Paul Blart, Mall Cop"", if you can believe that, and will probably retain that spot at the end of the year as well.

112,Sabrz,Better Then I Expected,8,20 June 2009,I have to admit that going to the drive in to watch Year One that I did not have high expectations for the film. Having seen the trailer I didn't think the film would be that funny or well put together. I am happy to say that it turns out I was wrong.Year One follows 2 hunter gathers Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) who have been banished from their tribe. Zed is convinced destiny has plans for him. They wander early in the film coming in contact with many characters from the Bible. Both Zed and Oh are trying to get the girls of their dreams to like them. Eventually they try to rescue them from slavery. The efforts of Zed and Oh are what the movie follows with great comedy.The movie has great acts of comedy and will surprise you into laughing. Year One pokes fun at many characters from the Bible and do it in an outrageous manner. The film itself has many moments of comedy and some parts are disgusting yet hilarious at the same time.Overall it is a good comedy film and I would suggest you watch it. It will make you laugh.,Year One

114,darth-tobe,Too few clever bits buried under a lot of junk,3,12 July 2017,"This is only the second Jack Black film I've watched apart from School of Rock, which I liked a lot. I wonder which film is more typical of a ""Jack-Black film"". I hope it's not this one.Jack Black plays a particularly unlikable version of his slob with big ambitions role that came across to me as a bumbling jerk. The plot follows him and his cliché geek side-kick on a journey through old testament times that is more than a little reminiscent of Life of Brian. In fact, I got the impression that this film really wants to be Life of Brian with its own brand of reluctant chosen one and even some very similar individual scenes. But Life of Brian was absurd, yet sharp-witted, had excellent timing, black humour and a degree of self-awareness that still did not require it to roll its eyes at the camera. Year One has only a few clever moments. I liked the role of Olivia Wilde as the scheming princess and also the way politics played out at the king's court. But that is more the stuff of a serious movie.Year One is supposed to be a comedy. To quote my favourite reviewer: a comedy has to be judged by whether or not it made you laugh. And again there were a few moments that made me smile like when the two main guys make some iconic biblical scenes happen by bumbling into them. Sadly, it seems for each of these moments there is at least one crude one that drags on to the point where it's not funny any longer or way beyond cringe-worthy. Pee jokes and poop jokes and fart jokes and some middle school level sexual innuendo are drawn out as if the director was trying to ensure that even the dimmest of dim-wits could not miss the point the movie was trying to make. It's as if someone was screaming in your face: ""Get it? This right here is supposed to be funny. Have you got it yet? Have you?!""What I found shocking is that with a slightly different cast you could dismiss a lot of this as an ""Adam Sandler movie"" but maybe others are picking up this style. I think it goes to show the kind of opinion studios have of their target audience. I honestly don't know who I would recommend this kind of film to. Best not recommend it to anyone.",Year One

Oliver Platt as a hairy-chested high priest? The ""McLovin"" Kid? There's even a member of Upright Citizens Brigade who puts in a very brief cameo. The story is dumb, and there's a few jokes that fall flat...but the sets are impressive and everyone involved seems to be having fun. A good rental, at least. But you people that are rating it a 1?

But, unfortunately, here it doesn't work quite well :-/ It is ""quite"" finny, sometimes, but more than funny J.B. there is funny ""story"" (or how I may call it ...) I like jokes from biblical stories, 'cos it's very nice to see how people are laughing about classical Old Testaments stories. Unfortunately that is all that is funny to me here. Maybe I am a little perfectionist here, but I think if I want to laugh, be happy or just I want to like comedy movie at all, I need more ""zuckerism"" in it, more parody.

For those of you who don't know what the movie is about, to make it short, it took events from the scriptures and turned it around as a joke, and included their own content that wasn't present in the bible.
People who take things literally and seriously, won't have such a positive experience watching the film. I looked past and viewed the whole movie as a joke, which was it's purpose in the first place. The only thing I will not take as a joke is mocking God, which is present in the film. I don't let it ruin the whole movie for me, however.

With Year one this simply isn't the case and I was utterly disappointed. The movie tries I think to be a mixture of Mel Brooks' History of the World (Part 1) and some mishmash of Monty Python's Life of Brian, but fails on every level. The script was written by a 3 year old but in fact that's probably doing 3 year olds a dis-service.The plot is boring and predictable and even the gags of Black and the dead pan Cera cannot save this deplorable excuse of a movie.I am annoyed (you might tell) that a. I wasted 2 hours watching this drivel and b. because there are so many better more worthwhile things someone could have spent the undoubted millions this movie cost to make on.I can honestly say I laughed 4 times throughout the whole movie and that was when the credits were rolling and the outtakes were being played.Avoid this movie at all costs.",Year One

And I know everyone in the theater was laughing throughout it.There are parts that try to drag a joke out for a little too long, but overall, I thought the humor was simple, effective, and very well executed.Michael Cera was definitely the shining star in this movie.

124,beflin,"Good lines, should be longer",8,25 October 2009,"Script: 9 out of 10. The lines and gags were clever and unexpected. They were not all fart, pee, or poop jokes. But, I felt the lines kind of rambled on as silly narrative from the Oh and Zed characters - which I certainly do find humorous, but is better suited to a Christopher Guest mockumentary.Actually, my score of 9 for the writing includes the deleted scenes an alternate ending. Those deleted scenes and alternate endings raised the average. Without them, the script is really about an 8.I agree with Director Harold Ramis's opinion that he wanted an alternate ending which shows empowerment by the Sodomites, rather than an act of God saving them. However, I disagree with his opinion in the audio commentary that the alternate ending (which features the destruction of Sodom) to be darker or more cynical than the theatrical ending. Dramatically, I thought the deleted scenes and alternate scenes were either better or would have filled in some very minor continuity problems in the theatrical ending.Set: 10 out of 10.Costumes: 10 out of 10.Clearly, a lot of work went into both the set and costumes.Movie length: 6 out of 10. Storyline should have returned to their original village. I suppose this belongs under the script category.For reference: I saw this movie (so far) only on DVD, not in the theater, including all the special features.I still recommend this movie.

I Normally don't say this about comedy movies too much but i feel that this movie probably stretched 20 minutes longer than it should've.

Usually I don't appreciate Monthy Python kind of humour, but in this movie it works for me....I'm just after my wise tooth operation, and it hurts even to smile....and it is hurting a LOT during this movie:D. It is true, not the kind of comedy I would put among the top 10 of all times, for me it should be more complex (good concept, great acting, good laugh). But true, there is the Austin Powers effect: just go with it....and enjoy. I remember watching that movie (Austin) with my ex- boyfriend, I thought he would enjoy it (as he IS a guy, guy kinda simple humour:) sometimes grotesque....and nooo, he hated it:) whenever I see little-me, and the evil, I wanna laugh....and I love the whole parody concept there.

Boy was I wrong. I thought this film would be a parody off of Christianity and the bible.The film does makes some minor jokes towards the bible which weren't really all that funny. As a matter of fact this movie was hardly funny at all, if anything it was just annoying. The characters have no real motivations and they do stupid and annoying things that make you pray for the film to hurry up and end. I really felt as if I just wasted an hour and thirty minutes of my life. Again I say I cant even explain to you what happens because nothing does happen.

136,ValleyOfScarletFever,We were almost the only ones in the theater. Seriously.,3,23 June 2009,"I counted by the end maybe five to ten other people in the movie theater. We were in the back row and we talked for almost the entire movie and nobody minded or got mad. I think a few people walked out. This movie in one word was: BAD.Why did I give this movie a 3 out of 10 and not a one or even a zero? Because I didn't see it alone. I saw it with friends in a matinée early in the afternoon in the back row of a movie theater that new the movie would be bad but laughed at all the lame jokes anyway and threw popcorn at the screen at some points.To be truthful, the movie was awful. AWWWWWFUL. Boo kind of awful. Had I rented it or seen it with adults and no friends I would have hated it and probably wouldn't have recommended it. At all. Ever. Now, this is the second time I've seen a bad movie with friends that's a comedy on purpose; the first was ""Superhero Movie"", which I saw for my birthday. Now, we all knew the movie was awful, but because we were with friends that were stupid teenagers we didn't care. That's what you do; you see bad and ridiculous comedies with friends. But this time there was a breaking point.Now I don't want to make ""Superhero Movie"" sound good by any standards, (it's not people, unless you enjoy fart jokes) but it was decent enough to have good laughs that were actually kind of clever and occasionally some acting that wasn't atrocious. It was still bad, but it had it's points of normalcy. (Sort of.) ""Year One"" didn't. Reasons why ""Year One"" was so bad and everyone agrees? 1. Too long. Even my friend who I was sitting next to the whole time thought the movie dragged on for forever. When I checked my phone (yeah, my phone was on the whole time, I didn't care if it rang, if you were stupid enough to see the movie anyway you don't deserve to see it without a phone on, but it still never rang, anyway), back to the subject, the movie was almost two hours long. TWO HOURS OF PAIN.2. The Bible stories were out of left field. You know, the Cain and Able thing could have been pulled off, but it didn't. It was overacted and it was hit over your head that one was Cain and the other was Able. Although I have to admit, the death scene (over and over again) was pretty funny, but still over acted. Same with when later Cain is accused by his father of killing Able, his reaction was funny, but completely over acted. That bothered me. Sodom and Gommorah were a bit too much of the movie, and Abraham's sacrifice was a bit strange to come at the same time of Cain and Able. It didn't make sense.3. Jack Black was waaaaay too manic, but you could never hear Michael Cera. In my opinion Michael Cera's acting was subtle and funnier than Jack Black's, but many of his jokes didn't work because of how quite he is. (Not to mention he plays the same character in every movie, similar to Black.) 4. The virgin jokes and gay jokes were overdone. Seriously, how many times did we need to be reminded that Michael Cera's character was a virgin and the priest was gay? It didn't make me laugh and it was overdone. Most people can agree with that sentiment.There was so many other flaws, but because I was with friends it was bearable. The final act with the fire and sacrificing came out of left-field, and by then I just wanted to leave.My conclusion? Skip it unless you're willing to dumb yourself down for a day. It's bad. Very bad.",Year One

Other than those, none of the jokes brought anything new to the table. None of the characters were likable and it went on 1 1/2 hours too long.

I might have expected at least some pithy and quotable dialogue, a la Judd Apatow (who produces), but alas, I can't remember a single phrase from this film. The jokes are stale (foreskin humor! Jews being bad athletes!) and the scenes are poorly edited. Some scenes don't even resolve themselves before moving on to the next. An early scene involving Michael Cera and a snake cuts to the next scene without any explanation as to what became of either.

The worst part of this mess is Harold Ramis who did Animal House, Ghostbusters and Caddyshack. Yes, those movies are classic. This movie is not.

In fact, we see a lot of such creatures rating this movie with one star as a political/religious statement. However, if you like your comedy layered upon multiple levels of meaning, and embedded within a historical and philosophical context, and you're knowledgeable enough to get jokes based upon middle eastern mythology and the slow ascent of enlightenment, you will love this movie.The film starts with our Main Men, Oh and Zed (Cera and Black) embedded in a basic hunter-gatherer culture. Only problem is, Oh and Zed are modern humans, with our self-awareness and ironic detachment, surrounded by wild-state humans. The natural humans are powerful and fit, but a little lacking in philosophy.After a close encounter with the Tree of Knowledge, Zed and Oh are exiled by their close-minded band and strike out for the Big City and Modern Times. They soon encounter the Hebrews, and this is where our own closed-minded theatre-goers get their panties in a bunch. We meet Abraham preparing to sacrifice Isaac, Cain slaying Abel, and the ridiculous absurdity of Old Testament ""morality"". Modern day fundies have a sense of humor chiseled in stone like the Ten Commandments, and this movie breaks them all.Unfortunately the innocence of the hunter-gatherers has also been lost by this time. They have been captured by civilization and sold into slavery, and now Zed and Oh have a mission: rescue their damsels in distress (Maya and Eema) from slavery in Sodom.Fortunately Isaac (in a hilarious portrayal of the Jewish Badboy by Chris Mintz-Plasse - that's McLovin to you)guides them to Sin City, where our heroes are quickly introduced into the complexities of modern politics. The power structure of the city is tyrannical and corrupt, ruled by a rotten king, his hilariously corrupt High Priest, and the scheming Prime Minister.By the end of the film Oh and Zed and Maya and Eema (who are also very funny in supporting roles) have traversed the philosophical arc from instinctive animals through corrupt theocracy and finally end up peering through the keyhole of enlightenment.

151,Cornelius_Sneed,Not for everyone...,6,3 January 2012,"But, of course, the same can be said of most Jack Black movies. This one, however, seems to require a viewer who is familiar with the Bible, but who doesn't take it as, well, gospel.If you don't know the Bible at all, you will have no idea who many of the characters are in the first couple of acts, the script will seem disjointed and meandering, and the jokes mostly limited to humor of a puerile and scatological nature. (Which will probably cause you to dismiss it as a ""typical"" Jack Black movie. If so, this is a shame.)If you do know the Bible, you will get the jokes, but if you believe in the Bible, you may be offended by what you might think of as blasphemy. Jack Black's character taking the role of the ""angel"" who stops Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, for example.As I write this, there is one item on the goofs page listed as an anachronism. It mentions Cain wearing rubber boots, blah, blah, blah. I think it is pointless to mention such things, as this whole movie is an anachronism, which seems to be kind of the idea. Zed and Oh leave their caveman tribe, run into Cain and Abel. Cain kills Abel,then takes them home to meet Adam,Eve, and a whole bunch of other people. (who didn't yet exist in the Bible's time-line.) Zed and Oh then move on, and encounter Abraham and Isaac. Next they go to the city of Sodom... And so on. These people and places did not exist at even nearly the same time, according to the Bible. Oh, and the swords of the more militant people they encounter are apparently made of steel, though the movie is set first in the stone age, then in the bronze. Rubber boots are the least of the anachronisms, and were undoubtedly thrown in on purpose, with the movie makers giggling inanely.

I am sure you can do anything else with your time, instead of watching this movie.",Year One
153,Randy-3,Waste of talent and time,2,17 June 2009,"A great number of talented people were involved with this film: writer/director Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day), co-writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (The Office), lead actors Jack Black and Michael Cera, supporting actors David Cross and Oliver Platt, and cameo actors Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, and Kyle Gass, just to name a few. And it was produced by Judd Apatow. And yet it goes so terribly wrong. How? You have to go to the source: the script, which is aimless, disjointed, and sadly puerile. If you enjoy unfunny penis jokes and find the digestion of human excrement absolutely hilarious, you might enjoy this movie. I found very few laughs here, and I can't believe the amount of talent squandered on this trainwreck.",Year One
154,cubalibre1,Whats so funny?,1,1 January 2010,"The first reaction is that of utter disbelief. Could Harold Ramis, who once directed side-splittingly funny movies like Groundhog Day (1993) and Analyze This (1999), be responsible for such dross as Year One? If this raucous d biblical romp rep resents the future m of Hollywood comi edy, it's perhaps time to consider outsourcing the genre someplace where they still value wit, sophisti cation and hearty laughter.Throwing good taste by the wayside, Ramis lampoons ancient religious tenets and mankind's perennial hankering for a messiah. Jack Black and Michael Cera play cavemen buddies who are banished from their tribe for recurring misdemeanours.Wandering the desert the duo steps into history. They encounter various biblical figures from Cain and Abel to Abraham and Isaac. Forget about guffaw-out-loud moments; viewers are more likely to feel the pain of anguish at the dimwits' shenanigans in the city of Sodom.Besides the dire shortage of chuckles, the screenplay brims with sexual innuendo and smutty situations. The talented Jack Black hardly seems to be in form, almost as if he wasn't convinced about his role. In the event, Michael Cera steals the show as the nebbish friend who can't fend for himself.In the supporting role of the hairy high priest, veteran character actor Oliver Platt hits a career low point. As for the women on the scene, they look and behave as if they were in urgent need of acting lessons. Even the end credits outtakes are humourless.In a word, avoid.

This is a textbook case of a film's funniest moments being shown in the trailer, the juvenile, brainless toilet humor (literally as in one scene where Jack Black's character eats a piece of bear crap) proved to be flat and boring. I was in a theater with a majority of junior high students (who seemed to be the target audience for this film) and the theater was silent throughout the first 35 minutes of the film. There was no chemistry between the characters, the ""funny"" moments felt awkward and forced and completely unoriginal. Michael Cera's character had a few mildly amusing lines, but Jack Black's usually oafish, raunchy wit seemed to not blend well at all with his character. The direction was very poor in what could have been a good summer comedy. I left the film after the first 40 or so minutes after an austin power's influenced Cain and Able scene. Don't waste your time with this one folks.",Year One

This is just a review from a movie fan stating his opinion on a website. I won't give you the names of actors, and what roles they've been in, or who directed this, because that stuff is on the info page you just saw, and that kind of redundancy doesn't make anyone some kind of movie critic, despite what so many reviewers think of themselves.I'm not a Jack Black fan but this movie is funny regardless. I'm not sure if a lot of people just find biblical satire offensive or if people are taking the movie too seriously and picking apart its accuracy, but whatever the case there were tons of characters in this movie that had me cracking up, and that even included Jack Black at times.As I expect from just about any comedy these days, there are things I can do without, such as the eating poop and peeing on one's self which have been mentioned ad nauseum here. I used to detest those but now just have come to accept that those things will get into these kinds of comedies so they can reach the part of the audience that finds it funny. It might have made me rate it higher had those been left out, but I still had a lot of laughs from the biblical satire. I loved the characters of Abraham, Cain and Abel, and the witch doctor guy at the beginning.Overall it's an entertaining way to spend your time. Heck I'd watch it again....",Year One

158,TheAtomicPunk,Smart hilarious comedy,8,11 October 2009,"I found this movie on the bottom rack of the corner shelf at blockbuster, which didn't bode well, but I'm glad I took a chance. If you like Arrested Development or Mr Show, you'll like this movie.The movie is a satire of the old testament. It presents the biblical creation story in the context of a tribe of stone age humans with contemporary mindsets. The results are hilarious, it's not as good as Monty Python's Life of Brian, but it's in the same ballpark.The only area where the movie suffers is in what seems like an attempt to cater to a younger audience with toilet humor. However, as you cringe watching the toilet humor scenes, you get sideswiped by a few clever jokes that are timed just right.There are a few jokes in the movie that are delivered so perfectly, with such great nuance and skill, that just thinking about them still makes me laugh. My favorite is the scene where the priest is reading the omens from the sheep entrails he's just poured onto the table, ""to me, I see a smiley face, and that makes me happy"". ;) This movie is one of the few that I'm willing to buy.",Year One
159,TanorFaux,Michael Cera & Jack Black Gem,8,20 June 2021,"This is based on the DVD/BluRay Unrated version of the movie.When I watched the film, I had the DVD commentary version when I was streaming it. Usually I'll watch commentaries after watching the main movie, but with Jack Black, Michael Cera, and the director commentating on the movie, made it so much better to watch.The three of them have such good chemistry to make a film more interesting, if you like watching commentaries. It's just funny hearing them going over how ridiculous this movie was and you know it's not supposed to be a serious flick at all, and it's everyone just having fun you know.It's like a college reenactment party, mixed with the pacing of Sid Meier's Civilization, because you start with the beginning, Hunter/Gatherer tribes, and it's fast forwarding through historical events and your primitives evolve into pseudo-greco/roman civilizations within a day of play.I'm kind of a fan of Michael Cera and Jack Black. Sometimes they alone have good movies, Cera's sort of a soft-spoken actor and he brings sort of the down-to-earth, sort of literal-rationalist taking of the insanity of everyone else, especially with how irrational the plot of the bible is like. Jack Black's just naturally crazy at every role he does, but he's enjoyable enough here. I watched Nacho Libre a few days ago, and watching this movie, I'm still seeing Jack Black be himself, and that's just fine.If I wasn't watching the movie stuck with the commentary version, I'd probably rate this lower to about 5 or 6, it's a terrible movie on its own, like if you removed Michael Cera & Jack Black, the movie wouldn't lose any plot or gain any sense, but it's not trying to be a serious movie. It's like a frat party movie, but set in biblical/roman/early human times. Just something to snack and enjoy, and laugh a bit. And I regularly enjoyed myself, even though it was more like watching it with the lead roles and the director in my living room.",Year One

The first half of the movie was not funny, and when it finally did get funny the movie was almost over.Jack Black is sometimes painful to watch, but Michael Cera makes it bearable. The other characters are minor, and do not in anyway, help move the plot or laughs along. All of the funny parts are in the trailer for the movie.

The movie isn't even aware of where it's going until the last 10 minutes, and where it ended up was pure ****.Now, I've always hated Michael Cera, and after watching this, I hate him even more. He is so one-dimensional. He plays the same role in every movies he's in. Don't believe me? Watch Juno, Nick & Norah's Infinite s***hole, Superbad, and Year One side-by-side. He is the ****ing SAME!!! Oh, and I'm a fan of Jack Black, but you could tell he just didn't want to be there. Pure ballsack.And lastly, I never laughed once.

166,kirksheppard,Wasted Talent and then there's Jack Black,1,19 June 2009,"What a stinking pile of dog crap. Or bear crap, as in one of the many lowlights of this movie, Jack Black's character takes a bite out of in a ""hilarious"" moment. (Quotations used to imply ""sarcasm."") This film was stupid, unfunny, and that's only the first 45 minutes.I couldn't tell you what happened after that because for the first time in many years (and only the 3rd or 4th time in my life), I walked out of the theater in disgust.Jack Black plays a primeval hunter/gather - who sucks at both - who is excommunicated by his tribe for his incompetence. Michael Cera, whom was hailed as the best new comedic actor of this generation, plays his sidekick. Cera, who I believe in my heart of hearts is destined to be a huge comedic star, should fire his agent immediately and find a movie like Juno to redeem himself. In fairness, Cera's acting was funny, but the situations that he and Jack Black found themselves in were not. I don't even know what the characters names were and since they were virtually playing themselves in silly costumes in a ""parody"" of Biblical history, I don't think it even matters.There was so much wasted talent in this picture. David Cross, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, and the list goes on. Harold Ramis directed it and he's fallen so far from the classics he used to make like Vacation, Caddy Shack, and Groundhog Day. Paul Rudd had a cameo as Able, the brother of Cain, who got murdered. I was envious that he got out of the picture faster than I did.I really don't understand why this movie wasn't funnier, except to say that Jack Black - who showed promise in Shallow Hal and School of Rock - has been coasting ever since. Tropic Thunder, for instance, was funny when he wasn't on screen. I don't know if he just doesn't care because he's so rich or if he really thinks eating poop is hysterical.Anyway, don't see this movie. Not even if someone else is paying or if you have free passes. It was bad. They either needed to be smarter or go for the hard R rating and be more filthy. Instead, they settled for middle of the road, trying to appeal to young adolescents who I think will also be insulted by the lack of humor presented.I'm sure some religious groups will rail about it being offensive and sacrilegious; it was, of course. But I was mostly offended by how unfunny it was.",Year One

I was expecting a repeat of Nacho Libre, funny but the whole time your not really paying attention to the plot because the characters are stupid and overdrawn. I believe the characters did a perfect part in getting into their rolls. This movie was straight up hilarious, it pushed the PG-13 limit pretty hard and made up for it completely with excellent acting, writing, and goddamn clever idiocy. It struck me as an immature movie for adults, not just stupid jokes but reminding us that stupid characters and penis jokes are still funny as long as they're not pummeled to death in to the point of not meriting any laughs. Everything is done subtly and with class, but at the same time being screamingly funny. The bottom line is that basically the writing and directing was just good enough for the awesome cast to swoop in and give you a comedy that'll knock you out. Because I know there will be comparisons I've decided to blatantly say... its better than school of rock.",Year One

He starts ruminating like a philosopher and comes to the conclusion that ""everything is just so weeeird"". Of course, all this is for comic purpose. So who are more stupid? The makers of the movie who make such scenes in a comedy, which being low brow is not really to be taken seriously, just enjoyed.

Jack Black character says something along the lines of sleeping with his own mother .Awkward . and he cant stop here apparently his sister Juno Temple is also his daughter! Jesus! Do not watch that movie with your mom it gets really awkward. That aside I really like this movie.Some pompous guys complained that characters are too modern to be realistic .I think thats what makes it tick modern style dialogue with animals hives and unruly hair. Another guy were saying he didn't remember a single onliner from the movie.Neither have I .But Sunday at church I got this image stacking in my head Caine doing a poor job killing his suckup brother and nearly giggled.

172,offspring-29737,A breezy time with Jack Black in Nomadic/Greco Roman Times,6,27 August 2018,"I knew little about this film besides how it was advertised when I was 9. So watching this film at 18, I was pleasantly surprised for the zero expectations I had.While it doesn't delve into spoofing films of the historical-adventure genre like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" what matters is what's in the journey itself and the circumstances that can arise. Jack Black and Michael Cera have okay chemistry, yet their individual modern day senses of humor works for the sort of situations they experience much to their misfortune. Black especially excels as a psychotic Neanderthal who always goes with his gut instinct due to believing he's destined for a noble life as being among the chosen. Cera is more or less the straight-man of the duo, but has his moments.The supporting characters do okay as well. However, I kinda thought that Hank Azaria was underused and David Cross delivers an awkwardly passive-aggressive performance. There are the occasional low-brow crap and piss jokes, but they're brief and never pose as a distraction.In all, the film comes close to being a spoof of adventure epics, yet to no cigar.

But the first ten minutes ruined that. However I persevered hoping that something might happen. It did: an overt antisemitic(or anti-Israel TBH) run in the storyline from a Hollywood far too gutless or politically prejudiced to ever dare make a movie criticising a certain ideology who seem to gain pleasure from sawing off heads, chopping off hands and stoning people (mostly women) to death, NOT 2000 years ago but NOW. BTW in case someone jumps onto the bigot bandwagon, I am agnostic but i like to see some truth just occasionally and even Hollywood cannot be that bigoted and escape criticism. Don't waste your time unless adolescent humour and crass stupidity posing as humour attracts you.

I did giggle at about three points watching this, but spent most of the time wishing it to end. The funniest scenes I had already seen in the trailer. I don't see why comedies like this continue to be made, with promises such as ""Comedy of the year"" or ""5 stars"". Most of these movies are targeted at younger audiences, but that's not the case for this as it contained some swearing and a LOT of sexual innuendo.

191,scheuric,Not Much More to it than the Preview,4,10 August 2009,"The clever arrangement of juxtaposing ancient times and way of life with modern day humor and personality only goes so far in Year One.Director Harold Ramis (National Lampoon's Vacation, Groundhog Day) constructs a comedy in which two outcast tribesmen (Jack Black and Michael Cera) are forced to leave their small society of hunters and gatherers and venture on their own. On their way, they encounter biblical characters Cane and Abel (David Cross, Paul Rudd) and Abraham and Isaac (Hank Azaria, Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and eventually make their way to the infamous city of Sodom.All comedic value of the film comes to a halt about 20 minutes after the opening credits. After reaching the sin city, the travelers encounter – and must overcome – the ridiculous culture of the ancient Sodomites, which falls just short of amusing. Jack Black and Michael Cera deliver their usual performances of outrageousness and timidity, respectively, which would be okay if the script were in their favor. Unfortunately, the jokes about our ancestors grow old quickly and are not enough to sustain 97 minutes of screen time.If you have seen the previews for this film, you get the idea.

At 'the end of the world' they come upon a beautiful valley with a more evolved culture. Farmers have taken over planting their own food and raising their own livestock. The first farm they come across is being run by (2) brothers, one named Cain and the other, Abel.

196,cal3331,"Kind of funny, mostly gross",3,18 June 2009,"""Year One"" is a bit of a disappointment. I usually like Jack Black movies, despite being more of a period-costumes-and-subtitles sort of movie-goer. However, this film is not even up to the standards of the typical JB fare. It's merely a bunch of scatological and sexual jokes, and lame ones at that, strung together in a completely implausible historical context. The storyline is weak, and the performances were merely adequate. Some laughs, to be sure, but I am glad I did not spend money on this. I think I spent more time pondering if Olivia Wilde's accent was genuine (I don't think so, since she was born in America) than I did laughing at the movie. If you are thinking of taking preteen children, I would strongly caution against that, but use your own judgment. I wish I had!

Some of the wittiest biting satire of all time. This is ""The Life of Brian"" for a new generation, and has a tinge of Monty Python humor (as in modern sensibility applied to historic eras). The greatest feat of the film was accomplished when co-writer Judd Apatow (of 40-yr old Vigrin fame) realized the lovable nerd Michael Cera portrays would have instant chemistry with chronic scene-stealer Jack Black. The Duo is the product of prodigy and providence which delivers laughs so fast the audience will miss one joke for laughing at another.The movie clearly targets a younger audience much like Python and Borat, but even older critics with a good sense of humor will break apart chuckling as a somewhat type-cast Cera interacts with a brutal unforgiving culture that relishes blood sacrifice.

The time you spend seeing it will be a black hole in your life. Jack eats poo in this movie, this movie IS that poo! It's not funny, not offensive, though the poor Michael Cera, normally very good with decent material,is put through terrible actions, trying for humor.

As has been said the only remotely funny moments are in the preview and to be honest, they came across as far less funny with the setup and delivery of the scene in context.

It was a case of laughing at that person rather than with them. This film was utter crap honestly Michael Cera isn't funny at all in his awkward style. It's just amazing how some Studio executive can give the go ahead for this film i really hope they didn't spend a lot of money making it.

Considering I'm not fond of either of the actors in the two main roles, I really wanted to see this film. When I finally got around to watching it, I now understand why it struck a chord with me.Without ever claiming to be a tribute to Mel Brooks, that's exactly what it ended up as. If you liked History of the World Part One you will like Year One as our two cave men progress up through the early years of human civilization and culture, encountering various biblical figures and getting themselves in and out of various tight spots.It was really a fun little film that I think most all fans of Mel Brooks would appreciate. It is as much a nod to JudeoChristian history as it also pans it. It is a nod to Mel Brooks without being a complete copy cat of Mr. Brooks. It is meant to be a romp and not a serious film.People who brushed it off should give it a second chance and not try to over analyze or read to deep into it and just have a little fun.

I laughed out loud at Oliver Platt's High Priest and especially Hank Azaria doing a hilarious George C Scott impression/parody as Abraham (see 1966's ""The Bible""). David Cross is funny and a bit disturbing as Cain too. His best line: ""You know the best thing about Sodom? The sodomy. You're in for a treat!""

I am honestly surprised at the negative reviews this film has been getting! I believe too many people go to see Year One expecting a cinematic masterpiece, which obviously is NOT what Harold Ramis was going for. If you take it for what is is, Black and Cera playing basically themselves in a funny spin on a few ancient history/bible stories, it is actually quite fun!Black and Cera give performances just as you would expect them. Black is loud, over confident, slightly oafish, and driven by his libido. Cera is soft-spoken, meek, and constantly combating with his lack of masculinity. They play exactly who they play in any other role they have been in, which some find boring and repetitive, but that performance is the whole point of the film! These actors are doing what they do best in a very unconventional setting, which makes for all kinds of laughs! The supporting cast also gives memorable roles, including Platt's High Priest, Cross and Rudd's portrayal of Cain and Abel, and Azaria's HILARIOUS Abraham. The only casting issue I did have was Juno Temple playing Cera's love interest Eema. The actress , though 19 when filming, appears to be much younger, and is immediately introduced as a sex object, which made me a little uncomfortable.The plot does a fantastic job of leading the main characters through several biblical stories and settings. Many complain that the settings and stories spoofed (tree of knowledge, Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, Sodom and Gomorrah, etc) could no way exist at the same time, to which I say: SHUT UP. I'd like to see you do a better job. This is a simple comedy, and should not be picked apart by the historical inaccuracies. The same goes for the point that everyone in the story speaks the same language. Just give it some liberties and have fun.Leaving the theater, I was still laughing. Black gives several lines that are sure to stick in your head (including one about why he is having a hard time listening to Cain's sister Lillith), and acts just awkward enough for you to identify with him completely. If you walk into the theater without scrutiny or high expectations, you will leave pleasantly surprised.",Year One

There are sequences lifted from short two reel comedies of The Three Stooges that were by comparison brilliant in those humble little 16 minute shorts while here the gags are stretched beyond any wit or level of real humor.

At first it seemed to be good material, a comical approach to every day life in a cave tribe. But after a while it seemed the writer was trying to get even with his Sunday School teacher for lessons from Genesis about a loving God and the families of Adam and Abraham. Painted Abraham as a wacko bent on vengeance. Actually in Genesis Abraham begged God to save the city of Sodom. OK, I know it wasn't meant to be a documentary. I don't know, just didn't appeal to me.

Michael Cera takes the cake as the funniest guy in the movie, almost every line brings if not a laugh then at least a smile to your face. His scenes with Oliver Platt are the funniest I have seen in a while. Black is the funniest when he grosses out the audience, and there are quite a few gross-out scenes, not all with him, but all equally disturbing and hilarious. Other than this, its classic Black humor, in my opinion a bit hit and miss. (more hits than misses though)While i won't go into all that much of the plot, its enough to say that this movie isn't one that will leave you awed, surprised or anything like that, but it does, like most of Harold Ramis' movies; entertain and make you laugh. I definitely enjoyed it, despite some rather bad seats, and for someone who believes bad seats can ruin a movie, that is saying something.

I can only imagine how hilarious it must have been for these actors to work on it. I think it's a modern American ode to Monty Python's 'The Life of Brian', except it's even better and funnier in my humble opinion. I really don't get the hate for this film but I suspect it's mostly from people who are christian and can't laugh about it, or people who simply don't understand the humor and/or references.The script and dialogue is ridiculous and hilarious, and the cast is chock full of modern comedic legends (stand outs for me are the high priest - played by Oliver Platt, Abraham by Hank Azaria, and of course our two main characters Oh (son of Ooh from the house of sticks and dung) & Zed played by Michael Cera & Jack Black respectively). If you like the silliness of Monty Python, and the dead pan humor of Michael Cera mixed with the energetic hilarity that is Jack Black, please do yourself a favor and give this film a chance!

223,jalmanzo,Is the vast majority dead wrong?,8,19 June 2009,"Firstly, let me mention that this is my first IMDb post ever and I feel compelled to make this post based on many different things. I went into this movie with no prior knowledge other than a trailer of the movie where michael cera gets berries knocked out of his hands etc. The scene made me laugh and I thought that Jack Black and Cera could be a good pairing for a comedy. I did not know that the movie was directed by Harold Ramis nor that the script was written by Ramis as well as the guys from The Office (all three of whom are comedy geniuses), nor did I know that the movie had been panned by Roger Ebert: the only movie critic whom i actually respect in that we have very similar taste in movies. If I had read the Ebert review (1 star), I probably wouldn't have gone to see the movie but nonetheless I did. There are two kinds of comedy: comedy with a moral to the story and mindless comedy for the sole purpose of making people laugh. This is the latter but it is done to perfection. I'm not going to talk about the movie itself other than to say that the scenes with Oliver Platt and Cera had me laughing as hard as the first half hour of Borat (i.e. I could barely breathe). I'm not claiming that this movie is a classic, in fact I'll admit that there was no real point to the movie and the philosophical bits fell pretty flat but all in all there were many scenes in this movie where Ramis' genius is apparent. I went to the movie to get some laughs and I definitely got my moneys worth. For a quick example of some other comedies which had me leaving a large amount of pee for theatre personnel to mop up later: A Fish Called Wanda,...The Holy Grail, Office Space, Borat, Austin Powers, Happy Gilmore. OK I didn't see most of these in the theatre but you get the point. I can't really say why so many people are panning Year One. My only thought is that they really just don't get the humor. Obviously there is a plentiful supply of people on IMDb that will not like this notion since they couldn't possibly be wrong about anything but in my opinion they are mistaken when it comes to this movie. I have a feeling that people's opinions of this movie will change in time. Is it possible that a pointless cave man comedy could be before its time?

Cera tried to do as much as he could with what he was given but everything was flat.

That makes me pretty happy, because I would have been distraught if I had to pay $7.50 to sit through this mess. The plot was very contrived, and the historical humour fizzled out after the first twenty minutes. The rest of the movie relied on a myriad of sexual innuendos that were overused and abused.

230,jcazale33,Epic Potty Humor,7,17 June 2009,"This is an odd one - consistently funny throughout, sometimes uproariously so, but doesn't leave you with much. I say this comparing it to the granddaddy of these movies, Monty Python's Life of Brian, which is probably unfair. Monty Python had the off-the-wall ability to turn these kind of movies (and eras) into absurdist social commentary, a true satire of life that made the jokes really resonate, and in so doing create quotable punchlines and relatable scenarios even when viewed today. In this, Michael Cera comes off best, he has a sweetness that really gives the movie an ounce of heart. Jack Black is - well, Jack Black. He is funny, but his act has been seen with various backdrops and he is probably in need of something which will challenge his talents, always tough for a comedian who has honed their comic persona to a fine point. There are a few small moments that truly rise to Monty Python greatness - Michael Cera encountering a ""volunteer"" among the slaves laboring in mud for example - but for the most part, the movie reverts to poop humor whenever it gets the chance (and yes, Jack Black does eat realistic, gooey poop in close-up.) I think this is probably best viewed as a parody of Roland Emmerich's daft epic 10000 BC (the caveman to great civilization visual transition, hair styles etc), but you could probably argue that that was a Clan of the Cave Bear anyway... i.e. so bad it felt like a parody anyway. So think of this as the better parts of Mel Brooks' Vaudeville Shlepic ""History of the World Part I"" and while you're at it, hand some kudos to the filmmakers - obviously filmed in some quite extreme locations (you can see fogging breath in some shots), they created a movie that rarely drags, is consistently funny, yet at the end of the day leaves you wondering what the point of it all was.",Year One

The movie was decent at first but then it started to become repetitive. Most of the jokes were meant for 10 year olds and the jokes meant for older people were just not that funny. For the last 20 minutes of the movie I was just waiting for the end. I do not recommend this movie if you pay full price, only pay if it is a cheap night.

233,soul-reincarnated,not as Hilarious as it was expected out of the promos,5,20 June 2009,"Hi all, this is my first review so I might not know the exact words but would see how far I could go with this, hope it helps. I have seen more like about 6000 movies in total and I do understand what comedy is all about, and since this movie is classified under comedy, anyone would expect a reasonable amount of humor in it. The first thing I noticed about the movie was that the background lacked punch in it. It just doesn't give u the feel of watching a movie if the sound effects really don't make u sit up while you watch the movie. The movie started with a nice note but gradually it lost the plot and eventually though the humor started on nice not, it lacked punch in its dialog's and speech which didn't really make me laugh thinking it was supposed to be a comedy movie. The movie failed to explain a lot of things that the director could have shaped it well, like how did Michael Cera escape the snake and the Cougar, it could have been done in a better way. As far as the cast is concerned, Michael Cera clearly tried to capture the audience as Zack struggled with it. Over all the movie was worth watching at home with family once the DVD is out, but definitely not worth watching it at a theaters near you as it lacked the punch that drives one to the nearest theaters.",Year One
234,raidersfan858,"Exactly what it should have been, yet cruelly underrated.",9,21 June 2009,"When I first saw the in theater preview for this movie, I was extremely excited. I went home and got onto Facebook and became a fan of the movie, which provided me with updates containing every video pertaining to Year One that was out there. I saw all of these videos and laughed hysterically, but I began to get a feeling that the movie would consist of what was in the previews and be nothing more than around 15 minutes of funny dragged out over a 90 minute period of time.I was wrong.When the movie started, I began to become even more worried I would hate it because within the first 20 minutes of the movie, at least 3/4 of the things seen in the previews were already said. I figured it was going to drag on from there. To my great relief, it did not at all. The entire hour and a half of the movie was constant laughing. The way Black and Cera got themselves into so much trouble and managed to get out of it every time was perfect. The ridiculous yet hilarious references to The Bible and how things that exist today were created were perfect. The movie was exactly what it was supposed to be: a laugh out loud comedy that was only meant to entertain.I am still baffled as to why people keep bashing this movie. Comments like ""Worst Movie of the Decade"" anger me... What were people expecting with this movie? A heart warming story with a compelling plot and serious action? It is like everybody is sizing this movie up to expectations that it doesn't need to be sized up to. This movie was a great movie if all you want to do is go in and laugh.

Jack Black and Michael Cera playing themselves, yeah, where was that even considered funny? Now I absolutely adore these actors, Michael was a great choice in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and Jack Black has proved he can do great comedy like Tropic Thunder & Kid Rock.I am a Christian and was very offended by the content. I gave it over an hour hoping it would get better but it got worse. We walked out, we paid $10.00 a ticket and had four people. Thank God the theater gave us comp tickets to see another movie.

The main character is hapless, not too bright, and absurdly enthusiastic. The story is chaotic and fun. There are no profound moments and the acting won't blow you away. This is a feel-good-movie without the schmaltz.This film could have been much better. Yes, the characters could have had depth and they could have laid off the teenage humour, but that's not the real problem. In fact I thought the jokes were brilliantly clever - some of them made me wonder what life was really like thousands of years ago. No, the real problem for me was the gay jokes. It's boring to watch a happily married heterosexual (Oliver Platt) act as yet another clichéd unattractive predatory effeminate gay man. The High Priest is as good a source of entertainment as a minstrel show - only funny if you're a bigot.I would recommend this film to all fans of Jack Black.

Year One has many laugh out loud moments and unlike many comedies they aren't all exhausted in the first 15 minutes. The humour is silly and no, don't look for sophistication, but when I think of all the poorly written SNL based films and other comedies that border on the absurd, Year One doesn't deserve the poor ratings it has. Watch it again, or for the first time whatever the case may be and be surprised at the jokes.

244,euryales,"I wanted to like it, to love it... but I simply could not",2,20 June 2009,"I came into this movie with a vision of the movie shaped by the previews. The premise sounded pathetic, but the way the preview made it appear was epic and interesting: a funny, fresh, well acted comedy taking a 'trek' through history... cavemen years, Cain and Abel, Rome, etc. I did not expect realism, I did not expect epic acting, but I did expect a creative, genuinely funny plot, decent acting, and a well written script.I kept trying, each step of the way, to enjoy this movie, to really get more humour from it. However, the way it continued to come across was this: they took a bunch of excellent actors, all good at improv, set them in a scene with amazing scenery, great props, and a general idea of what was happening, and said ""Okay, here's what is going on- go with it!"" and just let them improv it out. A great idea in premise, but it simply comes across too indirect and hard to follow- too many pauses, ramblings, etc. If there was a clearly written script, then it was a poor one.The acting is top notch, the improv pretty good- but it just doesn't hit home as really, truly funny. I felt even the improv and humour in ""Night at the Museum 2"" was more enjoyable than many of these. It relies too much on situational comedy and spoofs, such that it comes across like either a really poor attempt at a movie, or a really good Saturday Night Live skit at movie-length.A great late night video rental- a really bad movie to see in the theatre.",Year One

246,OwlCritic,Judge for yourself.,9,27 June 2009,"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer for the first time back in February. I didn't go to see it on the opening night, and then, having read all of the bad reviews here on IMDb, I was pretty put off, fearing that this is one of those movies that don't live up to a great trailer. But I went anyway, and was not disappointed. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I brought along low expectations, a light mood, and had Haagen Dazs just before the flick. On the bright side, Year One is riddled with humor, some jokes being funnier than others, and yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, some of the jokes are drawn out. Jack Black is admirably suited for the role of the anti-hero Zed, a sort of Judah Friedlander caveman who fails at everything he does, but fails -so well-. And Michael Cera, the effeminate Oh, is another manifestation of wise casting. Who better to play the virgin gatherer than Cera? At times, the movie is not -gripping-, and the trailer is a bit misleading, since it gives the impression that the movie would be mostly about cavemen meeting Romans with few biblical allusions. But the entire movie is nearly a parody about the bible, in which another explanation is offered for some of the miracles of the Old Testament. The moments when the movie is dull are few, and the dialog and characterization make up for it. Zed remains faithful to his inadequate anti-hero character throughout, and Oh keeps getting into worse trouble, as he had since the beginning. This is actually one of the best parts, in which every time Zed gets himself and Oh into trouble, Oh is the one to suffer the worse punishment. In any case, if you want to enjoy this movie, go with a light heart and just try not to take it too seriously.",Year One

The usual awkwardness of Michael Cera is a great addition and Jack Black is as wild as always. If you're not a Jack Black fan, you may not like the movie. However, I'd urge you to see it anyway just because this is one of the movies that really helped me make my mind up on him. I was hoping for a ""Year Two"" as this cavemen, going on a journey where they know nothing about anything really makes for some awesome comedy. Every actor in this played a vital role to the final product. I agree with some of the other reviews, I think you have to have a certain sense of humour for this type of film. It's not your typical comedy, it's stupid, jokey comedy. It's suggestive. But nonetheless, it did deserve better reviews. I give this film 10 out of 10 because it's always one I find myself going back to. If you do watch this, check the scene with Michael Cera and Oliver Platt when they're standing outside the Holy of Holies. Hilarious.",Year One
248,dylan_alldridge,"If a comedy has no laughs, is it still a comedy?",4,27 June 2013,"Actors who rely on schtick tend to have short intense periods of popularity, before the act gets old and audiences find it dull and annoying. Jack Black has suffered from this in recent years, and Michael Cera may well find the same issue. The problem with Year One is that it relies almost entirely on the shtick of both actors to carry it through the lazy comedy.Black and Cera play two members of a wood tribe who are still native hunter gatherers, Black is Zed, a terrible hunter who suffers from hubris and overconfidence and just wants to rebel. While Cera is Oh, a great gatherer who just wants to follow the rules and win over Zed's sister Eema. When they are kicked out of their tribe for eating forbidden fruit they find themselves on a journey to the city of Sodom, meeting several biblical characters along the way.Essentially Zed is a prehistoric version of Black's go to character, with that same strained ""bro"" delivery. Similarly, Cera is essentially a prehistoric version of George Michael Bluth. And while I do love Cera's style, there is only so many times I can watch him meekly mumble something while looking like a stuffed bird.Aptly for a film set thousands of years ago, the jokes felt about the same age. For a comedy there is a distinct lack of laughs that don't rely on poo and dick jokes. Hey, I love a poo joke. I am a puerile man- child. But I need something more than that for 90 mins. It's surprising given the presence of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, who were key writers and producers on The US Office, wrote the screenplay. It seems as a result Harold Ramis, who was probably striving for a Mel Brooks style parody of the old 50's style sword and sandals epics, relied on the popularity of Black and Cera and the slew of cameo from the likes of Hank Azaria, Paul Rudd and Christopher Mintz-Plasse to distract from the lack of laughs.It's a shame because when they are on their game all involved can be highly entertaining. Both Cera and Black have also proved recently that they are capable of diversifying, with Youth In Revolt and Bernie respectively. Unfortunately comedies need laughs, and in that department it was sorely lackingIt doesn't bode well that the 45 seconds of outtakes at the end of the movie contain more laughs than the preceding 90 minutes.

Most people won't like it, but if you liked a movie like The Love Guru last year, this will appeal to you. Nothing too clever, but funny.Basically, Jack Black and Michael Cera play their usual characters, just in loincloths. Jack can't hunt or gather, but he eats from the tree of knowledge, and both are banished into the world. David Cross plays Cain, who is the first person they meet, and actually plays someone closer to his stand up act than Tobias (David and Michael would have worked together on Arrested Development, but David shows that he can actually play another character).They go from one biblical setting to another, making fun (mainly) of the old testament, and eventually wind up in Sodom, with Cain, and the requisite love interests....I think where this movie falls down is it seems a bit like a long skit. The chemistry between Jack Black and Michael Cera I thought wasn't great, but the plot/character development was really just secondary to getting in some jokes. Obviously, the jokes won't be to everyones taste (hence the rankings of 0), and will be to others (thus the rankings of 10).Again, although this may very well win a Razzie this year, I liked it, and if you like stupid humor, this movie has lots of it.",Year One

Additionally the ad-libs that the actors were allowed to do with each take were all funnier as well. So much was cut out of the film (including a cameo by Judd Apatow) that it felt disjointed and lacked a logical progression of events. I really cannot believe how the film was edited together.

There are plenty of scenes that will give you laughs that pass as abruptly as they come and a few that are longer lasting. From crude sexual humor to semi-intelligent humor this film targets younger audiences that can look at religion in a comedic light. Most of the jokes for this film are at the expense of the Jewish and Christian religion. By no means is this a proper history lesson for anyone and shouldn't be viewed by ages 15 and under without parental permission. That said it is a funny film throughout. If you enjoy buddy films this one will deliver; especially if you are out with friends who enjoy seeing Jack Black's high energy humor and Micheal Cera's awkward teenager humor as they are pretty much in every scene.,Year One
