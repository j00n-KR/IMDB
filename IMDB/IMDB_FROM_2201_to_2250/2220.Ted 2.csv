0,bkoganbing,Does Ted have a soul?,3,7 August 2015,"Mark Wahlberg and his little stuffed buddy Ted had themselves quite a box office hit in 2012. But Ted 2 for me was quite a let down.The chemistry between Wahlberg and the teddy bear is still there to be sure but I was really put off by the cavalier and irreverent attitude toward drug use. Having recently lost someone this past year to a heroin overdose I saw very little humor in Wahlberg and the bear toking up.A whole lot of people who ought to know better really embarrassed themselves with some of the guest star roles. Really Morgan Freeman, your eloquence was wasted here.The plot was completely ripped off from a Star Trek TNG episode where Captain Picard has to defend Data's status with Starfleet. Was he property as an android or had he developed the self awareness or a soul if you will of a person. That might have been the basis for a nice fantasy film instead of going for Howard Stern like humor.",Ted 2
1,SnoopyStyle,trial sets the wrong tone,6,18 March 2016,"Ted (Seth MacFarlane) marries Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) while John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is divorced from Lori Collins. A year later, Ted and Tami-Lynn are not getting along. They decide to have a baby to save their marriage. She can't conceive and they try to adopt. The government takes notice and declares Ted not a person. They hire inexperienced lawyer Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) to fight in court. Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) is still after Ted but now he has the backing of Hasbro CEO.John and Ted's chemistry is growing on me. They're still good together and Tami-Lynn is great. The biggest problem is the trial. The whole idea of the original is that everybody treats Ted like any other loudmouthed idiot. People treats him the same as everybody else. The trial breaks that illusion and then spits on it. It's also a downer and I don't see how those court scenes be made funnier. The movie is perfectly fine as a drug caper with the boys on a road trip. I have nothing against Seyfried but MacFarlane should have gotten a real comedian in the role instead of the prettiest girl who's a little funny. There are a few other minor problems but the boys are still fun together.",Ted 2
2,Hitchcoc,How Can I Review This,8,5 July 2015,"Ted gets married to a nit brained woman and then finds out that he has lost all his civil rights because he is a toy, not a person. He is really property. That's the premise. Now load on crudities and sight gags and cameos and a bunch of nonsense. Visit Tom Brady's house to get a sperm sample to create the perfect child. Visit a field of marijuana and hear music from Jurassic Park. Find a lawyer who is ready to face the civil rights laws that keep a stuffed bear from having his say in the world. I can't review this film because, like the first one, it is one piece of craziness after another. I went away giggling, but know that civilized human beings shouldn't be watching this junk. Go see it if you have a relatively thick skin.",Ted 2
3,Prismark10,The measure of a Ted,5,18 May 2016,"Ted 2 probably looks like an unnecessary sequel but the foul mouthed dope taking duo are back and they even made me laugh a few times.Ted (voiced by Seth Macfarlane) has married Tammi-Lynn but a few months later they are involved in tantrums and their relationship is heading for the rocks. John (Mark Wahlberg) has already split up from Lori and turns down all offers to hook up.Ted wants to adopt a baby in order to save his marriage but then finds out that he needs to be classed as a person and further to this he loses his job and his marriage is not classified.Ted needs to prove to the court that he is a person and not property with the help of lawyer Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried.) Meanwhile Donny the villain from the first film has new plans to take Ted and sell him to a toy company so they can make new Teds just like him.The film has pop culture references and nods to sci fi genre and musicals as Ted has several song and dance sequences. Several members of the Star Trek franchise make cameos (I guess it is to do with the plot of what makes a man, a subject covered in ST:NG.) A segment of the film takes place at Comic-Con and Sam Jones turns up again as well as few other star appearances such as Jay Leno hanging around gents toilets and Liam Neeson wanting to buy cereal aimed at kids.A lot of it follows the first film simply because they have the same villain. The road trip element to New York to visit a high powered lawyer spoofs Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Jurassic Park.The film is amusing, a few laughs as well as a few groans. If you are under 30 years of age you are not going to get all the references but it was a better sequel than expected and you really believe John and Ted as friends who hang out together.",Ted 2
4,nogodnomasters,THIRSTY URKEL?,10,4 May 2018,"In this film Ted attempts to gain citizenship or person hood. He marries Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and is represented by young attorney Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) a person void of pop culture references.The film was laugh out loud funny with many people in the theater roaring with laughter. There was not a dry eye in the house. Yes the film is crude and contain many F-bombs. However, I feel different about this film than the first. In ""Ted"" they were crude for the sake of being crude with the humor being secondary. In this feature they were crude for a good laugh. They didn't cross the line in this feature, although they hugged it a few times.There were numerous appearances by celebrities, mostly playing themselves. I think the role of Morgan Freeman would have been funnier if Samuel L. Jackson had played the part. He could have worked in some of his famous lines. I am also disappointed that they did a comic-con convention and didn't have a funny cameo by Stan Lee. Liam Neeson, Tom Brady, and Jay Leno in funny cameos. Good one to watch with an adult crowd.Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. Crude talk. No sex. Nudity? (Kayla Delehant?)",Ted 2
5,kosmasp,Not only Ted's back,7,21 July 2015,"Ted is still funny (if you dig the completely out there humor this has), but it did lose a bit of it's previous thunder (song) - pun intended. You do get another song, but I doubt very much, that it will be as popular as the song from the first movie. Lightning in a bottle and other jokes to your liking can be inserted here.One comeback is a bit too convenient, but it's nice to see Liam Neeson, even if it's only in a weird cameo role. There's other people here and especially one ""couple"" is very over the top and might be a touch too much for some to watch (don't forget though: it's just a movie). The harassing those two do is borderline, on the other hand the intrusion of a comedy club, as wrong as it was, was kinda funny.So high and lows all the way through, you have to decide what side is winning ...",Ted 2
6,lee_eisenberg,just accept the humor,10,29 November 2016,"Pretty much all that you need to know is that ""Ted"" and ""Ted 2"" are the brainchild of ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane. Like its predecessor, ""Ted 2"" revels in crude humor. The plot is about the wise-ass anthropomorphic teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane) trying to get legal recognition as a person. Of course, it's an excuse for a bunch of stuff that shows us what people mean when they say Boston tough. Along with nonstop pop culture references, I should add. I guess that we could be cynical and say that the purpose was to get more money out of a franchise. Maybe so, but the movie's purpose is to make us laugh, and it succeeds. Pot, bodily fluids, and other types of low humor abound. Mark Wahlberg returns as Ted's slacker friend, and this time we have Amanda Seyfried as a lawyer trying to win Ted's case. We also get a number of cameos. Basically, it's two hours of silliness with some mild social commentary.So yes, we really are alone now.",Ted 2
7,jboothmillard,Ted 2,5,21 July 2015,"The first film directed by Family Guy and American Dad creator Seth MacFarlane was very good and very funny, many people wanted a sequel, me included, so it happened and I was always going to see it. Basically John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) has divorced from his long-time girlfriend Lori for six months, and now his best friend since childhood, living teddy bear Ted (MacFarlane), has got married to his girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), but following a year they are constantly fighting and their marriage is breaking down. With John's advice, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to have a baby to preserve their relationship, but Ted has no reproductive organs, at the same time Ted is encouraging John to start dating again, but he is reluctant, and addicted to Internet pornography. Failing to find a sperm donor Ted accepts John's offer to donate, but and Tami-Lynn is devastated to find out that constant drug use has damaged her ovaries and left her infertile, so the only option is for them to adopt a baby, however this only ignites a barrage of law against Ted. Because John wished for Ted to come to life as a child, and originally being an ordinary teddy bear, he is classed as being property, leading to the loss of his job, his financial accounts and his marriage being annulled, but John is determined to help his friend fight for his human rights, taking the case to court. They can only afford novice lawyer Samantha Leslie Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), she is reluctant to take the case, but the three bond smoking marijuana and work together to form a case, meanwhile Ted's stalker Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) is a janitor at Hasbro Toy Company headquarters, he is determined to make sure they fail, convincing CEO Tom Jessup (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch) if Ted loses they can get him, as property, and study him to make other living teddy bears. Ted loses his case and is devastated, desperate he, Samantha and John decide to go and see highly respected civil rights attorney Patrick Meighan (Morgan Freeman) in the hope of overturning the court's decision, so they head for New York, they are delayed by a car crash, but spend the night in a hidden marijuana patch, it is there John and Samantha get closer with attraction. The next morning they meet with Meighan, he is sympathetic to Ted's plight, but refuses the case, he believes Ted has not contributed to humanity, due to his juvenile and slacker lifestyle, Ted is angered and jealous of John and Samantha's relationship and runs away, followed by Donny, as he wanders into the New York Comic Con. Ted realises that Donny is following him and calls John for help, he and Samantha arrive to help, they save Ted before he is cut open, but Donny cuts the cable holding up the model of the starship Enterprise, it is dropped, but John pushes Ted out of the way, he is hit by the model and goes into a coma, while Donny is arrested. John is revealed to be fine at the hospital, Meighan watched on television that John was willing to give up his life for Ted's, he reconsiders taking the case, the ruling is overturned because Ted has displayed self- awareness, feels complex emotions and can empathise, with Ted finally recognised as a person he re-proposes to Tami-Lynn, they are remarried with Ted adopting the surname ""Clubberlang"", and they adopt a baby that they name Apollo Creed, and John and Samantha pursue a happy relationship. Narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart, and also starring Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon), Patrick Warburton as Guy, Star Trek: The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Rick, Liam Neeson as Customer, Dennis Haysbert as Fertility Doctor, John Slattery as Shep Wild, Ron Canada as Judge, Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel and Tom Brady. Wahlberg is still good being naive, Seyfried is a pretty new love interest for him (but I preferred Mila Kunis), and the rude, crude computer-animated teddy bear voiced and animated by MacFarlane is still completely lovable, look out for the many funny cameos as well. This sequel is not as much fun as the first film, mostly because it becomes too much about the civil rights and dramatic stuff, so it's not as lean and mean, but it does have the man and his bear buddy to keep things together, and there are enough moments to make you laugh when it should, I was crying laughing with the scene inside the sperm donation facility, so it is not a bad comedy. Worth watching!",Ted 2
8,BA_Harrison,Unashamedly crass. And a lot of fun.,7,18 January 2016,"When Ted's marriage to Tami-Lynn hits a rough patch, the bear believes that having a baby might help bring the couple closer together again. Unable to father a child himself, due a lack of genitalia, Ted tries to find a sperm donor, eventually accepting an offer of help from lifelong pal John (Mark Wahlberg); however, when Tami-Lynn proves to be barren, the bear and his wife turn to adoption, which brings Ted to the attention of the authorities, who question the bear's status as a human. With help from young lawyer Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), Ted enters a legal battle to prove that he not just property; meanwhile, Ted-obsessed lunatic Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) makes a deal with a Hasbro executive that puts the bear in mortal danger.Ted 2 is, rather unsurprisingly, more of the same: a couple of hours of utter silliness featuring wall-to-wall profanity, politically incorrect humour, and gross-out gags. With the novelty of seeing a cute teddy bear doing drugs and talking about sex having worn off a bit, writer/director McFarlane compensates by making this second film even more near the knuckle, including jokes about masturbation, jizz, 9/11, black cocks, gays, Charlie Hebdo, internet porn, nerd culture, and a bong shaped liked a penis. Not all of the craziness work, but although not quite as consistently funny as the original film, there are still enough laughs to be had to keep the majority of Ted fans more than happy.Strangely enough, several of my favourite moments are amongst the least offensive: the comparison of Amanda Seyfried to Gollum is hilarious (so funny to have Amanda go along with the joke!), a Three Amigos-style campfire scene involving a penguin and a lobster is too daft not to love, and a brawl at New York ComicCon offers up some brilliant sight gags.",Ted 2
9,paul_haakonsen,We must have outgrown the teddy bear...,5,21 April 2017,"Now, I will admit that I enjoyed the absurdity of the first movie and found the first movie to be very funny and enjoyable. So of course I was expecting at least the same level from the sequel.But it went as most sequel do, the wrong way. ""Ted 2"" turned out to be nothing more than a mediocre attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie. It was lacking all the comedy and funny situations as were present in the first movie. It was a bad decision to opt for a more serious approach for the sequel, because it just didn't pan out and it failed to work in any way.It just got tiring to watch Ted and his girlfriend trying to fight for their right to have a baby, and it just sidetracked the movie entirely. It took a heavy toll on the comedy that could have been there, and they had a lot of chances to go for something hilarious.""Ted 2"" suffered from having a what seemed to be hastily written storyline which was under duress from a deadline. And whatever comedy was written into the movie, just was way under the standards set in the first movie. The dialogue, satire and jokes in part two were not even half as in-your-face as in the first movie.And it didn't really help much that it seemed like Mark Wahlberg sort of didn't want to be present for the filming of the movie. His commitment and enthusiasm from the first movie was nowhere to be seen in this sequel.Sure there were a couple of laughs here and there, but ""Ted 2"" was nowhere near its predecessor in any way. And while you can return to watch the ""Ted"" movie again and again, that proves not to be the case with the sequel. This is a watch once and let it fade into sweet oblivion situation.The only thing that had me amused and entertained was the entire scene taking place at the convention. That was actually the high point of the entire movie.It has been seen, and I can check it off the to-watch-list, and I can't claim to be impressed in any way by ""Ted 2"".",Ted 2
10,tavm,Ted 2 has almost as much laughs as the first one,7,1 July 2015,"So I just watched this sequel to Ted with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it the previous day but was willing to go through it again since he enjoyed it so much. This one has the animated teddy bear marrying his girlfriend from the previous one and then having lots of arguments with her a year later. Somewhere along the line, they decide to have a baby to solve that dilemma and...well, to make a long story short, Ted suddenly is not considered a person but property meaning he can't legally enjoy the benefits of human beings. I found myself laughing quite a bit and being touched by the role reversal of Mark Wahlberg this time being in danger of not living. Amanda Seyfried plays his new girlfriend and Morgan Freeman plays a possible attorney taking Ted's case. In summary, Ted 2 probably stretched Seth MacFarlane's premise as much as it can go though I suppose if another sequel gets made, me and my friend will probably go to that one as well...",Ted 2

12,LeonLouisRicci,Seth MacFarlane Keeps On Keeping On For His Fans and Despite His Critics,8,13 January 2016,"Seth MacFarlane bounces back from His dismal ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" (2014) and does what He does best, reference Pop Culture. His vulgar stuff has become such a Self-Imposed given that at times it appears it is there only because it is expected. After all, how far can You go with Poop and Farts. It's just redundant.But His legion of Fans expect it and has become a Touch-Tone and Badge of Honor for Him and His Audience and is used to separate the Card Carriers from the Curious. This one may be better than the First, but that is hard to qualify or quantify.Some of the Jokes are hilarious and the amount of attempts to draw a laugh is huge. It is Non-Stop, and that's a good thing. There is a certain rhythm that is difficult to pull off in a two-hour Running Time, but it mostly manages.MacFarlane has an obvious sensitive side that never seems contrived or forced, it comes off as sincere. That may be His Saving Grace. Because no matter how many times He is Un-PC or Racist with His Humor, or just Flat-Out Gross, it all seems like Good-Natured Jabs, like You know, among Friends.Overall, this Movie should please His Fans, but it is unlikely to gain Him any new ones. You either like Seth MacFarlane and what He does or You don't. The overwhelming success of ""Family Guy"", and now His ""Ted"" Movies makes it obvious that this likable Gadfly will be around to ""Poke the Eye"" of Prudes, the PC, and the Censors for some Time.",Ted 2
13,zardoz-13,Hilarious Teddy Tale,9,3 July 2015,"The last thing Hollywood wants to do is either insult or offend individuals, groups, races, religions, causes, genders, and ideologies with their films. The refreshing thing about the hilarious teddy bear satire ""Ted"" and its unapologetic sequel ""Ted 2"" is that neither have any such compunctions. Seth MacFarlane, who co-scripted, directed, and provided the titular teddy bear's voice, spends most of ""Ted 2"" saying and showing subject matter most respectable people would think twice about before either saying or showing. Like its iconoclastic predecessor, ""Ted 2"" bears an R-rating for what the Motion Picture Association of America considers ""crude and sexual content, pervasive language, and some drug use."" The subversive humor either will make you cringe in horrific revulsion or howl in gleeful elation. If you enjoyed ""Ted"" with its cretinous heroes, beyond borderline gross out humor, wanton drug abuse, and impertinent profanity, you'll love this high-brow sequel. The worst thing you can say about ""Ted 2"" is it is pretentious from start to finish. Clearly, MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" co-scribes Alec Sulken and Wellesley Wild sought to overshadow the lowbrow original, and they have triumphed in this respect. If you haven't seen ""Ted,"" you probably won't understand half of the hilarity. During a thunderstorm, young John Bennett clutched his Hasbro teddy and made a wish it would come to life, and it did! Subsequently, they became ""thunder buddies for life."" Virtually everybody from ""Ted"" reprises their roles in ""Ted 2,"" except Mila Kunis. According to the Internet Movie Database, Kunis didn't return as Lori because she was pregnant during the production with Ashton Kutcher's baby. Meantime, MacFarlane and his co-scribes explain that John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg of ""Contraband"") and she divorced for six months before the outset of the action. A dejected John is petrified of getting himself involved in another relationship and his life has spiraled out of control. Meantime, Ted and Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth of ""Next"") marry, but their marriage has degenerated into a disaster. They argue about finances, throw things, and Ted cusses out their neighbors. At the supermarket where Ted works as a cashier, an obese African-American cashier advises him that the best way to restore a marriage is to have a baby. Tami-Lynn breaks her angry vow of silence with Ted after he tells her they must have a baby, and they celebrate their momentous decision.Sadly, neither are prepared for the trials and tribulations that ensue. Since the toy company Hasbro didn't endow Ted with sex organs, our hero must search for the ideal sperm donor. They approach Flash (Sam J. Jones), but he complains about his low sperm count. John suggests Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady. Now, things get really bizarre. John and Ted sabotage Brady's air conditioner so he has to sleep with his bedroom balcony windows open. These two nitwits set out to obtain a sperm sample from Brady while he is asleep! Ted decks himself out like a seafaring fisherman for the occasion, and John is appalled to learn that he must masturbate Brady. Fortunately, for everybody involved, Brady awakens in time and throws them out. Johnny offers to help Ted, and they enter a fertility clinic. A comedy of errors occurs when John tips over a storage bin of sperm samples accidentally and gets covered with sperm. Nevertheless, everything goes awry when Tammy-Lynn's physician (Dennis Haysbert) informs her that she devastated her reproductive system abusing narcotics. Ultimately, Ted learns the State of Massachusetts no longer recognizes his status as a person so they cannot adopt a child. Furthermore, the court has invalidated their marriage. Ted and John seek legal representation. The best they can afford is 26-year old Samantha Leslie Jackson (Amanda Seyfried of ""Les Misérables""), a freshman attorney who smokes a bong to counteract the ill effects of migraines. Predictably, since Ted and John are still getting wasted, several scenes of euphoric pot-smoking ensue, with our heroes and heroine smoking in public places, too.Just when everything appears to be working out favorably for our heroes, the villainous Donnie from ""Ted"" surfaces. Donnie (Giovanni Ribisi of ""Public Enemies"") has gotten a job as a janitor now at Hasbro. He interrupts Hasbro executive Tom Jessup (John Carroll Lynch of ""Zodiac"") during a hallway conference and tells him that he doesn't flip the cakes in his urinal. Instead, he replaces them. Naturally, Jessup doesn't know what to make of this sinister cretin. Later, Donnie has a moment with Jessup in Jessup's office because Hasbro has an open-door policy with its employees. The news is out that Ted is going to court to determine what his status in society is. Donnie tells Jessup if the prosecution can prove that Ted is actually property rather than a person, they can abduct him with minor legal consequences, slice him open, and fathom what makes Ted so singular. Jessup's eyes gleam at the prospect of eviscerating Ted so Hasbro can manufacture a new teddy that will sell millions. Mind you, Ted the talking teddy still looks as adorable as he did in first film. You never get the impression the cast was interacting with nothing when the CGI Ted was on-screen with them. While Ted dominates the action with his woes, Mark Wahlberg's John stands out as his best friend. Until ""Ted"" and now again with ""Ted 2,"" Wahlberg has deviated rarely from playing a straight-up, conventional, role model, W.A.S.P. protagonist. As he did initially with ""Ted,"" Wahlberg appears to be poaching on Adam Sandler territory with some of his absurd antics. The splashy scene in the sperm facility and the loony episode in Tom Brady's mansion make John the butt of the jokes, and Wahlberg displays no inhibitions to playing second banana to Ted while ridiculing himself in the process. The dialogue again qualifies as quotable material with politically incorrect meanings. Although the sight gags are amusing, this above-average gross-out comedy serves up some pretty impudent shenanigans. Indeed, if vulgar humor poses no problems, ""Ted 2"" is right for you.",Ted 2
14,oscaralbert,TED 2 piggy-backs itself upon the U.S. Supreme Court case . . .,6,7 July 2015,". . . which ended up legalizing gay marriage nationwide. Most experts credit 50 years of subtle and then not-so-subtle Hollywood opinion shaping efforts for the shifting tide in court (and public) beliefs. TED 2 marks the beginning of a new open phase in Tinsel Town's latest crusade championing the ""right"" of anyone to marry anything, with both parties being accorded full and inalienable human rights. ""Where's the harm in that?"" you may ask. Well, if headlines such as MY WIFE FLICKA and GUESS WHAT'S COMING TO DINNER? are not enough to give you the Heebie Jeebies, just wait until a Chicken McNugget sues you in court for torture and dismemberment. When pets and toys are being joined in wedded bliss left and right, prices for these current commodities are sure to skyrocket. When an NBA owner marries a life-size sex doll and wills his team to her, eventually she'll become the senior owner on the circuit, if not commissioner. CHUCKIE FOR PRESIDENT may sound like the title of a horror movie sequel, but he's bound to out-poll Donald Trump.

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Of Fitzgeralds, impromptu road trips and internet porn",7,17 July 2015,"Kunis left. I know, obvious, single guy easier than couple. However, apparently, she didn't return because she's pregnant with Ashton Kutcher's kid, which is ironic, since even without being in this, she's involved with the child of someone dumb, obnoxious, inexplicably popular who refuses to grow up. Adoption to fix a failing relationship. No way to do that without being heterosexual... wait, no, being a person. Preaching doesn't have to be boring. Anyway, no, there's no plot, and a lot happens that doesn't progress it.

She tries... everyone does), so that she can get together with... do I even need to say? Tami-Lynn(Barth, unstable and white trash) gets some to work with, albeit is only in about 50% of this. Donny(Ribisi, as creepy and psychotic as before) is back, in the same role, making less sense this time. Cameos are overused, and oddly full of missed opportunities – as a lot else in this. I'm not sure anything was cut from this. Except those two bits that were in the trailers, which thankfully did not give away all of the best material, albeit a lot of it.Wait, you're still with me? Wow. Well... I laughed. Like, a lot. When this works, it's hilarious. That's one of three jokes. The second you ""get"", without them getting even a smile or smirk from you. And the third just falls flat. I'm glad I put money towards this, and sat down in a packed theater who were just as into it as I was. I'm not kidding... I stand by that. Yes, of course, I wish this was spared the earlier-mentioned problems, the structure or lack thereof, how this feels like a long cartoon episode, has several climaxes and ""calm down"" periods, and hope someone cuts it down. Of course, that does bring up people complaining it's two and a half hours, feels longer than that... I don't stay through the credits. And I don't count previews. These are things which, I'd like to note, are entirely possible to avoid. I noted when it started and ended.

16,neil-476,A good sequel,8,16 July 2015,"Ted, the teddy bear miraculously brought to life in the original film, marries but, when attempting to adopt a child, is deemed to be not a legal person, thus embroiling him in a court battle to try to establish his legal existence while avoiding those who would wish to classify him as property, and cut him up to find out how he is alive.The foul-mouthed dope-smoking teddy bear (Seth Macfarlane) is back, accompanied by his foul-mouthed, dope-smoking less than intellectual friend John (Mark Wahlberg), and this time they are joined by a foul-mouthed, dope-smoking female attorney Sam (Amanda Seyfried). If I give the impression that this movie is predicated on profanity and dope-smoking, well, that's because it is. And perhaps a little bit too much so, because there is so much here which is good that it's a shame that what I view as an overemphasis on stuff which is not, per se, funny or worthwhile takes up screen time which could have been used rather better.Because this is a funny film, frequently laugh-out-loud funny. There are funny lines, characters, situations, sight gags – I laughed out loud. Yes it's gross, but you go in knowing that (you also go in knowing about the language and dope, to be fair).

17,anaconda-40658,All Stuffing No Substance.,5,13 July 2015,"Ted 2 (2015): Dir: Seth MacFarlane / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Amanda Seyfried, Jessica Barth, Giovanni Ribisi / Voice: Seth MacFarlane: Disappointing sequel to the innovative crude 2012 comedy hit. What really knocks the stuffings out of this tripe is the fact that John Bennett, played by Mark Wahlberg, is now divorced. Due to Mila Kunis being pregnant Seth MacFarlane wrote her out in a method that renders everything fought for in the first film a waste. Teddy bear Ted gets married to the hick mannered Tami-Lynn in an effective opening. They eventually fall into routine and start fighting until Ted suggest they have a baby. All is fine until Ted needs a donor. Sam Jones passes, and attempting to masturbate Tom Brady in his sleep is met with disaster. John offers to donate, which leads to a scene at the clinic where he ends up dosed in semen. A civil rights theme surfaces where Ted is viewed as property as oppose to a person. This costs him his job and possibly his marriage, leading to a lousy road trip and a predictable conclusion. While Ted is an effective comedic creation voiced by MacFarlane, the payoff is far from funny. Wahlberg still holds strong standing by Ted through this trial. Amanda Seyfried as their lawyer and romantic interest to Bennett is a complete waste and a reminder why viewers will miss Kunis. Jessica Barth as Tami-Lynn is thankfully given more to do as she stands by her bear. Giovanni Ribisi returns as a janitor for a toy company. This is the most unnecessary character in the entire film. While the civil rights theme is strong, its laughs are far and few leaving audiences with nothing but stuffing. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Ted 2

But that was because it was just veering on the edge of offensive, never going overboard with all the offensive humour that some people think is the height of hilarity.Now, while this sequel is funny in parts, MacFarlane has appeared to have sold out and gone full on offensive with his humour, because the majority of the jokes in this, are aimed at ethnicities, and culture, and there is one long running joke throughout the film, which involves Google, that is just plain embarrassing.Like Family Guy though, the really funny parts are just random scenes that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story or narrative, such as Jay Leno walking out of a bathroom, or Liam Neesons scene, which is the best thing about the film.Wahlberg is as good as he was in the first, even though it looks like he is overdoing it as times, to get those extra laughs. It's Seyfried though, who really stands out in this. The running joke of her not getting pop culture references is pretty genius, and shows that MacFarlane can make his cast feel comfortable being self deprecating.After the disaster of A Million Ways To Die In The West, this did feel like it was made to cash in on its success, and while at times it did, it's still a worthy sequel, with lots of laughs.Just next time, lay off the racist humour Seth.",Ted 2
19,mm-39,More sick over the top humour!,6,28 June 2015,"More sick over the top humour! If you loved Ted you will feel the same about Ted 2. The same on the mark stereo-typed dysfunctional character driven humour. Seth creates uncomfortable sick humour which intertwines with a dysfunctional character driven story. The story and events are weak. Looking at the Ted series, one has to view the genre as if one is watching the movie Porky's. There is a social message, mixed in with fluff. The original Ted is better because of the famous Flash Gordon scene, and the over the top poo beginning. My wife almost peed her pants laughing at Ted 2 though. I wonder how as political correctness marches on what people will think of Ted 2 years from now? I believe Ted 2 will either be tame or too offensive. 6 or 7 out of 10!",Ted 2
20,namashi_1,"Fun, but not as good as the first!",6,21 July 2015,"A sequel to the flat-out-hilarious Ted, 'Ted 2' is a fairly funny sequel, but its not good as the first one. Reason? The concept of the teddy bear's pursuit to get the status of being a person isn't interesting enough & even otherwise, we had a great teddy bear movie before. 'Ted 2' Synopsis: Newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law.'Ted 2' isn't boring, its actually pretty funny & some sequences left me in splits. This isn't a bad prequel from any angle, but the problem is, it isn't close to its highly enjoyable prequel. Seth MacFarlane has made a good attempt to extend his teddy bear adventure into a franchise, but its his own Screenplay, also Co-Written by Wellesley Wild & Alec Sulkin, that wears out after a point. The jokes do work, but only to a point. MacFarlane's Direction is decent. But his Writing needed to be better! Performance-Wise: The Bromance between MacFarlane's Ted & Mark Wahlberg is still intact. The Bromance is undoubtedly the highpoint of the enterprise, as both MacFarlane & Wahlberg are simply fantastic in their respective parts. Its also nice to see the beautiful Amanda Seyfried join them. Giovanni Ribisi returns as the bad-guy, but he's monotonous. Morgan Freeman shines in a cameo. On the whole, 'Ted 2' does have its moments, but not enough to be recommended strongly.",Ted 2
21,StevePulaski,"The strengths are in the banter and the chemistry, not the sight-gags",6,28 June 2015,"A handful of names in show business divide people so strongly and Seth MacFarlane is one of them. His pop culture references, his often scatological and vulgar humor, and the simultaneous repetition and aimlessness in his stories have made him the subject of a great deal of hate. Since I began watching ""Family Guy"" at a young age, I've always admired MacFarlane's ability to turn nothing into something, taking the most ridiculous and baseless ideas for plots and balancing the right amount of out of place jokes, in ""Family Guy""'s case, cutaway gags, with some coherent sense of plot progression. Love him or hate him, that kind of ability isn't seen often because it's a difficult thing to pull off.MacFarlane's films are a different breed, however; they are much longer than a twenty-two minute episode, and with each one just hairs away from the two hour mark, it's understandable to see why many tire of his schtick and view his films as endurance tests. What can work in twenty-two minutes doesn't necessarily pan out to a successful two hour venture. MacFarlane's directorial debut in film was ""Ted,"" a film that struck lightning in a bottle, combining the strong tendencies of MacFarlane incorporating chemistry, ribald humor, and romance all in one film, sort of adhering to the likes of contemporaries like Judd Apatow. It was an uproariously funny film; one that shows the strengths of MacFarlane's zaniness and Mark Wahlberg's talent in comedy.With ""Ted"" becoming the highest-grossing R-rated comedy, a franchise was immediately born, and ""Ted 2"" is a film that is obviously birthed from extreme financial success. MacFarlane likely had little to no inkling that this character would go on to sustain another film, so the very fact that he penned another adventure for his foul-mouthed bear character is quite the feat. The issue, however, is that while the first film held ground as consistently funny, ""Ted 2"" is more infrequently funny, concerned with loud comedic sight-gags and gross-out events instead of focusing on the chemistry.We refocus on John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking stuffed teddy bear Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane), this time, watching Ted and his longtime girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) marry one another before all their friends. John is broken up over his recent divorce with Lori, and Ted's persistent encouragement of him to stop watching and meticulously organizing his porn and get back out in the dating game doesn't seem to work.Upon revealing to Tami-Lynn that he wants to have a baby, Ted discovers from the state of Massachusetts that he is not a legal citizen because he is property, not an actual person. As a result, Ted is fired from his job, his marriage is annulled, and he feels like a subhuman no matter where he goes. In efforts to fight back, John and Ted hire Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), a young lawyer about to embark on her first case to grant Ted his civil rights.""Ted 2,"" similar to ""Ted,"" is overstuffed with content, jokes, characters, and situational humor, so much so that the film seems like an overstuffed teddy bear, at any point ready to burst at its seems from the weight and pressure of all its contents. Much like its predecessor, ""Ted 2"" is at its funniest when John and Ted are simply slumming on the couch, exchanging insults, playing pranks on one another, or sharing a heart-to-heart. Consider the scene where Sam speaks to a civil rights attorney (Morgan Freeman) on the phone whilst John and Ted fight over the last Bud Light in the fridge.Scenes like that are glimmers of humor in a film that occasionally finds itself too obsessed with overblown scenes, like the fairly obvious one at a sperm bank or the ridiculous and ostensibly neverending chase sequence at Comic-Con. One of the film's subplots, which revolves around the janitor for Hasbro attempting to steal Ted so he can figure out how to make hundreds of talking bears like him, is incredibly anticlimactic when it arrives at its conclusion, and the film is littered with stunt casting the likes of Liam Neeson, Tom Brady, Dennis Haysbert, and Morgan Freeman that it's a wonder if the film is confident in its main characters to sustain a film. Finally, the absence of Mila Kunis in the film isn't a total loss, for Seyfried comes with just enough personality to sustain the supporting role. Save for some strangely placed scenes, like her song as her, John, and Ted sit in a marijuana farm, and Seyfried is actually a pleasant addition to the film.""Ted 2"" has some hilarious one-liners, but the chemistry between John and Ted is the real reason for seeing the film. There is an undeniable aura of positivity throughout this whole film, one that MacFarlane predicates on top of engulfing the film with loud performances and constant efforts to make the audience laugh. With all the jokes and antics that occur in this film, it's only expected many miss, and MacFarlane proves that even if he isn't on stage, he's still breaking a sweat with all that he does in his projects.",Ted 2
22,DKosty123,Comedy Timing Is Everything,7,27 December 2015,"A comedy film relies on timing as well as gags. I watched the unrated version of this film so I am not sure how much different my viewing is from the theater experience. One thing I already knew was I saw the original Ted in the theater and then the DVD. You gotta give the people what they expect, and the unrated Ted 2 does that.The major cast change from the first film is Mila Kunis is gone and replaced by Jessica Barth who along with Amanda Seyfried both represent bleached blonde's throwing curves quite nicely. This movie adds Morgan Freeman as a high power civil rights lawyer in one of his less serious roles to good effect.It brings up the issue from America's Civil War - is a living being a person or property no matter what their form. This could get even more profound in the future as Computer's like IBM's Watson could challenge if a machine could be considered a being, like Hal was in 2001 A Space - but reading too much into this concept is not what this film is made for.This film is made for fun and put your brain away throw away lines. On this level it succeeds. How many movies can literally-(1) Drain Tom Brady's Balls. (2) Destroy a sperm donor bank(3) Marry a Ted Bear to a bleached blonde(4) Prove that Drugs can provide a woman birth control?Well, so much for those things. There are some gags here that work well and some that do not. At least it does not feature nude men wrestling like Borat. There are some standards here.",Ted 2
23,Hellmant,Not nearly as consistently funny as the original!,7,1 July 2015,"'TED 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit comedy flick 'TED'; about a kid's teddy bear that comes to life, and never leaves his side (well into the child's adulthood). This sequel finds the two best friends in relationship trouble; as Ted also must prove he's a person, in court, in order to adopt a child. The film was once again directed and co-written by Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane also co-stars in the movie (as the voice of the teddy bear, once again); he wrote the script with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild (the same trio also wrote the original 'TED', 'A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST' and multiple episodes of 'FAMILY GUY'). Mark Wahlberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Barth, Patrick Warburton and Sam J. Jones all reprise their roles from the original film, as well; they're joined this time around by Amanda Seyfried, Morgan Freeman and Michael Dorn. The film isn't nearly as consistently funny as the original, but it does have a few really good laughs. As the movie opens, Ted is marrying his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn (Barth). John (Wahlberg) has been depressed and addicted to porn; ever since he divorced Lori, six months earlier. Ted and Tami-Lynn start having relationship drama, as well, and Ted thinks that if the two have a baby, it will solve all of their problems. After John agrees to donate sperm for the pregnancy, due to the fact that Ted has no penis, Tami-Lynn also learns she's infertile. The two decide to adopt, when they learn that Ted is still considered property, in the eyes of the law; and therefore he can't legally be a father or a husband. They hire a lawyer, named Samantha Leslie Jackson (Seyfried), to prove Ted's a person, in court.I've mostly been impressed with MacFarlane's movies so far; I like the original 'TED', a lot, and I even enjoyed 'A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST'. I think 'FAMILY GUY' is really hit-and-miss, but I am a mild fan of that show, as well. I also thought MacFarlane did an awesome job hosting the Oscars. So I'm pretty disappointed by this film! Most of the ideas, in the movie, are pretty humorous, and the jokes probably sounded hilarious on paper; but a lot of the delivery is horrible. Most jokes fall pretty flat! I think it's largely due to MacFarlane's directing; the film's pacing is pretty bad as well. Some jokes are hilarious though, and the acting is all pretty good. The film is also really bold and edgy, like all of MacFarlane's work; you have to give it credit for that. It's a pretty flawed sequel, but it does have plenty of moments.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N95IMM6Vork",Ted 2
24,thesar-2,"Trix are for Kids, Ted is for Adults",7,28 June 2015,"Seriously. When are comedy sequels EVER better than the original? If you'd count Lethal Weapon 2 as a comedy, then that might be the exception. But, since it's not, the streak remains. That said, this film cracked me up from beginning to end. Though, some jokes didn't work, and some were only funny the first 2 of 10 times – seen a black cock lately? – and the movie was far too long, for the majority, it worked as an excellent supplement to the original, which I'll always laugh out loud with. And the human rights plot – how perfectly it fit with the release date, June 26, 2015the same day the Supreme Court ruled in favor of human rights to gays and lesbians and marriage. Well played, Ted. Well played. * * *Final thoughts: Of course, two different couples brought their 4-8 year olds into see this movie. Egad. Liam Neeson said it best, well, summed up: Trix are for kids, Ted is for adults, you idiots.",Ted 2

26,Robert_duder,Simply builds on how bad the first one was,4,8 August 2015,"When the first Ted came out everyone raved about how funny it was. I knew it would be dirty but sometimes a dirty comedy still pulls off funny although I'm not a fan of the stupid crude humour that has taken over ""comedies"" in the new millennium. I was willing to give Ted a chance and...I was wrong...or right. It was dumb. Really, really dumb and dirty and pointless despite an attempt at a heartfelt story. Still, I wouldn't be a movie buff if I didn't try and watch the second film. Ted fans will be happy to know that nothing has changed only the story is even weaker than it was before. This is a poor excuse at doing it all again because fans wanted it. I would even say it isn't as raunchy as the original but it is the same tired jokes, pot smoking and lame storyline. Macfarlane is so much better than this but it feels rushed like they didn't want to do it but were forced to. At least in the first film there was a genuine feeling of camaraderie between Ted and John but that magic just isn't there this time around. The sequel actually makes me appreciate the first film more and I didn't like it either.Mark Wahlberg is a great actor, Hollywood gold and he is good at comedy especially when he's doing satire so this should work well for him but his heart isn't in it this time. He isn't likable and he deserves better character development than this. Seth Macfarlane created an adult legend in the foul mouthed, pot smoking Teddy bear. Ted had his fans but this just didn't add anything to the character. A sequel can't just be the same thing again, it has to add something new to the story and Ted 2 did not do that at all. Amanda Seyfried is a bizarre addition to the cast. She sticks out in this cast, seems ridiculous and her and Wahlberg have zero chemistry. I don't think Mila Kunis was amazing or anything in the first one but compared to Seyfried, she was Oscar worthy. Jessica Barth is forgettable as Ted's wife. They have a few amusing confrontations together but she doesn't do much else. Giovanni Ribisi returns as our villain and he does alright. Its a pretty typical role for Ribisi but it works well for him.I would have expected Seth Macfarlane to at least bring the character back and put his all into it since he is the creator, writer and director and stars in it. Maybe the film was victim to cuts and editing ordered by the studio but either way this film lacks a lot. It seems to be liked by fans equally but it didn't bring in near the money and I can understand why. I know I'm a bit harsh on comedies because I have an expectation of smart comedy and this is as dumb as it comes. But it lacked in so many spots, even more than the first and it didn't even have the same heart or dumb likability. I would never purposely sit through either film again but especially this one. 4/10",Ted 2
27,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Superior to a lot of comedy sequels, but not without it's flaws",7,28 July 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ted has married his trashy girlfriend Tami Lyn (Jessica Barth) and they have now settled down together- but not in to wedded bliss, what with one thing and another. But then Ted settles on the idea of having a baby, with best friend John (Mark Whalberg) acting as a surrogate father. But then Ted learns that he is not legally considered a person under the law, barring him from adoption rights, his right to work, or even to enjoy basic human rights. It all leads to a courtroom battle involving recently graduated lawyer Samantha (Amanda Seyfried), while the creepy Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) returns, hatching a plan with a slimy toy manufacturer (John Carroll Lynch) to make Ted a brand.We've certainly been assaulted with an onslaught of comedy sequels lately (Horrible Bosses 2, Dumb and Dumber To, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, and probably some more) and the quality has pretty much without exception not been anywhere near the standards of the originals. And so into this midst, the patently inevitable Ted 2 strolls, with Seth MacFarlene back at the helm. This, as history should have taught us, is not a cast iron guarantee of quality, and while Ted 2 is a cut above a lot of what we've seen lately, it still isn't quite as good as the original.MacFarlene has injected an even more merciless politically incorrect streak in to proceedings with this outing, with some of the gags really making you feel uneasy and affecting how you'll be able to laugh at them. It challenges your offence threshold, and what you might think is acceptable to the eye and mind. Somehow, this time around, the whole absurdity of the premise is a little harder to take as a grown adult too, for some reason, and basic human logic starts niggling at your mind. But the ludicrousness also provides some of the best laughs in the script, not necessarily from the Ted character, but some of the situations he's in. The trouble is, by the end, it's all become so drawn out, with the whole back story of Ted's quest to be treated as human causing an unnecessary distraction and detracting from the main farce.It's all pretty much as good as can be expected, with some laugh out loud moments of joy (but oddly no fart jokes), but also a little tasteless and uneasy in parts, and also a little blindsided by ambition. ***",Ted 2

29,bowmanblue,Am I weird in that I enjoyed this one more than the last?,8,21 July 2015,"I've been a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane's 'Family Guy' ever since it aired, so I was delighted when he made 'Ted' – the tale of a foul-mouthed (but lovable) teddy bear who came to life for no real reason. And, it seemed that the majority of cinema-goers agreed with me. Ted was a massive hit and, I suppose in Hollywood terms, that means that a sequel is inevitable.So, the – not that imaginatively-titled – 'Ted 2' was born. And, from what I gathered, reviews were mixed. Most said that it was 'okay' – pointing out that there are parts that make you laugh, but long areas where the jokes get a little thin. Others said that it was just a 're-tread' of the first one and not original enough to warrant being a classic in its own right.Now, I loved the original. I laughed all the way through, so perhaps – because if the lukewarm reviews part 2 was receiving – I went into the cinema with low expectations. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps I should have watched the original just before the sequel – that way I could compare which one I laughed more in. Granted, I haven't seen the first one for a year or so, but I found I was actually laughing more in the second one than I did in the first! Mark Wahlberg returns for the sequel and, not being one to take comedic roles that often, again does well to get the laughs. Especially when he's opposite the 'true' star of the film – the computer-generated furry bear himself, Ted (voiced in the style of Family Guy's Peter Griffin by Seth MacFarlane). The only notable absence from the cast list is Mila Kurnis, who was unable to reprise her role as Wahlberg's love interest due to her real-life pregnancy. She's replaced by Amanda Seyfried who does well to 'airdrop' herself into the mix as a blatant replacement love interest.Yes, there's not an awful lot of 'plot, character development, or storyline,' but the jokes do come thick and fast. Basically, if you like Family Guy (or should I say Family Guy's irreverent and often adult and vulgar!) humour, then you should already have seen Ted and therefore should appreciate its sequel. If you're not really sure of the 'tone' of the film and whether you'll like it, I suggest you look up clips of either Family Guy or Ted online and see if you'll go for this particular brand of humour.Don't be too swayed by the negative reviews. Perhaps you should allow yourself to lower your expectations as I did and find yourself pleasantly surprised? Maybe if I watched the original again I'd realise that it was in fact superior, but, I'm happy to have Ted back and I think that it makes a great compendium piece.",Ted 2
30,ThomasDrufke,Thunder Buddies For Life,7,24 December 2015,"I'm not a huge fan of comedy sequels, they rarely ever work, but having Patrick Stewart narrate and centering the third act of your film at comic-con, gives you an immediate advantage. The first Ted film was great. It was a stoner comedy without Rogen that actually works really well. Seth MacFarlane's humor isn't the easiest to accept at times, but in these films it seems to hit all the right spots. But why even do a sequel? Sure making 500 million warrants at least an attempt, but did the story even remotely call for another story with these guys? Not at all. With that said, MacFarlane found a way to bring these characters back...and pretty much make the same exact film. Maybe not as identical plot points as both the Jump Street films, but the story beats are very similar for the two Ted films, which can sometimes be to its detriment.Even with all of that, I really enjoyed Ted 2. There are still plenty of laughs to be had. Not only does MacFarlane include timely cameos from famous people, including Liam Neeson and Tom Brady, but the jokes hit more often than not. The funniest of the film's gags centers around a google search that still has me giggling a day later. I would almost go as far as saying some of the laughs surpass even the heights of the first film.The problem is that the story isn't fresh at all. It echoes all the same plot points as the first Ted, including the unbearable character that Giovanni Ribisi plays. Mila Kunis isn't in it, which does at times feel strange and even jarring at first, but I think Amanda Seyfried's new dynamic with the duo was good enough to keep the film going. But Kunis' absence may leave fans feeling indifferent about the story.In all, Ted's pursuit of being a 'human' surpassed my expectations of it being a comedy sequel even if the story is a near rehash of the first film. The second half relies too heavily on the gags of the first and it does run probably 15 minutes too long, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had here.+Cameos+Plenty of funny gags+Comic Con setting-Story is nothing new-Ribisi's annoying character7.6/10",Ted 2
31,lesleyharris30,"Ignore the Critics, Fans of the Original will be Delighted,",9,24 July 2015,"Ted 2 is a fantastic film with a very well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. I am a huge fan of the first Ted, and I found this to be very entertaining. If you are a Seth MacFarlane fan you will surely be pleased, the comedy is still great, I do not think I went through a single scene without laughing at least twice. One thing I think this movie was missing that is very evident in the first one is Mark Wahlberg being in the lead role. Ted is the main character now, which is fine, it makes sense, but I felt it was more relatable and funny to watch when we are seeing a real person dealing with this talking teddy bear, instead of just seeing him in a supporting role, though Wahlberg does still bring in a terrific comedic performance. The chemistry between all the cast members is fantastic. The strange, albeit beautiful connection between Wahlberg and a CGI bear is still evident, which is always a joy. I was a bit skeptical at first that Mila Kunis was not in it, but Amanda Seyfried helped me forget about her, delivering the most impressive performance that I have seen from her in a comedy role. The film is also jam packed with many great cameos that are sure to delight and surprise. It is certainly not as good as the original Ted, but I do not think fans will walk out disappointed, and I would recommend Ted 2 to anyone looking for a good comedy.

I felt like joining the crowd like seriously!I was so so relieved that Mark Walberg's character didn't die, otherwise the film would be screwed on having him just be killed off.

37,ironhorse_iv,"The verdict is in, for this movie. Ted 2 was just alright.",7,1 July 2015,"I like to make a motion, your honor. I have to object to the claims, the prosecutor is calling this, a dumb comedy. It comes to my belief; that this comedy isn't as dumb as it looks. Amid all the crude humor that Ted 2 has, the movie does have a somewhat smart premise. While, it does go a little overboard in being serious. The movie puts out some good sly commentary on America's history of marginalizing people for being different. While, a lot of people might find this, unappealing, because they wanted to see a silly comedy. I kinda like comedies that kinda take a risk in, putting out a social message. This movie does bring up a nifty question: what makes a person, a person? Questions like are we only a person, if we show empathy? Do we need to have to be responsible in the world and give something back? Or do we simply need to show love? Directed by Seth MacFarlane, the sequel to 2012's Ted, tries to solve this, by showing that Ted (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane), a teddy bear that came to live in the first movie, is self-aware, feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Still, based on the law, Ted is deem property, and denied access to the same rights as human beings. In a quest to redeem his civil rights, Ted must seek justice, and fight for the right to live. Without spoiling the movie too much, the wanting to be human trial plot reminds me so, 1999's Bicentennial Man in its approach. I heard that the plot was born out of Seth MacFarlane reading John Jakes' Civil War novels on the side while filming 2014's A Million Ways to die in the West. It replaced his original Smokey and the Bandit (1977)-esque plot of Ted and John (Mark Walhberg) driving a large shipment of marijuana cross-country, which he had to scrap after 2013's We're the Millers came out. As much as I like the trial, I would rather have the whole Smokey and the Bandit premise, even if it's a little far-fetch from reality. I have to say, while, the first movie, made a lot of money, Ted 2 didn't felt like a blatant cash-in, sequel. A lot of work, went into this film. The movie kinda works. It had enough satire, pop culture references, gross humor, dark humor to make me, very entertain. All the humor hit the funny bone. There were only a few that were misses. Still, some of the jokes do look like they were rehash for this film. A lot of them, came from old Family Guy's skits, like for example, the song that Ted sings to prove he has ""soul"", is the same one Brian Griffin sang in Family Season 5, Episode 7, ""Brian the Bachelor"". Because of that, Ted 2 felt like a series of skits, woven together than real film. The movie really needs an editor, as I felt like the movie was a little too long. Honestly, did we really need the weed farm sequence, the road trip or the part where unneeded supporting characters, Rick (Michael Dorn) and Guy (Patrick Warburton) bully the Comic Con nerds? It didn't match with the rest of the film. It had no pay off. It felt like time waster filler. Another thing, I didn't like, about this film is the whole Hasbro is evil, sub-plot. It wasn't needed. If you want to technically, based on the story, Hasbro did create Ted, but they don't theoretically own Ted; Johnny (Mark Walberg) does. So it doesn't make any sense. I don't understand, why Hasbro agree to have their product placement in this film. It makes their company look really bad. Companies like Hasbro, wasn't the only thing, making cameos in the film. Famous people also pitched in. I have to say, the movie was a bit cameo heavy. Tom Brady, Sam Jones, Liam Neeson, and Jay Leno were all good, but some of them, were very pointless and wasn't needed. The main cast was pretty well-rounded, with Seth and Mark, bringing back the laughs as the Thunder Buddies. As lovable as these guys are, they don't model behavior that's worth emulating. I kinda miss, Mila Kunis as Lori Collins. She was the most grounded character in the first movie. Mila Kunis could not reprise her role of Lori because she was pregnant with her baby with partner Ashton Kutcher. Her lack of presence was very alarming. I don't know, why they couldn't write in, that she was pregnant. I hate that her character divorce Johnny. It made the whole premise of the first movie, very pointless as the character of Johnny is shown, haven't really growing up. It kinda ruins the original film. I have to say, Amanda Seyfried as her replacement, was alright as the love-interest. I didn't mind, her character, Samuel L. Jackson. I just wish, they didn't bring back, Jessica Barth. I was never a huge fan of her character, Tammi-Lynn in the first movie. Her character is very off-putting, and for them to add more scenes with her, in this movie was nearly unwatchable. Giovanni Ribisi reprises his role as the villain, Donny. He was fun to watch, but I really didn't think, his character was needed. Like I said about the original movie, this movie shouldn't be, mistaken for a kid's movie. It's very vulgar, filled with foul language and sexual innuendo. Jokes are funny, but it's not too mean-spirited. Not as much shock value as the first movie. It's pretty tame compare to the television shows that Seth MacFarlane created such as Family Guy, American Dad and Cleveland Show. Overall: The movie does a good job at being a sequel, but there were some questionable material that was spread a little too long. It takes itself, a little too serious at times, but in the end, it's fun to watch. Do recommended.",Ted 2
38,The-Sarkologist,Ted wants a baby,7,26 June 2015,"The thing about Ted is that as soon as that teddy bear opens his mouth the first thought that comes into my mind is Peter Griffin, which is not surprising considering MacFarlane does the voices for both characters. Anyway, since I quite enjoyed the first movie when I discovered that he had made a sequel I knew that it was one of those films that was going to give me some good laughs, and I must say that it certainly didn't disappoint. Okay, it is basically more of the same, but then sometimes doing what one does best is the only way to go, and having been a fan of Family Guy, I pretty much knew what I was going to expect.Once again we have a flow of big name stars making appearances, including Liam Neeson in his Taken role coming into the grocery store to buy a packet of children's cereal, but making sure nobody actually knows that he is buying it. While I thought that was quite amusing the one scene that simply sticks in my mind was when they went into the lawyer's office and the lawyer pulls out a bong and starts smoking it, puts it down and says 'I hope you don't mind'. That was so absurd that I simply cannot believe it ever happening, but the fact that it did makes me give this movie the stars that it deserves. Anyway, I feel that I might end up giving away too many of the jokes, so I will simply say 'help me home', and if you are wondering what I mean by that, then go an see the movie and you will understand.Anyway, Ted gets married, but it turns out that after about six months (I believe) they are starting to have problems, so it is suggested that they have a child. Unfortunately Ted just doesn't have the equipment, and his wife, having been a coke fiend, can't have children, so they decide to adopt. Unfortunately the state decides that Ted isn't actually a human, he is property, so he can't adopt, which results in him being stripped of all of his rights, which is why he lands up in a lawyers office – he wants his rights back and wants to be considered a sentient human like everybody else.Anyway, I don't really want to go much deeper than that because while there is the idea about being considered a human, and the still simmering issue of race in America, this film is basically all about having a laugh at a couple of really obnoxious and dope smoking losers (though I must admit that Whalberg does a brilliant job in this film – as he did in the last; I still can't believe that this was the guy who was the lead singer of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch). Along with the laughs the film does force you to think about the issue of race and the fact that not too long ago the same argument was being made about the status of the African American.",Ted 2
39,Reno-Rangan,The return wasn't as exciting as the previous one.,6,24 December 2015,"No surprise why this film failed to excite me, but a few people thinks its a passable sequel. The original movie was atypical, so the success followed it. In my perspective better that should have left as a one-off movie. But as a low budget product, they knew it was going grab back twice, thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first film's influence.There is no story, simply based on the usual Hollywood road adventure like the flicks 'Fanboys', 'Dumb and Dumber To', 'Not Suitable for Children' et cetera, except the character Ted which makes this theme a special. A couple of good jokes and that's it, the rest were ineffective, sometime keep repeating the same ones. The 2 hours in a too plain concept, is way too long to sit and watch/focus.The cameos were weak, or maybe worthless/meaningless, especially Liam Neeson's. The best things were the production quality, acting and like I mentioned before, the character Ted. For the one time watch, I think kind of manageable, but definitely not suitable for repeat viewing or to recommend it to the others. But overall, a little disappointed with the outcome. They have got one more chance to end this franchise on a high note as a decent trilogy if the next film gets a better storyline.6/10",Ted 2
40,tomgillespie2002,"Messy, vulgar and unfunny",3,24 January 2016,"While I wouldn't exactly call Seth MacFarlane's live-action debut Ted (2012) a pleasant surprise, it was still slightly better than I expected. It took a relatively original idea, built it around the story of a man who refused to grow up, and delivered a few laughs along the way. The film's box-office success cemented the need for a sequel, and the original idea was to have Ted (voiced by McFarlane in a thick Boston accent) and best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) road trip across America with a van full of weed. But when they realised this was the story of We're the Millers (2013), the plan had to change.Instead of the road trip we are given a half-baked and borderline offensive civil rights allegory, which never settles on how and when it should get to the point. With John now divorced from Mila Kunis's character from the first movie, he cannot help but feel lonely as he watches his friend Ted marry his girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). Soon into the marriage, they are bickering like an old couple, and decide that the only way to repair things is to have a baby. However, due to the fact that Ted lacks reproductive organs, they opt for a sperm donor. With Sam J. Jones running low and a failed attempt to steal NFL star Tom Brady's seemingly sacred juice, along with the discovery that Tami-Lynn's years of drug abuse have left her infertile, they choose instead to adopt.It is at this point that Ted is flagged by the government having previously ducking under their radar. Declared an item of property as opposed to an actual person, Ted has his marriage annulled, loses his job, and has every legal right he thought he once had taken from him. Seeking legal aid, Ted and John turn to rookie lawyer Samantha L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), a fellow pot-head who agrees to work the case pro bono. Meanwhile, Ted's nemesis Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), now working as a janitor for Ted's manufacturer Hasbro, looks to exploit this opening the law and convinces his boss Tom Jessup (John Carroll Lynch) to let him steal Ted back in order to open him up and see how he works, with the hope of making a fortune in allowing every child to own their own Ted.The main problem with Ted 2 is that the comedy just seems off. Often seeking to simply out-gross anything that came before like the wave of comedies that hit the big screen in the wake of There's Something About Mary's success in the late 90's and early 2000's, the film is also peppered with pop-culture references with the running joke that Samantha L. Jackson doesn't even know who Samuel L. Jackson is. Conversations are often so vulgar that it's difficult to feel sympathy for Ted, who is voiced without any trace of charm or cuteness by MacFarlane. At almost two hours, it also drags, dipping in and out of the main plot thread without any care for narrative flow. I did laugh during Ted 2 - a cameo from Jay Leno and a Jurassic Park nod in particular - but this is a messy, often outright unfunny experience.",Ted 2
41,Thanos_Alfie,Funny but not as good as the first...,5,21 February 2019,"""Ted 2"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie and the sequel of the movie ""Ted"" in which we watch Ted and Tami-Lynn getting married. In the meantime, they want to have a baby but they find many obstacles in front. The most serious obstacle is that the government does not recognize Ted as a person but as a property. So, Ted has to prove in court that he is a person in order to be allowed to have a child.I liked this movie and I had a really great time watching it but since I had already watched the first movie I expected more for the second. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as the first and it had some boring moments and some others that didn't make any sense of having them. The direction which was made again by Seth MacFarlane was very interesting and it combined very well for one more time comedy with romance and comedy with drama. About the interpretations, I enjoyed for one more time the interpretation of Mark Wahlberg who played as John Bennett and Seth MacFarlane's voice as Ted. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jessica Barth's who played as Tami-Lynn, Giovanni Ribisi's who played for one more time as Donny and Morgan Freeman's who played as Patrick Meighan. I expected more from Amanda Seyfried who played as Samantha and I believe that she didn't reach her potential with her interpretation in this movie.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Ted 2"" is a funny movie with many humorous moments but it's not as good as the first movie. Despite that I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to have a lot of fun and you are going to laugh a lot. If you have already watched the first movie then it would be better not to expect from it to be as good as the first, if you are prepared about it then you are going to like it very much too.",Ted 2
42,zkonedog,"Novelty Is Gone, But Still A Few Good Laughs",6,27 February 2017,"The original ""Ted"" was one of the most unique movies I had ever seen...and also one of the best movies I saw in 2012. I was a fan of the Family Guy-style humor, as well as the fact that a movie about a living stuffed bear could make me both laugh and feel. Unfortunately, this sequel (while still providing a number of good laughs) just couldn't live up to its predecessor in any category.For a basic plot summary, ""Ted 2"" resumes the life stories of Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and John (Mark Wahlberg) and their crazy antics. Ted is now married to fellow cashier Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and they want to have a ""little Teddy"" running around. However, after the obvious insemination difficulties (!), they are stymied further when Ted is ruled ""property"" by the government. The gang decide to fight the case and are assigned Samantha L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) as the junior lawyer hoping to make a mark in her career by winning the case.The obvious issue with this movie is that the novelty has worn off. In the first film, McFarlane could practically get by with the sight gag of a talking teddy bear. That is no longer the case now, with this next film having to rely solely on the humor. Much like ""Family Guy"", which is now almost completely in the tank (its comedy has dried up), ""Ted 2"" can't sustain nearly two hours on straight comedy alone. With the novelty gone, it turns into more of a generic, run-of-the-mill comedic effort.Another weakness is that the role Mila Kunis played in part one is not present here. Seyfried brings her own style to the proceedings this time, don't get me wrong, but there was a better chemistry between Kunis, Wahlberg, and MacFarlane. Again, though, perhaps that is just as much because the story is more original in that original film.All of that being said, ""Ted 2"" still managed to provide me with enough laughs to give it a decent three-star ranking. Had it not started off so terribly slow (after nearly 30 minutes, I was worried it was going to be a completely unfunny disaster), it could have even been bumped a tad higher. Unless a really original, groundbreaking script surfaces for this franchise/characters, it is likely that this will and should be the last installment in the adventures of our furry friend. I would probably see a third one...but with extremely lowered expectations.",Ted 2
43,Floated2,Full on laughs,7,29 October 2017,"Ted 2 was not as well received from critics and fans compared to Ted. This film is still quite funny with Seth MacFarlane's typical sense of humor using clever witty one-liners or cutaways with his typical musical dance screens which is often used. Although Ted 2 may not be as good as the original, since this film is a little more depressing and light hearted, the plot is still well and the overall film is very much enjoyable and entertaining. The cast along with the supporting character all work well, as this film does not feel as long as its runtime (a little under 1 hour 50 minutes excluding end credits). Overall Ted 2 is still quite funny with many clever jokes and the chemistry between Ted and Mark Wahlberg's character is what makes the film good.As a rewatch 06/08/20' Ted 2 is as good as remembered if not a little better. This is much of the same of the original, though just a slight decline. Not as much worse as some people claim. Perhaps a little more offensive is a reason as to some people being off put.",Ted 2
44,eddie_baggins,Laughs can still be found in this overlong follow up,6,30 June 2015,"His certainly not a cuddly teddy that's for all but after one seriously successful first outing in 2012 it was always a given that everyone's (the only one?) favourite foul mouthed yet somehow endearing talking bear was going to make it back to a big screen close by and with that we now have Ted 2.After his biggest misfire yet in the potentially hilarious yet wrongly skewed A Million Ways to Die in the West (of which an alumni of makes a great cameo in this film), Seth MacFarlane finds himself back on familiar ground, which is in both a material sense, a comedic sense and also a still unfortunately self-indulgent directional sense that see's MacFarlane struggle to rid his 2 hour plus film of jokes that don't work and plot lines that feel like nothing more than time fillers. If there was ever a director in need of someone to cull his films of material that neither enhance or contribute to the tale at hand it's MacFarlane but to say the man doesn't deliver some comedic gold in this enjoyable romp would be a lie.While you'll often find yourself ashamed at what brings forth fits of laughter here, MacFarlane as he is well known to do, mixes juvenile humour with far more wide reaching topical funnies, from everything from civil rights through to his usual pop culture insights, nothing is out of his reach. Within the films bloated runtime there are moments of pure gold that make Ted 2 succeed to the level it does, much like its predecessor and with the continued chemistry shared between Whalberg's well-meaning yet daft John and the MacFarlane voiced Ted Clubber-Lang (yes Ted now has a last name) at the same high levels the films many sins can be forgiven thanks to their often game saving banters. The addition of Amanda Seyfried is also a bonus to the film, her willingness to poke fun at herself a particular highlight.The narrative of Ted 2 is anything but fantastic and the reappearance of Giovani Ribisi's teddy obsessed villain Donny is almost a movie breaker but Ted 2 has enough wit and chemistry to save itself from all the low denominator humour and awkwardly edited grove that surrounds it and in the end provides some very decent comedic entertainment. In saying this it may be time for all involved to move onto other things with MacFarlane in particular in need of something a little meatier than he has been dishing up over the last few years.3 Tom Brady home invasions out of 5",Ted 2
45,pennyelenabooks,not good enough,3,16 August 2015,"Ted is trying to prove in court that he is a person and not property. Like many many other sequels that follow successful movies, Ted 2 is disappointing. Think dump and dumper to. The story is just too boring, and you can guess what'll happen next way too easily. And its a pity cause it does start well and promising. The jokes about pop culture and their lawyer's ignorance of it get tiring after a while repeating them and they are not the ones being repeated. The movie repeats pretty much the whole story of the first one with the villain trying to get his hands on Ted. The addition of some action does not add anything to the movie, that simply fails to entertain.",Ted 2
46,filipemanuelneto,Another junk-movie,1,4 February 2017,"After the good box-office performance of ""Ted"", this sequel was already predictable. It is especially recommended to those who liked the first film and especially advised against all people whose good sense and good taste prevented them from properly enjoying it. The film brings nothing new, just continuing the story of the obscene and rude teddy bear that shone in the initial film. Unfortunately, the manners and behavior of the creature have in no way improved, continuing to be the perfect mirror of a generation of teenagers with no prospects of life, no education, no manners and obsessed with everything that has to do with sex, alcohol or induce hallucinogenic states. The film is supposed to be a comedy but, viewed from this perspective, it takes on tragic and deeply unhappy contours. But I'm not surprised. I was not expecting Seth MacFarlane, a man who likes to make movies and serials with offensive and provocative humor, had suddenly turned into an Amish or something like that. But I remain in doubt whether the art of cinema needed another junk-film for its vast collection. In any case, the film has an advantage (the only one): as a social critic, it allows us all to think whether we want to be equal or better than that bear, and allows me (and others like me) to write texts like this.",Ted 2
47,leonblackwood,There are some funny moments but the first film is better! 5/10,5,13 December 2015,"Review: This movie didn't have the same shock value like the first one but there are a few funny moments. If you watched the first movie, this movie just carries on from where Ted and John were but John (Mark Wahlberg) has now divorced from his wife and he's finding it hard to jump back on the saddle. Ted is happily married to Tammi-Lynn (Jessica Barth), who he met in the first movie whilst working in a supermarket. After living with Tammi for a year, Ted has a massive argument with Tammi but he still loves her and he's willing to do anything to bring back the spark. After asking a fellow worker for some advice, he decides to try for a baby and he asks his best friend John, to be a sperm donor, only to find out that Tammi is unable to have kids because of her history with drugs. They then try to adopt a baby but they are turned down because Ted isn't classed as a human being and it kicks of a spiral of problems against his name. After his marriage has become void and he losing his job, he decides to go to a lawyer for help but as they haven't got any money, the lawyer offers his nieces services for free, as it's her first case. Because of Samantha's (Amanda Seyfried), lack of experience in the courtroom, they lose the case so she asks hot shot lawyer, Patrick Meighan (Morgan Freeman) for his services. He agrees to hear there case so they travel to New York to get his advice and, hopefully, get him on board. After much persuasion and a run in with the evil Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) from the first movie, Patrick eventually comes on board and he manages to get the case turned, in Teds favour. Its more of a serious movie compared to the first one but you still get the marijuana jokes along with explicit content. I didn't find the black jokes that funny and I did find some of the humour a bit offensive but I did chuckle and some of the scenes, especially when they play fighting and smoking weed. There are some great cameos throughout the film, like Liam Neeson, Jay Leno, Tom Brady and the voice of Patrick Stewart but It felt like it was missing something. I wasn't left with that WOW feeling, which I got from the first film but it visually looked spot on. It was good to see Ted ""Clubber Lang"" and John teamed up again but if they come out with a 3rd movie, they really need to introduce some interesting characters. Watchable!Round-Up: Seth MacFarlane, 42, wrote and directed this movie, along with supplying the voice of Ted so he really did give this project his all. Some of the jokes did go a bit too far but Seth is known for his warped sense of humour, which you see in Family Guy, American Dad and his other hit movie, A Million Ways to Die in the West. Ted made a whopping $550million at the box office but this movie only made $215million, which is still a great achievement because of the budget but it obviously didn't have the shock value like the first one did. Anyway, Mark Wahlberg, 44, has some promising movies coming out soon, which include Six Billion Dollar man, we're he will be playing Steve Austin and Daddy's Home with Will Ferrell so he's got enough work to keep him busy for some time. As for this movie, he done a good job, in terms of making it feel like there was a real talking teddy bear in the room but I still was expecting more from this sequel.Budget: $68milliom Worldwide Gross: $216millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Mark Wahlberg, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Morgan Freeman, Jessica Barth with the voice of Seth MacFarlane. 5/10",Ted 2
48,TheMovieDiorama,Ted 2 packs more unhumorous stuffing within its formulaic synthetic fur.,4,20 October 2019,"MacFarlane is a talented comedian, I'm sure of it. His profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary 'Family Guy' TV show. Even 'Ted' was tolerable to a certain degree, and that's saying something. Yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. It's cutaway structure for unrelated gags. Relentless wave of pointless cameos. Ted becoming Peter Griffin. Close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you'll soon realise it's just 'Family Guy', just less funny. Ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.A particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. It was so *interesting* that Morgan Freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his God-like soothing voice. And despite Seyfried actually picking up the script's remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it's utterly forgettable. So much so, that once Wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), I experienced a moment of déjà vu (ironically, so did Ted). Surprisingly, I had seen the first half before. Yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that's how unmemorable this comedy truly is.It exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged Donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. Sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to Warburton's comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). Besides that, there's nothing here. Same old MacFarlane profanity. Worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. ""I love you""?

That's setting the bar very high. With this successful sequel, this comes pretty bloody close. Funnily enough, I haven't seen any reviews for this one, outside of the IMDb one. Wahlberg, again a single, but wanted guy, does what he does best in the first, which is hanging out with his favorite teddy bear, where the lovable crass Ted, hasn't changed, again with killer comic dialogue, in the hands of the reliable Seth Mcfarlane, who knows comedy. Too, what's impressive here with this sequel, there more a story, interesting, and a sub plot too, with that lovable bear, encountering some hairy moments, again being snatched by that psycho Donny (Ribisi), and I cheered when Wahlberg smacked him out, a grand moment at Comic Con. Ted wants to marry Tami Lynn, which for some reason, might eradicate the late night squabbles they've been having, bringing them closer together. He also wants to give her a child, there lies the impasse, which that's only the start of their problems, where Ted is soon not seen fit to be considered part of the human race. John and Ted enlist legal help, from a sexy lawyer (Seyfield) adding a fresh romantic spark to the film, where Wahlberg and her getting it on was of course, inevitable/predictable. Near the end too, I saw straight through that gag with the dead lying Wahlberger. One thing that kind of irritated me, or I didn't like, was with Liam Neeson as a nut job customer in Ted's store, my only grievance with this film. The fine Morgan Freeman, his presence was greatly appreciated, especially in the resolution that's wrapped up quick, in the wake of the sub plot ending with that psycho Donny. I'll be honest, this film came off better than I thought it would, falling shortly behind it's predecessor in the laugh department. In some ways I love this better than the original. So Ted is a high 7, which I'll have to take to an 8. Mcfarlane has thankfully done us proud again, thankfully for this successful sequel, I almost wished I saw at the cinema. You go get em' Ted.

The whole layout reminds me more of Seth's other animated series, American Dad, which had a lot of episodes that had a strong message, layered under fart jokes.It's a no brainier for those of us who love Family Guy(I recognized one of the sight gags from the animated series coming to live-action in the movie), and for those of us who are pop culture junkies (My biggest laughs are when they go to comic con), and then there is a huge chunk of the sequel (a really big one) with the concept of equality,to grasp a new demographic and prove to the world that Macfarlene is not a complete jerk.It's a good message about humanity but it does make Ted 2 less funny than Ted, but it's still worth seeing.",Ted 2

And finally there are films that you could happily have go on for days on end. This is a rare case of the latter, especially in the form of a sequel. Is it better than the original? That's a hard question to answer because both are absolutely hilarious throughout and to separate two films based purely on how much you laughed is a tough thing to do. That's the beauty of anything with Seth MacFarlane's name on it, his sole objective is just to make you have a good time. It just so happens he's good enough at filmmaking to actually make a pretty decent film at the same time.The two hour runtime just flies by. There's only perhaps two dull scenes and both are forgivable as they're purely setting up crucial plot points. Aside from that every scene is a riot. The cameos are plentiful (the cast on paper is actually quite stunning when you consider some of the names they managed to get - a sure sign that people simply want to work with MacFarlane) and all are given brilliant material to work with. Liam Neeson's was probably the best of the bunch for me, followed closely by Tom Brady's. Having no Mila Kunis doesn't overly hurt the film as Amanda Seyfried does a great job replacing her in the lead female role. Mark Wahlberg is back thankfully and his chemistry with Ted is equally as good as the first. There really isn't any negatives I can think of which is a pretty amazing thing to say. If you enjoyed the first, you'll love this one too.

52,BeneCumb,Another nicely shameless creation by Seth McFarlane,7,21 October 2015,"The US is widely regarded as a Western democratic country, but due to various pressure/lobby groups, some statements-attitudes-approaches have become ""widely inappropriate"", i.e. a smaller amount of people considers sth. insulting and tries to influence the rest to ban it from use, often successfully. Such stuff includes ethnic/racial minorities, sexuality, obscene words, physical looks, etc., but the result is often diametrically opposite - those dissatisfied with this lopsided freedom of speech are eager to show it in a blunt manner. The other thing is the excessive use / abuse of the legal system, which is costly, and were the actual biggest winners are the lawyers-judges making fame and/or profit.That is why, both Ted 1 and Ted 2 have enjoyed commercial success, in spite of rude scoffing at the topics above. Being a bit familiar with them, I found myself giggling several times, plus I have always wondered how McFarlane succeeds to attract distinctive and good actors to his not-so-seamless works, in the movie in question, e.g. Amanda Siegfried and Morgan Freeman, and many celebrities making cameo appearances. Unlike in Ted, Giovanni Ribisi's character was less elaborated, less interesting, and spent limited time on screen.True, movies like Ted are not for everyone, but they could make you ponder on and over hypocrisy and that concealing ideas, feelings and words would not make the real events and attitudes non-existent.

53,DarkVulcan29,Upstages the first one a little.,9,28 June 2015,"The first one was funny, but the sequel is a little better cause it has adventure and misadventure to put the Ted character and his friends into. Why I liked Ted 2 better than Hot Tub Time Machine 2, well the Hot Tub sequel could not make any of the gags work, they threw anything out there and it really shows, and nobody was interesting and likable. But in Ted 2 was the total opposite, you really like the characters despite the stupid things they do, leave it to Seth Macfarlane, who can make you be charmed by foul humor and gross out gags.Ted(voiced by Seth Macfarlane) wants to have a baby with his wife, but then he is questioned by the law, he is human or property? Mark Wahlberg and Seth Macfarlane where funny, and have a great comic chemistry. So does Amanda Seyfried has there lawyer, I mean you see that they where having the best time making this. At times it feels like you are watching a Family Guy episode at times cause of all the homages to other classics. All the other supporting cast do well also. This film is like Dumb and Dumber To, not great films, but funny and entertaining films. If you are not into to this, then you avoid this then.",Ted 2

It is virtually impossible not to like the character Ted - A teddy bear that wants to be treated like a human. Simple ideas make for great stories as this movie proves. Mark Wahlberg is the straight man and shows that he is one of the great comic actors. What is more remarkable is that the story is actually a court room drama, but involving characters that are so ridiculously lovable as to transform the story into a spoof, which works as comedy. Everything Ted says is funny and on point. There is an edge to the humor, which makes it even funnier. Just because Ted is a toy doesn't mean he lacks feelings. Ted is whatever we want him to be.",Ted 2

Most of the original actors return, except Mila Kunis, and it is explained why she is not in the picture. The movie opens with Seth/Ted and Jessica getting married. It's not long before they start having marital problems-just like everybody else in the whole wide world does-and they decide to have a baby because, as everyone knows, that always solves the problem. But Seth, being a teddy bear, well he has no ......genitalia. Their only options are to adopt or use a sperm donor and that's when things get complicated. Seth has to go to court to prove he is a person or his status would be that he is considered just ordinary property. His old thunder buddy for life, Mark, helps by getting Amanda, an inexperienced lawyer, to fight for Seth and Jessica. Giovanni shows up hoping that Seth loses in court so that he can use Seth in his own personal schemes. There is a scene involving the NY Comic Con that should bring a tingle to any nerds out there-me included. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Liam Neesom, Jay Leno and Tom Brady, just to mention a few. FYI: there is a scene after the end credits that includes one of the three cameos that I just mentioned. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. If you liked the first one, then you should enjoy this one.

But I could not ""bear"" the rest of the movie with its ludicrous plot of Ted's struggle to be claimed as a person. What!!! The raunchy Ted bear is now married to his cerebrally-challenged but ""easy on the eyes"" supermarket colleague Tammi-Lynn. Ted is still best buddies with Mark Wahlberg's John; no not Mark Wahlberg's bathroom, but the John character he plays who is Ted's best pal and thunder buddy. John is now divorced and in a depressed state. When Ted finds out he is not being designated as a person, he gets John to help his cause for ""I'm a person"" justice alongside novice stoner female lawyer Samantha (which by the way, was portrayed atrociously by Amanda Seyfried). Writer-Director Seth MacFarlane, who also voices Ted, did include a few classic Ted hilarious raunchy scenes. But MacFarlane went way off the the far lane, when he tried to drive ""Ted 2"" into a ""plight for justice"" lesson- learning movie. It simply did not work, and I hate to bear this one on you also: but the bear Ted has overextended his welcome into my cinematic world; the novelty has worn off. Call me wicked, but ""Ted 2"" is the most disappointing (but not worst) movie I have seen so far in 2015. It just was not beary good! ** Needs Improvement",Ted 2

What we have is a swell buddy comedy/road movie with amazing banter, impeccable comic timing and an uncompromising approach to its humor (but never douchey about it), not a lot of attention is paid to the real problem (Ted's horrific marriage) but it's a comedy so that's fine.We also get what is at times a riveting and poignant drama on the nature of personhood.",Ted 2
58,alindsay-al,An average comedy that doesn't hit the levels of the first film,5,18 July 2015,"After seeing the first ted film I was hugely excited for this film while also being a bit nervous because sequels of comedies are never usually as good and this one follows that tradition. The premise of this film sees Ted and John attempting to get Ted's civil rights so he and Tammy Lynn can have a baby. Now Seth McFarlane plays the voice of Ted and just like the first film he is great in this film as the voice of this foul mouthed teddy bear. Some of the things he says is hilarious and he even makes you care about this bear because he is so lovable. Mark wahlberg returns as John and once again he and Ted's chemistry is off the charts and is probably the best part of the film. Also wahlberg shows off his comedic chops in this film and it really does work. Amanda seyfried joins the cast in this film and she was also really good in this film and made me laugh. She also fits in really well in this film with John and Ted. However, I didn't feel the character of Tammy Lynn was that good and I just didn't feel like her character was funny in this film which didn't help. Also for some weird reason Giovanni ribisi is back in his role from the first film and it felt completely forced and completely unnecessary. Now what I liked about the first film is that even though it was a comedy it had a heart felt story to it that makes you care about the characters. This film is all over the place with its narrative structure and I felt like the story was really forgotten about and nobody cared about it. It could have been interesting but it didn't have the substance that it should have done. There was allot of funny dialogue in the film that will really make you laugh but there is also some dialogue that falls flat and you will just be sat there bored waiting for the next good joke that comes around. There is some really funny scenarios in this film with some good cameos but once again it just feels like it is a bunch of comedy skits and nothing to go with the cameos. Overall this is an average comedy that you won't really care to see again.",Ted 2

It doesn't offer anything in the surprise department-it uses lots of drug use and foul language, the same as in the original-but it does offer a different plot and new characters. Whether you liked the original or not will determine whether you like this one. I think this movie was funny with lots of laugh-out-loud scenes, with my favorites being the courtroom scenes, the comic-con part, and the scene in the law library. Amanda Seyfried's new character was terrific. If you have time to kill and enjoyed the first movie, you might like this movie.** 1/2 out of ****",Ted 2

61,jimbo-53-186511,"Has some rough edges, but still manages to bring some big laughs to the table",8,21 July 2015,"Thunder buddies John and Ted are back and now we find Ted married and John divorced. However, 12 months into their marriage Ted and his wife Tami-Lynn are at each other's throats. In order to try to save his relationship with Tami-Lynn, Ted suggests that they try for a baby. Of course, this isn't a straight-forward process and the couple try many questionable methods to conceive. All of this isn't helped by the fact that Ted is told that he can't adopt a child because legally he is classed as 'property' rather than a person. Ted decides to fight this in court whilst at the same time trying to get John 'back on the horse' by getting him to hook up with their inexperienced lawyer Samantha.I absolutely loved the first Ted film and knew that it would be a monumental task for this sequel to live up to my expectations. Whilst it doesn't quite hit the greatness of the first film, it does come close and the good news is that it's still very funny.It may just be me, but in this sequel it felt like there was much less of MacFarlane's quirkiness; the first film was chocked full of it, but here it seems to have been toned down a bit. I'm wondering if MacFarlane was perhaps trying to make the film more accessible in order to appeal to a wider audience. I do like Seth MacFarlane and think he's an imaginative guy, but I've got to admit when watching Family Guy I find myself shaking my head or raising my eyebrows as often as I laugh - sometimes his humour is a bit too weird and out there to make some episodes of Family Guy to be anything particularly special.Much like the first film this film is pretty crude, but unlike a lot of recent comedies MacFarlane doesn't depend on crude humour in order to get laughs. The scene with Liam Neeson is a good example of a funny gag that was clean as well. The Law & Order mick take again shows imagination and creativity. Yeah MacFarlane goes for the obvious sometimes, but there are plenty of jokes that work without resorting to vulgarity.As much as I loved this sequel, there were some minor problems; for a start at close to 2 hours it's far too long and it does drag on occasions. As a pot-smoking lawyer, Samantha is a difficult character to care much about and is nowhere near as endearing as Lori was in the first film - the chemistry between Wahlberg and Seyfried was also notably weaker. According to the trivia section, Kunis declined to appear in the sequel because she was pregnant at the time. It's a bit of a shame because I liked her character in the first film and I think this sequel would have been stronger with her presence (on a personal note I also think that she's easier on the eye than Seyfried, but that's just my opinion).Despite the minor issues, this is definitely worth checking out and I only started to think about the minor problems after I left the cinema (I was too busy laughing to care when I was watching the film). If you liked the first film then I guarantee that you'll enjoy this sequel.",Ted 2
62,sauravjoshi85,Ted 2 will also entertain you!!,7,9 November 2021,"Ed 2 is a 2015 American comedy film directed and written by Seth MacFarlane and is a sequel to the 2012 film Ted. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Barth, John Slattery and Morgan Freeman with Seth MacFarlane giving the voice of Ted.In my opinion the critics are too harsh on this film while giving their reviews, as per the critics it seems that the movie is crap but if you'll watch the film you'll find the film quite funny and entertaining.The acting in the film is good and Mark Wahlberg had again done a tremendous work, the bromance between him and Seth MacFarlane giving the voice of Ted is clearly visible. The addition of Amanda Seyfried is like icing on the cake. Giovanni Ribisi and Jessica Barth were equally effective, John Slattery and Morgan Freeman could've given little more screen time.The screenplay of the film is good and will keep you engaged, the film will keep your funny bones tickling with regular dose of laughter. The climax of the film was little disappointed and could've little better with spending little more time in courtroom drama.

63,aharmas,Ted's a Better Person Than Many Real People,7,28 June 2015,"When I saw they were coming up with a sequel for ""Ted"", I was, well, not exactly looking forward to more of the raunchiness and overblown use of expletives. Here, they keep things colorful but manage to infuse some deeper thoughts and emotions to give it a stronger heart, and the results are successful.Opening with Ted's wedding and the absurdity behind such a relationship, MacFarlane throws in a magnificent reminder of what cinema can be, with a musical number that explodes with creativity and is a great tribute to some of cinema's golden days. Berkeley is back in full color, and it's a lot of fun. From that moment on, we know ""Ted 2"" si going beyond constant sexual references, and this time we will be dealing with the problems with being rejected, being an outsider, feeling disrespected, and most importantly, treated like an object.There are references to contemporary issues all the times, and the fun thing in the movie is that challenges the audience to use both their brains and their hearts, without forgetting whose dialogue is used to convey these ideas. Ted and company are not delicate, and they love booze, drugs, and trashy comebacks. It's that this time, they're not the spotlight. It's not a cute transformation, just a softer incarnation of what the characters have been. Yes, there is stupidity, but it's not overwhelming like it was in the original. Instead it is used in layers, and within references to other classic films, characters, and important political issues. Yes, there are offensive words, but there is a stronger heart here.We have attorneys of all types, and we see how each kind is well, not perfect, and that makes the movie fun, and even a reference to Freeman's voice reminds us how wonderful an asset to cinema for the last 30 years. We can also see some stabs at pop culture, throughout their visit to the comic convention which reminds us of how fickle a civilization is, and how we take so much for granted.Ted might be stuffed animal that came to life through love, and though he learned some subversive and impolite manners along the way, he has a strong bond to those he loves and respects. He's more of a human than some of the characters in the audience, and this time his message is mirroring contemporary situations, and some people might not be comfortable with the idea. It's funny how love, even with Ted's perspective, can conquer it all and still wink at us while it happens.It's not a perfect movie, but a sure improvement over the original. I'm still amazed at how real his expressions are. I have seen Oscar winning actors who can't even come close to showing emotions the way this bear did.",Ted 2
64,aidanratesmovies,Not bad,7,25 May 2020,"At times pretty fun, amusing, and silly- Ted 2 is not as good as its predecessor, but it is able to hold itself together just enough to make for a slightly better than average comedy sequel. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane return in the lead roles of this buddy comedy, and their chemistry again is fantastic. The plot, from what you can follow of it, is all over the place, and it has a hard time figuring what it wants to do throughout the course of its runtime. However, that isn't to say the film isn't funny. It may not be a laugh riot, like the first film, but it has plenty of jokes to keep you satisfied, and just enough to keep you engaged and entertained throughout its nearly 2 hour long run. There are plenty of gags, some of which don't always land, or simply feel random or don't make a lot of sense. The acting is not bad, with some delightful cameos throughout and everyone truly giving it their all despite its juvenile nature. In the end, Ted 2 is by no means a perfect comedy, nor is it a great sequel. What Ted 2 is however, is a fun time that isn't ashamed of what it is, and is just entertaining and humorous enough to provide for a decent watch.
My Rating: 7.5/10",Ted 2
65,jadepietro,Too Much Too Bear,5,1 July 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4) This film is not recommended.In brief: Ted has its share of laughs, but only if you like off-color and offensive humor.GRADE: C+Ted, that cute but crude potty-mouthed teddy bear is back and so is writer /director Seth MacFarlane, offering more heaping helpings of sophomoric jokes and political incorrect humor. Again Mr. MacFarlane seems more interested in offending the masses and mocking any minority groups with an onslaught of racial and homophobic references than setting up a coherent story with genuine laughs, but that is is trademark formula which seems to work for him (excluding his last film, A Million Ways to Die in the West which died a million ways with his fan base). I'd say he walks a fine line, but that's quite a broad stroke he is traveling in Ted 2.It is now three years since our last meeting. Ted has married a dim-witted bimbo and his human buddy has not had much luck in the dating game. But both have enough time to drink beer and smoke pot to occupy their days, much as before. Only now, a problem arises with Ted's marriage being legal. So it's off to court we go as they engage a young pretty attorney who takes their case.The film starts off very promising with its opening credits, a wonderful send-up to the old Busby Berkeley musicals, but the rest of the film never hits this stride. After that, it's non- stop sex and drug jokes that purport the smutty and bawdy locker-room mentality MacFarlane has build his career on. This sequel is more of the same as before, with no risk, only risqué. Subtlety is not in his reach, nor is stinging satire. He hides behind shock humor rather than allow his jokes to flow with the narrative.More often than not, this film has a nice directorial touch and some good comic timing. But more not than often do his skills as a screenwriter hit their intended marks. Much of the humor is overdone and lacks any finesse, as he aims to ridicule easy targets: Comic Con losers, Improv performers, bong and penis jokes are plentiful. Cameos by Tom Brady Sam J. Jones, and Liam Neeson fall flat. One can see that MacFarlane is going for deeper themes this time around with civil rights, marriage equality, and discrimination as the underlying issue. But he is still unable to delve into any measurable depth as he continuously sacrifices his meandering plot for a nasty zinger or gross-out gags. The CGI of Ted and the voice-over work by MacFarlane again are the film's saving grace. The duality of cute vs. vulgar works for the most part. As for its cast, most perform adequately, some stronger than others, with many loyal friends and performers again availing their services to his films. Mark Wahlberg handles most of the duties and he manages to use his personable assets reasonably well to come away unblemished, as does Jessica Barth as Ted's trashy wife. Amanda Siegfried gives one of her better performances and is developing some comic chops. Morgan Freeman, John Slattery, Patrick Warburton, Michael Dorn, and Giovanni Ribisi are wasted. For me, some of the gags worked, others did not. It was hit-and-miss all the way. Depending on one's own comfort level of off-color material, Ted 2 could be highly distasteful or very funny. MacFarlane follows the same lewd formula in this sequel. It's his comfort zone to make others feel uncomfortable. His target audience knows his brand of politically incorrect humor and...humor, as we all know, is in the gut of the beholder.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Ted 2
66,Seraphion,Still as funny as the first,7,8 July 2015,"A few years after the first movie, Ted marries Tami-Lynn and John and Lori had already divorced. One year later Ted's little family is falling apart. A colleague suggests Ted to have a baby. John accompanies Ted to ask Sam Jones to be his sperm donor, but he refuses. Next, John and Ted sneak into Tom Brady's house and try to give him a hand job but they fail that too. John asks Ted why Ted didn't ask him first. Ted says that he didn't want to further upset John knowing John hasn't gotten back into 'the game' after Lori. So the next day Ted and John visit the fertility clinic where John donors his sperm, and they make a mess of the clinic's rejected sample inventory. But then the true hardship comes as Ted's appeal to adopt a baby is denied due to the state doesn't recognize him as a person, only a property. This brings further bad news as Ted also loses his job and gets his marriage annulled. Ted and John then sues the state for civil rights complain but due to having no money they only get a pro bono junior lawyer Samantha Jackson. First they're reluctant to see Sam but they feel like they're the same as soon as Sam smokes pot to ease her migraine. They do the homework of researching and building their case, in which time Ted notices that John and Sam gets closer to each other. However, they lose the case and the state deems Ted as a property. Meanwhile, the villain from the first movie, Donny plots with Hasbro executive Jessup to kidnap Ted (again) since he's now just a property. Sam asks help from a well known civil rights lawyer Meighan, so they go to New York to meet him. On the way, their car crashes since Sam lets Ted drive. John and Sam gets even closer and kisses for the first time while they wait for the next day. In New York, Meighan states he can't help them. The angry Ted leaves John and Sam and heads to NY Comic Con. But there Donny tries to kidnap Tted again. Johan and Sam manages to save him. But Donny rigs an exhibition property to fall on Ted. John pushes Ted away and gets injured. The incident is recorded on the building's CCTV and spread on TV. Meighan sees how Ted is saddened by John's injury and decides to take the case for them. They win the case and Ted remarries Tami-Lynn and adopts a baby boy.The story gives a new take on comedy. It's fresher to see comedies, particularly ones as raunchy as this franchise, to take on the more serious subjects of civil rights movements, and still keeps it funny. It's a very nice timing that the movie gets released at the same time as the US Sureme Court ruled for legalization of gay marriages in 50 states. Yet even with the movie piggybacking the movement's spirit with the #lelgalizeted twitter campaign, it didn't seem to really connect.Still I think the move nice retained the predecessor's sense of humor in its original level and taste of raunchy and corny jokes and references. The movie gets nicely balanced between dialog jokes and the more practical comedies, whereas the first movie seemed more practical in jokes. I see the one liners get even funnier in this movie. I laughed hard when Ted makes a reference to a Kardashian while John has his accident at the fertility clinic.I also enjoy how the movie inserts so many cameos, references and even recreate scenes from other movie and TV shows. These indeed add at least some giggles to your laugh, provided you know the original source. The name play on Sam is also quite a thing since the movie makes Sam as blind to entertainment history or iconic characters. The appearance of Worf is really funny because it's being played by the original actor himself. The acting in overall is still at the same level as the first movie. It's nothing special, but it can cover for the need of comedy. Mark Wahlberg nicely reprises his role and manages to stay quite the same with first Ted's John. Seth McFarlane's voice acting also didn't decrease, as he can really crack laughs with Ted's raunchy one liner and references. Amanda Seyfried turned out to be not a good replacement for Mila Kunis as she can't really grasp the character and give it enough live.Yet Ted 2 (2015) is still a satisfactory entertainment for me. It scores a 7 out of 10 from me and a recommendation goes out to you who can handle raunchy comedies or just eager to know about how the story continues.",Ted 2
67,Sandcooler,"Hilarious, but a bit overlong",8,2 September 2015,"The first half of this movie is essentially a stripped version of the original, we know the characters well now so we get straight to the gags. The first hour is pretty much a perfect hour of comedy, but unfortunately the movie has a lot of padding from then on. Donny was a funny character in the first one, but did they really have to bring him back just to eat up some of the running time? Seth MacFarlane is kinda limited as a storyteller, but the first one was perfectly streamlined and had a great ending. It seemed like he was growing as a writer there, but both this one and ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" bounce all over the place again so maybe he fluked out. Just take the bizarre way the third act is set up, for example. Ted spends the entire movie trying to convince John to ask out the attorney, and when he does...he's angry and runs away? Why? Because Donny needs to kidnap him. So when it comes to the story this movie gets kinda boring near the end, but some of the jokes are just brilliant. My absolute favorite scene is the one where they yell out sad suggestions during improv night: it's the perfect example of a random cut-away gag done right, and MacFarlane is still the king in that field.",Ted 2

69,brando647,A Handful of Funny Moments but Retreads Old Ground,6,18 July 2016,"I am an unabashed Seth MacFarlane fan. I loved the first TED in 2012 and I even, for whatever reason, enjoyed A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST way more than most people would think acceptable. But that doesn't stop me from recognizing that maybe, just maybe, TED 2 never needed to happen. And when I discovered it was happening, I'd hoped MacFarlane and his writing team would come up with a fun new reason to rejoin the adventures of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his plus pal Ted (voiced by MacFarlane). It certainly appears so at first but then it isn't long before it devolves into rehashed elements from the first film. We rejoin them as Ted and his girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) are tying the knot in a ceremony overseen, of course, by Flash Gordon himself, Sam Jones. We flash forward a year and see that married life isn't going so well for the lovebirds, and Ted is given the idea that having a child will rejuvenate their marriage. Seeing as how he's a stuffed bear, the usual means of procreation are out of the question and, after a series of misadventures, he and Tami-Lynn turn to adoption. Here's where Ted's life begins to fall apart; his adoption attempt red flags him with the government whose official stance is that Ted is not a person, but ""property"". TED 2 is the tale of John and Ted teaming with a young, stoned upstart lawyer (Amanda Seyfried) in an attempt to battle the court system and award Ted personhood.TED 2 has some stuff that works. I love that a portion of the film becomes a road movie with John, Ted, and Seyfried's Sam L. Jackson driving from Boston to New York to meet with a famed civil rights lawyer (Morgan Freeman) in hopes that he'll take Ted's case. That whole segment of the film works for me and I kind of wished the whole movie had been one big crazy road movie. I also enjoyed the BREAKFAST CLUB homage/montage in the library when the trio are preparing to first argue Ted's case. I loved the usual string of pop culture gags and raunchy humor we expect from MacFarlane, and I loved the chemistry between Wahlberg, Seyfriend, and Ted. Seyfried was a treat in MILLION WAYS TO DIE but MacFarlane upgrades her to co- star this time around and, as with Theron in the former movie it's great how game she is to sink to the levels of humor these movies call for. Since MacFarlane is a self- professed geek, we also get some great cameos that'll make Star Trek fans grin, especially Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf from ""Next Generation""/""Deep Space Nine"" for those not in the know) as Patrick Warburton's lover. The problem is when MacFarlane's geekiness gets a little out of hand in the final act of the film, set entirely in New York ComiCon where it's as if someone broke the valve off his pop culture love and it just starts spewing uncontrollably all over the place. It becomes a literal battle royale of beloved pop culture icons.That over-indulgence I could've forgiven if the rest of the movie hadn't tripped over itself and face-planted. I have two grievances with TED 2. The first is the rehashing of plot lines from the first TED. It's annoying enough that we have to go through an entire new romantic subplot for John and Sam (John has married and divorced Mila Kunis' Lori in the time since the last film, rendering the plot of that movie pointless) but TED 2 also brings back Donnie, as played by Giovanni Ribisi. I really liked Ribisi in the first movie. The man knows how to play awkward and creepy, and Donnie's obsessive quest to acquire Ted for his own son was both. In TED 2, Donnie now works for Hasbro and conspires with the CEO to steal Ted (who is now property, so it wouldn't be kidnapping) and cut him open to see what makes him sentient. Did we need to revisit Donnie's unhealthy obsession with stealing Ted? Couldn't we have found a new antagonist for the movie? Maybe the toy company itself with the CEO leading the charge? Again, it would've been nice to change things up a bit. My other big mark against TED 2 is how seriously it takes the human rights issue at the center of it all. We get not one, but two overly serious lawyer speeches in front of juries explaining how Ted is more ""human"" than toy. Guys, this is a movie where a stuffed bear tries to steal Tom Brady's semen. Keep it light. Overall, TED 2 feels aimless like it just doesn't know where it wants to focus its energy, and the constant borrowing from the first film's playbook makes me think TED 2 could've spent a little more time in the planning stages to bring us a fun new (emphasis on ""new"") Thunder Buddy adventure instead of what we got.",Ted 2

All the amusing bits are cutaways and side gags of the type that MacFarlane is famous for, but they have nothing to do with the main plot, so a naturally lighter subject should have been chosen for the story, to make the whole thing flow better and feel funnier.Macfarlane seems to think he can take heavy subjects like big screaming fight scenes, (a ""Raging Bull"" homage) and they will automatically be made funny because a teddy-bear is there... Not true; you have to be cleverer than that. He's a funny guy, but he surrounds his amusing ideas with belaboured bits that go on too long, and then has to use a pop-culture joke or a movie reference to reverse himself out of the cul-de-sac his singlemindedness has created... The longer a misfire goes on, the more you're likely to notice it; keep the attempts at humour snappier so that the duds are likely to slide off quicker.Just because you've created a character and it's funny doesn't mean that everything you do with them is golden. He should be thankful for the few genuine laugh-out-loud moments he's got in the tank, because they get him out of jail and earn this movie a higher rating than it would otherwise deserve.The laughs are there, but they're not as diverse as the first movie. It tries to be oddly serious and 'weighty', for some reason, and it's not a great choice. Recommended only for those who would watch Ted in anything!",Ted 2
73,Screen_Blitz,Funnier and better than what I was expecting,9,29 June 2015,"Seth MacFarlene, along with Mark Wahlberg returns as the trash-talking teddy bear who brought the laughs and fun in this sequel to 2012's hit comedy Ted. Mila Kunis, however, was unable to return as Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from the first film. This time around, Ted has married Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), his feisty girlfriend from the first film. One year's passes by, they begin dealing with marital problems until Ted hatches an idea for them to have a baby, hoping it would solve marriage problems. His plans only ends harder than he expected. To make matter worse, the government rules that Ted is not a human citizen, which results in him losing his jobs, losing his bank account, and having his marriage with Tami-Lynn annulled. In attempt to get his life back together, Ted and his buddy John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) get help from a lawyer named Sam (Amanda Seyfried) for a court case to prove he should be considered human.After seeing the first film, I was more than excited for a sequel. As most sequels to comedies go, I didn't expect this to be as good as the first one. However, it ended being almost as good as the first film. It contained plenty of hilarious dialogue that had me laughing almost constantly. Yes, the dialogue is pretty raunchy and vulgar like it was in the first film, or perhaps even more so. Nonetheless, I was satisfied with it. The gags were pretty funny, especially during the scene when Ted and John were visiting the hospital to get sperm for Ted's baby. There are a few gross-out scenes that may not be funny to everyone, the hospital scene being a perfect example. Ted was funny as ever and often stole the show with his off-the-wall humor. Mark Wahlberg was also quite funny as well, perhaps even more so than in the first movie. In this one, his character is even more dumb and often lead Ted and himself into the most hysterical and unpleasant shenanigans. I also pleased by the casting of Amanda Seyfried as the lawyer who helps John and Ted during their mission. I think her character was very clever and well written, even if she wasn't as funny as Ted and John. The storyline was okay, even though I felt that the film could had a better plot. This film may have gotten mixed reviews, but I think it deserves higher. If you loved the first film, there is a very good chance you will enjoy this one. Even if it may not level with the first one, it is still worth seeing.",Ted 2
74,Troy_Campbell,"Just awful. Truly, utterly, unforgivably awful.",1,24 June 2015,"Here I was thinking Entourage was going to be the biggest comedic disappointment of the month, and then along comes the abomination that is Ted 2 to prove me wrong. Onto his third feature film as writer-director and Seth McFarlane appears to have run out of gas already; this is somehow an even bigger dud than his sophomoric misfire A Million Ways to Die in the West. There's not a single, solitary laugh-out-loud joke to be had in the entire (dragged out) runtime, and all of the titter-worthy gags are in the trailer. A Million Ways may not have been as humorous as expected, but at least it had energy and ambition, two elements sorely missing from a stale sequel that nobody seems interested in doing. Even Mark Whalberg – an actor who is nothing if not committed – merely goes through the motions and offers up a completely inoffensive performance, which, in this genre, is just plain offensive. Throw in a midday-movie-ish score, McFarlane's trademark fetish for misplaced musical numbers, and way, way too many scenes of po-faced sincerity, and you have a genuine turkey of a film. Oh, and the straw that broke the camel's back? An utterly awful Liam Neeson cameo that makes him look like an amateur. Ugh, it's that bad.",Ted 2
75,maurice_yacowar,The bear's humanity validates civil rights and pop culture,7,15 July 2015,"The obvious theme of Ted 2 is the expansion of civil rights in America. The film opens and closes with come-to-life teddy bear Ted marrying full-size sexpot Tami-Lyn. Between those ceremonies Ted is stripped of his legal status as a human. He is defined as property, therefore disqualified for a job, credit cards, bank accounts and marriage. He can even be abducted and cut open without legal recourse. The plot aligns Ted's fight for recognition with America's stuttering battles over civil rights, from reluctantly accepting the humanity of blacks and women to accepting gay marriages. The film's structural theme is the celebration of pop culture. As Ted wins acknowledgment of personhood, the film exercises the recognition of popular culture as a valid form of artistic expression, an art as capable of serious statement (e.g., civil rights, the triumph of personhood over objectification) as is traditional high art. The spectacular pre-title Busby Berkeley musical number and the climactic chase through a comic convention clearly establish pop culture as the film's arena of interest. Ted's neophyte lawyer Samantha is characterized as woefully ignorant of pop culture, whereas Ted and friend John at least have the verbiage to play at being lawyers. Ted and villain Donny are drawn out of hiding by their reflex responses to pop songs. Cameo appearances by Liam Neeson, Tom Brady and the Saturday Night Live crew confirm the focus on pop culture. And after all, pop culture is as American as the — ever unending — campaign for civil rights.Ted's relationship with John replays the bromance genre in American film. The two love each other but are careful to exclude any homosexual implications. Both have women in their lives, John the spectre of his ex-wife and Ted his Tami-Lyn. They're repelled by Samantha's phallic glass hash-pipe — a schlong bong? — but Ted weakens. He adopts Rocky opponents as his surname and his adopted child's name. John's fake death is guy-play, an insensitivity to emotion, that Samantha properly finds horrid.But despite that macho pretence— and Ted's and John's swaggering sexual profanity — there's a curious innocence in Ted's marriage. He and Tami-Lyn love each other despite his not having a penis. That only becomes an issue when they try to save their breaking marriage by having a child. Deploying John's semen, they are thwarted by Tami-Lyn's sterility. Love without sex — that innocence evocative of Andy Hardy and the decades of romantic abstinence — puts this raunchy vulgar romp into the tradition of antique Hollywood. Significantly Ted is pantless through most of the film because — like Donald Duck and his Disney-mates — he's asexual. When Ted starts his legal fight for personhood he wears a green tie. That's the bud of his human clothing. At his triumphant trial, when he's declared human, he's wearing a full suit. He has adopted the ritual wardrobe of the human, however in his case unnecessary.Their pro-bono lawyer Samantha, in her first case, comes on as too hip for the law. At their first meeting she's swearing and smoking her water-pipe — an augur of her fit with these irregular clients. Though she loses the trial, she is validated by what she is, a caring, feeling person. The good woman is a good lawyer even though she lost, as the unbeaten lawyer opponent is ridiculed for being too slick to care. Similarly, the civil rights champion (Morgan Freeman) who initially refuses Ted's case because Ted hasn't done anything for anyone, changes his mind when he sees the love between Ted and John. That's the crux of the civil rights controversy in America: people deserve full rights not because of what they have done or how they are classified but because they are human beings. This film should be required viewing for Judges Scalia and Thomas. Not that it would help them. They're impervious to even popular culture.",Ted 2
76,aciessi,Thunder Strikes,7,25 June 2015,"I came to laugh, and laugh I did. ""Ted 2"" is a ridiculously stupid movie, the thing is, when Seth MacFarlane directs it, I like it more than the average dumb guy movie. I was gut-busting more times than I expected to. Was it as inspired and heartfelt as the first? Of course not. It would've benefited if it was, but there is only so much you could squeeze out of a pot-smoking bear, without getting more of the same.. lots of fuzz. The story is predictable, yes. Yet it stays away from being too serious, which I applaud MacFarlane for doing this time around. He divulged in some really hacky melodrama in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", and I prayed that it didn't happen here. Luckily, he doubles down on the laughs. However, he also doubles down on the offensiveness. This is a mean movie, folks. Prepare to scoff and scowl at how low it goes. Some of it does work, partially due to how Ted's racism and homophobia is humorously typical of a loud Bostonian. I'm not sure how anyone will feel about Ferguson and Charlie Hebdo, and Robin Williams death jokes. The 22.3 year rule has never applied to Seth MacFarlane. For him, it's about a 4 month rule. Putting aside all of the flaws, I can happily say that ""Ted 2"" delivers as a comedy. It's a vast improvement over Seth's last film, and it's making me crave third film. But if they have to put the bear to bed, so be it.",Ted 2

Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane are a great comedic duo",7,19 June 2021,"Ted 2 is directed and co-written by Seth MacFarlane, it's very much a MacFarlane movie and I like how humorous it is but the story isn't as good as its predecessor. I actually watched this film at the cinema back in 2015 and it was a blast, I have watched it multiple of times since then and I enjoy it. Some jokes fall flat which the first film didn't but for a sequel it's pretty good. I do like the overall story of Ted becoming a person but I don't think the editing or pacing is quite good, nor is the writing if we are comparing the two. My opinion is quite mixed but one thing I know is that I find this film hilarious, it has re-watch value.The film has many actors returning as their respective characters. I miss Mila Kunis' character though, but Amanda Seyfried, John Slattery and Morgan Freeman is welcome additions to the cast. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane is clearly the highlights of the movie, pure entertainment and comedic gold when they're on screen, its their execution of the witty and funny dialogue but also the chemistry they share. Ted 2 follows the newlywed couple as they want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law.If Seth MacFarlane ever makes a third Ted movie, I hope he makes it bigger and more original. Ted 2 feels much the same as its predecessor for good and bad, but the familiar territory that the film takes is appreciated in terms of entertainment value.",Ted 2
79,RforFilm,"If you enjoyed the first movie, then you'll probably like Ted 2. Just don't expect to laugh as much",6,30 June 2015,"I have previously reported before that writing comedy is difficult as it relies on two principles; that all comedy is based on misery and that it needs to remain unpredictable. It's hard for comics, especially for long running comics on Comedy Central or even the Monty Python trope to remain unpredictable because they tend to stick with the methods that work best for a laugh and if you watch something like The Three Stooges or Monty Python long enough, you'll definitely notice a pattern. When the joke starts to remain repetitive, the best thing to do is to fold the act and try something else, more unexpected that an audience would have not seen coming. Seth MacFarlane is one comic whose currently is the state of finding a new voice while working with an old one. A Million Ways to Die in The West didn't respond well with audiences, tanking at the box office while on television, fans of Family Guy and American Dad have noted that the neither show was as funny as it used to be. I too have found that Family Guy has become tired and repetitive in stories. Since he did well with Ted back in 2012, it only made sense to have another go around with the foul-mouthed teddy bear in Ted 2. The movie opens with the wedding of Ted (played by Seth MacFarlane) and his girlfriend from the first movie Tami-Lynn. Things are looking good for this teddy bear, but his best friend John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg) is down in the dumps after being divorced from Lori six months ago. Ted tries to get John to meet up with more woman, but the guy is too depressed to date again. Months go by and the relationship between Ted and Tami-Lynn has become sour, up to the point where they end up arguing in their apartment. Ted gets the idea that having a baby would be a good way to save the marriage. After two sperm donations are botched, they find out that Tami cannot conceive children. They resort to adopting, but they are denied as the United States government does not recognized Ted as human. This ends up canceling out the marriage and causes Ted to loose many of his civil rights. To prove he is human, he and John decide to take the case to court where a young lawyer Samantha L. Jackson (played by Amanda Seyfried) represents them.The first thing that Ted 2 does right is that it doesn't retread the same story from before. They couldn't have anyway as the first movie had a very sitcomish feel, but was fine the way it was. What is retreaded are the fearless jokes from MacFarlane that are more hit and miss this time. I do recall laughing at the first half hour more then the rest of the movie. Because MacFarlane wants to get in as many laughs as possible, he relies way too heavily on jokes that are cutaway gags or simply references to movies from the eighties. What I will say is that the actors delivering the comedy are sure trying their hardest. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane still have great chemistry, as if they've been friends for a long time. Amanda Seyfried does well as the young lawyer and new love interest for John. But this is where my biggest problem lies. The story of Ted revolved around John and Lori getting together and working around Ted. The fact that Ted 2 decided to leave the first love interest out is kind of disheartening. I'll give this six Ted bears out of ten. I see this sequel as a mixed bag, but those going in will either like or hate MacFarlane's sense of humor. I'd say watch Ted and Family Guy before committing to seeing this sequel. Just don't expect to laugh as hard. But I did Laugh.",Ted 2

The movie is not be in good taste, but it is funny.Perhaps it steps over the line with a Nine Eleven joke but a Teddy Bear can get away with it.

82,Anurag-Shetty,An improvement on its predecessor.,9,13 July 2015,"Ted 2 continues with the story of the foul mouthed teddy bear Ted(Seth MacFarlane), who was wished to life by John(Mark Wahlberg) in Ted(2012). Ted marries the love of his life, Tami-Lynn(Jessica Barth). After a year of marriage, the spark between the couple has been totally lost & they're constantly arguing. So, they decide to have a baby to hopefully, fix their broken marriage. However, Ted is told he can't have a baby because he is technically, property. First, Ted will have to prove he is a person in a court of law. John & Ted enlist the services of up & coming lawyer, Samantha(Amanda Seyfried). Ted 2 is an outrageously hilarious film! It's more shocking than its predecessor. People who are easily offended, will hate this movie. However, that is Seth MacFarlane's style of comedy. Absolutely unapologetic. When I first heard MacFarlane was making Ted 2, I thought it was a completely unnecessary sequel. However, I'm really surprised to tell you that I liked this film better than Ted(2012). The most refreshing aspect of this follow-up to the 2012 smash hit is that, hardly any of the jokes & gags from the first movie are repeated. The American court where Ted fights for his civil rights, is a hysterical setting for the outlandish Ted & John. This sequel turns out to be necessary because, the story concentrates more on Ted while the first film concentrated more on John's story. Mark Wahlberg is brilliant as John. Seth MacFarlane is the highlight of the film as Ted. Amanda Seyfried is a welcome addition to the cast as Samantha. The fact that Samantha is more similar to John & Ted than Lori(played by Mila Kunis in Ted) makes her character way more interesting & funny. Jessica Barth is great as Tami-Lynn. Giovanni Ribisi is amazing as Donny. Morgan Freeman is spectacular as Patrick Meighan. Sam J. Jones is good as Sam Jones. Patrick Warburton is awesome as Guy. Michael Dorn, John Slattery, John Carroll Lynch & Ron Canada are impressive as Rick, Shep Wild, Tom Jessup & Judge respectively. Liam Neeson is outstanding in his cameo as the Customer.

83,bob-the-movie-man,More laughs with additional stuffing,7,9 July 2015,"""Ted"" divided most audiences: some loved it; some hated it; with few holding a middle ground. ""Ted 2"" is much of the same style of humour, so if easily offended best skip this one.The film starts with Ted marrying his sweetheart and supermarket co-worker Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), whilst John (Mark Wahlberg)'s relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis from the first film, who could clearly not be tempted back) has already hit the rocks.Ignoring the fact that consummating the marriage is clearly going to be impossible without an ""appendage"", Ted's attempts to have children draws attention to his legal status as 'Property' rather than a 'Person'. What follows is a legal battle to prove Ted's humanity, with a sexy young lawyer (Amanda Seyfried) acting as both legal aid for Ted and a rekindling of love interest for John.As often in Seth Macfarlane films, there is a plethora of cameos, some of them very funny. For example, the human rights lawyer needs to be a ""Harrison Ford type of lawyer"", and you'll never guess who plays the part? (and no, this isn't a spoiler – it wasn't!). My favourite cameo was by Michael Dorn as the strong and silent half of a gay couple: if you know what role Dorn is famous for and link that to where the film's finale occurs then you have a dodgy costume winner of a belly laugh. (By the way, it's also worth staying through the interminable end credits for a final humorous cameo).Mark Wahlberg again proves what a good comic actor he is after his roles in the original ""Ted"" and the underrated ""The Other Guys"". And the excellent Giovanni Ribisi (""Friends"") returns in the role of the evil and jealous Donny from the first film, now nearer to the heart of darkness as a Hasbro janitor.Seth Macfarlane's Ted is also a comic creation of genius that can get away with highly offensive lines by just looking cute. However, in my view, a line does get crossed with the script a few times in terms of good taste, particularly in terms of numerous black jokes that seem to come at you apace in the middle of the film. (Offence is in the eye of the beholder and I'm not black, so can't legitimately comment on how close to the knuckle these were).The multi-talented Macfarlane again directs, and this is a vast improvement on last year's turgid ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". At 115 minutes the film doesn't outstay its welcome, but could still in my opinion do with a nip and a tuck in places. As examples, the big Hollywood-style dance number in the opening titles (surely the first since ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""?) is a bit pointless and makes Ted look more false than in the whole of the rest of the film, and a mid-film song by Seyfried seems to be trying to rehash a classic campfire scene from ""The Three Amigos"" but rather misses the mark.In summary, if you liked ""Ted"" you will probably like ""Ted 2"". But it has an 18/R rating for a reason, with extensive bad language, sexual references and drug taking (""They move in herds"" – LOL) that may offend.(If you enjoyed this review please see the visual version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address for future reviews, Thanks.)",Ted 2

85,bryank-04844,'Ted 2' Packs the Laughs but lacks the magic.,5,21 July 2015,"Who would have thought that Seth MacFarlane's (creator of 'Family Guy') first feature film about a pot-smoking foul-mouthed teddy bear would have made over $550 million at the box office back in 2012? I certainly didn't expect it, but it's the sole reason why we have the sequel to 'Ted', simply titled 'Ted 2'. I'll be honest with you. Macfarlane did a fantastic job with the first film, making an 'R' rated comedy with heart and enough laughs that are still memorable today. He even threw in some great cameos and nods to pop culture references, much like 'Family Guy' does.Even though the first film dragged a tiny bit in a few places and got off the rails, it still was a very enjoyable experience. A little later, MacFarlane made his comedy western 'A Million Ways to Die in the West', which had a few laughs, but tried to hard to deliver every joke imaginable. It was forced and not by using the force by any means. That is more or less the case with 'Ted 2', although I did laugh almost from start to finish with the hilarious raunchy dialogue that is still topical.The main problem with 'Ted 2' is again, trying to put to many references and gags into a short amount of time. There is no real benefit to it at all other than saying, ""Hey look, there's that reference to that movie or actor."" While it might make for a quick second smirk or laugh, it is almost immediately forgotten to get to the next pop culture reference. And when you teeter on doing a few dozen of these in the span of ten minutes, it becomes tiresome.Also, 'Ted 2' runs right at about two hours, which is a little bit longer than the first film, complete with the some slow moments that don't forward the film any, but instead rely on over-the-top laughs to get a cheap rise from the audience. I don't mind that so much, as long as there's a point, but with this movie, there isn't.The story is good enough in the sequel, which takes place a couple of years down the line where Ted has married Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and John (Mark Wahlberg) is divorced from Lori (Mila Kunis) from the first film. Trouble is brewing in the new marriage where Ted thinks having a kid with Tami-Lynn is the solution to their marital problems. However, he is not anatomically correct and cannot bear a child. So they try a few routes, which prove unsuccessful, including breaking into Tom Brady's house and trying to steal his manhood.They also try adoption, which catches the ears and eyes of the government in stating that Ted is in fact not a human or a person, but rather ""property"" and is denied citizenship and forced to lose his job as a grocery store clerk and more importantly, his marriage is not recognized by the state anymore. This problem sets the tone for the rest of the film as Ted and John embark on a legal battle to win his citizenship. They enlist the help of newbie lawyer Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), who is taking on her first case with Ted, which he is reluctant to have her represent him. But, when she breaks out a bong in her office and tokes up, Ted and John know she's the right one.Through 80's montages and a trip to New York to seek the help of the country's best civil rights's lawyer (Morgan Freeman), 'Ted 2' is packed with laughs, which ultimately ends up at New York Comic Con, where all things pop culture collide in an epic battle, including Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) takes place. First and foremost, Mark Wahlberg is fantastic here in this movie. He has perfect comedic timing and sells every line and action with an invisible bear. He needs to do more comedy like this, because he excels at it.McFarlane again has one of the best voices in America right now and is so believable and funny as the voice of Ted, that I can't help by want to listen more. Seyfried holds her own with the guys here as well and is always a delight to see on screen. The 80's-90's movie references were quite impressive, so be on the lookout for those Spielberg and John Hughes moments throughout.Oh yeah, and I'd like to mention that Michael Dorn and Patrick Warburton are in 'Ted 2' as well and they bring a few surprises to the table. 'Ted 2' is one of those typical comedy sequels that thinks that the bigger the movie is, the better it is. This is an aspect of sequels that is all too common, and it doesn't always pay off. Still, 'Ted 2' is rather enjoyable with tons of laughs. Maybe enough for two movies, but it lacks the magic the first film had.",Ted 2

88,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,9 March 2021,"Appearing as something unexpected in the cinema, the feature Ted, written, produced and directed by Seth MacFarlane, had a protagonist who was only sympathetic in appearance, since the behavior of the stuffed animal and its owner are politically incorrect in the extreme, something that has remained in its continuation. Ted is an animal that came to life in a tasteless way, as it was the result of a desire of its owner. What no one expected was the behavior he would have in his supposedly adult phase. As in the first film, he swears, smokes marijuana, talks openly about sex and pornography, as well as a series of unconventional behaviors. Speaking of unconventional, the film already begins with Ted's marriage to his (human) girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), and that with all the traditional arrangements like wedding dress, and the like. Well, after getting married, the problems start, not the traditional ones, because the teddy bear starts to have its benefits and legal rights hunted, because it starts to be considered a property, not an ordinary citizen. Thinking about it, he and his owner John (Mark Wahlberg) begin a saga in search of a lawyer who can turn the situation around, which leads them to find the also madman Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried); the latter one that guides the desperate pair in search of the perfect defender for Ted's ""humanization"". As you can imagine, there is a festival of jokes involving a little of everything: sex, drugs, nerdy culture, cinema, famous people and so on, always trying to seek a good laugh in situations that do not depend on making sense. It is certainly something that Deadpool has raised exponentially, although in this Ted 2 there is a greater purpose than revenge, which sounds even more human and sentimental than expected. The cast headed by Wahlberg still has the help of great film and TV personalities, such as Giovanni Ribisi who returns as the villain Donny; Morgan Freeman as the respected lawyer Patrick Meighan; John Carroll Lynch as a Hasbro manager; Lian Neeson as a paranoid customer but who appears to dose a little more acid and clueless MacFarlane humor. The presence of the teddy bear on the scene is not at all sweet, although the appearance still wins the attention of the female audience, as it is an alpha male who makes a point of proving this, and the neat visual effects give an even more impressive tone to the character, the that makes the interactions fantastic. Using the Comic Con fair as the stage for the third act, undoubtedly a genius move (and nerd) by the director and screenwriter, TED 2 bets on the formula that enshrined the original at the box office and still serves as a showcase for fans to identify characters at all times ( cosplayers) at the fair in question, certainly a fact that further expands the result of the fun being undeniable in this great comedy.Film reviewed on March 8 for March 9, 2021.",Ted 2
89,MrDHWong,"If you didn't like the first film, give this one a miss",7,23 December 2015,"Ted 2 is the sequel to the 2012 comedy Ted starring Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg. The first film was an enjoyable story about friendship and that was mainly the reason I liked it and its sequel does pretty much the same thing, only with a more serious tone. Aside from that, it still manages its fair share of crude but funny jokes.Sometime after the events of the first film, Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) has married his girlfriend Tami-Lynn. Unfortunately, married life begins to take its toll on the couple, as the two are constantly arguing with one another day and night. In an attempt to fix their marriage, Ted suggests that the two adopt a child, which Tami-Lynn happily agrees to. However, in order for them to legally adopt, Ted must prove in a court of law that he is human and able to father a child. Ted, Tami-Lynn and his best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) hire rookie lawyer Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried.) to help them fight their case, which becomes highly publicised by the media as a result.Despite its more dramatic tone, this film still manages some pretty funny jokes. I enjoyed the parodies of civil rights court cases involving a stuffed teddy bear. My favourite character in the film was Sam Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), the laid back but determined lawyer who wants to help Ted win his case. The film's pacing was slower than the first film, most likely to cater to its dramatic moments. However, I feel the film's crude humour, while not as frequent in the original, would be very off putting to casual film- goers. Also, at almost 2 hours in length (115 minutes), the film begins to noticeably drag near the end. If you didn't like the first film, give this one a miss.I rate it 7/10, the same score as its predecessor.",Ted 2

And it is Funny it Smokes Weed. Also Liam Neeson shows up at his Work to buy a box of Trix. And stuffs it in his Jacket after he buys it Lol. Giovanni Ribisi is in both Film's after the Teddy Bear. Then as a Lawyer he gets one of the Best Actors of all times Morgan Freeman. In both Film's he does not get low Actors he gets the Best for his Film's. Oh and the Teddy Bear that is getting Married his Wife is a 10 out of 10. She is so Hot also in that on part they are having a fight in the Kitchen. The Wife pretty much Kicks the Teddy Bears Ass. Throws everything at him. What makes that even Funnier he is wearing a short sleeve t-shirt. You know the One they call the Wife beating T-shirt. What makes that even Funnier that is the Only part he is wearing that T-shirt. Great Films.,Ted 2
91,billygoat1071,Spared For The Laughs,6,26 July 2015,"Ted 2 now focuses on the titular anthropomorphic teddy bear in, having his own life of marriage and plans ahead of getting a non-biological child. This leads to a strangely interesting conflict about gaining civil rights to a teddy bear. And it's stranger that at some point the movie does take it somewhat seriously, and eventually goes back to its crass hijinks. It's nice, but nothing much compelling in the end, because what obviously overshadows it is definitely the outrageous laughs. But even the degree of laughs suffers the same problem; it's full of energy at first then it awkwardly mutes its lighter tone for its climax. Fans of the first may get the same pleasure that they seek, but there is really nothing special to it, either.The first half really has the strongest amount of funny moments and also brought some intrigue to the story's center. But the movie apparently cannot decide what exact approach it is generally taking. The outrageous comedy is still everywhere, but whenever it stops by focusing on its themes, it really takes it seriously, like it actually believes that it is saying something important. But the movie hardly earns anything to deserve that attention. It's just shifting from its outrageous nature to a sudden gravity back and forth. Even for a comedy that is actually just fooling around, it stills displays a mind of uncertainty. There is also some bits of attempting to replicate Broadway; with dance numbers and a song. Can't tell if that's one of the movie's way of tripping or the director just wants to show off that he can do a musical. Either way, it rather feels nothing more than a random filler. The movie is also a little too long, the movie hitting the same major problem of the first film by setting up a climax that it's supposed to drive tension. It never felt right for the film, even worse, it's more like a rehash, reintroducing the same villain except it takes place in a different location. It's rather awkward and tedious than effective.The sentiment doesn't felt convincing enough for the movie's true colors, but then it's all about the humor. And if the humor works, then there is a worthy roar of laughter to get from this film. Predictably raunchy, pot fueled and consists pop culture references; that will certainly be enjoyed if you understand the language of a Seth MacFarlane comedy. It's fun if it really tries to be fun. The performances from its lead actors are still a joy to watch. MacFarlane still manages to put energy to the talking teddy bear and Mark Wahlberg is still committed to fool around as Ted's man child best friend.Ted 2 doesn't bring the same surprise of the first one, but if you're in for more outrageous laughs from this profane talking teddy bear, then it won't be a problem, as long as you're not expecting too much. The film does try to bring on an important theme, but it's not as effective or as strong as it wanted to be; it does make some interesting arguments, just doesn't have any powerful or at least earned conclusion to it; but hell, who would exactly take that seriously, anyway? Well, no more than the movie itself. It should have been shorter, the storyline should have been tighter, and the third act should have tried harder than repeating its predecessor. Again, it can be really funny, it just suffers handling its ideas better.",Ted 2
92,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Comedy Courtroom Drama Road Movie Mess,2,26 June 2015,"For what's considered a silly stoner buddy comedy, TED was pretty philosophical, taking on everything from pop culture to relationships to religion. Through the safety net filter of a foul-mouthed, pot smoking Teddy Bear, Seth McFarland could channel everything he loathed without restraint and, providing the voice of the titular doll turned human-like sidekick of Mark Wahlberg's sweet-natured Boston slacker John, the sky was the limit.Like any comedy sequel, the main agenda here is to go so overboard, fans will forget the past. Right off the bat is a dance number opening credit sequence, as if Seth's Oscar gig inspired an extravaganza that might lead to something maybe not better, but definitely bigger this time around... Nothing doing.With a semi-serious plot about Ted going to court to prove he's human enough to have a baby with his wife; a new love interest for the divorced John in cool chick lawyer Amanda Seyfried; a pointless road trip and a handful of lazy cameos seeming like guests at a stranger's funeral, TED 2 doesn't try for anything, really, that would push the envelop any further in this bland vehicle, too contained to be extemporaneous, too restrained to be raucous, too reserved to be controversial, and using the same lame villain, can't even die with dignity.",Ted 2

The first one was new and exciting, this one is showing everyday life of a teddy bear and his wife, then gets twisted to a court battle over something that is clearly just stupid in many ways, but thats the story line here :)This film has it's moments, but it just hasn't got the news sensation about it, yes there are clever lines, good jokes and funny scenes, but for me that just wasn't enough this time around. It had to be something new again, most of it worked but we all knew where it was headed, we all knew how it would end and we all knew that it would be childish jokes, no point and just shenanigans all the way.The childish parts are the better ones, Mark Wahlberg being kind of like a kid and having people follow his childish way of living and loving a teddy bear whilst in your mid 30th that is amusing, but it just isn't enough.",Ted 2
95,MattBrady099,Squeal bait,4,30 June 2015,"Thunder buddies for life.The story is about Ted and Tami-Lynn are married and the next step is having a baby but Ted can't be legally regarded as a parent unless he can prove his is ""human"" in a court of law.Now looking back on the first Ted movie I got say I changed my mind on it a bit and what I mean is that it wasn't as great as I remembered it to be, but I still think it's decent enough to give it a pass as a comedy and a film. But then I heard news about a squeal in the works and then I heard that Amanda Seyfried, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson was in the film and that alone give me a little interest in the movie just by that movie news. I wasn't jumping for excitement for this movie as I the movie didn't look anything special, just squeal bait. Now after seeing Ted 2 I'm not very impressed of what I watched, actually this movie is pretty bloated for it's own good.What I liked in the first Ted movie is the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and the character Ted. They back and forward humor really worked if you would believe it, I mean a pot smoking talking teddy bear hanging around with Elliot Moore from The Happening would actually work is just beyond this world. And here they chemistry is still good just like in the first movie.The movie did make me laugh a couple of times as that's mainly Wahlberg and Seth chemistry in the movie and some other stuff that's only a small little nod to a film or TV and it was funny at first until late on where they stretched out the joke to the point were it got really old and really stale very fast. But I do think this movie is way better then Seth MacFarlane last movie A Million Way to Die in the West as that movie didn't even try and was pretty forgettable, I mean it's been a year since that movie came out and I forgotten pretty much all of it.What really surprise me is how messy the movie is and the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, because these three different things going on in this movie like Ted is trying to prove that he's a human because him and he's wife want a baby but Ted needs to prove he's human so he can be legally parent (Yeah I know it doesn't make any sense, just go for it for now) oh and these a road trip in the movie and remember that stalker in the first Ted movie that kidnapped Ted well he's back in this movie. That's the whole movie of Ted 2 for you. Oh one last thing, Ted 2 is kind of the same as the first, I wish I can go into details of that but that would be spoiling it for some people who may have interest of seeing this movie and I'm being nice here and won't be spoiling anything.Before seeing this movie I thought that Amanda Seyfried wasn't going to do anything great, I thought that she was just filling it in for the money, but I got to say that she was pretty good in the movie. She actually did something with the story and didn't feel like a background character. She was Wahlberg worked really well with each other and Ted as well. Same thing with Morgan Freeman.Overall Ted 2 isn't all that great to me. As I said before about a billion of times by now you may disagree and like the movie and completely overall on what I said, again that's fine that's cool, enjoy what you enjoy, but I'm sticking what I put down and it won't change anytime soon.",Ted 2
96,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Ups the ante, lewder and ruder - but is it better?",7,16 July 2015,"Lewder, cruder and ruder - Ted 2 ups the ante in typical sequel fashionAs far as sequels to comedies go, Ted 2 isn't half bad, of course it's no where near as funny as the first Ted film by Seth MacFarlane – but who are we kidding, did you even expect it to be? The love lives of our friendly thunder buddies John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted have not progressed as one might expect. John is now single and very much not ready for a new relationship, as his web browser history suggests, and Ted and his busty babe Tami-Lynn are no longer living in sin, as they are recently hitched. With the honeymoon period over in no time, they decide to fix their marital woes logically, by having a kid to fill the void. But when Ted has to prove he is a person in a court of law, the problems just keep piling on.So what do you get from a sequel of a surprisingly funny film about a foul-mouthed teddy bear by Seth MacFarlane? A story that is stretched a smiiiidge too far in terms of believability. Fewer quality jokes for cheap obvious jokes and infinitely more cusses and drug references. As sequels go, which are typically filled with new faces and recasts that are far less compelling, Ted 2 keeps it to a minimum and the only addition, Amanda Seyfried, practically steals the show by keeping her performance realistic but out of the box from her other roles. What you also get are loads of pop culture references and perverted antics you won't want to admit to yourself were amusing.It's okay, your secret is safe with us. Ted 2 will be funny enough and makes up for it with celebrity cameos. Well admit it, we were happily surprised by the film but it's still hit and miss for us so we probably won't watch it a second time.6.5/10 Please check out our website for all the reviews of the recent releases, comedies and blockbusters.",Ted 2

In Ted 2's case they didn't ruin the first at all with this hilarious comedy sequel. Ted 2 is a very funny film that I found myself in stitches more than half the way through, I think if Mark Wahlberg wasn't back in it as John I probably wouldn't of watched it. Very entertaining movie, Ted has never failed to amuse me. This is a masterpiece of comedy and drama built into one laughable adventure in the funniest way possible.This was a great watch and I'd highly recommend it to all Ted fans and family guy fans this was a great one!",Ted 2
98,rooee,Ted talks,6,10 July 2015,"The original Ted gave us the story of a lonely boy named John who wished his stuffed bear would come alive. Jump forward a couple of decades and the cute kid had become a layabout 30-something, mirrored by his foul-mouthed, horny buddy Ted. Aside from the unusual central pairing, the setup was a typical ""bros versus hoes"" comedy. It had its moments and made half a billion, so here's the sequel, and for me it's the slightly better film.John (Mark Wahlberg) is now divorced from Lori, while Ted (Seth MacFarlane) is just married to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). When the teddy/human couple goes to adopt a kid it draws attention to the fact that he is not human – he's technically property. John, Ted, and newbie lawyer Sam (Amanda Seyfried) set about taking the case to court, asserting that Ted's ability to love is proof of his human status.If this sounds like a sentimental setup that's because it is. What we have here is a strange mix of puerile humour and long monologues about what it means to be human. At the film's heart is a very sombre message which is hard to swallow when borderline race jokes run up against dead serious reminders of America's history of slavery.As with the first movie, your enjoyment of the film will largely depend on your appetite for the Family Guy breed of comedy. I was personally pleased with the sequel's more solid plotting and unusually weighty themes, but still less-than-enamoured with the bullying tone of some of the humour. It's hit and miss: the sperm donation clinic sequence is hilarious; the celebrity cameos, less so. There's a great scene which amusingly alludes to both Jurassic Park and Contact. But then Patrick Warburton returns as Guy and his alpha aggression marks the movie's nadir.For a scat-comedy, MacFarlane goes beyond the call of duty as director. Combined with the brilliantly bouncy orchestral score (think John Williams in chase sequence mode), with sweeping cranes and dollies and plentiful cityscapes MacFarlane evokes the formal aesthetic and adventure spirit of classic 80s family screwball – albeit with dirtier gags. I like how characters meeting Ted for the first time don't show any shock at his form, which shows admirable resistance to the modern comedy nuisance of self-reference.The Hasbro subplot, in which Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) returns as a disempowered toy company employee, doesn't really go anywhere and basically exists as a very long build-up to a final, fantastically cruel gag involving a lethal Starship Enterprise. It's a decent joke, but by then you'll be feeling the overgenerous runtime.Ted 2 is a worthwhile sequel, sporadically funny and at times oddly thought-provoking. Fans of the first won't be disappointed, and latecomers to the party can easily jump aboard. Its combination of vicious humour and cuddly moralising is jarring, however – a pity, because a more inclusive script which wasn't at war with itself might have made for a great modern fable.",Ted 2
99,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,26 June 2015,"Definitely a step backwards from the first one and definitely a step backwards from the Seth MacFarlane standard of comedy (A million ways to die in the west not withstanding). I definitely hoped for much more, yet still I managed to leave with a slight smile on my face.What starts out as a strong comedy with the jokes we love from MacFarlanes' comedy slowly turns into a a pathetic watch, ending on a low note close to a commercial. It really looks like around half of the movie someone just said ""f*ck it"" and left a computer directing. In the second half all we get or a couple of mild laughs and that would be cool had it not been filled with multiple attempts at drama. I was in the cinema asking myself ""why the hell is this going on in a Ted movie!?"" Really there was so much occupied by totally serious monologues or dialogues that not only never paid of in a joke but also had the most generic, and I mean it, dialogue and direction. They were scenes of an unbearable badness. They seemed to have been put together by a program, that's how generic they were, plus the jokes that connected these scenes were cringe-worthy. Another negative unfortunately has to be Giovanni Ribisi. I have always been a supporter of his, but be it the dialogue, the type of jokes he is given or his over emphasized performance, he never got a laugh out of me, unlike the first Ted.For a movie that seems to have so few effort put into it, it's actually surprising how good it turn out. The first half has really strong moments of comedy, some great original and expected jokes that really pay off and promise a better final result. I laughed really hard there and some of the scenes really had extreme situations that were exhilarating to watch as much as they were disgusting. Ted also works again on all levels, you really feel like he is there and it is not something granted when talking CGI characters, yet all the actors make it feel authentic and the CGI is absolutely flawless. Basically thinking back at it I am just fascinated at how much I was enjoying myself until it started not giving a crap and not only it stopped being funny, but also it started being hate-worthy and I it really bugs me. This is not a good comedy overall by many standards, yet it isn't the train-wreck it could have really risked being. There are great jokes, but again I just can't help but be disappointed by what the movie ended up doing.",Ted 2

Problem is, he's not a ""person"" but a ""thing."" Cue a Law and Order style civil rights suit in the Courtroom. Rude, crude, disgusting in places, witty and with so many nods to other films and homages. The Jurassic Park scene is brilliant. MacFarlane gives heart to the wonderful Bear, and the chemistry between the goofy Wahlberg and Ted is lovely. Ribisi returns as the dodgy Tiffany-fetish bad-guy again, and Freeman is suave in his gravitas role but still brings some smiles. The SFX for Ted are flawless - and he's so believable. For an adult version of the children's film - a living Teddy Bear - it's got depth, character and charm, as well as many many headache-inducing laughs. Our cinema clapped on a few occasions. Lots of f-bombs, general bad language, drug use and sexual reference/innuendo. Not for everyone but a feel good, if a smidge formulaic, uplifting romp.",Ted 2

In fact it's not for many with his latest feature length film. Ted was all about the thunder buddies and the ups and downs of their relationship. The second takes a completely different approach. Instead of mocking political subjects, which Ted 2 focuses on, Macfarlane fills up it's long running-time by abusing celebrities, with distasteful dick jokes and awkward racism. This time round the puns invoke little or no reaction. Mila Kunis is sorely missed, replaced by a reputable but unconvincing Amanda Seyfried as a lawyer. John Bennett (Walhberg) and Ted's (Macfarlane) relationship never flourishes past the first film.

Why? Because I see in it the same disgusting humor, nasty words, drugs and gross content. That is not a nice way to make someone laugh. I don't know what's in the director's mind and in the actors who appear in this when they present this to a large audience. Please stop this atrocity and don't make a third part. Enough is enough. I don't know why I bothered watching because I know what to expect. The hole movie is ridiculous from start to finish. The idea is stupid, a person is not 40 cm in height and surely is not a teddy bear. One of the worst comedy of all time and nobody should ever waste the time to see it, only if you have the brain of those who made it. If you are one of the peoples that rejects all the things that are happening here or wants to make this world a tidy place you will close it after five minutes.

104,luke-a-mcgowan,Completely inconsistent and unremarkable. They didn't need another one of these.,4,13 September 2015,"In 2012, Seth Macfarlane took a ""hey wouldn't this be funny"" concept and stretched it into something special - a delightfully funny, quotable and sometimes even sweet story about a teddy bear who came to live. In 2015, he delivered us a sequel that pretty much no one wanted.The most irritating part of some sequels is that they make canon things we don't want, therefore ruining the first film as an experience. Here, John (Mark Wahlberg, who is it just me or is he perpetually flexing in this movie?) is in a slump after inexplicably breaking up with his loving wife Lori (Mila Kunis) off screen. This pretty much makes the first Ted storyline redundant. The scraps that Macfarlane leaves of the first one are then reappropriated in this movie, in the form of the completely unnecessary reappearance of Giovanni Ribisi's Donny, whose subplot ultimately has no effect on the overall story. Ted and John set out to restore Ted's civil liberties when he is no longer recognised as a human. The film doesn't by any measure succeed as an inspirational law film though, which would be fine if there weren't a few scenes where it felt like they were trying to. Perhaps the fact that their lawyer, Sam L. Jackson - a joke included for the one joke in the trailer - is a pothead has something to do with that. Surprisingly, Sam has perhaps the only meaningful moment in the film, with an opening argument so eloquent and even moving that the law student in me was nodding approvingly. Kudos whoever wrote that. But I don't watch Ted 2 for complex legal drama, I watch it to laugh, and the film does that pretty well. The humour is typical Family Guy humour - cutaway scenes to certain events, random celebrity cameos, and pushing the boundaries. A scene where Ted reacts to Neil Diamond was a small one but very funny. Shouting out sad suggestions to an improv team had me rolling around in my seat. A wickedly funny and self-mocking cameo by Liam Neeson was the film's absolute highlight. A lot of the other humour falls flat in a tirade of penis, pot and poop jokes. Wahlberg doesn't look very lively, and his relationship with generic love interest Sam is extremely forced. During their first kiss scene I felt like if I swivelled the camera around, I'd see Macfarlane lounging in the director's chair shouting ""ok, action, now you kiss guys."" John Slattery is tremendously wasted as the supposedly never-lose lawyer. Ron Canada confirms black stereotypes everywhere by playing Generic Black Judge #234954. Morgan Freeman cameos (as a distinguished civil rights lawyer (which would impress me if the great man didn't appear in pretty much anything that paid) , who fixes all the film's problems nicely with a few minutes of speaking in his buttery voice. Okay look, I'd probably give civil liberties to an Xbox if Morgan Freeman asked me to. Point taken.Ted 2 is in a word inconsistent - its got at least one profound moment and three or four big belly laughs, but the rest of it is so unremarkable that I'd have been happier without it.",Ted 2

He makes it very funny referring to the american media and culture in a satirical way. Some of it's characters are so fun it is like comedy genre when it reminds you of the Family Guy and it's funny and quirky perspective way of looking at the comedy.Like the prequel this is so much fun.But it is not for everyone.Overall - 3.5/5.",Ted 2

It delivers a bunch of laughs built primarily on crude, in-your-face humor and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Seth MacFarlane proves once again that he has his finger firmly on the pulse of his target demographic because the theater was in stitches throughout most of the film. That being said, a comedy doesn't have to sacrifice cinema in order to deliver laughs. I think the first movie was a prime example of that, as it was a genuinely good movie in addition to being hilarious. Instead, MacFarlane turns this movie into a live-action version of Family Guy. The plot is choppy and it essentially feels like a series of random skits, pieced together to form the semblance of some over-arcing plot.

In ""Ted 2"" (R, 1:55), the writer-director-star uses almost every ""bad word"" in the English language, glorifies illicit drug use, makes about the crudest jokes imaginable, offends groups of different races, ethnic persuasions and sexual orientations and indirectly makes fun of several tragic news stories from the past decade and a half. And most of it is absolutely hilarious. You might say that he had me and the rest of the non-stuffed animals in the theater in stitches.""Ted 2"" picks up a few years after the story in McFarlane's 2012 surprise hit ""Ted"" left off. Man-child John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is six months divorced from Lori Collins, his girlfriend in the first movie, as John's living teddy bear and best friend Ted (played again by Seth McFarlane using his voice and motion capture technology) is about to marry Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth), his girlfriend from the last movie. It's not long before Ted and Tami-Lynn are having problems. The financial strain of living off of their incomes as grocery store cashiers, while wanting more, is leading to some nasty arguments. Ted decides that having a baby will bring them closer together and Tami-Lynn is all in.But there's a challenge. Ted, lacking the requisite anatomy to turn such a dream into a reality, needs a sperm donor. When three separate attempts at getting a donor go hilariously and disturbingly wrong, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt. Their application is disapproved because it calls attention to the fact that Ted is not technically a person. He had been living a relatively normal life (for a crude, rude, foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, stuffed bear), but now he's in danger of losing everything he is, does and cares about. It seems the only answer is to sue the government for his civil rights. Inexperienced, pop-culturally illiterate lawyer Samantha L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) takes the case.John is right at Ted's side through all the little guy's challenges in this movie (""thunder buddies for life""!) and they're both as incorrigible as in the previous movie, mocking each other's misfortunes, playing pranks on each other, occasionally fighting, and often smoking weed, drinking and making comments and behaving in ways that would be considered highly inappropriate in polite society. Fortunately for us, they don't care much about being polite, and fortunately for them, Samantha bonds with them both and gives her all to representing them in court. The story draws parallels to the historic struggle for black civil rights and the current struggle for gay rights, but mainly Ted just wants to be declared a person so he can live his life. It's a tall order from such a short bear. His case is completely unprecedented, plus, plotting and waiting for Ted to lose his case and be regarded as no more than property is his old enemy Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), who is making some plans of his own with one pretty powerful person.Throughout the movie, we're treated to all manner of crass and politically incorrect humor, along with great supporting turns by Patrick Warburton as a gay bully, Morgan Freeman as a famous civil rights lawyer, and ""Flash Gordon"" actor Sam Jones as himself, plus hilarious cameos by, among others, Tom Brady and Liam Neeson. And since this movie comes from the mind of the man who created TV's ""Family Guy"", there are pop culture and historical references galore, including songs, TV shows and movies from several different decades, helped to no small degree by a key scene at a New York City Comic-Con, with most of the participants dressing as their favorite comic book or sci-fi characters. Oh, and when the movie's ""over"", be sure to stay to the very end of the credits. Trust me.""Ted 2"" is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original. The movie has enough plot and enough jokes for two movies. If you're open-minded enough to check your attitudes toward impropriety at the door, you'll likely agree that much more of the humor hits than misses. You'll probably end up liking these characters and laughing at their antics in spite of yourself (and in spite of any fear that both you and the film's creator will be subject to eternal damnation for being party to such humor). I hope that if you see this movie, you'll agree with my assessment, but if not, as Ted might say, ""F--- you! I write these reviews for free! I don't need this s---! I'm outta here!"" But you'll have to forgive Ted. The bear has no filter. I will simply and politely end this review by giving ""Ted 2"" an ""A-"". Take it or leave it, people! (Sorry.)",Ted 2
109,robsta23,Not Disappointing Like I Expected,8,6 July 2015,"I was hoping they wouldn't explain Mila Kunis' absence in the film as a divorce and was kind of angry when they did since John's relationship with Lori was the WHOLE POINT of the first film. As the movie moved along, however, it didn't seem as important, especially when John is explaining the failing relationship to the new female lead played by Amanda Seyfried.I have to say I think this film made me laugh much harder than the first one did. And the amazing part about this is that while it was still funnier with random comedic bits (and sometimes cutaways like in Family Guy) it also had a much better (and slightly more complex) plot than the first. After Ted and Tammy-Lynn submit an application to adopt a baby, Ted's life is ruined once his case is reviewed and he is not considered a person in the eyes of the government. His marriage is invalid, he loses his job, and he cannot adopt a baby as he wants to, which also makes for a much more serious plot than the first movie.I don't want to give away any of the comedic bits since this would spoil the jokes, but I really do think this movie has funnier moments than the first (and sometimes more disgusting moments). Also, the good thing is that the humor is spread throughout the film pretty evenly so you get good laughs every now and then instead of just at one or two portions of Ted 2. Some jokes do fall flat, especially when there is a reference to SNL (which doesn't have a very good cast nowadays anyway). If you want to know more about the comedic tone of the movie, just look at my review for ""Ted,"" I'm not going to state the tone of the movie again if I don't have to.",Ted 2
110,ctowyi,The Thunder Buddies Are Back!,6,2 July 2015,"Seth MacFarlane's Ted (2012) was ingeniously hilarious to the max. How do you send a barrage of racial and religious slurs, and an avalanche of sexual jokes into the faces of the audience and yet draw no foul? You make a teddy bear do it. Ted also knows how to tinge the sacrilege with a sweet bro-mance that takes the sting off it. Did it still have enough jizz for a sequel?Ted 2's trailer lays out the new shenanigans Ted and his man-child buddy are up to. Newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law. The idea is irrelevant, ridiculous and preposterous, but it is the perfect territory for Seth MacFarlane's brand of unsophisticated potty humour delivered with wacky power.We were quite entertained with the movie and laughed out loud numerous times. That's the mark of a good comedy but IMHO Ted 2 falls wide off the mark of being a great comedy. It felt like the same old jokes repackaged. Some of the ideas are just too frivolously conceived. For example to mend a marriage one would need to have a baby. That didn't work for me. Finally, this being a MacFarlane vehicle it feels terribly self-indulgent and self-obsessed. It felt like he wrote so many jokes and he couldn't bear with deleting any of them to make the movie tighter. That made the middle act feel too long with too many redundant scenes and the jokes wore thin after a while. Thankfully it never loses its heart. At the heart of it the franchise has always been a sweet examination of friendship, loyalty and love, and the outlandish plot wisely steers it back to its natural state with aplomb.All in all it is not a bad way to spend an evening. We laughed because the thunder buddies are our pals too. My wife did feel the franchise is at its end and she hopes Ted 3 doesn't happen. I don't know about that. It may be quite funny to see Johnny and Ted grow old.",Ted 2
111,loco_73,A Million Ways To Donate Sperm....The Sequel,6,29 June 2015,"""Ted 2"" is the completely unnecessary and unwanted sequel to ""Ted"", a much funnier and better movie than its sequel.Don't get me wrong, there are still plenty of laughs to be had in this movie. It is not a complete letdown, I just think that it really didn't need to be made as the previous one pretty much ended up on the right note and there was no need to re-visit the character.McFarlane's writing and gags still work, skills honed during the long-running life-cycle of the still funny and biting satire that continues to be ""Family Guy"". McFarlane's love for show tunes and old school Hollywood musical extravaganzas also continues to be present which is a mixed blessing.So while the movie is not a complete throwaway, it is first of all too long, like an unnecessarily expanded ""Family Guy"" episode. The movie is all over the place, trying to be a parody, a gag-gross-out comedy and at the same time, a serious courtroom drama.""Ted 2"" lingers and meanders, especially during it's ""serious"" portions which could have easily been cut out, since the movie's plot is pretty much redundant and is only there to service all the jokes and gags.And just a word of caution to McFarlane, in his quest to be edgy and show that ""yes, I went there"" type of humour, some of it falls flat at times and ends up feeling and sounding just mean-spirited, and even offensive, which is not a problem of comedy, but it is a problem of comedic timing and lazy writing.Mila Kunis, McFarlane's long-time collaborator and I would guess muse, is nowhere to be seen in this one, and while Amanda Seyfried is a decent actress most of the time, she is just doesn't add much in this instance. Her chemistry with Mark Whalberg, whose part has been reduced to that of second fiddle to Ted, flatlines at the outset and is nowhere near what Whalberg had with Kunis. There is a more plausible connection between Ted and Tammy-Lynn, his former girlfriend now wife, played by a most welcome returning Jessica Barth.In so far as the cameos in this movie, some are funny and some wholly unnecessary. At times it feels like McFarlane is showing off...""Hey! Look! I know all these people and I can get them into my movie!""...Seth McFarlane is undoubtedly a talented individual, actually multi-talented and somewhat of a Renaissance man. And ""Ted"" was a worthwhile debut for him as a ""comedic"" director. But in his almost manic and often frenzied mad-dash to convey his creativity to the rest of us, McFarlane can end up all-over-the-place as evidenced in ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" and now ""Ted 2"".I think Set McFarlane would benefit from a creative circle around him, people who can talk him down and when needed rein him in and teach him that sometimes more is not always better.",Ted 2
112,datorsiers2,Dumb fun for some cheap laughs,5,31 October 2017,"Very similarly to part 1 ''Ted 2'' is nothing more than a bunch of sex jokes and pop culture references mixed together. Not that it is horrible, it's just quite boring to be frank with certain exceptions of the occasional funny one-liners.A very easy to watch film, that definitely shouldn't be taken seriously as knowing the premise itself is already more than enough to determine where the story is heading. Have to give ''Ted 2'' some credit for having a couple of clever pop culture references and its ability to make fun of the concept of the film itself. I loved how they directly made fun of Amanda Seyfried even though she was part of the main cast, a good addition to the already reference and gag based blend.Overall, just an easy to watch, light comedy about a ridiculous talking teddy bear just like the first one, it isn't any different and if you have seen the first part, don't expect anything new here.",Ted 2

The idea that any state would take a toy bear to court and say he is property even though he can think and speak is just stupid.Seth MacFarlane is again the writer which means lots of crude unfunny jokes, tons of non sequitur references to obscure things, offensive jokes about minorities, and generally dullness. Oh and nonstop pot references that do nothing to further the story.Why any woman would want to marry a teddy bear is beyond me.I laughed about three times through the whole thing.AVOID",Ted 2
115,stephendaxter,"Good crude humour, but not at the same level as its predecessor",7,25 June 2015,"Ted 2 is the sequel to the very successful Ted which happens to be my favourite comedy of all time, so after the trailers, you could say i was looking forward to seeing what this could bring. And it did a pretty good job at including a lot of the crude humour you would expect from this sequel. I thought it had many funny moments that were well spread out over the entire film, a good amount were just funny while there were a few really really funny moments, unfortunately almost all of those really really funny moments were in the trailer so you knew they were coming. As well as the funny jokes there were also quite a few that fell flat, I will put them into two categories to make it easier; the jokes that were obviously there to try and top what was done in the first film, and, the jokes they re-used multiple times throughout the film. And there were like 4-5 jokes they used at multiple moments and it did get exhausting by the end. What it was missing was some more unpredictable jokes that the first film had, it did have a few that completely catch you off guard but a lot are predictable so that was a little letdown. The plot? it was alright i guess, but who cares it's not the focus of the film where you have a swearing teddy bear, so when stuff happens you just go with it. It moved pretty fast but it also slowed down at times, the jokes really determined where the plot was going to go. Oh, and there is a side plot that i won't spoil because you don't know about it from the trailers, but it is so dreadfully boring and brings down the film a lot. It was just boring and felt like it was out of place and thrown in there just to add another 30 minutes to the film, so yeah, the film could have cut that 30 minutes out and it would have been much better. But in the end Ted 2 offers the crude and unpredictable jokes you want, so that aspect you will like if you liked the first film, unfortunately there is not enough of that to make it as good as its predecessor. If you just completely zone out during the side plot you will not miss a thing and will make for a better experience. - 6.7",Ted 2
116,CMTiago,"Seth fans rejoice, Seth haters stay away",8,20 September 2015,"Get ready for a mostly positive review on a hilarious movie. Why? Cause I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane's work and therefore Ted 2 is right up my alley. As for anyone who dislikes the film or MacFarlane, then this isn't for you.So the movie starts with Ted getting married to his beloved Tami_Lynn and after a year of marriage they decide to have children. But with this Ted will have to fight for his person hood, as the State just now decides to classify Ted as property. Although I do think this plot point delivers some intriguing questions, it serves as only a decent backdrop to the humour we came to see and once again MacFarlane delivers. The jokes were very on point for me and it had me bursting with laughter. As for Wahlberg's character John, he supports Ted with this struggle but also gets a new love interest in the lawyer that Ted has hired named Samantha (Seyfried). As a new addition, I think she did fairly well and was a very likable character.Overall, if you were a big fan of the first one like me, then you'll love the new one.

This time Ted must battle for his citizenship against the world, of course through funny, disturbing, and emotional turns along the way.

Stretched out to two hours. Which makes sense, considering the titular bear is voiced by the creator of that show. Oh, and he's the director and co-worker. So, yeah.Every popular song, movie and TV from the 80's and 90's is possibly spoofed or parodied here... Sometimes, even with cameos from the original artistes. But what's funny in small doses in a 22 minute cartoon quickly becomes tiresome when 9 out of every 10 jokes revolve around corrupting nostalgia, and you may find yourself responding with a roll of the eye by the end, instead of laughter.As for the rest, well what can you say? It's a heartrending tale of a man and his bear. One is having relationship problems, the other wants a baby. In that order, believe it or not. They drink together, watch animal porn, smoke a LOT of pot and throw apples at innocent joggers. Ho ho.The film tries to make us feel for their relationship, but I'm sorry... All I saw is a couple of jerky, potty-mouthed man-children who really needed to grow up. And believe me, coming from THIS reviewer, that's saying something.So, which is better... This, or the original Ted? Well, the same way the new episodes of Family Guy are a climb-down from the first few seasons, Ted 2 is inferior to it's predecessor.Only, the decline is not so deep.

If you liked the first Ted, you'll definitely laugh at this film a few times, but the movie has far too many jokes that fail, for long stretches. Many of the jokes that fail are reiterated multiple times, and some of the other jokes are just plain not funny. Another aspect is that so much of Ted 2 is spent either talking about or copying other movies that very little of it is actually original. It goes without saying, the film's not very intelligent, despite it's moments, and that illustrates the most obvious flaw of this film. The film is tonally and narratively erratic, one moment the film's silly, the next it's really dark, and the plot runs like an extended episode of family guy.

While the plot doesn't do anything daring, it is a bit smarter. The plot has underlying themes, some heart, and of course shallow, indecent, and offensive situations. While MacFarlane does not do anything out of his realm here, he does adult humor well, and he has many ""smart"" gags, lines, and scenes here.The court scenes are decent, but my favorite scenes here are the scenes with Tom Brady, the scene at the sperm clinic, and the scenes at Comic- con.

128,keithlovesmovies,Ted 2 Review,7,29 June 2015,"That foul-mouthed, drug abusing teddy bear that we loved from the first  movie is back for more. The film picks up 6 months after the first film  with Ted and his best friend John still friends before Ted is about to  get married and John is feeling down after having been in a divorce.  Once married, it isn't what he imagined. With his relationship in  trouble, his solution is to have a baby. Little did he know that the  government would soon recognize how he's been living his life as a  person. When his personhood comes into question, he now has to fight to  maintain his marriage and for his own civil rights. Ted, John, and new  for this film, a young female lawyer Samantha L. Jackson (obvious joke  alert) must sue the state of Massachusetts in order for Ted to be  recognized as a person while Ted tries to find someone for John.  If you've seen the first film, you won't be surprised by this one.  You'll get all the dirty, homophobic humor that was in the first Ted or  from any episode of Family Guy. This film still seems to have the charm  that the first one had. I also enjoyed the opening musical sequence of  the movie as well. Some may not be a fan of the humor in this film as  it could easily be considered offensive. I don't know what that says  about me but I liked it. I wasn't a fan of Seth MacFarlane's earlier  film ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" but this one has the right  amount of stupid but doesn't take it too far.  Sure there aren't as many jokes in this as the first film so they chose  to take what they had and stretched it over the film's running time at  almost 2 hours (which could have been shorter). The film occasionally  suffers from an identity crisis, it wavers between a social commentary  about one's civil rights and an extended Family Guy episode but doesn't  do enough of either. I did like what I saw but I just wished that there  was more of it. I believe it could definitely have gone without a few  minor plot lines for I believe that they took away from the main story  and added to the unnecessary length. I won't mention the few cameos in  the film other than that there is one noteworthy one that you will  definitely not expect but will definitely remember. Overall, it's not a  bad film but I thought it could have done more. I liked this one just  as much as the first film but not more.",Ted 2

Some over the top, crass humor throughout - again you probably already know whether or not you like Family guy type jokes taken to the next level of vulgarity and below the belt humor. A couple of cool cameos sprinkled in the movie. Performance wise, you also already know whether or not Wahlberg is your cup of tea but I was pleasantly surprised by Amanda Seyfried.

130,kieranbattams,"Raises way more questions about human rights than any Seth Macfarlane production should, and that's not a bad thing...",8,9 July 2015,"In 2012 when Seth Macfarlane's directorial debut was released, I, like many other people enjoyed it a lot. It was a basic film about a man and his senile teddy bear who would just smoke weed, swear a lot and hang out. That premise was enough to get us on board and it worked for a one off feature film. After the box office success it received a sequel was inevitable.. but how could a film with such a premise possibly do anything more to become a franchise? Well not only does Ted 2 ramp up the laughs, it also gives us a surprisingly strong plot and pulls it off well.The basic premise is that Ted has married Tammi-Lynn from the first film, whereas John has divorced Lori. Following some marital problems, Ted decides to save his marriage with a baby, but in order to do this he has to prove that he is a person and not just property in the eyes of the law. Enter Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) and yes as you would expect there are many references to the Hollywood star. I knew Mila Kunis was not coming back for this film and after her performance in the lacklustre 'A million ways to die in the West' i was not expecting Seyfried to be a good replacement, but she fits in with the cast very well. Just like the first film the chemistry between John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (Seth Macfarlane) is what makes the comedy work so well, you really believe you are watching two real life friends hang out, rather than Mark Wahlberg and a CGI teddy bear. The plot wasn't what made the first so enjoyable, it was their bond. Amanda Seyfried fits in with these two so well and as a trio they really mesh well together. She brings a lot of laughs to the table and I actually liked her character more than Mila Kunis'. Whilst the plot is very good and holds up, the third act takes a bit of a plunge and almost copies the last act of the first film completely. Giovanni Risbi reprises his role as Donny and does exactly what he did originally, just for a slightly different reason. The film could have done without this to focus more on the human elements, even though it was hilarious to see Ninja turtle Raphael dance to 'I think we're alone now'. It almost felt like filler to make a longer movie. The small road trip segment to me was great, we got spoofs of both Planes, Trains and Automobiles and a great Jurassic Park spoof in the space of a couple of minutes. In fact the pop culture references from Rocky to Flash Gordon (Sam J Jones returns) were pretty great. I also loved the courtroom scenes, and even Morgan Freeman in an extended cameo provided us with a very good look at what human rights are all about.What i wanted from this film was to laugh, which i did, a lot more than i expected to as well which is a bonus. Look out for a hysterical cameo from Liam Neeson. The 'is Ted a human' storyline felt like a bold and wonderful step forward and brings up way more questions about human rights than any Seth Macfarlane production should.. but not in a bad way at all. It focuses a lot less on the drugs and crude jokes, even though they are very much still there! But the way it was executed was just great. I wish the third act had stuck with it, but by the end if you are a fan of Seth Macfarlane's work such as Family Guy you will come out satisfied after plenty of laughs and a surprising amount of heart. Will we get a Ted 3? Most likely, but if it keeps up what Ted 2 did right then i just might be okay with that.",Ted 2
131,jcjs333,You have to be kidding.,1,11 June 2017,"This could not be worse. Firstly, the 'F' word is used a zillion times in the first 5 minutes. Dirty or forceful vulgarity is so appropriate, magnificent, poignant when used sparingly and with punch at the right moment. Otherwise, i think brainless writers and compliant actors. It's not as disgusting and low life, uneducated trash talk which isn't the least bit humorous of interesting. The whole deal looked like the actors were asleep the entire show. I have no idea how they could stand doing it. I paid online and so wish i hadn't because i couldn't force myself to watch it. Making things worse was i had watched 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' the night before. Taiki Waititi' stuff out of New Zealand is gut bustingly the best i've seen in decades, maybe ever. Percentage-wise, American movies, especially comedy (or even drama)are so much worse than what's coming out of New Zealand and the Scandinavian ('River', 'Lillyhammer'). In this 'Ted 2', dirty language, smut, porn references, repeatedly to 'Bl--k C---'. I forced myself to watch around 15 minutes and had to turn it off. I thought, 'Mark Wahlberg', 'The Fighter' but who is this Mark Wahlberg? On reflection, i realize 'Wahlberg' does mostly stuff that's below par and produces the same. In 'The Fighter' his co-star Christian Bale does 'wow' stuff. There aren't words strong enough to say how bad this flick is. And, watching Taiki Waititi's stuff the night before made 'Ted 2' all the much worse. No, American comedy comes close to what's coming out elsewhere. I don't know if it's the Facebook generation which has made Americans unable to communicate seeping into everything, or what, but yuk. Like 'La La Land' which i thought was bad compared to Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor and Sid Charise. And, Red Buttons, Shecky Green, Red Skelton, Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Ma and Pa Kettle, Abbot and Costello, Dick Van Dyke, Steve Allen, Sid Ceasar, Jack Benny, George Burns and Gracey Allen, Jonathan Winters (Robin Williams was the only modern day comic to grave or era), Art Carney, Jackie Gleason, Richard Pryor, Red Fox, Moms Mabley, Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosbie, Flip Wilson. come to think of it we do have many black comedians today and some white dudes.

The expression and movement of CGI- created Ted is still perfectly crafted just like he is truly exist as in first film, the chemistry between Wahlberg and Ted is still strong but the romance in between other characters is rather weak, the performance of all the main casts are good even the new comer Amanda Seyfried just fits well as part of the film. Without much difference from its predecessor, the sequel might not offer any fresh theme but its lightheartedly fun and surprisingly emotional ending is still worth to enjoy at the big screens.",Ted 2
134,supatube,Funny Bear,8,25 June 2015,"""Newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law."" The subtext for this film is rich and one could easily equate Ted's dilemma with most minorities. And the heavy subject matter is handled with crass humor and over the top stoner gems. Did I mention the bear likes to get high? Seth Mac Farlane is known for wit from the TV shows ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" and his step into feature films have, at least from my behalf, always been interesting to watch. He tackled his first feature film, sans the Family Guy characters, ""Ted"" then moved onto, ""A Million Ways to die in the West"" and now ""Ted 2"". His style of humour includes jokes without the drum roll to let the audience know that was a punchline. It's the sitcom without the laughing. Most audiences need to know when the end of the joke has arrived and the lack thereof is a MacFarlane trade that works so well, at least for the fans. And if you're a fan then this second run at the inappropriate little teddy is well worth it.The reference to Amanda Seyfried's eyes (again) is golden. In the western film, ""A Million Ways to die in the West"", is this hilarious scene where Charlize Theron can't believe Amanda is so blind with eyes that big. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Now in ""Ted 2"" they dig even deeper with a visual comparison that leaves me laughing as I write. Keep your eyes out for it.The film did have one too many unnecessary establishing shots, which merely drags a film. Trimming the fat would have made the films pace so much more enjoyable. Here's an example: they're in the hospital room, something goes wrong and they need to move to the waiting room, then there's the establishing shot of the hospital and to the waiting room. The establishing shot was unnecessary because we already know we're in a hospital. Just trim the fat.Other than that Ted 2 is very enjoyable. A great crude comedy that is relentless with the jokes finding ways to pull a giggle from the audience at every given chance.",Ted 2
135,blufrog49,Is this what we have sunk to?,1,9 July 2015,"No spoilers here. I left after about 20 minutes so I couldn't ""spoil"" it for you if I wanted to.If any of you are familiar with my reviews, you know I find the liberal use of the f-word incredibly offensive, especially when some form of it is used at least once in every sentence, and seemingly because the writers don't have a very large vocabulary. The opening scenes are peppered with it as well as a few extremely tasteless ""jokes."" Then the credits roll, with a throwback backdrop of a musical of the Golden Age of Movies, and you think, OK, this could be fun.Then onto more profanity coupled with supposedly funny domestic violence, and a couple of cameos. The first by Jay Leno is embarrassing, then Liam Neeson makes you think there might be enough vignettes like this to make the movie worthwhile. But then the n-word is used. I don't care if it is uttered by a black actress in reference to a white couple. The second time she said it, I walked out.What I REALLY found disturbing is that some other theater-goers found several things to laugh at. I live in a small community, and these are my neighbors?

136,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Ted 2 Review,6,26 June 2015,"My Thoughts:Seth MacFarland movies are always a hard one to critique in my opinion, he tries to walk that line between crass jokes and the ones that make you think. And we get that in Ted 2 but there are times where you just go ""wow Seth that definitely went further in one direction than the other"". Fans of Seth MacFarland will understand what I am saying we either get a Ted movie that everyone seemed to love or we get A Million Ways to Die in the West which people seemed to not enjoy.And lets face it Seth is not that great of a story teller and Ted 2 is another example of that. He rehashes some of the somethings he used in the first Ted, Giovanni Ribisi is pretty much doing the same story in this movie but just in another setting. We also get a rehash of some of the stories he did in Family Guy. Not saying this is all bad it just shows that when he loves an idea he sticks with it and uses it multiple times. Seth is using the story to get to the next joke and not vice verse and that is something we can overlook as long as the jokes that are being told are worthy of it and I will say for the majority of the movie they are but there are times where the jokes do fall a little flat or you just wish they would move along in the story. There is one scene where they are traveling down to New York and one of the scenes just drags, I was sitting there thinking man they could have cut this scene out and it really wouldn't have hurt anything.This seems to be the summer of cameos in movies, first with Entourage and now with Ted 2, and also for Magic Mike XXL (review to come). Cameos in my opinion are not bad if they are used well and Ted 2 uses them well and doesn't. There is a great one that happens at the grocery store that Ted works at that just had me laughing. But then there is one that happens at a convention center where at first I was like ""OMG they got these guys to do this, Awesome!"" but then they took it in a direction that I thought was stupid and really not that funny in my opinion.Ted 2 is a fun ride with a few bumps along the road. My Recommendation:It is a funny movie to see as long as you like the crass controversial humor.",Ted 2
137,agostino-dallas,"Come on, this gotta be funny!!!",8,24 June 2016,"It is creative...it is outrageously funny and so not politically correct1 It has like any movies moments of pure comedy art and moments you realize the director screwed up. I had a ball watching Ted-2 but I think Ted-1 was of course much more spontaneous and sequels are sequels. They are OK but they also need to pay the bills and if creativity is not happening again, just stuff a lot of clichés in the movies and finish the freaking thing. I wish Ted was around when I was like 10, 12...it wasn't. The closest thing I remember being politically incorrect and funny was the movie Airplane-II, back in 1982. I think there is opportunity to Ted-3 but it has to be bold enough to mock politicians; religion and society again!",Ted 2

But not this film very impressed how funny it came out, story line was mediocre but funny scenes made up for it. Usually sequels are over budget big propaganda and it started at first but the funny dialogue and thr hilarious scenes made not only myself but the people at the movie theater, rotten tomatoes rated this a 4.0 what the hell do.they know they always give crappy rating for funny movies, and as soon as they get a check from a crappy movie they rate those high, they are a insult not only to me but to all the real movie buffs so sit back and Enjoy it people Mike Sanchez (popcorn n movie)",Ted 2
139,RustyShacklefordd,2 Hours of Rejected Family Guy Jokes and Stale Pop-Culture References,3,26 June 2015,"I thought the first Ted was decent, enjoyed the first few seasons of Family Guy, and love American Dad. Hell, I even thought A Million Ways to Die in the West was OK. With that said, I thought this was horrible! The first half hour or so was decent, some good jokes and cameos. However, once Amanda Seyfried and the whole plot with Ted trying to be recognized as a citizen starts, it's all downhill from there. This almost feels like less than a movie than 2 hours of rejected Family Guy jokes and stale pop-culture references. The writing here is incredibly lazy and several jokes are repeated multiple times throughout the entire film. Like the first film, there are also a few jokes that are taken straight out of Family Guy. There's even one joke at the end that's taken right from Dumb & Dumber To. My biggest problem though is the fact that it's 2 HOURS when there is absolutely no reason it needs to be! The whole subplot with Giovanni Ribisi served no purpose to the film what so ever and could have easily been cut out and the whole Road Trip segment just felt like an excuse for a really lame weed joke and to crowbar in Seyfried's song. Wahlberg's character and Ted were a lot more annoying and douchier as well which didn't help. I also didn't like how the film shoves in this whole message about Civil Rights after spending nearly 2 hours making a ton of crappy race and gay jokes. That just felt smug of MacFarlane to do. Overall, this was a painfully unfunny and incredibly lazy sequel. Even if you are a fan of the first, I wouldn't recommend it. I saw it with a group of 6 people and none of us liked it. It's stuff like this that really shows that MacFarlane can be a bit of a hack if you ask me.",Ted 2
140,countryshack,This one is terrible!,3,23 January 2016,"We thought that the 1st Ted movie was hilarious but this sequel was just overly filled with adolescent bathroom trash humor. The shame of it is that it had So Much potential but, unlike the 1st one, this movie was littered with adolescent trashy humor. Maybe littered is a little too easy; it was polluted with it. There are some jokes in the movie that were side splitting hilarious only to be followed up by a stream of immature garbage. Mark, once again, did a fantastic job as did most of the cast. It was the writing this time around that gave you the feeling that it was mostly written by high school freshmen who were so stoned that they actually thought that their immature humor was actually funny. So sad.",Ted 2
141,fabiolpinheiro1993,"A great, original, and funny sequel that could be even funnier.",8,7 July 2015,"I loved Ted, while i didn't think it was perfect i think it is one of the best comedies of all time. So of course i wanted a sequel, and i got it...It is just a really great sequel, but i don't think it is as constant as the original, its one of those films where you smile all the time, and laugh a lot, but i think it could be even funnier. The pace is a little off, because there's long stretches of the film where you smile yes, but you should laugh and you don't.The story is great, and it has truly great dramatic moments that would be worth of a great drama. While i didn't like that they passed on Mila Kunis, i loved Amanda Seyfried, she brings a lot to the film.There's many awesome moments, all the characters are back (aside from Mila Kunis) and you will have a truly great time. But if you are not American, like I'm not, you should do a bit of research, because the film has tons of references to American things and celebrities that most of outsiders won't know or understand.This is a must see, and you will have a wonderful time, but i think it could be even more funnier and even more daring. It's a shame the box office pales in comparison to the first film, because i would love to see a another Ted, especially considering how the film ended, and the great story and opportunity to make tons of great laughs,that would have been Ted 3. But i guess everyone else doesn't agree.",Ted 2
142,templar77099,"Ted came, again",5,28 June 2015,"I don't know how, but in what concerns to Seth MacFarlane I always preferred American Dad to Family Guy, and I think that's why I couldn't like this movie more. I liked very much of the first one much because the whole concept was surprising and fresh. With this sequel I believe we are getting the same movie with a bit of improvement in terms of jokes. If you love Family Guy you will love Ted 2. It's practically the same kind of humour, the same kind of gags. If you don't, well, don't even bother to buy the ticket. Ted is almost like Brian, John is Peter Griffin and Samantha is Lois, although I rather preferred Mila Kunis's turn on the first one to the one Amanda Seyfried gives on this one. I just feel like Mila would have given something to the movie that Amanda can't simply give, despite being a very talented actress. It's not that Mark Wahlberg is one of my favourite actors, but I think I 'd rather see him doing this type of film than the Transformers's ones which, I need to be honest, I don't give a crap. I think Wahlberg has this gift to comedy movies which started since Boogie Nights. Jessica Barth is quite a surprise as Tami-Lynn. Once again, and as it happened on the first movie, the show stealer (although there's that Liam Neeson scene, which, in fact, I think was the movie's best) was Giovanni Ribisi as the awkward and misfitted Donny. That ""fresh cakes"" line just killed me. His scenes were the ones I laughed the much, particularly the Comic Con ones. I think that it was a masterstroke to place de climax of the film on this convention, because it allowed to some notably funny gags regarding the so called ""geeks"". Just like the first, Ted 2 is cameo heavy. From Liam Neeson to Tom Brady passing by Sam J. Jones (who had already appeared on the first one). The Liam Neeson one was notably brilliant, in a satire to the more recent roles of the Irish actor. Ted 2 is an enjoyable flick, with the virtues and flaws that you would expect of a summer blockbuster. Just for laughs and the popcorns!",Ted 2

144,shadowyx12,Just another shameless cash grab from Universal Studios.,5,7 July 2015,"The original 'Ted' was the equivalent of lightning in a bottle - at the time, it seemed like something nobody had ever seen before. Only Seth MacFarlane could have come up with a hilarious and bizarre story about an average Joe and his magical talking teddy-bear (who remained his only friend since childhood). The movie became a huge success for both Universal and MacFarlane (making over half-a-billion at the global box-office), and both fell in love with the idea of fast-tracking its sequel.SO now we have 'Ted 2'... and how does it hold up? The reason why the first one did so well was because of its novelty. As I've already mentioned, most people had never seen such a thing before - and were probably hungering for original comedies.Unfortunately, now that the novelty has worn off (at least for me), 'Ted 2' failed to charm me. The overall experience just wasn't the same for me whilst watching the first 'Ted' (and just before this movie too). I'll admit though - there were still plenty of moments when I laughed with the audience.The reason why a lot of the jokes failed for me was because they were just nonsensical. If anyone is familiar with MacFarlane's sense of humour (or 'Ted' or 'Family Guy'), then they'll most likely be in my position of knowing what to expect. Another reason why the jokes failed was because they replicated the cutaway segments seen in 'Family Guy'. The first few are pretty funny, but they eventually get annoying and even start to distract from the main plot.Jokes aside, I have to say that I also really like the direction MacFarlane and his writing partners took the story. Even though there are points in this movie that play out the same way as the first movie, the overall plot is different in both style and theme. While the first movie explores what it means to be you in front of others you love and care for, this movie explores current issues with human rights. These themes, at the very least, actually gives these movies some much needed-depth.The love story between John and and Samantha feels really forced. I'll be honest - even though I'm disappointed (yes, disappointed) that Mila Kunis is gone, I still have to say that Amanda Seyfried did an okay job playing the romantic interest of our newly divorcée... she just does a much better job playing a lawyer.Despite these positive points, 'Ted 2' still pales in comparison with other comedies that have come out this year (namely, Spy). It'll make for a great rainy-day watch.",Ted 2

Now I have to admit that I did get a few chuckles out of this film but for the most part Ted 2 just wasn't as funny as the first Ted film and a lot of the film focuses too much of being a serious story and that's one of the biggest problems with this film. I don't mind that it's got to have serious parts in it but it really was lacking in real genuine comedy which the first film had.Ted 2 I just felt was a really poor sequel that was just very mediocre film and disappointing.",Ted 2
146,Matt-144-792009,A Ted Too Far,6,30 June 2015,"In Ted 2 we rejoin John (Mark Wahlburg) and his foul mouth, pot smoking, fast talking lovable teddy bear Ted, voiced by Seth Mcfarland. In this misadventure, Ted has recently married girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and quickly they realize that their relationship is not exactly better for it. In an attempt to rekindle the flame, they try unsuccessfully to have a child. When that doesn't work, a trip to the adoption agency raises a red flag with the government. Ted is not considered human, but in fact property and thereby unable to be officially wed or hold down employment. Ted and John then meet Samantha (Amanda Syfried) a fledgling attorney who tries to help them argue in court Ted's rights as a human being in the eyes of the law. I have been a long-time fan of Seth Mcfarland. The looks, the voice, the comedy, the acting; is there anything that guy can't do? Although in recent years I have found myself avoiding Family Guy, never could get into American Dad or the Cleveland show. Something about the format has become a little stale. I enjoyed A Million Ways to Die in The West (2013) a great deal and was disappointed to see it was not very well received by critics and audiences alike. The original Ted I thought was hilarious. It was exactly what I expected. Random comedy bits, in the loosely held confines of a plot. Much like you get with any family guy episode. So when Ted 2 was announced, I expected much of the same. Only from the very first few minutes of this movie I felt something had changed. Much in the way new episodes of Family Guy feel. The routine has grown slightly stale. In the opening wedding scene, Patrick Warburton reprises his role as Guy; an almost self-loathing macho homosexual used as a platform for some very weak, offensive for the sake of being funny gay jokes. Then there is a very elaborate Busby Berkley style dance number for the opening credits. What?! Is that an attempt to gloss over the offense taken with a musical number? In the wake of the recent Supreme Court Decision it seems very ill timed. For that matter the rest of the storyline of Ted fighting for his right to legally be considered human and thereby marry his girlfriend seems almost a too close for comfort play on recent news. I think since the plot is a distant second to the gags in this series, another plot might have been more effective. With all that being said, Ted 2 is not without its hilarious low brow comedy bits. This movie nails several great ones for its target audience. There are pop culture movie references to tickle any level of fan boy or girls fancy. There is a Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) bit that had me rolling out of my seat. At one point in the movie the action brings our protagonists to a Comic-Con in New York. A Seth Mcfarland narrative at a Comic-Con is like Jerry Seinfeld doing a movie in an airport or Jim Gaffigan at a grocery store. It's all too easy for him to create jokes that pander to the nostalgia of his target audience. The movie itself is worth a watch for the few good laughs it creates. I hardly recommend spending theater money to see it. Set a look out for this On Demand or on Netflix. Unless you're the kind of person who is still watching family guy re-runs. If that's the case I suggest you put in your retainer, pause the World of Warcraft and ask your mom to drive you to the nearest Cineplex before it's gone.

Well, I didn't give it a one but it's close to it. What is it about Seth McFarlane that studios want to give him money to make feature films? Ted 2, the sequel to Ted, did not bring a hint of laughter to me. I had watched the first film and couldn't sit through it and never had any inclination to watch it again. Now comes Ted 2 and I did the same thing. I though at least this would make up for the first one but it didn't. It left me humorless. With McFarlane's Million Ways to Die in The West, I looked for the funny but sat through that epic lemon without protest. With ted 2, it's just not funny to me. Yeah, I get the joke but these are DOA jokes. The sperm jokes were too easy to telegraph. Who didn't see a cart of sperm falling on Mark Wahlberg must have went to get popcorn. And the dope smoking lawyer was just lazy writing. Why couldn't she have Turrets and have ticks? McFarlane's limited or perhaps overused range of dope, crude humor, drugs and musical dance numbers has its limits to an audience. The musical dance number just laid there for the audience. The silence was just a precursor for things to come.The next time a studio gives Seth McFarlane money to make a film, use it as toilet paper instead",Ted 2
148,peter-stead-740-486963,Mila Kunis was missed,6,11 July 2015,"After watching Ted 2, I watched the first one again same night as it happened to be on TV.I realised that what makes the first one a classic is that it's about a boy becoming a man, without his innocence and identity dying altogether. It's a classic theme everyone can relate to.This is what holds Ted 2 back. Because Mila Kunis isn't in it, it loses that progression, so John Bennett is back to square one. So in place of the theme on growing up, we are eventually introduced to a different kind of theme, that of Ted's rights as a human being. There are parallels made with the emancipation proclamation, but they don't really make the most of this idea and in any case, it's a political, rather than a personal, theme that doesn't do enough for John Bennett's journey. The Ted films work best when it is really about John - with Ted being a symbol of his innocence.So Ted 2 isn't touching in the same way that Ted is, (and I know it seems weird to talk about something as bad taste as Ted as being touching, but it is about a boy and his teddy bear) but that said Ted 2 does have some great comedic set pieces. I was crying with laughter in places and I kind of love it just for that.",Ted 2

I know it's a piece of fiction and comedy by genre, but it so offensive in some scenes and sequences, with unnecessary criticism, offensive opinions, promoting drugs and drug use, laziness and unproductivity, and also childish behavior on a grown adult.

High profile cameos and locations like Comic-Con Great music as expected by Seth. Bigger budget = more awesome action and effects.(-) The plot was fine until the reused antagonist showed up. The movie would have been funny and great without him. Ted got angry, ran away, and got kidnapped... again. Why did it take the Enterprise incident to see Ted had emotions? He displayed all kinds of emotions all throughout his life. He was a big name celebrity when he was newly brought to life and he showed humor and other emotions then. He also showed emotion during the first court case.

154,trvlers-77920,6.3/10,6,28 June 2015,"If you liked the original ""Ted,"" Seth MacFarlane's 2012 surprise smash about a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed teddy bear, then you will probably like ""Ted 2."" It is essentially the exact same movie, and more — and less. As director, co-writer and star, MacFarlane offers a lot of the same kind of brash and ballsy humor that is his trademark. Nothing is off limits. No one is spared. So if you have a problem with a slap-sticky pratfall involving scads of semen, followed by a wildly inappropriate joke about sickle cell anemia, followed by a crass Kardashian reference (and it's a Long way to go for that punchline), then you should probably look elsewhere. I'll admit, I laughed at that joke — and at a lot of the jokes in ""Ted 2″ — but I'm also a longtime fan of MacFarlane's ""Family Guy"" for its energy, daring, rapid-fire pop-culture references and a willingness to go anywhere for a gag. (Our child can recite, verbatim, the entire Brian and Stewie ""Cool Whip"" exchange. We're good parents.) Along with fellow screenwriters and frequent collaborators Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, MacFarlane throws a lot of stuff at the wall. Not all of it sticks. But when it does stick, it works like crazy. As in his television work and the original ""Ted,"" some of the best bits here are the random non sequiturs, flashbacks and fantasy sequences. My favorite joke in the whole movie involves Ted and his human best friend, John (Mark Wahlberg), going to an improv comedy club to yell depressing suggestions to the performers on stage. It's a clever and bizarre idea, well-executed. Having said that, ""Ted 2″ is also overlong, repetitive and self-indulgent. In its attempts at offering a substantial dramatic plot line about civil rights alongside the raunchy comedy, its reach exceeds its grasp. And as in last summer's ambitious failure ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" ""Ted 2″ makes you wish there were someone around to rein MacFarlane in and hone his instincts. There's a brisk and irresistible 95-minute movie somewhere in here, but as is so often the case, MacFarlane cannot contain his excesses, and it seems there's no one around him who can stop them, either. The delightful wrongness of the central premise remains strong, however. Ted (whom MacFarlane voices in a thick, New England accent identical to Peter Griffin's) has married his girlfriend, gum-chomping grocery cashier Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). But John is now divorced from his wife (Mila Kunis, unseen here), and in no time, Ted is having marital troubles of his own. He and Tami-Lynn make the always-wise decision to have a baby to save the union, but since Ted is a teddy bear, he lacks the equipment to impregnate her. When trying to find a sperm donor fails to work — including a truly uncomfortable visit to Tom Brady's house in the middle of the night in one of the film's many celebrity cameos — they try to adopt. But then that doesn't work either when Massachusetts state officials decide that Ted isn't an actual person, but rather a piece of property. This leads John and Ted to seek the help of young, up-and-coming lawyer (and fellow stoner) Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried), who agrees to work pro bono to prove that Ted is indeed a person. The fact that Sam doesn't know who Samuel L. Jackson is — and doesn't get any pop- culture reference these guys throw at her — is a reflection of the fact that she actually studied and immersed herself in the classics and didn't waste her youth sitting on her ass on the couch watching bad television. MacFarlane's detractors often accuse him of misogyny, but as was the case with Charlize Theron's character in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" Seyfried's character is the smartest and most capable person in the room at all times. Forcing her into a romantic subplot with Wahlberg's John seems needless, but Seyfried is game for whatever comes her way. Despite her comic abilities, though, Seyfried is also stuck with some of the heavier material, especially in long, droning courtroom scenes that seriously bog down the film's momentum. MacFarlane may try to liven some of these moments up with a spontaneous song or a profane outburst, but it's impossible to ignore the fact that this kind of meaty writing — this desire to Say Something Important — is beyond him and his team. Connections to civil rights fights throughout history, hearkening all the way to the atrocities of slavery, seem poorly planned and tenuous. Maybe he's aiming for satire, but he never truly hits his mark. But wait, there's more. ""Ted 2″ features another subplot in which Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), the creepy dad from the original ""Ted,"" tries to kidnap the bear at New York Comic-Con to present him to the head of Hasbro (John Carroll Lynch) as the basis for mass production. Nothing in this story line is ever funny or suspenseful; it could have been jettisoned entirely. ""Ted 2″ begins in much more lively and promising fashion than its eventual ending, however, with a wedding-themed, Busby Berkeley-style production number during the opening titles that's beautifully choreographed and hugely entertaining. As in the first film, the integration of this computer-generated creature in a live-action setting is seamless. This is yet another sign that MacFarlane needs to make an old-school musical next — and hopefully if he does, he'll invite some seasoned folks to help him make his ideas truly sing.",Ted 2

(or you're lying about being a true Seth fan, because you'd Know what to expect from him) Ted 2 follows the exact SAME comedic formula as Ted 1! Lots of curse words and sex jokes and no holds barred, to the max! There are Lots of cameos, I was pretty shocked how many people Seth convinced to take part in this movie. The comedy is exactly what you'd expect... crude, nasty, no lines are drawn in the sand. There is obviously drug use and fights and arguments and downright touching moments to balance it all out, as well as plenty of adventure. The plot goes from serious to hilarious many times during the film. But why wouldn't anyone expect that, Ted 1 does the Same thing. Either way, If you're into crude humor that likes to intentionally cross lines and annoy the ""politically correct"", this movie is perfect. And there are TONS of ""F bombs"" in this movie...lots...obviously.",Ted 2
156,kevin-38242,"Same sh*t, different day",5,1 February 2016,"I can't deny it -- I find something inherently funny about a cursing, pot-smoking teddy bear. It's a format where you don't have to do much to get laughs, if the viewer is likely to respond to that kind of thing. If the viewer doesn't see the humour, there really isn't a huge amount that can be done -- these movies do rely on finding an audience with a particular kind of sense of humour.The problem with Ted 2 is that it doesn't really distinguish itself from the original Ted. So, while the jokes still work, if they ever worked, they lack novelty. The film-makes seem to have realized this, and responded by amping up the crudeness and the overall yuck-factor. Fair enough, I guess, but Ted is already as crude and yucky as he needs to be -- enough is a feast, as we say around my way, There's a ghost of a hint of a plot, based around the question whether a talking bear can be considered a ""person"" for the purposes of law. What defines person-hood is an interesting question, and one that lies at the heart of a number of number of contemporary ethical problems. However, this aspect of the movie is treated with such a junior-high (lack of) depth and insight that it's almost offensive. It would perhaps have been better if the film-makers had just cut this stuff and squeezed in some extra knob gags and farting.So, yeah, if you laughed at Ted, most likely you'll laugh at this. But probably not as much.",Ted 2
157,robhigg2203,Manages to squeeze more of a plot there and feels longer than it is but still much of the humour and over the top fun is there,9,17 July 2015,"I was always going to be going into the first Ted as a fan of Family Guy, American Dad and just Seth Macfarlane in general. I can remember first hearing of the premise of the first film, this being some time before the trailer had come online and having no idea what to make of it. And when I saw the first Red Band Trailer and seeing Ted appear on screen for the first time and seeing a character that immediately reminded me of Stewie Griffin, Roger The Alien and with the voice of Peter Griffin I knew this would be Seth Macfarlane (a director who was stepping into the live action medium for the first time) at what we have come to think as his best. And the end result being the first Ted a comedy that pretty much became a huge hit has come to prove that this was the case.This time round the story while still living up to the rude, crude, over the top nature you would go in expecting takes more of a somewhat (and i really do mean somewhat) serious and a elaborate turn. While of course this is still not a movie to be taken to seriously it does contain a number of social commentaries and in a number of moments point out how modern day prejudices are not that different than those of a few centuries ago. While Family Guy in the past has caused a number of controversies with such satires, in this movie the characters only state such moments in history in a way that says although it should not happen again it could easily do so. (Think Brian Griffin had a similar storyline where he wasn't happy about being treated as a everyday house pet) But what these moments lead to is a plot that is more elaborate and actually felt much longer than it actually was. This is not to say that I thought that is dragged on, actually the pace was just right. But this still makes for more of a buddy picture than the first Ted was as we explore more of the relationship of Mark Wahlberg's character and his beloved childhood teddy bear.This relationship is something that helps the humour of these two movies. I can't imagine the kind of imagination it would take to spend the most part of a movie like this interacting with what would have most been a voice behind the camera. Something that is to very much the actors credit. But this movie does gather a great cast delivering their own spin to the kind of daft nature of the movie. But the return of the villain of the first movie, wile still serving more of a key role and serves some kind of purpose felt questionable in his purpose. And yet he also feels just as if not more underplayed than he was throughout much of the first movie.But all these thing still make for a excellent, funny as hell and very heartfelt sequel. As is usually the case it does not quite top the original but still makes to be the kind of second outing you would hope it would be. It is definitely more for those who loved the first movie and will probably not disappoint them either.

However it all goes wrong and Ted is investigated and the state say he is not a person so he loses all his rights job and marriage. Ted than has a court battle to prove he is a person which he eventually wins with the help of John his best buddy and girlfriend lawyer. Such a boring plot really bad. The old enemy Donny tries to get Ted as he is regarded as just Property, in attempt to make Hasbro rich - this gets foiled by john who saves TedThere are some funny bits to the movie, like Jurassic park bit where they see cannabis field and some good one linersHowever the film is looking and trying far too hard for jokes for every line in the movie - rather than naturally funny they try all the time to make one liners a lot of them not that funny.The cute factor of Ted is wearing off and the magic too, I was so bored after the first hour I wanted to leave, the jokes and sarcasm were so predictable.Hopefully no more Ted films but you can guarantee they will make Ted 3 just for the money.Next time have a good plot and story this was very weak.",Ted 2
159,lwood28,An Enjoyable Comedy Sequel,7,6 July 2015,Ted 2 is actually not that bad of a comedy sequel. The chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane is still very good. The jokes in the film are very funny. There are some great cameos in the film especially from Liam Neeson. But there are a few problems with this film. One is Amanda Seyfried's character. I really didn't care for her character and I think they should've picked a different actress for the role or just let her character out of the story. Also the film does have some slow parts to the film and then it gets all serious. Also Giovanni Ribisi's character also shouldn't have been in the film because he wasn't that funny in the film even though he was really funny in the first Ted film. If your not a fan of the first Ted film or Seth MacFarlane's humor then your not going to enjoy this film but if you were a fan of the first Ted film and MacFarlane's humor then you'll enjoy this sequel.,Ted 2

Ted 2 has about as many songs as Frost which, for a film not marketed as a musical, usually is a sign of having too much film and not enough content. This is no exception. The jokes are few and far apart, and the plot so awkward that it almost feels forced and annoying when its brought up.The intro is quite good though, and there are a lot of guest stars.

162,Rageypoo,What the heck did I just watch?,5,4 July 2015,"I gave it a 5 because I managed to watch it the entire way through, but wow this was a struggle.So the movie starts off slow enough, but most of the jokes were just extremely tasteless and the flow of the movie made no sense for the first hour or so of the film. It was mostly one bad line after another, with every one ending on a black dick joke. I will say the opening was pretty cool to watch, I'm guessing they just forgot to add a bit of comedy after that till about halfway through the movie, even the stuff in the previews made me laugh harder than anything because of how they presented it, and I think that's where this movie dropped the ball. In many cases I was making a face going ""wait that made no sense"" and that's never a good sign.Near the end of the movie however the storyline actually picks up and it's not half bad at all, I think they just went a bit overboard with some of the comedy scenes. The cameos they included were great and for the most part I like seeing movies having fun and experimenting with public perception that poke fun at the stereotype to create a laugh, I wish more comedy movies would do this, not only does it help boost a movie that might be dry in some scenes, but adds some light hearted fun to an othewise ""try to hard"" presentation. I can tell you in all honesty if you see this in the theatre you will be wasting your money. If you wait till you can watch it at home or on netflix, it will be a good way to waste a portion of your day.",Ted 2
163,sarandivyam,Review of both parts of Ted- By Divyam Saran,8,28 March 2020,"All things considered, a few motion pictures are with the end goal that they are adored by crowds of each age gathering. The film about which I am going to discuss today falls under that class, Ted and Ted 2.
The film rotates around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who during his youth days, on the event of Christmas Eve wanted that his teddy springs up and it works out as expected. This film at that point manages the further existence of John as a grown-up, how Ted turns into a necessary piece of his life and how he influences his own life.
This film, as I would see it, doesn't exhaust you and holds you till the end. It is pressed with amusement, sentiment, and some exciting activity as well. Although there are some scenes unsuitable for children, for example, when John and Ted smoke together or there might be some private minutes among Ted and his sweetheart, which gives this film an ""A"" rating yet at the same time I see this film as extremely engaging.
The initial segment, Ted (2012), rotates around the life of John Bennett, his relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) and how Ted unfavourably influences their relationship.
The subsequent part, Ted (2015), managed the life of Ted and his relationship with his better half Lynn (Jessica Barth). Right now, the film, Ted likewise faces a personality emergency as the American Government will not consider Ted as a typical individual.
Seth MacFarlane has offered a voice to Ted and has likewise coordinated the establishment. His course is excellent remembering that it is his presentation directorial adventure. The screenplay and the story were additionally generally excellent.
And if I say something about dialogues then they are very well written. Be it be dialogues of Ted too and the dialogue delivery is also really very entertaining and impressive.
This was not the first occasion when I saw a film of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis cooperating. Separately just as together this pair unquestionably functions admirably. I prior saw them in the film Max Payne (2008), where Mark assumes the title job and Mila assumes the job of Mona Sax. I truly regard these individuals as entertainers a great deal.
Seeing a delicate toy come into life is a different encounter for me and I imagine that it would engage all of you as well. Although the film has become very old I think it has not lost its engaging variable.
There are many things which we can learn from every movie and that is the case here too but I would state only one thing which I found out to be the most important. It is based on the priorities set by an individual in his or her life. Priorities are dynamic; they never remain fixed. John should have realized the same point. He should have felt that since he is in his 30s or 40s, Ted should not be his prime priority now. I know Ted is his best friend and they are so-called 'thunder buddies' of each other but they can maintain it but now through a certain distance. He did not realize so which adversely affected his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins and which (though temporarily) spoilt his relationship with Ted, but that's not always the case in real life. Relations in today's world are very tender and need to be taken care of and for that right steps and the right time needs to be taken place to maintain every relation and lead a balanced life.
By and large, these two movies, as I would like to think, merit watching work.",Ted 2

A baby! Ted needs to prove he's a person, in the eyes of the law, to qualify to be a parent.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, it had me crouched over laughing, kept me interested with a steady flow of giggles throughout and what more do you need in this sort of comedy? Its not gonna have Godfather esque acting and directing, its Ted 2! The chemistry between John, (Mark Wahlberg) Ted (Seth MacFarlane) and Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) was marvellous. I especially loved the scene where they looked over the weed farm plantation place and the Jurassic park music comes on that was genius. Supporting cast like Patrick Warburton and Michael Dorn who play gay couple Guy and Rick were excellent who if you like slap stick (tripping people over) comedy than they did it superbly and kept the giggles flowing. Smaller parts from the legends like Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson didn't hurt too. I felt the storyline was interesting enough but the darker scenes with the fantastically cast Giovanni Ribisi as Donny just went away as quickly as them came. Also there was no real substance to those parts of the story, as with the first film it was fresher and had that unpredictability of not knowing how far he would go, with this one you never really got that it just felt like it was shoe horned in to make for a 'baddies' scene. This let the film down for me. The script was top draw through out I personally didn't mind all the weed jokes as long as they were quirky and original, the penis bong I thought was funny and iv touched on the Jurassic park themed weed farm already. The cinematography was notably good as well. I hope this has more re-watchablity than the first after a 3/4 watched of Ted it went dramatically down in my rating.

I would also like to give credit to Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild for their writing.Unlike the first movie, this one actually had a full plot. The plot surprisingly had a good message and went along good with the comedy in this movie.The acting was great too. Like I said Wahlberg and MacFarlane were hilarious.

171,MrPorkuz,A stellar continuation of a promising comedy franchise,7,20 December 2015,"Ted 2 is the continuation of Ted, the comedy that revolves around a grown man and his living teddy bear Ted. Ted 2's humor and scope itself is very much like its predecessors as in it showcases a strong element of crude, derogatory humor which feels fresh for the most part. A main difference between Ted 2 and Ted are that Ted'2 seems to revolve more around Ted himself as he attempts to be recognized as a citizen. The movie starts of very good and the dynamic between Ted and John is as always the most entertaining part of the film. The film does suffer a bit from movie tropes generated from most sequels, in particular the romantic aspect of the film. The film also has many pacing issues, certain parts of the film felt unnecessary and long were as some parts, primarily the end of the film felt very rushed.

172,Muhammad_Nd,Ted's a Better Person Than Many Real People,8,14 July 2016,"When I saw they were coming up with a sequel for ""Ted"", I was, well, not exactly looking forward to more of the raunchiness and overblown use of expletives. Here, they keep things colorful but manage to infuse some deeper thoughts and emotions to give it a stronger heart, and the results are successful.Opening with Ted's wedding and the absurdity behind such a relationship, MacFarlane throws in a magnificent reminder of what cinema can be, with a musical number that explodes with creativity and is a great tribute to some of cinema's golden days. Berkeley is back in full color, and it's a lot of fun. From that moment on, we know ""Ted 2"" si going beyond constant sexual references, and this time we will be dealing with the problems with being rejected, being an outsider, feeling disrespected, and most importantly, treated like an object.There are references to contemporary issues all the times, and the fun thing in the movie is that challenges the audience to use both their brains and their hearts, without forgetting whose dialogue is used to convey these ideas. Ted and company are not delicate, and they love booze, drugs, and trashy comebacks. It's that this time, they're not the spotlight. It's not a cute transformation, just a softer incarnation of what the characters have been. Yes, there is stupidity, but it's not overwhelming like it was in the original. Instead it is used in layers, and within references to other classic films, characters, and important political issues. Yes, there are offensive words, but there is a stronger heart here.We have attorneys of all types, and we see how each kind is well, not perfect, and that makes the movie fun, and even a reference to Freeman's voice reminds us how wonderful an asset to cinema for the last 30 years. We can also see some stabs at pop culture, throughout their visit to the comic convention which reminds us of how fickle a civilization is, and how we take so much for granted.Ted might be stuffed animal that came to life through love, and though he learned some subversive and impolite manners along the way, he has a strong bond to those he loves and respects. He's more of a human than some of the characters in the audience, and this time his message is mirroring contemporary situations, and some people might not be comfortable with the idea. It's funny how love, even with Ted's perspective, can conquer it all and still wink at us while it happens.It's not a perfect movie, but a sure improvement over the original. I'm still amazed at how real his expressions are. I have seen Oscar winning actors who can't even come close to showing emotions the way this bear did.",Ted 2

Ted 2 is exactly the same but, just with a less appealing plot. Starts off very jolly with Ted living a normal life and then he gets into a life changing dilemma that needs to be solved so he can return to that normal life. The overboard humour was very well pulled off and had me laughing throughout. Most of the people enjoyed the sexual jokes in the cinema too. Ted 2 probably classed very highly when it comes to execution of humour. The only downside was some of the actors. It looked very static and emotionless. Although, definitely a hats off to Mark Wahlberg for performing so well in a comedy where he is partnered with a Teddy bear. Overall, it is definitely a film worth while watching.

If you're into family guy, loved the first Ted and had a laugh with 'A Million Ways to die in the West' like I did, it'll give you the laugh out loud moments you desire.

I am very glad to say that Seth MacFarlane truly outdid himself, as I found Ted 2 to be even funnier and smarter than the first film ! Having the story focus on Ted's problems instead of John's means this movie isn't a lazy and boring attempt at cashing in on the success of the first film by having the same storyline with a few twists (I'm looking at you The Hangover !). This is a different, more mature film, albeit with the same characters that we love ! There are still a lot of references to the geek culture and recent news events, but these moments aren't distracting.

Its one thing to trash people for having certain types of personalities and such, but to send some of the msgs he has sent in his shows and in this movie is just disgusting, and unacceptable.

While the film in it's formula and approach are almost identical, which usually isn't a good thing for comedy sequels (think Hangover 2), this movie I find works really well in it's comedy and in it's presentation.The first thing that I enjoyed about this movie is that the drama is really downplayed. There isn't really much focus on the antagonist and the climax is very short. Some may argue that this gives the movie less weight but honestly, I love it. When the drama is present, it is pretty lame, but once again, it's short and isn't the main focus. I'd even argue that the main focus of this movie might not really be on the conflict either, in which Ted is trying to gain his citizenship (an interesting idea in my opinion). The main focus and drive of the film seem to be mainly on it's comedy, as a comedy movie should focus on. The film also appears to not dwell on the love interest so much, which is great. The last film spend most of it's time on it, which is fine. But it just seems like MacFarlane didn't find developing this relationship to be as important, which is also interesting how the plot of the last movie was also discarded. It's odd but not necessarily bad.The acting is alright in this movie. MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg reprise their roles as Ted and John, and do fine jobs. Amanda Seyfried plays the love interest and is alright. I've always found her to be kind of bland, a lot like Mila Kunis, sort of just another pretty face. Patrick Warburton and Michael Dorn play gay lovers and are both hilarious in this movie. Morgan Freeman does his usual role that makes you say, ""well I've seen this 100 times but it's still so damn cool."" The last note worthy mention for me is John Carroll Lynch (Twisty the clown and the husband from Fargo!) who does a good job as the dick head corporate businessman. The rest of the cast is all fine as well.The comedic writing is back full force. MacFarlane still utilizes the same lame cut-away type jokes and in this one it might occur more often. But the difference is some of these cut-aways are hilarious. The scene with the improve group had me dying of laughter and all the pointless scenes with Michael Dorn and Patrick Warburton are awesome, especially the scenes at comic-con. The scene with Liam Neeson might be one of my favorites in comedy history, it's pretty subtle too which is awesome, and it's written beautifully with Neeson saying exactly what you want him to say. But my favorite part of this movie BY FAR is the ending. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE SKIP THIS SECTION. The ending of this film is brilliant. One of my biggest complaints in the last film was the ending, it was lame. My cardinal rule for endings in movies has been, and always will be, that if there is an ending where a character is supposedly dead but then it turns out they're fine and everything is OK, is automatically an 8/10 or lower no matter how good the movie is. It's an awful ""twist"" and it's pisses me off to no end. However this movie did something that I really liked, it made fun of it. I was ready to give this movie a 7/10 just for the ending when suddenly it threw me a curve ball. When John fakes his own death just to scare his friends and Ted, it's honestly so awesome. Unlike the first one, this dark joke fits perfectly with the tone of the rest of the movie and is a really good way to end things in my opinion. Kudos Seth, you got me with that one.In conclusion, I'd highly recommend this movie. It's certainly not for everyone, as most MacFarlane productions are, it's silly and childish and can be offensive at times. But overall this movie is loads of fun and I think that just about anyone can find enjoyment in this movie. Also make sure to stick around after the credits for a hilarious continuation of a previously mentioned terrific bit. I loved this movie and honestly, I can't wait for Ted 3.",Ted 2
178,YoungCriticMovies,Tedibly Irregular: A Film That May Be Hilarious To Some and Insultingly Boring To Others,8,20 July 2015,"I did not like the first Ted movie at all; I completely loathed it and found it an insult to everything imaginable, with not even having a core message attached. So I was extremely surprised to find myself crying of laughter at Ted 2 and I can only come to one conclusion from that; and that is that Seth MacFarlane's comedy is directed at a specific age group, and I just happened to grow into that demographic.Ted 2 starts with the stuffed-animal-come-to-life: Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) marrying Tamie Lynn (Jessica Barth) whom he met at work in the supermarket. We also have John (Mark Wahlberg), Ted's best friend (""thunder buddies"") who mopes around for a year because of his divorce from his wife (played by Mila Kunis in the first film). After the honeymoon stage of Ted and Tamie Lynn's marriage, things start to fall apart really fast. So in order to save their marriage they decide to have a baby, and after an attempt at insemination and adoption Ted is stripped of his human rights and is labeled ""property"" by the state of Massachusetts. This leads Ted and John to sue the government for Ted's civil rights with the help of junkie lawyer Samantha (Amanda Seyfried). There are also minor, almost cameo appearances from John Slattery and Morgan Freeman in supposed supporting roles.Seth MacFarlane's comedy basically consists of being as offensive as possible to everyone. He sort of mocks when other comedies try to maintain a balance of political correctness and making fun of people; so given that if you're going to see one of his films you have no right to complain that he was offensive because that's MacFarlane's cinematic signature. If we don't take the offensiveness and references to Hitler and 9/11 personally you actually find the film to be very funny. Although as I said before, the comedy is specifically directed at the young 18-35 age demographic; the pop culture and even political references were aimed for that restricted age group alone to understand. And so because of that, if you fall outside the intended demographic you will be forced to look at the story for entertainment, and the story is extremely lazy. Basically Seth MacFarlane (who directed and wrote the film) thought of a bunch of funny situations and figured out how to string them together, which is why the film is a court movie/ road movie/ conspiracy film all at once. So of course if you're forced to look at the film's story you will hate the film. But since when does one go to a comedy to admire the way the story was structured? One goes to a comedy to laugh at funny situations, and hey if the story is amazingly structured then all the better. But it's unjust to judge MacFarlane's comedy differently than other general more conservative comedies; in fact I almost admire MacFarlane's comedy style, it's extremely risky and basically is begging people to criticize him for it and that is hard to do in the film world for anyone.In terms of the acting I was very surprised by Amanda Seyfried, who had been off the map of mainstream movies since Les Miserables. I have to say that her role in this film is unlike anything I had seen before; I was used to more conservative comedies like: Mama Mia! or even Mean Girls from her, so when I saw her in this dirtier and certainly more vulgar role I was both surprised and impressed. Seyfried exposes herself to basically be made fun, and she really holds out and almost accommodates her style of acting to the film and their respective actors, so that she was one of the best parts of the film. Wahlberg acted exactly the same as he did in Ted, and that means: he was funny. In fact, I would argue Wahlberg is more of a comedic actor than he is a dramatic actor. Certainly the only dramatic film he went above notable was in The Fighter. But he mostly shines in comedies as opposed to dramas, hell even in The Departed he earned an Oscar nomination for being the constantly angry and sarcastic police officer that was constantly ripping laughs from all of us. As for MacFarlane he was clearly having a blast voicing Ted. I only have the small tic of wanting to have seen more John Slattery and Morgan Freeman, but then again the trio of main actors worked so well on their own, it might have been better to not touch anything.So in the end it's kind of hard to evaluate this film. I guess that if you're younger than 18 or older than 35 you certainly will not enjoy this film, but if you are in that age group, you will have a really good time.",Ted 2
179,Rstein926,So bad but so good,8,6 August 2015,I missed out on watching this film in the cinema but by lucky chance I managed to get this on you tube. This film is just simply BETTER than the original. The two thunder buddies are back and better than ever! Set only a few years after the first film Ted gets married to Tami-Lynn while John is now single once again after Lori dumps him. Ted is on the verge on chewing out his wife but gets advice that a baby will bring them closer together but sadly despite John's sperm donation Tami-Lynn due to drugs is infertile so they decide to adopt. But Ted is deemed 'property' and loses his job as a grocer and his marriage is null and void. John and Ted hire a young girl named Samantha Jackson as Ted's lawyer but Ted loses the case. They decide to go to New York to see the top lawyer but again lose the case and Ted is once again in the clutches of his stalker Donny.This film as I said is better than the first one. But the film is a bit similar to Dumb and Dumber TO especially near the end where John pretended he died to get back at Ted after he tricked John into thinking he was retarded. The film though was also a bit disgusting and a bit vulgar but of course this is a Seth MacFarlane movie.I think it was disappointing Lori was not in the film but Samantha was not that bad and she was kind of like Brian Griffin's ex girlfriend Julian 'Jelly Bean' as both are dumb blonde's as in a running gag Samantha doesn't know anything about pop culture.Overall the film was better and more amusing than the first one. I am dying for a Ted 3 and I hope Lori comes back!,Ted 2
180,SirBurgh,Could have been (a lot) better,6,26 June 2015,"There were a lot of funny bits in this movie, but when you hear one sex joke after another for the entire movie (especially the first 30-45 minutes) it just gets disgusting and old. I alternated between having some good laughs and wanting to just get up and leave.Also why does every recent comedy have to throw one gay reference after another at us? We get it Hollywood - you want to desensitize everyone to gay men. Take a deep breath and give it a rest.If movies like this just resisted the urge to go to the well over and over with the same tired jokes, and stuck to what made them funny in the first place, they would be so much better. I still think the concept of Ted is great and there were enough good jokes to make it funny, but I'm not sure I'd even watch it again because of the cringe factor from all the raunchy jokes.",Ted 2
181,kimura-toyo,7/10,7,13 July 2015,"If you enjoyed the first Ted movie, you'll definitely enjoy this one. It had about 3 laugh out loud moments, and I don't remember the last time laughing that hard in a movie theater. The movie starts off at a good pace and with good humor but slows down a bit in the middle-the end. And I can see how Seth Macfarlane purposely slowed the pace down and focused on certain aspects of the movie to try and reel you in so you get more emotionally attached to the characters. Didn't quite work for me, but the laughs were well worth it. There were some great cameos and plenty of mainstream analogies. Go in with no expectation and you'll enjoy it.",Ted 2
182,starry42,"Not as funny as the first one, but it does have a good message.",6,26 June 2015,"The first Ted was a major surprise for me. I thought it looked stupid from the trailers, but when I saw it I couldn't stop laughing. Having been a fan of Family Guy for a long time, I was not sure what to make of Seth MacFarlane's feature film debut. It was a success, so a sequel was bound to happen at some point.When I first walked into Ted 2, I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be funnier than the original, or just a waste of time. Well it was actually neither. What it is, though, is a subtle commentary on civil rights.In the film, Ted (voice by Seth MacFarlane) is seen by the US government as nothing more than a piece of property. With the help of his thunder buddy John (Mark Wahlberg) and a young lawyer named Sam (Amanda Seyfried), Ted goes to court to fight for his rights as a human being. This is the main plot point, but there are a few subplots thrown in, such as finding a sperm donor so Ted and his wife Tami can have a baby, and a return by creepy bear-o-phile Donny (Giovanni Rabisi). I did not find myself laughing quite as much in this one as with the first. Some of the jokes were a bit predictable this time around, and some even seemed forced. Probably the highlight of the humor is a hysterical cameo which I will not divulge.Bottom line, it has a good message to it if you like films with a moral, but if you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane who is hoping for nothing but non-stop laughs, then you may be a tad disappointed. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I'd say it's more worth a rental when the time comes. Not really anything to rush to the cinema for.",Ted 2
183,sil328,Laugh out loud moments but why the incessant drugs and swearing,8,18 February 2018,"I have to confess that while watching Ted 2 I laughed out loud - something I rarely do when watching a film - more often than I did during Ted 1, or any other film I can remember for many years. The dialogue is fast and snappy and although much of it doesn't hit the mark, when it does, it is hilarious.Yes, the characters do things no-one would do in real life, but then in real life no-one would have a talking teddy bear. However, I did find the relentless cruelty and bullying by the gay guys from Star Trek a little over the top and unnecessary. Likewise the almost constant drug-taking. It seems almost expected these days that any Hollywood film will have most of the main characters constantly taking drugs, and I don't really know why no-one has suggested that this might not actually be helping young people wean themselves away from drugs - it really isn't helping society. ""Oh look, all the people we look up to and who earn lots of money are spending almost every day drugged out of their minds yet they seem to function perfectly well. Can't be anything wrong with it then!"" I'll bet the drug barons are rubbing their hands with glee every time a Hollywood film rolls off the presses these days and yet more characters are seen snorting lines of cocaine as though it is the most normal thing in the world. By all means have Ted and John smoking weed now and again, but it's all they seem to talk about, and pretty much every time they stood still out came the apparatus for another hit. Too much! They were perfectly funny when they weren't smoking, they didn't need the drugs.Certainly didn't need all the swearing either - completely unnecessary and the sign of lazy writing. I don't know why writers think by adding the f-word into sentences where there is absolutely no need for it eg 'How about we get some effing breakfast' makes it any more entertaining to listen to. People don't all talk like that, it just makes the film less realistic and frankly depressing.The more films keep promoting incessant swearing and drugs, the more people will start to think it is acceptable. It isn't! Stop it!!Apart from that, I really enjoyed this film. It didn't drag despite being quite long, and although some scenes were a bit silly, there were not too many massive plot holes or daft character behaviours and the majority of it worked.",Ted 2

I bought Ted 2 one day and I didn't know that there was a sequel, so I was very excited. I went into it with high hopes, like I do with a lot of bad movies, and it was un BEAR able, (I'm sorry, I had to). It was a bad movie, honestly. A couple of the jokes were mildly funny, and the movie didn't make you bored, but most of the jokes and gags were just loathsome. Overall, I didn't like this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it.",Ted 2
185,info-15-396609,Love this franchise!,10,26 December 2015,"Vulgar, irreverent, politically incorrect, offensive to all cultures in every way possible, hysterical. A brilliant civil rights vehicle! Bravo! A must see! I wondered when the film started out... Are they going to far? Have they gone off the rails? Has one of my favorite new conceptual franchises lost it's plot??? I hung in there, and so glad I did. With science fiction and fantasy as the two main genres used for spreading political, spiritual and intellectual enlightenment, it's sure nice that CGI is being used to animate stuffed toys for a darn good reason— to school us about what has become of Western Society. Sure other animated films have done this, but not with a Teddy Bear wielding a comedy baseball bat. Aside from that, I just couldn't understand how two button eyes and a plush toy face was able to communicate such a wide range of emotion! Kudos to the special effects guys!!!! (Don't underestimate what it took for them to pull this off.) Great writing, directing and acting throughout! Can't wait for Ted 3! Thanks!!! WARNING: If you can't handle a lot of swearing, even if it's to make a huge point... you may not get through this film. (But it's worth it!!!)",Ted 2
186,r-kerr0992,"An enjoyable, but safe extension of the original",5,29 July 2015,"OVERVIEW As everybody knows there are not a lot of movies that cope with 'sequel syndrome', shadows of the original and usually an underwhelming experience. You get one of three sequel types; those that come up with a new way to tackle the formula creatively and successfully, those that borderline ridiculousness and disappoint, or those that play it safe and go for more of the same. Ted 2 mostly falls into the third category.The set up is pretty standard, Ted marries his girlfriend Tami-Lynn, and they have a bit of a rough start to their lives together. To try and give their relationship some meaning they decide they want to have a baby. However, it is revealed that by law Ted is property and does not share the same rights as a human, in regards to parenting a child and being married. Wanting justice, they hire a young intern lawyer to fight in a court of law.First thoughts throughout the movie was I was generally laughing every third or fourth joke, it kept me entertained and engaged. However, when jokes fell flat, they really fell flat. Not so much some one-liners but even the comedic set pieces. The slip that caused the shelf of sperm samples in the Fertility Clinic to fall on John just felt really bland, not really any substance. However the parting joke of the scene did make me laugh. 'You 're covered in rejected, black guy sperm, just like a Kardashian'. I also got this feeling in the opening credits scene with Ted doing a instrumental dance number that just wasn't funny or interesting and went on for about five to ten minutes. There was also a lot of recycled moments from Family Guy, like the scene in the car where Ted is driving dangerously to 'Mess Around' by Ray Charles was done (which is a reference to the great Planes, Trains and Automobiles).This leads me onto my next point of pop-culture references. Now I understand that you can make comedy out of modern day observation when done correctly (like older seasons of Family Guy), but there were times where it wasn't really a joke, just a mentioning of something of relevance to today. No context, really. There is one scene where Ted, John, and the attorney Samantha where preparing in a library for the big court case, where they were dancing and goofing around and possibly a reference to a music video, I didn't even know what it was, but it was just so flat. On the other hand there were sequences that did make me laugh and were used appropriately that I'll touch on next.NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS There were two moments that I remember distinctly for different reasons. One was a stupid but funny scene where Samantha sings a song around a campfire and all woodland critters come to watch her sing, poking fun at some old and modern Disney movies. The ridiculousness of the animals that come to watch her was quite funny, with the stereotypical rabbit, bear, on the other end a fish jumping out of stream and suffocating to listen, and a random close-up of lobster. It was silly but I have to admit it did make me laugh.Another scene was the big fight that took place during Comic-Con. All nerds dressed up as different comic book and TV characters in a huge brawl. It was funny seeing old Dinosaurs from the very first Star Trek episode slowly swinging for each other, and a man in a Dragonball Z costume trying to turn Super Saiyan. It was funny, and I enjoyed it.PERFORMANCES In all honestly the only standout in the whole film was Mark Wahlberg, everybody else was just lackluster. I don't really like Wahlberg that much as a serious actor but he is really good in comedies. One of the funniest moments of the film was when Mark Wahlberg smoked ridiculously strong Marijuana and was scared to walk down the street without holding onto a wall. He handled it really well and it seemed like he was trying.FINAL VERDICT I have to admit when I left the cinema I felt moderately entertained, nothing really standout or clever throughout the movie but it did make me laugh. However, almost every joke throughout the movie contained a pop culture reference, some that worked and some that didn't. But all the same it is just lazy, there is no denying it. There is no setup or payoff in set pieces, things just happen because they do. I do accept that it is all that Seth MacFarlane writes, and he isn't clever enough to pull off a original concept with tight dialogue and well-constructed comedy like i.e. Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park,. But to award it any more than just an really average movie that I get some easy laughs from would be unjust. Was I satisfied? For the most part I was entertained. Would I watch it again? Probably not.",Ted 2

I've now watched it three times and it's a movie that rewards with more laughs on repeat viewings. Sure the crude humour won't be to everyones taste but then you already know that if you watched the original movie. I've read that some see the movie as suffering from the absence of Mila Kunis but in fact Amanda Seyfried comfortably filled her shoes and even added to the lead female role.

Hollywood can sometimes overly complicate things. Mark Wahlberg is one of the main characters and just happens to be a great actor as well. What is more remarkable is that the story is actually a court room drama, but involving characters that are so ridiculously lovable as to transform the story into a spoof, which works as comedy. There is an edge to the humour, which makes it even funnier. Just because Ted is a toy doesn't mean he lacks feelings or a sense of humour and wittiness.",Ted 2

They are a specific genre just like Action, Sci-fi, Drama etc. And what is the main thing this genre needs to produce? It needs to produce fun! It needs to make you laugh. It doesn't need to have great plots, twists, actions and such. I rate comedies on how much they made me laugh. I look at this genre in another way than other genres. And trust me, this movie made laugh more than a few times. It had great jokes, to be honest with you. It referenced movies from the past and made jokes about them. It was really fun from the very beginning to the end. I didn't get bored, not even a little bit. It exceeded my expectations because the first Ted movie wasn't that funny. Well this one is twice as good. I never thought that I would give a 9/10 for this movie but it was really funny, it made me laugh so many times and I haven't seen such a good comedy in a while.

The cast were terrific, with Mark Wahlberg, Seth Macfarlane and Amanda Seyfried in the lead roles, I knew we were in for an interesting comedy. I'm not a big fan of Mark Wahlberg and Amanda Seyfried but this pairing worked very well in Ted 2. Of course they had to have Liam Neeson in it and Morgan Freeman too. Whilst some of the jokes were sloppy, some of the sexual references were funny as hell, very crude and very funny. Sometimes I wonder how these sexual references and crude imagery on-screen actually passes as a 15 certificate but there we go. Overall, an incredibly funny film, a gag a minute.

It was filled with immature poop jokes and sexual references, that are funny to all the immature 5 year olds in the audience.

Let me also state that i actually like Family Guy. i think its a really funny and well written show. But the writers of this, must have been on crack when they made it.

So I was somewhat skeptical going into this movie because generally sequels get worst as they go especially in franchises like this. This movie is BAD! It wasn't nearly as good as the first one and featured stupid jokes that didn't even work most of the time and that just fell flat. The only good parts where the cameos! It is a cheap rehash of the original that is really dumb and not funny. Do not waste your precious time on this movie and save your money for something else.

This review is honest, that in most parts of the movie it was funny as hell. The jokes are fresh and very different from that of Ted 1, and in fact I think it has a better ending than Ted 1 too. On the other hand, it is a little more serious than Ted 1, nevertheless, the humor of the movie is maintained throughout, which is the purpose of a comedy. This gave me as much laughs as Ted 1 did, and MacFarlane successfully delivers a comedy different and much better than the others. In conclusion, I think you should absolutely watch it and you will have a good time, unless you're a boring a** person who loves to criticize the hell out of things. This movie is highly underrated, and even though I'm a man who hates comedies, and I didn't like Ted 1 much, though I loved The Hangover 1(1 only) and Borat(Not the Dictator), I highly recommend you watch it, and have a good laugh.",Ted 2

For two hours movie, a few moments passed without laughing, other than that, it was hilarious.... I missed most of the movie while I was laughing. What is funny about Ted, the statements he says in the incorrect time, in Ted 1, what made me laugh most is when Donny holds him and starts running, but what Ted cares about at that time is the voice of the fat kid running This is what is funny about TedNow I will be waiting for Ted 3, and other movies from the voice of Ted ""Seth MacFarlane""",Ted 2
204,dan_vez,Lots of good laughs without feeling brainless!,9,14 December 2016,"Often when I watch comedies, I accept that the movie is just going to be another brainless movie with excessively stupid jokes and absolutely nothing to get out of it. I was pleasantly surprised by Ted 2!! Not only can you enjoy a lot of stupid jokes and have lots of good laughs, you can also, consciously OR not, reflect about moral ethics issues and reinforced good moral values. I believe absolutely no movie should be completely brainless, and no matter how stupid are the jokes, they're should some underlying good principles hidden in the plot.Ted 2 was a good comedy to watch. Perfect when feeling bored and you just want a laugh while being slightly distracted. Perfect when you want to relax while not feeling dumbed- down at the end of the movie. This is probably the smartest a non- serious movie can get while still consisting of mainly stupid jokes and one- liner. Beside Ted, the movie remains as realistic as it can try to be for its kind.I most definitely recommend this movie! Especially if you're in a good mood but bored.",Ted 2
205,himynameisart,"If you liked the 1st ted you'll love it, if you didn't well you won't like this one either.",7,30 June 2015,"Ted 2 lets talk about it! OK i saw this film 2 months ago at an early screening and unlike a few idiots on here i actually kept my mouth shut due to the embargo and quiet possibly getting sued if i let any info slip lol. Anyways i ENJOYED this movie a ton!!! Let's get one thing straight here, if you didn't like the 1st TED or you don't like anything Seth Mcfarlane related then STAY AWAY! This movie isn't for you and it won't change your mind about anything. I LOVED the first ted and i knew that this movie might be a weak sequel like most sequels are now in days...... and surprise, surprise it actually exceeded my expectations. Ted 2 is almost as good as the first! ALMOST! One of my concerns was the cast change, i hate when movies replace or change characters in sequels. SO i felt that Mila Kunis's absence was going to be very obvious and there would be a hole in this movie that the new lead Amanda Seyfried just could not fill. AND another surprise! Her character worked to PERFECTION!!! The chemistry that she had with Mark Wahlberg and Seth Mcfarlane was just amazing. I was like ""there's no way she could be better than Mila"" and BOOM she nailed it.The story most of you may already know from the trailers, Ted gets married and then the State says Ted is property and not a person so the marriage is annulled and he basically loses everything. So the story worked, the first movie focused more on John and this one is more about ted. I had no real complaints with this film, there is a cameo with Liam Neeson which IMO was just pointless and not that funny.... There are some moments where they try too hard with the jokes or to be shocking but Besides a few nitpicks i had no complaints with this movie! It is laugh out loud funny, it has serious moments similar to the first and it's just a fun film! There are some returning characters and i won't spoil that. And ohh yeah the Comic Con scene in this film with Patrick Warburton and the running gag they have going on is SUPER HILARIOUS!!! I'm giving TED 2 an 8.5/10.",Ted 2
206,robertyaniz-41545,'Ted 2′ Proves Why Comedy Sequels Are So Tricky,6,21 July 2015,"With the story a jumbled mess of subplots that half-work, what saves Ted 2 is its moment-to-moment gags. The film unfortunately does reference the first film far too many times, offering variations or callbacks to jokes that worked better before, and even re-uses a couple jokes that will feel all-too-familiar to fans of MacFarlane's Family Guy. That being said, there is still enough juice left in the characters of Ted and John to help audiences forget the episodic structure and pointless nature of some of Ted 2's early plot developments. A handful of big stars make memorable cameos (no spoilers here!), and the film does move at a brisk-enough pace to distract from the larger issues the film faces in telling its story, allowing its go-for-broke approach to be fun even when it's not laugh- out-loud funny.For the full review, visit my site.",Ted 2

A Chilled Out Must Watch.,8,5 August 2015,"If you have watched Family Guy, if you are familiar with Seth MacFarlane's prior works, if you know the type of comedy he goes with, this is a must watch. You will fall in love with this movie from the very first minute, guaranteed. Even if don't know who this Seth guy is and what's a Family Guy, chances are you will become a fan of his after watching this.From the start till the end this movie won't stop making you laugh whether by it's pop culture references, celebrity jokes or down right slapstick comedy. It's like watching a movie based in the Family Guy universe. It doesn't shy at making fun of anybody or about anything. This is one of those rare movies where the plot takes a backseat in lieu of the laughter riot going on but still its quite strong and makes a point, sort of, I don't know, I might be high!

209,cyrusramsey,Funny but disjointed,7,20 August 2017,"First of all, if you're reading this, I assume you saw and enjoyed the first Ted movie. The good news is that Ted 2 has a lot - and I mean a lot - of the off-color humor that characterized Ted 1. Ted and Johnny smoke weed a lot, watch TV a lot and say ""fuck"" a lot. If you thought Ted 1 was funny, chances are you'll find this movie funny as well.Now for the bad news: while it has lots of good moments, this movie does suffer from a mild case of ""sequel-itis"". It doesn't fit together as well as the first movie did, there are quite a few scenes that don't move the plot along at all and would work just as well as standalone comedy skits. The movie also falls short of Ted 1 in a few other ways. So let's figure out exactly what's wrong with this movie:1. Mila Kunis isn't in it. Now, technically this flaw applies to all movies that don't have Mila Kunis in them, but in this case, it makes a noticeable difference. Mila's character was often the voice of reason in the first film, and while Amanda Seyfried's character in Ted 2 is hugely entertaining, she is as goofy, if not goofier, than Ted and Johnny. 2. In the first film, Ted and Johnny were obnoxious and vulgar, but essentially good-hearted. In Ted 2, our heroes and their friends seem to have lost their kind touch, and descended into simply being unhindered assholes. They harass strangers for fun, cause at least two vehicle accidents and make one or two mildly racist, sexist and homophobic jokes - hardly surprising, considering Mark Wahlberg's past, but still a letdown. 3. For some reason, this movie decided to try and be a legal drama as well as a screwball comedy. While it manages not to get too boring, there are still one or two courtroom scenes that feel out of place in this movie, to the point where it's a relief when the protagonists inevitably start shouting obscenities. 4. There quite a few running gags that feel very forced and unnatural. The celebrity cameos are also fun at first, but get a bit old after a while. 5. The ending seems a bit anticlimactic, especially after the brilliant ending of the first film. It mostly fits the characters, but it seems tacked on and pointless, and missed the obvious opportunity to be much cleverer than it was. 6. They don't sing the Thunder Buddy song.Now, just for the sake of fairness, let me point out some of the utterly brilliant things in this movie that make me love it in spite of its flaws: 1. There are a couple of scenes that parody other films in utterly genius ways. I won't name any names, but if you're at all familiar with the biggest films of the '80s and '90s, you should have no trouble getting the references. 2. Ted really comes into his own as a character in this movie. The first film, despite its name, was really about Johnny, but in this one, Ted really is the one we're supposed to identify with, and Johnny feels almost like Ted's sidekick more than the other way around. 3. Amanda Seyfried is fantastic in this movie, and manages to fit in perfectly with Ted and Johnny's weird rapport. She has a few specific moments that really improve the film overall, and while I won't spoil anything, I will say that this movie would have mostly sucked without her. 4. They don't sing the Octopussy song.In conclusion, if you enjoyed the first Ted, I think you'll enjoy this one. It doesn't really work as a standalone film, but few sequels do. As long as you don't expect it to be better than the first film, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Ted 2

211,Lingstar7,A MacFarlane barrel of laughs,8,8 July 2015,"Well, where do I start?! I think it has to be with this advice: If you don't like the first Ted, Family Guy or anything else from Seth MacFarlane's repertoire, you won't like this film. If you are easily offended, you won't like this film. If swearing makes you cringe, you won't like this film. If, like me, you adore the MacFarlane humour, you will be just fine! Ted 2 is just as funny as it's predecessor. Full of jokes from beginning to end with an story that plays out to a satisfying conclusion. The film begins with Ted's wedding to Tami-Lynn, strong humour from the start and we're told early that Lori (Mila Kunis) won't be returning as she and John (Mark Wahlberg) have divorced. This sets up a temporary mirror of the first film where John was loved up and Ted was alone. We leave the wedding and go into the opening credits which house one of the largest and most impressive dance routines I have seen in a while! Once the film continues post-amazing dance, Ted and Tami-Lynn have reached a tough spot in their marriage. A colleague suggests that they have a baby to fix their problems (I hear that works for just about everybody) and the crux of the story begins. As Ted can produce children he tries a series of methods to find a donor before moving onto adoption when they find out Tami-Lynn can't have children either. It is at the adoption centre the couple are informed that they can't adopt due to Tami-Lynn's drug convictions and the fact that Ted is not technically a person. (This was all much funnier than I've made it sound, I am actively avoiding joke spoiling as there is nothing worse than knowing all of the jokes before you see the film!) Ted's life falls out from under his own feet as he is deemed property by the government and here begins Ted's war on civil rights. To say more about the film would give away too much and as somebody that hates people spoiling everything in a review I will leave the plot description here.Amanda Seyfried is great in Ted 2. She isn't afraid to poke fun at herself and it looks like she's having a blast on set, I wouldn't be surprised to see her return if any further sequels are made. Mark Wahlberg once again brings his strongest Boston self to the table and continues to act pretty damn well considering a lot of his interaction is with a CGI bear. We see Morgan Freeman a little later into the film and although he's not doing anything too different to his normal roles, I will never grumble at seeing the man on screen. Giovanni Ribisi returns as creepy villain Donny and surpasses himself with his ability to make my other half cringe in her seat (she's pretty easy to weird out!) There are loads of celebrity cameos but I'll leave it to you to see them for yourselves. They're all funny but there is one in particular that tickled me more than any of the others! At 115 minutes, Ted 2 did run a little longer than I would like. I was starting to get fidgety towards the end but luckily the humour was consistent enough throughout that I didn't lose any interest. The screening I went to was almost full and there were quite a lot of American pop culture jokes that went over the head of the UK audience. I caught pretty much all of them but I'm a pretty big fan of all things American. I imagine those jokes will kill in the USA but to those of you in the UK, don't worry if you're a little lost occasionally, you're certainly not alone! As I said at the beginning, if you enjoyed the first Ted film or any of the other work of Seth Macfarlane, check this out and enjoy the laughter.",Ted 2
212,theycallmejudo,"Promising start, disappointing finish.",6,22 July 2015,"Firstly if I was rating this movie I'd give it 6.5/10, but IMDb doesn't allow that so I'm going to have to go for 6/10.The first half of Ted 2 is hysterically funny. And I mean HYSTERICALLY funny. The Liam Neeson scene had me in tears it was so funny. The sperm bank scene was brilliant. For the first half legitimately brilliant jokes were being fired out left, right, and centre. If I was rating the movie in two separate halves then the first would easily get 9/10. For the entire first half I was wondering how Ted 2 was getting such negative reviews. Then the second half started. The second half I would give 5/10, maybe 6/10. I don't write reviews often but the second half of Ted 2 made me so mad that I felt compelled. I would consider the second half to be from when Ted makes his first appearance in court onwards. The movie completely lost it's way and it's quality plummeted. For some reason that god only knows the writers decided to turn Ted 2 into some sort of dramedy that felt more drama than comedy. Sure there were the occasional laughs but for the most part the movie became far too serious. I cannot think of one single joke in the second half that could compete with anything in the first half. The romance between John and Samantha felt somewhat forced to me, bringing Donny back wasn't a good idea, and the whole Comic Con scene felt stupid.So to sum up: The first half of Ted 2 is funnier than the entirety of Ted 1, however it's second half takes a sharp downward slope into mediocrity. In my opinion, Ted 2 was a missed opportunity to make a truly great comedy.",Ted 2
213,kingneudy,Not worth it,3,29 June 2015,"Not even close to (Ted), which few movies can replicate that strategy, but this one bombed badly. I debated on staying through till the end.

Save your money, your time, and just accept that this one isn't that great.Don't get me wrong, this movie had some good zingers and a few funny moments. However, it just looked as if the crew was trying so hard to make us laugh.

As everything that comes from Seth's brilliant piece of mind, this film just goes ahead and pees on society,then turns around and lets off a big loud one on its face. Boom. No censorship.Ted 2 certainly won't make a better person out of you, nor intentionally evoke revealing insights or epiphanies, let alone shake the foundations of your deep soul.

219,ChetNick,This is worse than the time..,3,14 July 2015,"Seth MacFarlane's foul-mouthed teddy bear is back for a second installment in Ted 2. Accompanying him is his stoner best-friend John (Mark Whalberg) and his stoner attorney Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) as they smoke weed and try to prove in a court of law that Ted is a sentient being entitled to his civil rights. Did I mention they smoke a lot weed? The film is riddled with the type of crass humour we have come to expect from Seth Macfarlane, the anything-goes creator of Family Guy. The opening half hour has the Seth MacFarlane stamp thoroughly imprinted throughout, with race jokes, sexual innuendo and enough swears to make Quentin Tarantino blush. The problem with Ted 2 isn't the number of offensive jokes (if anything the second half could use a lot more). Where the movie runs to ground is with it's terrible pacing. Ted 2 is three different movies rolled into one. We have the main storyline, where Ted takes on the courts to prove that he is a person and not someone's property. Subsequently there is the kidnapping subplot, (recycled from the first movie) in order to pry open Ted and see what makes him come to life (which if you've watched the first movie, we already know the outcome of). On top of it all we have the blossoming romance between John and Samantha.While Macfarlane is known for using sentimental moments, here it feels overbearing and really slows the film down. Mark Whalberg was likable enough in the first movie and had plausible chemistry with his love interest Mila Kunis, who came to her senses and did not reprise her role in the sequel. Without her, he is just along for the easy paycheck. By the end, whatever thoughtfulness the movie scored based on sentimental value is lost in a shambolic, slapstick Comic-Con finale, starved of laughs.When you go to an MA movie staring a drug abusing, foul-mouth teddy bear, you expect more. It seems apparent that Seth wants to move on from just doing comedies and is trying to instill his range – and this is not the place to do so. Ted 2's redeeming qualities come in the form of a few funny cameos and the odd side gag (reminisced of Family Guy's cutaways gags). 3.5/ 10",Ted 2

I just saw this yesterday in the theater with my friends and we loved it a lot! When you see the first couple minutes you think to yourself ""Okay, this is just going to be filled with big cameos and will be dumb..."" It's not like that at all! The story really got going after the whole Tom Brady part. (I don't want to spoil anything) Seth Macfarlane is a genius doing this type of movie. You will laugh throughout the entire movie from beginning to end. Not only is this movie hilarious, but it has a completely different story. I guarantee you will leave the theater feeling great! Everybody keeps saying ""Seth Macfarlane isn't funny anymore."" I completely disagree! I actually think his movies are really hilarious and have a story to be told in a good different way just like Trey Parker and Matt Stone do with South Park.

226,cmanrockon,"Funny and fun, but with no sense of direction",7,31 March 2016,"In its purest form, Ted 2 is a very Seth McFarlane comedy continuing the chronic chronicles of an unusual pair of Bostonian best friends.As you may recall from its predecessor, Ted 2 tells the story of John, played by Mark Wahlberg, and his talking teddy bear, voiced by Seth McFarlane, as they lackadaisically deal with life a few decades after Ted's coming to existence via a Christmas miracle; in this episode, however, the duo encounters more problems, featuring Ted's obvious infertility, the nullification of his marriage, and his legal status regarding human life? The story jumps around quite a bit, but it's more or less exactly what we would expect from a Seth McFarlane movie.By now, we've seen both extremes from McFarlane's movies – the good from Ted, and the bad and the ugly from A Million Ways to Die in the West – so when this sequel came around, I entered the theater without any real expectations other than some solid comedy and some similar chemistry between Wahlberg and McFarlane. What I got, I might add, was somewhere in that ballpark. The story felt a bit more fun and even lighthearted than the original Ted did, in that the overall tone of the film was less dark, and the story was a bit more of an outlandish adventure than its predecessor. For all you film buffs out there, this phenomenon is known as the Evil Dead effect, and although it is not omnipresent throughout the film, it's often the first thing that I think of when I look back on this movie.But what about the comedy? I mean, that's what you're here for, right? Well, Ted and Johnny's back-and-forth dialogue is just as entertaining and fluent here as it was in the previous film, and many of the jokes are even bigger and had me laughing even harder as well. On top of that, a lot of the comedy is incredibly up-to-date and relevant, thus making many of the jokes more shocking, unexpected, and hilarious. However, there were two comedic sources in the film that many viewers have had mixed reactions about, and those sources are cameos and spoofs. Being a fan of many of the same things that Seth McFarlane enjoys (e.g. jazz music, movies, television, and comedy), I particularly appreciate seeing his take on a number of pop culture icons, including Jurassic Park, Trix cereal, and Morgan Freeman, just to name a few. These jokes aren't particularly visionary, but I find great pleasure in seeing many of these references and familiar faces in a new, comedic light. Even if that means ripping off Planes, Trains, and Automobiles for the tenth time in his career but John Hughes never gets old. Sorry too soon?This film's greatest flaw lies in the fact that its plot was far from consistent. It became very evident to me that in the storyboarding phase, people just kept building off each other's ideas and saying, ""Yeah, let's go with that, and then we'll throw that in there, and oh! – this would be funny too!"" In that regard, it makes it harder and harder to consider this a good movie, as opposed to just another episode of Family Guy. Additionally, it was frustrating to see that Mila Kunis did not return for this sequel, for her absence completely undermines so many of the good messages and plot points that Ted actually had. That being said, Amanda Seyfried still did a nice job of stepping into the spotlight as a new character and adding a new personality to the gang, but it didn't change the fact that the plot remains such an inexcusable mess. The movie winds down as the filmmakers must have run out of time or ideas, so finally, when the action kicks up in the last act of the film, you find yourself watching something that you expected to see the whole time, and it just isn't as original or inventive as the rest of the ""Ted"" movies have been. Also, their attempts at drama near the end are frustrating and a bit derivative, yet the scene somewhat makes sense in comparison to the first film.All in all, Ted 2 was a lot of fun to see – it had its hilarious and moderately funny moments, and the music was fantastic as per usual, but the overarching plot was certainly sub-par to say the least. So if you and your potentially existing friends are looking for something fun to watch and aren't particularly concerned with admiring a work of cinematic art, then Ted 2 will be worth your time to sit back and enjoy. And if you're a big McFarlane fan already, chances are you won't care about the plot anyway, and you'll have a lot of fun with this movie.

228,Now-Hear-Me-Out,Better Off Ted,5,31 July 2015,"To my friend and I, we believe that the laughs were bigger, longer and uncut, until the 20 or so minute mark, they become less frequent, just jokes in general stop happening, it's not exactly what you want for every comedy, but the court room scenes (c.r.s.) and scenes with the Donny character give the audience a moment of pause and reflection, only that moment isn't composed of enough or any laughter to fill time or to break the bleak mood of the audience, the audience itself should serve only to enhance the film, but damn when you get silence for a good 10 minutes it can feel like a job sitting there, looking, sifting through the crap you've already sat through, the Donny character could have (and should have) been revealed at the end when he unmasks himself at a con, the convention is where a sh!t load of physical comedy, punching, tripping, and the gripping of the 3 nippled lady proves to have been a time waster and a hell of a drawn out one, now I remember the first Ted and it having the same problem with wrapping up the plot in the last act, but in this there are still jokes occasionally popping up, which is appreciating, where in the first one fell flat, this new effort does make up for.Now where this film could MAJORLY improve would be in the c.r.s. It was the best scene in Airplane II because they filled the time with joke after joke after joke filed to the brim with genuine laugh out loud comedy, in here they slip in (or slap in, rather) maybe 5, 10 jokes, 1 of which comes out of nowhere and is off putting, it's to dry and muddled, I don't know why Seth MacFarlane could not come up with anymore in these two scenes, forget throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks, he doesn't even wind up to give it a chance. There's another film called Serial Mom (Waters) where in a c.r.s., the jokes keep coming at you like a freight train, it stays on track with the course and hits a few bumps along the way but keeps on a trucking.Overall I'd put this up there with This is the End, in that it'll be funny once, and you'll come back to it later remembering the great canyon of no jokes and failed attempts, but the ones that work, work, like Brooks' High Anxiety, it works as a one trick pony and beats out other show room horses that couldn't even reach the reins if they tried.",Ted 2
229,jpb007,"Good one-liners and gags, zero plot.",6,2 July 2015,"If there was a 6.5, I would give it. Because there was a lot to like in this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good one-liners, and good recurring gags.However, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot is lifted from ""Miracle on 43rd Street."" But it is not Christmas, Ted is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa, this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat. Markie Mark is same as ever, and I do enjoy him. Kudos to Amanda Seyfried, who tries so hard to make the romance story line work. But I could never get past the fact that I was watching MW and AS and a wise-cracking stuffed bear. Some good laughs? Yes. A good story? Not even close.",Ted 2
230,c-whitehead97,Meh,5,26 June 2015,"A few laughs throughout but nothing that had the whole cinema burst out laughing. Watching this film I felt as if they're were two sides to it. The first side being Ted's legal aspect. Very few laughs were present in this side of the film and in parts, it seemed more like a social commentary on current legal human rights. The second side of the film, was the off plot cheap laughs. These were funny but seemed completely irrelevant to the main story.Honestly, this movie isn't laugh out loud funny really, I can pretty much guarantee you'd laugh more when watching Jurassic World or Avengers 2 rather than watching this film.5/10 on a good day",Ted 2

Liking it does NOT make you a sophomoric member of a Happy Madison Audience. Disliking it does NOT make you a humorless slug. Hating it without giving it a fair chance and/or sticking around it for some reason DOES. This is NOT going to win movie of the year, but that's because Inside Out pretty much already has.The film delivers exactly what it promises. A swearing, stoner teddy bear who fights for his civil rights so he can have the custody of a child. If you've come for that and a good time with a 3/5 star, 7.0, 65% film made by Seth Macfarlane, you're in the right place. Better than A Million Ways?

Seth McFarlane should have taken more time over the script! Will not go to see 'Ted 3' if it is made? The film I badly made. The acting is dreadful! The scene where Walberg kisses Seyfried is not good! As a whole this film is a turkey. No good jokes and it is slow. No charm unlike 'Ted'. Should never have went! Please don't go! Waste of money.

If you've seen this movie you'll know what I mean. The concept of a teddy bear turn bad isn't something you'll see everyday and me being a fan of Family Guy was expecting a massive peter tumor in my brain however the tone in which Seth speaks is something of a Brian/Stewie/Peter mix. Slightly off his original voice. Okay, This is a small spoiler for my favorite Part: My favorite part which had me in stitches the first and second time I watched this was the first court seen that was amazing!Moving on my overview: The reason I rated it 9/10 was simply because of some of the CGI things I saw.

Ted and Johnny are amazing together but the lawyer does not fit in the group and sure is not funny at all. The screenplay gets too weak and the laughter becomes few giggles. I had huge expectations on this movie but I was disappointed. Please see the movie for yourself to understand what I am talking about. So much of potential has been wasted. I sincerely hope the third installment of this Franchise as confirmed happens to be all fun. Mr. K!,Ted 2

Especially this much in cinemas. I'm my own opinion, it's even better than the first. And I don't see many films that the sequel is much funnier. Definitely worth the watch for you people that like a laugh. Every actor did a good job in this film. Especially the main cast. I love he cameo by Liam Neeson. I laughed so much at his talent of acting in that small scene. I also would like to say that I love how well it is wrote.. The writers have done an amazing job. I love the concept of this film and main plot. If you haven't seen the first film, watch it before. It does matter, in my opinion. It is important. But I seriously recommend that you all give this a watch. I think I haven't laughed as much to a film before.",Ted 2
237,markdahl-72919,F. Seth MacFarlane,4,22 July 2017,"Loved Ted 1, expected Ted 2 to be OK but am sad to report its plain bad. Ted 1 did not have a strong plot, but it was consistently outrageous and laugh-out-loud funny. The gags in Ted 2 are not even loosely connected. The appearance of big name celebrities such as Jay Leno, Liam Neson, Morgan Freeman etc is mostly distracting. Not being American, I guess some references are lost on me. I found the Liam Neson cameo in Life's Too Short to be hilarious. Here, it's funny but forgettable. I'm glad to see Wallenberg and Kunis separated, but don't care for his new romance. The Giovanni Ribisi subplot was the low point of Ted 1. Why his character reappears in Ted 2 is beyond me (and how did Ribisi track the trio from Boston to NY?). The finale at comic con sucks. The nerd bashing by Patrick Warburton (who is otherwise good) is not entertaining. There are still a number of laughs. My favourite scenes were at the sperm bank and Ted driving. Memorable, funny, deeply uncomfortable. Watch them on YouTube, but skip the full length feature.",Ted 2

TED 2 on the other hand takes itself much too seriously in trying to deal with the humanity of Ted. Seriously, what can a potheads and fart jokes movie tell us about being human? Lots of recycled jokes from Ted 1 and Ted as the main comic attraction in the movie just doesn't work anymore. There are a few good jokes and visual gags as befitting a summer comedy, but the rest are only marginally funny with a boring movie plot that connects them. You can see it if you happen to be home and stoned with nothing better to do :)",Ted 2

I went into the movies with a negative expectation just due to previous franchised movie history. The jokes were just spot on, original, one after another. The entire theater was laughing and of their seats. I loved the first Ted and now I also love Ted 2 just as much. I would even watch it again if another friend wants to go watch it. Seth is such a talented comedian and to me he's work and sense of humor is amazing. I highly recommend watching this and promise that you wont be disappointed watching this movie.

It's a good combination between comedy and action. Some action happening in the end, but comedy lurking around every corner! Mark Wahlburg and Seth MacFarlane have such a good fusion.

Also, Seth (Ted) talked about new generations. New generations don't know differences between Star Wars and Star Trek, who is Rocky, etc. There is no Mila Kunis. She is sacked in first line of movie.

There was some jokes which hit my taste & were too disgusting - but overall whole movie was hilarious. Ted 2 - unfortunately has got the opposite proportion of these, being mostly disgusting with awkward jokes making me ill at ease. Scenes like a trying to w*nk out a person to get his sp*rm (Ted tries to have a baby) or John being weighed down by a cabinet full of sem*n containers (in a sp*rm bank)... and covered with... it...

It surely paid the tributes to those 40's and 50's Hollywood movies with group dances by dressed gentlemen and ladies doing amazing foot work. It went so smooth with Ted being the lead dancer. It was quite an unexpected and fresh move in the movie. Also, I appreciate it referred to or made humor out of the current and as well as old pop culture. Though audiences who are not familiar with American pop culture, especially those old pop cultures and classics movies, might miss out most of the humor in the movie. The movie connects well with us grown-ups. Teddy bear is generally children's favorite, and this Teddy bear is even cooler, because it does grow up, and even fools around with his best friend! It is definitely an entertaining movie, and a movie about love and friendship.",Ted 2
246,pepe-fazi-982-762104,The best laughs I've had in a while.,8,28 June 2015,"When I sat in to see this movie, I had little expectations for it, due to the rising number of bad sequels to good movies. However, I was greeted with a happy surprise only 5 minutes in the movie, as it turned out to be a hilariously set, totally immature little story for the crowd.Due to the fact, that the humor in this movie is mostly immature and ""childish"" as most would call it, some people will not like it as much as those who appreciate the art of making a immature humor actually enjoyable. However, I suspect the majority of viewers will be more than satisfied with the quality of the humor, no matter the style.The story follows a legal issue Ted and Johnny encounter, and their adventure of getting through it. The acting was perfect from Mark Wahlberg and Amanda Seyfried, as they allowed their characters to be as realistic as real gets in a world where magic teddy bears exist. Seth MacFarlane's voice acting is also great, he expressed Ted's emotions through just voicing him flawlessly. Ted's CGI was also great, considering he is a plush teddy bear. Most other actors in the movie also did a great job, only Jessica Barth seemed like she could have done better. Never the less, I think the movie was acted out perfectly.Seth MacFarlane's direction was well suited for a movie such as this. The camera angles 90% of the time were great, the lighting and choreography of the actors/actresses were well done.Overall I'd rate this movie an 8/10, it is definitely a movie you will love, if you appreciate such humor. Word of advice, though, don't take your kids to this movie, as it does contain strong language. I'm only giving the movie an 8 out of 10, because there were some parts where unnecessary content was placed that contributed neither to the story nor the theme, but aside from those 2-3 scenes, the movie in itself was perfect. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for a good laugh for an hour and a half.",Ted 2

I liked the first part, it was entertaining and funny, but Ted 2... only teddy bear is cute, but really, jokes are cliché, lots of illogical scenes (yes, live teddy bear isn't logical as well, but you get my point). I hate the 'too fake' musical scenes, where a person plays the guitar, sings and you can hear the goddamn drums, which are not in the middle of nowhere... I keep asking myself why they even made the second part of this movie, because it has nothing to show, just using the name. But in my opinion it was enough of Ted 1. I really hope that they won't make the third or fourth part.I won't recommend to watch it, unless you need a background movie or something. I didn't find this movie so funny.",Ted 2

Although I really like Mark Wahlberg and think he is the best thing about this film, I really disliked it overall (like you couldn't tell). I laughed three times: Liam Neeson, apples on the roof, and the first black cock. Apart from that, in my opinion this movie tries to lower the level of the lowest common denominator. Yes, it is true that I also dislike ""Family Guy"" and, had I realized who is behind ""Ted 2,"" I would not have seen it at all.

I am going to see it again. The jokes were disgusting but that is the point. If you liked the first one you will love this one. If you didn't you will still find yourself laughing despite yourself.When you find out the reason they cannot have kids it is funny to find out why a sperm donor won't work. When they see Ton Brady's equipment it is priceless. The twist at the end will have you wondering what the heck is going on but is funny as anything as well. The comicon seen with Patrick Warburton dressed up as The Tick (whom he did the voice for) was just spot on. The movie references sped at you one after another.

Please do not watch this movie if you take life seriously , please don't waste your precious time if you value life to watch this movie. when I got my refund I wanted more compensation, I wanted Gas money and an hour back of my time. The writing sucked, the acting was even worse I know my 10yr old nephews would've had a blast but I'm simply a bit smarter than a 5th grader to take this movie seriously.

252,jamiebriggs,Was really funny but storyline was still poor,8,30 June 2015,When I found out there was going to be a Ted 2 I was really excited for it as the first one was really funny. I found Ted 2 to be really funny. The jokes were improved from the first movie.I still find that The storyline (the plot) was still very weak and needs to improve if they do another movie. I found that this movie was really funny at the start then in the middle it was a bit slow and they put scenes in when it wasn't necessary and the ending was funny again.Apart from that it was really funny with good actors/actresses with improved dialogue. I give it a 8/10 as the storyline was still a bit poor.Also this movie has the same humour as family guy so if you like the show you will love Ted 2 but if you don't like Family guy don't see it your wasting your money. I wouldn't recommend to take kids to see it either because of the language they use in the film.,Ted 2

Why I liked Ted 2 better than Hot Tub Time Machine 2, well the Hot Tub sequel could not make any of the gags work, they threw anything out there and it really shows, and nobody was interesting and likable. But in Ted 2 was the total opposite, you really like the characters despite the stupid things they do, leave it to Seth Macfarlane, who can make you be charmed by foul humor and gross out gags.Ted(voiced by Seth Macfarlane) wants to have a baby with his wife, but then he is questioned by the law, he is human or property? Mark Wahlberg and Seth Macfarlane where funny, and have a great comic chemistry. So does Amanda Seyfried has there lawyer, I mean you see that they where having the best time making this. At times it feels like you are watching a Family Guy episode at times cause of all the homages to other classics. All the other supporting cast do well also.

254,danielc-66884,Ted 2 review,6,13 July 2015,"When describing Ted 2, I can compare it to eating a second piece of a chocolate cake. Although it still tastes delicious, it's not the same as the first bite. Seth McFarlane had a difficult challenge on his hands when writing a script for the sequel. Fortunately for him, I am glad to say that Ted 2 still has those offensive, witty and utterly humorous jokes and gags that still work as effectively as the first film. So from the writing side of the table, it seems that Seth has once again justified his comical talent. However, despite the film trying desperately hard to build a storyline surrounding Ted and his battle to become a human being in a court of law, not only do you not buy it but you also don't really care. The concept of the first film was rather simple; it focused on the lifelong friendship of a man and his magical teddy bear. That was it. I feel like the second time around, Seth felt somewhat obliged to shove a disjointed storyline down our throats and with the gang going from court to on a road trip to comic con, it all gets a bit erratic and nonsensical. Amanda seyfriend joins the cast as a blonde weed smoking lawyer who aids John & Ted in their search to prove Ted is that of a human being. She's actually one of the more quirky characters to the film and is a solid replacement for Mila Kunis. There a few cameos here and there; some hilarious, some unnecessary. Overall, fans of the first film will still enjoy the on screen chemistry of Mark whalberg & Ted but I think we all have to agree that this second outing lacks the freshness, the heart & the charm of the first film. An avid attempt at best with some redeeming qualities. Daniel Cullinane",Ted 2

Agreed family guy has definitely run its course (a few years ago if you ask me).. But American Dad in my opinion is the most genius and witty show.. I have literally watched every single episode. As for Ted and Ted 2, I just got back from seeing Ted 2 and there was at least five times I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard.. Granted some jokes go a little far but that duo of Wahlberg/Ted is just too good.. I also went into this thinking it would be another crap sequel but walked out pleasantly surprised.

We won't feel boringness for a single moment. In my eyes, it's the Most entertaining movie of 2015. All the characters did their level best. But personally I wanna mention Jecissa's name.I think she's the best of all. Her body language, dialog throwing style, her overall look is most appealing. Morgan & Liam, the two experienced guy did nice in short roles. There is no need to say about Mark though. He's my sweet macho buddy. And Teddy? Oh no way.

The lines are so cheesy, the story is so childish and it seems they wrote the scenario in a week. If you are looking for some real comedy then you are in a wrong place. You will never get back this 120 minutes of your life back. Such a shame for Morgan Freeman's name to put on this film. The jokes are so not funny and they wanna make fun out of F words all the time.

I laughed more frequently watching this movie than I did while watching the first though.Now, if you don't like dirty jokes and are offended by harsh words this movie might not be anything for you. Personally I think that the movie is only better with the swear words and such.Overall it's a great movie to both watch by yourself or with company.

259,jmckinney-56885,Good Movie. I'm unsure of what people expected that gave it bad ratings,6,18 June 2016,"Now, this movie was much better than the first because this movie has a deeper plot with just as many laughs. Only thing I disliked about the film is that it doesn't carry the intensity from beginning to end. In the beginning, it's much funnier and it sets itself up to be much more intense than the previous Ted. About midway, much of it's intensity is lost due to,""Why would you-"" type moments. For instance, in Movie one, ted was ripped in half and it was made obvious that he's composed of regular teddy bear stuffing. In this second movie, the same guy that kidnapped him and witnessed him die, composes a plan with the CEO of a toy company. The plan revolved around kidnapping Ted and then dissecting him to see what makes him real when in actuality, we already know it was just a magical wish and Ted is still composed of regular stuffing, nothing special. Ted even states it himself as he's about to get dissected. Also, before the plan was in affect, Mark Wahlberg loses ted in a crowd. For reasons I can't understand, they let Ted walk off, by himself, and then decided to look for him 10 minutes later. Lastly, the Romance this movie tries to capture is a bit shaky. It's nearly obvious that Amanda is perfect for Mark within the first minutes of her appearance but there love connection develops painstakingly slow. It would've been much more enjoyable to watch them come together earlier in the movie, work through some adversity, and get Ted his rights.",Ted 2
260,cristonvandalar,This Movie is Super funny :D,10,18 November 2015,"This movie is really really Funny i have to admit it was supper entertaining though it got no moral or some cleaver plot or something but for me i guess it was made to entertain people and also i was laughing my ass off while i was watching it in the cinema and also the people who were watching it with me was like super duper hyped and i have to say the most awesome parts was the part when Ted have sex with his girlfriend at work yeah that was so funny and he got promoted to higher rank i was like what the freak man and also the part when Samantha, Johnny, Ted smoke weed in the office and also the part when Ted drive the car the funniest one was when Morgan Freeman says""Justin Bieber"". I guess Mr.Freeman does indeed hate Justin Bieber.",Ted 2
261,ddominhquan,the movie talk about a teddy which is addicted to weed,9,29 November 2015,"The story starts with Ted getting married to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). (""You may kiss the bear!"") The couple live in a tenement and bicker all the time. As they throw crockery at each other and yell obscenities at their neighbours, the film seems to be turning into a spoof of blue-collar movies about failing relationships. Ted and Tami-Lynn have dead-end jobs at the supermarket. To get away from the feuding, the teddy bear spends as much time as he can drinking and taking drugs with his best buddy John (Mark Wahlberg), who is now a porn addict living on his own.Ted and Tami-Lynn decide that the only way they can save their relationship is by having a baby, which requires a sperm donor – and results in a lot of very smutty slapstick. Ted's more serious problem is that the government does not recognise him as a ""person"", which means that he has no rights. Worse, a creepy toilet attendant, Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), is hatching a plan to kidnap him.The writing here is often witty. As Ted's devoted friend, Wahlberg underplays beautifully and there is an engaging performance, too, from Amanda Seyfried as the pothead young lawyer who takes on Ted's case.What is far less attractive is the way the film seems to sneer at the butts of many of its jokes, whether they're nerdish comic-book fans, nurses, joggers, or the stand-up comedians whose improv routines Ted and his friends take such pleasure in sabotaging.",Ted 2
262,khoadangphamxxx-08664,the movie talks about a teddy bear which is crazy,10,29 November 2015,"The magical teddy bear with the heart of gold and the mouth of potty is back in ""Ted 2,"" and so is writer-director-star Seth MacFarlane's mischievous mojo, which went missing somewhere in last year's mirthless comic Western ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" A sequel to MacFarlane's surprise 2012 smash ($549 million worldwide), ""Ted 2"" is surely the last movie one would expect to find quoting from the anthropologist Dawn Prince-Hughes' writings on the essence of human consciousness. But in its own, sweetly subversive way, this might be just the tolerance plea America needs right now — a movie that says, in effect, ""Love thy plushie as thyself."" Fret not: Such high- mindedness has little diminished MacFarlane's appetite for locker-room humor, gross-out sight gags and bounteous pop-culture in-jokes, which should make ""Ted 2"" the season's go-to attraction for arrested- adolescent males of all ages, and continue Universal's beary good summer box office.",Ted 2
263,lenegausland,Waste of time,1,26 March 2018,Too much dick and pot jokes. Not even funny. Dick this and dick that. Seth MacFarlane need to come out of the closet already. Enough said.,Ted 2
