0,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but missing something",6,11 January 2017,"TRIPLE 9 is another thriller from Australian director John Hillcoat, who previously made the excellent THE PROPOSITION and the watchable LAWLESS. This one's a contemporary crime flick about a gang of robbers who steal stuff for the Russian mafia, and it's one of those twisty-turny type stories with a lot of complexity to make it watchable too. Unfortunately it's not quite the masterpiece that the director or the trailer would have you believe.The film starts off on a strong footing with an excellently-staged heist scene; this is the best part of the film and sees Hillcoat at the top of his game. Norman Reedus is a welcome addition to the cast and steals all of his scenes early on. Unfortunately, the film then slips into low gear and doesn't really come back until the ending. A second robbery is agreed on early enough, but it takes an hour for this robbery to go into motion, and there's a lot of extraneous stuff where not much happens.The script really struggles to craft likable characters and Casey Affleck is about the only one here that the viewer even halfway likes. Anthony Mackie and Chiwetel Ejiofor have very little to work with and are quite repellent in their parts. Woody Harrelson goes too far with the tics and mannerisms and feels like a walking caricature, while Kate Winslet is simply miscast as the supposedly imposing villain of the piece. Aaron Paul is pretty good although has too little screen time, while Michael Kenneth Williams has a delightful cameo.",Triple 9

A group of criminals and corrupt cops are working for her with some duress. Brothers Gabe (Aaron Paul) and Russell Welch (Norman Reedus), and Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are the criminals. Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins, Jr.) are the cops. Marcus has new partner Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) who he wants to manufacture a police down Triple 9 scenario. Chris' uncle Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) is investigating the crew.The movie is chaotic. The story is messy. It is overflowing with characters which only keeps the movie in confusion. There are great actors involved but it would be nice to give them space and time to work. There are some good action although sometimes it could be grittier and tougher. It tries for hard action and it succeed in some parts. The movie would work so much better with fewer leads and a tighter script.",Triple 9
2,nogodnomasters,Be careful what you instagoogletweetface,6,28 November 2017,"A group of former special ops lead by a crooked cop work for the ""Russian Kosher-nostra"" the Russian Jewish mafia in Atlanta. After pulling one heist, they are tasked with a second one where they would need a lot of time. They opt to create a diversion by killing a cop, creating a 999 call. This would give them the time.While we get that plan early, it isn't executed until late in the film. What the bad guys are up against is a salty Woody Harrelson detective with paid informants and quite the wordsmith. Outside of the Harrelson character, the film was a run of the mill crime drama/thriller.Guide: F-words. No sex or nudity.",Triple 9
3,kosmasp,Going to Town,6,22 September 2016,"So this has a lot of promise, most of it coming from the assembled cast. I mean even Kate Winslet signed onto it for Pete's sake. So the acting talent is there, the beginning is very strong (with a chance to have a twist for you, especially if you haven't seen the trailer before watching the movie), but it gets a bit muddled after that.There is no real explanation for certain things or why the characters got tangled. Which is not always a bad thing, especially because the viewer can puzzle it together (it's not that hard to make sense of it). But it gets to be bad, especially because the movie even with 2 hours running time, has a lot of characters and stories to go through. There is almost no chance for the audience to actually feel for all of them or be able to digest what they're going through (no matter how good they are portrayed). Action wise it does get its point across, which is a big positive, story wise unfortunately it's lacking. The ending will either be the nail in the coffin or another neat surprise, depending on your views of things",Triple 9
4,classicsoncall,"""Be careful what you instagoogletweetface!""",6,3 April 2021,"After watching a couple hundred cop and gangster movies, this was the first time I ever heard of reference to a 'triple 9', or in police talk, 'officer down, needs help immediately'. It takes some time into this story in which some dirty cops in league with ex-military personnel, concoct a scheme to take down a police officer as a distraction in order to pull off a heist for the Russian mob. All the while I'm thinking why couldn't the Russian mob pull off these jobs by themselves instead of going through intermediaries, but what do I know? This had the potential to be a gritty crime thriller, and it was up to a point, but in the latter stages it seemed to hit a wall of confusion where it was difficult to figure out what the good guys and bad guys were up to because of the double crosses involved. Even with an extraordinarily stellar cast, none of the principals come across as likeable characters, even Woody Harrelson and Casey Affleck as the cops seeking to take down the crime ring run by Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor). And try as I might, I couldn't relate to Kate Winslet and Wonder Woman Gal Gadot as a pair of Russian sisters heading up a crime syndicate. By the time it's ready to wrap things up, even the bad guys are offing each other, and you might question whether things end up in any positive sort of way. But if you ever wondered how those exploding red dye packs worked in a bank robbery situation, check out the early going and you'll get more than you bargained for.",Triple 9
5,LeonLouisRicci,"Unmemorable, Ugly Looking, Star-Studded Mediocrity",6,4 August 2016,"What one remembers in this Unmemorable Film is the Color Red and the Darkness. There's Red Dye, Red Shoes, Red Dress, Red Lights, and of course, Red Blood. Scenes are mostly in Dark Rooms, Dark Tunnels, Dark Vans, Dark Alleyways, and of course, Dark Characters.Every Cast Member is a ""Name"" of sorts, but not a one Brings Anything Remarkable to the Story. Casey Affleck, some Professional Critics actually Single Out His Gig as something Special. Must have been the constant Chewing Gum that caused Him to Mumble even more than usual.The Action Sequences are OK and some have a Gimmick or Two to Heighten the Display of Standard Gun Action. The Story is Simple but surprisingly Incoherent at times. Nothing much comes together in this Average at Best Cop/Criminal Heist Movie. The Russian Mob is on hand to be Typically Sadistic, Brutal, and Barely Human, strike that, Inhuman. Overall, Worth a Watch for Fans of the Genre but don't expect anything Special. It's Downbeat and Gloomy with nary a Smile, but Plenty of Painful Scowls, more than a Few Coming from the Audience.",Triple 9

Uneven at best warmed over Michael Mann HEAT wannabe - to wit: a gaggle of corrupt LA cops plan several heists in league with a Russian mafia king pin (Winslet, slumming and decidedly miscast) finds things going off the rails when a good cop (wan Affleck) enters the picture to gum up the works. While there are a few kinetic chase and action sequences arranged with skill and flair by director John Hillcoat the screenplay by Matt Cook is pedestrian at best and the blue chip cast (except for Mackie, the poor man's Will Smith - not a compliment either) wasted except for Harrelson begin a hoot as an alcoholic detective and uncle to Affleck to spice things up nicely.",Triple 9
7,neil-476,Great performances don't make a great film,6,26 February 2016,"A crew comprising bent cops and crooks are forced into carrying out a complex heist for Russian gangsters in order to get paid.My synopsis is skeletal: it was either that, or go into great detail about a plot which is superficially complex by virtue of the number of different groups and subgroups involved, with crossover between them. This apparent complexity hides a relatively straightforward story which, itself, is cluttered up with texture and detail which obscures the main plot line (there is an extended sequence involving the graphic aftermath of a gangland slaying, the purpose of which is to illustrate relationships between certain of the characters and introduce a couple of minor characters who have important actions later, but this scene is given such detailed attention that one is misled into believing that it has greater plot relevance than is actually the case).A good and powerful cast work hard to bring life to a thriller which, I think, has rather less to it than meets the eye. Kate Winslet impresses by looking and sounding nothing like Kate Winslet, and pretty nearly everyone in this gives a good performance.But I was left puzzled at the end because I never felt the film had a sense of purpose to it – the events happened and each character suffered a particular fate and then it ended. Yes, I know you can say that about most films, but the stakes in this were so high that I was expecting a resolution to the film which meant more.",Triple 9
8,FlashCallahan,Not the movie adaptation of the Michael Buerk BBC show....,5,26 May 2016,"What could be one of the finest ensemble casts of the year, turns a mundane script, in to a mundane, seen it all before heist thriller.a crew of corrupt cops and career criminals, are blackmailed by the Russian Mob to rob a bank in broad daylight. The leader of the crew is an ex-special forces operator turned private sector. Unsatisfied with the job, the head of the mob, kidnaps his family and forces him to rob a Special Forces safe house that contains secret government files. The crew must figure out a way to manufacture a 999, police code for officer down, to use during their heist. When of the corrupt cops gets a new rookie partner, the crew decides that he is the perfect target. But the rookie survives the attack, and suspects the dirty cops. Meanwhile the police chief begins to track down the Russian Mob, and starts finding evidence of corruption among the cops. The pressure starts mounting and the crew begins to turn on each other and reveal dark secrets.....The opening robbery has its moments, but it doesn't stimulate you in the way it should do. Opening set pieces are there to eat the tone of the film, to let you know that things are going to be a lot more dangerous and riskier than this one.For a good example, see the opening of Heat, for a poor example, stick with this. Because this is the poor mans Heat, with extra special guest stars.But the biggest problem is, there is literally not one character to root for. The corrupt cops are vile, the criminals try to be good in the sense that they don't trust the cops, but are also horrid, and the good guys are either very loud drunks, or moody brothers of the new Batman who couldn't care about anything other than his own backside.And then there is Kate Winslet, in a baffling turn as a Mob boss with the most hilarious accent she has delivered on screen.By the third act,you couldn't care less who lives, dies, gets written out of the film in another way, because it's just bland and. Mundane for its own good.Kudos though to Clifton Collins Jr. though, he's been playing the same role now for heaven knows how long, and he doesn't change here.It's all a bit meh.",Triple 9

It all starts rather easy with a heist at a bank but once they have to do another job things go wrong.From there on it's corruption galore. With the excellent cast it do delivers a superb bloody flick. And yes, some main actors do die quickly in this flick and even as Aaron Paul (Gabe) is doing what he's best in, a drug-fiend it is well done. Top cast in a top flick.

10,deloudelouvain,A waste of talent for a bad story,5,21 January 2017,You would think that a movie with such a cast could only be good. But in Triple 9 talented actors are the proof it's not a guarantee you will have a good movie all the time. It starts good though with the bank robbery but afterwards the story is kinda boring and way too long. Plus the story should have had more explanations but even with that I don't know if it would have helped making it more interesting. There is plenty of action though but most of the time I was just bored with the movie. When I saw the cast I had high hopes but at the end it's just not good enough. Now there are worse movies then Triple 9 but if I was you I wouldn't waste my time on this one and just look for something better. Disappointing movie night.,Triple 9
11,KineticSeoul,"Despite the casts, this is a very forgettable movie.",5,30 April 2016,"I can't say this is a bad movie, it's actually quite watchable. But the flaw is that it's not a very enticing movie. The trailer is way more enticing and entertaining than the actual movie itself. I could tell they tried to go in a gritty and impactful movie, but compared to other street or cop dramas out there this one just doesn't stand out at all. Even TV shows have a more in-depth and disturbing parts compared to this movie. This movie has a great cast, especially for a street/cop thriller such as this. But it lacked the impact, momentum and gut churning moments that build tension to make it stand out. This is actually quite a forgettable movie. Most of the cast just seemed to have been wasted in this. None of them have any moments that actually makes them shine or stand out, because there is no memorable scenes. Maybe because I got a bit desensitized because I have seen a lot of thrillers that are better than this one. This is a movie that deals with crooked cops try to deal with idealistic cops with 2 heists thrown in. Overall, despite the good cast it's a very lacking thriller.5.9/10",Triple 9
12,Hellmant,The right audience should get a big kick out of it!,9,9 March 2016,"'TRIPLE 9': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Gritty crime thriller; about a gang of criminals (including two corrupt cops) that are forced into performing two dangerous heists, for a Russian mob boss's wife. It was directed by John Hillcoat (who also directed the outstanding 'LAWLESS' and 'THE ROAD'), and it was scripted by first time feature film writer Matt Cook. The all- star cast includes Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Clifton Collins, Jr., Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer and Cal Gadot. I enjoyed it immensely. The story takes place in Atlanta, Georgia; where Michael Atwood (Ejiofor) leads a team of criminals in a daring bank robbery. They're objective is to retrieve a safe deposit box; which contains information vital to freeing a convicted Russian Mafia boss. Michael takes the box to Irina Vlaslov (Winslet), the mob boss's wife, but she insists they perform another job for her. She next wants the gang to steal more important data (on her husband), from a secured government building. Irina kills one gang member, and threatens to take Michael's son; in order to get the criminals to cooperate. The group devises a plan to kill a cop (a Triple 9 police call), as a diversion. Gang member Marcus Belmont (Mackie), a corrupt cop, suggests they kill his new partner, Chris Allen (Affleck).The movie is very dark, gritty and graphically violent; it also contains explicit sex, nudity, disturbing drug use and lots of foul language. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, but the right audience should get a big kick out of it. Some of it seems pretty intense and hard to watch; but it also feels like a movie (like a really good crime action flick). The pacing is great, the performances are all good and the dialogue is witty. The film definitely has it's flaws too though. It's an especially odd mix of genre pleasing action formula, and realistic crime thriller; but I really enjoyed it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY",Triple 9

14,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Sadly undelivering cop thriller,4,26 September 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A team of corrupt cops are involved in criminal activities at the behest of the Russian mob, headed by gangster's wife Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet.) But the latest will involve the murder of a fellow police officer in order for the 'Triple 9' code to be activated among the cops, but everything goes disastrously wrong.Michael Mann's Heat set a standard in crime capers that many have tried to better, or at least emulate. This glossy production would be one such example of this, getting the dark, moody, lingering atmosphere right down to a tee. With a flashy, all star cast to boot, all the right ingredients are in place for something truly tasty, but sadly, Triple 9 is ultimately an unsatisfying affair.For all its aesthetic aplomb, its somehow uninvolving, and you fail to either get swept up in the story, or feel any depth in any of the characters. As a result, there's a distinct lack of tension to anything, even with everything going on, and John Hillcoat has laced his script without the slightest trace of humour to soften the blow at any time. It's just a relentlessly dark, bleary slog right to the end.All involved have sadly prostituted their talents to something very bland and mediocre, and you're just left wondering why. **",Triple 9
15,bowmanblue,Should have been better,6,27 February 2017,"Sometimes, you see a film advertised and you think 'How can this possibly fail?' Then, upon sitting through it, you wonder how the film-makers managed to make something that looked so awesome come across as so mediocre. And that's what 'Triple 9' is – mediocre. It's not bad. I didn't hate it. I just thought that, judging by the acting talent on display, that it should have been so much more special than what it actually was.It's about a squad of 'dirty' cops who, along with upholding the bits of the law that suit them, also help criminals rob banks. But, somewhere along the way they seemed to forget that criminals – being criminals – can't always be trusted to uphold their side of a bargain. Naturally, the gang they're working for want a little more than was originally offered and conflict arises.The reason Triple 9 looked so good was the cast of characters – anything with Norman Reedus (or 'Daryl' from The Walking Dead) and Aaron Paul (or 'Jessie' from Breaking Bad) can't be all bad, can it? Well, like I say, it's not all bad, it's just pretty forgettable. Apart from one scene that occurred around the middle of the film where the cops storm a drugs den – that's pretty intense and comes across as well researched as to how real police would undertake such an operation. However, it's been about a week since I watched Triple 9 and, apart from that and the meaning of the phrase 'Triple 9' itself, there really isn't that much I can remember about it. Or rather than the actors I really wanted to see in the film aren't in it as much as I'd hoped and, where they were, they were criminally underused.I know I'm being harsh. But it's just if you've seen as many 'cops and robbers' movies as I have over the years then you really need something very different to set one apart. And this one just didn't have what I was looking for. Yes, it's stylish and well-directed, plus you have the acting talent on offer and, if you're looking for realism then you'll find a fair amount of violence here. However, in the course of film history, I'm guessing that this will just be written off as yet another cops and robbers movie. Pity.",Triple 9
16,ThomasDrufke,Who Do We Root For?,7,27 February 2016,"This is one of those films that has specific moments that could be considered great, but the sum of its parts is a little messy, convoluted, and a bit of a disappointed. John Hillcoat's direction is unsurprisingly effective when it needs to be, including a few incredibly intense action sequences. He also brought a great amount of realism to a film that could have felt over-the-top. Triple 9 is by no means a great film, but it's hard to deny that enjoyment I had watching this film.With probably the biggest ensemble cast of the year so far, it doesn't suffer from any acting problems. Anthony Mackie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot and a few others round out the accomplished cast. As great as some of their performances are, particularly, Casey Affleck and Anthony Mackie, I feel like most of them have played a similar role in the past (in a better movie). Affleck played a similar cop/detective character in Gone Baby Gone. Norman Reedus essentially plays Daryl Dixon. Harrelson plays his True Detective character with a slight spin, and I swear Aaron Paul was playing Jesse Pinkman. That's not to say they all don't do their jobs in the film, but at times I found myself wishing I was watching some of these actors other films instead.The film takes a little while to get going too. The opening heist scene is cool, including an intense highway sequence, but there's so many moving pieces that it can be hard to keep track of who is who and who is on whose side at first. The greatest strength of the film is its realism, however. The entire plot feels like it's being played out in present day Atlanta and the heists, deaths, and characters don't feel hyper-real. The characters are written well enough that at times you don't know who to root for and who to trust.Even the unrecognizable Kate Winslet, never takes her character further than the story asks her to. When there are surprising shifts with characters, they felt necessary within the constructs of their personality. I think the film could of definitely spotlighted focus on a few characters instead of making it more of an ensemble, so that the film's overall quality could have potentially improved. But at the same time, I loved all of the performances. This is a hard film to pinpoint its quality. The characters are in fact more interesting than any of the heists themselves, and I think that's a tribute to Hillcoat's direction and the screenplay, but it can also be uneven and convoluted at times. Overall, I think people can have a good time with Triple 9.+Affleck's standout performance+Ensemble cast is very good as well+Meticulously crafted intense action sequences+Realistic feel-Most of the actors have played similar roles (in better films/TV)-Ensemble proves to be overwhelming at times7.4/10",Triple 9
17,cosmo_tiger,Even having watched it twice before writing this I have a hard time finding something good to say about it. Very disappointing.,5,18 April 2016,"""We pray at the same alter."" In this town cops and criminals are the same people. When a gang is caught and blackmailed by the Russian mob they only have one option other then death. They are to break into a special forces safe house and steal classified government files. Without any real choice the crew realizes that the only way to pull this off is to set up a 999 call. When criminals, good cops, and bad cops all become involved something is bound to go wrong. I was actually looking forward to watching this. The cast is incredible, the idea sounded very interesting and I was hoping for a movie along the lines of Smoking Aces, but a little more serious. I wondered why it came and went in the theaters so fast but I was still excited. I watch and review every movie I order for the store and because of that 99% of the time I review my first impression of the movie. I did something I never do with this one. I watched it twice because I figured it couldn't have been as bad as my first impression was. After the second viewing I came to the conclusion that this was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. I'm not sure how a movie with an idea this interesting and a cast this great can drop the ball so badly but they did. They movie was flat and uninteresting, hard to follow at times and just overall nothing I was hoping for.

18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,15 May 2016,"Triple 9The worst thing about working for a Russian boss is their zero-tolerance policy towards bathroom breaks.But as the thieves in this thriller have learned, working alongside them is even worse.The wife of a convicted Russian crime boss (Kate Winslet) hires a coalition of career criminals (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul) and crooked cops (Anthony Mackie, Clifton Collins, Jr.) to obtain a safe-deposit box from a bank for her.But before she hands over payment, she now wants them to infiltrate a government building to steal more evidence to help overturn her husband's sentence.Meanwhile, two straight cops (Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson) work the case from different angels.Action-packed with some intriguing relationships and colorful characters, Triple 9 defies its numerous crime story clichés to formulate a forceful but ultimately forgettable heist picture.Furthermore, cops and robs only work well together when it comes to fixing their marriage.

19,Reno-Rangan,Combination of wrong path and untrustworthy troop.,6,24 June 2016,"This should have been the Hollywood's bad boys film. I mean the big cast names are expected like the earlier films of QT, or especially like 'The Departed'. There were many who dropped out of it for various reasons prior to the production commence, although this cast did a great job. In my finding I blame for the screenplay. It was a good story, but the first half was not very interesting compared to the next half, which was so brilliant, especially towards the end, mind blowing.It was a multi starrer film, only that's much I know, but I kind lazy to count how many were there because I thought it was a modernised and an improvised cop version of the 'Ten Little Indians' theme. There's no evidence to prove that, it is just my theory. But seeing all the deaths and the conclusion, I felt the inspiration to the writer might have been possible.From the director of 'Lawless' who aimed for another success, but received backfire from critically and commercially. Mixed response from the audience though. Definitely it will find its own fans in the days and years to come. The ladies had scopeless roles, so they're completely forgettable their existence the narration, except very often just appear to show the faces. But well made crucial parts, in all the action sequences which kind what back the films along with Casey and Harrelson's parts.Like there is a saying, 'slow start, but ended strong', this film belongs to the same category. If you hold your patience for nearly 2 hours long, in the end you might feel after all it was not a bad flick. So not recommended to everybody, at a same time not suggested to skip it without properly knowing about it. P.S, the closing credit song, the remix version of 'Pigs' by Cypress Hill was awesome considering the theme of the film, I mean the corrupted cops, but felt the words were strong.6/10",Triple 9
20,tomgillespie2002,Clichéd crime drama that gets a pass thanks to Hillcoat's signature brutality,5,17 June 2016,"Boasting an enormously talented ensemble cast and a multi-layered story of corruption and greed set in the murky criminal world of the Russian mafia in Atlanta, John Hillcoat's Triple 9 has the ambition of Michael Mann's Heat (1995) but neither the scope or the running- time to convincingly pull it off. Telling the tale of a gang of hardened criminals and bent coppers coming together to pull of a heist, and then another, to save the skin of a brutal Russian mafia boss, it is hardly the most original entry into the crime genre, but manages to sneak a pass thanks to some splendid visuals and Hillcoat's signature brutality that gives the film a unique, raw edge.Two cops - Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) - and three criminals - gang leader Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and brothers Russell (Norman Reedus) and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul) - come together to rob a bank in order to retrieve a security deposit box containing evidence against the husband of mafia boss Irina (Kate Winslet). After a narrow escape, they are refused payment and are ordered to pull off another job to again retrieve data on Irina's husband. The job is near-impossible, so the gang come up with an idea of triggering a 'triple 9' call, which involves all police responding to an 'officer down' and heading to the location of the incident, therefore diverting all attention away from them. Marcus's new partner Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), a bullheaded new recruit quickly making enemies with the Mexican gangs, is chosen as the ideal candidate.There's an undeniable star power to Triple 9, and the film struggles to allow them all the chance to shine. Because of the lack of running time required to properly develop the many characters, they are either painted with incredibly broad strokes or so thinly that they are relegated to merely 'tough good guy' or 'tough bad guy'. Weaving in and out of the main set the central story is crack- snorting Detective Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), the hard-nosed yet likable sergeant investigating the gang, who also happens to be Chris' uncle. Just in case his questionable drug habit isn't enough, the camera insists on showing us every bead of sweat running down his unwashed brow to reinforce the idea that this really is a tough guy who doesn't play by the rules. Triple 9 is sadly chocked full of tired genre clichés, right down to the tacky dress-sense of Winslet's Russian gangster, all big hair and garish outfits.Despite the immense talent of its actors, lazy writing and too much time spent watching these characters flexing their muscles at each other means that none really make an impression. Ejiofor certainly tries, but he fails to make us sympathise with his character, who is supposed to be the conflicted emotional core of the film, and Paul repeats his Jesse Pinkman shtick without the benefit of 5 seasons worth of character development. Things lighten up when a few heated exchanges simmer with tension, as Hillcoat makes it clear from the outset that no character is safe. With his best films, The Proposition (2005) and The Road (2009), Hillcoat demonstrated a real talent forging an extremely dark mood, brimming with atmosphere and lurking threat, but here, he manages it only fleetingly, finding little time to do so amidst an overstuffed plot.",Triple 9
21,Floated2,Decent but could have been much better,6,19 December 2016,"Triple 9 is a heist film which was released early in the year. The film flopped at the box office, and has been seen to be quite forgettable. It includes its capable cast through a bad overly seen cop plot filled with holes and loose ends. Though exciting at times, it takes a while to get to the great parts.Triple 9 includes a variety and diverse ensemble cast but the characters we seen all have small and minor parts, where most of the characters are not likable. Lead by Case Afflect, it's quite clear the audience are supposed to root for him. The film's plot isn't as good when it comes down to the end, and not nearly as exciting as advertising. Perhaps too many characters which we did not care about. The film resembles a more gritty and violent version of Armored.Fortunately we are left with a big twist: The crooks are actually cops working for former Special Forces fighter Michael Belmont (Chiwetel Ejiofor). The loot is supposed to free his kidnapped son from the grip of a Russian-Israeli mob, but in movies like this there's always one more score. Once we get to the ending, the big twist does not fully capitalize the end result. Triple 9 was a decent result, but nothing more than a typical heist forgettable film.",Triple 9
22,eddie_baggins,A neat thriller that rockets along,7,11 September 2016,"Let's be clear, Triple 9 isn't a ""great"" film by any stretch of the imagination and it so easily could've been (just look at that cast!) but Aussie director John Hillcoat's star studded high octane thriller is a frequently uncompromising experience that should be a particularly solid experience for those that have enjoyed the likes of Training Day, End of Watch and gritty crime dramas of yonder years.Hillcoat, who is quietly crafting out an impressively consistent filmography on the back of his Australian classic The Proposition and fine Hollywood films The Road and Lawless, directs Triple 9 with an intense realism that starts out with a bang after a highly eventful opening stanza and the film barely pauses for breathe as it rockets along through double crosses, raids, philosophical musings and all that may fall between. Everything within Triple 9 feels short on time and with such a loaded ensemble its where the film falls apart as the audience is never given sufficient time to really get to know these characters, whether they be good or whether they be very bad apples indeed.Covering all the character tropes of genre films gone by, Triple 9 introduces us to a world featuring Anthony Mackie and Clifton Collins Jr's heartless cops/criminals, Kate Winslet's big bad Russian crime boss, Casey Affleck's new to the beat Gang Unit officer Chris Allen who in theory is supposed to be our main point of contact alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor's criminal mastermind Michael Atwood and along for the ride is Woody Harrelson stealing many of the films best scenes as a booze loving cop and even Jesse Pinkman himself and Daryl Dixon appear in the forms of Aaron Paul (sporting the years worst movie haircut) and Norman Reedus not to mention a pre-Wonder Woman appearance from Gal Gadot.To say any of these characters get enough screen time or enough fleshing out would be wrong (overall Matt Cook's script just isn't on point enough in this sense) and even if Ejiofor and Mackie try their hardest with their given screen time, we find ourselves in the rare case for modern day films that it would've benefited Triple 9 greatly to spend more time in an overall runtime sense to benefit these myriad collections of people and when the films overly rushed finale comes around, it does feel as though the filmmakers struggled with tying everything up in meaningful way after the many various narrative turns taken throughout proceedings.A crime thriller that could've quite simply been a genre classic had more elements fallen into place, Triple 9 is nevertheless a baggage free experience that doesn't skimp on the violence and darkness that has made itself known as a staple of John Hillcoat's works and while unlikely to be remembered in conversations in years to come, you could do a lot worse than Triple 9 when looking for your next slice of the cops v robbers life.PS – keep an eye peeled for a particularly colourful appearance from The Wire's very own Michael K. Williams! 3 ½ wig wearing Omar Little's out of 5",Triple 9
23,leonblackwood,An average thriller that could have been so just better! 5/10,5,3 September 2016,"Review: On paper, this movie ticked all the boxes, with its great cast and decent storyline but the director failed to produce something special and original. None of the cast pushed there characters to the limit, and there wasn't many scenes that stuck out in my mind when the movie had finished. It's an average heist movie, about dirty cops and the Russian mafia, who use the cops to do there dirty work but there was some depth to the characters and there was different elements to keep the movie interesting. It does take some time for the police to work out what is going on, which I found unrealistic, and the final showdown at the end was pretty disappointing. The heist scenes were no way near the great scenes in Heat, and I personally would have used Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson as the baddies and Aaron Paul and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the goodies. With that aside, there is a sense of intensity throughout the film, which I found quite enjoyable but the storyline could have done with some more work, mainly because it was a bit too straight forward. It seems like the audiences wasn't too impressed with the movie either, judging by the box office takings, which proves that a lot of people was expecting much more from this film, just like me. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by, Australian born, John Hillcoat, who also brought you the great Proposition with Guy Pearce and Ray Winstone, The Road and a couple of music videos for Massive Attack, Bob Dylan and Nick Cave. Although he hasn't made that many movies, a lots of stars want to work with him, mainly because of his impressive reputation and unique work methods but I was quite let down by this movie. It seems like he has taken all of his favourite movies, and tried to make a complex thriller, with the help of some A Class actors but he should have concentrated on making the movie unique by bringing something fresh and new to the masses, like he did with the Proposition. I'm still looking forward to his future projects but he still has a way to go before his name becomes established worldwide.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $23.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/drama/thrillers, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Aaron Paul, Kate Winslet, Gal Gadot, Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer, Clifton Collins Jr. and Michael Kenneth Williams. 5/10",Triple 9

Not for the sensitive of heart and not suited for the masses, who long for a happy ending.",9,2 July 2018,"BEWARE: NOT suited for the sensitive of heart, because there is some pretty gross violence in it. And definitely NOT suited for those who like to see a happy ending. NOT suited either for those who are sensitive to racial stigmas, a lot of reviews were mentioning this sensitivity.This director John Hillcoat dares to makes pictures that DONT PLEASE THE MASSES, hence the reviews of many people who dont understand the story or dont like to watch depressing stories. Depressing it is, but depressing can be brilliant, when it is directed with excellence. And it is excellent. Acting, story, editing, photography and soundtrack all are up there with the very best in Triple 9.The story is about a bunch of criminal cops who get pressured by the russian mob to do a risky heist for them. Double cross betrayal is the red line through this story in which almost everybody gets wasted through deceit. No fun watching this story for the masses, who long for a happy ending and long to see stereotypical glorious heroes. Enough of those movies have been made already. Dead boring to me. ""Triple 9"" is different though. It is depressingly, harsh and I was still shocked (and thrilled) by it, even after I had watched it over 4 times already.Praise for all the actors in it, but in particular for Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson, who play the good cops. But the gangsters are acting formidable too. A very surprising role for Kate Winslet as a russian mobster. I dont usually like Kate Winslet, but in here she truly portrays the coldest b*tch I have seen on the screen for years. Chiwitel Ejiofor must be mentioned also for his excellent portrayal of a father who inside is teared apart with silent desperation.This is truly an actors movie, (like all movies by director John Hillcoat are....) The formidable acting is what makes this movie surpass all the other mediocre dirty cop movies. EVEN THE BAD REVIEWS MENTION THE TERRIFIC ACTING PERFORMANCES IN IT.""Triple 9"" truly achieves a new level of brilliance, as far as dirty cops movies are concerned. Seen it several times already and it gives me the chills every time. ""Heat"" with Al Pacino and ""Training Day"" with Denzel Washington are better than this one. But ""Triple 9"" comes very close in the true to life portrayals of dirty cops and gangsters. It's a shockingly violent and suspenseful rollercoaster, which is an anti-dote for the usual glorification of violence in Hollywood.One of the toughest true to life portrayals of dirty cops recorded on the movie screen. Seen so many dirty cop movies, only a few are truly great and ""Triple 9 "" is one of them. If you like dirty cop movies then you just GOTTA see this one, it blew me away.",Triple 9

This is the new Heat and Man On Fire with awesome performances to boot, where they at the top of the league. You might feel the story gets a little muddled with so many bad asses, where your questioning, who's who? Two similar looking blacks for one. Lets start with Normus Reedus- (fantastic, in a short lived but striking performance) part of this bank robber gang, some of it's members, like the fabulous (Clifton Gonzalez Junior, an actor who always delivers) cops. When their latest bank robbery doesn't go exactly, thanks to some red explosive dye (consult movie cover) they're blackmailed into doing another robbery for they're boss, an unbelievable Winslet, like you've never or ever to see her again. She's a real nasty piece of work. Their next job, a real big one, they're forced to kill a cop, that poor SOB being Affleck, who'm at first I didn't recognize, where this fabulous actor, just puts in another unique performance, his wife Teresa Palmer, just nice scenery, popping up, a couple of times. This is a new age crime corrupt cop film, that reminds you a lot of Heat. What impels us through this story is the actor's splendid performances, and choices these corrupt cops have to make, as we know their world begins to crumble around them, where walls will start closing in. We know Winslet's sordid intentions too, for these guys too. As I said, a real nasty piece of work, a more, amped up and so similar portrayal of character to Kristin Scott Thomas, in Only God Forgives. Harrelson, as the detective in charge, gives one of his best and flawless performances, while being Affleck's drunk father too. This film (with an ""Oh No"" twist at the end, regarding one party) so badly copping flack, is worth the view for the performances alone, from a group of actors I love, about every main performance, top level, but it's Winslet's, you'll remember. She's Satan herself. Another film that kind of shares some similarities, was Street Kings, where this too, makes great use of L.A locations. Sure this film, isn't without faults, but exciting entertaining like this, falling into March of this new year, this is a event surprise. This film should go by another title: Why Does This Film Cop So Much Flack?",Triple 9
26,subxerogravity,A tangle web woven by a really stunning cast.,7,29 February 2016,"I went to see the movie because I remembered in the trailer that Antony Mackie was going to be in it as a crooked cop. He's becoming the man you want to check out in movies, so I checked it out.the movie ends up having a stellar ensemble cast which included Casey Affleck, Woody Harrison, That dude from Breaking Bad (bitch) and Dale from Walking dead. A lot of people capable of being the main character of the film but no one too big not to complement the ensemble. Everyone mixed together equally to make a fantastic piece of storytelling. Overall, the story was well done with a cast truly focus on bringing out a great story, and it had a lot of interesting elements. Reminds me a little of Martin Scorsese's remake of Infernal Affairs, The Departed, but the violence is not nearly as romanced and glamorized, it was more vengeful. Great cop drama.",Triple 9
27,stevendbeard,Star Filled Cops & Robbers,7,26 February 2016,"I saw ""Triple 9"", starring Chiwetel Ejiofor-The Martian, Salt; Casey Affleck-The Finest Hours, Gone Baby Gone; Anthony Mackie-The Falcon in the Marvel movies, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter; Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games movies, No Country For Old Men and Kate Winslet-The Divergent movies, Finding Neverland.This is a star filled cast in a cops & robbers story full of characters with varying degrees of badness. There are dirty cops, of course, but there are also good cops with bad ..... I guess you would say habits? Chiwetel plays the leader of a gang of criminals that uses military style techniques to pull off their heists. Anthony is one of the dirty cops on Chiwetel's parole and guess who he gets for his new partner on the police force? Yep, good, clean cop Casey, whose first job is to take down Chiwetel's gang. Woody is Casey's uncle and Woody is one of those inbetweeners; he is a good cop but sometimes, he will use drugs confiscated from busts. Kate plays the wife of a Russian Mafioso that is trying to get her husband out of prison by using Chiwetel's gang to procure items she needs for hubby's release. FYI: The movie title 999 is police code for an officer down. Chiwetel plans on having a police officer killed on one side of town, drawing all available units to that location and then he and his men can heist all they want in the opposite direction with little or no interference. I think I mentioned earlier about a star filled cast; I also recall seeing AAron Paul, Gal Gadot/the new Wonder Woman, Norman Reedus/The Walking Dead and Teresa Palmer. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. I enjoyed this one enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Triple 9
28,alindsay-al,A disappointingly average film,5,22 February 2016,The cast for this film really made me want to see this film but unfortunately this film fails to deliver. The premise of this film sees a group of bank robbers trying to make there last score with a unique method. Chiwetel ejiofor plays the main robber and he is a great actor. He does the best job possible in this role its just that his character is so unlikeable that you end up not caring about him. Casey Affleck plays the good cop in this film and He does a really good job in the role and probably gives the best performance in the film. Another good performance is by woody harrelson who plays the cop going after the crew and he gives a charismatic performance. Anthony Mackie gave some humanity to his character which made him the most likable of the crooks. Also aaron paul had an interesting role in the film that I kind of wished had been fleshed out a little more. The story is pretty by the numbers with not much new. There are some good relationships developed but overall pretty basic. Thev script was very dull and boring with not much going on either dramatically or humour wise. The style had some really good suspense to it that had me on the edge of my seat. But the film is a drag at times and goes on for a bit too long. Overall this is a really average movie that I wouldn't say is worth seeing.,Triple 9
29,kirbylee70-599-526179,Police Heist,7,15 August 2016,"Australian director John Hillcoat made one of the most depressing movies I've ever witnessed, THE ROAD. While it was well made and took a serious look at what it would be like to survive the end of the world as we know it, it was indeed a movie not to allow anyone on a death watch view. Then he made LAWLESS which was quite different, the true story of a family who made their money via moonshine in the depression era Virginia. So when I heard he had a new movie coming out I was interested to see what it would be like.TRIPLE 9 tells the story of bad cops gone worse. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Mike, the leader of a crew of thieves, among which are two police detectives, Marcus (Anthony Mackie) and Franco (Clifton Collins Jr.). Mike owes the Russian mob another score and the job they have him scheduled for is a seemingly impossible task. As the gang plots out a method to accomplish their goal the only thing they can come up with is to create a situation that calls for a ""triple 9"" distress call, officer down. The call will result in all officers in the area being required to lend assistance thereby leaving their intended target unguarded for a short period.But to do this there is one hitch. They must actually kill a fellow officer. While Marcus wrestles with this issue Franco is all about taking it on. The difference in characters makes for some interesting interaction between the pair. The decision is made and now they need to focus on just who they plan to set up.Around this same time Marcus has been assigned a new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). Chris has been on the force for a while and is the nephew of Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) a name to be reckoned with on the force. While Casey knows his way around police work he doesn't know the streets he's been assigned to like Marcus does. While partners they don't see eye to eye on how to handle things. When the crew decides to choose Chris as their target it's less difficult for Marcus due to the nature of their partnership.Problems come not from Marcus but from fellow crew member Gabe (Aaron Paul), an addicted criminal who thinks this is going too far. As the film progresses Gabe tries to be the voice of reason and get them to refuse the job. What he isn't aware of is that Mike has no option but to follow through. Failure to do so will result in not only retribution from the Russians but the loss of his son as well.The movie works on some levels and not on others. As a well-conceived story you can tell that a lot of thought went into this one. Like an onion layers are peeled away getting to what is really going on and it's never quite what it seems. That being said there is also not enough solid clues for viewers to pick up on the end result.The acting here is some of the best you'll find on screen, from the more well-known stars to those that are familiar faces yet not quite so familiar names. Collins is superbly slimy here as a cop who doesn't care who he kills and has no morals whatsoever. Mackie does a great job showing that he can do more than don wings for superhero movies. Affleck proves that he has no reason to hide in his brother's shadow. And Harrelson displays an ability that many would not have seen coming back when he played Woody on TV's CHEERS.The end result is a movie that's not bad but not necessarily good either. At just under 2 hours there are moments that shine while others simply feel like the pace plods along. Had those scenes been trimmed down, left out or just written differently that might not have been the case but as is they offer moments where I found myself yawning and dozing occasionally. Do the good sequences make up for the bad? I would say yes they do but know going in that the movie will not be a slam bang shoot 'em up that the trailer might have you believe. Realize that not everyone is going to walk away in the end and that the true story of what is going on here is deeper than you realize. If you do so you just might enjoy this one.",Triple 9
30,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Blistering romp in the uber violent crime fields,9,27 February 2016,"John Hillcoat's Triple 9. Bloody. Nasty. Blistering. Nihilistic. And surprisingly deft in its presentation of character. The only clear cut, out and out protagonist is Casey Affleck's Marcus Allen, a young detective with a wife and kid, brutally unaware that he's been targeted by a group of stunningly dirty cops and a few ex special forces hardcases to bite the dust in a planned homicide, sparking an 'officer down' over the airwaves to distract the force from what's really going down. With the exception of his straight arrow heroics, the entire rest of the cast is a snake pit of depraved, slimy, reprehensible degenerates, populating a decayed, gang infested Atlanta where the cops are just as likely to empty a clip into your skull as the cholos. Chiwetel Efjor plays Atwood, leader of a most unfortunate crew of misfits who are forced to perform near suicidal heists for tyrannical Israeli-Russian mafia witch Irena (a bleach blond, terrifying Kate Winslet). Their newest venture is so impossible that they're attempting to use a slain officer as a ditch effort to get their stake. Of course it all goes to high hell, as we've come to expect and love in these type of films, with bullets, profanity, self destructive behaviour and wanton violence languishing all over the screen in glorious excess. Efjor is crackling good, showing brief glimpses of humanity in a dude who has lost his soul down a deep dark well, a caged animal fighting tooth and nail to no avail. The rest of his crew spend the film savagely trying to out - sleaze each other, and I mean that in the best way possible. They are really a bunch of snot rags, and this is a group of outstanding actors having bushels of fun being irredeemable bad boys. Anthony Mackie is walking C-4 as Efjor's right hand, a guy rotten to the marrow with moral conflict. Norman Reedus leaks grease as an ex special ops prick and their getaway driver. I didn't think Aaron Paul could be anymore despicable than in breaking bad, but somehow manages it here, playing a dude so grungy you'll squirm. It's Clifton Collins Jr. who scores the points though. He hasn't had a great role in years and he comes out blazing as the icy sociopath of the group. Then there's Woody Harrelson. Oh, Woody. He's clearly having a ball as Affleck's stoner uncle and high ranking cop. He spends the entire film ripped off his gourd on joint after joint, and take it from me, he knows how to play stoned impeccably. Despite the laconic bumbling, he shows that fire and ferocity we've come to know from him in brief unmistakable flashes, especially where it matters. Throw in Teresa Palmer as Affleck's loving wife and Gal Gadot in full slut mode and you've got a cast for the time capsule. Hillcoat wastes not a second in propelling his narrative forward with the force of a bulldozer, giving us minute moments of respite amongst the surging monsoon of bloodshed and dirty deeds. Composer Atticus Ross whips up a foreboding, hair raising war cry of a score that kicks in from the first frame and doesn't quit till the last shell casing has hit the ground. The only misstep the film makes is killing off its best actor way too early on, but its not enough to be an actual concern or hurt it overall. If sickeningly satisfying ballets of blood, broken limbs and morally bankrupt people engaging in all kinds of giddily fun criminal activities are your thing, this is a great way to kick off the year, cinematically speaking. Hell even if it's not your thing go check it out. It'll shake you up and then some.",Triple 9

They are working on a Salvadorean gang.Unfortunately the boss lady lied and this wasn't their last job. She kills the known new guy and forces the gang to do one more job: to steal info on her from a Homeland Security-contracted facility, which is an impossible job in the time they have before police arrive. The only way to get some extra time is to commit a triple 9--code for an officer down--elsewhere in Atlanta to distract police. One of the corrupt cops actually volunteers to kill a fellow cop. But they decide the victim will be the new rookie partner and they will get the Salvadoreans to do it. But the problem guy from the earlier heist suddenly shows up and ruins their plans. In the end a cop does get killed giving the rest of the team time to steal the info. When they leave the facility cops are there, but they somehow manage to escape easily, do the exchange with the mob and get their money. But by now things get more complicated as the mob isn't one to keep its word and the cop chief is starting to figure things out.Triple 9 is nearly 2 hours long and has a somewhat complex story. Well, the story isn't so complex, but the characters aren't established at all and dialogue is unclear at times. The initial heist should be a bit longer and more thrilling. But overall, this is a very thrilling movie. You end up hating the villains. With everyone somewhat dirty there isn't one character to really root for.

33,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Triple 9,6,27 February 2016,"Atlanta, GA as a locale, almost projected itself to be the main character in 1981's Sharky's Machine. Cut to 2016 and Triple 9 (my latest review) portrays ATL as modern-day Beirut.With assured direction by John Hillcoat (Lawless), a capable cast, and Kate Winslet going almost unrecognizable as a Russian Mafia associate, ""9"" belongs in a cinematic guilty pleasure of mine: The crime thriller drama. Immediately after viewing its trailer (in December), I was reminded of Illinois native/badass screenwriter David Ayer. Granted, this isn't the David Ayer of Training Day and Street Kings (two of my favorites in the genre). Triple 9 is more like Sabotage David Ayer being Georgia- based, dirtied up, and lacking in emotional resonance not to mention secreted tension. Yeah heads are dismembered, officers go rogue, tats are abundant, and street gang initiations get mucky. ""9"" doesn't however, shake you with these images. It's just another day where actors talk tough and draw blood.Including a lot of troupers that fade in and out while harboring admirable screen time, Triple 9 tells the story of two corrupt cops (Anthony Mackie as Marcus Atwood and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Jorge Rodriguez) teaming up with three hardened criminals (played by actors Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Norman Reedus). Their initial mission: Commit robbery by stealing a safety deposit box holding information that could help a Russky mob boss get out of prison. Their next mission: Commit the same volatile act yet with much higher stakes. The five gentlemen have to pull off a Triple 9 to get it done. A Triple 9 according to the film's title, is a maneuver where an officer down call sends every member of the heat to the location of the relegated incident. Casey Affleck (as Chris Allen) plays the honest cop who gets embroiled in said Triple 9, Woody Harrelson (as detective Jerry Allen) plays his concerning uncle, and Hotlanta plays atmospheric chic with its view of destitution and click click multitude. Viktor Bout called and he wants his guns back (ha ha).Now director John Hillcoat with his excessive use of close-ups, shoots ""9"" as if it's a horror snuff pic. He turns Atlanta's unsavory environment into a complete war zone. Most of the homicidal sequences featured are in broad daylight. And in staging several car chases and gunfights, Hillcoat renders every effect sloppy if not realistic and lifelike. His work behind the camera isn't necessarily the problem. It's the script by unknown Matt Cook and some rushed editing by Dylan Tichenor (Child 44) that become Triple 9's main Achilles' heel. Instead of effectively spouting long-winded soliloquies about (authentic) PoPo corruption and partaking in juicy one-liners (revert back to David Ayer, paragraph two), ""9's"" characters mire every word of dialogue in the form of F-bombs and muddled, good cop/bad cop arguments. Bottom line: With Triple 9's every stand alone kill, every obvious double-cross, and every exploding body part, you feel Denzel Washington did it better fifteen years ago by simply saying, ""King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!"" Rating: A mixed but strong 2 and a half stars. ""Number 9, number 9, number 9"". Natch.",Triple 9

35,bkrauser-81-311064,A Barely Passable Movie with a Good Movie Struggling to Break Free,6,26 February 2016,"There comes a point about halfway through watching Triple 9 where I wondered ""who should I be rooting for here?"" Director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Matt Cook do a marvelous job enveloping the audience into their dark and cynical world of warring gangs, corrupt cops, and hastily executed heists. They attempt to evoke a visual vocabulary similar to Heat (1995) yet the proceedings end up feeling more like Takers (2010) lacking the basic pacing and characters that leave any lasting impact.The term triple 9 is police code meaning Officer down/urgent help needed. This is the plot element that hangs precariously in the air for nearly one hour of screen time as a congress of corrupt cops (Ejiofor, Mackie, Paul, Reedus and Collins) plan a heist for the Russian mob. Blackmailed and desperate, the group finds an unwitting patsy in rookie cop Chris Allen (Affleck); nephew to notorious Detective Jeffrey Allen (Harrelson). Chris's death would result in the entire police department hunting down a cop killer leaving the crew to pull their heist in peace. What they didn't count on was Chris being so...smart? Crafty? Resourceful?Truth is the character of Chris does very little except absorb the myriad of coincidences that culminate in his setup. He's not admirable nor interesting nor particularly adept at police work and despite having comparable screen time to the rest of the ensemble, we know very little about him; other than he's into Black Sabbath. The mortality of his character is dependent not on cloak and dagger intrigue or a sense of indemnity but on blind, stupid luck. Only near the end does Chris have an opportunity to act on anything of consequence yet that heroes moment is robbed by Woody Harrelson who has pieced together everything and wraps it in a neat little bow for Chris.Well if the movie isn't interested in Chris then surely it's interested in the corrupt cops, right? Yeah, not so much; only Ejiofor is given more than a cursory glance and even then the movie seems to hinge his character's motivation on extensive moments of exposition. Those moments are provided by Ejiofor sharing over-the- shoulder shots with the incredibly underutilized Kate Winslet. While every other character enters and exits the film with little fanfare, her Russian mob wife character is a scarlet draped exclamation point to the otherwise stodgy ensemble. All the story elements that merge into the climactic final heist are lovingly pieced together for the audience. We are privy to all the information early on and watch as the unavoidable fates of all involved unravel; no one being wiser as a result. But to what end, is the million dollar question. The film seems poised to give an uncompromising view of brutality complete with dirty cops, ski- masked robbers, habitual drug use, poverty, degradation and lots and lots of grime. But while these images bombard the viewer, there's no depth to it. The editing, the story beats, the ever obnoxious shaky- cam, all work against this film to make a dirty, steamy hodgepodge of who cares.Triple 9 is a barely passable crime drama with a decent movie struggling to break free underneath bad pacing and bad character development. Boasting an ensemble cast of one Emmy winner, one Academy Award winner and three nominees, you'd think this movie would be much better than it is. Sadly, it's purely a time-waster worthy of a rental tops. On a side note, for a city located in post- 9/11 U.S.A., you'd think Atlanta would be a little more serious about its car-bomb situation.",Triple 9

It opens with rapid pace, and only able to maintain it partially due to too many erratic subplots which barely sync with each other. The actors do a respectable job on creating a sense of urgency, yet most of the characters are one dimensional and not entirely likable.Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a former special force forced to do Russian mob's bidding, meanwhile Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) is a detective recently transferred into the town. They will eventually cross path while Jeff Allen (Woody Harrelson), Chris' uncle in investigating a particular heist. The whole scene is bogged down with intricacy and it becomes problematic to tell many perspectives smoothly.Actors deliver an intentionally crude depiction of shady or tired men, each of them has relative portion of screen time and they use it well. With the addition of Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie and Norman Reedus, this is a solid crew, but it sometimes stumbles on the narratives. Direction would wallow too much on certain subplot without creating any investment.The problem is their struggles, with the kid, job or family, are not easily approachable, especially since it tries to include multiple backstories and authoritative jargon. There are a few good moments, but these are standalone showcase. The continuity and build up are sketchy, this also includes the main point of views of Michael and Chris, which makes the movie feels lacking in term of the main leads.It shines best under stress of gunfire and explosion. The action just feels like they are trained and choreographed with precision, even the bits where characters would stumble or react accordingly in the site. Blood and shot carry their weight nicely. Recent action movies like John Wick or Equalizer tell their stories with style, but this kind of razor blade authenticity is equally refreshing.""Triple 9"" has a raw muddy grit for the action, unfortunately it applies to the narrative as well.",Triple 9

40,Troy_Campbell,Not essential viewing.,6,3 March 2016,"Since The Proposition was unleashed on audiences back in 2005, Aussie filmmaker John Hillcoat has made a name for himself as an uncompromising and ambitious auteur, bringing together A-list casts for bleak and uneasy thrillers. His latest Hollywood effort – following The Road and Lawless – dives into the grubby underground of Atlanta, where corrupt cops, ruthless bank robbers and Russian mobsters are often one and the same. A nice world this ain't. There's an unrelenting grimness to this noir-ish street saga that generates the desired mood, and the high level of dread permeating throughout proceedings maintains tension despite a predictably death-happy final act. Yet Hillcoat struggles to fully wrangle Matt Cook's twisty-turny screenplay; what could've been an intriguing web of lies, double-crosses and daring crimes becomes a less believable concoction of coincidences, plot contrivances and dubious character choices. Taking a leaflet out of Michael Mann's book of realistic action, the handful of set pieces are executed with flair, precision and unwavering violence, with an extended gun fight at the halfway point harking back to Mann's own Heat (albeit without topping it). Unfortunately the film is also let down by its vast array of players. Other than Casey Affleck's honest but worn-down cop, everyone else is evil and unpleasant to varying degrees – and rarely more than a caricature – making it hard to care about their fates. Hillcoat's menacing tone and visual ferocity ensure a certain level of interest and entertainment, but narrative and character weaknesses stop Triple 9 from being essential viewing.",Triple 9

A lot of the acting is somewhat over the top, but still convincing and fun.

42,Anurag-Shetty,A tense thriller.,8,17 March 2016,"Triple 9 tells the story of a bunch of dirty cops. These cops mainly, Marcus Belmont(Anthony Mackie) & Franco Rodriguez(Clifton Collins Jr.) work for the Russian mob led by, Irina Vlaslov(Kate Winslet). The other members on Marcus' crew are, Michael Atwood(Chiwetel Ejiofor), Gabe Welch(Aaron Paul) & Russell Welch(Norman Reedus). Irina orders the crew to pull off their most complicated heist, to date. In order to execute this heist, the crew plans to shoot a police officer & initiate a code 999 which means, officer down. This will distract all the cops in the city & the crew will be able to pull off the heist, without any difficulty. However, this plan is not as easy as it sounds. Triple 9 is a great film. The screenplay by Matt Cook, is a breath of fresh air in this industry of adaptations, sequels, reboots & remakes. There are tons of twists & turns in the movie, that will keep you guessing, right till the end. The first thirty minutes of the film are a little slow, compared to the breakneck pace of the remaining ninety minutes. This is the only flaw in the movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Michael Atwood. It is nice to see Ejiofor portray a character, with gray shades. Casey Affleck is great as Chris Allen. Anthony Mackie is spectacular as Marcus Belmont. Mackie's questionable character, is a far cry from his superhero turn as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Woody Harrelson is amazing as Jeffrey Allen. Aaron Paul is excellent as Gabe Welch. Kate Winslet is awesome as Irina Vlaslov. Gal Gadot is impressive as Elena Vlaslov. Norman Reedus & Teresa Palmer are effective in their minor roles as Russell Welch & Michelle Allen, respectively. Clifton Collins Jr. is superb as Franco Rodriguez. Triple 9 is a must watch for everyone who loves action thrillers.",Triple 9
43,dave-mcclain,"""Triple 9"" is triple bad, which is pretty good (mostly).",6,6 March 2016,"Reliable statistics regarding how many corrupt cops there are in America are hard to come by, but by all accounts, the vast majority of all law enforcement officials are well-trained, hard-working, honest individuals who do the best job they can under challenging, complicated and sometimes life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately for them, there aren't many movies made (or cell phone videos, for that matter) about good cops doing the right things. Gritty stories about corrupt cops sell more movie tickets. And why not? Those of us who respect the police still enjoy the occasional crooked cop film – if it has a good story – and the bad guys get what they deserve. So, does ""Triple 9"" (R, 1:55) fit the bill? The first big scene in the movie shows us a gang of masked men robbing an Atlanta bank with military-style planning and precision – and a clear understanding of how long they have to take care of their business in the bank before police will arrive. Even when we get to know these men, we don't know how they initially got together, but they're clearly professionals well, most of them are. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the leader of this gang of five. He's a former military special operator, as is fellow gang member Russell Welch (Norman Reedus), who was the driver at the bank job. These two work with two corrupt cops, Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins, Jr.). The last member of the crew is Russell's little brother, Gabe (Aaron Paul), who is the one sensitive criminal in this gang, and also the biggest screw-up. Although none of these guys are winning a Man of the Year Award any time soon, the reasons they pull the jobs in the movie extended beyond just pure greed. They have become entangled with Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), the wife of an imprisoned Russian mob boss – and she threatens the lives of the families of the members of Michael's gang in order to get what she wants.What Irina wanted from the bank was a single safe deposit box, which contained information that could free her husband but the contents of the box end up containing only part of what Irina needed. She refuses to pay Michael and company until they pull one more heist for her, a demand that she backs up with threats and violence. The second job involves the gang breaking into a facility run by the Department of Homeland Security. They agree that they'll never be able to get in and out before Atlanta's finest arrived on the scene... unless the police response could be somehow delayed. Marcus suggests killing a cop to create the necessary diversion. He explains that ""Code 999"" means ""officer down"", a radio call that would send every available cop in the city racing to the scene. The others agree with the plan, but they're not all exactly enthusiastic about it. Marcus suggests his new straight-arrow partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), as the sacrificial lamb and uses the investigation of a gang killing (that left three severed heads on the hood of a car) to talk to bad dudes like Luis Pinto (Luis Da Silva) who might help out with his plan. Hovering over this scenario is Chris' uncle, Detective Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) who himself has gotten pretty jaded over the years, but is determined to protect his young nephew. Let's just say that the goals and desires of all these characters become challenging.""Triple 9"" is original and entertaining, but very dark. Its gritty reality reminds me of 2006's ""Miami Vice"" film and the impressive heists reminded me of a hardened version of the ""Oceans"" films. Putting corrupt cops together with former military in a single gang is interesting, and almost as unusual as seeing orthodox Jews as Irina's henchmen. The ensemble cast is great (and, according to director John Hillcoat, pretty tough to get together considering how in demand they all are). Watching them is especially entertaining when you realize that this is the first time that you've seen some of them playing such nasty characters. (The last time Affleck was in a movie with Harrelson – in 2013's ""Out of the Furnace"" – Harrelson was trying to kill Affleck. Besides that, the dedicated detective from ""Secret in Their Eyes"" and Falcon from those Marvel movies have both turned out to be downright unheroic. And to think that Young Rose from ""Titanic"" ended up as a Jewish Russian mob boss. Jack would be so very disappointed!) Come to think of it, these characters may just be a bit too nasty. It's a little hard to believe that a gang of people with such a low average morality quotient would include police officers and former military members – and the number of unanswered questions in the story makes it even harder to believe (or completely understand) what we're seeing. I also found the ending unsatisfying and anti-climactic. Either way, if you watch this movie as if you were involved in a high-speed police chase through a bad neighborhood, ignoring the distractions, keeping your eyes on the road and not worrying about what happens when the chase comes to an end, you'll be in for a pretty wild ride. If you like cop movies (even if they're dark) and heist films (even if there are hardly any good guys), this is the movie for you. ""B""",Triple 9
44,swilliky,An intense cops and robbers thriller,7,29 February 2016,"Director John Hillcoat (The Road, Lawless) takes his Wild West vision to the mean streets of Atlanta, GA, my old home town. The cast was stacked with big names like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Aaron Paul, and Kate Winslet. This long list isn't used to their total potential but still this movie is full of tense scenes and an entertaining heist movie. This cops and robbers drama works with the shades of gray when the cops turn out to be working with the bad guys. The tension heats up when Anthony Mackie's Marcus and Clifton Collins Jr.'s Franco as the two corrupt cops decide that the best way to distract from a robbery is to kill a fellow office, in this case Casey Affleck's Chris who also happens to be a major crimes detective's nephew. The uncle is played by a pot smoking dope snorting Woody Harrelson.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Triple 9
45,bob-the-movie-man,The Thin and Crooked Blue Line,6,28 June 2016,"Triple 9, set in the gun-ridden streets of Atlanta, is surprisingly well executed and at times impressive to look at. But it does leave a rather unpleasant after-taste: like last year's Liam Neeson vehicle ""Run All Night"", virtually no one in the film has a redeeming feature which makes it difficult to empathise or root for anyone.The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Twelve Years a Slave"") plays Michael Atwood, the leader of a gang doing a bank job for the Russian mafia led by Irina Vlaslov (Kate WInslet). The gang stay one step ahead of the local cops by plotting patrol car movements on a GIS map: that's pretty easy for them since they are all crooked cops and ex-military. Atwood's character is intimately linked to Vlaslov's, as he has a son with her sister Elena (Gal Gadot). But the mafia is not easy to please and Atwood is strong-armed into doing a second, more challenging job that requires a significant police diversion. This diversion is the root of the ""999"" of the title: the call sign for ""officer down"". Investigating the robbery and the subsequent chain of events is flawed cop Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), who is also trying to help his nephew Chris (Casey Affleck) aclimitise to the city's gang culture following a transfer from a much cushier neighbourhood. The strands of the story intertwine to violent and bloody ends as Atwood fights to protect his family and escape the ever-tightening grip of the mafia and the closing net of Harrelson's dogged detective.All the performances here a generally excellent. Ejiofor is an actor who perfects the look of being totally hacked off, and here he has plenty of opportunities to exercise that. His closest colleague Belmont (Anthony Mackie, Falcon from the ""Avengers"" films) is also extremely watchable. Elsewhere, the shapely Miss Gadot is a little too one-dimensionally drawn for my taste, but the other members of the gang and Harrelson and Affleck as the two 'good guy' cops are nicely portrayed. The most surprising turn though is that of Winslet who revels in her evil Russian bitch persona, a role diverging from her usual norm and which is great to watch. The story and screenplay by newcomer Matt Cook is sufficiently dense to require attention in following it – it reminded me in places of ""LA Confidential"" – and like that film contains enough twists and turns to keep up the interest. Character development though is limited, so when the twists do happen its an ""oh"" rather than an ""OH!"". The screenplay is let down by a bit of a damp squib of an ending and one that doesn't bear close scrutiny – if you've seen the film, the hero is SURELY in more imminent peril in the two minutes preceding the denouement?? But the journey to get to the ending is satisfying enough. Cinematography (Nicolas Karakatsanis, ""The Drop"") and film editing (Dylan Tichenor, ""There Will be Blood"") are also worthy of note, particularly with the impressive opening titles which straight away tell you this is not just A.N.other cop 'B' movie.The robbery scenes and one involving a police raid on an apartment building are both well edited and exciting. So, in summary, a good solid job by director John Hillcoat (""The Road"") that is worthy of your rental dollar. Just make sure you have some TV/movie 'sorbet' to cleanse the palate after watching.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)",Triple 9
46,silvermistvio,One of the worst films I've ever watched.,1,6 October 2019,"I had this film over 2 or 3 years. But I've never had a chance to watch. I planned to watch it several times. But the other films took over and so, I watched the other ones instead.I'm glad that I didn't watch it before until now because of the quality of this film. This is one of those films that I've stopped watching in the middle. The main reason is that the film is so boring and dull. Plus, there are a lot of f words which make me uncomfortable. And what they want to show isn't that much clear. Even the involvement of Kate Winslet couldn't save the film. I can't believe that she's in this dumb film. Thus, it's totally a bad film of the year 2016.Talking about Kate Winslet, I also can't quite believe she uses in Russian accent. That's kind of strange thing to see. I'm not that much fan of Russians, so, it's very not good to see her as a Russian.The reason why the film is bad is that it doesn't show things clearly. In the very first scene, they robbed bank and took a box from the bank. But they didn't explain what that thing is. Moreover, the ones who did that robbing are police officers. What made them to do robbing instead of simply do police jobs? Furthermore, they didn't explain the connection between those Mexican people and the head thing. I don't even know why they are shooting at those Mexican people. From the beginning to the middle of the film, I was watching blindly. That's why I said this film is so bad.All in all, I really had high hope for this one as it has over 6 rating here on IMDB. So, I thought it might be a good film. But after watching the half, I really disappointed. How did they make such a bad film? The film is really terrible and there are a lot of good films out there. Leave this one and go watch the other films instead. Watching this one isn't worth to spend time and money. So, I recommend you NOT to watch this one if you value your time and money.",Triple 9

At all, in fact I found myself thinking of other random stuff because it failed so deeply at engaging me as a viewer to care what's going on.Now I usually really enjoy corrupt cop flicks, some of my favorite movies are corrupt cop flicks like 'Gang Related (1997)' and 'Training Day (2001' but this one just failed.Now the characters in these kinds of films aren't usually a likable bunch (they are corrupt cops after all) but that's usually made up with good dialogue and a clever script and interesting characters, something that doesn't really exist in the movie.Most of the baddies are cut from the same tree there is nothing really separating from one and the other, the only reason I could tell them apart somewhat was because they were all played with familiar actors otherwise I would probably been completely lost by the plot.Casey Affleck's and Woody Harrrelson's characters are the only ones that truly seem to have their own ""ID"" (and maybe Kate Winslet but she comes off as stereotype, playing a Russian mobstress).

50,CANpatbuck3664,A Gritty and Well Made Cop/Heist Drama That Wasn't The Whole Package,7,6 March 2016,"I was surprised at the lack of push this movie got. This is quite the ensemble of Academy Award nominees (Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson and Chiwetel Ejiofor), current and future blockbuster stars (Anthony Mackie and Gal Gadot) and prominent T.V. actors (Norman Reedus and Aaron Paul). You would think that alone would help it secure more attention when it was released. John Hillcoat's past work is more on the artsy side but his films have been largely well liked. I didn't see much of the marketing material for Triple 9 but when I read the plot synopsis, it seemed like it could be a lot of fun. I'm still glad I saw it but anyone expecting an End of Watch, The Town or Training Day calibre movie (which are the first three movies that come to mind in comparison to Triple 9) will be disappointed.The movie opens with a bank heist in Atlanta, Georgia. The crew is performing it compromised of 5 people. The two leaders are Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who functions as the point man in the bank and Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) who is the getaway driver and relays the instructions to the team about police presence and the timing of the job. The other members are Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie), Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul) who is Russell's brother. It's important to remember that Marcus and Franco are dirty cops. They enter the bank and target a specific safety deposit box. They are in and out quickly and they exit in a separate vehicle from Russell who is still in a truck. It all seems to be going well but Gabe grabbed some cash in the vault and the dye pack explodes while they're driving away. The vehicle is compromised and it leads to them having to hold up someone else while they blow up their original van.The crew is understandably angry at Gabe at the drop off point, especially his brother. They are working for the Russian mafia in Atlanta, Georgia which is being led by Irina Vaslov (Kate Winslet) because her husband is in prison. What's also important to know is that Michael is involved with Irina's sister Elena Vlaslov (Gal Gadot) and they have a child together. While Michael works for them, he and his crew were supposed to be released from any obligation but that is no longer the case, Irina has another job for them and if they don't do it, there will be consequences.If you know anything about Triple 9 beforehand, you'll notice that my early plot description doesn't include Casey Affleck or Woody Harrelson. The reason for that is that you don't get introduced to their characters till around 15-20 minutes in. One of the problems that I had with Triple 9 is that the flow of the plot is very unusual. It's always progressing and it's never boring but it doesn't really feel like there's any movement, especially in the middle of the movie. We find out that there's going to be another heist and the plan is formed but then nothing happens in regards to it for a solid third of the feature. I don't want to give anything away but the plan for the ending doesn't even come into play until there's about a half hour left in Triple 9. It isn't that there isn't anything going on but it was confusing to me and I wanted them to get back into it instead of another scene of the criminals mulling over whether they should do it or not.The other problem was that there wasn't much character development with any of the characters. To be fair, there's a lot of big actors and they all deserve screen time but you can't root for them because you know so little about them. Chris Allen is more or less our protagonist but other than that he has a family and transferred from another part of town, why should we like him? I guess it comes down to the fact he's the only non-corrupt character. The movie also wants to get behind Michael but other than the fact that the Russian Mob is holding his son hostage, we don't really know that much about him. His relationship with his Elena is also pretty cold, why does he care so much about her when all he does is cuss at her when they're around each other? Nobody gets to really dive in to their character because it's just not written there or there was a heavy editing job and all that stuff was on the cutting room floor.I don't want to be all negative about this movie because I did enjoy it. The acting is really good all the way around, they've got an impressive stable of actors here and they all do good work. I was most surprised with Kate Winslet. She was just the right amount of cold and cunning and she really held her own. It channels David Ayer's past work (Ayer is one of my favourite directors working right now) really well from how dingy and gritty it looks and how intense it can be at times. I mean that as a compliment and I really enjoyed it from that angle.I was with this movie up until the end and it offered a couple of good twists in its ending. Triple 9 is hard to rate though. There's great acting and the movie looks cool but when I sat back and looked at it, there seemed to be a lot of stuff missing. There's very little character development over the huge cast and the movie tricks you into thinking it's moving faster than it does. I like heist movies so I'm glad someone is still trying to make a good ensemble heist movies. I'm just going have to split the good and the bad and arrive at a 7.",Triple 9

52,Rickting,Semi-decent heist movie,6,20 February 2016,"Triple 9 is a complicated heist movie involving a lot of double crossing, corrupt cops, plot twists and rug pulls. A team of bank robbers, being blackmailed by the Russian Mafia, have to pull off a nearly impossible heist which involves killing a cop. T9 immediately stands out among the many similar movies out there because it has a great cast and the director, John Hillcoat, has proved himself before to be a good filmmaker so T9 looked promising. In the end, it's a mixed bag. Hillcoat manages to make the shaky cam style of the cinematography work well for once and there is plenty of tension. Thankfully, each set piece doesn't just feel like a repeat of the last and overall it's safe to say it's a well made thriller. The cast, unusually strong for this type of movie, all do a good job. Anthony Mackie stands out in a more gritty, dramatic role than some of his earlier ones, and Chiwetel Ejiofor owns the movie. That being said, it would have been nice to see more of Aaron Paul, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet. This isn't a predictable movie, and there are plenty of shocks and tense moments, but it's not always that enjoyable. With its mean spirited atmosphere and convoluted plot, it just didn't quite hold my attention the whole time. The script is OK, though the story feels rushed at times and it's not as good as it could have been as a result. It's perfectly good though, and better than some of the stuff we usually get at this time of year. It'll probably sink at the box office, but it's worth a look.6/10",Triple 9

He may have been watching a picture like TRIPLE 9: it's almost entirely shot in darkened rooms, cars, warehouses, underpasses. And - as so often now, not just in cops-and-mobsters movies - the dialogue is mumbled, impossible to understand without subtitles.Set (I think) in Atlanta, this is another story about good cops and bad cops; we aren't (I think) meant to know which are which. The good cops are fighting the local Russian mafia who have suborned the bad cops. Casey Affleck, looking a lot like like Bruce Willis in DIE HARD mode, is definitely a good guy, but I wasn't sure about Woody Harrelson in a phoned-in performance as a police captain. Kate Winslet, sporting a blonde version of Monica Lewinsky's collapsed beehive, (can Kate be this hard up for money?) has a souped-up cameo as a mobster's moll or possibly missus: her accent, somewhere between Golders Green and St Petersburg, was easier to understand than any of the Americans. There's a bank robbery, some car chases, several shoot-ups: nothing new here.My companion walked out two-thirds of the way through. I managed to stay to the end but wish I hadn't.

55,PyroSikTh,"Awesome Director + Awesome Cast = Win-win, Right?",7,23 February 2016,"It didn't take much convincing to get me into the cinema for this one. I've been looking forward to it for a while, not for it's content and concept, but purely for the names attached. John Hillcoat has yet to make a bad movie, and I figured him finally tackling present day could yield some interesting results. Pairing him with his biggest and most impressive cast yet could only bring further promise.Unsurprisingly, Triple 9 is driven by it's characters, with a handful of impressive, gritty action setpieces to keep the audience's attention. We follow characters on both sides of the law, including the murky grey in the middle, but no-one is particularly likable. We have Mike, head of the criminal crew plotting an officer down code as a distraction. He's in with the (Jewish?) mob more than he'd like by way of having had a son with the boss' sister, Elena, giving Irina, the boss, more leverage over him than he'd like. His crew is made up of army buddy Russel, his deadbeat brother Gabe, Gabe's Gang Unit cop friend Marcus, and another dirty, somewhat psychotic cop Franco. Marcus has just been assigned a newbie as a partner; Chris, who just so happens to be the nephew of Jeff; the head of the Homicide division. Of course with such ties, it's the newbie who ends up as the target of the triple nine.Each one gets varying degrees of character development, but due to their being so many characters, it's unsurprising that there might not be as much as you might hope. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike as a sharp leader who's just unhappy with his situation and what he's made to do for the sake of his own son. Kate Winslet hams it up a little bit as Irina, but never quite reaches the amount of intimidation required for the role, and you wonder why Mike doesn't just shoot her in the face and be done with it. Casey Affleck is a little dull as Chris, who's probably the most likable character by accident, having no discernible character beyond being the guy thrown into a world he doesn't entirely understand. Anthony Mackie, however, manages to bring a bit more depth to Marcus than any other character/actor. As the guy tasked with initiating the triple nine, he suffers a strike of conscience at inconvenient times, but is still ultimately a corrupt cop. Aaron Paul does what he does best with Gabe, which is walk around lost with tears welling up the whole time, although in Triple 9, at least his character has good reason. Clifton Collins Jr. plays the semi-psychotic Franco with as much cold heart as is necessary without making the audience wonder how he got passed the police tests in the first place. Woody Harrelson's Jeff is the well- meaning drunkard, who is as close to a show-stealer as Triple 9 gets. Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Michael K. Williams all make small and underdeveloped appearances throughout, as Russel (the only guy on the crew who seems to have his head screwed on), Elena (who exudes bad mother), and Sweet Pea (transvestite pimp who has her ear to the ground) respectively.In truth, the impressive cast was necessary just to be able to keep track of who was who at times. There isn't enough time to get particularly attached to any of them as the plotting keeps the movie moving quite thoroughly, although I must note there were some questionable holes (such as, you have the guys son, why not use him rather than offing one of his crew members and making it infinitely harder for him to get the job you want done). Dotted about are some smatterings of action, and to be honest, this is where the film's strength lies. The movie opens with the bank job that doesn't quite go to plan as Gabe gets a bit greedy, resulting in them all covered in red dust. Of course there's the second half of the job which makes up the movie's climax in the third act as well, but in the middle we switch perspectives a bit and follow a police raid in the heart of Mexican gang territory, and absolutely marks the movie's high point.Story wise, holes aside, there's quite a lot going on and quite a lot to keep track of. Everyone seems to be interrelated somehow, and it can take a bit of work on the audience's part to connect all the dots together. Most of the plot is focused around the characters themselves, as I've mentioned, but it cleverly uses this to guide the outcome of the movie. It feels like the writer came up with the idea, came up with the characters, and then threw them together and followed them individually along the timeline to figure out how they'd end up at the end, and what their role would be. This results in some fairly unpredictable twists and turns that make complete sense from the perspective of the characters.In all Triple 9 is a solidly enjoyable movie. It's not the masterpiece I'd hoped for, marking itself probably as Hillcoat's worst movie, but that's not really saying a lot as all his work is top-tier. Every actor does their job to the best of their ability, hamstrung only by the amount of time and space they get given to work on their characters. Triple 9 is less than two hours in length, but there's a lot to fit in, which makes it feel like quite a long movie. Thankfully it never rushes through, and makes enough time to linger on moments a little longer than you might expect. I give Triple 9 an enjoyable 7/10.",Triple 9
56,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,21 April 2016,"A great ride, one of those that reminds you why the police-crime drama genre has never, ever left the silver screen and why after decades it still remains as timeless and engaging as ever, why its potential for thrill is so high and when delivered right what it can achieve. ""Triple 9"" certainly has some of that, it isn't by any means a revelation nor a revolution on the genre, but it is dam well worth its time.Opening with a great bank robbery right up until the very last shot, the film never slows its rhythm down and has a tight pace which always keeps things moving and interesting. Thanks to a very well assembled cast we are introduced to a stack of characters that all have a distinctive beat on screen which helps enormously in keeping you up with the plot. These aren't certainly highly original characters and the ensemble is just as predictably cast, no one is surprising in a role or unpredictable, yet there really isn't any reason to complain for this since all of them are very committed and just flow in the movie without leaving space to the viewer for second thoughts. That being with the exception of Kate Winslet which is distractingly cast in a role that clearly doesn't belong to her, yet still she is so amazing she manages to own it, but the fact remains that every time she is on screen you are thinking that is Kate Winslet doing a Russian accent...why? We also have to thanks director John Hillcoat for a very ambitious and complex staging. It is very strange to see this film receive such a mixed reception. I personally saw a lot going on and felt the passion Hillcoat brought to the project. There is a lot that can be said: the subtle use of red lights as a foreboding element, the incredibly perfect blocking and staging of action sequences, the very complex use of various camera movements that get molded into a very coherent tone, the understanding of the intricate plot that is presented to us in a very clear and visual way which makes the film very simple to follow even if there is a lot of interlacement between different characters and situations. Hillcoat does miss the mark in a few beats, one key towards the end where the editing is really off, but that's all and overall this is very well directed film, it is unfortunate to see it go so unnoticed.Where is can be criticized a little more is in its writing. Don't get me wrong this is a enviable screenplay that I only wish I wrote, but looking it from a distance there are a few key elements that needed a final rewrite. The closing for one is a little murky and could have done with a little adjustment on characters being where they are and their motivations, it is also victim of the fact that there is a key beat in the film involving ironically code 999 that, whilst in the complex of the film it doesn't make things collapse, it still preserves a slight convenience about it that could have been easily solved in a rewrite. But that's it, this script is really tight and whilst a little by the book in its rounding of characters, it maintains a great complexity and momentum that are remarkable.I really enjoyed myself, I had a very good dose of thrill and can't see why this film didn't find a wider appeal, I think that its very superficial to judge it a generic, because there is a difference between being generically clichéd and actually committing to what might look from afar as 'seen-before' stuff, whilst in reality there is loads to be processed and enjoyed.",Triple 9

58,scottshak_111,Triple 9 is corruption intermingled with a heist story,7,21 July 2016,"The best thing about Triple 9 is that it has actors who can really act, and a director who can really direct. Just look at the star cast; you will be blown away to pieces by the number of veterans it packs. But the big question is does John Hillcoat use them enough? TRIPLE 9 THEME: GET YOUR SPOILER SEAT BELTS ON The movie justifies its moniker as it capers around the theme number of times. Pulling a Triple 9 as a diversion so that a robbery could progress unimpeded is what the movie endeavours to run its plot on. However, it focuses on everything else leaving out that perfect crime that it should have aced.Triple Nine movie also tries to weave a complex story that entails dirty cops getting greedy for moolah, Russian clients withholding money to get more jobs done, threatening the team and familia to see the latter through, and betwixt all the commotion pulverizing a clueless good cop.TERRIFIC DIRECTION OF TRIPLE NINE MOVIE The way Triple 9 has been helmed will leave you appreciating the knack Hillcoat retains for acing cop-robbery movies. His pace is stunning and will keep you interested. He does a good follow up of characters, ending his incessant runs at right moments. However, the weird thing about his direction is that he ends up focusing on triviality too much. Like that instant where he follows up what Gabe Welch was drinking (Jack Daniels) to make a point.MEDIOCRE HEISTS IN TRIPLE NINE Whilst you might have seen bank robberies a bazillion times in movies, you might wonder if Triple 9 heists have something to shake things up a little. Sadly it doesn't have that thrill to tingle your bones. The big question from the first heist is if they were doing it all for the money primarily, why didn't they go for the money from the banks in the first place? Overlooking that, and focusing on the good stuff, you see Chiwetel Ejiofor as Michael Atwood bringing in a rare charm through his demenaour. He walks around confidently, composedly seeing everything through, that will make you remember him for his finesse.The second heist is performed by just two men that makes it a downhill journey per se. But surprisingly things pan out for them. Watch out for that security guard leg though! CHARACTERS OF TRIPLE 9 Woody Harrelson's flair is as astounding as all of his roles that somehow put him in a cop story. Sadly the screenplay basket doesn't hold aplenty to gnaw upon. His character Jeffrey Allen build-up is not exactly heroic, but he still manages to reach there.Casey Affleck creates a superb comportment for Chris Allen. He carries this rare cool mien throughout the movie with that everlasting chewing gum that you can feel that character come alive.Anthony Mackie as Marcus Belmont is the next best thing to the tale. He is in a constant tussle with himself to pull a betrayal over Chris. Gabe Welch is the weakest link to the story as he tries to decimate the plans of the group suddenly with a change of heart. Even though Aaron Paul does fair justice to him, I wish the reason for him to turn should have been brought into the vanguard. Oooh Oooh Anthony Mackie calls him ""Bitch!"" one time. :P Constant follow up to the Michael Atwood story will have you take him for a heroic figure, but Matt Cook, the writer of Triple 9 has other plans for him. Kate Winslet does a fairly good Irina Vlaslov but you can't take her seriously for a mafia head. She doesn't come too strong although her screenplay fits her character like a glove.The most complex of all characters is that of Clifton Collins Jr. who plays Franco Rodriguez. You do not see him coming! The fact that everything sieves out on its own, might dilate your eyes though.The best part of the Triple 9 movie which was superbly shot was that 'breaking in the neighbourhood' scene. The mission is a constant follow up as Chris heads his team with a tactical. The shootout is absolutely thrilling to watch.OTHER PROBLEMS WITH TRIPLE 9 There are other downsides to triple nine apart from the aforementioned. For instance a lot of characters are simply there. I mean look at Gal Gadot who plays Elena Vlaslov. She becomes nothing but a sheer reference to her sister. There isn't a proper character development there. Norman Reedus gets the faintest of screen time. I wish he had more. His talent ends up getting smothered, like literally, in the first few frames itself.What constantly messes with the story is the fact that you are able to see everything through but unfortunately Chris isn't. He is blind like a bat, and it becomes hopeless at times, if it weren't for Jeffrey who constantly does the research and all the detective work. We could have done with a better climactic revelation kind of stuff in the end, which might have pulled the plot tauter. Also, the fact that Triple Nine goes a tad banal in the thrill department will have you miffed a little bit.Even though there is subtlety to how the movie ends, threads still remain open. You are forced to wonder about so many things, and loose ends that don't come to fruition. Every character is dispensable, so if you were saving your favourites, one recommendation: simply don't! At the end of it all Triple 9 still gets saved by powerpack performances by its stellar cast and brilliant direction.",Triple 9
59,coreyjdenford,Cop vs Dirty Cop,8,19 February 2016,"This is my review of Triple 9 (spoiler free)Directed by John HillcoatDistributor: Entertainment One.Cast: Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Academy Award Nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor*, 2 time Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson**, Aaron Paul, Academy Award Winner Kate Winslet***, Norman Reedus.Plot: A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan to kill an officer to pull off the biggest heist yet across the town.Casey Affleck stars as Chris Allen the nephew of Sergeant Detective Jeffrey Allen (Harrelson) the cop behind the investigation of catching the criminals, and figuring out who the corrupt cops are. Terrell Tompkins (Ejiofor) is the leader of the corrupt cops lead by Irina Vlaslov (Winslet), Winslet's stand out performance really puts the film together kind of like in last year's Steve Jobs.Although this dark and gritty cop thriller was almost never made by Australian director John Hillcoat (The Proposition, The Road), mainly because of production problems and loads of actors dropping out. For example Shia LeBeouf became Charlie Hunnam became Casey Affleck for Chris Allen, then Michael B. Jordan became Mackie as Marcus Atwood, Cate Blanchett replaced for Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz for Woody Harrelson. It's courageous yet patchy in parts but still gets the story through, but not as good as Dennis Villeneuve's criminally underrated Sicario (2015) it still is a gripping and action packed adventure. These are the reasons why I think this is a must see thriller:Captivating set-pieces: There are several set-pieces used in the film one of them even takes the film to the next level. The main set-piece that will grab your attention is the Ram Raid around the middle of the film, that is truly an original set-piece that is very gripping.Strong Cast: The cast really makes this film people like Chiwetel Ejiofor known 12 Years A Slave, and last years The Martian, Anthony Mackie plays The Falcon in so many Marvel films, Finally the real performance comes from Kate Winslet and her very convincing Russian accent. They make this film a must in my opinion.Finally with the amazing action and intense set-pieces this film is like Point Break vs Sicario and is truly a once in a life time thriller that will have you gripping your seat from start finish. Although it is not for the faint-hearted. Verdict: If you like Se7en and Animal Kingdom and very dark cop thrillers this is the film for you. 8/10 a must watch.*Best performance by an Actor in a leading role 12 Years a Slave (2013), **Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role The Messenger (2009) & Best Actor in a Leading Role The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), ***Best Actress in a Leading Role The Reader (2008).",Triple 9
60,Figgy66-915-598470,A gritty heist film,7,23 February 2016,"3 January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Triple 9. Controlled by the Russian Mob, a gang of corrupt cops carry out crimes in Atlanta and try to cover their tracks by staging a Triple 9, which means police officer down. However, when they are double crossed by the Russian Matriarch played superbly (but rather unusually) by Kate Winslet, they are desperate to find a way out of their rapidly imploding situation. A little hard to follow, it's worth sticking with as the plot twists and turns throughout. I'm sure Atlanta has some good points but in this film we saw nothing but the seedy underworld of the gangland city and the corruption in the police department......even the city itself looked neglected and dangerous. The innocent rookie in all this was played by Casey Affleck, and he brought a raw energy to his character as he was flung back and forth throughout the story. As previously mentioned, the unusual choice of Kate Winslet showed another side to her acting talents, as she ruled her Mobster Family with a strong hand and slightly dodgy accent. A mention must also go for Woody Harrelson who played Casey Affleck's uncle. He brought two sides to the role, both the mean gritty cop and the caring uncle who looks out for his nephew, an understated role in the body of the film but played with his usual flair. It's worth sitting through this film as it keeps drawing you in right to the very end.",Triple 9

62,eshwarmail,Heavily inspired by the superior 'The Town' but lacks the focus and a character to root for,5,27 June 2016,"It is easy to get overwhelmed with the abundance of A-list actors in this ensemble cast but it quickly tires you down with its under-cooked run-of-the-mill script. One might look at it as a darker and brooder version of the superior 'The Town' but I don't think the makers were able to put the pieces of their puzzle together neither interestingly nor in totality. While the intention was to have a realistic depiction of dirty cops, junkies, heists and police reactions, every single character is hell bent on being heroic without a purpose and not a care for their dear lives - which is the most unrealistic one could see.999 for the uninitiated is a police code for 'officer down, all units respond'. A group of mercenaries and dirty cops - Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Marcus (Anthony Mackie), Gabe (Aaron Paul) and Russell (Norman Reedus) are to pull off a job partly due to money and a hold the Russian mafia led by mob boss wife Irina (Kate Winslet) has on Michael through his wife Elena (Gal Gadot) and son Felix. The investigators led by Jeffrey (Woody Harrelson) stumble on to a solid lead that could crack open the investigation while Chris (Casey Affleck) who joined recently is taken for a ride by Marcus with a devious intention.Couple of questions first - it is incomprehensible how each character convinces the other to do something risky and stupid with very little in return, above that is how the makers convinced each of these actors to do something just dull with so little in return. We are not just talking about the ones who are budding actors trying to make a mark like Anthonie Mackie or Aaron Paul - it has veterans like Kate Winslet and Woody Harrelson. While Gal Gadot hardly has any role to play, Kate Winslet's portrayal of a Russian mob boss is very B-grade. However it does have some good points like Harrelson's portrayal of the semi-good cop until the last scene, the way the car backs up when Michael was lying on the ground, the first heist with the red gas overflowing the car or the way the plastic explosive cracks open a guard's leg. They were inventive and well executed but hardly creates an impact on top of its dull background.Heavily inspired by the superior 'The Town' but lacks the focus and a character to root for.",Triple 9

But, a lot gets lost along the way. Rather, it starts seeming like a B grade version of The Departed, but sadly, it's the story that seems to be suffering from the deadly fate.The movie's events and motives behind the actions are simple enough to follow, but somehow feel as if they were not very well fleshed out. Clearly Mike wants his son Felix back, but, what and how is his relationship with Felix's mother, Elena? Irina's husband is in jail, OK, but why? Mike and his team are doing all these jobs for Irina's husband, but, though we know what the ""jobs"" are, we don't know what the job is, because we don't know what was promised, and what is being delivered. What is Marcus's fate and why didn't Franco just up and leave after he got the cash?Sure, perhaps some of these questions one can come to their own conclusion, and others were explained in some obscure fashion in the movie, but the problem is exactly that. Also, the pacing was very off; it needed time stamps perhaps, or a deadline, because you'd feel the movie is at one point, then it'll thrust you to another. My favourite aspect of this movie is without question, it's cast, I absolutely love it. Anthony, Casey, Chiwetel, Woody and Kate (I don't really have an opinion on her Russian accent), are actors I respect. Gadot kind of seemed useless in this movie, but, my is she hot...

66,stephendaxter,Some early complaints but an overall very engaging film,8,3 March 2016,"Triple 9 was a surprisingly very enjoyable film that played out like you average every day crime film with some differences here and there that made it quite unique. It is essentially about some criminals, corrupt cops, and the Russian mafia and how they all tie together in a mission to set up a seemingly impossible heist. One of the first things to note is the huge talented cast in this film, they include: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Clifton Collins Jr. And every single one of them i thought put in solid, convincing performances that helped me to stay invested in the early parts of the film. The film has an overall very dark and grim tone throughout that i really liked. There is not much fun to be had at all but it worked for the story they were trying to tell. The story is also very interesting for the most part which was great. But not everything was smooth sailing. The story mainly after the first act of the film was very engaging and it did a great job at blending the heist/crime elements with the action/thriller themes. There were some very intense moments that did have me holding my breath in anticipation of what may happen, which was great. Apart from maybe one or two instances the events of the film were not at all predictable, which allows you to anticipate and look forward to what was happening next. Some of the latter portions of the film introduced some mystery/thriller themes and reminded me a lot of Prisoners which is an incredible film. The film suited having a very dark tone as it doesn't sugar-coat any of the violent moments. It does get a little violent and gruesome at times but the gore didn't feel overdone or out of place like it does in many other action/thrillers. Here it added more of a sense of realism to the film and added to the gritty nature. It also had an interesting visual style that came through at certain times throughout the film that i really admired. This was most likely the work of Director John Hillcoat who has done some other very visually engaging films, although that isn't what he is known for. I wouldn't mind seeing the film again just to see some of the foreshadowing and little details that hint to events later in the film that i may have missed. The majority of the issues with the film occur in the first 30 minutes and it is mainly down to the pacing. There were some very exciting moments but there were also moments where it was starting to drag quite a bit and it took its time to move along. If it wasn't for the performances the initial parts of the film would have been very hard to watch. Some of the story elements early on were thrown at you a little too quick and it did get a little overwhelming. It did make more sense a little later but it was kinda messy at times in the first act of the film. One thing i wish the film did a little better was getting invested in some of the characters early on. Some characters it does a great job with getting you to care about their agendas and their situation but there were moments where it was trying to get you to feel more for some of the characters but because of the nature of the film or those characters you kinda don't... But that's just a minor thing. So in the end, apart from some complaints about the early parts of the film, it actually shaped up to be a very good one that you can definitely enjoy if you like the crime/heist genre. I don't know where a lot of the highly negative reviews for this film are coming from because this was in no way anything less than a good film. The ensemble cast was great, the story was engaging and it kept you invested in the character right till the very end. 7.9/10",Triple 9

Williams, Gal Gadot, with Woody Harrelson, and Kate Winslet. In TRIPLE 9, a crew of dirty cops is blackmailed by the Russian mob to execute a virtually impossible heist. The only way to pull it off is to manufacture a 999, police code for ""officer down"". Their plan is turned upside down when the unsuspecting rookie they set up to die foils the attack, triggering a breakneck, action-packed finale filled with double-crosses, greed and revenge. I'm just going to start the review by saying what anyone who has seen the movie was thinking, (for the most part) it is extremely boring. It has such a convoluted plot that feels so muddled and just, unfortunately, uninteresting. The cast members do a decent job, with the lead Anthony Mackie, who in my opinion was the best in this movie, as far as acting is concerned. Casey Affleck is fine too, but really nobody else brings their A game here as it is obvious as soon as you lay eyes on the movie. The cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis is really nice though, I will give it that. But it is just not enough, as the movie fails on so many levels and has so many apparent flaws that just can't be ignored. It has very few action sequences, especially for an ""action"" movie, but those few are actually very well handled by the director John Hillcoat.

The settings are the exact same for the organization run by Jack Nicholson's character in The Departed. What Triple 9 does better than The Departed is making the characters believable. They are still a complete mess, but make much more sense than the character actions in the end of The Departed especially. The biggest factor that makes me compare these movies is the body count at the end. Everyone is killed by someone, just like in The Departed, but this time the killers are much more believable. The run time is also much more reasonable with Triple 9, but all in all this movie is less memorable for sure. Shame the original score in this one is basically nonexistent and stands out by being so non-noteworthy.Would I recommend this movie then? Well, it is definitely a must watch for people who enjoyed the Martin Scorsese movie, or the original film Infernal Affairs (2002) which The Departed was based to. I think the film is average, but works well as a crime movie that it is. If you are in need for a crime movie, then you might as well entertain yourself with this one.",Triple 9
75,clarkmick33,Good Intense Action Experience,7,7 June 2016,"I found this action tale quite an intense and interesting experience if not playing on some major clichés. I found the pace of the movie pretty good managing to keep me interested throughout the movie and I liked the slow unraveling of the truth. There was no major events here it was more of a focused low-key look into how corruption can affect the lives of those who are involved. I liked the fact that there were really no heroes. Woody can play a bum cop so well. (Although I got a little confused with the initial cast of heist characters as they were under their masks half the time and the other half of the time they were in low light settings). I think it was a good solid action movie. (If you liked ""The Departed"" you will probably like this movie as well like me.)",Triple 9

77,urthpainter,All Star Cast Squandered,4,26 April 2016,"All star ensemble cast of dirty cops, ex military, a burned out detective, and strait shooter come together to create a miserable failure of a heist movie. Fans of Woody Harrilson and Kate Winslet will likely get something from watching this movie. Both roles are well tailored and cast: A substance abusing but competent sergeant detective who delivers dialog with stunning ease, and a black widow, icy criminal who sees everything around her as pawns she can bend to her will. Fans of Reedus, Affleck, and Ejiofor will be left wanting. Affleck is especially terrible. Perhaps he was trying for an effortless feel, but his performance lacks inspiration in a way that could be analyzed as a clinic on bad screen acting - a bad approach.And is he the main actor? Whose movie is this? What is the point? What is this movie trying to be? None of these questions are answered. It is not a stylized heist movie in the form of Ronin. It is not a deep look at the life of criminal, cop, or both like Heat. Perhaps as a cynical look at money and meaninglessness? Maybe, but the point is - this movie has a very uncertain nature, and delivers no satisfaction by way of entertainment, symbolism, or story.Can a movie without a clear lead actor work? Sure, many consider The Thin Red Line a great movie, with me among them. Funny that Woody is in both these movies that build a story by following multiple characters. But that is where the comparison should end. The Thin Red Line excels thematically, artistically, and ponders a number of interesting questions. Triple 9 is canine feces. Offering any compliments would be a stretch. Perhaps fitting too that the one good'ish guy turns in a terrible performance. All of Affleck's scenes fall flat, and at times its like a guy in solid costuming, hair, and makeup speaks his lines in front of a camera. This doesn't say anything good about the director either. A director who has done really good work in the past. In the end, it doesn't matter whose movie this is, or who we are supposed to care about. Triple 9 is a terrible movie that waists all collected talent.Not recommended. Perhaps a movie worth watching for sake of critique, a performance or two, and the sublime presence of Gal Gadot - otherwise take a pass. 4 out of 10",Triple 9
78,Oberrated,A lot of star power with no power,5,21 April 2016,"I am at a split when it comes to 'Triple 9'. On one end, there were few moments where I did enjoy the film. The actors are powerhouses and did what they could with the material given to them. Some plot points were interesting to me and had my attention and lastly, I am sure there is a certain symbolism behind the constant use of the color red that is shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there was way too much I did not enjoy. From start to finish, I hardly understood any of the characters connections to anyone. They are explained in as little detail as possible. It just was not my cup of tea as far as understanding who the characters were and what was their purpose. Kate Winslet was absolutely atrocious to me. From her seemingly forced role to her forgetful ""Russian accent"" as she seemed to forget she was Russian at times speaking perfect English and bouncing back to an ""accent"". The fan- favorite star power of Norman Reedus, Aaron Paul, Chiwetel Ejiofor and company was no where near enough to save this movie and draw enough of a crowd to make this movie even mistakenly good. Too many negatives and not enough positives. This movie is forgetful to me and nothing special. A few moments do not make up for a near two hours of confusion and plot holes.",Triple 9

However, this movie was so much better than I expected and I couldn't stop, pause or fast forward. I found all of the characters to be exceptional and important to the story line. I didn't think it would be as much as a nail biter as it turned out to be, but it is. I won't give anything away on this movie but it was well worth watching. I I hesitated for way too long before renting this movie. I found it to be highly entertaining with a view into a World that doesn't get all that much attention. I loved it!

One cop's son is used as a pawn by the son's mother, who is the sister of the Russian mob boss trying to get her husband out of a Russian prison. Follow that so far? Yep, it's pretty convoluted. As far as the casting, Aaron Paul as a useless junkie wasn't a good move. It is hard to feel sympathetic for his character, and you find yourself just wanting him out of the way as the movie progresses. Refreshing was a barely recognizable Kate Winslet as the Russian mob matriarch, and Casey Affleck not playing his usual morose type of character. Also, Woody Harrelson does a great job as Casey Affleck's uncle, an alcoholic detective on his last legs, but still with keen police instincts and the desire to protect his nephew's life and career as a young officer.",Triple 9
81,mikevonbach,Intense in places. But it Was no ABE LINCOLN Zombie Killer . no depth,6,24 April 2016,"It didn't take much convincing to get me into the cinema for this one. I've been looking forward to it for a while, not for it's content and concept, but purely for the names attached. John Hillcoat has yet to make a bad movie, and I figured him finally tackling present day could yield some interesting results. Pairing him with his biggest and most impressive cast yet could only bring further promise.Unsurprisingly, Triple 9 is driven by it's characters, with a handful of impressive, gritty action setpieces to keep the audience's attention. We follow characters on both sides of the law, including the murky grey in the middle, but no-one is particularly likable. We have Mike, head of the criminal crew plotting an officer down code as a distraction. He's in with the (Jewish?) mob more than he'd like by way of having had a son with the boss' sister, Elena, giving Irina, the boss, more leverage over him than he'd like. His crew is made up of army buddy Russel, his deadbeat brother Gabe, Gabe's Gang Unit cop friend Marcus, and another dirty, somewhat psychotic cop Franco. Marcus has just been assigned a newbie as a partner; Chris, who just so happens to be the nephew of Jeff; the head of the Homicide division. Of course with such ties, it's the newbie who ends up as the target of the triple nine.Each one gets varying degrees of character development, but due to their being so many characters, it's unsurprising that there might not be as much as you might hope. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike as a sharp leader who's just unhappy with his situation and what he's made to do for the sake of his own son. Kate Winslet hams it up a little bit as Irina, but never quite reaches the amount of intimidation required for the role, and you wonder why Mike doesn't just shoot her in the face and be done with it. Casey Affleck is a little dull as Chris, who's probably the most likable character by accident, having no discernible character beyond being the guy thrown into a world he doesn't entirely understand. Anthony Mackie, however, manages to bring a bit more depth to Marcus than any other character/actor. As the guy tasked with initiating the triple nine, he suffers a strike of conscience at inconvenient times, but is still ultimately a corrupt cop. Aaron Paul does what he does best with Gabe, which is walk around lost with tears welling up the whole time, although in Triple 9, at least his character has good reason. Clifton Collins Jr. plays the semi-psychotic Franco with as much cold heart as is necessary without making the audience wonder how he got passed the police tests in the first place. Woody Harrelson's Jeff is the well- meaning drunkard, who is as close to a show- stealer as Triple 9 gets. Norman Reedus, Gal Gadot, and Michael K. Williams all make small and underdeveloped appearances throughout, as Russel (the only guy on the crew who seems to have his head screwed on), Elena (who exudes bad mother), and Sweet Pea (transvestite pimp who has her ear to the ground) respectively.",Triple 9

They need to get something for the Russians so one of them won't be prosecuted or something like that. Hard to figure it all out. To give them more time to get the job done, they decide to do a Triple 9 (Officer Down) to insure all cops will go to that shooting and leave them to do the heist in peace. I had never heard of the term Triple 9 until this movie. This movie is a disaster from start to finish regardless of the quality of actors within. The big heist is at the end, but before that caper we see a lot of sub plots that have nothing to do with anything, but it is an opportunity to show numerous shooting scenes. Too many of these scenes are shot in the dark and we have no idea who is doing what to who (whom). And for the longest time it was hard to tell who were the good guys and the bad guys.We see Casey Affleck as Chris, a detective, but his role is subservient to everyone else. We don't look to him to be the true lead in this. Then we see Woody Harrelson as a boss detective Jeffery Allen and he is kind of disappointing and we are not sure about him. Oh, his acting is very good, but how he figures into this disaster is beyond me. The very last scene in the movie with him is most confusing. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Michael a bad guy who goes along with the dirty cops because chief Russian Irina (Kate Winslet) has Felix, his son, to insure the heist goes ahead.Too many scenes are very short (and dark) and it's hard to follow any continuity. We figure we'll just wait for that big heist with the Triple 9. The main problem with this movie is that we follow good guys and bad guys and get involved in their personal stuff and are kept wondering when that big heist will come off. The acting is good, but the story isn't well planned out. The story would have been better if we just followed the good guys, but we end up following everyone and that prompts the confusion.Notables: Aaron Paul as Gabe; Clifton Collins, Jr as Detective Rodriquez.

85,alexcomputerkid,A pretty good heist film even if better heist films can be found.,7,26 February 2016,"Sitting through a screening of the heist film Triple 9, the film Heat from 1995 popped into my head immediately. Heat was 1995 and directed by Micheal Mann who had his fair share of good films. Heat has it's fan for so long after so many years due to it's cast and it was well made above everything else. Triple 9 is directed by John Hillcoat who's had a nice quiet career in Hollywood. I've seen many films from many genres not work because they are too similar to something else. Triple 9 is not as good as Heat or another similar heist film The Town from 2009 but Triple 9 works well though even if doesn't have originality.Set in Atlanta, a group of corrupt cops lead and an ex-military leader, who are known for robbing banks and heist gets blackmailed by the Russian mob to perform a difficult heist. All the same, police officer Jeffery Allen (Woody Harrelson) tries to stop this group while really realizing he's in the middle of it.It's getting more cliché to keep putting an all-star cast together but Triple 9 is surely an all-star cast. From Anthony Mackie, Casey Affleck, Arron Paul, Norman Reedus, Chiwetel Ejiofor, you have basically everyone here. Even Kate Winslet is here playing a Russian mob leader Irina Vlaslov even if casting as Winslet as a Russian character makes not a whole lot of sense. It's very hard to make sense of who's and what relationship is to everyone at times but you have too much power not to succeed nor acting is not an issue as expected.Maybe even more why Triple 9 works so well is because of it's action scenes. From the rough kill scenes that surprising how gruesome they are or how rough Atlanta culture is presented to us which is a surprise. It's action scenes has a lot of energy and it's shows John Hillcoat power. A film that really wants to be gritty and it doesn't come short of it. Right from the first act, you know what your getting with Triple 9 and eventually, it all speaks for itself. Much like Pretty in Pink was a cousin film to Some Kind of Wonderful, Triple 9 is the cousin film to Heat. Triple 9 will be forgotten down the road due to I don't see it having a lot of staying power but still nothing to not make note of it. A pretty good heist film even if better heist films can be found.",Triple 9
86,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,"Crooked cops, gangsters, bank robbers and bullets fly through Atlanta in the film Triple 9.",6,23 February 2017,"So last night I decided to make a couple of banana and blueberry smoothies, have a lazy night, and watch the movie Triple 9 with my dad. I remember when this film first came out, and I really wanted to see it. It has an amazing cast, the choreography and camera work look great, and overall it looked like a nice chill out and watch kind of flick. The criminals in this world can do pretty much, whatever they want, because the cops are the biggest criminals. The Israeli/Russian mob in Atlanta of all places, forces these cops to rob banks and do more ruthless acts of crime.The opening to this movie is off the chain. It has a bank-robbing scene, a car chase, a cool shoot out, great action scenes, and cinematography, and it is all done with so much style. This movie really does have amazing looking scenes, and this is a director (John Hillcoat) I was thinking could be a potential to direct a Batman movie.The beginning is awesome, but the movie slowly begins to fade away after that. It's like they blew their entire load in the beginning. Which I understand you want to start things off on a high note. But contain yourself, hold some of that load for later. Damn, that sounds weird. But I'm sure you get the picture. This movie does a real good job of making Atlanta look scary. Woody Harrelson, high off his ass and wearing a werewolf mask in Atlanta is enough to keep me away from Atlanta for a while put it that way. Even though my Granddad lives thereoh well. When I'm not scared anymore, I'll come visit you. Don't blame me, blame Triple 9.Also, I thought it was cool how the movie kept calling them dirty cops, and some of the cast members who play cops look dirty, worn down, and grungy. To keep things simple, Aaron Paul pretty much plays the same character from Breaking Bad. He looks sweaty, grungy, drugged out, and really does portray his character as if he has been through a lot.The cast is my favorite part about this entire movie. But the movies biggest problem for me is I don't know who the protagonist is, and I can't relate to any of the characters. I love Casey Affleck as an actor. On the other hand, his character in this is very bland in my opinion. All I got from his character is that he chews bubble gum to look tough, and he is a newbie on this particular force. It's not that he is a weak actor, because he is not, it's the material that falls a little short. Chiwetel Ejiofor's character is the most well rounded out of everyone.Also, anyone who knows me, knows I love meh some good ol' Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot is starting to become one of my favorite actresses. She is lovely, tough, dedicated, seems very nice in person, and I think she has the potential to go down in film history, as a famous bad ass action female star, like Pam Grier and Sigourney Weaver. Unfortunately, her character is not very well developed, and she really does not have sh*t to do in this movie. I never thought I would say this about her, but you could have taken her out of the movie and it would have not made it any better or worse. This movie I feel like could have been a little bit more original. It feels like so many other movies and television shows we've seen before. Just to name some examples, this movie reminded me of Training Day, The Shield, The Town, and Street Kings.Overall, in my opinion, this film has a convoluted story, too many characters, it could have been more original, it does have great action, great cinematography, and I love this director. But the script could have had more structure to its surface. This is the kind of film where you see it playing on TV one day, you have nothing better to do, and you just watch it while doing something else. That doesn't mean it is terrible, because it is not. It's the kind of movie you can watch while preparing a banana and blueberry smoothie put it that way. I believe the film Triple 9 earns a6 out of 10!Speaking of blowing a load early, I'm gonna blow a load a little early because I'm ready to check out of here. Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",Triple 9
87,kieranbattams,"great performances, not sure about much else..",7,25 February 2016,"Triple 9 follows a gang of criminals, including Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie, the dude from 12 years a slave (can never spell his name), Norman Reedus and more. They rob a bank, but for their next job they have to actually kill a police officer. Anthony Mackie's character though is a slippery snake police officer as well as criminal and they decide to target his new partner, Casey Affleck. Now that premise is an intriguing one and when the film focuses purely on this aspect it becomes an intriguing film. However, there was more than one time that i was bored in this movie.To me among an all star cast Aaron Paul and Anthony Mackie really stood out. But when you have such a big cast with Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet also included, it means some big stars get a lot less screen time. For example i don't really watch the walking dead but i did want to see Norman Reedus show me his acting range, yet he just wasn't in this film long enough to even be credited among the main cast. But the stories of the two before i mentioned in particular were great, Aaron Paul's performance was sort of similar to the way he portrays Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad but it worked and he shined in the role. Kate Winslet though, i don't really know what she was trying to get across with her character but whatever it was didn't really work for me. I'll be honest, i didn't even recognise her at first.So anyway, to wrap it up, Triple 9 isn't bad. The opening of this film is great but then you start to hope the film wraps up soon because it starts to drag and feel longer than it is and when a film makes you feel like that it doesn't make you want to see it again. But when the story kicks in it gives some good twists and turns and it is solid. So whilst this film is far from perfect, it is an okay film and i'd say if you were to catch it on TV then try it out, just don't expect it to go out all guns blazing.",Triple 9
88,taryllsbaker,A Considerable Effort,7,1 March 2016,"Triple 9 is directed by John Hillcoat and packs a star-studded cast; Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet.A group of corrupt cops and criminals blackmailed by the Russian mob manufacture a 999 - police code for ""officer down"" - as a distraction during their biggest and most challenging heist yet.Firstly, I went to see this film specifically for the names attached. Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Woody Harrelson, to name a few. Then there's the director, Hillcoat, who has created some great films in the past; Lawless and The Road. With so much greatness working on this film, I wonder how it felt so messy. The actors did a terrific job, there's a lot of focus on their characters and their backgrounds. I love a film that keeps you guessing who the good guy is, and even by the end you're still not entirely sure. I think the problem is that there's so much going on, often too much at times. The pacing is quick at first but slowly dies down towards the third act, which may leave you questioning the reasons for this. It had a great blend of grittiness and darkness which I loved, but because the story seemed to lack any kind of meaningful substance, it lost me. In some ways, I found this story similar to Villenueve's Sicario, but that dealt with everything so much better and kept me entertained throughout. I'm not speaking about action here, I'm talking about actual drama. Something was missing, I don't quite know what it was yet, but maybe another watch or two may help with understanding the vision the director had.The original score by Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross, Claudia Sarne & Bobby Krlic is pumping with energy. Atticus has always implemented a very atmospheric and distorted sound to his music, which I've come to love and be very fond of. The music works extremely well with the action sequences and dialogue scenes, using sound design as a way of layering and texturing, ultimately completing the overall feel of the film.The editing by Dylan Tichenor is substantial, very simple and easy to follow. Writing by Matt Cook wasn't the greatest, and I'm thinking that's partly why the film didn't completely win me over. Having said that, all of the actors did a splendid job and managed to keep my attention even though I wasn't entirely feeling it.There's one scene I really loved with Casey Affleck's character scoping through a safe house containing secret government files, in a raid shot beautifully with care, capturing the tension at its finest. Among the mess that occurs half way through the film, there's still a few little charms.My verdict; Triple 9 is tense thriller that will keep you on your feet, leaving you with a finale that sustains a sense of unease that will remain for hours after. Although the screenplay doesn't enthral you, it's still an entertaining film. Don't make it an absolute must-watch, though. There are far more superior stories to be told.Triple 9, 7/10.",Triple 9
89,parleon-thedon,Triple 9 - review: What the hell just happened?,4,7 March 2016,"The red band trailer is amazing; When I first saw that trailer, I was game for an intense action thriller (Training Day on crack), however, what I got was...Positives:#1. A through Z (all across the board), all of the actors in this movie delivered convincing performances#2. The opening robbery scene is intense and engaging throughout#3. You know why some of the characters are doing the things that they're doing. Nothing is really explained in full context during the movie; How did some of these characters get involved with the mob? However, I did understand a majority of the characters motivations. When things happened, the characters reacted (no matter how irrational), and I understood where they were coming from.#4. The main crew felt like a close family. We (as an audience) didn't get to spend a lot of time with most of the characters, but during certain scenes you could feel that they were all close to one other.#5. Some deaths linger on. A character may die, you really don't get to know them, but the characters won't let you forget who died.#6. Information is continuously pounded into your brain throughout. I had to remember names, events, and situations. All of the information may make some feel exhausted, but I found it exhilarating.#7. There will be blood, death, and brutality. This movie definitely depicts realistic violence.Negatives:#1. I didn't care who lived or who died; The characters don't let you forget, but if I can't build any sort of relationship with the character, than why would I care.#2. The movie does continuously pound information into your head (which I did like), but it ultimately goes nowhere. By the end of the movie... just throw the info out the window because it ultimately means nothing (WTF!)#3. Unfortunately, this movie uses a ""MacGuffin"" device to further its already absurd plot.#4. The movie starts in a good place, it feeds us supposedly promising information, it goes down a promising path, and than at the end... what the hell! There's no pay off. There's no satisfaction to be had here. By the end of it all, you finally realize that none of that previous crab really matters... at least that's how I felt anyway.#5. This is a by the numbers movie. I wouldn't say that it's totally predicable, but there isn't anything here that you haven't already seen.I really was enjoying this movie from the start, through the middle ( a little), and than the ending happened. Some moments are intense, others are dumb, some make no logical sense, and than the ending is just a complete throwaway.This movie is no Training Day on crack... WTF!... I really had high hopes for this movie. Maybe My exceptions where to high. By the way, everything is spoiled for you if you watch the trailers.Finale Grade: D+",Triple 9

And then there is the denigration of blacks by these Jews and more I won't describe.Great cast. Strange story that is not believable, straight from the opening. A film has to be plausible in order to be accepted by the audience. But how would anyone believe the opening scene and the repercussions of greed which didn't translate into an immediate problem? This film doesn't even bother with making sure that those covering up a crime *wear gloves* when committing crimes in places they shouldn't be.The depiction of Hispanic people in Atlanta was also hilariously way over the top. Religious Jews are disgusting, disgraceful, racist people and Hispanics are all a bunch of ego driven mindless dumb thugs. Whomever was responsible for this mess and clearly anti-Semitic priority should have been tarred and feathered for wasting a good cast of actors.

95,yourfavoritecritic,A Film with No Voice,6,4 March 2021,"Triple 9 is written by Matt Cook and directed by John Hillcoat and in 2016 was met with average reception and barely broke even at the box office. The film stars Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Gal Gadot, Aaron Paul, among many others. Triple 9 tells the story of a corrupt group of law enforcement working for the Russian/Jewish mafia in Atlanta and while planning their next heist come to the conclusion that in order to pull it off they may just have to take out one of their own.Going into Triple 9, I was somewhat looking forward to it, I remember the trailers featured an interesting premise and with a star-studded cast, I figured it would be something to keep an eye on. After seeing it, Triple 9, is a pretty average film held back by the script's woes. With this group of actors and actresses, everyone was quite good, however, no one really stood out and I feel like that may be due to the story's lack of a protagonist. The film never really makes clear who the true main character is in the film, when it started out I thought maybe it was Chiwetel Ejiofor, then I figured it was Anthony Mackie and near the halfway point or so I thought it was Casey Affleck. I'm not sure if Triple 9 lacked direction or was in need of a better script. The film is competently made, the cinematography isn't anything great, however, is serviceable, the sound mixing is pretty good, the movie moves at a good pace, I was never bored and the action is thrilling and suspenseful when it needs to be. It's during the film's downtime when there's no action going on that the plot sort of meanders about as the filmmakers try to tell its story. Which the story is intriguing, albeit nothing original, however, there was enough going on and the premise interesting enough that it should be entertaining however the movie sort of falters due to a lack of a voice. The film bounces around between characters that it doesn't give the audience enough time to get to know them, you sort of get a surface level understanding of each character and even near the end the film is still introducing new details about a character, such as one of the main characters having a substance abuse problem that was never mentioned earlier. I've enjoyed films in the past that don't have a clearcut protagonist, however with Triple 9, it was just not pulled off correctly; the movie desperately needed a voice.Apart from that major gripe with the film that really brings it down, the rest of the movie is mostly fine. I was entertained throughout, the story is gritty and the setting handled well, I felt that the city of Atlanta was a nice backdrop for this film, so much so that it almost felt like a character of its own sometimes. The film also handles its suspenseful moments well, I was on the edge of my seat when I needed to be and I didn't always know where the story was going, although, that might be due in part to the aforementioned lack of a protagonist. Nonetheless, the third act sort of turns into a Tarantino-inspired finale with everyone trying to get back at one another and sure was enjoyable.In closing, Triple 9, is held back by the direction of the script, had there been a consistent voice throughout from one or two characters who push the story along, I really think this film would have faired a lot better. With a star-studded cast like this, you expect more and while the performances are good, nothing about the rest of this film is noteworthy; it's something I see myself forgetting down the line. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining film that I can recommend for a matinee viewing if you have nothing going on; it's not going to be a film that will impress with its numerous action tropes and lack of a voice, however, the movie moves at a brisk enough pace and does a good enough job to keep the intrigue of the viewer. I am giving Triple 9 a 6/10.",Triple 9
96,ryanmark-57919,A Pretty Good Corrupt Cop Movie,8,4 March 2016,"I've been excited for this movie ever since I saw those grimy trailers they released and I have to admit that they definitely delivered on the dark atmosphere that was promised. Nearly everyone in this film is corrupt in some way but it's nice to see that almost all of them have their own reasons for doing what they do. I'm surprised how much hate I've been hearing about this movie since I thought it was actually pretty good. It's certainly not perfect but it has some good action and a decently suspenseful story. I'm also a big fan of John Hillcoat's other films so this was a bit of a no-brainer for me.The story focuses on a group of criminals that includes a few corrupt cops that are being coerced into working for a Russian mob boss. Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet) is bribing one of the criminals, a man named Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to work for her by keeping a close eye on Michael's son, who just so happens to also be Irina's nephew. Their most recent job requires a distraction to keep Atlanta's police officers busy and they decide that a triple nine is what is needed. In other words, they decide a police officer needs to be shot.I have to say that I'm incredibly impressed they were able to get this kind of cast together for this film. All five of the criminals are played by some recognizable names. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, and Clifton Collins Jr. comprise the five man group made up of corrupt officers and even ex-military. All of them have very different personalities with the bulk of them being varying degrees of volatile. These are some truly wretched human beings and the bulk of the movie revolves around their little group. We also get solid performances by Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson and I have to say that I pretty much love everything Harrelson does. Affleck gives us a much more subtle performance but Harrelson just steals every scene he's in with his over the top attitude. Finally, I need to give it up to Kate Winslet as Irina. I didn't even recognize Winslet when I first saw the movie but it's definitely her. She's easily one of the most terrifying people in this film and that's saying a lot considering the lengths some of these people will go to get what they want.Everything about this movie just looks grimy and dirty and it really helps to set the mood for the kind of world we're dropped into. Nothing is sacred here and these people are willing to kill others like its not a big deal at all. We see housing projects and poor neighborhoods that have pretty much turned into havens for crime and even meat factories where the more organized crime takes place. I don't know if Atlanta is actually this bad but I'm now interested to find out.I enjoyed the story for the most part but it felt like there wasn't enough time spent on some of the characters to really give us a good feel for their motivations. This is particularly true for the characters played by Norman Reedus and Anthony Mackie. These guys seemed to be bothered by the acts they were committing but we never really found out why they were committing them like we did for Ejiofor and Winslet. Another problem is that when we do get to find out a character's motivation it's usually revealed to us in an awkward conversation that seems to be a bit forced at times. I actually didn't mind a good deal of the dialogue but it got a lot more awkward when two characters were having an argument or a heartfelt conversation. It didn't bother me too much but it was noticeable in a few scenes.If you're looking for a good corrupt cop movie filled with all kinds of deranged stuff going on then look no further. This film will definitely help to scratch that itch. The dialogue isn't exactly Training Day but it gets the job done and there were only a few scenes that came off as awkward because of it. It's not Shakespeare but I still have to recommend it if you're in the mood for a good dose of suspense.",Triple 9
97,imdb2-5,Jew and Israel hating focus ruins this film,1,25 January 2017,"The opening scene is promising. It's a group of criminals that you find out are police officers are plotting to commit a difficult armed robbery. They decide that in spite of the odds they will go through with the plan. And what you eventually find out is that this film is just all about a group of characters who must obtain a McGuffin, no more no less.We then meet the woman who is calling the shots. The gritty film becomes laughable from there. Kate Winslet, looking nasty and wearing a gold Star of David pendant at least as large as a hockey puck is introduced, right after her two non-speaking thugs with cool haircuts and huge skull cap yarmulkas escort our black protagonist into the house. His half black son is being raised Jewish and also has a huge skull cap yarmulka on his head. Apparently all of this Russian mob also is connected with Israel. What did this have to do with the movie at all? At that point I could only wonder whether the film received financing from a middle east arab country or someone with a HUGE ax to grind with religious Jewish people and Israel. And that theme continues throughout the movie and right up front.There is nothing new as you move along. It's the same heavy handed message that there is no honor among thieves and criminals. I won't give away the ending. It's no big reveal you'll guess part of the explosive climax which doesn't make much sense if the characters are consistent with how they are presented. This is such a colossal waste of talent. A cast whose names are on some of the most well known and revered films of the past decade and the end result will only be memorable for how far out of the way the director goes to remind everyone that the most horrible criminal animals in this film are these reviled religious Jewish Israeli mobsters. Forgettable rubbish.",Triple 9
98,paulmcuomo,"I'm so sorry, but this film just dropped the damn ball!",5,19 February 2016,"First things to say: the cast is really, REALLY good. Just the names alone can get me into a movie theatre, but they also hinder the movie in ways I'll soon discuss. I've seen one reviewer here compare the movie to Se7en, whereas I think its closer to movies like Before The Devil Knows You're Dead and Crash: both ensemble films that feature no concrete lead, and are bleak and very relentless in their bleakness. The plot of this movie is that a group of criminals consisting of corrupt security personal and cops are blackmailed by a Russian mob leader's wife into committing a crime to get him released from prison. In order to pull off said crime, the criminals decide to commit a 999 - the titular Triple 9 - and kill a police officer on the other side of town while they commit the robbery. The story then follows the officer in question, Chris Allen, the criminals led by Michael Belmont, and the detectives investigating the plot as led by Jeff Allen - Chris' uncle.Good points - the cast is great, and the cinematography and action are both perfect for what this movie needs. The film looks the right balance between well put together and dirty in its set-up and feel - you feel in the action, but the action is captivating that you feel like a joyful observer. The action scenes are very well handled, and director John Hillcoat is great with all of choices of camera angles; we see all the important parts of the action scene, so the audience can enjoy the tension and pace of them.But NOW to the big problems with this movie. Firstly, it is not a movie with a good narrative flow, especially after Kate Winslet's character becomes an active catalyst in the plot; one plot decision that makes little sense is that Irina (Winslet) decides to get Belmont (Chwetel Ejoifor) to partake in a tough job that requires a big crew by murdering a crew member of his. When it's further revealed that she is the aunt of Belmont's son and has him already, that makes this senseless act even more illogical, as surely THAT is leverage enough? Other narrative decisions, like the Mexican cartels that show up and then disappear without a valid reason - except for the Triple 9 that honestly could be done by anyone, hell, even one of the corrupt cops could've done it themselves - or the wasting of very potential set pieces, like the elevator at the end of the film, that could've been good. And an ending scene that feels abrupt, cut off, and like it was not meant to end there, but just did.Speaking of the cast, specifically Winslet, I have to comment on her performance first. She plays the leader of the Russian mob, and whilst she is certainly a talented actress, she is NOT the physical fit for this role, as she feels immensely unintimidating for a reason I can't quite place, but just feel. It's certainly the weakest performance in the main cast, with Woody Harrelson as the best, playing the most likable, awesome character in the film who I just love - good old Jeff, who solves problems, protects those he cares about, and has a cynical, cool humour about him. The criminals are well acted, but the problem is that none of them are particularly different to each other; all of them, essentially, are terrible people with a personal issue that they are deal with, but are just terrible people at the end of the day. They are the kind of both who are hard to distinguish; you have two brothers, played by Aaron Paul and Norman Reedus, two black men with similar sounding names and appearance, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mike and Anthony Mackay as Mark, and Clifton Collins Jr. who is the most different visually, but also not really different enough as he's just bad like the rest of them. They are the kind of characters that if played by B-name actors I wouldn't remember, which is not a good thing.This is not a bad movie - I just really, REALLY wanted it to be better. I certainly didn't hate it, I just didn't like it like I wanted.",Triple 9

So I was ready to really like this one, and given the all-star cast, a slam dunk for sure. Wow, was I disappointed! As many commenters have noted, these crooked cops are involved in the Russian mob and we're given no reason why these police officers are doing what they do. Just hinting at ""money"" or greed is not enough. Who are these people and how did they end up in this crazy situation? Sadly, the writer and director doesn't think those questions are important. So we're immersed in what I call ""cop porn"" where we cut out any back story or context and just cut to ""the good parts"" But in this case, without the back story, we don't care about any of the characters or what's transpiring on the screen. So a lengthy (and preposterous) shootout and chase in a gang-infested Atlanta housing development has no weight for us. It's like watching a bad video game.

104,mattbaxter72,"Well, that was certainly a movie that I watched",5,21 February 2016,"All the signs were good for this movie. I like heist movies, and I couldn't imagine being bored by one, at least. I kind of liked the director's previous movie, Lawless, though it wasn't without flaws. But most of all, there's that cast: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Daryll off of The Walking Dead, that guy from Breaking Bad, Clifton Collins Jr sleazing it up, Woody Harrelson hamming it up, and Kate Winslet vamping it up. Here's a note for any would-be directors out there: if you manage to get a stellar cast, you might want to try giving them something to do. Here, everyone gets exactly one characteristic, so Ejiofor is mopey, Mackie is angry, Collins is sleazy (obviously) and Woody Harrelson is off in his own little world, cheerfully ignoring everyone else. None of them gets time to really develop a character, and because there are so many people competing for screen time, none of them even gets that long to do his thing before we're off to someone else. The editing is choppy, and when Winslet isn't on screen, most of the movie consists of men growling incomprehensibly at each other. The heist scenes are well-executed, but the linking scenes are insufferably dull.That problem isn't helped by some baffling narrative choices. Norman Reedus is an effortlessly charismatic screen presence, but all his scenes here are shot inside vehicles. I'm not joking - I can't remember if he even gets to stand up. And then there's poor old Casey Affleck, a dreary bore who's inexplicably made the centre of attention instead of much more interesting actors. Come to think of it, that was my main complaint about Lawless, too, that the action concentrated on the most boring character.Triple Nine isn't hateful, and it isn't hopeless. The heist scenes do work well, and Vampy Winslet is fun, but there's way too much gunk to plough through in order to reach the good bits.",Triple 9
105,RustyShacklefordd,One of the Most Disappointing Films of the Year,4,12 April 2016,"This film had so much going for it. John Hillcoat is in my opinion a pretty underrated director. It has an excellent cast and I love gritty crime thrillers such as this. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.First off, John Hillcoat does do a great job as far as creating atmosphere and environment go. He does an excellent job of creating a dark and gritty urban atmosphere and mood right from the start of the film. The cast also does a really good job given what material they have to work with. The action scene also are pretty well done.That's about where the positives end. The big issue with this film that keeps it from working is it's incredibly shallow plot and script. The plot at first glance seems really simple, but it's executed in such a way where it quickly becomes convoluted mess. This is because the film follows several characters all of which have little-to-no development at all and gives us nothing to invest in. It also doesn't help that the plot is hitting all too familiar beats to the genre which only reminds you that you've seen this film done before and much better.I wasn't expecting the next Training Day, but this film should have been a lot better considering the talent that was involved which just makes it all the more disappointing. Hillcoat and the cast try their best to work with what they are given, but there's only so much they can do when working with a script and story this weak. If you are really interested in this film, I recommend the Schwazeneger flick Sabotage from a few years ago that tackles this kind genre much better.",Triple 9

110,brendandevere,Cops and Robbers.,8,11 March 2016,"What immediately comes to mind after watching 'Triple 9' is the Michael Mann epic crime drama, 'Heat'. Mann's criminal masterpiece has long been considered the benchmark of such films in this genre and Hillcoat's attempt to bring a similar experience to the screen can be seen as a reflection of this mans ambitious talents. It is a travesty that productions like these are made all too infrequently. They instantly capture the imagination of the audience and open up so many brilliant narratives and plot lines. So much can be created with the characters and how they integrate with each other. 'Triple 9' is not up to the same level as 'Heat' in terms of its overall impact but it is still able to deliver a powerful punch for those viewers that enjoy being fully immersed in the world of 'cops and robbers'. Even with a poor marketing campaign, 'Triple 9' is a tantalising film to engage.John Hillcoat (The Proposition, Lawless) is a very popular Director and one that can be easily identified by the art that he creates. Always exploring the relationships of his characters in male dominated turbulent settings, he accompanies his direction with gritty painful scripts and brooding sombre scores that echo through a narrative that consumes the audience. Hillcoat has played around with the time-lines of his stories, placing them in the near future (The Road) and the recent past (Lawless). It was only going to be a matter of time before he was going to place one of his films squarely in the present. Employing his tried and tested techniques from past productions, Hillcoat churns out another enthralling and addictive drama. Matt cook is credited with writing this crime tale. Cook's story is set to a formula that has been explored before but it still works, building up to an unexpected climax that will keep the audience interested. A question can be asked about the absence of Australian musician and writer, Nick Cave. Has his non involvement affected the quality of the narrative? Cave has been the scripted inspiration behind Hillcoat's last two productions, with both having that real dark, raw edge but Cook has been able to compensate nicely. 'Triple 9' still has an eerie atmosphere boiling away underneath the surface.John Hillcoat has put together a stellar cast to drive his film and it begins with a bang as we are all thrust straight into the middle of a bank robbery in the city of Atlanta. After a greedy mistake is made by one of the bandits, the true identity of these criminals is revealed that sets the tone for the entire movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Michael Atwood, an ex military veteran that is up to his eyeballs in criminal activity. His crew, which includes Anthony Mackie as Marcus Belmont is made up of Atlanta's finest from the police department and like Atwood himself, army veterans. 'Triple 9' refers to the police code for 'officer down' and it is this exact incident that these bandits are relying on to do one last job for the dangerous Russian mob that is run by Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet). On the other side of the fence are two tough cops. One is a hard nosed, unconventional leading detective, Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) and the other is his nephew, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), who is more of your idealistic, 'wants to make a difference' lawman. Chris rubs a few of his colleagues up the wrong way by asserting his authority on the rough streets of Atlanta and it soon becomes apparent that he is the one that is the target of this lawless crew.With so many great actors, we could have seen a jostling for top billing but each plays their roles professionally. Woody Harrelson stands out as the experienced commanding detective that has perhaps spent too long fighting the scum on the mean streets. His tactics are borderline criminal but he is a realist and tough, knowing exactly how his world works. Casey Affleck is solid in his performance as is Ejiofor but it is again the extraordinary talent of Kate Winslet that shines through, adding another element to a male dominated story. This modern day great can do about anything and playing a Russian mob boss is just a feather in her cap. Throw in Gal Gadot as Winslet's sister and Teresa Palmer as Affleck's wife and the magnitude of the cast becomes obvious.'Triple 9' won't be for everyone but it will excite the loyal audience. It paints a gruesome picture of life on some very mean and real streets in Georgia.

Michael is stealing valuable information from banks and government locations in order to free Irina's husband who is held prisoner in Europe. This is literally just one of the many subplots of this film, but mostly the main point. Michael works with his best friend Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) and his ex-cop brother Gabe (Aaron Paul). The bring in two dirty cops to help them with a heist which includes Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) a street detective and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr) a homicide detective.

The crew has one last heist that they need to pull off and decide to do a Triple 9 which means that a cop has been killed and all forces rush to that area leaving the other areas of the city aka the heist to have more time to be successful. They decide to kill Chris, but Marcus starts to have some doubts. The movie is predictable. I know it seems like I stated a lot of what the movie is, but this is just the tip of it all there's a lot of twists to it that are easily seen. The movie actually slows down quite a bit in the middle. The characters go back and forth on the same kind of subjects and it seems like it could have been edited down. One major problem for me is the fact that there isn't a strong main character. Yes we follow Chris, but we don't know much about him.

119,Sickpuppy365,An ALL out action crime thriller,7,27 October 2020,"Here's the thing... You take 9 or 10 High-caliber actors, stick them together in a pretty run-of-the-mill action heist flick, and everyone expects it to be another Oscar sweep with the big brooms... That does happen sometimes I suppose... What we got this time however was just an exciting, well-acted run-of-the-mill action heist flick. Not perfect by a long-shot, but a solid almost 2 hours of entertainment.
This thing was non-stop action, loosely interspersed with moments of smoldering intensity, and barely enough exposition from a couple of main characters, to drag you by the wrist down the cobble-stone path of a plot...
The acting is superb, as would be expected. It's effortless to imagine that all these characters are intertwined, or have known each other for years. Quality stuff... The movie has a fitting dark and gritty tone, and you almost feel relief when night turns to day, or indoors turns to outdoors.
The camera-work is clean, even in the car-chase or walking/running scenes the shaky-shake isn't too bad. There is some fairly original gun-play too amidst the general melee that seems to be always going on.
Chiwetel calls all the shots, Casey chews ALL the gum, Gal's legs go ALL the way up, Woody drinks ALL the booze, Kate uses ALL the peroxide, Anthony smokes ALL the Black & Milds, and Aaron does ALL the remaining drugs... This is an ALL out kind 'a movie, and I had ALL the fun watching it.",Triple 9
120,pelhamc,Half-baked Hybrid Makes No Sense,1,11 September 2016,"Part heist picture, part mystery, Triple 9 delivers disappointment. The real mystery was what the hell was going on. There were too many characters and those characters were underdeveloped and unnecessary, with unresolved, interlocking backstories. An ensemble cast was wasted on this turkey.It's Crash meets Heat. It's Antoine Fuqua meets a Nicholas Cage feature. In creating a world with rules of its own, Triple 9 fails. It wasn't realistic. The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia, standing in as a random big city. The only thing Southern about it was the accents of some of the characters. Other characters have no trace of an accent. The antagonists were supposed to be Jewish, but were called ""Russian"" in an apparent effort to dance around the implications of the characterization. The Russian accents were drawled out with sinister impression, rather than naturally expressing thoughts. I got shades of the racist stock ""Oriental"" character from Hollywood's yesteryear. The ATL isn't exactly a Russian Jew capital. The generation of Russian Jews who came over in the '80s and '90s were Sovietized away from religion. They wouldn't be dressed like religious Jews, with yarmulkes and black suits, like the goons in Triple 9. Mexican gang members wouldn't dressed like Pancho Villa. Kate Winslet (Titanic, The Reader) is the gang leader bound to the protagonist by the child of a mixed marriage. In real life, a girl brought a date from another race to a Russian-speaking club in South Brooklyn and they beat the hell out of him. Race relations were a theme, though for some reason the cliché interracial cop buddy trope had the white partner with a Hitler haircut. Why? Major plot points were changed on a dime without explanation or apparent purpose. The protagonist first comes off as a cop. Then it is revealed that he is a civilian working with dirty cops. It doesn't tell you what his job is or how he came to be partners with them. The premise was flawed. The characters are forced into crime and the pockets of the FSU femme fatales by way of extortion. If someone is going to whore out their badge, that means they're dishonest. Why would a dishonest public official just not simply take a bribe? They would. It would make more sense than an elaborate blackmail scheme. The Russian crime wave seems to be more evident in popular entertainment rather than in news reports. They laid a real egg with this one and it's not golden. Or an egg.",Triple 9

124,feelinesound,"Thrilling action and brilliantly shot, I just really wished I could care more about the characters",7,8 May 2016,"This is action done properly, and it's absolutely packed dense with it, the adrenaline level rarely dipping below 100% throughout. And I suppose that's what the producers wanted, because it seems like most of the character development scenes were left on the cutting room floor, which is a real shame because without that it's pretty hard to care about neither cops nor robbers enough to make the stakes high enough and the action as emotionally gripping as it could be.As it is, despite a pretty fantastic cast (Aaron Paul, Anthony Mackie and Woody Harrelson in particular somehow manage to impress despite being given almost nothing to work with) in what should be an intelligent ensemble action flick in the mold of Heat, Ronin and The Departed - but grittier than any of those three - it becomes at some point pretty hard to feel anxious about anything other than the popcorn you're crushing with such a furious adrenaline rush between you're teeth, and least of all about the fates of these poorly fleshed-out and almost entirely despicable characters. Which isn't to say that it's not an enjoyable watch - on the contrary. It's actually both a very entertaining and quite well-made movie, as well as being a pretty massive wasted opportunity at the same time. With as little as 20 additional minutes to set up back stories for these people and make them appear somewhat human this could have been one of the best action films of the decade, instead it's one we'll probably forget within a decade.",Triple 9
125,D-Gal,What was the point?,4,30 May 2016,"A couple of months ago I saw the teaser trailer to this movie and thought it could be absolutely amazing! I just got around to watching it, and to say the least, I was pretty disappointed. The list of actors cast for this movie was amazing, and the potential that could've been is astonishing (if the screenplay was much better). It's a great shame that so many well known names were put to waste. It started very strong, and was a potential 9/10 rating! It was running at a steady pace and the characters seemed like they could very well be likable characters. As the story progressed, my rating for this movie was dropping one notch at a time..The connections between the characters were confusing and very uninteresting, and the characters themselves were beyond paper-thin. There wasn't a single character that demanded the utmost attention from the viewer. Also, because we as members of the audience learned little to no details of the connections between these individuals and the full reason behind their motives, all connections felt seemingly pointless and out of place. I found myself checking the run-time a lot, hoping that around the three-quarter mark there'd be an epic twist and it'd give the film some flavor; it never came... As soon as the credits came, I was totally and utterly gob-smacked. I sat there in awe, and said to myself out loud ""Really? Are you kidding me? That's it? Wow..""What was the point of this film? Maybe it made sense the people/person who wrote it, but to me? I had little to no clue what was happening. It was going this way.. it was going that way.. Nope, changed direction again.. Okay, there's a new character. Who is that? Oh you're not going to tell us who it is and what their connection is? Okay, then.. The acting was excellent. That being said, that's the only positive I can find to express this film as a whole. I look forward to never watching this film again. Ever.There's my biggest disappointment for 2016. 4/10.

127,mmjnr10,One of the Best Crime Action Drama Movies Ever made!,9,8 October 2016,I decided to write this review since some people decided to make a mockery of this hidden gem for some unknown reason but known however to myself!! Anyways I had this movie in BluRay copy for nearly five months and never thought of watching it because of the low IMDb and user review ratings which mostly claim at a boring badly done crime drama and since I am a guy who has seen it all from The Godfather all the way through Once Upon a time in America all the way to Training Day and The Town!! I consider myself a professional movie critic not just a basic movie watcher and I do have my own movie critic blog which is quite popular from where I come from anyways enough with the nonsense and let's talk the movie without giving any spoilers.. Let's start by deciding what is the most Important and fundamental ingredient that makes a good movie I say it is the story itself and how it is told then comes the acting and the stars that and the directing that can bring it to life in style!! Well here we have all of them starting with a compelling and strong story line with enough twists and turns that if I just say out loud to anyone I'm sure of engaging him for a good 15 minutes or more from start to finish then we have the cast which I believe everyone has agreed that it's an excellent very well picked cast with big surprise appearances by Kate Winslet and Gal Gadot and less surprising but extremely impressive by Woody Harelson who gave one of the best performances of his entire exceptional career!! So where is the problem there?!! What are people expecting from a good Crime Action Drama?!! The action was top notch and well thought of and the drama was exceptional with a dark and heavy feel throughout matched by heavy incidents which is what make this movie so great!! Some crime movies just have that heavy dark feel without substance or something serious going and that to me is a mediocre movie that is trying so hard to cover up a lame story line with sound and Directorial effects to confuse the audience and give a weight to the movie that does not fit it but in this one its totally the opposite everything is well balanced and as I said and keep saying the story line is that good which makes everything falls into pieces.. Go watch it folks and be fair to yourselves and judge the movie for what it is not what has offended you!!!!!,Triple 9

In my opinion, this film is brilliant enough to wrap a crime thriller with lots of characters in it. I've watched enough action films, and this one is enough to meet my expectations in action films. The whole film feels very tense, with good action scenes, an interesting plot (especially the interconnections between the characters), and a little touch of interesting drama. Really a fantastic ride!I like this film, but it still divides the screenplay between the characters quite evenly, even though the consequence is that each character can't be digged deeper into its characterization because of the problem of the screentime that focuses on the same core story. Even so, the story can treat it all. It's like an action film with a captivating adventure. All of the cast here are brilliant in playing their respective roles, thank goodness that getting lots of classy actors can help the plot and characters come alive. Scoring here is very important, because throughout the film, the scoring helps to feel the tension throughout the film. Not only scoring tho, but the cinematography here also makes tense with a typical take action but still can be enjoyed.",Triple 9

That's not to say it isn't good. The story twists and turns the whole way through. The shootouts are about as good as anything I've seen in any movie, one standout scene is a police raid on a suspect in the middle of a housing project... and he turns out to be quite the drug cartel soldier.The problem with this movie is that it takes on far too much. There are too many threads and too many characters. Nobody in the movie really gets enough screen time to establish themselves as a character properly. The result is a mess, frankly. It's got a plot line for a tight, single-season TV series, not a movie.There's also no real action climax to the whole thing. It twists, it turns, it's got doublecross after doublecross and various plans going wrong, and it does these things brilliantly. But it all happens at the same pace throughout instead of building up.

145,jhnachos,"""Nothing is Black and White""",8,9 July 2017,"Triple 9 is a movie that has mostly been forgotten. It did poor at the box office, got mixed reviews and didn't do enough to get major attention, but this is one the critics were a bit too harsh on. Triple 9 is by no means a masterpiece, but it is none the less thrilling, suspenseful and mostly well done. The film is set in Atlanta where a group of criminals attempts to pull of a huge heist and part of that heist is getting the police to all be drawn to a code 999, officer down. The plot itself is rather interesting and is a main reason for keeping viewer attention and interest to the story. The cast is great all around. Woody Harrelson might come off as a bit over the top, but he was none the less entertaining. The cast does a great job even with the script being just, fine. It isn't an awful script, but there issues with pacing that stand out, but they aren't enough to truly affect the scenes that transpire throughout. The direction is pretty great for the whole film. All action scenes are very well done with a ton of suspense and the violence is very much a strong addition. The violence may be too much for some, but I thought it was done very well. The editing during these action scenes was pretty excellent, the opening heist was my favorite part of the movie and that was helped by the solid editing and crisp direction. The editing during dialogue scenes was not as good, but also not enough to take me out of the movie. Although some scenes might not be as necessary as other's nothing felt severely out of a place. If the actions scenes weren't as excellent as they are these issues might stand out more.Overall, Triple 9 is no Ocean's Eleven or Reservoir Dogs, but is a great film, with several great moments of tense action, strong performances and solid direction. There are issues with the script and editing during dialogue scenes wasn't the best, but in the end I would be lying if I said I didn't think Triple 9 was a great movie that I think got less praise than it deserved.

148,wyrzykowskikajetan,A flawed yet still gripping tale about dirty cops,7,30 March 2016,"The Australian director John Hillcoat opens the hellish gates right in the beginning sequence of Triple 9 and till the very end, the saturnine world of crooked cops is consecutively examined. Putting some minor flaws of the plot and execution aside, this film delivers shivers down the spine and ends up being a truly blood-curdling experience.Triple 9's plot line is a quite complicated puzzle to put together – five well-trained ex-mercenaries and cops do a bank heist for the Russian mafia. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned and they are forced to do another job, which includes getting their hands even dirtier. Eventually, they begin to struggle with the time and fellow cops, who are after them.As the thriller genre's father, Alfred Hitchcock claimed – film should start with an earthquake. Hillcoat pays attention to the words of the master and starts off with some heavy artillery – the bank heist sequence is the absolutely top-notch directing. This solid and entertaining beginning sets the pace and the unsettling atmosphere throughout the entire film. The ubiquitous dreariness mixed with unbearable tension is a tribute to classic films like Mystic River and Heat, but we may find some inspirations drawn from Traffic, Sicario and End of Watch too.What's more, the soundtrack by Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Bobby Krlic boosts the cinematic experience too. The heavy electronics, pulsating in the most dynamic tracks, flows into a haunting cacophony of voices and ominous strings in more dramatic scenes, keeping the vibe of Matrix's soundtrack, Gone Girl, Mad Max: Fury Road on one hand, but going towards Jóhann Jóhannsson's and Dan Romer's pieces too on the other. But don't get the illusion that Hillcoat and his team just copies others' works – he's well versed with the genre, moving around with grace and finding his own gripping style.Unfortunately, Hillcoat's work is far from being flawless. His star-studded cast was supposed to be the solid ground, because let's be honest – Kate Winslet, Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Woody Harrelson, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul and even Michael K. Williams in the most hilarious appearance in his career – this is a dream team to work with for every filmmaker in Hollywood. Yet, this ensemble causes these talented actors to have limited time on screen and only few of them really grasps the essence of their characters. We get truly convincing performances put by Ejiofor and Affleck, a simpleton-drunkard by Harrelson and some straightforward letdowns by Winslet and Paul. This is a pack of dogs let loose and unfortunately, it's all Hillcoat's fault.What's more, Hillcoat struggles with the meandering script. The plethora of characters emerging on the screen seems to be overwhelming to the director sometimes, whose apparent love for action-packed scenes doesn't go along with the psychological aspect of the film. The Australian director manages to dig into the depraved world of corruption and abominable crimes, yet he only scratches the surface, mainly by using shocking imagery and violence. He sometimes loses the depth, but covers it up with brilliantly crafted action.Triple 9 will surely satisfy the ardent fans of cop dramas. Those, who enjoyed End of Watch, True Detective, the remake of Miami Vice or any other gruesome and realistic thriller, should not hesitate and watch Hillcoat's film. Despite its flaws, we don't get many such compelling films anyway these days.",Triple 9

This is usually the director's headache when they cast such an amazing 'Crew'. I'm not biggie in watching trailers, when this came out, I stopped in middle and said to myself when it comes out, it's a definite watch. (Why can't trailers be short and sweet and leave the rest to imagination now days?) From the get go itself your bond to be engrossed in the movie. Not a second did I feel like I should get off the couch (It's a different story when you feel good in the washroom after).

The action is good the story has grit, strong performances and a point. SO many Police movies have similarities but there is a bit of all sorts in here and I really think it's worth a watch. It has uses drama like The Equalizer in that it's required and not over used, the characters don't have super powers and are not immune from pain. The story hints at political themes and shows life in the underworld much like it is, with little remorse, no easy way out and a greedier person just ready to come along.

152,manuelwinchester,Big-cast disaster,4,17 August 2016,"Triple 9 (999) is a police code which is heard when an officer falls down. Triple 9, the film, is about pretty much something similar. A group of infamous thieves, including two corrupted cops, is preparing for a big job which entails an officer's death. The plot sounds passable, but Triple 9 has so many wrong elements. I don't know what was the director, John Hillcoat (''The Road'',''Lawless''), thinking, but the whole movie looks like an extemporaneous effort. The main problem lies with the characters. They are so uninteresting that the audience has no reason to care or be intrigued by them. Such a great, strong cast with numerous big actors (Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Winslet) ends up to such a poor constructed plot. Oh, and when you have Gal Gadot, make sure you use her, don't just lock her away. Even the action and the few shocking scenes are so vapid due to their sappy characters. In a crime action film, the plot and the characters are the only weapons, considering that you don't have Michael Bay's budget at your disposal. Triple 9 is so lazily built and has nothing to show, nothing interesting or fresh to exhibit.

Then slows to establish characters, and then desperately tries to speed up again but fails. It just kinda meanders to a stop rather than to an end.The star studded line-up almost seemed to hold it back. It was as though all the A-listers demanded at least 15 minutes of screen time each, and the end result was lots of scenes which should have ended up on the editing room floor, but didn't.A story and a cast with tonnes of potential, poorly executed.",Triple 9

They are always red, not pinkish. Its rather shot with high iso setting, when needed, what can be seen on its sometimes high grainyness. Its dark but always extremely well photographed. Very raw. The colours are punchy, everything is as Kodak as it can get with digital. Very nice perscpectives, good cutting. Its pure eye candy. There is no bluring or denoizing going on. When it gets grainy there is also always a lighter part in the picture composition that keeps everything in balance. High contrasted. The photography perfectly matches the story and the acting. Its a dark thriller where reality bites, set in a apocalyptic part of our society. Some flaws, like some overacting here and there but all in all a solid masterpiece.",Triple 9

I thought using a 999 to carry out a heist was unique, unfortunately the way they told the story was bland and borderline boring. The dialogue between characters was not well written, and the location of the final heist was not well selected. Why the writers chose to place the item of interest at DHS was a head scratcher. Then on top of that there were practically no security at DHS when they got there. It made for a boring finale.The movie itself is extremely watchable but this movie could have easily been a great one.

Sadly this movie jumps from scene to scene and that disjointed feeling lasts until the end. There is a story and there is some sense to it but it just doesn't gel as a movie.The police are depicted as bumbling, incompetent and corrupt but this is so exaggerated (I hope!) that it means there is no sense of realism whatsoever. The movie doesn't build empathy with any of the characters or even tell you much about them, in any case virtually all of them are unpleasant, so I was left not really caring what happened to any of them.

166,WestBridgeFilm,Do NOT believe ANY mainstream CRITIC REVIEW of this film!,8,1 May 2016,"There is something seriously amiss about the bad reviews of this film! Okay, maybe I'm just 'completely crazy'. It's entirely possible. While it's not like it's the greatest film crime drama/ heist film to ever hit American cinema, for this film to receive the reviews it's getting is down right disgusting to me! (More so then any violence ever depicted in this movie).In fact, there is a scene in the movie where one of the characters says something to the effect...""You are targeted!"". Well that's exactly how I feel critics and film snobs are reviewing this movie. First of all, I'm a movie lover (first) of ALL genres, AND I've actually written an indie $25 million dollar movie that appeared on thousands of screens, not to gloat but just to give you some perspective. And my movie was ripped by critics and film snobs alike too.(And that ripping was deserved!),just to show you some humility, but these reviews are not just when it comes to this film.But think about it for a second...what IS exactly a ""professional critic"" OR ""film snob"" critic? For starters, neither have ever written/directed/starred/ or produced a film that was any good OR cost millions of dollars of someone's money. EVER! So f' them all to begin with. A bunch of hack nobodies that can't actually create anything themselves, with the exception of garnering some popularity for being ""said critic"". Like seriously...losers if you ask me. If they're so good at evaluating movies. Why don't they go out and smash grab a couple of ten million dollars or so and actually PRODUCE something besides a review of another's work?! But I was a FILM LOVER, waaaaaay before I got into the biz...and this crime film was very very good! The first thing that caught my eye, was that the acting performances were stellar. I've never seen Casey Affleck so good, and I've never EVER seen Kate Winslet so diabolical OR as 'sexy' before this film. (I didn't know she had in it her for both so kudos to her! And as long as we are talking ""cinema snobs"", I actually read a ""critic review"" that discussed how bad Winslet's 'Russian Accent"" was in this film. Really? We are now going to rip an ""Academy Award"" winning actress for her accent in a ""crime drama"" movie that was meant for just pure entertainment of the genre and is not supposed to be fing Citizen Goddamn Kane or Gone with the fing Wind? Well, yes we will apparently so exactly that. As if we can ALL do it better.I LOVED Woody Haralson's character in this film. Yeah, we've seen bits and pieces of this type of character from him in the past, but he's great in this! Okay, yes, Norman Reedus is a little bit ""Daryl"", and yes, Aaron Paul is a little bit ""Jessie Pinkton"" (Do we NOT still all love those characters???), they are still very very good in this movie too! And I have to admit, Even though I've seen them, I'm not as familiar with Chiwetel Ejiofor or Anthony Mackie, BUT I AM NOW....and will be following for sure in the future..both will be house hold names in a few years.And Clifton Collins Jr.....I almost didn't recognize him...but a great actor that's been around for YEARS...and will also probably finally be a household name within a few as well. I hated him in this movie...""as a character""...and that's exactly how we were supposed to feel! And what about the giant set of balls (no pun intended when you see the film)of actor ""Michael Kenneth Williams"" for his role of ""Sweet Pea""! Come on, now! Okay, now let's talk about ""crime/drama/heist movie/ plot. The plot is a bit different than most heist films too. It trends on the darker side, like a Reservoir Dogs type film, but it's NOT trying to be Reservoir Dogs either. It's more of a 'Departed, meets ""Reservoir Dogs"", meets 'Training Day' type movie...without all the self importance! Now as for the Director/Writer team of John Hillcoat & Matt Cook, I'm honestly not that familiar with either, although I really did like Hillcoats ""The Road"", but I'm looking out for their future stuff now too because of this film. Great directing and writing.Oh, and btw, what big studio film put this out??? NONE. Is your answer. It's purely an bigger budgeted 'indie film"" produced by (count them) 21 PRODUCERS! That either put their heart, blood, sweat, money..or....made a phone call or lend-ed their name for half a sec. (it's Hollywood, people, that's how indies get done sometimes)to get this sucker made.And yet it's ripped by ""Hollywood Critics"" and ""Film snobs"" alike.My point is, if you like a really good, non academy award winning, non film snob, non big budget, non big studio, non Hollywood machine, non anything that is popular (beside the cast) type crime film....SEE THIS MOVIE...it's worth your $15 at the box office, it's worth your $10 to own, it's worth you're $6.95 to rent/stream in HD, it's worth your $1 at Redbox.

With nods to Reservoir Dogs and TV's The Shield, the pace and plot made this film worth the effort. Kate Winslet hams it as the Russian Mafia boss, and Woody Harrelson is morphing into a mumbling Marlon. Russian Mafia v street gangs v bad cops v good cops. Lots of violence and collateral damage, not for the squeamish, and shoot outs galore. A very strong cast are given free rein, and even the bit characters are allowed depth of personalities. This is far from the American Dream, and the squalid underbelly of downtown city life is frighteningly real.

The shortest review I could offer is to say it would have been fine as a £3 purchase but it wasn't worth buying at £7.The cast are good (although Kate Winslet seems pretty miscast to me). The script is OK: the plot isn't exactly labyrinthine but it's complicated enough that you don't feel like you're watching dumbed-down Hollywood nonsense, and likewise the dialogue is fairly decent/'realistic', not a sequence of cheesy one-liners and ham-fisted exposition, like all too many action films. The direction/cinematography is atmospheric. The setting (Atlanta) is refreshing, as opposed to the usual LA/NY/Chicago suspects......so on paper there's lots to like. But somehow in practice it doesn't add up to much and my overall feeling was underwhelmed. I'm not really enough of a film scholar to analyse and explain why.All I can say for this really is that if you have a few hours to kill, you like this sort of film and it pops up on TV or on Netflix then it's worth a watch.

When it ended, seemingly 6 3/4 hours after it started, the audience gave a gasp of relief and ran out of the theater like hostages finally freed with only minor injuries.

Cops enter in the room where the baby is laying on the bed, with the intention to arrest the bed guy and in the mean time they just leave the baby lying there even though his/her life is endangered.

To say I was excited to see this film is an understatement. Directed by John Hillcoat, Triple 9 is about a crew of criminals and corrupt cops that have to pull off one last heist and the best way to distract the police is to kill one of there own. For the most part this film delivered. There are three awesome action set pieces that happen in the film. Each time the stakes intensify and things slowly start to fall apart. The corruption and betrayal results in a blood path, with the film doing a great job by never letting a character feel safe. I really liked how the film is mainly focused on our criminals. It makes the scenes with Casey Affleck being the only good cop really intense. Woody Harrelson plays a version of the character from True Detecitve only in this he's x3 the mess. Lastly mentioning the criminals and corrupt cops. Every one does there job really well with Ejiofor and Mackie being the stand out. The cinematography and score is really well done. When people's life is endanger it's extremely intense. If this film would of stuck the landing it would of been a great film instead of just a good film. There are typical cop tropes in the film but it's forgivable. The third act loses a lot of it's momentum and isn't as exciting as the scenes prior to it. The characters left standing and the resolution is a little unsatisfying. At the end of the day the ensemble charges this film forward and solid action makes it an entertaining watch.

I regret watching this movie. I saw a previous movie with Case & Woody where the on screen chemistry was awesome. Seemingly they attempted again but failed miserably. Lastly, a few racist stereo types that didn't fit into the movie but were forced in taking away from the movie.

183,LiamLovesMovies,"Well shot and directed, but lacking any emotional impact...",5,25 February 2016,"The impossibly bleak ""Triple 9"" is directed by John Hillcoat who, in the past, has worked with some pretty sombre material in ultra-hopeless films like ""The Road"". He's also worked with a cast of big-name actors in the western thriller ""Lawless"", something which he of course brings to this star-studded feature as well. The cast here is almost too long to list; reliable performers such as Casey Affleck, a.k.a Batman's brother, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are probably the leads, A- Listers Woody Harrelson and Kate Winslet are given supporting roles, and ""Triple 9"" also features some television icons in the form of Aaron Paul, known for his role as Jesse in ""Breaking Bad"", and Norman Reedus, the almost invincible, crossbow-wielding hero Daryl Dixon from ""The Walking Dead"". The story, which attempts to cover a whole lot of ground, follows a band of criminals, lead by Ejiofor's Michael Belmont, who find themselves under the thumb of the Russian mafia, and are subsequently forced into carrying out increasingly problematic heists. We also meet Chris Allen (Casey Affleck), a rookie cop who finds himself partnered up with rogue officer Marcus Atwood (Anthony Mackie) in the most dangerous precinct in town, and with Belmont's crew needing a good distraction to carry out their latest raid, he finds himself in the unknowingly precarious position of being the target for a 'Triple 9': officer down. If there's one thing that ""Triple 9"" does particularly well, then it's the hostile and crime-infested atmosphere it is able to create throughout its near-two hour runtime. While the movie might be better suited taking place in a Los Angeles or a Boston, it is somewhat refreshing to see a new city get a grisly makeover, and they do a hell of a job. The neon lighting of Atlanta bars and eerie streets of the night lend the film a rather gloomy and ominous gravitas, and the portrayal of the disenfranchised and unruly neighbourhoods is striking, motivated and, most importantly, appears very real. The version of Atlanta presented in this movie feels truly lived in, and you can't help but sympathise with the characters for having to go about their lives in such unstable conditions. No one person in this movie ever seems safe from the cold grip of death that seems to be lurking around the city, and ""Triple 9"" is curious, if only for the mystery of who will survive such a dire situation. Atticus Ross's music is pulsating and biting in the best way, and the David Fincher-collaborator's score not only does a tremendous job of building tension, but also perfectly complements the gritty and unrelenting darkness of the feature. The film, much like the excellent ""Sicario"" from last year, really comes into its own during its set-pieces, and Hillcoat proves himself adept at managing them from the very first sequence of the movie. The highlight though, without a doubt, is a police raid on a gangster's hideout which, set to absolutely no score whatsoever, is exciting, unnerving and the most engaging scene in the entire movie. The strong cast do deserve some credit as well; Chiwetel Ejiofor is actually rather likable as a worn-down criminal forced to do the dirty jobs for the good of his son, even if the relationship between him and his partner Elena (Gal Gadot), which leaves him intimately linked to the Russian mafia, isn't fleshed out whatsoever. Speaking of the Russian mafia, it's quite evident how much fun Kate Winslet has playing the hyper-realised and rather cold mob boss Irina, and even then her exchanges with Ejiofor's Michael feel the most emotionally and narratively impactful. There's a lot going on in ""Triple 9"" and, quite honestly, it's all a bit too much. In prospect, such a huge and well-known cast seems rather tantalising yet, in practice, the film is left in dire need of some focus. We have the crew of modern bandits at the centre of the story, and they are the ones who really hold your interest. It's frustrating then that the movie spends all of its time jumping back and forth, in rather erratic fashion, between them, the Russian mafia, Woody Harrelson's Woody Harrelson type character carrying out a rather fruitless and unnecessary investigation, bent cops played by Mackie and Collins Jr. abusing the system, and Affleck's Chris getting used to some pretty nasty streets. It's too bloated and half of those plot-lines could quite easily be dropped or reworked to make ""Triple 9"" a much more cohesive thriller. This also contributes to the problem of paper-thin characterisation, which is a similar issue to that faced by ""Black Mass"" from last year. We spend so little time with even the main characters that it's hard to care about them or even understand their motivations particularly well. Take Aaron Paul for instance. Besides the fact that he is essentially reprising the role of Jesse Pinkman, to the extent that he even deploys his famous catchphrase 'Bitch' at one point, there is no explanation offered or established as to why he would act in the desperate way he does. Woody Harrelson phones it in with the most typical performance you can imagine from him. Even Casey Affleck is struggling to add anything to the stereotypical role he is given to work with. The problem: everyone is just too far inside their comfort zone and, quite frankly, it gets a little boring. Apart from Ejiofor and perhaps Winslet, I've seen these performances on numerous occasions before. The glue between the set pieces is also quite weak and, with very few characters to feel emotionally invested in, your left waiting for something exciting to come along and pick up the narrative. The film's conclusion is rather unsatisfying and haphazard, tying up the knots in the most by-the-numbers and unoriginal fashion possible. There's a lot of style and probably too much substance, and more than that, it's the substance that we've seen a hundred times before anyway.",Triple 9
184,shmoney,I turned it off with 8 minutes to go,4,10 December 2020,The long stare in the parking lot really did me in. Casey Aflek is a terrible actor. I don't know how he gets roles.,Triple 9
185,isabelladavisallen,Casey Affleck the Gum Chewer,3,18 June 2016,"First off only watch this if you want to see Casey Affleck chewing gum every scene. Honestly, this man chews gum the whole way through the movie. He was chewing gum in bed with his misses. He was chewing gum while drinking a beer, seriously. I legitimately think there were 2 scenes where he was not chewing gum.Also, might i add that this movie made no sense to me at all. Perhaps it was because i lapsed concentration from horrid acting or cliché crap.It is not terribly terrible but it is terrible.3/10 don't watch. Ciao.",Triple 9
186,edohanclasen,Expected a bit more,6,5 July 2018,"The plot and cast of Triple 9 held much potential but did not deliver as expected. The film follows a group of highly skilled criminals that execute action packed heists. The major revelation is that two of these criminals are policemen. Apart from that, the story does not hold much suspense and revelation. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is forced by Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), a criminal kingpin, to do these jobs by threatening Atwood with the safety of his son (not something new). The story unravels as they plan the 'final' heist where, as expected, everything goes wrong. There is some parts of the film which I enjoyed. However, with such an all-star cast, it did not live up to the expectation.",Triple 9

Casey Afleck plays his outsider cop character very well as is becoming customary as he climbs up the chart of best young actors.Honestly the story isn't anything inspirational or transforming and it's a bit violent and gory but if you're a fan of Afleck then it'll deliver.",Triple 9

None of the movies I like ever are.",Triple 9

194,musicfilm-2,Disappointing,4,26 February 2016,"I went into this movie with high expectations, but alas, I was let down. Good actors and a plausible story, but inevitably Triple 9 fails to deliver. There are no characters I could really root for with the possible exception of Casey Affleck (just a little). I found myself yawning several times throughout - it just didn't hold my interest. No real back story so it's hard to fathom what these characters are really all about. Some sexy girls, guys with tattoos and attitude and bad cops. The bank robbery at the beginning was the most exciting part and it's downhill from there. Somehow I didn't buy Kate Winslet as a badass. The best line in the film was Woody Harrelson's reference to the Kosher Nostra - that actually got a few laughs. Don't say you weren't warned.",Triple 9
195,mybanker,Just watch The Departed for the third time.,6,24 May 2016,Don't get me wrong this is a film worth watching- but only if you've seen the departed at least twice. The plot it fairly predictable and there just seems to be too many story lines packed in. It lacks depth and confuses you with where you should direct attention to. The action is decent but it's really nothing we haven't seen before in a well-financed heist film. The individual performances aren't great despite the big names involved but this is no fault of the actors alone. They individually have so little screen time that it's hard to cement any sort of characterisation apart from maybe Ejiofor and Aaron Paul who delivers an excellent performance in the little screen he is given. I really do not know what Kate Winslet was doing in this film. Stream it legally folks.,Triple 9
196,means-derek,like a classic beautiful gem broken,9,3 June 2016,"Movies like this have it much worse than movie like Pirates of the Caribbean and all the Marvel movies due to their gritty and rough nature. This movie is a hidden gem that is scratched but beautiful, hugely full of talent but will never be big due to it not being for everyone. Its unfortunate but this movie really really is good, please give it a watch. Its a real like kind of cop film instead of good guy cop who makes no mistakes and is always doing whats right, its a film where there are grey lines instead of things only being just black and white. There is right and wrong and whats legal, its not mindless entertainment like Fast and Furious(don't get me wrong those films are fun) this movie strikes at your heart in every way you would want to act if bad things happened to you.",Triple 9
197,thomas-arrigoni,Promising but disappointing,3,6 August 2016,"All right, I see you coming ""3/10 he's severe!"" Well, this movie is too contrasted as it first shows you a very promising story with a pretty famous cast but as the film goes you get more and more frustrated...Triple 9 fails to deliver the story, very too often I felt that the acting was poor except for Woody Harrelson, maybe it's because he played True Detective and it reminds me of a great season one of the TV-Series. That said, as the story goes on, you barely understand the links between the characters, neither their true motive. Chiwetel Ejiofor was the most disappointing as to me he really didn't fit in his role, he didn't convince me at all. Kate Winslet was also not fit to be this ruthless Russian mob boss (or wife as we don't understand for sure...). Many scenes are also totally random and makes you feel awkward.There was good parts and good ideas but very not well exploited. Too bad !",Triple 9
198,aamir3230,Wasted my time..One of the Worst movie seen after Knock Knock,1,2 June 2016,"It's Just Awful,disappointing,time wasting,Piece of s***............. How can they put so many Fab. actors in a movie and before the action even start they get Killed by their friends only, that was so unexpected and disappointing........Only thing I liked in the movie was how that Russian B**** was blown into pieces(lol)......It can be said that the efforts of all actors were wasted and I wonder how and why they could have signed such a horrible movie.............. It literally gave me HEADACHE as I waited for something good to be happen till the end.And I know many people went through this.....nothing can be worse than......Actions is limited to what was seen in the trailer nothing new....",Triple 9

Shame on you, Mr. Cook and everyone else involved in this production! I hope Matt Cook never works on this side of the civilized world! This kind of racial hatred has no place here. Other than that, the movie is quite gritty, along with such films as Brooklyn's Finest, End Of Watch, Sabotage, Street Kings. All characters are convincing, actors did well, save for Winslet - grossly miscast, unconvinced acting - just bad overall. Also, this was definitely not Harrelson's best acting. I mean, he was OK at best. Ejiofor, Collins Jr, Reedus, Mackie and Affleck did their usual, it was a pleasure to see Aaron Paul breaking from typecast.",Triple 9
200,erikwt78,Acted Well. Intense Action Scenes. That's it.,6,14 December 2020,"Basically just what most others have said: Great acting, Great action direction but nothing of a plot.As another had said as well: I really wanted to like it but when a movie tries so hard with realism and intensity, the lack of plot is so obviously clear that it becomes (expectedly becomes) a let down.I wish more movies wouldn't just be about retaliation & ""doing a job"" but has more substance and foundation building. Other than that, it was acted & directed well.",Triple 9
201,bodley1982,Disappointed. Could have been so much better.,5,28 November 2016,"With a promising start after a well shot action sequence the film soon starts to lose it's way.With such an array of talented actors I was expecting an engaging story but couldn't have been more wrong.With what could have been an interesting premise for a heist film the rest of the story is poorly constructed and lacks direction.There are too many characters resulting in not enough time to explore and develop each of them. Consequently I was left feeling nothing for any of them and wasn't bothered whether they met their demise or not.The dialogue is equally poor which was apparent despite the calibre of actors on screen. The casting seems bizarre particularly Kate Winslet as the wife of an imprisoned Russian mafia boss. The accent is poor and her role just doesn't work. Having said that the action sequences are well executed exemplified by a set piece midway through the film involving police searching a building. It's slick, gritty and tense. On a par with the freeway sequence from Sicario.The remainder of the film was boring and soon forgotten.",Triple 9

Highly recommend it!",Triple 9
203,omgkaneshere,Not good enough to end as unsatisfyingly as it did.,6,13 December 2020,"I thought it was a fun action-thriller with some mystery wrapped inside of it, but everyone friggin' dies....There is close to no real satisfying ""feel-good"" moment except when Woody kills the last cop left. The way everyone else died was so...unsatisfying. I don't mind it when everyone dies, but that kind of character kill off, at least to me, is reserved for deep, twisting, hard-to-figure-out plots like Tarantino movies.I would have loved it if some of the main characters survived or had some redemption arc, but they all just died....and the movie wasn't too complex. If you're going to kill off such a star studded cast, at least make it interesting...otherwise, just roll with the fun action-thriller where all the cool people live and the plot isn't out of this world.",Triple 9
