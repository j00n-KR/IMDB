0,TheLittleSongbird,Not a film to be hostile towards,8,5 January 2018,"With a high appreciation of the Western genre, the involvement of a talented cast, the generally positive (so far) critical reception and one of 2017's best trailers (to me at least), 'Hostiles' had me completely sold from the get go.Getting back from seeing 'Hostiles' a couple of hours ago (although a 2017 film it was only released in my country today), it on the most part did not disappoint at all. Some may be turned off by the slow pace and the brutality of some scenes. Neither bothered me actually, having gone in to the cinema knowing exactly what to expect from watching the trailer and reading a few reviews that made it clear from the outset that 'Hostiles' was a deliberate and uncompromising sort of film. Yes 'Hostiles' is a slow burner, but deliberately so for atmosphere and mood reasons most likely. That being said, it reminded me very much of the elegiac quality of the classic Westerns that 'Hostiles' actually made me feel nostalgic for while watching it. 'Hostiles' is indeed uncompromising, with the violence being the kind that takes no prisoners and isn't afraid to hold back, while not going over-the-top that it feels gratuitous. This can be seen in as early on as the opening scene that is as powerfully gut-wrenching an opening scene of any film from 2017 Just as disturbing are the second appearance of the Comanche and the powerful climax. 'Hostiles' is not non-stop brutality though. There is real sincerity and poetry too.What could have been a major distraction from the main mission, which in itself is very heartfelt and is never lost even with everything else potentially threatening to, is actually what provides the film's heart and vulnerability. Rosalie's plight and back story really resonated with and moved me, as did the very heartfelt coda and a persuasive message, delivered just about right, that has as much relevance now as it did then.'Hostiles' looks stunning visually. The scenery is majestic in the most spectacular of ways, ranging between stark and lush. The period detail is evocative, with the right amount of grit and understated sumptuousness. The cinematography sweeps just as much in a way that is beautiful in a non-flashy but very natural and richly atmospheric fashion.Similarly the music has atmosphere and grace without being intrusive. Sometimes 'Hostiles' has scenes with just dialogue and shots of actor's expressions which speaks volumes with no music or sound featured and all the better for it. It's beautifully directed by Cooper too and much of the dialogue is thoughtful and sincere and the action thrillingly authentic without being over-the-top.Christian Bale gives a performance that is among his all-time best, and he always has been a commanding and powerful screen presence. He has a smouldering, intense authority throughout in a stoic, subtle sense, whether in his stubbornness, his compassion or in action, commanding the screen effortlessly and often in a nuanced way, a knockout in the final 30 minutes. And don't worry, his character-of-its-own moustache is nowhere near as distracting or unintentionally funny as one would think. Making even more of an impression is Rosamund Pike in perhaps her second best performance to date after her exceptional once-in-a-lifetime performance in 'Gone Girl'. She has never been more heart-wrenching or poignant in especially in the first half, when we see how such an every-family-member's-worst-nightmare tragedy has affected and broken Rosalie, something that Pike demonstrates with expressive nuance, pathos and a far wider emotional and expressive range than she has been given credit for in the past. Despite always liking her, it is performances like this, 'Gone Girl' and 'A United Kingdom' that have particularly stretched Pike and played to her strengths and it is this direction that she could keep pursuing. Sadly, it is perhaps too late for either Bale or Pike to be considered for awards attention, if the film had been released earlier either or preferably both could and should have been in serious contention for all the major ones. This may seem like extreme hyperbole, but this is my genuine stance on this. They are very well served by the supporting cast, with especially dignified turns from Q'orianka Kilcher and Wes Studi (who could have been had more screen time but dominates every time he appears, often without saying a huge amount). Ben Foster is also strong. Nobody is bad here. Not that 'Hostiles' is perfect. The villain roles here are rather sketchy, they could have had more to them than one-dimensional (though the Comanche are quite chilling still) ciphers there mainly to provide the conflict, only for them to be dispatched pretty quickly (especially the trio of abductors).Although sincere and thought-provoking on the whole the dialogue rambles at times, meaning a few scenes are bogged down by too much talk that slows things down a little. The middle act is particularly true to this, when the pace doesn't feel as tight and the storytelling not quite as focused (though still gripping). For my liking too many of the secondary cast members have very little to do other than 10 minutes tops of screen time and some lines admittedly delivered well. Perhaps the film is slightly too long as well, but that wasn't as big an issue for me.Overall, a very good film and almost great, with a lot of outstanding elements (especially the visuals, the two leads, the atmosphere and emotional power). Not a film to be hostile towards. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Hostiles
1,bkoganbing,One last assignment,6,20 August 2018,"If the film Hostiles demonstrates anything, it demonstrates how truly brutal the
Indian wars in America were. Set after the Wounded Knee massacre which occured in 1890 that is generally by historians considered to mark the end of 
said wars apparently there were still hostile Indians to deal with.In 1892 as a gesture of humanity none other than Benjamin Harrison prsident of
the United States of America orders that the terminally ill chief of the Cheyennes
who was captured and in prison be returned home to die. Wes Studi is accompanied by his family and accompanying them is an army detail commanded by Captain Christian Bale on the eve of his retirement. As a given it is established that both these men did some pretty brutal things
in the war that could be called atrocities. Studi however with his meeting 
with his Maker just on the horizon is more mellow. When things start Bale
is a hostile as ever.Along the way the patrol also picks up Rosamund Pike whose family was 
recently massacred by some final Comanche holdouts. Having recently had to
bury four of her family, she's got fresh reasons for her hostility.It's quite an odyssey that Bale, Studi, and Pike and the rest go on. In fact that
choice of words isn't just by chance this is a journey where people's character
is tested and not everyone makes it. If you're expecting a treatment of the US
Cavalry like a John Ford film, Hostiles is definitely not it.The pace is slow, almost agonzingly at times and for some reason the director
had people mumbling their dialog and it was hard to here. But Hostiles is
beautifully photographed and words alone don't tell this story.Quite the epic western, Hostiles.",Hostiles
2,Leofwine_draca,Western strives for realism in action and character,6,9 March 2020,"HOSTILES is another dark and dismal western that harks back to the not-so-glory days of the West. This one's set in a post-American Civil War world in which every character seems to be haunted by past misdeeds and personalities are written in shades of grey rather than black or white. It benefits from some solid performances and some very well directed scenes, such as the opening which really draws you straight into the story. Rosamund Pike and Christian Bale play off each other nicely, but as the story goes on you begin to feel that it drags its feet at times and occasionally the direction becomes cheesy. The incident is handled very nicely; there's not a wealth of action here, but that which does exist is realistic and exciting. Wes Studi, Scott Wilson and Ben Foster show up to offer some expected fine supporting turns.",Hostiles
3,SnoopyStyle,great first half,6,1 December 2018,It's 1892 New Mexico. Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is rounding up escaped Indians back to Fort Berringer. He's a veteran of the fight against the Indians. He is forcibly ordered to escort dying Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and his family back to their reservation in Montana. He hates Indians and puts the men in shackles. They come across a burnt out settlement and find survivor Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike). Her family had been massacred by Comanche.The first half is a great western. It has the grim reality of the old west and its vastness of space. It starts with a harrowing attack and the emotional tension does not let up until the hanging. I had hoped for a cat and mouse fight between the group and the Comanche. That fight comes to an abrupt end and we don't even get to see the coup de grace. It then becomes the least fun road trip. It's one incident after another popping up out of nowhere. There was a WWII bomber movie called Memphis Belle which essentially collected various real incidents over twenty five trips and combine them into one sortie. That's what this feels like. It's a whole lot of unconnected incidents all happening on the same trip. This is a good violent western but the non-stop string of random pitfalls make it a difficult journey to stay onboard.,Hostiles
4,Horst_In_Translation,"A decent film, but also a missed opportunity",6,18 June 2018,"Scott Cooper is the man who wrote and directed Jeff Bridges to Oscar glory in ""Crazy Heart"" a few years ago and his newest effort here ""Hostiles"" reunites him with Christian Bale from ""Out of the Furnace"", a film I truly enjoyed a lot not too long ago. Sadly, quality-wise this new movie here is not on par. But it is still a decent watch. Most new western films are more on the indie side these days, but this one here is what you could maybe call a blockbuster western, something you don't see too often anymore these days. Don't be fooled by the poster here on imdb. Christian Bale is the movie and everybody else is just supporting. He is in virtually every scene apart from the first five minutes and it is never in depth about anybody other than his character. And that is fine because Bale is probably among the most gifted performers of his generation. It's interesting to see which directions his career is heading now after the end of Nolan's Batman franchise. Anyway, lets take a look at this film. If you like westerns or Bale, then go check it out. It's not a must-see film by any means and the new approach of depicting Indians as bad guys too, not just the Whites who are harming them, is not executed too well sadly because eventually it's just a group of savages who barely deserve the name Indian and those Indians at the center of it all are very stereotypical and written in the most shallow way one can think of unfortunately. Same can be said about Rosamund Pike, who plays the only female character with a great deal of screen time. Of course, western and women is always a difficult combination, but aside from the very first scene and maybe the one in which she holds her dead baby when meeting Bale's character, there is really nothing interesting about her character and it's such a waste of her talent. How she immediately accepts the blanket from the Indians despite other Indians killing all her people, man and children shortly before is just really unrealistic in terms of how quickly she appreciates them. Of course, she also falls in love with Bale's character and well she could have been left out completely to be honest and the film would not have been any worse. But yeah, it's not Pike's fault by any means, it's all about how she was written. The only real question about her was if she survives in the end given her early comment about where she wants to be buried. Go and watch for yourself if she makes it or if she joins all the fallen.Yes, this is another film where basically one dies after the other like in so many other movies, especially action or western films. It's okay from that perspective. The details of these deaths make sense most of the time I would say. The only thing that really bothered me here was the inclusion of rising star Timothée Chalamet. Or maybe it was good how quickly he was gone because it felt realistic and definitely surprising. This is no stupid underdog story where he rises with his challenges and becomes a man. But of course, then he'd have gotten in the way of Bale too, so it wasn't too unsurprising I guess. The real question is why, with his complete lack of experience, he was part of the troop. But the way he leaves the picture fits well because Bale says early on he would not have taken him into the group and everything Bale, or I should say his character, says in here is basically the law in terms of know-it-all and perfection really. The best example is when the criminal they are leading to his execution manages to get away and Bale says something like let him go and that he does not want to sacrifice another man for him, but still one follows him and ends up dead of course. The character development idea here with Bale being a brutal torturer too early on with many inhumane crimes under his belt into something different and a guy tolerant towards Indians is also not executed too well and there seems little purpose beyond making Bale look as good and likable as possible and let us forget about everything he did in the many years before the film started. So you could ask yourself if his story feels too realistic as a whole. Or if a rougher Daniel Plainview plot could have been more convincing. At considerably over 2 hours, it is a really long movie, one that may not exactly fly by, but is entertaining enough to avoid dragging I'd say. Overall you can put it in the pointless fun category I guess. The depth in terms of characters and story is not convincing enough to truly make an impact and turn it into a mention on the extended list of this year's finest. Far from that actually. Given Cooper's talent and several big-name cast members here, it is closer to a disappointment overall and certainly a bit of a missed opportunity for what could have been another really good film that the westen genre in the 21st century definitely could have needed. Cinematography is also a bit of a letdown compared to what could have been. The (almost) final shot with the close-up on him is the best example of how it could have been way better in terms of atmosphere especially. Still, all in all, despite some flaws, I give it a thumbs-up and it's worth checking out, especially if you like Bale.",Hostiles
5,Prismark10,Grim and strong,8,14 October 2018,"I do not count myself as a western aficionado. We still get all kinds of westerns, modern ones with a revisionist bent.Hostiles is a rare one as it could had been made easily by someone like John Ford with John Wayne attached or Anthony Mann with James Stewart starring as long as the language and violence was toned down.After a violent opening when Comanches kill a family leaving a woman Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike) widowed, childless and distraught. The film begins to look like an allegory on the war on terror.Set in 1892, Captain Blocker (Christian Bale) a war hero and a notorious slayer of Indians has been ordered to escort the imprisoned chief of the Cheyennes and his family to Montana where he can die. This gesture has been authorised by the President of the United States.Blocker is reluctant to this. Both he and the Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk have committed atrocities and Blocker is full of hate. However as Blocker is nearing retirement he wants to keep his pension and so he reluctantly agrees.During their journey they encounter Quaid who is delirious. Blocker and his men help to bury her children and she accompanies them. As they are attacked by Comanches, Blocker needs to join forces with Yellow Hawk and his family to fight the Comanches.Further on the group find other dangers, fur traders, a prisoner that needs to be escorted. All these events bring a new understanding between Blocker and Yellow Hawk as well giving Quaid some hope for the future.The film is episodic with the various dangers the group find. Visually the film looks great and it is the acting by Bale and Pike that lifts the film.",Hostiles
6,nogodnomasters,You're no angel your own self.,8,1 March 2018,"Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is known as an Indian killer and he is nearing retirement in New Mexico. In the changing progressive times of 1892, Blocker is given one final assignment. He must escort prisoner Cheyenne Chief Yellow Hawk and family back to Montana so he can die in their sacred land. Blocker is forced. The Chief is a killer of soldiers as Blocker is a killer of Indians. Along the way they pick up Rosalind Pike whose family was wiped out by a Comanche attack in the first scene. The film is over 2 hours long. It forces our main characters to take a long hard look at themselves and come to conclusions they didn't think possible. It is a bitter-sweet western with enough action and drama to keep up a good pace. It has a message, but doesn't rip your heart out like ""Soldier Blue."" Guide: F-word. No nudity.",Hostiles
7,kosmasp,Who's bad?,9,19 August 2018,"When you see the horrible opening sequence of the movie and you see the hate going around, you can't help wondering about the circle of violence. It creates new hate, new action and new fights amongst each other. It doesn't seem to stop. It's anything but black and white (no pun intended to any skin colors) but has quite some grey areas.You can see and you will be able to correctly guess the journey of Christian Bales story. His path, his way and how he perceives things. There is tension, which is obvious and from that tension a lot of interesting situation arise. Being able to do your duty, but also seeing a change in behavior. The movie has quite some brutal, explicit violence in it, but it also does a lot of things that may give you pause to think. It is not an easy movie to watch, not just because of that, but also because it is generally slow paced. This will not be everyones cup of tea ... actually with its raw and down and dirty nature it is anything but a cup of tea ...",Hostiles
8,classicsoncall,"""Don't look back, my friend.""",9,7 August 2018,"The opening scene is reminiscent of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", but instead of the male head of household surviving a savage attack by Comanche Rattlesnakes, it's the wife who bears witness to the brutal murder of her husband and three children. She alone survives the furious onslaught, later to be discovered by a traveling band of soldiers escorting a dying Cheyenne War Chief to his ancestral home in Montana's Valley of the Bears. It's fascinating to observe all the passion and nuance Rosamund Pike puts into her roles. She became a favorite of mine for her scintillating portrayal in ""Gone Girl"", while here she displays all the torment and grief of a woman confronted by the incalculable loss of her entire family.It's often observed that the modern day Western is dead, but films like ""Bone Tomahawk"" and ""Slow West"" prove that you can't bury the genre just yet. ""Hostiles"" achieves powerful resonance in it's portrayal of former warrior adversaries adjusting to the passing ways of the Old West. Set in 1892, the story follows Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) as he leads a small cavalry party northward on a mission to deliver a former enemy and his family to their territorial homeland. Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) appears to have buried his own personal animosities while having been held captive at Fort Berringer. His early offer of help to Blocker to survive a savage band of roving Comanches is eventually accepted in good faith after the shackled chief and his son Black Hawk (Adam Beach) fight valiantly to defend themselves and their soldier escorts. Throughout the film, the effects of a brutal past in the soldier life of both Captain Blocker and his Master Sergeant Tommy Metz (Rory Cochrane) are given over to brooding contemplation. The way each man deals with it tested along the way via various dangerous encounters. It's some of those thoughtful scenes in which director Scott Cooper chooses to steady the pace of the film to examine the conflict in the expressions of Blocker, Metz, and Roslaie Quaid (Pike). For that reason, some viewers will criticize the picture for being too slow or boring, but for this viewer, those moments offer the added dimension of personal, inner turmoil that makes the story so poignant.If there's an element I would criticize in the story it would be the apparently abrupt transition of Rosalie Quaid from shattered housewife to a functioning member of the Blocker party. Given the time constraints a director must face, it would have been difficult to effect such a change no matter what length the movie might have gone. What I did find encouraging though was the manner in which the picture concluded. It would have been far too easy and cliched for Blocker to effect an overt relationship with Ms. Quaid. The way Blocker boarded the Chicago bound train reflected his own conflicted ambiguity about leaving his violent and brutal past behind. I thought that was an effective way to end the story.One last thought. I always keep an eye and ear open for the names of Indian characters in films like this. In this case, most of them were not unusually descriptive. You had the aforementioned Yellow Hawk and Black Hawk, along with their family members Elk Woman and Living Woman. However I was pleasantly surprised to check the cast list and learn the name of the young actor who portrayed Black Hawk's son, Little Bear. It's Xavier Horsechief - I mean, really, how cool is that?",Hostiles
9,ma-cortes,A good and violent Western from director Scott Cooper about a world weary captain well played by Christain Bale who has to escort an Indian Chief and his family,7,15 March 2020,"It is set in 1892, long time after American Civil War, a family : Scott Sheperd, Rosemund Pike and their three children, are attacked by marauding Comanches who are still on the warpath . The wife called Rosalee Quaid : Rosamund Pike, arranges to escape and later she joins an expedition. A notorius army captain about to retirement called Joseph Blockner : Christian Bale, is called by aging Colonel Biggs : Stephen Lang, to carrry out a dangerous mission, under threat to lost his pension and to be submitted to a Martial Court if he doesn't executes it. As Blockner reluctantly agrees to escort a dying Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk : Wes Studi , and Black Hawk : Adam Beach and members of their family, and other grandsons, towards the ancestral lands of their ancestors in Montana. Blockner joins a little team formed by a promising Lieutenant fresh from West Point named Kidder : Jesse Plemmons, an African-American Private : Jonathan Majors, a naive, unexperimented French Corporal called DeJardin : Timothee Chalamet, among others . All of them lock horns on their way to battle vicious Comanches and other landowners who attack them.This is a nice cavalry/Indian Western with noisy action, thrills, chills , violent attacks , assaults and loads of action. Exciting, though it is too, the film is not without its thoughtful side. Well scripted Scott Sheperd and competently paced. This powerful Western has action, drama and impressive exteriors in equal measure . Christian Bale gives a fine acting as the legendary, two-fisted officer and Wes Studi is also very good as the renegade Indian chieftain who was formerly responsible of death of several comrades . The film deals with the perilous and risked way that the motley expedition carries out and when a rebel Comanche group track down, stalks and eventually attack them. These attackers Indians are the bad guys but Indians played by Wes Studi, Adam Beach and their family are really the good guys .The main attraction here is the detailed character studio of the interesting roles as captain Blockner/Bale, as a wise, world-weary officer who while not justifying Indian action, as he believes them all to be savages, little more than animals until he sees the savagery of other White Men and he eventually gets sympathy for the Indian chief along with his family, as well as the strong, tough widowed settler magnificently performed by Rosamund Pike who suffers a lot of distresses. These important characters are well acompanied by a great support cast, such as Wes Studi, Adam Beach, Jesse Plemmons, Ben Foster, Roy Cochrane, Peter Mullan, Stephen Lang, Scott Sheperd and many others.
It packs a colorful and evocative cinematography by Masanoba Takayanoga shot on gorgeous locations. As well as a thrilling and sensitive musical score by Max Richter. The motion picture was compellingly written by Douglas Stewart and director Scottt Copper himself and competently made by Scott Cooper. Scott is a fine craftsman who has directed a few but decent films as Black Mass, Out of the furnace and Crazy Heart.Rating 7/10. A violent, gritty western that enjoyed success enough, being necessary a better re-evaluation after its first release in 1917. Worthwhile seeing. Essential and indispensable watching.",Hostiles
10,hitchcockthelegend,"I've killed everything that's walked or crawled. If you do it enough, you get used to it.",9,14 April 2019,"Hostiles is directed by Scott Cooper and Cooper adapts the screenplay from the story written by Donald E. Stewart. It stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi, Rory Cochrane, John Benjamin Hickey, Jeremiah Wilks and Jesse Plemons. Music is by Max Richter and cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi.In 1892, legendary Capt. Joseph J. Blocker (Bale) reluctantly has to escort his old Cheyenne adversary Chief Yellow Hawk (Studi) and his family through dangerous territories. The aim is to get them to the Cheyenne tribal homelands of Montana so Yellow Hawk can get his wish to die in peace.Where we at these days with the grand old bastion of American cinema, the Western? The only real constant is that thankfully for lovers of the form there are new directors willing to tackle the genre and bring something to the newer generations. Here we have Scott Cooper, who right from the off hasn't hid the fact that Hostiles is his rallying call for a better world, or at least a better understanding of different cultures. What better way to cry out than to do it in a Western, using the Indian Wars as the backdrop. Perfect really.Hostiles jumps right out of the blocks to grab you by the throat with soul shattering violence, with Cooper and his team initially facing charges of old by fronting up a one sided argument - but there is more. Quickly a switch ensures that both sides of this particular bloody coin have been tossed, scene set for what will follow. A meeting back at Fort Berringer where Captain Blocker receives the orders he simply doesn't want to obey is in hushed tones, yet the words being spoken are brutally loud and to the point. And on to the journey, damaged souls unbound who not only have to fear hostiles from outside their group, but the hostiles within it and within themselves.As the story moves through the journey undertaken by our protagonists, the makers have not cut corners with the characterisations, the emotional development of the principals is one of the film's strengths (cast are superb, there's a real authenticity to their respective performances). Also worthy is the pacing, it is deliberately unhurried and allows the characters to breathe, it also gives the jolts of action more potency, whilst simultaneously we can absorb the stunning landscapes (New Mexico/Arizona) and rejoice at the pleasures of an outdoor Western. While how nice it is to have a musical score that doesn't blunderbuss the important sequences, rounding out what is a top technical production.There's some irritants here, though, so it's not perfect, and this is before it is marked poorly by those not in sync with the messages of the piece. Ben Foster turns up as Philip Wills, a most edgy character that makes one wish there was far more of him in the pic, for as it is it ends up feeling a bit pointless since he only emphasises what we have learned about Blocker at the start. Then there's a key turn of events for the story's coup de grâce that leaves a frustrating taste in the mouth, not as a film killer or even close in fact, but it should have gone another way one feels. Especially given the two sides of the argument stance Cooper and co had began with.Yet this is for Western fans a real treat, following in the footsteps of new era classics like Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven, Hostiles may have a new age sensibility in its narrative thrust, but traditionally old age adultness propels it forward. 9/10",Hostiles
11,zardoz-13,Saddle-Sore and Pretentious Despite Its Splendid Cast,7,9 February 2018,"Good westerns are few and far between nowadays. ""Black Mass"" writer & director Stuart Cooper's cavalry vs. the Indians western ""Hostiles,"" co-starring Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike, ranks as above-average. Not only does ""Hostiles"" resemble John Ford's greatest western, ""The Searchers"" (1956), starring John Wayne, but it also pays tribute to Ford's farewell film, ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), with its revisionist sentiments about the ghastly treatment of Native Americans. Ford enjoyed a rewarding career in Hollywood depicting the wholesale slaughter of Native Americans in his popular John Wayne cavalry epics: ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), and ""Rio Grande"" (1950). Ultimately, Ford performed an about-face where Indians were concerned with ""Cheyenne Autumn."" Similarly, critics are comparing ""Hostiles"" to Clint Eastwood's final oater ""Unforgiven"" (1992), and its sentiments about killing. Eastwood's western image evolved from his portrayal of an amiable cowboy in television's ""Rawhide"" (1959-1965) to a ruthless bounty hunter in Sergio Leone's bloodthirsty Spaghetti westerns before the actor made his characters contemplative in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976), ""Pale Rider"" (1985), and ""Unforgiven"" (1992). ""Unforgiven"" constituted a meditation on violence where it is depicted as anything but glamorous. Director Stuart Cooper wastes too much time on these two themes: the annihilation of Native Americans and the repulsion for bloodshed. Unfortunately, ""Hostiles"" ponders these profound themes rather than entertaining us with unforgettable action. Nothing happens for long stretches as the cavalry ushers a notorious Indian chief from New Mexico to Montana, where the government has decided that he may die in honor. During that long trek, the cavalry encounters other murderous Native Americans as well as some wholly despicable Caucasians. Clocking in at a dreary 135 minutes, this scenic horse opera seems as apologetic as it is saddle-sore. ""Hostiles"" unfolds on the frontier in 1892 with a sudden, suspenseful Indian attack on peaceful New Mexican homesteaders. Murderous Comanche raiders wearing war paint descend upon Wesley Quaid (Scott Shepherd of ""Side Effects""), his wife Rosalee (Rosamund Pike of ""Die Another Day""), and their teenage daughters with little warning. Not only do these ferocious savages kill Wesley without difficulty, but they also gun down Wesley's two daughters, Lucy (Ava Cooper) and Sylvie (Stella Cooper), as they flee behind their mother into the woods. Miraculously, Rosalee evades the hostiles, even though she has her newborn cradled in her arms. She hides in the woods while the Indians burn their house down and then ride away. Tragically, Rosalee realizes afterward the baby in her arms is dead, too. She bundles the bodies back to the burnt house and covers them up as if they were asleep. The scene shifts to a faraway U.S. Cavalry fort. ""3:10 to Yuma"" actor Christian Bale plays Captain Joseph Blocker, an unrepentant, Indian-hating cavalry officer. He shares the sentiments of Civil War-era General Phil Sheridan, who said: ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."" Colonel Abraham Biggs (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"") summons Blocker with orders for him to take a dying Cheyenne, Indian Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi of ""Last of the Mohicans""), and his family back to Montana. According to Colonel Biggs, Yellow Hawk is dying from cancer, and President Harrison has granted the chief's wish to die in his ancestral lands. Initially, Blocker is not ecstatic with those orders, and he refuses to accommodate the colonel because he abhors Indians generally and Chief Yellow Hawk specifically. We learn throughout ""Hostiles"" that Blocker has been slaughtering Indians for twenty years. He has taken part in atrocities galore, and he has no qualms about killing Native Americans. Nevertheless, Biggs points out, if Blocker doesn't carry out the Presidential order to resettle Yellow Hawk that he will have to convene a court-martial. Moreover, Blocker will lose his Government pension. Miserably, Blocker agrees to shepherd Yellow Hawk to Montana. No sooner has Blocker's small patrol left the fort than he orders his sergeant to shackle Yellow Hawk. He doesn't trust him. Eventually, they encounter the grief-stricken, traumatized Rosalee, and Blocker's troopers bury her dead for her. Afterward, Rosalee accompanies the escort. Before they reach Montana, Blocker and company will tangle not only with the same Comanches that wiped out Rosalee's family, but also hostile white ranchers and trappers. At first, Blocker doesn't change his attitude toward Chief Yellow Hawk. By the time they reach their destination, the cavalry captain experiences a change of attitude. Yellow Hawk wins Blocker's respect. When a pugnacious white landowner demands that Blocker get off his sprawling acreage or he will kill them, presidential order notwithstanding, Blocker no longer has any qualms about killing his own kind. Incredibly, Rosalee undergoes a similar change, and she sympathizes for the chief and his plight. When the final showdown comes between Blocker and the rancher, Rosalee pitches in to help, demonstrating her accuracy with a repeating rifle.Stuart Cooper, who also helmed ""Crazy Heart"" (2009) with Jeff Bridges and ""Out of the Furnace"" (2013) with Christian Bale, adapted ""Hostiles"" from an unpublished manuscript by the late Donald Stewart, best known for his screenplay for ""The Hunt for Red October."" Basically, ""Hostiles"" qualifies as an average oater, bolstered by a sterling cast. Bale couldn't be better, neither could his co-stars, especially Rosamund Pike, Rory Cochrane, and Stephen Lang. Ironically, despite its apologetic attitude to Native Americans, Cooper wastes Wes Studi and Adam Beach peripheral roles that keep them on the sidelines. Whatever the reason, an interesting episode where Yellow Hawk and his son sneak out of camp to kill the Comanches harassing them has been reduced to an expository dialogue scene rather than an exciting action scene. Studi and Beach wind up looking little more than noble. Sadly, ""Hostiles"" is also predictable, too. Inevitably, we know Captain Blocker is going to change his attitude, display grudging respect for his nemesis Yellow Hawk, and then butcher those whites who interfere with his orders.

Yellow Hawk was responsible for the deaths of a number of Blocker's friends, and Blocker harbours deep resentment. On the journey, the small detail picks up Mrs Quaid, whose husband and 3 children were killed by a raiding party at the start of the film. Things happen during the journey.From the outset, it is clear that this film will tell of two old adversaries learning that their black and white views mask a world drawn in shades of grey, which is fine. The incidents along the way are mostly pretty violent and serve to illuminate the issues at the heart of this movie. The scenery and cinematography are very good, and Wes Studi, as Yellow Hawk, delivers a deep performance with very little.Hostiles is an excellent film struggling to escape from a quite good film, but not quite managing. Why? For one thing, the narrative rambles and much of what happens fails to satisfy dramatically in terms of cause and effect. The slaughter of Mrs Quaid's, family, for instance, deserved to have greater consequence. And the fates of various characters come across as a bit random and written that way for the sake of being perverse.Christian Bale, as Blocker, gives a performance almost devoid of emotion. I didn't find it convincing.And, in Scott Cooper, we have a director who finds himself unable to edit his own screenplay or his directorial choices sufficiently savagely to give the film a much-needed kick in the trousers. The film would have been improved by having at least 30 minutes cut from the 140 minutes running time. This film could - and should - have been much better.",Hostiles

15,ferguson-6,Slow burn western with a message,7,3 January 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a filmmaker is influenced by one of the all-time classics, that filmmaker best deliver a movie that not only stands up to inevitable comparisons, but also one that has its own identity, playing as more than a copy. Writer/director Scott Cooper (from a manuscript by the late Oscar winner Donald E Stewart) succeeds on both counts even as he tips his Stetson to John Ford's western classic THE SEARCHERS. If you are familiar with Mr. Cooper's CRAZY HEART and OUT OF THE FURNACE, then you know his style is never hurried, and to expect minimal dialogue. You might think of him as the anti-Aaron Sorkin. Cooper's characters tend to only say what must be said, and prefer to communicate through subtle gestures and actions that define their character. In this latest, he re-teams with Oscar winner Christian Bale, who plays the quietly simmering Captain Blocker. It's 1892, and the legendary Army officer/soldier/guide is ordered to escort a Cheyenne Chief and his family through dangerous and unchartered New Mexico territory, so that the Chief may die in peace in his native Valley of the Bears, Montana. 
During a career of brutal warfare against the Native Americans, Captain Blocker has developed a deep-seeded hatred, and only accepts the assignment after his pension is threatened.The opening sequence immediately immerses us in the constant danger faced during this era. Rosamund Pike watches as her homesteading family is brutally slaughtered by Comanche warriors. She survives only by escaping into the woods, although it's a bit of stretch to believe that this homemaker marm could outwit the Comanches. Circumstances find Ms. Pike's traumatized character (the actress's go-to wide-eyed look) joining and complicating Captain Blocker's convoy. Wes Studi plays Chief Yellow Hawk, and the film's only weakness is in his not having a more substantive role, as we are teased a couple of times with nuanced exchanges between he and Bales' Blocker. The stellar supporting cast includes Rory Cochrane, Jonathan Majors, John Benjamin Hickey, Stephen Lang, Bill Camp, Jesse Plemons, Timothy Chalamet, Adam Beach, Peter Mullan, and Scott Wilson. Ben Foster also appears as an Army soldier accused of murder ... another addition to the convoy, as he is to be escorted to prison. The somber film follows this traveling party as they move slowly and methodically across the open plains and wilderness. There are no moments of levity, as death and danger are constantly hovering. No real reason for optimism exists, and surviving the day is the only goal. Despite the appearance of little happening, there is much going on here for the characters and in commentary on the times. At its core, the story is about Blocker's reclamation of his soul and humanity; although redemption may not be possible as he recalls Julius Caesar and getting used to killing, but not to losing men.Political correctness is avoided in many scenes, though the message is clear that the hatred between the Native Americans and the mostly Anglo settlers and soldiers stems from the unethical seizure of land by violent force. Amends are not possible even with a change of heart. It's in these moments where we desire a more in-depth look at the various native factions. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi works with some amazing vistas, landscapes and rock formations. He deftly balances the breathtaking beauty of the land with the intimacy of the mission. There is a relentless undercurrent of simmering emotion throughout the film, much of which comes courtesy of Christian Bale. Sporting a mustache to rival Poirot, Bale is remarkably adept at silently expressing disgust, rage, resolve and resignation. His groans and grunts convey as much as soliloquies for many actors. While he feels remorse and seeks redemption, we are left with the not-especially-upbeat message that we are what we are.",Hostiles

Every character here, be it the protagonist, or the characters around him, are unsettled & victims of hate & hatred. This is a story about people who want to question their hate for one-another, but are unable to, due to their given circumstances. This is a human story & the sheer brutality here depicts a side of humanity we all are aware off. Its told with honesty, albeit, with gut-wrenching aggression.Scott Cooper is in top-form this time around. 'Hostiles' is a slow-moving, poetic piece, that sees the filmmaker in strong command.

21,Hellmant,"emotionally interesting (at times), but it's also really slow-paced.",8,26 January 2018,"'HOSTILES': Four Stars (Out of Five)A western about a U.S. cavalry officer who's tasked with escorting a Cheyenne war chief, and his family (against his will), to Montana in 1892. It stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi, Rory Cochrane, Ben Foster, Stephen Lang, Jesse Plemons, Timothee Chalamet, Adam Beach and Q'orianka Kilcher. The film was written and directed by Scott Cooper, who also helmed 'CRAZY HEART' and 'OUT OF THE FURNACE' (also starring Bale), and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics so far. I found it to be well made, and emotionally interesting (at times), but it's also really slow-paced. The story is set in Fort Berringer, New Mexico, in 1892. Captain Joseph J. Blocker (Bale) has had a lot of war experience, and he's also built up an extreme amount of hate for Native Americans because of it. So when he's asked to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief, named Yellow Hawk (Studi), and his family, to Montana, he passionately refuses. His commanding officer, Colonel Abraham Biggs (Lang), informs him that it's a direct order from the President though, and Blocker's approaching retirement will be threatened if he doesn't comply. So Blocker reluctantly follows his orders. Along the way he meets a suicidal widow, named Rosalie Quaid (Pike), who's family was just killed by Comanche Indians. Blocker and his men are soon attacked by the same Comanche party. The movie is beautifully shot, and acted, and parts of it seem like they should be really emotional. Still the movie is just way too long and slow-paced. I wouldn't have a problem with the length though, if there was just a little more going on. The couple in front of me (at the theater) asked me what I thought of it, after it was over, and I said 'pretty good'. They replied ""it was just so boring though, I was expecting a lot more excitement"". I'm so used to slow-paced Oscar bait, that I'm pretty used to watching boring movies like this, and I'm not overly critical of them (for it) either. The movie is definitely a challenge to sit through though. It's well made, and Bale is once again amazing in the lead, but you have to have a lot of patience to really enjoy it (I'd say).",Hostiles

If there are common themes running through his work you might say they are masculinity and that of the outlaw; the outlaw as in men who stand on the other side of the law. His films are usually violent and relentless, his debut ""Crazy Heart"" being the rare exception, though it too dealt with a kind of outlaw, a country-and-western singer unwilling to conform.""Hostiles"" is a western but while in style it adheres very much to the kind of classic westerns John Ford himself might have made, the plot is very different from what we have become used to. It stars Christian Bale, (outstanding, but when is he ever less than outstanding), as the soldier tasked with escorting an Indian chief and his family back to their homeland and through 'hostile' territory. On route he meets a woman, (the excellent Rosamund Pike), whose family have been massacred and he is forced to bring her along.It is a totally uncompromising film and deals with the kind of subject matter, (guilt, grief, redemption, forgiveness), that the commercial cinema often overlooks and Cooper handles these themes with a rare seriousness. As I said, he is a director who makes few concessions; he seems unconcerned with who will watch his films. ""Hostiles"" has all the hallmarks of a great western but despite the violence and its action sequences is unlikely to appeal to a mass audience any more than his last two films did.

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Takes a while to get going, but is rich and engaging once it does.",7,8 January 2019,"'Hostiles (2017)' is a slow and strangely-paced piece that ultimately succeeds because it's a relatively deep character-study. Director Scott Cooper talks about the movie only being a western in location, in so far as it's a story that could take place during pretty much any point in history. This is true, as its through-line of overcoming personal prejudices and your own past self is a very relevant theme, especially as it relates to the American Western and how America is coming to re-evaluate the genre itself - as well as its own society. Plus, the feature doesn't shy away from the systematic elements of such a prejudicial period and isn't necessarily an 'everything works out okay' affair, making sure the inherent bleakness of the situation is constantly present. It takes quite a while for these themes to properly manifest themselves, however, which leads to the first half of the flick feeling unsteady and, in a way, like it's not sure what it's about. Of course, this is remedied by its end; it's ultimately a nuanced experience which has a good handle on its core principles. It isn't an action film either, despite several competently painful action scenes. Instead, steady filmmaking drives the story forward as our well-acted characters slowly unravel their hidden, and somewhat unexpected, depths. It's very much a journey, both inside and out, and this is reflected in the way that it's told; wide-shots of sweeping vistas swallowing our ant-like convoy contrast with several quieter camp-side character moments. There's very little exposition, putting you square in the situation and making each small reveal all the more impressively blindsiding. Usually, these come in the form of a hidden depth to a preexisting relationship, all of which are rendered extremely realistically. By the film's end, so much has happened that it can be hard to keep track of it all. What isn't hard to track is the distinct journey of our hero and his struggle to overcome the bias-based beliefs that keep him in his own personal civil war. It is unfortunate that the Native American characters who act as a catalyst for his change are, arguably, the least developed in the picture; it's not like they're inactive, or even especially weak, but they aren't afforded the same care as most of the other players and, as such, can sometimes seem more like plot devices than people. Really, we should have a 'western' told entirely from a Native American perspective by now; that would be the really interesting take. Nevertheless, the third act becomes properly beautiful, allowing us to revel in the connections of our characters and the destination they've worked so hard to reach. It isn't long before brutality seeps back into the fray, though, making the serenity you've just experienced all the more bittersweet. The ending is hopeful, yet tragic. All the way through, this is a film that pulls no punches. It's an impactful and surprisingly deep 'heart of darkness'-style journey. It may take a while to get going, but it's a rich and engaging experience once it does. 7/10",Hostiles
25,richardchatten,Typically Ponderous 'Modern' Western,4,28 August 2018,"'Hostiles' naturally looks terrific, but the storyline about two mortal foes learning grudging respect for each other in the face of adversity isn't exactly new, and writer-director Scott Cooper constantly encourages his actors to lend gravitas to the proceedings by mumbling ve-ry slow-ly and ve-ry qui-e-tly, with frequent pauses to stand back and admire the scenery under the fond impression that he's creating atmosphere rather than simply neglecting to construct a coherent narrative.",Hostiles
26,bowmanblue,No need to hold on to your hats,7,8 January 2018,"If the film title 'Snakes on a Plane' told the audience everything they needed to know about the story, 'Hostiles' goes the other way entirely. Is it set in space? Or the Second World War? Or is it about hostile bacteria invading the human body? Well, despite its pretty much nondescript title, it's actually set in the blood-thirsty days of 1892 and a battle-hardened soldier (Christian Bale) is reluctantly charged with the task of escorting some newly-released Native American prisoners across the country where the sickly eldest of which now wishes to die in his homeland. Therefore the cast is divided into the group of soldiers and the group of Native Americans, who naturally butt heads more than once along the way. This is largely because Bale's elderly 'prisoner' was responsible for many of Bale's former friends in the force.This certainly sets up the story nicely for plenty of tension between the two groups, but - and I hope I'm not spoiling this too much - you can kind of see where the plot is going to go from the opening scene. And, while we're on the subject of the opening five minutes, I have to point out that it's one of the most grisly and disturbing scenes I've seen in mainstream cinema in a long time. For there's another bunch of Comanche Native Americans on the prowl who are more than happy to scalp anyone - and that includes fellow Native Americans - who they come across. They wipe out a local farming community leaving only Rosamund Pike's character alive until the main cast stumble across what remains of her home. So, you can probably guess that Bale's team will have to bury his differences with his captives in order to survive the journey.Now, Bale is no stranger to 'carrying' a film on his own and, I'm pleased to say after the 'blip' that was 'Terminator: Salvation,' he looks like he's confident to do it once more. This really is his film and I found him the most interesting of all the cast. He's a battle-hardened soldier who's no stranger from murdering those Native Americans he's now forced to protect. However, as brutal as he is to those he deems 'savage,' he shows nothing but total respect and compassion to the 'victim' Rosamund Pike and he seems to anticipate her feelings with a degree of empathy that isn't often seen when the character is supposed to be some sort of 'grunt' in the military. The film looks great and the director has clearly taken a lot of care and attention to crafting each shot. However, don't expect the film to be that fast-paced. Just because there are some moments of action and gore, the setting doesn't lend itself to anything really 'high-octane' that's on a par with other action scenes in today's cinema. Plus the film is long and, as much as I enjoyed it, the length may well put me off from watching it again any time soon. I reckon if you cut about fifteen minutes out of the story (mainly in the final act) you'd have a much tighter piece that would still have focused on the characters' journey as they are forced to grow together.Don't expect an 'action/adventure,' but do expect a slow-moving character piece in a 'Wild West' kind of backdrop. Another good one for Christian Bale's CV.",Hostiles
27,dromasca,a late reconciliation,8,16 October 2021,"War has always been a cruel and violent affair and the traumas caused by conflicts in the souls of participants and victims is not a 20th century invention. This would be the main message of Scott Cooper's 2017 film 'Hostiles'. The story that takes place in the last decade of the 19th century uses motifs and the visual repertoire of the western genre to examine a painful episode in the American history - the wars between government armies and American Indian tribes. It is not, of course, a new theme, it has been addressed in many classic films of the genre, but the violence of the conflict and its collateral victims have rarely been presented from such a sharp realistic perspective. 'Hostiles' manages to rise above the level of exploiting violence for commercial purposes, proposing a story and bring to screen heroes who have the strength to overcome the animosities of the past, thus instilling the hope of a possible reconciliation.Clashes seem inevitable between the characters in 'Hostiles'. Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is assigned to accompany the Indian chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and his family on a final journey to the place where he was born and where he would die after many years in captivity. Military discipline and the threat of losing his approaching pension convince Blocker to accept a mission he dislikes, namely to escort safely the head of his former enemies. Between them there is a whole history of fighting and cruelty on both sides. On their way, they meet Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike), a traumatised woman who has just lost her husband and three children killed in an attack by another Indian tribe. The journey of the former enemies through the prairies and mountains of the continent takes place in conditions of permanent danger, which forces them to fight together to survive, becoming an opportunity to know each other and recognise the absurdity of violence.'Hostiles' has remarkable visual qualities and the name of Masanobu Takayanagi, the director of cinematography must be mentioned. He takes the traditional elements of the western and alternates them with long shots that focus on the characters and their feelings. All the heroes of the film bear the burden of wounds and the psychological scars of the violence they witnessed or executed. The characters are believable and the slow pace of the story telling gives them time to reveal and develop. The counterpoint of the fast-paced action scenes is welcome. The only major problem with the film is, in my opinion, the insistence with which the messages are repeated and the way too explicit they are exposed. The idea that physical closeness gives the opportunity to know the enemy, and that understanding his motivations, recognising humanity and rejecting demonisation are prerequisites for reconciliation is clear from start and I do not think it should be repeated explicitly. The desire to conform to the criteria of diversity and political correctness, even when it comes to history, is beginning to have a negative influence on the screenplays of films of this kind. Fortunately, in 'Hostiles' the intense acting (especially by Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike) helps us forget the excessive rhetoric of part of the text and situations. The film manages to bring to the screen a vivid and believable story from one of the most interesting periods of American history.",Hostiles
28,ThomasDrufke,Hard Hitting Drama With Breathtaking Performances,8,28 January 2018,"I've never quite been able to grasp what it is about Scott Cooper's films that make them very good but not great. With all 4 of his feature films (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace, Black Mass, and now Hostiles) he has great scripts, talented actors, and a knack for directing hard hitting drama. But it's difficult to put my finger on what's missing from them. All of the aforementioned films I have given solid reviews too, but I've never been blown away by anything Cooper does. It could very well just be that he hasn't had his Oscar caliber film yet. But it also could be that his movies tend to lack one particularly important aspect, heart.Hostiles is a harsh take on the mostly dead genre of western filmmaking. I myself love a good western, as they often exemplify a good vs evil story that can rival the best that storytelling has to offer. And they're even better when the lines of good and evil are blurred entirely. When Hostiles shines most, is when its characters are forced to make decisions that go against everything and anything you thought they stood for, making for impressively effective character beats.Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi, Ben Foster, Stephen Lang, and Jesse Plemons are among this tremendously well-rounded cast. And clearly, the highlight of the film is the acting, particularly, Studi and Bale. It's not necessarily a story you haven't seen - a man going against his world beliefs to help the very people he has sworn for years to go against/kill - but it's never a story I'm going to deny seeing. Bale plays the conflicted Army Captain, Joseph Blocker, forced to escort a Cheyenne Chief (Studi) and his family to their home. The Dynamic gets more complicated when we find out there's a history between the two (not seen on camera) that gives them both reason to want to kill each other. It's that very dynamic that carries the movie from beginning to end.It's a similar plot to 3:10 to Yuma, also a Bale led Western about a man escorting a criminal to a certain place, but Hostiles is a far more brutal affair of violence, betrayal, and other things that are often found in this bloody genre. Even if there could be a helluva lot more heart and weight to the turning points or big moments, I was enthralled with Hostiles because of its unforgettable visuals and breathtaking performances.8.5/10",Hostiles

Blocker (Christian Bale) is tasked with one last mission: escort ailing Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) to his tribal burial grounds up north.En route to Montana, Blocker's regiment (Jesse Plemons, Timothée Chalamet) encounters a distraught colonist (Rosamund Pike) whose family was slaughtered by Comanche, as well as a disgraced soldier (Ben Foster) on his way to the gallows.While it does veer in to the stereotypical territory found in old frontier films, this oater at least has strong First Nations actors involved who honour the dialect. Nevertheless, none of that authenticity helps the splintered and ambling script filled with more clichés.Incidentally, when white people jokingly wore brown face paint in the old west, they got shot.

31,851222,Hostiles,10,11 February 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Hostiles"" (2017) is a sad movie. Sadness, forgiveness and redemption were its running themes. From the brutal opening till the very last end, the characters in this movie are looking for redemption and salvation. The movie could have easily been set in these days or location and it won't made a big difference, as the theme is universal. ""Hostiles"" is set in the old west and it works as a great western which is in the same spirit with ""Unforgiven"" then lets say ""The Magnificent Seven"". I loved performances in this movie by everyone, and of course Christian Bale is terrific in here - you can't expect anything else from him - he is one of the very best actors off all time in my opinion. Directing by Scott Cooper was amazing - this movie is superbly paced, terrifically acted and its much more serious then your typical westerns in every possible way.Overall, ""Hostiles"" is a great movie. Its brutal, sad and yet at the very end the is a light. Its superbly acted and crafted. One of the better movies from 2017.",Hostiles
32,cruise01,A well played drama and a sharp plot but is left behind from a dull direction.,6,27 April 2018,"Hostiles (3 out of 5 stars).Hostiles is a fair western film with some okay performances. Good story. And decent thrills/action. The plot takes place in 1890's were Rosalee (Rosamund Pike) and her family are attacked by Comanche's party. Leaving her stranded. While Capt. Joseph (Christian Bale) is assigned to escort a dying Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and his family back to their tribal land in Montana. They cross paths with Rosalee and other Comanche's attack party.The plot was good. It is about a story of loss, vengeance, and redemption with its theme. The main character played by Christian Bale started as the antihero. Who did not care about the natives after they have disfigured his fellow friends. As he travels with a group of Cheyenne natives and are trying to do what is right by bringing them home. He will go against his vengeance belief to accomplish his goals. Same with Rosalee, after she has witnessed her family getting slaughtered by the Comanche natives. The performances were decent. Christian Bale did good. Rosamund Pike delivered with a character that seemed like she has nothing left in the world. Wes Studi was okay as the Cheyenne Chief. Director Scott Cooper managed deliver a well-shot direction for a western drama film. But when it came to the action and shoot out scenes. It went sideways like a cheap direction. Characters run around aimlessly trying to shoot each other. Sometimes the editing and cinematography work are so fast with its camera movie and quick cuts it gets confusing. And when these shoot out scenes happen. It really is difficult to figure out who is shooting who. The direction can get a little slow and boring with its western concept. When these characters spent more time traveling from one beautiful scenery to another as they make camp and discuss about their perspectives of life. While nothing really happens until they reach Montana for a little brief gun battle. Overall, Hostiles is a fair western film. The cast was okay. The plot is good and sharp. The action and direction is dull and tedious. I will recommend this film as a rental.",Hostiles
33,Dr_Coulardeau,Survival requires a lot more than just plain life,10,21 November 2018,"A part of me dies with this film. I have been nourished on the final solution of the ""Indian question"" in the USA: genocide and then deportation with compulsory Americanization for the children sent to normal American schools. Happy those who could go to some black school or academy. Most others were purely WASPed into total deculturation.We are finally coming out of it, at least mentally and we learn to look back at the horror of the end of the 19th century when the federal government cleaned up the plate and the table at the end of the wars. Still some skirmishes with some die-hard Indian tribes. They accepted to die for sure since they refused deportation but they did not die alone. The whites were not better: racist killers in the name of the law, blunt and blind murderers who did not care who they killed provided they were killed in the name of the eradication of the savages, the wild beasts, the Indians in one word and they were at least as gross and insolent and inhumane as that, probably and often more.I will not tell the story. It has to be experienced the way it comes on the screen. I will only say this film is bringing the idea of a possible renascence and reconciliation, what the Catholic church has been doing for nearly fifty years now. And it was made official and solemn in 1991: ""A Time for Remembering, Reconciling, and Recommitting Ourselves as a People Statement of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops on Native Americans November 1991."" Since then a lot of progress has been made. Some Protestant churches have followed. The Canadians went even further.In 2018 two Native Americans were elected to the House of Representatives: ""In Kansas, Democrat Sharice Davids became one of the first Native American women elected to the United States legislature; New Mexico's Deb Haaland became the other.""The main lesson is to understand that the only solution is empathy, is to feel the other in you and have the other feel you in themselves. The film says that we should not look back and we could disagree: we must not look back in nostalgia, regret, remorse or revenge, but we have to look back at the past and remember but with the objective of reconciling with the other side. No one can make up for the atrocities that were committed on both sides, even if on one side they defended their own land and ion the other side they appropriated Indian land for a symbolical penny, at times not even a farthing. But how can we step over this historical divide? Certainly not by mocking Pocahontas and keeping Pocahontas in the caricature we have reduced her to be, including in the Capitol Rotunda. Far from me the idea of asking for that painting to be taken away, but it is high time that another picture was displayed with a completely different image of Native Americans. By the way, one about slavery would also be a good thing, and that could bring the number of paintings to ten with these two additions.That miracle of being able to live beyond the horror of the past in communion with the other side, bringing together equals who are able to bury the dead of the other side the same way we bury ours and accept the homage from the other side. Sharing death is just as symbolical and strong as sharing life. But to share, it is definitely necessary not to be a supremacist of any kind. The film is maybe slightly too radical with the white supremacists at the end, though they sure deserve the treatment they get.This film is thus a call for stepping over past divides, past hatred, past hostilities, past conflicts and building a new world of harmony, discussion, exchange, and togetherness. We can today pull down the mental and psychological walls we have built between the various ethnic groups and cultural communities in our societies. I have often been called a black lover or even a N*** lover but I am proud of having supported the American Indian Movement in Wounded Knee, just as much as I supported Martin Luther King Junior and Angela Davis.We still have some way to go to finally fully share our common road and our common future.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Hostiles
34,zkonedog,A Different (And Refreshing) Take On The Western Genre,10,12 February 2018,"There is a reason why not too many western films come through Hollywood these days. Those types of stories peaked with the John Wayne and ""cowboys vs. Indians"" tales that proliferated both big screens and small in the 1950s and 60s. After nearly two decades of saturation, however, the genre--save for the rare ""Unforgiven"" here and there--had run its course. One way to revive it? Tell stories that are set in the American West, but come at things from a different point of view. That is exactly what ""Hostiles"" does, and to extraordinary effect, creating one of the finest Westerns ever put to film.For a very basic overview, ""Hostiles"" tells the story of Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) of the 1890s Union Army. Blocker, a man who has participated in numerous raids during the ""Indian Wars"" of that time period, is given the odd & unique task of escorting the dying Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) to his ancestral lands for his final days. At first extremely reticent about this task (as Blocker believes Yellow Hawk to be a savage butcher of men), the Captain is confronted with a number of scenarios along the way that make him view the struggle between U.S. citizens and Native Americans in a different light. Blocker also meets Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike) on the trail, a woman who further helps him (and he her) come to grips with life in such an unforgiving and time period.Hostiles is very much a nuanced western in the sense that nothing is black and white about it (no ""black hats"" versus ""white hats"" to be found here). More than perhaps any western I've ever seen, it throws convention aside to examine the concept of who the hostiles truly are in this struggle...the Natives or the white man. Western ""traditionalists"" may not like this deviation from the norm, but I found it extremely refreshing. Even in those harsher times, there had to have been men and women who struggled with this very issue. Such a perspective rarely gets examined, but director Scott Cooper shapes it perfectly.Even with the nuanced themes and characters, ""Hostiles"" is also one of the most visceral films I have ever seen. Within the first 2 minutes, you'll know exactly what I am talking about. This movie pulls no punches, whether it be its depiction of violence or even just the manner in which people interact with each other. While very dramatic in terms of presentation, there is very little ""Hollywood glam"" present here.In terms of acting, the role of Blocker seems to be one that Bale was born to play. Bale can convey more with a tortured facial expression that most actors can in an entire body of work, and that's exactly what is needed here to play a rather tortured soul. Matching him step-for-step is Pike, who herself covers a wide range of emotions from beginning to end.I came into ""Hostiles"" not really expecting much. Bale had underwhelmed me over the previous 4-5 years, while westerns themselves can be so hit-or-miss (even in the rare instance one does get green-lit). As such, I was utterly blown away to discover a movie so intense, yet one that covers such interesting and different materials and emotions than the western flicks of yesteryears. In all honesty, I'm surprised this film didn't garner any Academy Award nominations, as that is how impressive the entire project was. I have no reservations putting it toe to toe with the greatest the genre has to offer.",Hostiles
35,eddie_baggins,A new Western classic,10,9 December 2018,"In 2009 actor turned director Scott Cooper delivered a great debut film in the form of the Jeff Bridges starring country music themed Crazy Heart, but since then has struggled to enact upon his potential as a filmmaker with the fine yet forgettable Out of the Furnace and Black Mass, film's that promised a lot yet delivered only partly on their premises and name brand casts, that included the likes of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale.What a pleasure it is then to report that after the promise shown in year's past, Cooper has with his 2017 western Hostiles delivered a mesmerizing, emotionally charged and hauntingly beautiful examination of the end days of the American west, in a film that's lead by a powerhouse performance from Christian Bale and fantastic support from Gone Girl superstar Rosamund Pike.Proving once more that there's life yet in the well-worn and now oft-underused western genre, Hostiles is far from your typical adventure in the wilds of the early American landscape, a land that was filled with blood, mistrust and tension, as Cooper follows Bale's legendary Army captain Joseph Blocker as he and his comrades are forced to escort Wes Studi's dying Indian Chief Yellow Hawk and his family across the country back to their rightful lands, to live out a peaceable existence after an horrific yet captivating opening segment opens the film.Picking up Pike's traumatised widower Rosalee Quaid along the way, after Rosalee and her family were the victims of a terrible Indian attack on their homestead, Hostiles sets up a melting pot of emotions and feelings as the mismatched group of humans trek across the land and face more than their fair share of trials and tribulations to accomplish their initially simple objectives.Much like this seemingly simple set-up however, Hostiles will not be the film you think it to be as it takes its well planned and unpredictable turns to become a carefully and thoughtfully constructed examination of the human conditions as well as a timely reminder to what lay at the heart and soul of the American foundation.Filmed beautifully by DOP Masanobu Takayanagi (capturing this unforgiving yet stunning landscape with a fresh and captivating eye) and scored thoughtfully by famed The Leftovers composer Max Richter, Cooper's film becomes an all-round package of cinematic goodness that will leave you often feeling breathless and hypnotized by its execution.Front and centre of these happenings is Bale, who arguably delivered one of the turns of his esteemed career as Captain Blocker.A man we never get deep insights to, we know and understand that Blocker has seen and done things no man should have to live through and his relationships with both Chief Yellow Hawk, Rosalee's broken wife and mother and also Ben Foster's off-kilter soldier turned murderer that his company must also help deliver Philip Will's will mould and shape Blocker on his journey that becomes the heart and soul of Cooper's film.The best his been in years, Bale is supported by an on form ensemble that includes the likes of Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Timothée Chalamet and Adam Beach, while Pike is more than up to the task when required with her raw and heartfelt turn as good as anything she's ever done.Final Say -Hostiles is a sad and at times bleak film, an experience that at times will be tough to sit through but it's also a film filled with grace, mercy and importantly come its final frame a glimmer of hope.Cooper has with Hostiles crafted one of the finest westerns of the modern era that's delivered wondrously by his leading man.Undervalued by audiences and critics on its cinematic release in the United States during the crowded awards season rush, it's a mighty shame that Hostiles took so long to arrive on Australian cinema screens as Cooper's film is one of, if not the year's best films, and a fascinating look back at a time in American history many would rather forget.5 angry Hershel's out of 5",Hostiles
36,leonblackwood,Slightly Boring But Worth A Watch! 5/10,5,13 August 2018,"Review:
I wasn't a big fan of this movie because I found it quite slow and it seemed to go on forever but the storyline was quite emotional and the cinematography was spot on. I'm also not a big fan of the over-rated Christian Bale but he was the perfect choice for his role, mainly because he's moody throughout and I didn't see him crack a smile from the beginning to the end. Anyway, the film is set in 1892, were a loving family is destroyed when a Comanche war group kill Rosalee Quaid's 3 little children and her husband. Rosalee manages to escape from the ruthless Comanche tribe, by hiding in a small rock in the forest, and when she knows it's safe, she returns to her burnt down house, whilst holding her dead baby in her hands. Meanwhile, in Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Capt. Joseph J. Blocker (Christian Bale) is called into Col. Abraham Biggs (Stephen Lang) office, and he is given his last orders before he retires from the army. Biggs explains to Blocker that he is to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief, Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) back to the tribal lands in Montana, along with his family. As Yellow Hawk brutally murdered some of Blocker's war buddies, Blocker turns down the mission but when Biggs threatens to take away his pension and give him a court-martial, Blocker agree's to the mission. As the president has signed for the release of the prisoners, Blocker is forced to chaperone Yellow Hawk and his family with no mistakes but he is determined to make their journey as uncomfortable as possible. He puts together a unit to join their journey, who he orders to put chains on the 2 native men. Whilst on there journey, they come across Rosalee's burnt house, and they find her inside with her dead children. Blocker manages to convince her to join them on there journey, so they bury her children and then they head off to Montana. On their way, they are attacked by a Comanche tribe, which damages some of Blocker's unit. The rest of the film just follows them on their journey to Montana, where they come across more Comanches, and Blocker and Yellow Hawk finally gain each other's trust. When they finally get to Montana, Yellow Hawk dies of cancer, and while they are burying him, an American landowner threatens Blocker and the rest of his group, for burying an Indian on his land. After a severe gun battle, which results in most of Yellow Hawks family getting murdered, Blocker and Rosalee manage to survive, along with Little Bear, Yellow Hawks grandson. There are some touching moments which were quite emotional, and I like the root message about racism and class but I still found it a bit too long, and quite boring. It was good to see the different situations from both sides, and the concept is relevant to today, so from that point of view, it's worth a watch. With that aside, we have all been watching Cowboy & Indians movies since we were small, and although this has a deep message, it still seems the same as the black and white movies that were made decades ago, so don't expect an Oscar-winning film. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Scott Cooper, who also brought you the Oscar-winning Crazy Heart, Out Of The Furnace, which also starred Christian Bale, and Black Mass with Johnny Depp. He obviously has a versatile style of movies, which have all been successful at the box office but I wasn't that impressed with this film. After watching the bonus material, he made a point of making an authentic film, which stayed true to the period, which he successfully did but from an entertainment point of view, I won't be watching it again anytime soon. As for Christian Bale, his career has gone on a downhill slump since the Dark Knight but he's due to voice Bagheera in the new Mowgli movie which is due out in 2019, so his filmography will be getting a well-needed boost soon.Budget: $50million

It is a good revisionist western aided by top notch performance n lovely cinematography but lackluster direction, script n editing.Plot : Under threat of a court-martial and loss of his pension, an army officer reluctantly accepts the task of escorting a Cheyenne war chief and his family back to their native place.
The unwillingness of the officer ain't cos of the harsh terrain or the savages/scalpers or any other threat. It is cos the chief was responsible for the death of several soldiers.
The movie starts on a very tense n brutal note but goes a little downhill in the middle n ends in a typical western shootout.

39,paul-allaer,Worth checking out for Christian Bale's commanding performance,7,29 January 2018,"""Hostiles"" (2017 release; 133 min.) brings the story of Capt. Joe Blocker. As the movie opens, we see a farming family getting brutally attacked and murdered by a band of Apaches, only Rosalie, the wife, manages to escape and survive. We then switch to ""Fort Berringer, New Mexico 1892"", where we get to know Blocker, a veteran army captain with a deep anger, if not hate, for all Indian Natives. When his superior informs Blocker that he is, on direct orders of the President, to transport a dying Chief and his family all the way back to Valley of the Bears in Montana, Blocker reluctantly agrees, so as to stave off court martial. The group leaves Fort Berringer and soon after finds a dazed Rosalie, overcome with grief. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion between writer-director Scott Cooper and lead actor Christian Bale, who previously worked together on the excellent ""Out of the Furnace"" a few years ago (Cooper also brought us the equally excellent ""Black Mass""). In ""Hostiles"", Cooper brings us a slice of life in the Wild West's late 19th century. ""We'll never get used to the Lord's rough ways"", laments Rosalie at some point. The movie is in essence a Western road movie, as we catch the travails and troubles of the group making its way over the 1,000 mile trek. And boy, does trouble find them! Not that this should be considered an ""action"" movie, far from it. There are long stretches during which very little happens (and I don't mean this as a criticism-I just want to avoid anyone thinking this is an action movie).The movie is helped immensely by the towering performance from Christian Bale as the seasoned and weary army captain. Rosamund Pike is okay as the surviving widow. And it wasn't until the end credits were rolling that I realized one of Blecker's young soldiers is none other than Timothee Chalamet, who since then broke through in ""Call Me By Your name"" (for which he scored a Best Actor Oscar nomination). The photography of the majestic landscapes is pure eye-candy. Last but not least, the movie features a nice score, composed by the German-born British composer Max Richter which I plan on checking out as well.The movie finally expanded wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. You don't see this kind of movie made often anymore these days. Despite some uneven moments in the overall story, I quite liked the movie. If you are a fan of 'serious' Westerns or a fan of Christian Blake, I'd readily cuggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Hostiles
40,jtindahouse,A really good film that just can't quite find its way towards being great,7,25 December 2018,"'Hostiles' is basically a movie about the journey from hell. Everything that can go wrong does. It's a movie that I enjoyed, however I also felt could have been better in certain ways. The structuring of the film was bizarre to me. It never really gets a flow going. It feels like a situation arises, it is dealt with, and then we simply move onto another situation until that is dealt with too. Rinse and repeat for 134 minutes. I guess it's lucky that each of those situations is pretty interesting and well crafted, because the film remains very watchable.The cast in this movie is insanely good. Christian Bale in the lead role gives a performance for the ages. We knew he could be a hero based on his 'Batman' performances, but this was a character he had to create all on his own. He's very much a guy you want going into battle with you. The rest of the cast are almost equally terrific too. There isn't a weak performance amongst the bunch. It was a pleasant surprise to see New Zealand actress Robyn Malcolm make an appearance too with a pretty convincing accent I must say.The opening scene in 'Hostiles' is suspenseful and impactful. From there the film never lets up. The flow might not be consistent, but the quality of the action always is. It's a beautiful film to look at too. The only real criticism I would have is that the film never really dares to be great. It never has that one moment or scene that will stick with an audience for a long time to come. Still though, 'Hostiles' is an above average film very much worth your time.",Hostiles

This is a western-A genre that I happen to be quite fond of when they are done well-that is actually pretty good. The only problem I might mention is that it was a little slow, in parts. Otherwise, I liked it. Christian plays an Army Captain in 1892 that has a reputation as an Indian fighter and he is getting close to his retirement. Well, guess what? His boss wants him to escort a Cheyenne Chief, Wes, to Montana so that the chief can die in his own homeland-he has cancer. Of course, Indian hater Christian refuses but his boss-like lots of bosses-is ruthless and wants things done his way or it's the highway, so he threatens Christian's pension if he doesn't do the job. Christian saddles up for the long journey and picks up a few strays along the way; Rosamund, who lost her entire family to a Comanche raiding party, and Ben, an Army soldier accused of a crime and being transferred to a nearby fort for hanging. Rosamund is a bit traumatized from the attack on her family at the farmhouse so she is not too happy to see Wes riding with Christian's group. Ben thinks he should be set free, since he is an innocent man and didn't do anything wrong. Christian knows that it's not going to be an easy road trip.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes.

42,tadpole-596-918256,It's said that all it takes to spoil the melting pot . . .,8,17 January 2018,". . . is one bad apple, so HOSTILES is as American as apple pie. The premise of HOSTILES is that our nation is doomed when its inhabitants refuse to assimilate. HOSTILES' argument is based upon sound scientific proof. Modern-day blood tests have revealed that Earth's current human population averages about 3% Neanderthal in its genetic make-up, but how many ""pure blood"" cavemen have you seen ordering lattes at your local Starbucks recently? As the conclusion of HOSTILES illustrates, inter-breeding is the quickest and surest way for Humanity to absorb its so-called ""outlier"" communities. When a subset of the Happy Whole stubbornly clings to its own, private quaint but inefficient ancestral foods, languages, and burial customs, all Hell is bound to break loose. A totally unnecessary joy ride from New Mexico to Montana dominates the story told in HOSTILES, singling out the exact pitfalls of the ""cultural"" Achilles Heels listed above. HOTILES dares viewers to ponder whether it's ever permissible to allow a sub-group to dig in its heels, and refuse to integrate onto the winning team for century after century, while maintaining a supercilious ""holier than thou"" chip on its collective shoulder.",Hostiles
43,st-shot,Massacre along the PC trail.,4,27 January 2018,"Referencing DH Lawrence at the outset Hostiles continues the Hollywood trend (Suburbicon, The Shape of Water) to blame the caucasian male for everything that seems to be terrible in American history, real or otherwise. There's an opening slaughter of homesteaders by a marauding band of Commanches but by the last reel it is overwhelmingly clear who the monsters are after two interchangeable groups of surly Euros along with a guilt ridden trooper apologizing for the white man's misdeeds blot the screen with their miscreant ways. In its attempt to be ""even handed"" it takes a side.Veteran Indian fighter Captain Blocker (Christian Bale) is assigned to take ailing Chief Yellow Hawk back to his homeland in Montana. The stoic Blocker, an heroic racist balks at first but is given little option. Once along the uneasy trail conflict and camaraderie mingle. Stuck in a funk from start to finish Hostiles is more saunter than gallop as our morose and taciturn band of uneasy riders make their way across the breathtakingly stunning landscape of North American wilderness. Spending more time burying people than communicating director Scott Cooper keeps the meter running as he wastes time with endless close-ups and pregnant pauses that more or less examine the same issue repetively. Without an ounce of comic relief Hostiles simply strings along one tragedy after the next as writer director Cooper sluggishly attempts to nuance his irony of civilized savage versus noble Native American. Note: An ideal antidote for this mawkish work is Ulzana's Raid (1972) directed by Richard Fleischer and featuring Burt Lancaster. Dealing with a similar issue it is far more honest and coldly objective. Plus Burt does not have much time to reflect or shed a tear like Bale does a couple of time in Hostiles; he's too busy trying to keep his hair.",Hostiles

The movie has a quite slow pace, so don't expect a vivid American or Italian western from the fifties and sixties. This movie is a drama above all, situated in a historically intriguing period between the American Civil War and the emergency of the Industrial Revolution.The story revolves around Captain Joseph Blocker, who has lost many friends and brothers in arms in battles against Apaches and who openly despises them. He tracks them down pitilessly and tells himself that he is doing his duty while people around him start becoming depressed and disillusioned. One day, a colonel gives him a final order before his retirement,direct from the President. Joseph Blocker must escort a dying Cheyenne Chief, his personal arch enemy, as well as his family back to their tribal lands as a sign of reconciliation with the First Nations. The captain, who has always obeyed orders, is about to refuse but is menaced and forced to cooperate. He gathers a few faithful brothers in arms and must also cooperate with some inexperienced rookies around him to go on this dangerous trip. On the way from New Mexico to Montana, the unusual group faces numerous challenges as they face difficult weather conditions, a hostile Comanche party and racist landowners among others. They are joined by numerous other intriguing characters such as a mentally unstable woman who has lost her entire family to the Apaches and a former brother in arms of the captain who is about to be hanged. However, their biggest challenge is to fight their inner demons and overcome their differences in order to survive in hostile territory.The movie finds the right balance between violent sequences that focus on the witnesses' reactions rather than graphic elements and clever dialogues between the diversified cast of characters. The most fascinating character is Captain Joseph Blocker, who seems to be a pitiless racist at first sight but who turns out to be a man with a strong moral compass who goes through a coming-of-age on this fateful journey and ends up not only forgiving the Indians for killing his partners but even empathizing and sympathizing with them, ending up defending them beyond duty. His positive development exemplifies the difficult relationship between European settlers and America's First Nations and is ultimately a sign of forgiveness, hope and peace. This positive moral contrasts the quite sinsiter mood of the film with an elevated body count and sensitive topics such as depression, revenge and suicide as many characters shatter under the burden of the challenging order.Hostiles is a film that needs some patience and time to unfold but ends up being particularly rewarding thanks to the strong moral behind the sinister mask. Christian Bale, one of the world's greatest actors, even delivers the best performance of his career as tough anti-hero with just as many flaws as strengths. Above all, Hostiles is a film that is profoundly human, in all its sickening darkness interrupted by some rays of light. The perfect ending exemplifies this mixture perfectly. Western and drama fans should experience this film at the cinema and fans of Christian Bale just can't get around this movie either. Hollywood should produce more westerns and less superhero movies.",Hostiles

Elements of The Searchers, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven and Heavens Gate intersect to create a film which has a story of its own.1892, Christian Bale is a US Calvary Captain on the verge of retirement who is coerced into bringing the fatally ill Chief Yellow Knife (Wes Studl) and his family home to Montana to die. Along the way he encounters a woman (Rosamund Pike) whose family has been slain by Comanches. Pike is not merely a victim and proves to be a fighter as well as a source of stability for Bale.Bale is an Indian fighter who has a past history with Yellow Knife as have his Sergeant (Rory Cochrane) and Corporal (Jonathan Majors). The three soldiers have worked together for years, are like brothers and work as a team with little need for communication. Bale and Cochrane in particular are suffering traumas from years violence and killing, Coming under attack from the Comanches, fur trappers, a prisoner and ranchers, Bale realises that he has to rely on Yellow Knife for support. 8/10.",Hostiles
49,dworldeater,Great modern western,8,7 June 2018,"Hostiles is a very sharp looking and at times pretty brutal modern western. Christian Bale is outstanding as the lead and central character, which almost goes without saying as even in movies that are pretty bad(Terminator Salvation), his performance is still excellent. The film is used as a metaphor for the current social landscape of America with regards to racism and how a little education and understanding can change people's perspectives. Hostiles, does not beat the audience over the head with the issue and similar themes have been explored in films before. This film has a lot in common with The Last Samurai in that regard and like that film, this is also very entertaining and well made. Even, if one chooses to ignore those themes, I doubt fans of the western will be disappointed with this picture. Wes Studi and Adam Beach are excellent as the native Americans that Bale is to accompany on their home to Montana. I was pretty impressed and entertained by Hostiles and I hope that more westerns of similar quality get wide theatrical releases.",Hostiles
50,valleyjohn,Great acting but hard to watch.,7,11 January 2018,"Since the beginning of movie making the story of the native Indian and their struggle with the white American ( or visa versa) has been told verbatim but I haven't seen any that focus on the emotional and mental impact of the death and distruction that surrounds both sets of people .That is until now.
This this the story of army captain Joseph J. Blocker who undertakes one final mission before retirement. To escort Yellow Hawk , a dying Cheyenne war chief - and his family back to sacred tribal lands. Together they battle against the brutality of men , coming to the rescue of a young widow amidst the carnage of her murdered family. On the journey the two men have to learn to trust one another despite their history.
To say this film is a little bit grim is to say The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a little bit gory.
At times this film is so dark it's difficult to watch. The mental torture these characters endure due to their grieving hits you full in the face.
Christian Bale is fantastic as is Wes Studi and Rosamund Pike and it cannot have been an easy film to make.
If you are looking for an all action traditional western this is not it. It's what people would call a modern western and while I enjoyed the performances ; i can't say the film , because of it's content , was enjoyable. 
In fact I would say Hostiles was very hard work .",Hostiles
51,truemythmedia,A Rough but Rewarding Journey,8,7 June 2019,"Cooper had proven himself as a competent director, but he wasn't a director whose work I waited for on bated breath. Upon seeing the trailer for ""Hostiles"", I thought the film looked as if would have a tone much like Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace, intentionally slow with sporadic but savage violence peppered throughout. I was only half-right in my thinking. ""Hostiles"" is slow, true, but its pacing is much better than both ""Heart"" and ""Furnace"" (about on par with ""Black Mass""). Overall, I found Hostiles to be my personal favorite of Coopers films. It is not without it's flaws, but few movies truly are. ""Hostiles"", when taken at face value, is a brutal look at the dying American west; it's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and a fierce journey to travel.",Hostiles

55,rgkarim,"A Depressing Lesson Of Morals, With A Hostile, Slow, Story",6,27 January 2018,"Award nominated movies get so much hype this time of the year, praised by critics and users alike. However, depending on your tastes, these films are much slower, deeper, and less entertaining than the traditional blockbuster that floods the theater. And this week, the general release of Hostiles starring Rosamund Pike and Christian Bale hits the theaters. Seeing a Western mosey into the theaters again, I had high hopes for this movie shining like the awards suggested it would. What is the verdict? Robbie K is back in the dark trenches to give you his thoughts on yet another film piece. Let's get started. LIKES:The Cinematography/Setting: One thing this movie has going for it, is being shot out in the wilderness frontier. Hostiles is a beautiful display of this beautiful country, jam packed with jaw dropping spectacles of the Midwestern Plains. Dynamic angles and multiple setting help bring you into the theme of the Wild Wild West and get integrated into the world. And given that this story involves a lot of walking, it's good to have this cinematography supporting the treks of our wandering band of travelers. The Acting: You can tell I appreciate good performances, and Hostiles have an aggressive performance that is indeed Oscar worthy. With Bale as the leading name, this former vigilante moves from Gotham City to the historical forts of the 19th century. His rough edge works well as a disgruntled, tortured Civil War captain, bringing that hurt out in his steel gaze and tempered delivery. Heroic and honor still dwell in the character, and Bale is able to keep all these pieces aligned to craft the interesting character. As for Pike, her character at first was annoying, but they bounced back and crafted an incredible, resilient warrior whose layers extended past the traumatic dismay of her story. All the supporting characters of military personnel and Native American families were top notch, though their characters dialogue and roles were limited and not as fleshed out. The Culture/Messages: Hostiles is definitely Oscar worthy in terms of the cultural representation contained in this movie. This time of adventure was certainly exciting, but perhaps one of the hardest times due to all the hostility the country was in. Hostiles visualizes that environment quite well, bringing a realistic portrayal of this struggle and how life is so fragile. However, amidst all the traditions, violence, and hate, there are rays of light that attempt to outshine the darkness/hate. Hostiles representation of forgiveness, honor, courage, and Native American tradition and the artistic presentation is solid and less preachy than some other tales. Such strong lessons in lessons in an emotionally charged portrayal will hopefully hit you deep down. The Music: These movies are often known for their musical scores, and Hostiles is another grand example of symphony magic. Amidst all the traditions, dense dialogue, and savagery is a fantastic score that adds to the emotions of each scene. Brass instruments lead the charge of the battles, while delicate woodwinds add tranquility to the more peaceful parts. Yet it's the final scene of the movie that holds my favorite track, a combination of everything to bring that film to an emotion packed ending. DISLIKES:Depressing: I like movies with a darker plot, it allows for more options and a dynamic story that is less predictable. However, I'm not a fan of movies that are terminally depressing, no matter how educational they may be. Hostiles will leave you down and exhausted with everything that transpires, primarily in the Game of Thrones like atmosphere that hangs over the traveling band. Don't expect to keep your spirits bright at the end of this film friends, because there isn't much happiness to gleam. Long: The movie is only over two hours long, but to this reviewer it felt more like four hours. Hostiles is a movie that has a lot of challenges to develop our characters, but it was not an exciting journey for me to be honest. While this one felt more like a traditional Western film, the movie failed to integrate much excitement for me to get it going. There were a couple of suspenseful battles in the mix, but the movie resorts to walking through the woods and drama more than anything. Had the story been more engaging, this would have worked, but that even failed to impress me outside of the morals it taught. Given these limitations for me, this movie could have delivered the same messages in half the time. So, bottom line, movie is long and not that entertaining to the traditional crowd. Story Editing: The underlying message to this movie is the development of Bale's character in breaking open the hard-edged soldier and revealing the human beneath. Sadly, the way they go for this, while artistic, was convoluted, sporadic, and kind of pointless. The opening act held potential in the thrilling hike through the wilderness with a hostile enemy in pursuit. However, this component is dropped and a new tangent is introduced. The movie continues this trend and the writers seemed to throw these random, convenient moments in the mix to try to stir things up. These disjointed plot devices, didn't flow well with me, and these sudden character introductions were lazy without any mention in proceeding conversations. Even the dialogue is mediocre, accurate to the time period, but low amplitude and containing little pertinent details. And when they get to the more emotional moments, they are reduced to quick montages that are over in a pinch. As for the ending when the final journey is reached, that final conflict was a messy end that was hastily developed and not really worthwhile in the grand scheme. The Verdict: Hostiles is again one of those time period movies that holds much realism in the forests and frontier of the West. The visuals take center stage on this movie, with acting and moral lessons granting an excuse for a big budge stroll through the wilderness. However, this true Western is very drawn out, with heavy handed drama that is depressing and savage in its own right. In addition, the disjointed story does not help support these darker moments for me to give major credit outside of symbolic representation of fighting the demons we all battle. So, while this movie is artistic, thought provoking, and realistic, it's also not as entertaining as I like in a film. Therefore, I can't recommend this one for theaters and encourage a visit at home theater to be honest. My scores:Adventure/Drama/Western: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0",Hostiles
56,krocheav,Hostiles - A Challenging Entertainment,8,13 April 2019,"Hostiles just might be one of the better resent productions within the Western genre - the story offers both powerful emotions and excitement. Performances are first class, music and photography are highly impressive, with settings being both rugged and stunning. If anything might occasionally hold it back it could be that direction has a tendency to take itself a touch too seriously - while at the same time, also being impressive. The script shows a sharp perception of the times, situations and politics that permeated and shaped the early west for the better or worse. The opening massacre of the pioneer family seemed reminiscent of the similar situation presented in 'Jeremiah Johnston' and the aftermath also followed in a similar style. The graphic details leave no doubt as to the severity of these incidents and the profound impact on any who may happen to survive.
The script at some points tends to wander unevenly, hinting at possible rewrites or post-production changes - leaving one or two occurrences a little short on clarification. Within the deliberately pensive pace - viewers need to listen carefully to dialogue lest you miss a vital clue. There's both contempt and respect for Indian and White Man shown throughout this semi-epic story - based on an earlier writing of the late scriptwriter, Donald E. Stewart (Missing '82). Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart '09) has adapted Stewart's original manuscript, moulding and expanding on ideas. Respect for the native Indian tongue is evident but at times, was lacking in subtitles to allow the rest of us to know what was being said - perhaps that's carrying 'realism' a touch too far. The ending will either work well or leave you hesitant, depending on your preferences toward the situation. This expensive production will need sales help from Cable, DVD, etc, to supplement its mild profits.",Hostiles
57,MR_Heraclius,Great,8,23 February 2020,"Christian Bale is absolutely tremendous, delivering a quietly intense performance in this brutal revisionist Western that carefully (yet incisively) examines the consequences of a merciless cycle of hatred that only dehumanizes people and turns them into beasts and monsters.",Hostiles

'Hostiles' is another solid classic-style Western - slow-moving, atmospheric, and character-oriented. It ticks all the boxes for fans of the genre.An explosive and dramatic opening sets up the story nicely and it held my interest throughout - not always the case with longer films. The film looks great, it is beautifully shot and the cinematography is impressive.

Let's hope they continue making films like this.",Hostiles
59,maurice_yacowar,Army captain and widow survive savagery to find new hope,8,28 January 2018,"This classic Western dramatizes its opening quotation from D.H. Lawrence: ""The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer. It has never yet melted."" 
 Trump's America shows no sign of its having melted yet. On the contrary, that racist, violent soul-less ""soul"" now holds sway. And yet, pockets of the true, great America, the land of equality, freedom and community, persist. And so does the nation's hope for redemption. 
 Writer/director Scott Cooper avoids any comfort of partisanship. If the racist, murderous rancher at the end represents the extreme of the Republicans, the simple-minded, cliched Harper's journalist/photographer at the beginning represents - and equally diminishes - the naive ""useful idiots"" on the Left, aka the Democrats. The preferable idealist is the fort commander's wife, who at the dinner table articulates her anger at the government's abuse of the Native American - but even she is here insensitive to her guest Rosalie's trauma.
 The world-weary hero Captain Blocker has the bloodied hands and traumatized memory of the true soldier, but he reads Julius Caesar in Latin. With a leap of humanity and trust he bestows the book on the little Indian orphan about to start a new life in the paleface Chicago. 
 Unusually for the genre, there are no religious figures. The Bible is read over the white people's burials and the Native American rites are respected for theirs. But there are no church people. Without religious institutions, faith operates strictly on the personal level. Rosalie and Blocker both believe in God. As Rosalie, who moves from seeing her family slaughtered by Indians to being raped by white trappers, admits: ""If I did not have faith, what would I have?""
 Rosalie's essential faith is not based on any church or God but in the recognition of common humanity. Her initial hatred of the ""Redskins"" (Washington NFL fans take note) grows from reflexive hysteria and hunger for revenge to her sense of shared vulnerability. She's touched when the Indian woman gives her a dress. Ultimately Rosalie will pick up a rifle to defend the Apaches against the white landowner. 
 This softening, this advent of empathy, grows out of life experience, either despite our through the suffering that drives people apart. After all, the title ""Hostiles"" refers to the entire rainbow of cultures in this film. Thus Rosalie: ""Sometimes I envy the finality of death. The certainty. And I have to drive those thoughts away when I wake."" To carry on, we have to carry on, preferring the challenges and complexities of life over any relief from our mortality. 
 Blocker is the central moral barometer. As a soldier he has had to suspend his moral conscience: ""I've killed everything that's walked or crawled. If you do it enough, you get used to it."" He begins so full of hatred that he refuses the assignment to escort the murderous Apache chief home to die. As he gets to know him, however, he comes to appreciate the old enemy's character and dignity. 
 It is possible to accept an enemy, by acknowledging his humanity. Difficult, but possible, in the face of our moral clashes. Blocker knows that the bigotry and violence inbred in our world preclude any easy freedom for anyone: ""Understand this: When we lay our heads down here, we're all prisoners."" 
 That grows ever clearer as the battles - mental as well as physical - shrink Blocker's troupe. The last scene suggests Blocker might be the Cain figure, the cursed killer doomed to rootlessness, forbidden community. That's the typical American outlaw hero - Shane, Ethan Edwards (of The Searchers), Tom Doniphan (the man who really shot Liberty Valance) and so on. Society needs that killer in order to survive but cannot accommodate or accept him if it is to claim to be civilized. 
 As he bids Rosalie and the boy goodbye Blocker seems to feel disqualified from happiness, from love, from a normal family life. But as the train pulls away he leaps on. He has rejected the finality of damnation and death, has shucked the shackles of his murderous career, and in an act of true faith resolves to join Rosalie for Chicago. 
 As the film opens with Rosalie losing her first family, it ends with her assumption of a new one. Rosalie, Blocker and the boy now have a new love and self-respect forged in the heat of the brutality and savagery they have suffered, yet managed to keep their humanity intact.",Hostiles

62,bettycjung,Western road trip on horses,7,4 February 2018,"2/4/18. Saw this in the theater. Great scenery, though a bit slow (as in molasses) to get the story across. But, stay with it for the satisfying ending. Think of this as a western road trip on horses. As far as westerns go, this is about the right pace. Bale plays a duty-bound officer tasked to take an Indian chief and his family in Arizona back to their Montana home so he could die in familiar surroundings. Along the way you get to see the usual hazards of the 1890s, unfriendly Indians, fur-trappers of questionable morals, a family destroyed by frontier barbarism, and a growing understanding among the travelers on the trip. Perhaps, it is just Hollywood trying to make amends for how Native Americans were treated by the Whites of the day. And, that's fine. Bale and Pike were excellent, as were the supporting cast. Almost gives you a good reason re-explore this genre.",Hostiles
63,jon.h.ochiai,Let hate die,10,3 January 2018,"""Hostiles"" is sublime. Hatred dies in mortality and forgiveness in Writer and Director Scott Cooper's ""Hostiles"". Christian Bale is powerful in his humanity. Rosamund Pike is poignant resilience and loss. Cooper's images and narrative will move and touch your soul.Rosamund Pike as young mother Mrs. Quaid cries in anguish as she digs with her bare hands the graves for her three children murdered by Apache Indians. While silent compassionate Christian Bale as Captain Joe Blocker watches with his men ready to aid the distraught widow. Mrs. Quaid is a woman of God, of faith. Without her faith what does she have? The scene broke my heart in tears. Bad things can occur under God's watch. Writers Cooper and Donald E. Steward don't shy away for the world's seeming unkindness and unfairness. Cooper balances the ugliness and the beauty of courage and redemption in ""Hostiles"". Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi elegantly captures the lightness and darkness. Darkness is in Blocker's merciless vengeance upon those who harmed the people he cares for on the stormy night. Lightness radiates as his party emerges on horseback riding through the sunlit forest. Poetry is in the balance. As the singular Western, ""Hostiles"" is one of best ever, even compared to Clint Eastwood's iconic ""Unforgiven"". I think more so. Whereas, ""Unforgiven"" surrenders to the hollow emptiness, ""Hostiles"" asks to release hatred. Bale's Blocker is a killer of Indians, a racist, and prejudiced. What if all prejudice can be justified? Blocker realizes that his mortal enemy Cheyenne Chief Yellow Hawk, played by noble Wes Studi, would have slaughtered as he did, all for the sake of being right. You can take being right to the grave. In the end, being right makes absolutely no difference. That is the eloquence of ""Hostiles"". ""Hostiles"" invites to think from your soul. Sitting on the grassy plains Mrs. Quaid asks, ""You believe in the Lord, Joseph?"" Blocker replies, ""Yes. I do. But he's been blind to what 's been going on here for a long time."" ""Hostiles"" inspires having faith knowing that the world is gray and cruel at times. Set in New Mexico in 1892 retiring US Calvary Captain Joe Blocker, played by Bale, is commanded by his Colonel to escort Cheyenne Chief Yellow Hawk, played by Studi, and his family to his homeland in Montana. Yellow Hawk is now an old man dying of cancer. Blocker is transparent, ""I hate him."" Blocker's unique gift is killing tribal Indian warriors. He's taken more scalps than Sitting Bull. In their younger days Yellow Hawk and his men heinously murdered Blocker's dearest soldier friends. In kind Blocker brutally killed the Cheyenne. Each believing that he was in the right. For unmarried Joseph doing ""his job"" is his only purpose. Mortal enemies Blocker and the Chief define each other. Their telling exchanges in Cheyenne have the gravitas of honor and mortality. On the journey, Blocker and his men rescue broken Mrs. Quaid, played by Pike, in the aftermath of the murder of her entire family. Blocker reveals his gentleness as he reaches out his hand, ""I'm not going to hurt you."" Their journey is treacherous and costly. Alliances alter and reinvent. Find courage and faith in the hopeless. Discover one's redemption and forgiveness. Christian Bale is at his best. He fearlessly explores what it is to be human. Whether he exacts violent revenge upon the villain or cries ""You never let me down."" to his dear friend Henry, played by Jonathan Majors, he surrenders to humanity in all its shades. He provides beautiful partnership with Rosamund Pike's Mrs. Quaid in her touching sadness and possibility of renewed life. Pike is vulnerable and powerful. Western ""Hostiles"" has a lot to say for us today. There will always be hatred and prejudice. They are about being right and making others wrong. What Bale's Joseph discovers when he looks for balance: Righteousness and hatred only causes suffering. Maybe we can't love everyone. Maybe one thing we can do is let go of hate. Let hate die. ""Hostiles"" is my favorite movie of the year.",Hostiles
64,RforFilm,Hostiles has some pretty cinematography and some good story elements. It's too bad the dry and slow tone drag the revisionist tale of Native American prejudice,6,29 January 2018,"Living with our mistakes can be a difficult thing to do. We have all made at least one decision that we come to regret so much that we would do anything to go back in time and reverse that. For most, this has involved hurting someone. Perhaps this was intentional or even doing something you thought was good until something happens that made you think otherwise. We hate to think ourselves as imperfect, but humanity is all about the constant wrestle with our freewill and what comes with it. I hate to think that I've caused pain, but I cannot deny that I've done things that I wish could have been different.The mistakes of the past can be dealt with...even if that doesn't erase them. The people you've hurt may not even forgive you. What's also hard to accept is that not everyone is willing to accept you. But when you accept that you don't need their ""acceptance"", you have every chance to make yourself a good person. This is why if your going to move forward with a better idea about how to help, then we can learn where we went wrong before. One such guy tries to redeem himself in the Old West in Hostiles.In 1892 at Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Captain Joseph Blocker (played by Christian Bale) has returned after recapturing an Apache family that was attempting escape. He's told that for his last assignment before discharge that he has to relocate a Cheyenne war chief and his family up north to Montana. Blocker tries to decline the job, but is told that this is a direct order from the president and that if he doesn't, then he'll be court marshaled. So he agrees for the sake of his pension, but is also allowed to select his detail. He also meets the family he's transporting, war chief Yellow Hawk, his son Black Hawk, other son Moon Deer, Daughter-in-law Elk Woman, and grandson Little Bear.While heading up, they encounter a woman Rosalie (played by Rosamund Pike) who has just experienced an Indian attack on her ranch where her husband and three children had been killed and scalped. After they bury the family, Rosaline joins the detail. Though Blocker is still reluctant to go up north due to his prejudices, he's impressed with Yellow Hawk's willingness to fight off other tribes that attack. The further north they get, the more Blocker thinks about what he's done and what it's meant to Native Americans. Looking at the west with a revisionist viewpoint is nothing new (Dances with Wolves is probably the best example), so Hostiles better offer something new. While I can't say it does, it does try to make it's characters interesting. Story wise, I like the journey this solider, his detail, and the Indians are going for. New Mexico to Montana is a long ride. It surprises me that for a story that's trying to question ""Whose the savage"", it's focus is very uneven. The script for Hostiles has a lot of ambition of juggling it's characters and the arcs they go through. Some like of Rosaline and Yellow Hawk are fascinating, but what troubles me is of the main character. He too goes through a change, but it feels buried, like it happened off screen and we didn't get a chance to see most of it. I think the movie was trying to write a lot of these characters similar to Game of Thrones where they could die at any minute. It doesn't help that much of the dialogue is very dry, which seems more real, but often had me losing focus and even daydreaming. So you'd think that I didn't like Hostiles. Well... it's still a well-made movie. The cinematography is nice and captures the open plains and forests beautifully. The west is easy to make beautiful, so you need to have a strong script to go with it. I'd say that with a passable script, it's good, but not great. It was written and directed by Scott Cooper (Out of the Furnace, Black Mass) whose known for trying to make the material of his stories as realistic as possible. The problem is that aside from being dry, they tend to be subjects that have been tackled before.I'll give this six Cheyenne souvenirs out of ten. Hostiles was fine to watch on the big screen (we rarely get westerns, so their always going to be a nice relief). It even had some interesting stories, but it's a shame that not all of it works. If you like westerns, then you'll probably find this passable. It's overlong though and could have used a half hour cut to at least help some of the dry tone. Id say that if this is your cup of tea, take this ride into the sunset.",Hostiles
65,juliankennedy23,Christian Bale is fantastic,9,15 October 2018,"Hostiles: 9 out of 10: A cavalry officer (Christian Bale) escorts a dying Cheyenne chief (Wes Studi) and his family to his native burial grounds. On the way, they meet a woman (Rosamund Pike) who has just lost her family to violence. The Good: Christian Bale is fantastic in this film. Not just solid (like the rest of the cast) but out and out fantastic. This is really one of the best performances I have ever seen by any actor. The rest of the cast are no slouches either. Rosamund Pike, in particular, brings some gravitas and grief to a role that could have easily gone sideways. The film is beautifully shot. Almost too good looking. It seems that Bale's character chooses a route based on the number of picture-postcard vistas.
The Bad: You have seen this story before. A lot. The acting and cinematography bring it to a new level but this is a straight retelling of a very old tale. The movie also takes its time. Not as bad as one might think but there is definitely a slow steady pace interrupted by violence. The Ugly: This is not a cheerful feel-good film. While I enjoyed myself I certainly understand how others might find it tough sledding.In Conclusion: A little while ago I saw the Tommy Lee Jones directed ""The Homesman"" starring himself, Hillary Swank and Meryl Streep of all people. It told a similar story to Hostiles. It wasn't very good. The Homesman knew it was a western and as such told a tale meant perhaps as an allegory. It was a tool for people to overact (Jones in particular) while the director (Jones again) kept filming the horizon as if it had never been filmed before. I find the modern western is often a minefield of good intentions, beautiful vistas, and often boring cliched storytelling. Hostiles feels as if it doesn't know it is a movie. The characters seem like real people dealing with real situations the best they can. There is nothing fundamental in the story that makes this film special. In poorer hands with a journeyman director and Mark Wahlberg in the Christain Bale role, it would be a cliched mess. Christian Bale commits fully to the role and carries the film on his back. He makes it over the finish line without even breaking a sweat.",Hostiles

67,Blue-Grotto,Hostiles Come From Anywhere,6,30 September 2017,"Deep and long simmering hatred is stirred up when Captain Blocker, an experienced and capable yet bitter western war veteran, is ordered to lead the transfer of a small band of Cheyenne from New Mexico to Montana. Blocker is enraged because the band includes Yellow Hawk, the killer of his friends. Forced to go, Blocker puts Yellow Hawk in chains for the long ride. The unlikely travel companions meet up with a grief-stricken woman in the burnt remains of her home. She cradles a dead baby in her arms and hovers on the brink of insanity. Worse, the unstable and dangerous men who massacred the woman's family are now on their trail. Sympathy for the woman as well as the desire for self-preservation begins to unite the Cheyenne and the soldiers.There are wonderful film themes to digest including the understanding that hostility can come from anywhere or anyone. We are all potential hostiles. It is a sight for sore eyes to watch the characters travel through beautiful prairies and wildlands. Actors including Chistian Bale, Wes Studi and Rosamund Pike, perform impressively. While the actor chemistry is a bit off and much time is wasted in useless blubbering, there is an uncommon, important and intriguing American history lesson here.

The film then goes straight into a violent action scene where we see a rancher and his children are murdered by a band of Comanche, the horses are led away but the (now) widow escapes. At this point Christian Bale's character (Capt. Blocker) is introduced, he is a legendary army captain, who has just been given a mission to escort an old Indian chief and his family back home across the desolate challenging landscape.Blocker is initially reluctant, he has a bad history with the native Indians, and the chief who is dying of cancer is a longstanding adversary. However, the mission has come directly from the President and he is further threatened with the loss of his pension if he refuses.Rollercoaster brutal action interspersed with quiet thoughtful set-pieces, where a lot is depicted with very few words.

71,MrDHWong,An interesting character study for just about everyone involved,8,10 May 2018,"Hostiles is a Western film starring Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, and Wes Studi. Written and directed by Scott Cooper (Black Mass, Crazy Heart), it is a well-made but unrelenting film about one's own moral judgement and survival of the obstacles that life throws in their way.In 1892 in New Mexico, Captain Joe Blocker (Christian Bale) is tasked with escorting a native American chief (Wes Studi) and his family across state lines to their homeland in Montana. Along the way, Blocker's group discover a traumatised housewife named Rosalee (Rosamund Pike), whose husband and children were brutally murdered by a nearby native war tribe. After some gentle coaxing, Rosalee joins the group and they set off once again, navigating through the dangerous terrain and environment.While it does occasionally drag in some scenes and is not as epic as it wishes to be, Hostiles is a solid Western and an interesting character study for just about everyone involved. Almost everybody's moral compass is on full display and the viewer benefits greatly from seeing the ways in which someone wrestles with their humanity and actions. Christian Bale does an excellent job leading the film and his character is superbly written, constantly questioning his own behaviour and self-restraint. Director Scott Cooper makes great use of the landscape to showcase the open and hostile environment of the old American West, almost as though it is character in its own right. Even though I feel that the film could have been considered a modern classic if some of its flaws were ironed out, Cooper has still made a film well worth seeing at least once due to its interesting characters and creative use of cinematography.I rate it 7.5/10",Hostiles
72,Alexander_Blanchett,Mediocre,6,21 May 2018,"I was expecting a lot from the film, especially because of the premises and cast. The result is a further proof that the Western genre is probably just nor really my kind of thing. The story was interesting to some points but I just failed to relate to the characters.
The acting was fine. Christian Bale gives a very believable and routined performance. He totally fit the films sorroundings and gave us a controlled portrayal of broken veteran who more or less allies with his enemy to fight a combined enemy. Rosamund Pike is pretty good as well. It would have been great to see further development of her character but nevertheless she gave a memorable turn. I really liked Wes Study who might have been the MVP of the film. Nice to see Timothée Chalamet a pretty decent Jesse Plemons. The score wa good and also was the overall look of the film. I just didn't think Scott Cooper's direction was inspired enough to keep my attention through out he entire film.
Its worth to see for the elements mentioned above, but for a film that was once considered a major Oscar candidate I really hoped for more, in the end is was a decent and routined film but really nothing groundbreaking at all.",Hostiles
73,statuskuo,Like What The Title Says,8,29 December 2017,"""Hostiles"" is a brutal ugly film in one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It makes you wonder how close to animals we really are.
This is ""The Defiant Ones"" taken to the next level. Where a mean S.O.B. has to take another mean S.O.B. to die of cancer in his home land. You'll recall many foreign lands have a policy to release terrorist to die in their native land. Outrage ensues. But that's what Christian Bale's Joe Blocker has to do with Wes Studi's Chief Yellow Hawk and his family. This trek obviously won't be for the squeamish,The film is a lot about PTSD. The inhumanity in war causes a deep ridge against you as a function civil human. Whatever justification to move onto life, that is what you must hold onto. Along the way, we see a woman who has suffered great tragedy, Rosalie Quaid who is witness to the frontier's harsh reality. Dogged, by what is considered criminal in life, is excusable in battle. Now it haunts Blocker at every step. Including men who saw the true man he is. Very close to ""Unforgiven"" and much in the tone of ""Cold Mountain"" this is about reconnecting with humanity. It will feel removed from some of the unnecessary deaths that occur. It just...happens. And the shock resonates more in you than the person it effects. Redemption in brutality is a long road which starts with forgiveness for crimes you were never tried for.",Hostiles

Respect for others not like youThings I liked:
Rosemund Pike is always a pleasure to watch.
Christian Bale gives a solid performance with impressive depth and seems right at home in 1892 frontier America. This is his second Western. His first was 3:10 To Yuma. 
I thought it was interesting to learn that the film was shot in chronological order. That rarely happens. Most of the film was shot outdoors in New Mexico and Arizona, exposing the actors to the hostile elements. Q'orianka Kilcher suffered heat stroke during filming.
I first noticed Stephen Lang in Avatar. He's the quintessential military man.
Beautiful landscapes that make you realize that parts of America haven't changed one bit in hundreds of years.
Wes Studi plays a respectful Chief Yellow Hawk.
Director/writer Scott Cooper has gotten a lot of attention for his solid work with this film.
Satisfying character arcs for several characters.
Things I didn't like:
Sometimes it's hard to understand what people are saying. With all those beards, you can't even read their lips.
Sometimes it's hard to see what's going on in the night time scenes when it's dark.
The Native Americans are fairly one-dimensional characters.
It's slow moving.
The content is dark and grim.
I sure am glad I didn't have to live back then. 
Interesting lines:
""If I did not have faith, what would I have?"" - Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike).
""Sometimes I envy the finality of death, the certainty, and I have to drive those thoughts away when I'm weak."" - RosalieIf you like this movie, you'll probably enjoy

I mean I swear down they had hold of a long scene and have gone ""how do we make this even longer?"" So many conversations just don't have relevance. I'd say it really starts about an hour in.

79,akcenat,Above average slow burn wild wild west PTSD drama which I did like,8,13 August 2018,"Westerns have been quite the resilient genre, but the same time Hostiles is not usual gunslinger/outlaw Western. It is about change, which includes grief and what adapting means to one's moral compass. Christian Bale - who masterfully captures the PTSD-like weariness of a soldier who's killed too many - stars as an Army captain who is given orders to take an imprisoned sickly Cheyenne chief home to his reservation to die as a free man. But, like the other films directed by Cooper, each of those films seem to be in no rush to get where they are going. Bookended by an intense intro and tense finale which are thrillingly brutal, Hostiles also takes the long way in reaching its destination. Actually film feels even longer than it is (133m) because it prioritizes mood over narrative depth and momentum. The story itself follows a fairly predictable path, but at the same time film boasts a cast of brilliant actors which performances are quite good and the location photography is breathtakingly at times.In short, Hostiles is a mixed-bag drama when it comes to story and execution and like so many westerns, still mostly adheres to the one-sided stereotypical story telling. Film fails to reach its full potential, wanders off course from time to time, but eventually manages to deliver its simple message and understanding right on time. The movie generally worked for me, and it's been a good few years now since I came away from a cinema with that feeling about a western.8/10",Hostiles

81,stevenrotherforth,A fine addition to the genre fuelled by some fine performances,8,11 October 2018,"HostilesScott Cooper's western drama about a legendary Army Captain who reluctantly agrees to escort a Cheyenne chief and his family through dangerous territory is a movie that is memorable due to some fine performances by the films cast.
Christian Bale plays grizzled Captain Joseph J Blocker fuelled by hatred for his Native American enemy.
Through the course of this captivating story Blockers outlook and feelings change towards those he is forced to escort.
They are forced to pull together as threat closes in on them throughout their journey.
Blockers change of heart is also partially due to the chance meeting with a distraught mother who's family fall foul to a group of natives trying to steal her families horses.
The opening scene where Rosalee Quaid's husband and three children are brutally butchered sets this movies tone.
Indeed there are hostiles in all shapes and sizes from all directions. 1892 Montana was certainly a dangerous time to be alive.
It is Rosamund Pike who plays grieving mother Rosalee that gives the standout performance here.
The opening scene as she fights for her life showcases some fine acting indeed.Cooper balances good doses of drama with well timed action set pieces resulting in a piece of cinema that is never dull.
Chemistry between Bale and Pike is another plus point that demands the audience to care for this movies characters.
There's good support too from the likes of Rory Cochrane who plays broken Master Sergeant Thomas Metz. A man who's done with the killing. 
It is perhaps Cooper's attention to his characters that make this film such an engaging watch.
The movie looks splendid too, as you would expect from a western drama.
Sweeping landscapes are abundant and the camera always gives the audience something for the eye to feast upon.
If you are a fan of this genre then Hostiles is certainly the treat you've been looking for.

82,twelve-house-books,Better Than Dances With Wolves,10,1 August 2018,"Dances With Wolves, Woman Walks Ahead, Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, and this film should all be viewed in order to get a fairly well-rounded picture of what actually happened in the late 19th Century with the removal of the Indians from their homelands. This one stands out as the best of all four because of the brutal honesty and the in-depth study of the main characters. With Dances With Wolves, many of us are tempted to utterly hate the U.S. Army and see them as evil paper-doll cutouts worthy only of burning, but the soldiers in this film are real people. They explain why they had to be brutal. Now we all know that war is wrong for any reason, and that there is always a better way to go about doing business with people perceived to be the enemy. However, once in the middle of it, what does one do when he witnesses firsthand a violent tribe of aboriginals doing everything they can to protect their homeland, which includes killing him and his fellow soldiers? He has no choice at that point other than to become just as violent. Well, maybe he does have a choice. Dances With Wolves (the Costner character) becomes an Indian. That is a possibility, but during this era one would have had to go deep into Canada to maintain the lifestyle. In any case, the soldiers in this film were burdened by what they had been told to do by the U.S. Gov't.

85,ginocox-206-336968,A gritty Western that suffers from muddled dramatic perspective,7,13 April 2018,"Hostiles (2017) has some very strong elements, including outstanding performances by Christian Bale and Stephen Lang, strong supporting performances, excellent production values in the cinematography and costumes, and the pristine beauty of the American West. One element it lacks is a clear, consistent dramatic perspective. Much of the film is POV Captain Blocker (Bale), but it's not consistent. The opening scenes alternate between POV Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike) and POV Wesley Quaid, but then it cuts to what seems to be POV Comanche warriors, but then the Comanche horses ride into the frame from behind the camera, so the shot may actually have been POV omniscient observer. This may seem a nitpick; however, without a clear dramatic perspective, it's difficult to convey a moral or theme, which is a failure here. The filmmakers seem to want to make a political statement or social observation regarding treatment of the American Indians. At one point a character declares the treatment is disgraceful, but is quickly silenced, as if it is a dirty secret. At various points, various characters describe the Cheyenne and Comanche as brutal and bloodthirsty, but also allow that Blocker and others have been equally savage. But most of this discourse is in exposition and we don't see much of the Indian's side of the story, except in the behavior of Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) who is dying of cancer and not his usual bloodthirsty self. A second problem with the POV and occasional switches to omniscient observer, is that much of the action occurs off-camera. Three of the most dramatic scenes occur off-camera, although we hear one and see the consequences of another. The film reminds me of Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004). Like Creasy (Denzel Washington), Blocker has committed acts of unspeakable savagery, but only because he had a job to do and an obligation to follow orders. He wants to leave it all behind and retire to a life of peace and quietude, but violence intrudes and ultimately, he must commit more acts of savagery because now that is what he is, a man as savage as his former adversaries.",Hostiles

88,kaptenvideo-89875,"A tough but spiritual western, which seems has slipped from the radar of the awards season",8,17 February 2018,"""Hostiles"" is one of the great overlooked movies of this award season, a Western that gives us another great performance by one of the best screen actors of our time, the prince of intense, Christian Bale.During 2010's, he's been nominated for Oscar three times already, so he's been unceremoniously cast aside this time, although ""Hostiles"" brings one of his finest achievements of this decade.An Army Capten (Bale) and his team escort a dying Indian chief (Wes Studi) and his family back to his tribal lands. As one would expect, a lot of shooting and majestic vistas of great American wild stand on the way, before we reach the destination.There's also a very fine and big big supporting cast. I would like to give credit to many of them but in fear of losing your attention, I'll just mention the more famous ones, including Rosamund Pike, Peter Mullan, Ben Foster, Jesse Plemons, and Timothée Chalamet (the young rising star of ""Call Me By Your Name"").So, what's so special about another Western, haven't we seen enough of them, you might ask. Well, as much as I appreciate its qualities as violent and hard-hitting drama about tough people doing some tough shit, I view ""Hostiles"" as a spiritual movie first, reminding of two basic truths about life: growth is possible in all kinds of conditions, and the way may open up only if one has truly had enough of suffering.The movie is a powerful and meditative study of violence and the possibility of redemption, showing both bad and good that being in war may bring.The main character, the legendary Army Captain, is equally multifaceted. First, he seems just a tough as nails hero type but there are other aspects of him to shed light upon. He turns out to be surprisingly flexible mentally at times, choosing improving his survival chances over pride.Also, just as the society of the U.S. of that time, he's begun to question his choices and mindset concerning natives, and started seeing the different sides of the life of war that he has chosen.Here's where the acting madskillz of Bale come into play and have a chance to shine. He's totally captivating as Western hero type, an old school gunslinger that is all instinct and sharp aim first and being civil later - watching him begs the question whether the character is all human or part animal.But there's also lifetime of war written in Bale's face, all the violence and death seen and done and left behind - and yet still somehow smouldering behind the surface - which is all the more impressive considering that he's most probably haven't seen most of it personally and had to dig the relevant emotions up from collective subconscious or something.For me, witnessing his face alone made the quite long movie worth watching! It's a performance with depth, range, and presence that most actors would envy, and it deserves a place among the greatest war movie performances of all the time.Think Sam Elliott who's spent his life killing people (instead of acting), and you may get the idea.In short, ""Hostiles"" is great but not suitable for everybody. It's certainly too slow and depressing for some, and the last chapter is too long.Personally, I'd have left out the last battle which doesn't really leave that strong of an effect after all the bloodshed we've already seen. It's like hammering home a point that the audience has already had time and chance to digest.But still, it's another worthy addition to 2017's strong selection of best movies - not to mention its gorgeous-looking-ness briefly mentioned above. I am deeply disappointed to see ""Hostiles"" overlooked by award juries everywhere.I hope that it will share the fate of 2002's Bale-starrer ""Equilibrium"" at least, a sci-fi that didn't impress critics upon its release but turned into cult classic soon.By the way, ""Hostiles's"" director and co-writer Scott Cooper also did 2013's ""Out of the Furnace"" which is another of the Bale's best movies of this decade.",Hostiles
89,dommercaldi,"An Intrinsically Violent, Sombre, And Overall Mediocre Western",6,17 December 2020,"Pros:
1. The cinematography is stunning as it incorporates beautiful shots of the natural scenery, as well as the stillness of the shots belying the endemic violence which hardens the impact of said violence.
2. The costume and set design is great and it creates the setting perfectly.
3. The score does a wonderful job at enforcing a heavy and emotional atmosphere.
4. Christian Bale (Capt. Joseph J. Blocker), Wes Studi (Chief Yellow Hawk), and Rosamund Pike (Rosalee Quaid) give fantastic performances.
5. The violence is compelling, intense, and brutal.
6. The film shows the complicated and nuanced history of violence and conflict between European Americans and Native Americans instead of berating one side. This is encapsulated by the scene where Capt. Joseph J. Blocker and Chief Yellow Hawk acknowledge each other in addition to forgiving each others' transgressions.Cons:
1. Very few characters are fleshed out enough for you to form any attachment to them.
2. Rosalee Quaid, although having her entire family slaughtered by Comanche's, almost immediately forgets about that and befriends other Native Americans (albeit they were Cheyenne) just because they offered her a dress. It just seems forced and unrealistic.
3. A couple of the American accents, specifically from Rory Cochrane (Master Sgt. Thomas Metz) and Paul Anderson (Corp. Tommy Thomas), are a little inconsistent and wayward.
4. The last shoot-out scene feels wholly unnecessary and comes across as a cheap way to kill off a load of characters.

91,doorsscorpywag,The Searchers? Not even fit to clean Big John's boot.,3,5 February 2018,"The idea that this was in the same league as The Searchers or Outlaw Josie Wales if laughable. True the director uses some stunning landscapes rather well but there was more to it than that and John Ford got it. This bloke did not.I am a fan of Christian Bale and think him a great actor along with Wes Studi and the criminally underused Steven Lang.
But nobody could save this boring tripe.A day shot consisted of a line of horses and a night shot some dull conversation in a camp.The boredom is broken up by some violence to give us the reason for the title. The opening scene showed the director was no John Ford. A rather comical albeit tragic attack on a cabin. The man rushes out to confront the half dozen hostiles and is cut down. 
Why he did not stay in the cabin and pick them off as they came to him is just one conundrum of this dull as dishwater movie.
His wife and her 3 kids stand watching instead of running away to allow her to have a reason to be in the last part of the film.Bale plays a Nathan Brittles type of part but instead of being sympathetic as John was he hates the Indjun! 
He is sent off to take one of the objects of that hate to his home so he can die.
It is pretty obvious what was going to happen as Studi and Bale begin to see the light that hatred gets you nowhereThe journey is a tedious one and by the time we go to Montana I was all bored out. Like his Black Mass we get a lot of mumbling which makes it hard to follow sometimes which is annoying but mainly it is just plain boring. The ending scene was ridiculous and a sop to all those that love a 'happy' ending to their movies about the 'Wild' West.Sadly it did not end that well for the Native Indians. Something John Ford was able to capture masterfully in his Westerns such as The Searchers or She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.
Clint Eastwood was the nearest we have come to since Ford and he too was a master of the Western genre.

92,harrylosborne,A quality cast can't cover this cop-out Western,6,17 March 2020,"When this first released in cinemas, I knew it would either fall in the category of A) amazing film with lots of nuance, or B) utterly forgettable drama which happens to have nice mountains in it. However, you show me Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike in a Western (not forgetting Jesse Plemons and Timothee Chalamet), I will watch it. In hindsight, I should have trusted the critic's reviews over the public, because ""Hostiles"" ruins a promising beginning with a formulaic story of acceptance.Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is an Army Captain on the verge of retirement, forced to escort a captive Cheyenne chieftain and his family through backcountry USA to his homeland. Blocker is a true believer that Native Americans are a plague on the land, and my god Bale is good at being an intimidating figure when he wants to be. However, you can see early on that Bale's escort party is so rigid in its makeup: one avid racist alongside him, a naive younger soldier, his trusted footman and a self-doubting second-in-command. You can see from a mile off that Blocker's character is going to begin to accept the Cheyenne as the story trundles along, and this is such a disappointing plot device.The film opens so well - Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike) sees her family gunned down by a ruthless Native American hunting party, and she scrambles through the forest clutching the body of her dead child. For some reason, they put music over this scene (even though the sounds of gunfire and screaming should have been the soundtrack) - this early discrepancy alerted me that some strange decisions may be made in how this film was produced. This was confirmed when, having watched the entire of this 134-minute film, I realised Pike's character was wholly inconsequential to the plot. Any time a film has to use a big name to fill a void, there must be something wrong with the source material.Director Scott Cooper is someone known for producing big-potential but fairly underwhelming films: ""Black Mass"" with Johnny Depp was an anonymous piece of cinema, and his previous project with Bale (""Out Of The Furnace"") actually made a loss at the box office. ""Hostiles"" is just a bit predictable, a bit boring, and a bit of a misfire in a genre that so often does well for itself. At least you can say the cast was strong - even if not a lot else was worth watching for.",Hostiles
93,dakjets,Much more than just a western movie,9,9 August 2018,"This is a very successful western movie. In addition to having all the elements that should be in place in such genre film, the film also deals with personal choices and personal development. Can enemies develop friendship? Can hatred become love? This movie has many layers, which makes you drag into the action. The gallery is deep and complex. This is primarily Christian Bales film. His portrayal and interpretation of the captain who must do tasks far beyond the concubine are both touching and moving. I've seen many movies with him and I think this is one of his strongest achievements ever. The rest of the actors are strong too, and together they form a winning and credible collection of characters that lifts this movie for something extra. It deserves a big crowd and you do not have to be a big fan of the western genre, to like this movie.",Hostiles
94,Lewis_Heather787,The forgotten gem of 2017,8,6 June 2018,"How did this film not have more of an impact when it landed in cinemas? Why was this film not mentioned in any award shows? These are the burning questions that I have after viewing this film because it was extremely surprising and very good. Scott Cooper has directed an absolute beautiful looking film which contrasts so brilliantly with the dark and sombre story that is unfolding in front of us. Cooper has obviously got a great relationship with his cinematographer because this film is gorgeous and stunning to look at. The film itself is directed brilliant and has some really interesting camera shots that aren't normally in a film like this, its what sets it apart from being just an ordinary western. Fantastic job.The story is quite simple in the beginning, but gets more and more interesting and complex as the film progresses. Overall a fascinating story of two opposite worlds being forced together in a situation and coming to terms with each other. I believe that the hidden meaning behind the film is inclusion of one another rather than division, which is very topical in modern America today. The cast is outstanding all across the board however there are two standouts that are just above the rest. Firstly and probably obviously Christian Bale is the best part of the film plain and simple. His character in the beginning is a biggot and a racist but as the story unfolds you see the conflict within the character as the film goes on, wondering if what he believes in is right, portrayed brilliantly by Bale. There are some scenes throughout the film that Bale is just out of this world good, one that distinctively standouts is a scene where he is saying goodbye at an injured solider laying in bed. The emotion in that scene is extremely raw and powerful, Bale is incredible, some of his best work in years. How did he not get nominated for any awards? The other standout of the film is Rosamund Pike who was a real surprise in the film because her character was definitely not what I was expecting. She has a great character arc throughout the film from the horrifying beginning to the satisfying end where it looks as if her life will turn around. Has some great scenes with Bale that serve the characters and the story really well.There are only two very small negatives I have with the film, firstly the film can be a little sluggish here and there. For 2 hour 10 minute running time it feels at lot longer than that, pacing is a little off. The other negative I have is Ben Foster's character, I just didn't get enough of his character. He turned up and then he was dead, would have loved to see more as him and Bale's characters obviously had history. Overall this is a real modern western that is dark but full of emotion with a great central character and story. 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10 this is a really good film I just cant believe that it was forgotten it is such a shame because it deserves your attention. If you love westerns, you will love however its probably not for everyone because it is very dark and quite slow. In my opinion a real hidden gem.",Hostiles
95,drunken_munki,Deviates from historical accuracy,4,18 November 2020,"Shot well enough, but too dark in many scenes.The gruff performances of any characters is borderline incomprehensible, which is unusual for a western themed story.I had to give up before too long, and walk out.4/10 I really didn't enjoy this one.",Hostiles

97,peeedeee-94281,A good half of a movie,5,16 December 2018,"The movie starts off promising. First you deal with the shock of Rosamund Pike's family being murdered, then you are introduced to a separate story line of Christian Bale's Cavalry Officer character who has killed many a man. He is tasked to escort a Native American Cheyenne Chief played by Wes Studi, who has killed many of Bale's men.
Tensions are high as they hit the road, then their story and and Rosamund Pike's story merge. But that's where the movie seems to go off the rails. The 'revenge' for Pike's family happens almost soon after, so that's the end of that drama. Perhaps the director could have pushed that further into the film. And the way it was done was very anti climactic.
After there, there's more random occurrences of attacks from natives and other white men. One after another. Also, there's an added on section where they have to escort a prisoner for some reason, and that adds to more drama. But none of it really has meaning or adds to the story.
By the end of the movie, there's an unnecessary confrontation that kills off the rest of the characters except for three.
So this movie is essentially a series of random, violent attacks, and plays out like an Agatha Christie novel in that you keep wondering who is going to bite the bullet next. Very repetitive and without any meaning. Even the arrival at the Chief's home territory was anti-climactic, and so tagging on that final shootout seemed exploitive rather than an advancement of the plot.
If the director had fashioned this movie to parallel some greek odyssey story, then it might have more meaning. But overall, you just feel like 'meh' at the end.",Hostiles

I'm always looking forward to a great western so I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately there is very little special or memorable about this film.For its strengths the movie is well acted and shot. Christian Bale as always did a phenomenal job. His looks and stoic mannerisms we're perfect for the role. His co-star Rosamund Pike also did a excellent job. I really can't complain about the entire ensemble cast.The movie was exceptionally well shot. There were some genuinely beautiful and breathtaking shots of the wilderness that made this feel like an epic Western. All around the movie made excellent use of its setting to advance the plot.I also enjoyed that the movie did not glamorize the Wild West. The movie depicted the stark brutality of the era and how difficult it was just to survive. It even included early depictions of PTSD among the soldiers for the atrocities committed against the Native Americans.Unfortunately the plot was not the most original. The film was also incredibly predictable, and at times overly-long. None of these factors made it a an unenjoyable movie, but they certainly didn't help it either.Overall Hostiles has its strong points in its acting, cinematography, and depiction of the era. These points definitely make a good movie, just not the most original or memorable one. A 7.5 out of 10.",Hostiles

103,foxtografo,Absolutely boring,4,20 May 2019,"Once you've seen enough of the beautiful landscapes, you start realising how boring is the movie. Shoot of them riding the horses, to shoot of them camping, to shoot riding, to shoot camping...
Good actors are stuck with poorly written characters, I never got to connect with anyone, or respect anyone for what they were because it was not clear really...
Even if it was unnecessarily long, the movie didn't get right the pace of how characters change, I fount it quite unbelievable.
Plus, the silly shootings, where all these ""great soldiers"" fail to shoot anyone even if they're standing close, after failing at every moment of the movie to have a good strategy to fight or protect their party. Lame.
Really, it was a pain to watch, and I only made to the end out of curiosity to witness an even more lame ending, unnecessarily stupid and melodramatic.
Terrible. I'd really give it less score, but the setting and landscapes were really beautiful, so at this level I guess I enjoyed it. I wish it was one hour shorter so I could have one more hour sleep now.
Bad story, bad script, bad characters... what a disappointment!!",Hostiles
104,hunter-friesen,"It's a sad, sad, sad, sad western world",6,21 February 2018,"Christian Bale is one of the best actors working today. He has the ability to do so much with so little, raising the bar each time he takes on a new character. But, Bale is only a mortal man. He alone cannot carry a film alone, which is exactly the task that is set upon him in Hostiles. Bale does an excellent job, but he doesn't get much support and his performance becomes almost wasted in a film that is middle of the road at best. The story takes place in 1892, a time when Native and American tensions were at their highest. Revered army captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is close to retiring with a kill count well over one hundred. For his last mission, to his dismay, he must escort a dying native chief (Wes Studi) and his family so he may be buried in his homeland. Blocker and his section must saddle up to make the treacherous journey, which treks from New Mexico to Montana. They quickly meet up with Rosalie (Rosamund Pike), a country woman who recently lost her family to a native raid, leaving her in an elongated state of mental shock. Along with battling elements and the discontent within themselves, the troops must also fend off against warring tribes that are out for blood. The film is a conventional western through and through, boasting gorgeous shots of the landscape and plenty of shootouts. It tries to call back to the times of John Wayne. While this film tries to harken back to the golden era of westerns, it fails to incorporate one vital component; simplicity. Old westerns were straightforward and to the point, this one isn't. The film is slow and meandering, often taking breaks from the main plot in an effort to build up the epic scale. So much has happened by the end that it becomes impossible to connect at all to the characters or story. Also to the detriment of connectivity is the high body count. Tons of characters are either introduced or half developed, and then killed off to try and force you into caring about them. What director Scott Cooper doesn't understand is that if you don't care about a character when they are living, then you are not going to care about them when they're dead.Now with a couple successful films under his belt, Cooper tries here to illustrate the brutality of western life. He emphasizes the blood, sweat, and tears of each character and how they deal with their seemingly miserable lives. Unfortunately, Cooper overplays his hand as constantly watching 134 minutes of emotional suffering begins to bore quickly. Characters incomprehensibly mutter nonstop about how sad they are and how they wish they could just end it all.The cinematography is beautifully done by Masanobu Takayanagi, marking his third collaboration with Cooper. Takayanagi keeps the camera motionless most of the time and allows for the characters to move within the frame. This technique gives the western world a sense of stillness, almost like the people are the only thing inhabiting the cruel setting. But people are not the only physical inhabitants. Takayanagi has an eye for surrounding scenery that makes the characters almost feel insignificant compared to the vastness of the land and wildlife.The film touts some great actors in both leading and supporting roles. Some meet and exceed past the lofty demands, while others struggle to make a difference. Christian Bale is definitely the best part of the film as he carries most of the emotional weight. He has so much in his acting arsenal and is able to switch from gruff killer to stoic hero in the blink of an eye. Rosamund Pike does well with her conflicted character, who is forced into a new, harder life after the butchering of her family. Finally, Wes Studi and Jesse Plemons do respectable jobs with the limited time they get. For the most part, the actors that struggle to make an impact are the ones whose characters are underdeveloped. Ben Foster cameos as a soldier accused of murder, which is part of a side plot that serves no real purpose. Foster doesn't do anything new as he plays the character that gives the same old ""we're not so different"" speech a couple of times. Timothée Chalamet surprisingly turns up here, trying to add to his already fabulous 2017. His silly french accent and his four total lines of dialogue make him laughably bad. Fortunately for Chalamet, most people won't bring this film up when talking to him.While it is ambitious, Hostiles can be slow and rambling as it hopelessly tries to keep your full engagement. No fingers or blame can be pointed, only wishes that there could have been something more. It's not good, it's not bad, it's just alright.",Hostiles

106,LaxFan94,No need for hostility in this film.,8,14 November 2021,"I loved this film since it has an all-star cast. Like many other modern-day westerns, this one shows co-operation between Natives and whites. Of course, in real life, there would have never been a president to assign an officer to guide a Native family from one part of the country to another. That was unheard of. But in films, everything is all about the white man ""helping"" the Natives. It's NEVER about Natives helping themselves without whites always being there by their sides. This film's poster shows Christian Bale standing front and center with Wes Studi standing behind him.But right from the film's start, when the Comanches attacked the white family, that was one of the worst scenes because it only perpetuated the notorious stereotypes of ""savages"" attacking innocent white settlers! One thing needs to be clear: Natives attacked no one for no reason unless someone had done them wrong first. That went for the settlers too. Don't take what you see at face value because it's never true what is seen and what really goes on behind the scenes.I think it would have been a better start if army soldiers rode to that home to order the family to evacuate the premises soon because they had planned on constructing a fort there. But the family steadfastly refuses to do so. Then Natives would come into the picture not by attacking the family but to help the family move out if the soldiers returned to move them out by force.That one scene where that black soldier was in that hospital bed: I cried lots because it so sad to see him crying.The last scene where that group of landowners rode over to the Captain to tell him and everyone else to get off his land: I liked how the young lady pointed her rifle at the father. She led well there, as it showed that women empowered themselves when it was needed.Racism against Natives was evident throughout this film, as was unnecessary cussing. Christian Bale's character and most of the other white characters are guilty of that. He hated having to guide the Native family to Montana, but he had his orders. In the end, he ate his words and eventually befriended them.Anyway, this one earns an eight out of ten.",Hostiles

Or the ones in uniforms, with guns, the ones who put them there? The theme of violence is front and centre in 'Hostiles', a contemplative western that explores what killing does to a man, and the everlasting effects it has on the mind and soul.Christian Bale puts in a powerful, layered performance as army captain Joseph Blocker, who reluctantly agrees to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief and his family back to their tribal land. But the journey is fraught with peril as he discovers the landscape is crawling with vicious Comanche's. So he must set aside his hatred and band together with the chief in order to survive...Writer-director Scott Cooper adds another great film to his filmography here. 'Hostiles' has a stately pace that occasionally feels laborious in the middle, but it also commands attention. Characters are exposed as the flawed people they are, harbouring regrets for pasts which prove difficult to escape from. Redemptive paths are blurry, challenging to navigate, but most importantly there; something for each one to aim for, especially Bale's conflicted protagonist.The film is also visually stunning. The widescreen format allows the pleasant open grasslands and glorious mountain ranges to stretch across the screen, while the cinematography is impressive throughout when capturing group conversations or brutal shootouts.Overall, 'Hostiles' is a western well worth investing time in. It takes its time to develop its characters which makes the end results all the more satisfying, and Scott Cooper's direction and Christian Bale's performance are of the highest quality.8/10",Hostiles

112,zenmateisshite,"Quite an average movie, lacks originality",7,27 September 2020,"It is trying to imitate other great movies (which is not that bad an Idea) but falls flat.The revenant was amazing in showing the dichotomy between the stunning beauty and brutal harshness of the American frontier during that period of history. Hostiles did not.Dances with Wolves was able to show the complexity of human life and culture, and the nuance in the struggles of both the native and the invading American peoples. Hostiles did manage that to a certain extent but it felt forced and the development of characters was not consistent with the story. Also, we seem to have had woke soldiers in 1892.3:10 to Yuma was able to show the extent of outlaw-ness in the American West. Hostiles did that but the story was not as compelling, real, or interesting to watch. Oddly enough Batman, I mean Bale, and Foster were excellent in both movies. In fact all the actors were great in Hostiles. The characters, not so much.The Last Samurai was able to shed some light on the horrors of war, and in particular, its affect on men in a subtle and even spiritual way. Hostiles did not. It was emotional in some places but I do not believe this was truly reflected as in, was not historically accurate. A man talking about his emotions to another man in 1892? Are you mad? Soldiers from the ""greatest generation"" to the mot recent war are still barely able to verbalize their suffering; and you're telling me they did that in 1892?!",Hostiles

It is also a little gory BUT the gore is rooted in historical accuracy. It wasn't gore just for the sake of gore. It was gore for the sake of portraying true history versus glorifying it or glossing over it.I support Hollywood's attempts to portray natives of this land in a respectful and authentic manner, but I try not to allow that to influence my rating of the film itself. Additionally, I have never been a big fan of the female lead in this film as she always seems wooden and expressionless to me. She did better in this film than others but her facial expression still looks a bit frozen to me. This may sound like a joke but could it be Botox?The pace of this film is painfully and unnecessarily slow. I understand the concept of the painfully slow pace is to allow the scene you just witnessed or are witnessing to penetrate. It gets to the point where I grew impatient for the scene to finally end so I started fast-forwarding through some parts. This cadence replays itself through most of the film.Some reviewers attempt to compare Hostiles to Dances With Wolves for some strange reason. Other than having a Union Soldier and Native Americans share the same screen, these movies have absolutely nothing in common save the following: Dances With Wolves is 3 hours long. Hostiles feels 3 hours long, but it is actually 2 hours and 14 minutes.Hostiles is a fairly solid film mainly due to the actors. However it missed the mark. I think it is worth watching when you want to fill a gap in your schedule. Just be prepared to wait for some scenes to go by in what feels like slow motion. They also went over board with the guilt a particular soldier displays over the things he has done. Moreover, his apology scene seemed pretentious and inauthentic (not the acting, the scene). It was actually Hollywood trying to inject a 2017 apology to Native Americans to make some people feel better about themselves and their pretentious sense of guilt. Yet these same people with their pretentious sense of guilt don't lift a finger to actually help the people they pretend to feel so guilty about (Oops.

He went down the same path as Gary Oldman. The whole time I'm watching him 'act' I'm thinking ""I could do so much better"". He exudes zero charisma or appeal. He can't carry a film at all.Scenes are dragged out beyond belief. Characters do stupid things and don't act like real people. If your prisoner is attacking you, you would surely shout out for help seeming as your colleagues are in tents 10 yards away. The director tried too hard to make the viewer care for certain characters and just failed. Long drawn out scene with IRRITATING lifeless facial expressions.This film had absolutely nothing to say.

Timothée Chalamet was even a worst casting decision than Rosamund Pike, he can't act to save his life and he's so misplaced as Private Philippe DeJardin that looks like he was going to a kind of a masquerade party.Even the action scenes and the use of violence, when the movie kind of awakes from its lethargie, are so phony staged (and badly edited) that reminds a lot of Quentin Tarantino's or Robert Rodriguez over-the-top cartoonish sequences.The general critics are cheating the audiences (like they did with the terrible ""Black Panther"" this year), saying this is the best revisionist western since ""Unforgiven"" ('92) and it's au pair with ""Dances with Wolves"" ('90) , but just ignore them, it's a case of ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes"".
As a genre piece, ""Open Range"" ('03) directed by Kevin Costner, it's 10 times better than what ""Hostiles"" ever dreamed to be.In short, if you want to pass through this film please drink a double coffee or an energetic drink, its only appealing factors are the beautiful landscapes' cinematography and fans of Christian Bale will like his performance, besides that, it's a rather painful movie experience which gets on the viewer's nerves.As a footnote, after i've finished this film i was thinking that with several re-writes and a competent genre director (such as Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner) how this movie could have been...",Hostiles
119,kenstallings-65346,A riveting story,8,3 July 2018,"Many reviewing Hostiles have chosen to seize upon avenues to criticize the film.

The time period of the story would have ideally taken place from 1879 to 1880, when Rutherford Hayes was President, and the United States had largely defeated hostile tribes in the southwest and northern plains, but would be before the establishment of the railroad lines in New Mexico. This would have necessitated the pack mule excursion to Montana. It also would have allowed sufficient time to pass, given the references to Wounded Knee (1873) and Little Big Horn (1876), for the bitter memories to start to recede and allow the reflections shown in the movie to take place.However, a fair review of this movie must avoid getting bogged down in historical minutia and instead focus on the story, because it is very poignant.In many ways, this movie is to be congratulated for avoiding the modern day political traps that permeate so much of entertainment today. The opening scene is brutal and forms the core of the story. A band of renegades attack a settlement home and leave a gash of misery in their wake. But, that is the coda of what the protagonists deal with, past chapters of great violence in a collision of hostile cultures. The isolated acts of violence that happen later are as much a cleaning up of past deeds and a completion of the catharsis of reconciliation.This movie is an immersion into the psyche of those who carry out acts of wartime violence, in a fight for survival, and how they try to retain their sanity and civility. As the story shows, some handle it better than others. None escape without deep scars.There is a second theme that runs throughout the movie, ignorant people at the beginning and the end, attempting to lodge their persuasion onto the protagonists. None of these men suffered the wartime violence, but instead try to insert an empty moralizing, or attempt to enact their selfish will despite the clear Presidential mandate to allow the mission to proceed. The reporter at the start of the film is silenced through humiliation. The second group at the end of the film meets a more lasting end. And at the end, we are left with shared misery among the few survivors, who try to bravely go on with what is left good to cling to.Christian Bale is masterful in this movie. It is sad that his performance was not properly recognized. Ultimately, this is a story of redemption, and in that regard it mirrors what took place over generations in America. A clash of survival ending with one side defeated, while both sides had to reconcile the shared experience of brutality. It avoids political finger-pointing, and in that regard strikes the proper degree of respect for both sides in this American struggle. It is a welcome addition to Hollywood's collection of period movies.",Hostiles
120,themovieparadise,"Fascinating Character Study, But Struggles With Pace",7,2 February 2018,"Hostiles centers around Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale), a hardened American soldier who absolutely despises Native Americans. He says that he has seen enough savagery from them to surmise that all Native Americans are lawless mass-killers. However, when his superior (Stephan Lang) orders him to oversee the safe travel of the dying Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) to his rightful land, Joe must come to grips with his own prejudice. With his fourth directorial effort, Scott Cooper crafts a fascinating look at when the falsehoods a man believes crumbles right before his eyes. How does one adapt when something they've believed their entire lives is entirely dismantled? While the second act does have some dry patches, Hostiles is an interesting character study, backed by a great performance from Christian Bale, even if the film does struggle with its pace...",Hostiles
121,JamesRutland,"good story, bad script/storytelling, sufficient recitation",2,20 October 2020,"The recitation of the protagonists doesn't convince me as well as the characters which are too much stereotyped, the storytelling is too much phase-forced, so to get the final result. Many choices the characters make don't match with the situation, indeed, how can a captain let a woman faces the risks in a trip after she has already faced several dangers during the previous trip and her own family deaths? The woman and the captain lies in the same tent when many others are free, acting how there is no other possibility to avoid the captain otherwise stays under the rain. It's not plausible. The director put together the two characters in a unreal way. The movie misses the reasonableness in the choices mismatching the context where they are made, if not to adapt the story to the final result. The movie follows the banal logic so defined by a chain of act-aftermath, where a situation happens and someone dies, another circumstance happens so another one or more of the fellowship dies and so on, until the happy family ending where the two culture learn to stay together because of the previous sad events. The storytelling tries to provide a solution to the cruelty of the fight between two cultures involved in feral acts unable to communicate because of their differences. But the try by which the white culture excuses its brutal approach doesn't convince me as viewer. The positive is the general story idea behind the movie and the recitation in some of the non protagonist actors.",Hostiles

A self-awareness is good for anyone esp. those who dealt in combat as a constant threat as these characters did but what didn't ring very true was the time period 1892 - New Mexico Territory. There were railroads that went straight up to Fort Collins-CO and the reference to Fort Pearce was across the Green River in Utah Territory close to St. George - no where near to a trek to MT esp. having to cross the Green River.The violence was warranted but it was constant but the most foolish stunt was the final violent scene with the father and his 3 sons - all four racists at least per the father's remarks.

Some breaks are too big for moviebuffs to forgive imo, so if you are one and you're looking for solidity you're better off finding another movie.It has most ingredients you'd want from this kind of movie, including an excellent cast who does well, except in the dialogue which breaks with lines from known movies on a handful of times. Lines that shouldn't have been kept in. It's not just actors wanting them, the scenes are set up for them in a way that i believe the director or a producer insisted on it that way.
Character rationale also breaks right in the beginning of the movie. When a settler/farmer leaves the safety of his house as 4 or 5 indians come straight for him on an open field - did i mention this farm had clear openable windows in all directions? He tells his wife to run away, which she waits with until its too late, whereupon she magically gets a huge advantage on a horse as she flees behind a hill. She also gets to demonstrate her screamqueen abilities, which is kinda pulled out of context the first time around, so is the time her scenes are given which derails the emotionality of them a fair bit and makes it feel choppy.
When it comes to the cast you can see how some hold back, for whatever reason - too many takes? Put on that that Ben Foster isn't utilised enough. Wes Studi leaves a good mark on the movie, you can see he still has these kinds of movies in him wo breaking a sweat.Missing character rationality or missing time given to create logic patterns in actions is what is the problem here coupled with bad editing and shotty dialogue (at times). And yes i allmost forgot the modern day southern values being snuck in and being at the front of the good soldiers hearts (feel like a try to rewrite history) more than a time to jump on the train to tomorrow.

137,eparazak,A character driven story that is mostly effective.,7,5 February 2018,"Hostiles is about the journey of an American military captain and some of his crew, a woman who lost her entire family and some captive Native Americans. These people are on an escort mission to the Native American homes in Montana to safely bring back said band of Native Americans. Throughout their journey, they would have to brave through tough conditions as well as ""savage"" Indians that are on their tail.This was a movie I would either like or really hate due to its themes, and rather than looking at the Native Americans in a bad light, the characters slowly open up to them. This is mostly a character driven western rather than an action filled one. Christian Bale plays an army captain who is notorious for killing several Indians as a soldier and is reluctant about the ones he's escorting. Rosamund Pike is the lone survivor of a family of five in an attack from an Indian army and has grown fearful of them as a result. The movie's main leads are both understandable and realistic characters who are being tested by the sight of them and that's the movie's biggest strong point.This movie is mostly slow paced, which works mostly to help the audience sink in the dialogue. Christian Bale is really good in here. His character takes risks while his state of mind gets put to the test. Rosamund Pike may be even better as a broken soul. The opening scene where her home and loved ones get taken away from her is heartbreaking and helps to set up her character.Despite the strong themes about prejudice and well-realized characters, the way the movie tells its story feels uneven and repetitive. The action scenes feel like they come and go within one to two minutes. While those scenes do get us somewhere new, I wanted to see some longer fights between the Indians and the travelers. The repetition comes with a repeated cycle of travelling during the daytime and camping during the night. I don't have a problem with that cycle, but it just repeats too often throughout the film and its hard not to notice it.Either way you look at it, Hostiles is still an effective character driven experience that tests a group's ways of thinking.7/10",Hostiles

140,makleen2,Eulogy for the Old West,9,21 August 2018,"An embittered Army captain must escort a hated adversary to his distant homeland in Hostiles (2017), written and directed by Scott Cooper, based on a manuscript by Donald E. Stewart. Hostiles is a ""revisionist"" Western in the vein of Unforgiven (1992) and No Country for Old Men (2007). It is stark, gritty, and violent, focusing on survival in the vast western expanse. It is also a near-perfectly executed film; its main flaw being a tedious run time of two hours and 14 minutes.In a remote outpost in New Mexico, Col. Abraham Biggs (Stephen Lang) sends Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) on one final mission. The U.S. Army has kept Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and his family prisoner, but now the Cheyenne chief is elderly and cancer-ridden. Capt. Blocker and a small detail must escort them to Montana's Valley of the Bears. Blocker, on the verge of retirement, reluctantly agrees, despite decades of brutal warfare with the chief and his tribe.Their journey is complicated when they come upon Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike), whose family was slaughtered by rampaging Comanches. Together, they must overcome hardships and their own prejudices if they are to survive and make it to their destination. They encounter hostile Indians, hostile whites, and raging monsoons, and leave a trail of bodies in their path.Hostiles' story is about as straightforward as you can get: the protagonists travel from point A to point B, overcome obstacles along the way, and arrive at their destination with their perspectives changed. It would receive an A+ in any college screenwriting course. The film pays homage to the great Westerns that inspired it, at one point even taking a line of dialogue straight from Unforgiven: ""I've killed everything that's walked or crawled at one point,"" says Master Sgt. Thomas Metz (Rory Cochrane).The film takes place in 1892, less than two years after the Wounded Knee Massacre that ended the Indian Wars, which lasted for more than 30 years. The characters mention Wounded Knee several times when reflecting on their past. Yet the nation is already moving on, as evidenced by Minnie, wife of Lt. Col. Ross McCowan, lamenting the atrocities committed against American Indian tribes. She does this in front of Rosalee Quaid, whose husband and three children, including a baby cradled in her arms, were shot down in cold blood by Comanches. Rosalee seems to (unrealistically) take it in stride.Putting the past to bed is a major theme in Hostiles. At one point, the group stops at Fort Winslow, where they take custody of Sergeant Philip Wills (Ben Foster), who is awaiting court martial for massacring a Native American family. In contrast with Capt. Blocker, Wills is unable to let go of his hatred and his desire for revenge. ""It could have just as easily been you tied to this tree,"" he tells Blocker.But Blocker has metaphorically freed himself by cooperating with Chief Yellow Hawk and coming to terms with his past. Yellow Hawk, for his part, seems resigned to his fate. These warriors, who fought each other for so long, are all moving on to one final destination or another.If Hostiles suffers from anything, it's long stretches of inaction that do nothing to forward the plot. This movie could have easily shaved off 30 minutes of screen time, or used that screen time to develop the relationship between Capt. Blocker and Mrs. Quaid. There's a kernel of intimacy there, most clearly expressed in a short scene in which the two share a PG-rated moment. Including a bit more romance wouldn't have hurt. Life isn't always so bleak and depressing.In the end, Hostiles feigns moral ambiguity through constant illusions to characters' past transgressions, but it's always clear who wears the white hats and who wears the black. In that sense, it is a classic Western adapted for contemporary audiences. Hidden under this dark, violent facade is the simple story of a hero's journey, and simplicity is what makes this film so appealing.",Hostiles

Just in a matter of several days of travel, a hardcore native-hater(who's a field officer) becomes friends with the natives, a hotchpotch of themes - Indian Wars, PTSD, morality, brutality gives a sense of confusion on the screenplay writer's and director's part about what they exactly wanted to convey to the viewers.

Perhaps the film was a victim of the current cultural climate, wherein American caucasians are overly defensive, as the reviews here suggest, or perhaps the characters just weren't well thought out. Either way, as so often happens with movies nowadays, the trailer is better than the actual film. Bale plays a war criminal by todays standards, and the film overplays his dislike for the Native American race, while underplaying the historical brutality of his own side. Bales performance is restrained and uninteresting, with the supporting cast underused or veering to melodramatic. The film lacks suspense, and seems content to fill the screen with wide angle shots of the vastness of the beautiful landscape rather than focus on the characters themselves.

The beauty of this film is that our misconceptions of all players in this story go through a journey of change, however, the Native American philosophy holds true and their change is only in adapting to invasion. As somebody from the U.K. brought up on Americana, I have a strong empathy with the the indigenous population and their rights and treatment. The sad thing is once the invaders (like a virus) had killed the host, they moved onto the African Americans, who are suffering to this day.

I agree on the slowness part yet the satisfaction once the credit rolls (When Bale boards the Train) wouldn't be feasible if any moment of the movie is taken away. The movie is shot outdoors in beautiful unoccupied/empty location which in a way portrays the emptiness within the soldiers after the relentless war against Native Americans. Each supporting cast has done an amazing job to match up with Bale's commanding act. I wouldn't recommend the movie for anyone who don't have a good 02 hours to spare.

155,soundoflight,"It's an excellent film, well worth your time",8,16 April 2018,"It seems like a lot of critics panned this film because it didn't fit with their sensibilities, politics, or take on history. But that alone doesn't alone make for a bad film. I love westerns, and this is a fine one; perhaps the best I've seen in years. I'm sure it was not 100% historically accurate. Find me a western that is. I also find the political criticisms a little unfair. I've seen my fair share of preachy Hollywood ""social justice"" films lately, and I don't think ""Hostiles"" deserves to be lumped into that category. There really isn't much politics on display at all here, it simply portrays some of things life was about back then. That's what westerns are all about. In this case, that includes the tail end of the ""Indian Wars"" and frontier life. I think the story, the actors, the cinematography, and the settings all portrayed this wonderfully. That's why I think it's an excellent film. I also had no issues with the pacing of the film. I love films that take their time to tell a story, and again, it's a western (try Sergio Leone's pacing on for size if you think ""Hostiles"" is slow). I think what's actually going on here with the negative reviews is that the film dares to remind people of things they don't like to be reminded of. In that regard, the film pulls no punches, and it may be too much for some to handle.",Hostiles
156,fullheadofsteam,Well-intentioned but not centered,5,31 January 2018,"This is a beautiful movie in several respects, first with the homage to the best Westerns ever made, because it lavishes itself cinematographically on landscape as a primary character of the story, and secondly because it is driven as a morality tale, good vs. evil, with blurred lines becoming clarified and erased. And it must of course be said that Christian Bale's acting is superior and compelling. There are, unfortunately, flawed elements that ultimately lower this movie in both accurate portrayal but stretch the imagination to be sure, and thus it fails to meet the lofty heights touted by the TV advertising hype that it is the best Western since Unforgiven. In fact, both 3:10 to Yuma and Appaloosa both eclipse this film in gravitas. And here are some of the spoilers that drag the movie down from the loftier heights it's Director most certainly sought: The very opening sequence is unbelievable, as no man intent on protecting his family would wildly charge out of what could have been a barricaded position within his house to wildly run and shoot his rifle at a line of marauding Indians. :after in the film, women are abducted and apparently -- and here the film fails to make clear - raped by fur trappers -- without a mere peep no less scream heard from any of the women at the time of abduction, even though they had warning. More absurd is that when the good guys find where the abductors are camped, and holding the high ground train their rifles down upon the encampment, fail to simply fire upon and thus obliterate the bad guys when the bad guys emerge from their tents and start looking around because of a noise they heard. And finally, the movie is reduced to over-emotional, and so resultantly illogical sentimentality -- a sentimentality which we modern Americans most certainly have a sense of, but which hardened and violent Indians and U.S. Cavalry officers would not likely have experienced in 1892, and certainly the widow, unlike in this film, of an Indian massacre upon her family would not have developed a warm and fuzzy relationship with any Indians. It is, therefore, a wishful film and certainly may have greater appeal to a younger and more naive, based on removal from history in time, generation. And it is perhaps doubtful as well that any Native Americans over the age of 50 will be led to as cozy a relational feeling toward a former nemesis, meaning the U.S. Government, in the Government's war on them, the forced relocations and internments, as do the main characters of this film.",Hostiles

I saw the Hollywood films of Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich, John Sturges and later, the Italian-based movies of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. So as I was watching Hostiles, the new film by Scott Cooper, starring Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi, I kept thinking that Sturges or Aldrich could have told the same story in 90 minutes instead of 2 hours--and made it move. Because this film is verrrrrry slow and more than a little episodic: Every 30 minutes there's an act of random violence followed by scenes of riders walking their horses through gorgeous Western vistas or setting up then breaking down their campsites. That's the movie. As a woman whose family is wiped out by a group of renegades, Pike does fine work, though oddly the costume department decided to purchase her wardrobe from a fashionable, high end Western wear store. As a hard-bitten cavalry officer on the verge of retirement, Bale mostly grunts, glowers or poses against those same majestic vistas. And Wes Studi, playing a dying but stoic Cheyenne chief, is allowed the occasional cough to remind us he's sick.

I'm fine with that. Still, imo the movie has too many characters and tries to pack too many events into its story of a calvary captain tasked with bringing a Cheyenne Indian Chief from New Mexico to Montana. Some have complained that the film does not develop its Native American characters, and there's some truth to this . . . Probably because the movie moves through so many characters. Only three get much attention: the captain, the chief, and a white woman who has survived an Apache raid. That's fine, but even these three don't get enough development because there are so many other characters to account for. For instance, the chief is traveling with his daughter, his son, his son's wife, and his grandson. We have to learn a little something about each of them. Meanwhile, the captain leads a group of soldiers that grows and shrinks so much that I stopped bothering to learn their names. And then this combined group of travelers- the Native Americans, the calvary men, and the white survivor woman- encounter four varieties of deadly enemy. It's too much for one movie and the story just kind of collapses under its own weight. It seems to me that if the chief had been traveling with just his daughter and grandson and the calvary captain had been traveling with just a couple of soldiers, the movie could have accommodated its core story better and I might've felt more connected to its characters and story.",Hostiles
168,TheJediWay9,"A Slow Burn With An Excruciatingly Boring 2nd Act, But Solid Filmmaking",7,11 January 2018,"""Hostiles"" is a western written and directed by Scott Cooper, who directed films such as ""Crazy Heart,"" ""Out Of The Furnace,"" and ""Black Mass."" It stars Christian Bale as an Army captain in 1892 who is ordered to escort a dying Cheyenne Chief back to his homeland in Montana. This movie is a slow burn to say the least. In the first act and the third act, when the movie is slow, it is still interesting. It manages to keep my attention even though there are a lot of drawn out scenes. Characters take a long time to respond, sometimes a shot will last for what feels like an eternity. Even then, it's in these parts of the movie where I am still engaged. there are some gun battles sprinkled in throughout, but the little violence there is can be strong and explodes when you least see it coming. Speaking of, you should know how dark and breaking this movie is going to be judging from its opening scene. The opening hooked me, but it was surprisingly also a little overboard in terms of violent content. What happened there does serve the story and makes you care for Rosamund Pike's character. I didn't need to see what happened happen right from the get go.The send act of the movie though....colossal waste of time. It was boring. This is where scenes were failing to grab my attention. My attention was strained. Very little of the plot is moved along throughout this half hour. It's just the gang...hanging out... and Ben foster is there. This is where you can zone out of conversations characters are having. These scenes will put you to sleep. The story is definitely the weakest aspect of the film. When the film was rising to its conclusion, I sat there and thought to myself that this film has little to no stakes. There are multiple antagonists, and none of them rise to the occasion to seize the day as the ""big bad."" It really ended up leaving a hollow and sour taste in my mouth.The rest of the film though, from a technical and filmmaking standpoint, is a glorious achievement, there is no denying that. Beautiful, lush cinematography, a really well directed movie from Scott Cooper. The score is also beautiful but at the same time harrowing and sorrowful. The characters are really well thought out as well, and this is especially the case with Christian Bale, who along with Rosamund Pike and we can't forget Wes Studi give magnificent performances. Despite the overlong and clunky story, I did enjoy watching ""Hostiles"" and I am going to give ""Hostiles"" a B-.",Hostiles
169,stjackson10,6/10,6,17 March 2020,"Disclaimer: I watched this with in like five different sittings...There were a lot of things I thought were strong in this movie. I liked that it had ideas, and I appreciated that it tried things. I don't know that it all necessarily worked. It at times felts like it wasn't sure where it wanted to go or what story it wanted to tell. If it wanted to tell a story about barbaric mankind through the lens of native american oppression, then that is the most effective narrative. I was excited to see the likes of Jesse Plemons, Timothee Chalamet, Ben Foster, and Johnathan Majors, and when most of their characters were dead before I had the opportunity to build a relationship with them, the interpretation is either that they cared not about stewarding these amazing actors or they were trying to comment on the brevity of life and the suddenness in which death finds us - especially when we are late 19th century soldiers escorting ""prisoners"" across lands stolen from resentful natives.This movie demands to be taken seriously as it kills off eighty percent of a young family within the first ten minutes, but it does so ineffectively as we're confused rather than dismayed at the deceased adolescents. It beckoned us to care about Rosamund Pike's character because of her anguish, but it felt mismanaged.Another issue I had was the trouble I had understanding Christian Bale's muttering. I do understand that Bale's dialogue delivery had much to do with his character, but I draw the line when I need subtitles for English.Ultimately, I didn't hate the movie. I was a little confused about what it was trying to do or say at times, but there were things they did well and things that I liked, and I think a continuous viewing experience would be far more rewarding.",Hostiles
170,markkbranson,This One is NOT a Popcorn Movie: It Asks You to Think (and I Love it!),9,20 March 2019,"If you have seen my reviews, you know I like a free-refill popcorn movies as much as anyone. But as ""Hostiles"" (2017) is asking us and like my students will tell you, I also love movies that challenge my cognitively and emotionally. If you are game for this type of film and you are willing to relish the pacing, then come along for this Neo-Western that offers some of the same traditional Western images but in an emotionally charged and cognitively engaging manner.Certainly Scott Cooper's direction is schooled in the greats: John Ford (pick any he did with John Wayne, tho' clearly Cooper is playing with ""The Searchers"") and Sam Peckinpah (how can anyone ever forget the bloody, slow-motion images of 1969's ""The Wild Bunch""?). If you are a fan of westerns, watch for the grad vistas. the rugged looks (consider, for example, Christian Bale's wrinkles around his eyes and brown leathery skin in some of the close-ups), and the random violence.If you are NOT a western fan, there are things to consider too: look at the camera work, particularly early on where Cooper is using low key lighting for a chiaroscuro effect (think Da Vinci, Vermeer, and Rembrandt). The themes are right out of today's headlines (note the image of the children being incarcerated in the first part of the film; the sexual violence against women; white entitlement to property, and so forth).For me, two things are extremely compelling: first this film is a story of humanity searching for redemption. Humans are far more complex than we want to believe. This complexity is played out throughout this film: Bale seems a bigot, but he is seeking redemption. Rosamund Pike experiences unbearable horrors but stills feels something for others. Wes Studi has exacted revenge, but wants reconciliation and to die at his home. These questions are difficult to ferret out, but the film allows the time for the characters and the viewers to wrestle with these complexities.The other compelling idea is how Cooper et al takes John Ford's ""The Searchers"" (1956) and turns the film on its head. First, you cannot forget the opening epigrams from D.H. Lawrence about the violence in the American psyche. This point is driven home with a retelling of the opening scene in Ford's film. Throughout, we see this growing tension about violence. But at the end, unlike Ford's classic, we don't see the violence ""driven out"" like the door closing on John Wayne's face, we see redemption, but with an asterisk. Redemption is granted, but it acknowledges the violence instead of rejecting it like Ford.This latter part is hard to wrap one's head around: how can we be redeemed and be violent at the same time? That is the challenge of this film, so be forewarned that this movie is really wanting you to think. It does not offer the mythological past; it is a mirror held to our faces and asking us: ""what do you do?"" If you are willing to take this challenge, then come along and enjoy this long mental experience. If you are not, then load up ""The Wild Bunch"" and get your gore fix, which is what I might just do this weekend myself. See how complex we humans are???",Hostiles
171,paul-2148,Riveting character study,9,29 April 2018,"I don't understand the bad reviews of this film. It's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and it's a riveting character study of a soldier bound by his oath of duty, yet tormented by all the death he has both witnessed and been a party too. The film starts with a brutal Indian attack, and in today's PC culture it's a bit shocking to watch such a violent and heartless rendering of the American Indian. Of course the story is a lot more complicated that. I do not think this is a film about bigotry. It's a film about anger, revenge, and vengeance. It's a film about how we can overcome our instincts to irrationally strike back. It's also in a more subtle way a film about faith and redemption. 
It's also a cowboys and Indians story, and the film plays homage to the western as film genre. There's an obvious reference to The Searchers for example. Bale is terrific. It's a complex character. There's a whole back story to this guy that Bale often has to provide with only an expression. Just like there are back stories to every character in the film that are never revealed, but if you are paying attention you can kind of figure out. Pike is very good too. There's a love story that plays out that isn't based on sexual attraction as much as it is on mutual compassion and deliverance. This is grown up stuff, and in a way it's one of the best romances between a man and a woman who never even share a screen kiss.
This ultimately a western made by a filmmaker who likes westerns. It's hits all the points every western shoul, but it always avoids cliche. Evening the ending much like the ending in The Graduate, is in a way so expected and rooted for that when it arrives you are just left feeling a little unsettled.",Hostiles
172,wgingery,A Good Story Savaged by Sunday-School Piety,4,29 January 2018,"At some point in the fourth reel, this film slipped away from me. I stopped being a participant and became a critic: noticing the settings, costumes, and - kiss of death - the ""acting."" I watched to the end, but it never recaptured my full involvement.Which is a shame, because, behind the glibness, there is a worthwhile story.Back to the basics: (1) Monotony is, well, monotonous. Here, the pace and the tone feel rigidly programed: either #1 or #2: day or night, light or dark; ponderous solemnity mode or violent chaos mode; no shades of gray, no humor to lighten the mood, no irony or paradox to add depth. Ditto the people: 1 or 2, light or dark, sententiously philosophical or brutally violent (unless you're native american, in which case you are pretty much taken for granted).(2) Keep it moving: exposition is deadly, so give us only essentials.Cut all the prologue, where Quaid's (Pike's) husband and family are brutally slain. Yeah, we know you want to be evenhanded in acknowledging non-white terror on whites. But it is more dramatic and more involving for the audience to experience her from the same fresh, shocked, uncomprehending point of view as Capt Blocker (Bale) does. Likewise, cut the scene of Blocker's capture of the native american family (another glib attempt to seem evenhanded) and severely edit the exposition of Capt Blocker's assignment to escort Chief Yellow Hawk. Again, it's far more dramatic and involving to reveal the backstory and the animosity in real time, face to face. Which brings up the question: why don't you show us a scene of Chief Yellow Hawk performing red on white terrorism? Obviously, because that would destroy the audience's sympathy for CYH; and that would ruin the chance for reconciliation; which, in turn, would spoil the moral Sunday School lesson of the movie.Cut the easterner: adds nothing.With all the running time gained by cutting out the dead wood, you could actually round out the characters and fill in holes in the plot.(3) Don't patronize the audience by spelling it out;At one point someone gives a native american a pouch of tobacco, with the words: ""We've treated you shamefully. So I'm giving you this tobacco."" With that you flatten the emotional effect. Have enough confidence in us to let the audience have the pleasure of working it out.(4) What the audience wants to see is the characters dig down to their bedrock as they are forced to make hard choices; accordingly, we require conflict as the characters' expectations collide with reality. This film tends to take shortcuts.You want tearful farewells between men, one white, one black? Fine, we're OK with men expressing emotions, even a man expressing love for another man. But first show us - actually show us - what they've sacrificed for each other. No fair springing tears on us unprepared.You want to show us the first stirrings of sympathy for a stranger through an exchange of clothing? Make it count: prepare for it by showing us the development over time of the giver's change in attitude, and also what giving up the clothing means to the giver.The screenplay pops in plot points like pegs in a board. Too bad there's no forewarning of Blocker's murderous pal, or of the possibility that Bear Valley might be claimed by whites; result: the audience feels ambushed. How about a little plot construction? You want to use white fur trappers as villains? Fine, but let us in on it ahead of time that they might be in the neighborhood..There's more, but I hope you get the point. Sadly, the upshot was that I didn't exit the theatre with the insight that ""This is how Life works: a man can change; he can reclaim his humanity, even after a life spent doing a nation's dirty work, by acknowledging the humanity of others, even that of his greatest enemy."" Instead, it was more like ""Wouldn't it be pretty to think so?""",Hostiles

175,lefterisbeck,Forgiveness,10,15 December 2020,"A movie that is a progression of how the human spirit can actually forgive and move on. Captain Blocker is a veteran with a dark past from the past Native American wars; however, he is faced with a quest to take Chief Yellow Hawk and his family back to their home. A quest that is both challenging physically and mentally. Captain Blocker and Chief Yellow Hawk were rivals, so Captain Blocker holds deep anger from the past.
Captain Blocker and his crew save Rosalee and guide her towards finding peace after her family died in such a horrifying way. As the days progress, Captain Blocker realizes how to overcome hate and bury the dark past from the wars. At a very strong and emotional part of the film is when Tommy confronts Yellow Hawk and apologizes from the horrible events that happened in the past. At his last point in Tommy's life in tears he said sorry and felt deep remorse for the natives. Captain Blocker also felt that and which is why he told Yellow Hawk how a piece of him dies with him too. The breathtaking panoramic views, vistas and nature was such a spiritual journey along the film.
Captain Blocker did not give up and realized how he never did in fact had hate, but to him it was a job that he had to do; however, he strongly felt deep regret and that is why in the end he felt in love with Rosalee and took care of the Chief Yellow Hawk's grandchild too.

Outstripping any modern horror film with sheer gut wrenching tension and visceral violence. Rosamund Pike is sublime throughout, but this opening setup proves why she is one of the finest actresses currently working. Christian Bale is equally powerful as the disenchanted and racially entrenched cavalry officer charged with returning a Native American Chief (his sworn enemy) to his ancestral lands before he dies.The cinematography is clean and expansive, capturing the vast landscapes with characteristic western style but the story never falls into established cliches, staying gritty and realistic throughout.

Please spare me the "". . . you don't understand that Westerns are slow""; I've been a Western fan since Hoppy chased down the bad guys, and this movie just drags, it hits us over the head with the message, and it takes itself way too seriously to finish up with the Hollywood let's be friends, all is forgotten ending.Rosamund Pike turns in the only thing resembling a memorable performance, Wes Studi, the fine Indian actor, is reduced to subtitle grunts so trite that Indians must be wincing, Christian Bale is way over the top as he so often is, and the fine character actor, Ben Foster is reduced to a near-cameo role.Despite the harsh message and the inherent violence, surely no one really reviewed the screenplay for authenticity, e.g., as Scott Wilson (""In Cold Blood""-1967) rides up with his mongrel sons it's apparent to everyone what's coming, but even as Captain Blocker and Rosalie Quaid slowly draw weapons, one a rifle, the antagonists make not a single move toward drawing their own weapons. Gimme a break.Sound is woefully lacking as the audience struggles to hear/understand garbled dialog, hidden by mostly too-long mustaches. Anything resembling a road or trail was apparently still missing between New Mexico and Montana in 1892. And try not to notice that they take a train back . . .

178,Kolobos51,"Christian Bale is brilliant, but the movie...",5,27 January 2018,"I had read quite a bit about this movie leading up to seeing it this weekend but, curiously, had nod seen a single ad. All I really knew was the Christian Bale's performance was getting raves (big surprise), the basic plot synopsis, and that I had enjoyed Scott Cooper's previous films. I had a bit of a bad feeling going in that it might be slow, preachy, and obvious but considering one review came right out and said this was the best American Western of the last twenty years, I was cautiously hopeful. I should have listened to my instincts. Hostiles isn't as unbearably overlong and self-important as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, but it's close. In fact, it might not even be quite as good as that movie. At least I was fully engaged with all the characters in that film. In Hostiles, it really is just Bale and the people standing around him. The movie is way too long, very slow in the middle, and just not very engaging. I can't say I hated it because the acting is great all around, except for a badly out of her element Rosamond Pike. Rory Cochrane, Scott Wilson, Jesse Plemmons, Wes Studi, Adam Beach, Stephen Lang, Ben Foster, etc. all turn in great work even if their characters aren't that strong. And then there's Bale. Hostiles works best when thought of as really great showcase for the brilliance of Christian Bale, how natural, how carefully constructed, how emotionally raw, and at times remarkably subtle a performer he can be. I truly believe in the future his name will be mentioned in the same breath as Marlon Brando and Robert de Niro. But he really needs to find himself better material. Like Exodus, the last thing I remember seeing him in, Hostiles shows him doing great work in a barely okay movie. The problems I have with this movie are that the lead actress is stiff and awkward, playing a complex character whose arc does not even remotely land. The supporting characters are mostly disposable with only Cochrane, Studi, Foster, and a guy named Jonathan Majors who plays the sole black member of Bale's battalion really making any impact. The pacing is all off. The movie grabs you by the throat in the first thirty minutes then just kind of tapers off until the finale. And even then, the plot isn't nearly as smart or impactful as it thinks it is. Most of the time, you'll know exactly where a scene is going from the moment it starts. Honestly, I knew exactly where the movie was going after reading its plot synopsis on IMDB. Christian Bale plays a soldier ordered to transport some captive natives across Western country which he reluctantly agrees to do because he has been at war with natives in general and the chief, played by Wes Studi, specifically. And he picks up Pike's pretty widow along the way. If you watch movies, you can guess every beat pretty much from there. Brotherhood of man, whites are just savage as the native ""savages,"" romance blooms in unlikely places, etc. Oh, we're all awful for taking native land. The movie is just too proud of itself, too filled with Indie movie ""big important movie"" pretension to be as obvious as it is. I wanted it to surprise me, to deviate a little, to do just one thing I really didn't expect but it just doesn't. At least not until the last ten minutes of the movie when Scott Wilson rides in for his bit part.I can't say I didn't like the movie at all. I did actually really like the first third, Christian Bale is amazing, and there are great moments sprinkled throughout. I just wish Bale could get more work in better films. 
PS
Hey Hollywood. how about letting Bale and Tom hardy face off again, but without the masks this time. It would be a treat for film fans and almost certainly better than the last few Bale films released.",Hostiles
179,draciron,Dark and interesting.,7,8 September 2018,This is a dark moody movie that does an excellent job of capturing a tired soldiers last foray into soldiering. More plot detail is not really necessary and would be a spoiler. Just let this movie unfold and enjoy. The movie does a great job of portraying both sides of the conflict and making everyone human. If not for a few moments where the characters go off preaching PC politics I'd rated this an 8 or 9. Those moments took me completely out of the movie and it took some time to get back into the story. If I wanted to get preached at I'd turn on CNN or a televangelist. Outside of that the story unfolds in a captivating way. The characters seem real and are people you generally like or at least can understand. This is a rare hollywood movie where the action is actually exciting instead the so over the top as to be comedic efforts that Hollywood tends to produce over the last decade.,Hostiles

The performances by Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, and Wes Studi are way over the top! The cinematography is great, but not quite as good as it was with the previous mentioned ""Dances wtih Wolves"", but still some great scenes! The story is riveting and as myself had the whole audience glued to the screen, even at some of the quieter moments you could hear a pin drop. The stories dialouge at the fort was hard to follow at times, but once Captain Joseph Blocker had his orders to deliver his hated enemy home Chief Yellow Hawk the story quickened and never let you go on thier perilous journey. I found the relationships with the Captain's other fellow officers to be deep and well thought out, along with the deep seated history that they had experienced in the past with the so called hostiles. I can't give alway too much as I don't want to be a spoiler, but the story that unfolded following years of prejudice and hatred was one to remember as they all had to look deep into their souls! There are so many moments in the movie that will make you want to reflect on perhaps some of your own experiences. Kudo's to director Scott Cooper, the script, and actors for weaving this into a real gem. In the end I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 due to some slow dialouge in the beginning, and a few slow spots that could have been edited or left behind.

182,mertafor,Mediocre drama,6,24 April 2018,"After watching first 20 minutes, I've had high hopes for this movie. Because as everyone here mentioned already, Bale and Pike are doing a great job here. Acting is definitely superb and you expect something good is coming along. But I was terribly mistaken. Storyline and editing are so weak, just read the synopsis and you'll know what's going to happen at end of the movie. This is one of those rare examples how a movie with almost 130 minutes run-time can be this shallow. Many times I felt like movie is fast forwarding or some of scenes have been removed intentionally or unintentionally. Since this is a drama what you would expect here is deep character development. But even good acting doesn't help to save the movie from weak character development. It's fair to say that most of characters are just wasting screen time and have so little contribution to the story. Many times I asked myself ""What is this movie about for Christ sake? Why has this character introduced?"". Simply put, this is just another forgettable story about relation of two war veterans from different sides. I wouldn't say it's a huge waste of time but definitely unsatisfactory experience in the end.",Hostiles

And speaking of the female protagonist, this movie has proven to me that Rosalind Pike is a useless character actress. She is placed in so many roles where the entire character could have been removed form the story. She was useless here, did nothing but portray cliche after cliche and continuously annoyed me.
The story was a slow burner yes, but slow burners need to have a point in the end. The redemption was flimsy, the emotion was canned and story was bland.

184,stock-1,textbook slow walking,4,12 April 2018,"When not troubled and misled by official taught pre knowledge of the aftermath of the civil war, this movie will pass with flying colors as the text book example of what the slow-walking of tasks, duties and problems looked like in the 19th century. So how sluggish did Christian Bale in fact slow walk his obligations ? First the old Chief died of old age and yellow fever even before ever reaching Bear Valley, to never set eyes on his promised land ever again. Second, all of Capt. Blocker friends turn out to have died during his death march on horseback, a march at the speed of your typical Christian burial procession of US Presidents, or Godfathers . The viewer who has watched this to the bitter end should be handed the congressional medal for endurance. From previous movies we know that Rosamund Pike and Christian Bale did their finest performances in roles of dangerous psychopath's . The most saddening part is, that even though Rosalie openly had set eyes on Capt. Blocker - a name which could not have been chosen more wisely and striking, illustrating the chronic slow-walking by Bale - in the end after spending almost half of their lives together, Madame Quaid lost her three children and husband farmer at the beginning of this saga, the Captain is even still sleepwalking his decision whether he will start a relationship and new life with Rosalie Quaid. One wonders how Capt. Joseph J. Blocker ever was able to establish his stellar reputation with the Blue Jacket Army brass finest .. The most disturbing message which director Scott Cooper tries to carry through onto his ever more faster dwindling and dying audience, is his message of false guilt feelings for the native Indians, resembling the guilt laid upon Germans after the second world war. This sorry and pithy message simply is not true, as there has never been a true story recorded where another Indian Chief actually made an attempt to rescue Chief Yellow Bear from his deadly slow walking envoy to the eternal hunting fields.",Hostiles
185,getconedproductions09,A trip into regret,7,20 May 2019,"Hostiles
Directed by Scott Cooper. Written by Scott Cooper and Donald E. StewartI've been shying away from this movie for quite some time. Scoot Cooper's work is usually pretty bleak and somber. I'm down for that. I usually seek that material out. It was also a Western which I like for the most part. I'm a fan of Christian Bale's work and so what the hell?! Time to hop on the horse and embark on the journey.This movie is about a reluctant Army captain forced to trek with a Native American family to their home. The captain and the chief have fought in wars against each other. They come bearing a lot of animosity and hatred towards each other. The chief and his family are more resigned and calm about things. The officers on the other hand are still as angry as can be. This is something that begins to fade away as they make their journey running into many obstacles along the way. This is the final journey for many. Is redemption a possibility for these people?While there are bouts of violence, this is a calm and quiet movie. These men have lived their entire lives knowing that you don't show emotion outwardly. They bottle these things up and it manifests in dark ways. You can see on their faces and man there are some masterful performances in this one. Christian Bale has a scene with one of his injured soldiers in a hospital that shows the history between these two men and what that means to have lived the harsh life they did. The blood that was shed between the two of them. It is heart felt and you completely understand the pain and admiration expressed even as Bale holds back his emotions and his tears.Rory Cochrane is the other performer in this movie that shines. He has his own scene with Wes Studi who plays the chief in an act of atonement. He takes drastic action when one of their own commits against them. He speaks to the Chief in his own language and everyone is there in his body language and his eyes. Regret, shame and hopefully some form of forgiveness.This is a wonderful movie. The cinematography is really stunning. The vistas are proudly painted across the screen. The movements are all deliberate and meaningful. That's how you know when you're in the presence of something great. I really liked this one as if you couldn't already tell. I give it a B.",Hostiles
186,alihandemiral,"A fine western story, nevertheless, it is full of white-power propoganda.",7,15 April 2018,"As a fan of Scott Cooper's Black Mass and Out of the Furnace, I found Hostiles an unfulfilling cinematic experience. The basis of the story is solid: A dying Cheyenne chief in captivity (Studi) requests being buried in his homeland as his last will, and the President accepts it. The job of giving the chief and his family safe passage across the country is given to a soon-to-be-retired, Native American-hating soldier (Bale) as his last mission in the Union Army. It's all great up to now, we see Bale's character evolving over time, instead of blindly hating the cheyennes who killed his brothers in arms over the years, he learns to respect the chief and his people therefore, they cooperate against the deadly comanches who pursue them. There are pretty cool scenes here and there; the chief and his son single handedly destroying the comanches in the night and leaving them for the union soldiers to see as a sign of their prowess in battle, Ben Foster's ""guest"" performance as a soldier who is after bloodshed and so on. But the ending turns things sour. The family of the Chief is destroyed in its entirety in an instant gunfight with a few ranchers, apart from the chief's grandson. Bale's character turns 180, and gives this child the biography of ""Julius Caesar"" as a keepsake. The child is not only adopted by the white woman whose family was butchered by the comanches, but also he is given one of the symbol of the Western culture as a gift by Bale's character, which is supposed to be one of the ""great Americans"". The child loses all ties to his Cheyenne roots and steps into the great task of becoming a ""modern American"". Despite all this propoganda, Scott Cooper's skillfull directing, the fine writing, the cinematography and the powerhouse performances of Christian Bale and Wes Studi makes this western highly enjoyable for the genre's followers.",Hostiles
187,linda-frances,Grim viewing,8,6 February 2019,"This film was well acted and had a lot to say about how our views of others are affected by war, this drives us to act inhumanely to those we view as enemies. How the viscous cycle of atrocities and vengeance goes around and round. This small group of travelling companions on either side get to know each other on a human level and small kindnesses and facing common enemies changes their views on each other. The injustices towards the native Americans felt so much worse towards the end of the film as I got to know them better. The white woman was welcomed and taken care of kindly in a nice cosy room. Whilst the Native American woman who had been brutally beaten was put in a prison cell with her family, one an old man dying of cancer.If you want to be educated, it's a must see excellent drama, but if you want to be entertained, choose another film.

188,garretsr,Little action; Plot only works if no characters had ever been in,3,11 February 2018,"This isn't the worst movie I've seen, but it's near the bottom. The movie dragged on and on with long pointless introspection. The occasional actions scenes were brief and sometimes boring.The plot only works if you accept that, decades after the Colorado War (""war"" with native Americans from 1863-1865), all of the area from New Mexico to Montana is so incredibly dangerous that everybody one meets outside of a town will be a ruthless killer. This is juxtaposed with the fact that the area is so incredibly civilized that nobody takes basic measures preparing for violence. This applies to all of the characters, even the ""bad guys"" seem intent on getting themselves killed. Characters repeatedly fail to take even basic precautions when they know that they are in mortal peril. It's like the characters read the script, know that they are destined to die, so just don't care enough to try to prevent it. The characters are so oblivious that one wonders if the writer, Scott Cooper, had ever scene a violent film or TV show, seen a western, or even been on an elementary school playground as a kid. Here's are some real-world writing hints that most writers would have figured out:1. When people are in dangerous areas where they might get massacred, they tend to keep weapons on hand.
2. When unarmed women and children are in the middle of a massacre, they tend to run away, fast.
3. When sociopaths come across a larger, well armed, military convoys, they usually avoid it.
4. When psychotic sociopaths kidnap women from a larger, well armed, military convoys, they try to hide or they find a defensible position.
5. When anybody attempts to threaten or kill well-armed military convoys, they don't give idle threats so the military personnel can prepare, don't threaten the military personnel then let them draw their weapons, don't threaten the military from an open, clustered, indefensible position, and don't keep posturing when the military personnel have drawn weapons and are aiming at them.",Hostiles

Understanding is impossible in the make believe world of 1892 when Comanches were actually no longer massacring white settlors. And forgiveness never really comes.This fantasy Western does as much damage to the history of the West as the sanitized westerns which minimized the genocide of Native Americans and the cruelty and duplicity of the United States Government.Even the ending is a cheat. Our now retired Army Captain finally gets on that train to join the heterogenous -- and fantasy -- family that unremitting human brutality has created.The director thinks of himself as a modern John Ford. Not even close. He confuses the sluggish pace of his story telling, punctuated by five acts of horrendous violence -- for the pacing of Ford. Please. The director's hubris is pathetic.Properly cut and tightened up, this would have been a tight 95 minute movie with the redeeming qualities it lacks in its lazy trot through the meadows of the foothills of the Rockies.

No complaints about the acting and the photography was outstanding.The director leaned toward low light scenes and a paucity of dialogue.I wondered about Comanche attacks in 1892. By then they had long been pacified. I also wondered what a Cheyenne chief was doing in New Mexico. And his homeland was in Montana? Wyoming, also areas in Colorado and Nebraska but not there. Captain Blocker (Christian Bale) displayed great changes in character, ranging from compassion, generosity, and love to brutality and vicious throat cutting murder.

And when they do go off the fights are bloody, brutal and quick.Christian Bale gives one of his best performances in this movie. Definitely nomination worthy if you ask me. Most of Hostiles is a road trip through dangerous lands populated by cutthroats and bandits. The movie is suitably bleak and there is hardly a moment of levity that can be found.There are some changes that the characters go through in the movie.

I'm certainly no history buff, so I will trust what other reviewers say about the films inaccuracies. And to the degree with which they are, maybe the filmmaker could've made a different movie or at least changed the names, to make the same points. But I don't think the point of this movie was about being historically accurate. That's why it attracted the talent it did. It's about getting a sense for what living in that time might have been like and tolerance towards others we don't understand so well. Hostiles is also supposed to be about how tough/fragile the human spirit is in the face of many events of seemingly impossible obstacles. Only instead of being set in our time, it chose the past as its lens to be viewed. And in that case, I think it succeeded brilliantly.The decision at the end that Bale's Blocker makes, is about the importance of choosing to pursue personal happiness over what became a less meaningful duty. Bale's character was the best soldier until the end when even life had broken down the last of him and he capitulated to what he thought might bring his mind more peace.This audience probably didn't need to know the exact date when the Cheyenne were being taken for the movie to have as much impact.Despite the apparent inaccuracies, I still think this was an extraordinary film.",Hostiles

Heroically, yet stupidly, he faces his attackers and is brutally butchered. As her children are shot one by one, the mother runs into the forest and hides, later to encounter Captain Joseph Blocker who is... escorting a group of natives back to their birth ground.This movie is the absolute opposite of the classical Western-genre and it's astonishing! It's gritty, it's gruesome and it's emotional. Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike treat us with profound performances and the script provides a patient narrative that slowly but surely connects conflicting ideas and poses uncomfortable questions. The indigenous characters, however, are underdeveloped and the lack of conflict between Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and Captain Joseph Blocker (Bale) makes their scenes together rather bland. But the scarce dialogues are touching and the silences have us contemplate on the characters, the story and history.It took a moment to get used to the crisp digital image in combination with the historical setting of the story, but once used to it, it definitely added to the realism. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi deliberately keeps a low profile, but is efficient and beautiful and shows realistic set pieces, astonishing real life landscapes and captivating close ups. Underneath this plays an extremely uninteresting score by Max Richter that tells no story of its own and means nothing more than filling of the silence. This is a movie that could benefit from less music and more silence.Hostiles moves slow, but rewards the audiences patience with hard feelings and sometimes painful to watch moments.

203,mkelly54,A Parable of Our Times,9,30 January 2018,"The violence in Hostiles is, at times, overbearing and incomprehensible to those who live in early 21st Century. The story takes place in the late 19th Century with the southwest and plains states serving as the backdrop for a series of vignettes transforming one time enemies to grudging acceptance and, finally, spiritual grace. A subtle allegory of racial stereotyping lends itself to our country's current conundrum of DACA and who is and who isn't accepted in our society. And who is and isn't morally sound in mind and spirit. Christian Bale's portrayal of a Cavalry officer burdened by his violent career, searching for a sense of peace and purpose is stoic, understated; perhaps too nuanced for some viewers to comprehend. Rosamund Pike is an accomplished actor who, much like Bale, steps into every role with the ease of Streep or Hanks. In this instance, Pike is rushed into a hellish nightmare anyone would struggle to overcome. Her quiet resilience is equally nuanced, and her ability to reach past obstacles with indomitable will is a haunting performance. Wes Studi's career is a consistent path on the exploration of strife and the interplay of Native Americans in an overwhelmingly white world. As Cheyenne Chief Yellow Hawk, Studi's stoicism is matched with a desire to end his days in his ancestral home, with family and tribe providing comfort. The story has links to previous works The Searchers, Stagecoach, Cold Mountain, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and The Road ... tales of long, violent, journeys with the end always over the far horizon. I'm disappointed Hostiles hasn't received the positive reviews it deserves, and I'm equally disappointed that Bale, Pike, and Studi did not receive well deserved Oscar nominations.

HOSTILES is a modern masterpiece, due many thing, such as the story and even the visuals, which are breathtaking. But what truly makes this film special is the characters. It is rare that a movie feature such well written character development. Blocker is said to have done some bad things, some of which he thinks is justified. But he also show deep compassion and character at other times. As for Rosalee's character, I suggest you just watch the movie. Near perfect film",Hostiles
210,ardentayu,Incredible Gray Area Account,8,2 January 2019,"There is no black and white in this movie. It is ALL gray area and that is what makes it so powerful. The story is that in the late 1800's an Army soldier (Christian Bale) has to bring a Cheyenne chief and his family through dangerous territory. Early on, they encounter a woman (Rosamund Pike) who's entire family has been slaughtered by Natives. There are no ""cowboys and bloodthirsty Indians"" here. And there is no statement about the evil white man taking over the innocent Natives. It shows how BOTH sides - all sides - have the capability for hostility and compassion. The late 1800's was a dangerous, heartbreaking time to be alive and this movie shows that. It's the kind of film that can open up deep conversations about the past, and despite its violence, I feel like it should be required viewing in high schools. Rosamund Pike's performance was brilliant.The only reason I give it an 8 and not a 9 or 10 is because it's so sad and heavy that I won't ever rewatch it. So while it does its job of teaching amazingly well, it doesn't do as good of a job as a piece of entertainment. But perhaps all movies don't need to do that.",Hostiles

216,FallonTimberlake2016,Christian Bale shines in emotional journey that has a powerful and relevant message.,9,30 October 2017,"Hostiles is a period piece that stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike and many others. It centers around an Army captain who hates Native Americans that is asked to escort a Cheyenne chief and his family to the reservation in Montana that they were previously from. The film starts off with a deeply disturbing scene where a family, including children, is massacred by Indians, which sets the tone for a very emotional, disturbing, and even sometimes uplifting journey that questions who the real hostiles are. The real highlight here is, of course, Christian Bale, who can convey a world of emotion with just one expression. Bale is easily Oscar- worthy and should definitely get at least a nomination. Whenever Bale controls the scene it is riveting.Rosamund Pike also nails it as the lone survivor of the attack described earlier. She exhibits grief better than even the most experienced of actors. Hostiles has a great message that is especially relevant in today's dividing times. The film is about inclusion, and shows that we are all human no matter how evil one may seem. However, this movie is not without its flaws. It's very slow at times, and there are entire scenes that feel like they don't need to be in the film. Luckily, whenever the film starts to slow down, within the next scene or so something happens that makes it more interesting. Hostiles is a heavily emotional experience that will make you think about long after it is done. Despite the heavy subject matter, it has an uplifting message, and pull some great performances from the main actors.I give Hostiles an A-.",Hostiles

218,kevinthecritic,"Hostiles: Well-Shot Western is Slow, Aimless",4,25 April 2018,"2 out of 5 stars (has some good moments, but is overall bad)Hostiles is one of those movies that was made with dreams of Oscar gold. It has dependable leads in Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike, an endless number of gorgeous wide shots of the Arizona landscape, and engages in brutal acts of violence to bring home the harshness of the 1800s. That's all well and good, but even the best cinematography or dedication to realism will mean nothing if everything around it feels weak. Hostiles has beautiful cinematography, a dedicated (if underwhelming) performance from Christian Bale, and desires to have a deep emotional impact, but fails due to limited characterization of the supporting cast and a slow, meandering storyline that, despite the best of intentions, is nowhere near as powerful as it believes.Bale plays Army Captain Joe Blocker (sporting an overdone moustache and taking the strong silent character type to a whole new level), a man on the brink of retirement ordered to escort a dying Native American chief (Wes Studi) and a few tribal members back to their homeland. Having experienced the rough brutality of Native Americans in battle, Blocker is antagonistic towards his charges, but follows his duty like the good soldier he is. Little does he know the hardships about to be thrust upon him, risking his own life as well as the lives of his perplexingly underdeveloped recruits and a damaged woman (Pike fully disappearing into her character) who slowly, but surely begins to open his long-cold heart.The Western is an odd beast in the modern cinematic landscape. While the 1950's and 60's saw a surge of these films, cultural tastes changed against the genre's favor, decreasing the number that were made, at least until the 2010's. This decade has seen an unexpected revival of the Western genre, with directors either setting them back in the proper period or in modern day while still retaining the essential elements: atmospheric, thoughtful pieces that emphasize character and theme over violence. While I can give some credit to this film for attempting to take a traditionally action-oriented story from a different perspective, I feel more action was needed to bring home just how much danger the characters were in, rather than have meaningless shots of them sitting in their tents giving ""Oscar stares"" to the camera.Hostiles' Achilles Heal is its inability to provide us with anyone of interest outside the two leads. Worse still, it slowly dawned on me that I only liked those two characters because they were played by actors I've enjoyed elsewhere. The other characters feel like window dressing so it's not just Bale, Pike, and the Indians walking around. They never come into their own as individuals and thus left me cold to some of their deaths. As much as Christian Bale cries (and with good reason), I was never invested enough to feel his pain the way the movie wanted me to. Pike has more luck, delivering a well-tuned performance as a woman totally broken and sympathetic. She brings more to the role than what's on the page, making me wish the film would have been from her perspective rather than Bale's.The scenes of violence are tough, but completely unmemorable. Writer-director Scott Cooper seems uncomfortable during these sequences, never allowing one to last long enough to have large impact. This leads to an inconsistent sense of danger, as far too much time is spent watching the men sit around a campfire, sleep, or discuss their faith, and not nearly enough on building character or a mounting sense of dread, something that defines the best Westerns. On a final note, the dialogue delivery is so labored that it induced several moments of unintentional humor for me. The actors will take awkward pauses in the middle of sentences as if they can't remember their lines, making the material drag out far longer than necessary. I never lived in the old west, but I'm pretty sure men had conversations faster than these guys.Hostiles is a beautifully-shot yet cripplingly slow Western with acceptable performances and a meandering narrative that keeps it from achieving its desired emotional gravitas. Fans of the genre, Bale, or Pike may enjoy this, but it offers little for anyone else.Rated R for Strong Violence and Language",Hostiles
219,Chris_Middlebrow,History and Geography Problems,1,13 January 2018,"The script writer is from the U.S. east coast (Virginia), and the script appears to be telling in that regard. Reviews at Indian Country Today are pleased at how the Cheyenne captives being returned to their homeland are portrayed. I concede that, but otherwise the movie plot is historically and geographically preposterous from the get-go. The writer apparently has never studied Wikipedia, much less read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown or An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. The premise of massacre of white settlers (1) by Comanches, (2) in 1892, (3) in either eastern New Mexico or a well-watered part of other New Mexico, fails. The Comanches were subdued in northwest Texas and adjacent eastern New Mexico by the late 1870s, and thereupon fled to Mexico. Moreover, preceding atrocities alluded to and productive of Captain Blocker's initial Indian hatred were mostly the other way around, which is to say a preponderance of white atrocities (Brown, Dunbar-Ortiz, Wikipedia). I didn't catch the dialogue exactly, but at one point in the movie I thought the name Billy Dixon came up as a Captain Blocker friend the Indians supposedly had killed in savage fashion. If I have that wrong, then I have that wrong. But if I have it right, the fact is that Dixon was one of the hunters who nearly exterminated the bison, who mainly fought Indians who were trying to stop such extermination, and who died ultimately in his 70s of old-age pneumonia. Then, without going through or across the Rockies from New Mexico to Montana, which thus requires traveling through eastern New Mexico, eastern Colorado, and eastern Wyoming, the cavalry and the Cheyenne they're escorting traverse a mixture of semi-arid lands with topography, or apparent Rockies foothills with trees. They somehow don't cross many major roads or trails, somehow don't encounter many other people or signs of white civilization, and somehow miss or mostly miss Colorado Springs (where ""America the Beautiful"" was composed in 1893), Denver, Cheyenne, and Laramie. At best, this puts them farther east on a route through the mostly treeless and mostly flat far western Great Plains, except that's not scenery that's in their journey or the movie. Parts of the movie that weren't filmed in the New Mexico or Colorado Rockies, or vicinity, were filmed in Arizona which is not on the way to Montana.",Hostiles

223,codexniagra,"Nearly, not quite.",7,18 September 2021,"I want to respond to the people debating the PC agenda this film may or may not have; it definitely does feel awkward in how Jonathan Major's character is treated. I have nothing against films being progressive and I understand the narrative need to show that Blocker isn't simply racist but a product of war early on, but the aesthetic is too grizzled and ""realistic"" for it to make sense. You could have the same device but make it work better, a more subtle indication than this unrealistic and on-the-nose way, somehow. There's just something missing.Which is also the issue I have with the rest of the film. This is Blocker's journey of discovery as he and his men come to realise that the people they hate are just people like them and that white men are also capable of being vicious and yadda yadda. Yes okay that's perfectly fine for a plot arc but none of the redemptive beats feel earned. They just change their minds over the course of some shots of horseback riding through the countryside. What little does happen feels in no way near enough to erase the hatred instilled by the character's pasts.You can see the outlines of it there, the idea that anything is justified if it's your job (an oddly Nuremburg-defence-based morality) and not otherwise, but it doesn't come through strongly enough.

It has so much relevance to present day affairs. Rosemund Pike deserves an oscar for her outstanding performance and Christian Bale, Wes Studi and each member of supporting cast became the characters themselves as such there is no artificiality in their performances.

This sublime piece is no different. Cooper manifests poetic vehemence through his characters and narrative landscape, whilst the natural landscape is lensed with the utmost grace and depth by DP Masanobu Takayanagi. Max Richter provides yet another arresting score which was predictably ignored by the Academy.

As always, the landscape is an important backdrop, and it is shown in all its beauty, and solitude. Bale, one of our best actors, inhabits this character believably, in one of his best performances. Others do equally well in presenting an engaging story, with the possible exception of Rosalind Pike, who struggles a bit to resemble a pioneer wife. Having grown up on Darlin' Clementine, The Ox Bow Incident, and Shane, that for me at least still stand at the pinnacle of the genre, I found this film very worthwhile, and watchable.

Rosamund Pike plays a grief-stricken lady, who must deal with her loss, and find strength to push through every day.

He glares and glowers, and speaks occasionally...most convincingly when conversing in Apache (who knew? The guy is a genius) to his dying captive, Yellow Hawk, played by the always reliable Wes Studi. This film is chock-full of some really awful behavior, which is meant to be offset by the nagging regrets of some of the white perpetrators, and by the humanity, dignity, and compassion of the Yellow Hawk's extended family, who are uniformly splendid folk, just a sweet bunch.

A small group of young Comanche Indians have left the Indian Nation in Oklahoma Territory and crossed into New Mexico where they slaughter and steal from everyone who crosses their path. We watch in horror as a beautiful family falls victim to this gang of young and aimless males who became bored on the reservation and see no future for themselves other than brutally killing and robbing innocent people.Meanwhile the President has pardoned Chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and grants the Cheyenne chief's request for safe passage to his former home in Montana. The task of getting Chief Yellow Hawk to his destination falls Captain Joseph J Blocker (Christian Bale). Captain Blocker, who has spent his military career fighting hostile Indians, objects but finally agrees to accept the assignment. The journey is very difficult and places everyone of the characters in extreme jeopardy as they face the gangster Comanche youths, a disgusting group of trappers, and a rancher with an ominous sense of entitlement.The movie has good and reliable actors doing an excellent job playing some difficult roles. Rosamund Pike (as the massacre survivor, Rosalie Quaid) does a wonderful job portraying someone who has the strength to pull herself from an extreme depth of despair and depression to where she is again a very strong woman. And, we believe this can happen because Ms. Pike plays the part so well. Christian Bale (Captain Joseph J Blocker) has a challenging role in the movie because he must play both a sympathetic male (to Rosamund Pike's character) and also a ruthless killer (responding to the horrible events he has witnessed in his efforts to protect settlers). Bale does both roles very well. He makes you feel his pain for the survivors and his anger at the perpetrators.The plot has couple significant ""holes."" Why not use the railroad to transport Chief Yellow Hawk and the Army detail to protect him? Would the US Army send a detail going a thousand miles with only 5 soldiers and 2 pack mules?

249,jcuddylamoree,Photography & convincing body language,8,1 September 2018,"I have to admit to being a bit of a neophyte when it comes to critiquing actors and movies, so though I have seen Christian Bale in his movies, I've never read what anyone else had to say about him. You don't need a critic to tell you what to think of Hostiles. Bale's body language is so convincingly appropriate to what one might expect for the culture of that specific historical context and that specific character. Both history and character were finely tuned into the equally convincing ensemble that made up the story's social context. Then all of this in a stunning frame of beautiful beautiful photography that thrilled with vast grandeur in which intimate character portraits were as much part of the mountains and sky as the leaves on the trees are. Yes, I felt a couple of short comings in the film, probably having to do with some worry elicited by a couple of religious references that fortunately didn't actually turn into the usual boring moral pedantry, but the shortcomings are strongly offset by the non-verbal perfect physicality of Bale's stoic lead, the nearly perfect pitch of the character ensemble, and the beautiful fit of gorgeous framing.",Hostiles

At the beginning Joe Blocker has every reason to hate the Indians. By the end of the film he has turned 180 degrees and his attitude towards how the Indians have been treated completed changed.Both this film and D.W.W have a subdued pace (though some would say ""boring"") with intermittent action sequences.",Hostiles

The cinematography is exceptional, meanwhile Christian Bale is superb playing a army captain who is seemingly tough and unflinching but shows an undertone of melancholy, Rosamunde Pike pulls of a great performance as a woman thrust into the ugly world of war and anarchy by a brutal attack on her family home, a scene is exceptional and unapologetically shocking.

256,michael-gz,An exemplary work of Film.,10,26 February 2018,"I recently saw this Film online and I was immediately stuck to the screen from beginning to end. Hats down to Scott Cooper for taking the most amazing writer Donal E Stewart's work and making it a reality on big screen. I am positive that if he were alive today, he would have been overjoyed to see such a masterpiece of a Film. The most important thing I must to not out here is how love was portrayed through out the Film. In a world full of hate and cruelty, sometimes we allow anger to kick in as a defense mechanism but when you are put in a situation such as the characters in the Film, your blinders begin to fall off and the truth starts to set in. I loved this Film for this sole reason and consider it to be one (if not the best) in 2018 though it was released in 2017. The silent moments between the characters show that you do not need to say a word to convey what you are thinking of saying, the pure human emotion and facial expressions say it all for you. The ending was the best movie ending I have seen since watching movies from the 70's and 80's when they still had (human) feelings, rather than today's reliance on CGI and sound SFX to prove ego over human emotion. 'Hostiles' gave me a sense of new hope in Motion Pictures and I hope that many new Filmmakers follow this path and keep it alive. Bravo! Very well done.",Hostiles

261,KingKongKyle,The Effects of Death Exlpored,9,8 February 2018,"*Review: Hostiles*Opening your film with what will be the most intense or disturbing scene in the movie is risky. It can affect the intensity of your climax later and it puts the audience at unrest right from the get go. But that is exactly writer/director Scott Cooper's intention. Hostiles opens with one of the most violent scenes I can recall outside of the war and horror genres. It will make you uneasy and have you wondering, ""what exactly have I signed up for?"" This story takes place in a violent world; a world where even the best of men are dangerous men with blood on their hands. Cooper wants you to understand that, and to feel that from the start. And he accomplishes this with great precision.Hostiles follows renowned Army Captain Joseph Baker (Christian Bale) who is assigned the task of transporting a dying Native American Chief (Yellow Hawk played by Wes Studi) to his homeland in Montana where he can die in peace. This detail also includes transporting the Chief's family which includes his son (Adam Beach), daughter, daughter-in-law and grandson. Baker does not want this assignment. Yellow Hawk has been a war prisoner for some time, captured no doubt by Baker himself. The two men have seen each other commit violent acts against each other's soldiers and friends. There is understandable animosity between them and despite Baker's insistence that he does not want this mission, he has little choice in the matter if he wants to retire from the Army with his record unscathed and his pension intact. As his commanding officer, Colonel Briggs (Stephen Lang) tells him, ""This will be done. And it will be done by you.""Not long after the Captain, his small team of soldiers and Yellow Hawk's family start their journey, they find Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike), a woman in dire straits after just witnessing the murder of her entire family and the burning of her home at the hands of another Native American tribe. Baker and his men know they must take this woman with them, not just to protect her from further attack and the elements, but to protect her from herself. All of this takes place in the first fifteen minutes of the film. The rest I will leave you to discover on your own.For a movie that runs nearly a quarter past two hours, it is a wonder how it never drags. Had the film been released more in line with the awards season time frame, editor Tom Cross may well have seen his way to a few ceremonies. As would cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi, who has made a film so gorgeous that even the close-up shots look amazing. When it comes to the beautiful landscape, this is probably the best-looking Western since Open Range. The score by Max Richter is very subtle, it fits the tone of the film perfectly, never feeling intrusive, but not unnoticed.Every actor in this film is giving one of their finest performances. I'd go as far as to say this is Christian Bale's best performance since The Machinist, which is saying a lot since he's given so many great performances in between. Rosamund Pike's portrayal of a tortured soul feels authentic and heartbreaking. Wes Studi, Adam Beach, Rory Cochrane, Jonathan Majors, Stephen Lang, Jesse Plemons and Ben Foster all have opportunities to shine in smaller roles. Cochrane in particular shines as a soldier whose life of killing has finally taken its toll mentally and physically.Hostiles may just come across as depressing to some viewers. It is dark and violent and there is little levity to speak of. There is so much death on screen that at times the movie seems like it is a story about death. And in a way it is. The acts of violence in the film happen quickly, but the repercussions of those acts are dwelt upon. We bear witness to the effects of death in its various forms. As such the film becomes more than just a story about death, but one about our reconciliation with mortality; our understanding of an outcome that is inevitable for us all one way or another.Scott Cooper has created one of the best films of 2017. A haunting, emotional Western that you will not soon forget. A film that looks this good and that is this emotionally engrossing deserves to be seen on the big screen. And a film this well-made deserves an audience. So get to it. 9/10",Hostiles

263,terminalsofa,Brutal and intense.,8,16 May 2020,"There might be equal billing for others of the cast but this is undoubtedly Christian Bale's film. That said, the cast is superb throughout, and Scott Cooper's direction is full of empathy with many assured touches.
Christian Bale captures perfectly the conflict and doubt of one who does bad things in the course of duty, although at no point does he offer that up as an excuse for what he has done. The film evolves at a slow pace and at times evokes an almost dream-like quality, inspired by the landscape, which more than once put me in mind of Herzog's classic, Aguirre: Wrath of God. Interspersed are episodes of raw violence, which are not in the least bit glamourized or sensationalized, making them even more shocking.
The film explores multiple themes surrounding human relationships and it is to everyone's credit that there is never any feeling of falseness or contrivance in the way those relationships evolve. In particular, the bonds that grow between the main characters perfectly capture the central trope of basic human decency.
I wouldn't argue with anyone who felt that it could lose 10 minutes, but I was never bored. There is some fine cinematography, and if one or two scenes are a little clichéd, the landscape almost dictates it and they are in any case so well handles that they don't jar at all.
SPOILER ALERT! (Read no further if you have not yet seen this movie.)
My one small quibble is with the ending, and I wonder if the film might have been conceived with an alternative ending. In the final scene, I was steeled to endure the same tearing of the emotions as I did at the end of ""The Remains of the Day"", where I would be shouting at the screen ""Get on the train! Just get on the train!"" So when he did, I felt a bit cheated. Or maybe I'm just a sad emo.",Hostiles
264,thejacobmello,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,7,8 February 2018,"Hostiles opened with a BANG! Or, more accurately, a THWUSH! Early in the first sequence - before I so much as had a chance to rip the cellophane off my Raisinetes box - we were forced to watch as a mother cried over the remains of her barbarically murdered offspring. This was sort of a chickenshit way of getting us to empathize and build a connection to a protagonist (and the second time a movie has pulled that stunt this weekend) but it's certainly effective. It was a great way of catching us up and letting us taste the hatred and pain that rested on the tongues of everyone encompassed in this story.There was a lot to like about this movie, particularly in the first act: the characterization was riveting, the acting was strong on all fronts, and they did a remarkable job at giving us an honest look at how bigotry and hatred can manifest in people and groups, without judging or excusing either side for their prejudices. While the first act was strong, and the setting of this story was ripe with dramatic potential, the second half of the movie stalled, making the movie, as a whole, OK at best.Like most road trip movies, this one simply ran out of things to do while on the journey. Partly due to the fact that this film was a good 40 minutes too long - most of which consisted of quiet establishing shots of horseback trotting and sitting outside of makeshift tents in silence. At one point a side character pulls out a mandolin and plays a folk song in its entirety. It was also partly due to the fact that this films idea of conflict and resolution were things like having their greatest external threat eliminated by showing two good guys give each other a covert look and then just cutting to the bad guys hanging from a tree in the next scene.This film had a great sensibility and it rallied in the closing minutes, but like all of writer/director Scott Cooper's work, there's a much better version of this movie resting on the cutting-room floor.Prescriptions

Christian Bale is in top form here, and his performance as well as the rest of the cast is great. It's beautifully shot and the score is haunting and harrowing.

266,casejaddy,Captivating but flawed,7,24 November 2018,"In Hostiles, a grizzled Army captain is reluctantly tasked with escorting his former Native American enemies to their new home. Bale shines in the lead role, portraying the veteran Army captain with nuanced pain and internal conflict. The film's dialogue, much like its western setting, is sparse but captivating. The white characters are well written and I found myself genuinely interested in what became of them. My only criticism is the film's use of Native Americans more as a plot device than actual characters. It felt like they existed solely as plot devices for the white people to learn and grow from. At its heart, the film is about acceptance through understanding, making the shallowness of the Native characters that much more disappointing. Despite the missteps, Hostiles is a thoughtful and entertaining western. I would call it a must-watch for fans of the genre and worth seeing for everyone else.",Hostiles

A big shoutout to director, Scott Cooper!

This guy is the ace in any directors sleeve who wants to make a memerable movie. And 10 min of applause for Rosamund Pike! She matched Christian Bale's huge presence and skills in a humbling way. (Such a natural beauty that is hard to find in the age of fillers ;) ).

268,inyz,A bit long but solid otherwise,7,30 April 2018,"Contemplative would be the kind way to put it, but I found that the ryhtm was a bit dysfunctional and I was somewhat bored at moments. The story progresses as slowly as those horses and has an uneven structure, wandering around random plot elements here and there. This is a shame because as expected Scott Cooper delivers very strong directing and character developement. Captain Blocker's morale's journey has an epic and touching feel to it, supported by a typical yet again sublime Christian Bale performance. Scenes of fight (gunfights, mostly) are merciless and no Hollywood good manners are here to save any character; the opening scene escalates damn quickly and sets the tone straight on this matter. This doesn't prevent Cooper from offering more subtle moments, ranging from sharp directing hints showing what a character has in mind to scenes of un-shown violence with a lot of tension to them.If you like meditative westerns and are ready to take a walk in the vast landscapes of XIXth century America, then go aboard and let a great soundtrack and gorgeous visuals, both classical in their style, accompany you on the journey.",Hostiles

This movie sacrifices honesty for political correctness and kills anything approaching authenticity. Lots of dead people and grave digging duty but since we don't care about the characters it is pointless carnage; I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the pointless carnage. Pointless carnage throughout. Forced and cliched, with underdeveloped characters and illogical progressions, this movie never overcomes the PC baggage that ties it down. Minus two stars because of the PC, minus two more because it is depressing, minus one because it is slow, minus one because it had potential but never lived up to it and minus one because some fine actors weren't given a chance to shine in such a dimwitted cinematic vehicle.

Too much useless dialog and repeatingly reinforcing certain character traits. Captain Blocker hates Indians; OK we get it. Move on. Get to the journey...but when they do it's more of the same. Long, tedious conversations, furrowing eyebrows and very little action. Along with this is the added mess that there are no real villains. Then comes the pointless love affair with the crazy woman carrying the dead baby and uncomfortable feelings watching him wait on her hand and foot along the trail, kissing her big white booty... while the Indian children are treated like unwanted baggage. 
 I know. I'm missing the point. It's supposed to be about how his character develops and evolves over time and he feels kind of bad about massacring Native Americans for 30 years before he finally gets a conscience. We even get to witness his army buddy basically commit suicide over his guilt about the Army genocide at Wounded Knee.

The story was excellent and I liked all of the actors, especially Christian Bale, who did an amazing job of converting from loathsome Indian fighter to compassionate native friend. The only scene which really pissed me off, was when Rosalee's husband tells her to take the children and run into the trees to hide. But instead, Rosalee stops half-way to the trees to turn and watch her husband being killed by the attacking Comanche warriors. She is standing on a hillside in broad daylight with 3 small children, mesmerized by her husbands death, and she stands there until the Indians see her and proceed to chase her down and kill all 3 children. I found myself screaming at my TV for her to RUN. But I suppose it makes for a more exciting movie if the woman stands frozen on a hillside, rather than running to safety. I was appalled that any Mother would risk her children's lives to watch her husband die. The movie shows both sides of the native persona, the evil Comanches and the kinder, gentler Chief and his family. Overall it's a pretty good movie.",Hostiles
275,cpowchuk,"Great movie, a bit one side but still worth watching",9,4 October 2018,"I thought the movie was excellent, at bit one sided, showing the brutal attack on the farm house, but in the balance some good-hearted Indians who help the Captain finish his assignment. The only thing that stands out as negative, is the scene where Rosalee is told by her husband to take their 3 children and run to the trees. I watched this scene and found myself screaming at the TV ""RUN, you idiot RUN!"" I DO NOT understand why the writers would do that, it happens in every single movie I've ever watched. With imminent danger fast approaching, people just stand around looking???
Rosalee takes her three children and starts up a hill behind her farm house, half way up she stops and turns to watch as her husband is killed by the attacking Indians. She stands there watching, even though there is absolutely nothing she can do to save him. She stands there long enough for the Indians to notice her and they attack, all three children are killed including a small baby. That scene just infuriated me, Rosalee cannot help her husband, but she could have saved all of her children. Instead she STOPS to watch the killing of her husband and thereby her 3 kids are also killed??? 
I have many pet peeves about movies, and the way they are written, directed and presented to the audience. But one of my biggest peeves is when Imminent danger is coming straight toward the hero(s) people just stand around watching instead of hauling ass away from danger. It ruins the movie for me, just my opinion.",Hostiles

He's the one who is put in charge of escorting a Cheyenne chief, played by West Study to their reservation in Montana. Well I bet you already know how is going to end, don't you? Beautiful landscapes when we can see them. The night scenes are irritatingly dark and they are many. The plight of Rosamund Pike's character - who loses her entire family in a harrowing opening scene - kept me going. She is strong and powerful but Christian Bale gives a performance that is just that, a performance. I like him as an actor when he's good. Brilliant in The Fighter, terrific in American Psycho but embarrassing in Exodus: Gods And King as Moses. Here I needed to believe in those flashes of empathy he seems to insinuate but I didn't. I was too aware of him, the actor. I don't know if I can I explain it but if you look at him walk away at the end of the movie, you'll know exactly what I mean.

278,ecto-3,Nuanced Exploration of Psychological Tensions and Subtleties,9,18 January 2018,"I was intensely moved by this film, which I viewed during a preview screening in San Diego. The composition of the scenes, dark exposures, extreme close-ups, surreal techniques of distortions of focus and viewpoints, saturated and washed out colors, superb acting, and moralistic conflicts between the angels and demons within the humanity that haunts so many, left me transfixed and absorbed by this highly charged and complex production.I was also aware that this may not appeal to mass audiences who expect plot and action to move at a faster pace, with fewer complexities and inward, sometimes awkward analysis.In its simplest form, this is a road trip set on the margins of the 19th Century, when the West was almost tamed, by men hardened by the brutalities of the Civil War, and the slaughter of innocents.It is also a story of honor, of rugged individualism, and a struggle with tribal and racial prejudices that has a very contemporary resonance.I noticed that some were leaving in mid-screening, but most of the preview audience remained until the end, and a good number applauded with conviction.I was intrigued by the lush cinematography, the Kodachrome appearance of some scenes, the extremes of violence and brutality, and the morality lessons of wiping out a race of Native Americans who were here first, but needed to make room and be displaced, out of convenience and greed, because it could be done, regardless of the injustice or inhumanity.Those same prejudices also have a contemporary ring to them, reflecting current attitudes towards immigrants, those of darker skins, and ""the others"" among us.I was reminded of such literary works transformed into screenplays as Heart of Darkness, The Red Badge of Courage, High Noon, The Magnificent Seven, and Seven Samurai, along with directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Antoine Fuqua, John Ford, and John Huston.For those who can endure the graphic violence, scenes with mumbled dialogue, and tormented characters, and can make the effort to go beyond that, this can be a very rewarding film experience.",Hostiles

I could find no reason why the main Character could suddenly forgive the Native American he was taking to his homeland. There were not enough fundemental chances in the script for him to suddenly begin to be this forgiving ""Christian"" soul, after he had murdered so many others.
Plus the craziness of the predicament of the crazy woman, who was tearing at the earth and contemplating suicide at the start; was then kidnapped and raped (offscreen) and who then suddenly became a well dressed Mary Poppins type figure by the final credits. Was there really meant to be final hint of romance between the two main characters, with the adoption of a bereaved native American child thrown in. (Unbelievable romcom!)

Goddam, it's the 21st century, and we STILL have to watch a murdering WHITE MAN's redemption story as a way to address the genocide of two whole continents of native peoples?! The film's pretence of empathising with the natives is totally undermined by giving the great actors who play the natives almost no dialogue, and their characters no development at all, while all the plodding screen time is taken up dwelling silently on the inner sufferings of the two main white characters. This is a disgrace and a horror, and a total FAIL on the most important scale of all: the message of this tale. The director didn't seem to know WHAT he was saying: the subtitle seems to imply that we are all hostile? Is he kidding me? He is equating the state-sponsored slaughter and rounding up of the native populations after stealing their lands, with the violence that the natives committed against the white people in desperate self defence? No wonder the supposed awakening of the white main character, who is just about to retire from a rip-roaring career of state-sponsored mass murdering of natives (which he calls ""the good days"") is impossible to understand. Is he supposed to be the ""hero"" of this story? I'm confused because the write himself was clearly confused. Even an actor the likes of Christian Bale couldn't convince me there was a believable character here. It does make me think less of him, that he took on this role at all. The movie did remind me of the horror of this genocide, I must give it credit for that; but it did no justice to it at all. Instead, you get the annoying feeling of the writer/director congratulating himself for being all P.C. while appropriating the suffering of a people he clearly has no interest in understanding at all. What little progress we have made since 1892!I'm really pissed off that I was tricked into watching this movie to the end, because at first I thought he was kidding, and I kept waiting for the twist that would reveal the irony. I just couldn't believe that in this day and age, someone would still make a movie like this in all seriousness. Were Wes Studi and the other native actors likewise tricked into participating? Or is this the only work they can get? If the latter, it's another sad truth that shows how far we still have to go.The story of the genocide of the native peoples of the new world has yet to be properly told in a film. I hope some day someone will do that. I don't think that someone should be another white dude.",Hostiles

I can however give an unbiased (not privileged) review.As expected from Bale, stoic performance of a man in a time and place he'd rather not be, with burdens he would rather not have, his friends and fellow soldiers dying and his own personal crimes (work..) haunt him as they would.I felt the film despite some critics 'arty' reviews does portray that during this time, bad things were done to good people on both sides, always justified. But those who committed these crimes were the same as you and I, in circumstances they have not chosen, a time when choice was not an option. One takes from the film that choices were not as today, survival was the only desire, and conflict was ever present whichever 'side' you were on.The cast, cinematography, story and especially the score are all fantastic.

Seriously, were they striving for ""Best ASMR"" western genre? Then when there was some actual audible dialog, or God forbid, gun fire, I had to scramble to turn down the volume to avoid breaking my own eardrums and being reported to the county noise abatement enforcement by neighbors three blocks away. I find this style of audio minimalism distracting if not downright infuriating.

This particular iteration is made unique in that the main character and two of the secondaries have recently experienced or are soon to experience very significant changes in their lives. The risky journey affords a compelling backdrop upon which director Scott Cooper crafts an engrossing, beautifully-filmed motion picture.I recommend HOSTILES highly.",Hostiles

However, the plot suffered from some unbelievable elements that spoiled the pictureObviously, the scriptwriter imposed 21st Century values and hindsight on a supposedly 19th Century story. More specifically, the heroine's decision, soon after trauma that supposedly left her totally dysfunctional, to leave a fort's safety at risk of more of the horrors she'd already seen, completely dashed the suspension of disbelief so necessary to fiction. The final insult was the closing scene, so hackneyed and predictable that it may have been taken from some western from the 1950s.This could have been a classic, but the cook threw in too much that didn't belong and spoiled the broth.

I do have one gripe with one scene that kinda confuses me but its not huge. In a scene maybe 30 minutes in they are attacked by another tribe and they give a rifle to the chief that they are escorting and right off the bat they all trust the natives they are escorting even though they did not up to that point.

Filmmaker Scott Cooper, whose works on period films such as Black Mass, returns again this time to the further reaches of the western landscape with Christian Bale (Out of the Furnace) along with other seasoned stars, Rosamund Pike (The World's End) and Wes Studi (The Last of the Mohicans) to 1892, where the unwilling, Army Captain Joseph J. Blocker (Bale) agrees to escort Cheyenne Chief Yellow Hawk (Studi) and his family along a treacherous route throughout the vast territories.Highlight!
The events leading up to the alignment of central characters, Blocker, Yellow Hawk, and Rosalie Quaid, plays a mindful importance of what comes to set up the travelers with an exploration of resemblance which functions quite well to provide an effective outcome. Remarkable?
It's noteworthy how the film manages well to bring in and out minor characters in service of a few narrative twists and turns here and there and yet at the same time, might be what faults it for its slow pacing throughout most of its entirety. Still, it should not detract from how well the collective story in Hostile pieces together the truth in different people who are not so different.

Your feelings toward him change when he comes upon the remnants of an Indian raid on settlers where a white woman is the only one left alive but in shock holding her dead child. He is extremely sympathetic to her and does everything he can to comfort her even granting her hysterical requests. He switches gears so completely, yet so believably it's something to see. He is a man of duty, and his duty toward hostiles is to eliminate the threat, his duty to his men is to lead them, his duty to the grieving mother is to comfort and protect her. His expression barely changes but his intentions are always clear. He is a child actor who takes his work seriously and can play a multitude of characters and in Hostiles you come to respect, even like this person who has a moral compass that never waivers. If you want to understand who he is, read the poem ""Character of The Happy Warrior"" by William Wordsworth. Bales character, Capt. Joseph Blocker is the incarnation of ""The Happy Warrior"". The movie takes place in 1892 and the poem was published in 1807 so perhaps Capt. Blocker had read it? The supporting cast is also outstanding and I believe there probably were men like him at that time. It is far better than the propaganda westerns of the past and paints a much more accurate picture albeit without showing the true suffering the whites inflicted during the genocide on the Americas. Bales performance is outstanding! People still talk of Marlon Brando as the best actor ever. I believe Christian Bales' body of work is unsurpassed by any actor.",Hostiles

To me Hostiles felt like a squandered opportunity which needed to pick one plot line and fully explore it, instead they decided to try and shoe horn in half a dozen sadly underdeveloped B plots which all get resolved too easily; this seems to have been done in the pursuit of deeper themes that all ended up feeling incredibly shallow, a good example of this is Christian Bales hatred for 'the savages' which he manages to get over extremely quickly, he goes from ""keep them in chains and if they move shoot them"" to ""quick give them guns"" in a matter of minutes.In the end I was left conflicted: on one hand I was left feeling deflated by the underwhelming story, on the otherhand I was impressed that the director managed to wring so much film out of so little substance.",Hostiles

So other then the sophomoric writing, the non-acting, and the hokey sets, this movie is at least boring. But that would be an insult to boredom. Lame at every level. Just rent ""Once upon in the time in the West"" for a real western, that's at least sorta close to reality.",Hostiles
339,hancocktom41,Suprisingly good despite people saying it was politically motivated.,8,25 April 2018,"I would have said the same thing that it was bad merely because they put in a female role and an african american role but it, in fact seemed very naturalistic. Yes the african american didn't seem naturalistic in regards to the time period but all the characters were very on point. There were no actions where they tried to add comedic relief or super popular actors shoving the face through the tv just to be there as we see in so many of our garbage reboot movies today. The woman was not overpowered but was in fact on par to an average biological woman's bodytype around the time. My intentional thought on the end was that the murder of the man was quite brutal and overkill to stress some political point but then after I thought back over the prior actions of the characters I reconsidered. The woman in the movie expressed throughout a large chunk shock and disbelief that people killed her family and even by the end seemed to still be in shock by everything that happened. That made me think back to all the deaths that happened in the group that the main leader was in and I thought if they are following the naturalistic tendency to be in shock, they probably are going to show other natural emotions such as the buildup of anger from things that may even be unrelated. Aside from all the controversey the way it was filmed was nothing to be praised or frowned upon and was quite normal and the soundtrack was not overpowering and subtle when necessary. I found the soundtrack to be my favorite thing as it didn't feel like one of those overblown marvel movies with the unnecessary blaring trumpets. The overall story was beautiful as well as deep and the buildup was great. The quote about death the main character and the woman talked about was probably one of the most impactful parts, subjectively speaking at least. 
 One of my favorite parts was the predictability of the movie. as big moments that were just around the corner didn't just pop up out of nowhere coincidentally right after someone, say, talks. In all I didn't give it a 10 as its messages were not something that I have not already heard and the architecture seemed questionable in its regards to accuracy to the late 1800s. I have not researched enough to say it was on par or not but despite my ignorance, I feel as if the buildings looked too new and propped up to properly proclaim accuracy. In all though, I would say it is up there with my favorites and I look forward to rewatching to see if there is anything I did not catch the first time.",Hostiles

It hits all over the emotional spectrum....anger, sadness, pain, happiness...all of it. For the most part, the movie is very heavy in terms of its emotional weight, similar to Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven."" It is refreshing to see something original and new come out of Hollywood, especially in the Western genre. In my opinion, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances (Oscar worthy)....and he has a lot of them. This film is loaded with talented actors and actresses and while the pace is somewhat slow at times, it makes up for it with the dramatic and tense scenes. I was constantly on edge wondering what is going to happen next. I will add that I watched this movie on BluRay, but will be purchasing the 4K version for my home theater.

The trailer made it look like a boring film on the history of Native Americans and the culture clash of that era, which in affect it is, but so much more as well. This film is astonishingly good in every way. The character development is superb and the acting by both famous and new actors is top class. Extra credit to Christian Bale for his performance. He deserves recognition of his own. This film is moving and eye opening. There were times that it brought me to tears, but in the end, a happy ending makes this film all the while worth watching. I want to talk more about the character development and the superb storytelling but then this review won't be spoiler free, so I'll refrain from doing so. I just really want to emphasize that this film is an absolute masterpiece. If you enjoyed 'The Revenant(2015)' you'll definitely enjoy this film. Personally, I think this was even better than the latter. This film is packed full of action and excitement as well as heartfelt emotional scenes that really compliment this film in it's entirety.

The actors did well to keep viewers engaged, especially Bale. Cinematography was great, as are most mountain-based movies nowadays. Besides certain historical inaccuracies about train availability and the absurdity of the Army keeping a tag-along woman with them for the duration of the journey, the most offensive part to me was the story line that had the Army Captain eventually comes to respect the Chief and essentially forgives him. That would have NEVER happened. This is simple political correctness that is hogwash. Reality is they probably would have killed the Chief and his family 5 miles out of town. There is no way warriors like that would have ever come to see eye-to-eye about anything. This coming together was predictable early on in the movie and made for some very painful scenes to watch just knowing how it was evolving.

346,stuey-80049,Not a film for the closed minded pedant,10,4 May 2018,"I'm compelled to write this after reading some of the attacks on this movie because it dares to differ from the guns blazing, sharp shooting kill-fests that apparently are on the only films that can be called a 'western'. Are the locations and dates all historically correct? No. Is this the first film to do that for the sake of the story arc? Of course it isn't, getvover it. Does this movie ram home a certain message?Yes. But maybe it's a message that's worth it and if it made me give thought to the plight of an entire race of people that is so often glossed over, then it worked. There were moments when I knew what was coming but we are all so savvy and movie saturated these days that it's hardly a crime. Now that I've finished railing against the haters (yes we can all have an opinion but such vitriol against a film that dares to step away from the norm is not healthy), it is wonderfully filmed and scripted. There are no words wasted but they are all delivered with intensity. All of the cast deliver but I think Christian Bale (not his biggest fan by the way, blame Batman) delivers a masterclass. He gradually lets us in deeper and deeper into his character, sometimes with his words, sometimes with his eyes or his attempt to master his emotions. Absolutely excellent. The pacing of the movie was perfect, it's ok to wallow in glorious scenery sometimes. And it really is glorious. I can't recommend this film highly enough if you are in the mood for a captivating character study that will make you think and just might make you uncomfortable at times. If you like Dances with Wolves you will like this. If you want 90 minutes of quick draws and gun fights, watch Young Guns (which I also think is good movie, not hating)",Hostiles

On the surface there are a lot of things to like; Both Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike give great performances and the acting overall really stands out, the landscape cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the music great, and the portrayal of life on the American outer frontier was interesting enough to keep me engaged (almost) throughout the movie.
 
But unfortunately the story falls kinda flat somewhere during the second act and it never quite picks up again. As a result the movie as a whole just ends up feeling a bit drab, dour, and kinda pointless.
I really didn't mind the strong anti-manifest destiny message behind the film, it's a story that deserves to be told IMO, but that message is much better served as an element of the overall plot, not the main driving force behind it. A good Western should have at least a little sense of ""adventure"", Hostiles is severely lacking in that department. So not bad, but probably should've been a whole lot better.",Hostiles

The early West was a brutal frontier. And this movie shows that.  Wes Studi as always, gives a very good performance.This is the first movie that I have seen Rosamund Pike in. She gives a very compelling performance, especially after what happens to her in the in the opening scene. The supporting cast is first rate as well.

We hurt others and we hurt ourselves, so badly that it becomes difficult for us to live a life worth living.The dignity in the scenes where the characters express their true, their human feelings about what has occurred was very touching.The story of what was done to the North American original natives,needs telling in much more length and detail, and it may teach everyone important things. It is a story that has happened in many so called 'civilised' nations. It is peculiar then that it should be so difficult for humans to understand that death, suffering, violence, pain, indignity leads to absolutely nothing, and worse than nothing.

355,glegotravel,Geronimo: An American Legend meets The Homesman,7,8 April 2018,"That's basically the script of the movie Hostiles, given some twists and turns.
Now, for me, a Western movie doesn't necessarily have to be (historically) accurate and making sense.
After all it's a study of evil and good and how they relate, with the grandeur of nature in the background.
For this, it's quite a good movie. The cinematography and acting are good. The score excellent. It's a movie worth seeing. Unless you are into B-level action-packed entertainment, following the pace of the information society with gallons of popcorn and coke as fuel.
Yes the film can be perceived as slow and boring. But it isn't if you have a different perspective. For me it was not slow at all, It could have been expanded here and there (see further). There are no horses that turn out to be aliens and the train doesn't turn into a transformer. 
There are no real heroes in this movie, or at least that's the (starting) premise. It tries to portray humans. What a relief. But because all of that it won't be the box office success it deserves to be.
There is still some irritating political correctness in the movie. The good ""grateful"" black is superfluous. Still the Indians (sorry for using the historical term) are not portrayed as the cuddly new-age creatures of the 90's and neither are they (all) viciously mad bullet-fodder stuntmen as in the 50's.
We see that evil is everywhere as there is also room for goodness and redemption. The story tells us the line between being a war hero and a war criminal can be very thin, if not artificial and hypocritical. We are all hostiles, as the author explains. It's a message that is needed in this polarizing world.
However, I think it could have been a much better picture, like a 9 or 10, if the personalities of the ""Indians"" had been further developed and their acting role increased. I'm sure Wes, Adam and Q'orianka are more than able to do that, seeing their repertoire. And as even the embodiment of white evil, Sgt. Charles Wills, gets his lines of defense, the ""evil"" Comanche deserve that too. A few lines would have made the difference. Not the ""They are snakes"" of Wes Studi or the ""They are driven from their land"" from the lady in the village. For instance, in ""The last of the Mohicans"" Wes Studi explains why Magua is so vengeful and we can understand him as a person, if not sympathize. 
In this we see, as in the final scene where the 3 adult Indians easily die in the shootout but the - by then turned heroes - whites walk away (with the ""Arnold""-like kid), that we are moving a little bit backwards to the 50's again. Or is it simply that marketing profiling sees a bigger market in the majority ethnic groups (White and Black) in the main market (USA) to identify ourselves with than the smaller minorities (like Natives or Asian Americans)?",Hostiles

But this movie also depicts forgiveness, of releasing old hatreds. Coming to forgiveness, respect, and even a sort of kinship if not friendship. An era engulfed in change never before seen of imagined.This is also the tail of men who have seen too much war, too much death and violence. The struggles that those who have lived war can only truly understand and appreciate. An eternal question of why some can cope and live with the horrors they have experienced and participated in while others cannot.

358,soorajvns,My Beef with Director Scott cooper,8,12 April 2018,"This is a movie by Scott Cooper and you know what that means.Its gonna be mediocre at best. His movies involves strong men crying or breaking down or showing their vulnerable side. Every director with an ambition will try to create a stamp for himself in terms of his signature direction. Scott cooper has an ambition but his talent isn't enough to meet his goal. He is trying to turn genre's on their heads by exposing their protagonists for who they are. A country singer/celebrity as a sad soul, an all american blue collar worker as a man stuck in circle of life,a gangster as a low dwelling vampire and a western hero as a man effected by changing time but the problem is the script of his movies are just average and he isn't talented enough to elevate the material...he lucked out with crazy heart being the ""its time"" moment for Jeff bridges to win Oscar..so it was hard to point out whether Jeff bridges overdue got him Oscar or Scott coopers direction..and he was able to get christian bale and johnny Depp for his next projects..what happens when you get actors of that caliber is that you get big budgets for your movies and high quality cast and technicians..that in of itself elevates the material to some extent but for a movie to be truly Oscar caliber and great, you need the director to have that magical touch...the camera work..the skill of making audience feel something by the visuals and tension and suspense..if every movie made by a director is being praised as having great performances that compensate for story and weak narrative then there is something wrong with the director.Either he cant elevate the material or he isn't talented enough to come up with that one script he wrote that would get his foot through the door into the elite club or that one mediocre collaborator he would work with to create something magnificent. If its none of those things then the director is getting whatever exposure only because of his stars aka bale,Depp or bridges..swap them with a low talented actor and he gets no exposure or budget...so all those awards panels and deep talks about his inspirations are just there because of the stars of the movie and not because of the quality of the movie or direction.SO MY ADVICE to scott cooper is to either relegate yourself to genre making and not crave that oscar glory or take 5 years off and write a magnificent script that will be approved by a studio so you get the distribution..make ma movie that will be released by a studio based on the quality of the script and not the star power of the leads.",Hostiles

As to be Scott Cooper and Christian Bale's second collaboration together, this violent Western film does contain heart. Set back in 1892, Captain Joseph J. Blocker (Christian Bale) has participated in the Indian Wars. He is known as a brutal man and a leader. When he is assigned to escort a dying Cheyenne War chief named Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi), he knows he will be purposely heading out on a risky mission internally and externally. During the trip, they come across Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike) who witnessed her family's murder by Comanches. Afterwards, everyone sets out to Montana with a few grisly twists and turns.Hostiles is actually a great Western film. You have, in which I noticed first, direct characterization. Every character in this film is shown as their own self while caring for the others. On the plus side of that, you have got your actors and actresses who displayed their characters thoroughly. You have also got your great direction by Scott Cooper. The whole story was put as an intense picture with a couple of ""What is going to happen?"" moments. I mean we've also witnessed those in Movies. It's pretty thought-provoking, but we know that gunfights and Indians are very common in this Western film. Cooper has displayed it all well. Finally, I also noticed that the cinematography was pretty moving as well. In Western films, we have always got our landscape shots and close-ups on shoot-outs. It's pretty interesting and entertaining at the same time. Anyways, I give credit to the acting for this film, the direction, and the cinematography. Those features were the things that I noticed the most specifically in this film. The score was great too with every scene as well!Hostiles had a lot of heart into it alongside of the brutal scenes. There is a very important message of teamwork, loyalty, and even of looking deeper inside a person to see the real goodness of them.

I knew the movie would be about an anti-Native American soldier who'd eventually come to see the futility of such hatred and violence... and I waited for that to develop. Yet nothing ever did develop. The character bonds that we as an audience would have expected from a story like this were never delved into. What made Bale's character make a complete 180? What about Pike's character (and the plot contrivance of having her continue with the entourage? Was anything achieved by that? When the prisoner character was introduced I thought that finally the movie would go into the theme of redemption and seeing oneself within the Other. But then he just ends dying quickly after his introduction... His character seemed to have been made to contrast Bale's increasing humanity towards the Cheyenne family he was escorting. What with all the violence, I felt very little for many of the characters in this film - especially Bale's character. I can buy someone filled with such discriminatory hatred realizing the error in that type of thinking and behaving. But I didn't buy Bale's character's arc.Other things to considerThe Black soldier's character left very much to be desired. I think there was a missed opportunity, what with his (at least to me) symbolic presence in the film. What was the point of the whole fur trapper-rape sequence? What was learned by that? Sure it's another lesson for Bale's character about life's senseless violence but... it just felt random and gratuitous. The film doesn't bother to linger on how this affected Pike's character and Elk Women.Why have Pike's character (seemingly) adopt the remaining Cheyenne boy?

The brutality of the wild-west was captured on-screen, as was its consequences on the consciousness of its survivors. Life was short, and brutal in the time and place of the setting for the story. The relationship of the Captain to his soldiers, and in particular his friendship with an African American soldier demonstrate he was an honorable leader. His caring and respectful treatment of a widow demonstrate his chivalry. His internal struggle for his moral compass, is turned in-side out for the audience to witness. The only question that remains for me is whether it is possible that a Captain, a Chief and so many soldiers could have been so self-aware that something was awry.

379,gailcaldwell,Updated Western! Outstanding!!,9,4 July 2018,"I was shocked at how good this turned out to be. I mean we figured this was going to be a pretty good ""era"" movie , old western as it were that Christian Bale does so well, but this truly turned out to be one of the best that he has done in awhile . And Rosamund Pike (from Gone Girl) was OUTSTANDING in this. Her partrayal of a wife and mother whose entire family is slaughtered by a band of rogue Cheyenne Indians is chilling. Her performance throughout is just impressive.
It is a moderately paced western that keeps the story steady and the characters in check so you aren't lost which is a VERY welcome trait in my book because so many lately are doing the opposite. Trying to add too many characters to the story and in the process you lose track of the story line. THIS DOES NOT DO THAT. 
Bale keeps things moving and you know where your story is headed at all times.
Wes Studi as the Indian Chief is amazing. He has played this role in many other movies and he does it with mastery. Adam Beach is the same. He doesn't say much but doesn't have to, he is excellent in his roll as supporting.The ending is a little surprising and yet sad and then finally good.

Great acting, great music, great actors, great great pictures.What I also like, is the ambivalence shown between badass natives and badass Europeans and the fact which here is clearly shown, that humans CAN respect each other regardless. ""I had a friend... when you die, some of me dies with you...""I put this in a line with Open Range or Broken Trail.
Even ""The last Mohican"" does not compete, which brings me to
Wes Study, whom I especially remember from his role as Magua.
Here his role heals the bad guy demeanor and makes him wise and kind.
""Your soul is in me..."" nearly not bearable.Chris Bale constantly reminds me of the act of Col. Chamberlain in Gettysburg, played by Jeff Daniels, the same intensity and deepness.
A greatly underrated movie.

My 4 star rating goes to the surprisingly good acting (I'm a Bale fan) and the seldom seen action scenes. The beginning is heart wrenching and the ending is heart warming. That's honestly about it.

Any honest person knows that these narratives are laughably two-dimensional, and a far cry from the reality of complex, breathing human beings, flawed as we all are. The film does a great job of unpacking the serious problems and inner-conflicts that all humans face, and properly demonstrates the fact that all races have villains capable of despicable things, even at the expense of each other. It's also a very interesting storyline, which, of course helps.

I watched on a US return flight where I usually pick an ""easy watch"", and with Hostiles I expected a mix of Outlaw Josey Wales, with a bit of Two Mules for Sister Sarah, and a heavy helping of macho Americanism... How wrong I was.. 
Centred around Chief Yellow Hawk and Captain Joseph Baker, it tells the story of how murderous hatred can turn to a realisation of the terrible things a person has done, and my thoughts went to what we now call PTSD.. The opening scenes are shocking and brutal, and the movie unfolds into a stark review of how white settlers and native Americans battled over tribal lands and succumbed to persecution, but without any of the John Wayne era cowboys and indians rubbish.I found myself quickly immersed in this harrowing story and connected very well to the main characters. At the films climax I found myself to be emotionally tested at the way the story closes, and I wanted to know more about what came next, I wanted to see more about the story before this film, to know more about the characters.This was one of the most powerful films I have seen in a long time, and I cant wait to watch it again on a larger format screen. this is NOT a ""cowboys and indians"" film, and I highly recommend it.

400,o-jaroudi,Good show all in all,8,24 August 2018,"Hostiles, in its essence, can be viewed as a social experiment; foes sharing a common path, meeting common dangers, and learning with time what it means to respect, and even forgive.
Dir. Scott Cooper made it crystal clear that a 'happily ever after' does not exist in such a setting, and should not for that matter. He shows us what a harsh reality the west really was, which makes Hostiles a movie of a rare caliber, and by rare I mean that (from my own experience) people might underrate the whole project due to it not complying with the clichè standards of a western, such as happy endings. After seeing the extent of havoc caused by pure hatred and savagery of men, one is left too devastated to rejoice. Even the characters themselves are left broken in spirit, only meaning to survive.
Despite having a longer-than-usual runtime, I'd say it was time well spent;the time spent on every scene was well distributed with respect to the emotions that were invested in that scene; which is what matters in a movie based mainly on these emotions. A display which I can't imagine any other cast more adequate for than Bale and Pike. They filled the shoes of their characters with great ability and grace, sharing with us a very rich and sincere spectrum of emotions. Not a scene went by were I wasn't feeling the full emotional intensity of the characters on screen.",Hostiles
401,fhelisch,"A Somber Meditation on Violence, Trauma, and Forgiveness",8,30 January 2018,"""Hostiles"" is a slow moving and somber treatment of some of the aspects of the American Indian Wars, which were marked by brutal violence by both the native Americans and the US military.
The film is set in the 1890's, when these Native Americans had been largely subdued and their survivors confined in remote reservations and in prisons. Veteran Indian fighter, Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) is ordered against his will to escort his dying, old, nemesis, Chief Yellow Hawk, from confinement in New Mexico to his ancestral burial grounds in Montana. To do the job he is joined by a few handpicked troops. Yes, this is a road movie.
Along the way, they pick up Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike), whose family has just been murdered by a marauding Blackfeet war party. This is graphically shown in the opening scene. She is in a state of shock and the film dwells for some time to show her grief and despair.
As the little trek makes its way towards Montana, it encounters an attack by the Blackfeet war party, a kidnapping and rape of the women in the group by white fur trappers, a murderous soldier on his way to be hanged, and a deadly encounter with a white landowner who refuses to have Chief Yellow Hawk's body buried on his land. 
In the course of sharing the journey, Blocker and the Indian chief forgive each other for the hurt and terror they caused each other's people. Rosalie, likewise, evolves from shocked terror at the sight of native Americans to compassion and forgiveness.
While the evolution of the old Indian butcher and the just traumatized Rosalie from Indian haters to compassionate forgivers is a stretch, it does not feel overly forced in the film, as the mutual forgiveness slowly evolves through small gestures and the shared dangers of the journey. 
This film is much about deadly violence and its effects. One of them is that in the end only Blocker, Rosalie, and Little Bear, the old chief's young grandson survive the journey. 
The film is a series of encounters interspersed with scenes of the group making their way through a slowly changing landscape to their destination. The nature scenes do not have the majestic magnetism of, say, The Revanant, where they take on a mystical life of their own. Rather nature is just backdrop, somehow tainted by the violence that unfolds in it.
There are some powerful, meditative shots of people in groups, or alone, but the film lacks visual power, the two fort towns little more than cobbled together sets that could have come from a Bonanza episode, the nature scenes powerless and almost ugly.
There is a bit of a forced political correctness about the film. Is development of mutual respect and even love between bitter, mortal, enemies the probable story between Blocker and Yellow Hawk? Perhaps, now that the war and the killing are largely over. Also, the presence of an Afro-American soldier in the group who is the trusted subordinate of the Captain, without there being even a hint of racism, strikes me as unhistorical. The Revanant, where human relations are rife with racial animosity, does a better job in portraying American history.
Christian Bale does a fine in portraying a man marked by guilt, stress, depression, and rage because of a life lived in violence, even if that is the job description, and the many losses of friends he had to bear. He has that perpetual, tough, glum expression on his face that you often see in period photos of white males. A hard life to be sure. 
Rosamund Pike is equally effective in portraying a deeply traumatized woman, even if her evolution to comforter and love interest of the Captain is a bit swift.
I found the characters of the Native Americans underdeveloped. Once again, they have the flavor of extras, and there is not much interest in investigating what lurks beneath their stoic, macho, warrior presentation. The female Native Americans are almost completely ignored.
A hard look at the American past that makes for contemplation, as we share the pain of these souls over acts of unspeakable violence, injustice, and grief and trauma, and their struggle to survive by killing. The reconciliation of the enemies is moving. While not exactly distracting entertainment, this uncomfortable film is food for thought and soul.",Hostiles

410,bushilomaria,two-faced American soul,5,26 January 2018,"A GOOD movie night is what I call watching a movie that you didn't really want to watch. It's heavy, it's historical, it's drama and it leaves you thinking. So a GOOD movie night is not for mind numbing blockbusters or family comedies (though either one of those can be a good high quality movie). Going to the cinema last night I was prepared for a GOOD movie night. Choice fell onto the ""Hostiles"". Drama, based in 1890s. Vaguely based on real historical facts. On the menu: cultural differences, ethnic racism, deaths, cruelty, hatred. Spiced with lots of blood, screams and grief (unreasonably escalated and overplayed as turned out later). Main aspect: natives VS whitemen. Main actors: Bale and Pike. Sounds like a great choice for a heavy, soul drenching movie with incredible actors on stage. DISAPPOINTMENT. Big fat disappointment this movie is. Cinematography: cliché, cliché, cliché. I felt like I have seen this movie before. And if I could attach pictures here I would, to showcase how many scenes in the movie are simple clichés that we have seen everywhere: from Indiana Jones, to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly to even Mulan.
However, I get that some people will say it's CLASSIC. I can't argue that. It's classical to the bone, no inventiveness whatsoever in terms of scenery, camera angles, movements, ets. Actors: Rosamund Pike is a sociopath (and I mean it as a compliment) with her ability to portrait pain so well. With million of emotions on her face changing each other almost every second, she is a diamond of that movie, BUT... I hate to do that, because I truly love her work and find her incredibly talented - but some scenes are overplayed. Same goes for Christian Bale - good acting, apart from really painful moments that are also painful to watch because it's so horribly overplayed. I might just be a different person and experience pain in different way than the director/actors, but when I saw Bale screaming on his knees with his hands to the sky all I could think of is how good this scene will compliment my existing meme collection. What was he doing anyways? Burying a gun? That he used later in the movie? I am sure there is a better explanation to this and I just missed it with a loud popcorn chewing.Story: a cherry on top of my dissatisfaction cake. Apart from not being fully truthful and historically correct, it is also very clearly trying to erase the ""bad guy"" stereotype from the American nation. With this movie every North American who watched it cleaned off the blood from their hands. Because, maybe - maybe, we are not so bad after all? That is exactly what this movie tried to tell us. Admit to your mistakes by stating it at the very beginning: ""The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer. It has never yet melted."" And further on show us how soft, lonesome and emotional Americans are. Clearly, director never believed in the words he quoted. I would have a much better opinion of the movie, if the purpose of it was to show how truly heartless and cruel people can be to one another. But director had to ruin it with tears and heart-kindness. The end is snotty-optimistic with love all around and peace. To further indignant voices screaming about the amount of killed people in the movie - I see it all as colorful confetti that covers up a main idea - we are all good people, we are all human, and we all want to love and be loved. It is a good message to pass into masses, but realism of the statement is 0. Not what I expected to see based on the trailer/plot/reviews. I would recommend this movie for teenagers (I wanted to say children, but I guess it's a bit too bloody) - like a good old Disney movie - where we fight, we make up and live happily ever after.",Hostiles

415,ehonsey33,Deliver more than expected,9,12 October 2019,"The premise is simple: old soldier receives final orders to escort his enemy despite his outright defiance. A plot that foreshadows tension culminating in a final battle or an unexpected resolution between bitter foes. However, something that could have easily been mistaken for a story of revenge, or even a subtle apology for the long past injustices against Native Americans, surprisingly turned into a story much deeper than expected. One of past trauma, current loss, and the difficult paths that lie before us despite our resistance.After an opening scene of such intensity, how is one to know what the film has in store? The threat of battle, mental instability, sheer violence? Scott Cooper brought all those elements into this film. Nevertheless, why pull the audience down this strange and violent path? One with a seemingly shallow premise of a wornout captain begrudgingly performing his duty for the political gain of his superiors? At first it seems pointless in a way. Yet the pull of this film is in the slow movement of characters within the solemn, post-war West.Each character must deal with the harrowing events of their past and present lives, reminding us that life can be crueler than we ever imagine. It can twist and turn in directions that desensitize us to the present and leave us feeling as a shell of our former selves. If one is not careful the entire tone of the movie feels cold and barren, but with careful attention and a focus on empathizing with the characters trauma the viewer is gripped by its power. The resolution does not present us with the typical Hollywood ending, but a call for self-reflection in the midst of past suffering inflicted on ourselves. A reminder that we must resolve the past and choose how we move forward despite the spectre of death in plain sight.And to top it off, although this film focuses on the sorrow of the human condition, the stunning landscape surrounding this journey was uplifting. A reminder that nature provides beauty while we inflict harm upon each other.The dialogue could have been less stiff, and resolution of past greivances less reserved, but the film still delivers a captivating view of our forlorn nature.",Hostiles

Redemption, forgiveness, honor, duty, and loyalty are portrayed here in the movie.

You'll feel like the journey took weeks, and you'll feel like the men who died during the journey were the fortunate ones. You may never recover from the suffocating, brutal boredom that you have just endured - but you will have my respect for seeing the journey through to the end and completing the mission.Don't get me wrong - the politics didn't bother me (it was fair and two-sided), and I'm a huge Bale fan and think he's a great actor. Also, the cinematography is beautiful. But, you'll know what I mean after enduring your fifth fireside chat about how good the beans tasted that time down at Old Creek or after watching a soldier nap for 12 minutes while a fly buzzes. around his head.Trust me, you'll see what I mean....don't say you weren't warned.",Hostiles
422,ericgunderson,"Not a ""Guns Blazing"" Western",8,5 September 2018,"Too many people are hung up on the historical inaccuracies of this film and the choice by the filmmakers not to pay more attention to the plight of the Native Americans. But that is not what this film is about - they are just the backdrop and catalyst for the story of a man's transformative journey from a monster to ""redemption"" (in that era). 
Could the filmmakers have chosen other circumstances to tell a similar story? Absolutely! Would it have been just as good or resonate as strongly? Doubtful. Americans understand the lawlessness of the old west from a historical perspective, so the setting rings true for the vehicle of the story - especially at the end when the protagonist is figuratively faced with who he was just weeks before.
Christian Bale's performance anchors this film and I find it hard to see another actor being able to immerse themselves in this character to make the transformation as believable as he does. At the start of the film he is NOT likeable and yet by the end, Bale has managed to imbue him with enough humanity that you do want to see him happy.
Weeks after seeing ""Hostiles,"" the film and this man's journey still linger and resonate. I keep thinking this is like an inverted ""Unforgiven."" In that film, Clint Eastwood's character is drawn back into violence and death and here we are watching a man trying to draw himself out. Ultimately, ""Hostiles"" is telling us that even the worst of us can, and should, have the opportunity for redemption.
I'll be watching this one again soon.",Hostiles

426,njtpt,"A modern ""classic"" western (Spoiler Warning)",9,27 January 2018,"I've have been fan or Westerns my whole life. When I Saw the trailer and read about the info on this one. I couldn't wait. Some of the positive reviews made me even more interested. I am happy to say I wasn't disappointed.I think it is fair to warn you that unlike other westerns the violence depicted here is brutal, sudden, and hard to watch. But then again, so is violence in real life. The violence here, and the reactions of the characters to it are intense and will linger.For me to recap the movie, step by step would ""spoil"" it for you (The spoiler to follow addresses ""Hostiles"" in relation to ""The Searchers""). I'm not giving away anything by saying that the movie is a story of redemption for both Capt Blocker and Yellow Hawk. They are mortal enemies, who by necessity must move beyond their past r to unite against forces that come up against them. Along the way they earn each other's respect and find peace. The movie is also about the recovery of the Rosalie Quaid from a horrible tragedy to bond with people she would never had expected to and find renewal and hope. Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi do tremendous work, as does the whole cast.Other critics have commented the roles of Yellow Hawk and his family are under written. I disagree as I think they convey their thoughts through their actions rather than words. Those actions, especially in the fight scenes, speak volumes.When the story reaches its conclusion, I found the ending the surviving characters well earned. Another review I read mentioned this movie takes some material from probably the greatest western of all ""The Searchers"". Here comes the spoiler (so if you haven't seen the movie yet, stop). In ""The Searchers"", Ethan Edward's journey ends with him bringing his niece home and her family carrying her through the door of their home to their family inside. Ethan is an outsider the whole movie, does not step through the door to join and instead walks away, still an outsider. In ""Hostiles"", whether to step through a door is a decision Capt. Blocker has to make. His decision truly symbolizes the end of his journey of redemption.""Hostiles"" asks a lot of the viewer. But if you stick with it, you will be very happy you did!",Hostiles

Along the way the party encounter wild and dangerous Comanche ""Indians"". The movie is intense and I surmise Bale will be nominated for an Academy Award for this turn. Wes Studi, as always, as the ailing Chief, is marvelous, understated and ever so powerful. Rosamund Pike is superb as a deranged widow who is collected up by Bale's party. Her presence in the story seems like a distraction from the original mission or orders, but it's a movie and we have to have some man/woman tension and whatever then derives from that, of course. The movie sometimes slows down a bit, and lingers, but it always recovers, and overall - see this movie. And the music score is perfect.",Hostiles

I think about mans madness often, but this is a truly extraordinary and perfectly laid out example of how insane and truly self destructive man can be no matter where we come from.This film was perfectly acted and filmed in such a beautiful manner, the score was complimentary not over bearing. I truly felt I was watching man through Gods eyes and felt terrible about the choices everyone made but understood where everyone was coming from. It was watching the world stay beautiful as man played out their ugly and messy lives on some of the most amazing backdrops.This film deserves higher praise than I am able to articulate, I'll just leave it at that.I'm not saying this to elevate myself or demean anyone, I truly mean what I'm saying. If you don't like it or get it, you are blessed with closed eyes and ignorance that could bring happiness in such a cruel world with a cruel past.

437,nwhagnew,Great revisionist western,9,9 January 2019,I really loved this film. It starts with an act of extreme violence then uses the rest of it's time to explore the consequences of such acts. From the immediate grief and despair of the 'broken' Rosamund Pike to the PTSD stricken and melancholic Rory Cochrane the performances really show the effects of the violent environment. Christian Bale is also excellent as the Captain reconsidering the worthiness of his war against the Native Americans. My only complaint would be that the resolutions in the film seem a little over the top for what has been earned. The captain going from entirely hating the Chief to feeling like part of him has died with him and the three survivors living together both seem like big stretches.The cinematography in Hostiles is beutiful throughout. I genuinely don't think the western landscape has been shown more beautifully before.,Hostiles

447,buhic_nadza,It's not about action,8,3 May 2018,"Of course it's going to be a great movie, when Christian Bale's playing the main role, but I should not judge a movie by it's actors. To be honest, I was expecting dynamic action scenes that include fighting scenes, gunshots and violence,but I've saw something much better and something that gave the movie a deeper touch. Many complained that this movie is too slow, but it's not about action. In my view it's about how the characters evolve through the movie, how they get the chance to look their life from another perspective and even though many of them lost a lot during their life's, they get a new opportunity to forgive themselves and their enemies. The movie begins with that man who's filled with hate and was ready to kill himself than to help some Native Americans to get to the North, ended up with someone who saw that life has much more to offer than hate and anger. He let go of all that and decided to seek for forgiveness and even friendship from his once so hated enemy. The best part is, that the enemy was feeling the same, but considering the fact, that the enemy, the Yellow Hawk, came to the same conclusion much earlier. When facing the death, when facing the fact that there's always a chance to see someone for the last time, people get more grateful and they feel enlightened for having everything that's already there, they find the inner wisdom and start living their wasted life. The saddest part here is, that many people, even today, come to that conclusion too late and because of that this movie gives us the opportunity to see this as sooner as possible. In the end, hate and anger are only things that exist in our heads, an unnecessary problem that can cause many other problems and it can be avoided in such an easy way, like a simple handshaking. Watching that beautiful woman who lost her whole family in few minutes was terrifying, but watching her growing in that strong character, who did not take the easy way out, I'm talking about committing suicide, gave me goosebumps. She was strong enough to talk with Yellow Hawk family who reminded her on the killers of her family, she was strong enough to give a little bit of strength to Joseph when he was down after his friend committed suicide by hugging him, she was strong enough not to lose her love for children, considering the fact that at the end of the movie she goes to Chicago with the Little Bear. This shows us just how people can react to a bad situation, they either get mad and become monsters or they become better and stronger, it's always up to us. I think everyone who's searching for wisdom, morality and humanity should watch this movie and someone who's just too much into action and someone who's not seeking hidden meanings should search for another movie.",Hostiles

The way they handled the character arcs and personalities they had just shows how good is Scott Cooper as a director when it comes to western drama. Great story, it really shows how people can change their judgment what stereotypes caused about different races at that time if they're willing to. Also shows us how cruel and destructive they can be if they don't want to change their opinion, or if it's about surviving.

456,agamemnonsb,A Study in Death.,9,31 January 2018,"Hostiles.Hostiles is a sightseeing tour through every form of evil the Old West seems to offer. Christian Bale, in the guise of Army Capt. Joseph Blocker is charged to escort Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hawk and his family back to Montana on parole at the tail end of the 19th Century.Expansive visuals, well shot. Solid character acting, with minimal dialog to work from. At times, it seems like a silent movie.If Westerns are uncommon, Cavalry movies are rare. I don't recall one since John Wayne. Where westerns generally focus on individual justice, on law and vendetta, or gold lust or exploration, depicting the Army from the inside is a different animal. A history of the brotherhood is different, because it's so often involuntary. The common cause of violence amidst self-sanctioned poverty. Together, alone. No matter the state of the frontier, the Cavalry cut its path from lampost to campfire in Enemy Territory, far from reinforcement or communication.Hostiles is a study in death. It's a picture in why we take up causes so far from home. Willingly, and those thrust upon us by circumstance. It's a redemption story, but it's also a story about the impact murder has on the soul of the murderer, the various fates that carrying hate within and alongside brings down among you. It has no bystanders, and many victims. Change can't be undone, it can only be moved forward.There seems to be a habit, dating well back historically, of Englishmen adopting lands far from their own in preference to England, of endeavoring to become one with Chinese ceremony, or Indian jungle, or Arabic desert.I think Christian Bale likes making westerns.",Hostiles

The horrors of war was visible in the eyes of the actors and actresses. It was really quite powerful if not brutal. The story keeps you hooked wanting to see what happens as you are taken along a perilous journey with an unpredictable outcomes - never knowing who to trust and questioning each characters motives and morality. The film has many deep levels coping with loss and what defines a human being even when faced with the temptation of vengeance. There was some criticism about the political correction of the film. We must remember it is a piece of fiction and as such it would not be fair to be bias towards a particular race or creed of people. In fact, it would be very wrong. That's not what the film is about. The writers did an admiral job of maintaining that balance by telling the audience a person can be good or evil it doesn't matter where you come from or what you have done.

Characters that you easily fell in love with die, so you got the feeling that the main character actually could die. A lot of the characters had an early death even though they seemed interesting, then they were replaced by new characters, so when a lot of the characters died you feel nothing because you were just introduced to that person 20 minutes ago and they only had 5 lines of dialogue leading up to their death.

462,GThorn75,Just the Facts,2,22 January 2018,"From a cultural perspective, this film has well documented issues, so I'm sticking to the facts:The premise of this movie is absurd. In 1892, train service from New Mexico to Montana was available via multiple routs. DILEMMA SOLVED with a handful of train tickets. All aboard to the movie playing in the theater next door!Also by 1892, the Indian wars were over. The Indian threat in the West was virtually nil. Comanche raids were unheard-of in the 1880's, let alone in 1892! It takes 30 seconds to Google that stuff before writing.If, for some non-existent reason, a small Army detail escorting prisoners was authorized to hoof it from NM to Montana in 1892, they would take well-worn trails and roads, resupplying at about 20 spots along the way. A 1000 mile, off-road odyssey would take 4 month. Two mules packed with supplies?? That gets you about 100 miles out. Off-trail blazing through steep mountain timber? The rout depicted is fantastical and absurd. I'm surprised their horses weren't tight-rope walking the Continental Divide for the entire trip. That would make for some nice cinematography, also!Why the heck did the lady remain with the Army escort for the entire flippn' trip to Montana? Army won't allow that, no matter how bajiggity she is. They would have dumped her in the first of a dozen towns along the way. Besides, didn't she want to notify someone that HER ENTIRE FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED!?

I can't comment on the rest of this movie because I walked out.

I love how this movie tries to show both sides of the coin. Today we are taught that the white man was horrible and mean and cruel and Indians were all peace loving tranquil people until we came along. The main character in this movie is not racist but has simply seen the worst of the Indians and what they were capable at times. He lets his heart fill up with hatred, but time and time again he is reminded that he himself is no angel either. Also was very happy to see the great relationship between the african american soldier and the main character. Too many times we are bombarded with the image that every white man back during that time was racist and cruel and hated everybody non-white.

Create the story between these people and ill believe it.Ok here is some spoilers so stop reading if you want to know nothing.The most dramatic part of the movie is the very beginning, this family is murdered by some native americans. It already feels odd because the father is cutting wood and the mother and girls are working on reading. They have a small house in the middle of now where and it already strikes me because this is a small family trying to live off the land and they are not doing anything. Besides the point they all die besides the mom.Now the rest of the movie is a bit slow with random jumps of gun fights. The dialogue in the movie is basically about the humanity of these men. Its like you took todays SJW and let them write a script for a western.Its just not real to me and when you have a movie trying to take itself seriously you kind of feel drowned in it. The pacing is a bit slow, character development isnt really there, there is alot of digging scenes and burying of the friends and family.With the story not being believable dialogue wise i dont understand how you could feel so invested in a movie when it is trying to be a serious movie.",Hostiles
474,leeroy-89405,Realistic,10,14 June 2018,"Best western of the brutality of the old west. R rated for continual violence but not overly done. Action packed. Not a chick flick or for the squeamish. Moves quickly and leaves viewer wanting more. Every person has murder in them if necessary. That's how we've survived and changed the world. for the better??
If you can't see behind the obvious, you missed it!!",Hostiles
475,Metaldiecore,Movie's got problems,6,30 December 2018,"Like all of Scott Cooper's movies, Hostiles has some problems. Big problems.First, the good. Christian Bale's acting is amazing. In fact, all of the acting is really great. Not a single character stuck out as being poorly acted. The movie is also very beautiful at times. Some great cinematography on display. There are I think 3 pretty heavy action scenes.The bad. The movie is very slow. I can get behind measured pacing, but this movie could have been 90 minutes and gotten it's point across.There are story decisions made that just don't add up. In brief, In 1890 an army squad is tasked with taking a dying Cheyenne chief to his home in southern Montana. They meet many others along the way. Everybody learns about their wrongs and it's sunshine and rainbows. (Not really)My first issue is with Rosamund Pike's character. She loses her family to a Comanche raid in a brutal opening scene. The group finds her and offers to take her to safety after burying said dead family. Once they got to Colorado, that should have been the end of her story, but she keeps tagging along on this dangerous mission for no other reason than she likes/feels safe around Christian Bale. This would never happen in real life. The army doesn't regularly let civilians unnecessarily travel with them along dangers missions. But she (SPOILERS) needs to be there to adopt the Indian boy and be the white savior at the end.A lot of the characters simply die off screen. Multiple times this happens. We don't get to see what happens. Sometimes we don't even see the aftermath, we are just told ""So-and-so is dead."" It works in one early scene with the Comanche raiders, but after that it feels like the director thought staging an aftermath scene was easier than filming what happened.There are some weirdly progressive views about how the one black man in the movie was treated in 1890. While certainly possible, it feels a little revisionist with his commanding officer literally crying at him being left behind in a hospital. Not dead. Just left in the hospital while they continue the mission.Villian's like Ben Foster's character receive a lot of tension and build up to be pretty deflated in the end. The scene with the trappers also deflates after building up a lot of tension. There is a total of one instance (the ending) in which the movie capitalizes on the tension it builds.There are lots of other nitpicks to have about the movie, I could go on for an hour too long, like this movie does, but I won't.It's not a bad movie, it just such a movie-movie. It's a ""because movie"" movie.",Hostiles

477,raulhbunbury,A Move That Shows The Possible Character of a Man,10,29 August 2018,"I love this movie. It's one of those that make man character and braveness shine. It helps me understand how a strong spirit cannot be broken, even when friends and fellow men are left behind... Great Job.",Hostiles
478,anthonycorte,Factual Accuracy,8,16 September 2018,"I'm one that likes to verify facts in movies. If you're going to mention a town or military installation, it should be accurate. I've tried looking up Fort Winslow everywhere and I can't find it...",Hostiles
479,shellove-61529,Christian Bale 10/10,10,25 September 2018,"Best thing I've seen Christian Bale in since the Machinist.
Found it can be watched over again.
Would recommend to anyone as a film which catches your attention and you emotions.",Hostiles
480,annaorioli,Booooooring,3,7 May 2019,"I don't find the film interesting. People dying all the time, but we don't know anything about them neither at the beginning neither at the end. Very slow film and it's a séquence ok scenes witch are not relevant. The actors interpretate the part quite good but still I didn't found any connection to the emotional dimention.",Hostiles
481,wallflower-22313,Disappointed,5,7 October 2018,I Thought Christian bale would be more handsome. He is very weird looking.,Hostiles
482,bknight-27662,Absolutely great Western,10,28 November 2018,Acting was phenomenal as was the characters Actually had a great storyline and purpose to the film.,Hostiles
483,mfarretta,Convenient clichés abound,3,10 December 2018,"Rosamund Pike's character has never used a shovel, nor witnessed one in use, despite living on a farm and presumably having grown up on a farm. Her dead husband's hat fits her perfectly. She recoils in horror at the sight of the Native Americans in the party, but warmly accepts the extra dress they inexplicably possess, and inexplicably wish to give her.
The movie makes the black guy a singer, and a preacher, and the first to make the lead white guy's eyes leak--it feels preachy and unnatural, as though Hollywood was saying ""look! we're being progressive! See the nice black guy?""
The Army inexplicably allows the white lady to tag along for fun while they escort prisoners across (theoretically) enemy territory. Other reviewers have noted eloquently the reality of that territory during the represented time frame--not so much enemy.
The geography doesn't make any sense, the weather is a little confusing. An Army dude gets beat up and doesn't shout for help, the Army dudes let women (including prisoners) wander out of sight where they are kidnapped for another unnecessary ""twist"" in the plot.
Overall: tedious and weak. With some good actors and lovely landscapes.",Hostiles
484,jhartshorn-32665,Humanistic and delicate,9,29 January 2019,"This is a rare brew film, mixing a number of social impact and humanistic messages into a extremely well shot and well written western. It has a finess that the Sergio Leon westerns couldn't being to understand while exhibiting the same gritty and visceral moments that his films served up so well. Christian Bale is outstanding and delivers one of his finest performances made even better by the supporting characters whom are so well cast and interweave their own dynamic into a epic and sprawling tale that crosses a number of boundaries that challenge the viewer and should elicit a range of emotional responses along the way. Like the messaging in the film The Outlaw Josey Wales, this isn't about good versus bad, Indian vs settler, rancher vs bandit, it's much much, much more. It explores the commonality that is borne of shared experience and the empathetic relationship that is built by people under shared duress. A great, great film.",Hostiles
