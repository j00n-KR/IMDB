0,MartinHafer,Much more cartoony and silly than previous Batmans....and often an insult to your intelligence.,2,8 March 2019,"""Batman & Robin"" is currently #58 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List....which would indicate it's a truly horrible film. Interestingly, despite there being many horrible superhero movies (such as ""The Spirit"" and ""Catwoman""), this and ""Superman IV"" are the only ones currently on the list....so it's quite a dubious achievement!Despite ""Batman & Robin"" being a terrible film, it is interesting to note that despite the film costing an ungodly $125,000,000 to make...it DID manage to earn about double the cost...making it Warner Brothers' biggest moneymaker of the year. It's bad press did, however, help destroy the franchise until it was revived and revamped several years later with Christian Bale and Chrisopher Nolan.When the film started, I could almost see instantly why the movie was a stinker. It was completely cartoonish compared to the previous Batman films of the 80s and 90s. Seeing Batman and Robin in a hockey game with Mr. Freeze and his minions simply made me cringe...as did the sound effects throughout the film. Several times, the punching and kicking sounds were pretty much straight from the campy old TV series....and fans must have been infuriated to see the series turned into a dumbed down cartoonish nightmare. Did the stupidity in this scene get any worse in this opening scene? Yup...when Freeze escapes in a rocket (???) and Batman and Robin chase the film leaps into ultra-stupid mode! It ended hellishly, with Batman and Robin both jumping from the rocket on sky surfboards and they miraculously survived--and during their descent Robin yells out 'Cowabunga'!! What follows rarely got much better...and again and again the film resorted to cartoonism instead of making a decent film that wouldn't infuriate audiences.Another horrible scene was the homage to Marlene Dietrich in her dance scene from ""Blonde Venus"". The Dietrich dance was dumb....the version with Uma Thurman managed to make it even stupider. Seeing her in magenta gorilla costume was indeed stupid!To make everything worse, Miss Thurman overacted terribly throughout the film and I'd say she was the weakest and most annoying actor in the cast....and I assume she was only doing what the director and writer instructed her to do. The same can be said about all the horrid puns uttered by Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze....he was just doing what he was told to do. And, ultimately the crap dialog between the three crime fighters is pretty much the same...the delivered the crap that they were given.In order to have made a good film, ""Batman & Robin"" should have learned SOMETHING from ""Batman"" (1989). It should have been darker, had one GOOD villain instead of three lousy ones and not given way to cheap stunts and gimmickery. Instead of a dark, brooding story, this one looks almost like it was filmed inside a carnival fun house...complete with glow in the dark neon paint and one dimensional characters.Overall, a truly horrid pile of vomit. The film manages to earn a 2...but only because for $125,000,000 the film ultimately must look good...at least at times.So was there anything I liked about the movie? Well, I did laugh at the scene where Mr. Freeze was watching the Snow Miser from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" TV special...and he tried to make his minions sing along with him. It was dumb...but it did make me laugh and was one of the few moments that I didn't hate myself for watching this movie.",Batman & Robin
1,TheLittleSongbird,Definitely the worst of the Batman movies.,3,11 May 2009,"The film does have nice costumes, and nice sets. Unfortunately that is about it. One major problem is some of the choices of actors.They were all wasted. George Clooney is quite a charming actor, but he is not my idea of Batman. Batman I don't think is supposed to be charming, he's supposed to be dark and brooding, and Clooney lacked that. What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film. This is further disadvantaged by a truly pathetic script that nobody in the cast could do anything with.(these actors deserved so much better)The special effects were okay, but very confused in terms of execution. In conclusion, not the worst movie, I have ever seen, but it is one of those films, where everything needed to make it memorable falls flat. 3/10 for effort. Bethany Cox",Batman & Robin
2,Leofwine_draca,Unfairly maligned,6,19 September 2021,"Unfairly maligned by just about everyone, I saw this at the cinema and am not ashamed to say I enjoyed it. It's the only BATMAN film to retain the pure comic book camp of the 1960s TV show, with funny humor throughout - mainly thanks to guest stars Thurman and Schwarzenegger - and a light, colourful atmosphere.",Batman & Robin
3,SnoopyStyle,Joel Schumacher finally destroys Batman,3,30 March 2014,"Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) face a new villain in Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He was a scientist researching a way to freeze his terminally ill wife when an accident turns him into a super-villain. Now he needs diamonds to run his subzero suit, and turn Gotham into permanent winter. Meanwhile Dr. Jason Woodrue uses the powerful Venom concoction to transform a skinny psycho killer into muscle bounded Bane. Botanist Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) who is a radical plant protector objects to Venom's use. Woodrue tries to kill her but she turns into Poison Ivy instead. As Poison Ivy, her pheromones can affect men and kill with a kiss. Then Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough)'s niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) comes to town and eventually takes her place as Batgirl.Joel Schumacher took two tries, but he finally finishes off the original Batman franchise started by Tim Burton. He took the already silly 'Batman Forever' and increases the cartoon nature of his Batman movies. He set out to make a cartoon, and that what he got. The silly campy nature is fine for the first 30 minutes. It's stupidity has a crazy charm to it. Even Robin yelling ""COWABUNGA!"" was stupid enough to be funny. But it really wears out. The last half of the movie is pure torture.Schwarzenegger is playing the cartoon villain to its limits. I could never complain about his work. He does what he's told to do. Bane is completely voiceless and has about as much charisma. Poison Ivy seems to be an inferior villain. It's obvious that Batman and Robin just needs a face mask with breathing filters against her. The constant bickering between Batman and Robin is draining. And I don't know what's the point of Batgirl other than shoving another character in here.",Batman & Robin
4,Prismark10,"Bad man, really bad",1,30 July 2013,"Oh Dear. Oh Dear.Joel Schumacher had previously displayed some directorial flair in movies such as Flatliners. He was no hack so he should had been good choice to take over the Batman films from Tim Burton.However, Batman Forever was disappointing, saddled with a weak script and the competing egos of various actors.Batman & Robin was poor from the word go. To call the script bad is actually an insult to bad screenwriters.Schumacher seems to have forgotten what a big franchise the Batman films were and what a big turnaround Warner Brothers did to get away from the campy 1960s TV series. He wanted to return to the days of the TV show.Val Kilmer departed the cape after just one film. He certainly dodged a bullet. George Clooney took over the cape, he probably was cheaper at the time and being in a cape meant that his double could do most of the work while he still filmed his TV series ER.Nobody acquitted themselves well here because they are saddled with a poor script and bad direction. Chris O Donnell is just petulant. Uma Thurman who came into this film with an Oscar nomination from Pulp Fiction is campier than Liberace.Arnold Schwarzenegger who displayed a talent for light comedy in Twins is again out of place here as Mr Freeze. His jokes feel cold and predictable.The film is a turkey of the highest proportions and is unwatchable.",Batman & Robin
5,classicsoncall,"""This is why Superman works alone.""",4,21 February 2014,"My summary quote of George Clooney's Batman during the opening sequence pretty much says it all. In this, the fourth and final film of the first Batman movie cycle, it appears that all stops were pulled in trying to emulate the Adam West TV series from the Sixties. The entire picture is pure camp and hard to take seriously if you're a true fan of the costumed hero. Not only that, but the actor portraying the main title character isn't even listed at the top of the credits. Instead it's Arnold Schwarzenneger in the thankless role of the film's main antagonist, Mr. Freeze. I sure would like to know what he thinks about this picture today.The idea of three heroes squaring off against three villains was certainly overkill here, especially when characters like Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) and Bane (Jeep Swenson) seemed superfluous to the story most of the time. I recall thinking when the picture came out what a waste of time it was to use the Bane character here since he was so formidable in the comics. After all he broke Batman's back and was the new terror of Gotham in the late Nineties. In this picture he's done in by a few mere body blows and it's curtains for the Banester. Very disappointing.If there's anything to write home about it would be everyone's favorite bad girl, Uma Thurman, as the mischievous Poison Ivy. She calls to mind Julie Newmar's take on the Catgirl of the Adam West days, although a bit overdone with the environmental puns. In another time and place, say the 1940's, a horror flick utilizing an aloe blood and skin with chlorophyll gimmick would have been pretty nifty. I can just see Bela Lugosi sending out his creation with a poison kiss to do away with his enemies.One thing that was cool (no pun intended there) was seeing Jesse Ventura in a quick cameo as an Arkham Asylum prison guard. So that would make it the third time that two future governors appeared in a picture together. ""Predator' and ""The Running Man"" were the other two. Makes you wonder how these guys ever got elected.",Batman & Robin
6,lee_eisenberg,What did any of us do in a past life to merit this awfulness?!,1,14 September 2005,"I will never forgive myself for spending money to see this litany of stupidity. Whereas ""Batman Forever"" at least has Jim Carrey to steal the show, ""Batman & Robin"" has no one. All that it does is make you feel like your brain is melting. You can't even imagine how bad it is, and believe you me, YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT!!! The ""plot"" (I'd be giving it too much credit had I not included the quote marks) has Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) battling villains Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), while Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) joins the Dynamic Duo. But most of the movie involves a bunch of mind-numbing stunts, explosions, etc. There aren't even any good quotable lines, and Mr. Freeze's weapon gets old pretty quickly. Adding insult to injury, they just had to include a sappy subplot about butler Alfred (Michael Gough) having ""McGregor's syndrome""; after watching this movie, you'll wish that you could get some fatal disease rather than having to live with the memory of watching this. I've already wasted too much time talking about this movie. All that I can say is: AT ALL COSTS, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",Batman & Robin
7,jboothmillard,Batman & Robin,2,17 March 2005,"This is one of the worst films I've seen, the other three Batman films (especially the first one) were way better than this, from Razzie nominated director Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever, Phone Booth). Razzie nominated Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr. Freeze, he cares too much about his wife, but that's obviously the point for him being evil. George Clooney plays Batman, when he is Bruce Wayne he is corny. Razzie nominated Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, he needs to take a chill pill because he gets so stressed out with Batman saying that he can't trust him. Uma Thurman plays Poison Ivy, she is pretty I suppose but she talks too much, and she obviously cares more about her plants and flowers than anything else. Razzie winning Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, okay looking I suppose, but could of done a bit more. Also starring Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon, Michael Gough as Alfred, Elle Macpherson as Julie Madison, Independence Day's Vivica A. Fox as Ms. B. Haven and Jeep Swenson as Bane. The rest is obviously no good action with okay fights, it's just a rubbish not very super hero film. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song for ""The End is The Beginning is The End"", Worst Screen Couple for Clooney and O'Donnell, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Pretty poor!",Batman & Robin
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Hey, Lighten Up Batman Fans!",7,9 March 2006,"Most people, especially fans of the earlier Batman films, hated this movie. I did not. In fact, although it's not my favorite in the series (my vote goes to Batman Returns), I still found this refreshing in its cartoon-ish innocence. After all, it is based on a cartoon, so what is so unforgivable about making it light-hearted just once. Does everything have to be dark and brooding? I hope not. Well, unfortunately, people like the darkness more than the light. Just look at the reviews here, for an example of that.I just went along for the ride on this, enjoying the outlandish characters and corny-but-humorous lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Both were a lot of fun to watch. Batman, meanwhile, has been played by some many actors I don't care anymore who has the role.....its' nothing to get serious about, anyway.Whoever seems to play him does a decent job. This Batman version seems a lot more softer character, higher-principled and compassionate....sort of the real-life wacko (George Clooney) who views himself as such as a knight in shining armor for the typical Hollywood Left Wing crowd. But....we'll forgive him, for he not knows what he says.I appreciated the added humor in this film, the fact there almost no profanity, unlike the other versions; the wild special effects, ogling Uma Thurman, who looked fantastic; great color and surround sound; interesting sets and a nice message at the end.The negatives were: a little too much action which can make you dizzy trying to follow; a somewhat-annoying Robin (Chris O'Donnell); Alicia Silverstone's role as Batgirl adding nothing to the film; and a little too many sexual innuendos to counteract the absence of profanity, I suppose.Overall, a fun movie not to be taken seriously: simply a cartoon come to life, which is what some people think it should have been in the first place.",Batman & Robin
9,Tweekums,"Batman and Robin are joined with Batgirl to defeat Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane",6,4 May 2017,"Along with the partner, Robin, he gained in the previous film Batman take on Mr Freeze; a villain who lives up to his name. After an accident in his laboratory he has a condition that means he must always remain below zero and steals diamonds to power his cold-suit. He escapes from their first encounter and plots what to do next. Meanwhile in a lab in South America Dr Pamela Isley is working on a project to combine plants with venomous animals. Her boss uses the venom to create 'super-soldier' Bane before trying to kill Isley; he fails but his actions turn her into Poison Ivy; a woman who can produce pheromones that no man can resist and a deadly kiss. She, along with Bane, come to Gotham hoping to persuade Bruce Wayne to back her ecological agenda he isn't so keen on the fact that it would lead to billions of deaths! If that weren't enough Alfred's niece, Barbara, turns up and inevitably learns the secret behind Batman and Robin before becoming Batgirl. If Gotham is to be saved, the three of them will have to work together to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy; something made harder by the fact that Ivy has turned Batman and Robin against each other.'Batman Forever' was noticeably lighter in town than the first two films and anybody hoping things would return to a darker style will be disappointed. This is even more camp with villains and heroes alike spouting corny one-liners at every opportunity. The villains are no longer ordinary people gone bad; Freeze, Ivy and Bane have all been mutated in some way and are clearly mad. The effects are pretty good for the most part although Ivy's vines don't look like real plants. The story is silly but not without its charms; the light tone means it can be enjoyed by younger viewers; there are a few scary moments but nothing too intense. It is safe to say that just about all of the main cast has done much better work. The story is a bit cluttered with three new villains and the introduction of Batgirl. On the subject of Batgirl it would appear that her Uncle Alfred is a bit of a dirty old man given the body hugging costume he designed for her! Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see unless you are a Batman completest, I must admit I enjoyed it more than I expected though. Another plus about this film is that if it hadn't 'killed the franchise' we probably wouldn't have had the reboot trilogy!",Batman & Robin
10,BA_Harrison,"Holy Crapfest, Batman!",3,21 April 2018,"I was in the crowd at the UK premiere for Batman & Robin in Leicester Square, cheering as the stars arrived on the red carpet. Had I already seen the film, boos would have been more appropriate. I'm no fan of Christopher Nolan's dreary oh-so-serious Batman movies, but even they are preferable to this abomination, a neon coloured nightmare of frivolous, cartoonish nonsense, director Joel Schumacher dialling the camp up to eleven, while simultaneously turning the fun and excitement down to zero.Talking of zero, Arnold Schwarzenegger is absolutely dire as ice-cold, wise-cracking Mr. Freeze, but Uma Thurman goes one better (or should that be one worse?) as Poison Ivy, her Mae West inspired performance about as hammy as it gets. As far as the good guys are concerned, George Clooney is horribly miscast as Batman, the actor never believable as anyone other than George Clooney, while Chris O'Donnell's Robin comes across as an irritating impetuous child, and Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl exists purely to add some girl power.From the opening shots of our heroes' rubber clad butts and moulded suit nipples, to the boring 'climax' that had me struggling to stay awake, this film is a colossal misfire and an embarrassment to all involved.A pitiful 3/10, although I nearly deducted a point for the silly cartoon sound effects that occasionally accompany the action.",Batman & Robin
11,moonspinner55,This is what the franchise has sadly turned into...,2,25 May 2001,"A camp adventure studded with marquee names, but no real ties anymore to Bob Kane's revered comics. Gotham City has become a disco palace, and the villains of the piece (Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy) aren't very threatening or thrilling. Worst of the lot: Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, looking very uncomfortable away from the shopping mall. Arguably the weakest in the series, although this is no reflection on George Clooney as the Caped Crusader; he's workman-like in the role. Written (poorly) by Akiva Goldsman, who is embarrassingly fond of 'Dick' jokes; directed (very poorly) by Joel Schumacher, who needs to start growing up. * from ****",Batman & Robin
12,Quinoa1984,Worst Film of 1997,3,25 July 2000,"Uggh, this film has never gotten any better since I've watched it.Matter of fact, it's gotten worse over time (re-edit, 2015): The major problem here is with tone - it's not simply that the movie is campy. The 1966 Batman movie, from the TV show (I forget if it was before or during the show) was a massive success, in that it kept its comedic tone fresh and sharp and light. Here, the film is campy and ridiculous, but it's still technically set in the universe set up by Tim Burton (he is not producer here, like on Forever, but there's still Michael Gough and Pat Hingle in key roles), and it just wobbles from place to place. At times the film goes for the utterly inane and over-the-top, which could be fun with Schwarzenegger there (and hey, I can laugh my head at the ice puns - laugh AT, of course, not with). But aside from Uma Thurman, who seems to be in on the joke, or really 'get' how to do a campy villainess ala Julie Newmar, it's sad-mopey-serious one moment (Alfred's sick plot line) and then... there's Bane, who makes cartoon henchmen look bad. It's at times more cartoonish than the Batman animated series ever was - which had a more subdued take on Mr. Freeze, if you can believe that - and when it tries anything close to dramatic or dark, it falls flat on its face. It is a disgrace for both Joel Schumacher and the cast. The story (which makes Ski Patrol look like Citizen Kane) has Batman and Robin now joined by Batgirl (how many do we need) to stop Poison Ivy nd her new co-hort, Mr. Freeze. Oh, and Coolio shows up at one point as part of a gang! Because... reasons. If people tell you they liked this film, well, more power to you. And if you're looking to get wasted and not give a s*** when it comes to a movie, have at it. The script is so terrible one will find the Nolan over-exposition of the Dark Knight and Rises to be like Hamlet. BEWARE.",Batman & Robin
13,michaelRokeefe,Crime fighters and partners to the end.,6,26 April 2000,"ZAP. POW. ZING. I was surprised that I watched the whole movie. I had my doubts at first. This is not the best of the Batman movies, but it does hold your interest. It is wonderful to watch. The scenery, backdrops, and music gave this thing a life.I like George Clooney, but not as Batman. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy was the best acted character. Arnold Scwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze was pretty hokey and over the top. Chris O'Donnell was pedestrian as Robin. Pat Hingle was quite animated as Commissioner Gordon. Alicia Silverstone was winsome as Batgirl.The fast pace of the story took your mind off of the length of the movie.

14,sunwarrior13,The Final Installment Of Batman Series,5,15 September 2012,"Batman & Robin is a film directed by Joel Schumacher. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is the fourth and final installment of Batman film series, and is a sequel to Batman Forever, with George Clooney as Bruce Wayne and Batman. The returning cast features Chris O'Donnell as Robin, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. It tells the story of Batman and Robin as they attempt to stop villains Mr. Freeze,played by Arnold Schwarzenegger; Poison Ivy,portrayed by Uma Thurman; and Bane,played by Robert Swenson from covering Gotham City with ice and vegetation while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. It also features the introduction of Alfred's niece Barbara Wilson, who later aids Batman and Robin in the form of Batgirl,portrayed by the beauteous Alicia Silverstone.The movie fails to deliver anything of merit or worth at every turn for one,the storytelling isn't interesting and boring; and the characters lack energy particularly Clooney,who never for one minute gave life to Batman.The villains, Arnold Schwarzenegger and especially Uma Thurman remain the highlights in it but the others involved simply the viewer can't just even care for.Too bad that the Batman series has to end this way.",Batman & Robin

17,hitchcockthelegend,"And introducing Batgirl for more ""crooks"" to spoil the broth.",3,29 September 2014,"Batman & Robin have to not only tackle Mr Freeze & Poison Ivy, but also inner fighting, Alfred's health problems, and a fledgling Batgirl! Director Joel Schumacher couldn't believe his luck with the success of Batman Forever, so much so he kept the campy formula and upped the ante big time, the result was - until Christopher Nolan's reinvention in 2005 - the death of the franchise, going out in a whimper and a hail of stinging verbals.It starts off quite promising, our heroes in a slam bang corking action sequence fighting the monstrous Mr Freeze, and then we are tantalised by the sexy transformation of Uma Thurman into Poison Ivy who is accompanied by the beast that is Bane, but then...Compoast!Well it goes down hill fast, stupid puns and gimmicks at every opportunity instead of character building, with Batman producing a Batman Credit Card on the 45 minute mark sounding the death knell. Crashes and wallops at every possible turn make the head spin in a bad way, and then we have Alicia Silverstone as Barbara Wilson, Alfred's niece and of course the afore mentioned fledgling Batgirl. She forgets the character is meant to be English (probably Schumacher forgot it as well?), she can't fight for toffee, and, well, she looks uncomfortable saying the basic moronic dialogue. It comes to something when you are making a blockbuster comic book adaptation and Arnold Schwarzenegger is badly miscast, and he is, a simply awful for the money performance from the usually reliable action meat head.I will however give George Clooney a tiny bit of support, perhaps a bit too underplayed as Bruce Wayne, he still looks good in the Bat suit and at the very least convinces as a charming caped crusader, and he is part of the best Bruce/Alfred scene in the whole franchise. But ultimately he is wrong for the part, something which he himself would agree with later on down the road. Overall it's a big misfire that is rightly reviled in most quarters, the best I can say for it is that my then 4 year old nephew thought the crash bang wallops were fun, and there my friends you have the target audience.

18,preppy-3,Talk about overkill!,1,29 December 2007,"Batman (George Clooney) and Robin battle Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). Meanwhile Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying and his niece (Alicia Silverstone) visits and becomes Batgirl! Oh yeah--and Bane is helping Ivy...Wow--what a MESS! I never liked the first two Batman films (too dark and violent). The third was light but fun. This is just moronic from the word go. There are tons of bad jokes flying left and right from heroes and villains (if Arnie had made one more ""cold"" joke I would have screamed!). No dialogue--just stupid jokes. I knew I was in trouble during the first big fight sequence: Batman and Robin are battling Mr. Freeze but are sliding on the ice he produces. They're on their backs boots in the air, click the boots together...and SKATES pop out!!!!! Even for a comic book film that was ridiculous! The plot is thin to begin with, but at the end it's just completely incomprehensible. Its like the screenwriters threw up their hands and gave up. The movie is always throwing things at you--never stopping for breath. At first it's fun...but it wears you down. There's an entire motorcycle race thrown in for no reason! GREAT special effects...but that's all there is. Also the homoeroticism in here is upped to a ridiculous degree. Can ANYONE explain why Batman and Robins suits have nipples???? And why doesn't Silverstone's suit have them? Isn't that sexist? And why does O'Donnell have a bigger cod piece than Clooney? Acting is pretty poor. Clooney (who admits that he hated the film) looks uncomfortable and (he says) he played Bruce Wayne as gay. I never caught that though--and I'm gay! O'Donnell is drop dead handsome and drop dead bland. He plays Robin as an obnoxious brat--again (he did it in ""Batman Forever"" too). I kept waiting for Clooney to deck him. Silverstone is OK I guess. Gough is given nothing to do but look sick. Schwarzenegger--he never COULD act and his reciting of the ""comic"" lines are painful. Thurman seems so totally lost that she got desperate--she vamps it up to an embarrassing degree. Her lines were SO pathetic I actually groaned aloud and rolled my eyes a few times! Only John Glover is any fun by hamming it up mercilessly as the mad (sigh) scientist who creates Bane.Big, loud and incredibly stupid.

But this has some ""so bad it's good"" qualities whereas Forever was just a total misfire. Schwarzenegger hams it up with glee. His entire dialogue seems to be a never ending series of cold puns. Uma Thurman takes her part a little more seriously, which is pathetic when you think about it. Chris O'Donnell is childlike and irritating. George Clooney is vacant and seems mentally checked-out of the role. This one pretty much killed the careers of Alicia Silverstone and Joel Schumacher, as well as badly wounding the Batman franchise.

21,zardoz-13,Trouble in Gotham City Again!,7,4 August 2009,"Watching ""Batman & Robin,"" the fourth cinematic outing in the Warner Brothers' franchise, is like sitting through a Broadway musical staged as a series of wrestling matches. Batman (George Clooney of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") and Robin (Chris O'Donnell of ""Batman Forever) are poised in one corner of the ring on the side of justice. The time around the Boy Wonder chafes at his second banana status. He wants a super hero car and his own signal light! Batman grimaces: ""That's why Superman works alone."" Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone of ""Clueless"") is the latest recruit to the Caped Crusader's clan. Uncle Alfred's bodacious niece, she loves to race motorcycles. Opposite our heroes and heroines in the other corner are Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""True Lies""), a human stalagmite dressed like a bug lamp, and the venomous botanical Botticelli-like Venus dubbed Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman of ""Pulp Fiction"") whose lips carry a toxic kiss. Audiences get to ogle these overdressed fiends as they battle Batman and Robin amid several fabled settings for two hours in far-fetched situations. The combat scenes suffer from a choreographed look that detracts from the spontaneity of the fighting. Indeed, everything about ""Batman & Robin"" is as staged and predictable as a wrestling match.Nevertheless, ""Batman & Robin"" qualifies as ideal summer fare. This surefire formula has been served up once again with a high quota of action but relatively little violence. Nobody should leave this movie warped enough to imitate any of the stunts. While surpassing ""Batman Forever,"" ""Batman & Robin"" sports few of the vicious vibes of the mean-spirited Tim Burton & Michael Keaton originals. The lively Akiva Goldsman screenplay plumbs the depths of a DC comic book. The screenplay exists as an excuse to catapult Batman into a string of battles with his larger-than-life adversaries. Like some earlier Batman fiends, these new villains are zombies that have defied death.Mr. Freeze stomps around in a subzero cryogenic suit that resembles the RoboCop rig minus the helmet. Freeze survives on diamonds that fuel his cold suit. Meanwhile, he is cooking up a formula to cure his frozen wife of a terminal disease called McGregor's Syndrome. Interestingly, Bruce Wayne's loyal butler Alfred (Michael Gough of ""Horror Hospital"") succumbs to the same illness. If one villain were not enough, Goldsman whistles up a second, the felonious flora known as Poison Ivy who deploys her sire charms to incite rivalry between the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder. Again, the wrestling image of tag teams comes to mind for ""Batman & Robin."" Mind you, the villains are annoying but not odious. Although bald-headed, gimlet-eyed, and blue from head to toe, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't seem very dangerous. His dialogue mixes puns about frigidity with synonyms for the word 'cold.' ""Chill!"" roars Mr. Freeze as he wields an ice gun that turns the police into icicles. Despite his insane laughter and hideous plans, Mr. Freeze never really harms anybody. The heroes manage to thaw out Freeze's victims before they die so his villainy is strictly cosmetic. And Poison Ivy's is essentially no different.""Batman & Robin"" emerges more as a triumph of set design, costuming, and elaborate visual effects over narrative storytelling. The breath-taking, computer-generated baroque sets of Gotham City radiate a surreal quality that is enhanced by the cotton-candy colored fluorescence of the cinematography. Each shot in the movie resembles a panel out of a Batman comic book. Scores of Dutch-tilted MTV-style camera angles punctuate the action to heighten the tension and suspense. The special effects are so dazzling that you will find yourself overwhelmed by them.Making the death-defying obstacles bigger each time helps but only prolongs the certainty that they will survive. Basically, the heroes are getting out of tight spots far too easily. Batman's suit conceals more gadgets than James Bond's tuxedo. Every gadget has been ingeniously contrived to get Batman out of his predicaments. Each device works without fail every time. Our heroes don't even break a sweat, so why should we? The best way to watch ""Batman & Robin"" is to let the absurdities flow over you.Nevertheless, the filmmakers are shrewd. Between the high octane action sequences, a dozen allusions are made about 'family values.' Bruce Wayne shares a tearful moment, for example, with his bed-ridden butler Alfred. Despite its knockabout tactics, ""Batman & Robin"" endorses the family. 'Family values' play a crucial part in the narrative. Batman & Robin quarrel and compete with each other in the film. Eventually, Alfred intervenes and resolves the tensions between our heroes. When the Dynamic Duo reciprocate the trust that solidifies them as a family, they defeat their adversaries.The best part of ""Batman & Robin"" is the subplot that has Alfred ailing. Aside from paunchy Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon, English actor Michael Gough is the only holdover from the original Keaton ""Batman."" Equipped with George Burns' eyeglasses, Alfred furnishes the only genuine warmth in the film. Although the main plot concerns saving the world from Mr. Freeze's ice-capades, Alfred's imminent death weaves the path of hero and villain into a neat, slushy outcome.Director Joel Schumacher succeeds admirably in keeping the plot from getting in the way of either the special efforts or the action. ""Batman & Robin"" is as calculated a summer. Schumacher provides more than enough style to get ""Batman & Robin"" over its alarming lack of substance. Schumacher inherited the franchise from Tim Burton who bailed after ""Batman Returns."" As Hollywood movie directors rank, Schumacher boasts an impressive string of successes. He helmed ""Batman Forever,"" ""A Time to Kill,"" ""Flatliners,"" ""The Lost Boys,"" ""D.C. Cab,"" and ""St. Elmo's Fire."" Schumacher keeps ""Batman & Robin"" moving at a whirlwind pace. He has ushered Batman from the dark side and into the light. The worse thing you can say about ""Batman & Robin"" is that it is a rough and tumble fashion show masquerading as an action movie. Nobody really gets hurt who doesn't deserve their punishment.",Batman & Robin
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"The one positive about this ""film"" is that it was the last of its kind",1,24 November 2007,"If in making this, Schumacher attempted to create a film that looks and feels like a comic book, the man has either never actually opened one such, or all he saw was the bright lights, flamboyance and the worst of the text. This has all that made Batman Forever painful, only much, much more of it. The vast majority of dialog is puns(Arnold has some particularly cringe-inducing one-liners), in particular the lines of the costumed characters, and they're obvious, ridiculous and in no way funny. Gotham City, once seen so dark and bleak, is now bathed in neon lights(in fact, little in the film *isn't*). The tone no longer holds any darkness, it's just comical. All of the acting is overdone. John Glover later redeemed himself on Smallville, proving that he *can* work with material based on comic books without performing like he did herein. We did not need more parodying of the characters; if anyone desired to view such, they'd go watch the 60's series. In trying to outdo those that came before it, the film introduces far too many heroes and villains, and clearly doesn't know what to do with all of them. Batgirl hardly has anything to do, and may very well have been added for the sake of political correctness, and perhaps because Joel wanted another teenager who shows up the adults. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are still there, each playing the same character as they have since the '89 film, in what can only be extreme loyalty, contractual obligation, or both. As with the film before it, one villain's background is neatly summed up whilst we see a brief clip of the transformation... in contrast to how well Burton handled two transformations, in Batman Returns. There is no characterization present. Everyone is flat and one-note. The plot, that of it that isn't just recycled from Forever, is cookie-cutter, plain, silly, and at times makes absolutely no sense(case in point: the master plan of the villains... excuse me?). The cinematography is uninspired, which is odd, because Forever, whilst rather insulting, wasn't bad in that area. The same goes for the editing; here, there's actually a shot that is reversed half-way through, which is really so obvious you have to see it to believe it(perhaps the editor realized how badly it sucked, or maybe he wanted to be fired), footage seems reused, and lines(unnecessary and embarrassing ones, at that) are pasted where they clearly aren't actually spoken. There are *cartoon* sound effects used for some of the action. No, seriously. And to top it all off, this can't even be seen as innocent, pure entertainment, for if the many innuendos(some really not appropriate for children) were not enough, Silverstone actually has a line in which she asks her elderly uncle to dress her. No, it doesn't actually mean what one might think, but still. And does anyone actually *like* the butt shots in the montages of the characters suiting up? Characters are yet again messed with, for no good reason. I've been told that one of the villains is essentially the complete opposite in this of his character in the comics. Batman, as well as Robin, always have the exact gadgets that they need, and the former's detective skills are helped along by the utter carelessness of his enemies. Dialog and characters that hold no other purpose than exposition are strewn about with a complete lack of subtlety. The special effects are usually pretty bad in Forever, there was little to no animation, or it was used so subtly, you couldn't tell. Here, it's plain to see, and it does *not* look real. Really, this has no merit. It is impressive, and in some cases(read: that of the director) sad that anyone working on this film had a career after it. And for this, Schwarzenegger went back on not playing villains anymore? I recommend this to those who must know how bad it is, because there is simply no way to convey it other than a showing. 1/10",Batman & Robin
23,view_and_review,I Just Had To Watch,2,16 October 2020,"I had to watch. In spite of 23 years of avoiding ""Batman & Robin"" and the plethora of negative reviews I still had to see for myself. Is it as bad as they say? Sadly, yes. Joel Schumacher was responsible for ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin,"" two of the worse comic book movies in creation. I hate to sully Schumacher's name because he has so many good movies to his directorial credit. Up until 1997 he had directed ""The Lost Boys,"" ""Flatliners,"" and ""Falling Down""---all stellar movies. You almost have to forgive him for ""Batman & Robin."" The movie was more like a cartoon not a comic book and it was so random. It seemed more like an amalgamation of 20- minute Saturday morning cartoons rather than one singular cohesive movie.As for the cast--just so we can name them and shame them-we had George Clooney as Batman. He was the most disinterested character of the movie. Chris O'Donnell again was Robin. He was shoehorned into the franchise in ""Batman Forever"" and continued to be a poor fit. In this film he fell under the poisonous charm of Poison Ivy which caused him to be at odds with Batman. But not before the two of them ice skated with thugs, and were able to bail out of a rocket and air surf back to Gotham. I know. Ridiculous. Michael Gough again was Alfred and now he's dying. Then there was this totally off the wall insertion of Alicia Silverstone as Alfred's niece, Barbara Wilson; a British street bike racer without the hint of a British accent. She, like any significant character who visits Wayne Manor, found the Bat Cave. She found it by hacking an Alfred file that was protected with the password: Peg. Why not just make the password ABC. Apparently, Alfred was prepared for this eventuality and already had a costume made up for Barbara because if you find the Bat Cave you must become a costumed crime fighter. She chose the incredibly unique name of Bat Girl which caused Batman to remark: ""That's not awfully PC, what about Bat Person or Bat Woman?""The nemeses were Uma Thurman as Pamela Isley aka Poison Ivy. She was just as flirtatious and flamboyant as Michelle Pfeifer's Cat Woman but less athletic. Her goal was to kill all mammals to make way for a world full of plants. She could seduce with a whiff and kill with a kiss. She was such a typical female bad guy using her feminine wiles to get over that Bat Girl took a moment to sermonize on the matter while fighting. Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr. Freeze. He only wanted to find a cure for his ill wife and he would freeze all of Gotham to do it. His character actually wasn't that bad. His lines were bad as was his freeze ray, but he was alright.The one thing they all had in common was their tasteless puns. There were just sooooo many. They made up half the script. Just stop. Were they expecting laughs? Were they expecting people to chime in with, ""Ooooh! I see what you did there."" It was just pitiful.This movie wasn't bad enough to ruin careers, but it certainly was a heckuva stain on the resume.",Batman & Robin
24,neil-476,It's all a matter of taste,6,24 June 2011,"While I wouldn't pretend for a second that this was the best Batman movie ever, I have a lot more time for it than most people. Here is why.I liked George Clooney's Batman and Bruce Wayne. Of the three entrants in the original sequence of movie, he comes closest to me to looking like I expect Batman to look.For the only time out of those four movies, the movie seems to be about Batman rather than the villains: despite Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane all being in it, they don't overpower Batman as the main character.I liked the visual design of much of the film, particularly Gotham - much more like Gotham from the Jerry Robinson-illustrated comics of the 40s and 50s.I liked bringing Alfred in as a plot element, and I also liked the way in which Batgirl was brought in.However, I am neither blind nor stupid, and there was quite a lot which was not too brilliant. Specifically: Much of the humour was a misplaced attempt to hark back to the TV series, and failed dismally.Poison Ivy was horribly, horribly badly realised.Chris O'Donnell's Robin - peevish and whingey.Schwarzenegger's wish for cheesy one-liners should have been resisted.Even so, I don't mind this at all.",Batman & Robin
25,Uriah43,Too Many Characters and Subplots,4,18 February 2017,"This movie pits ""Batman"" (George Clooney) and ""Robin"" (Chris O'Donnell) against a new villain named ""Mr. Freeze"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his band of ice skating thugs who are out to wreck havoc on Gotham City in order to collect a huge bounty and destroy the dynamic duo in the process. To further complicate matters another super villain comes upon the scene by the name of ""Poison Ivy"" (Uma Thurman) who not only has a powerful henchman named ""Bane"" (Jeep Swenson) to do her bidding but also has an insane plan to eliminate all diesel fuels which threaten the fauna of the world-at the expense of all human life on the planet. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie started off okay but as it progressed-and more subplots were introduced-it went downhill fast. For example, although I happen to like Alicia Silverstone, I honestly didn't care for the addition of her character (""Batgirl"") at all. With everything else going on I thought it was simply too much. In short, while I don't consider this movie to be terribly bad necessarily, I must admit that it was rather disappointing overall and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",Batman & Robin
26,anaconda-40658,Worst Batman Ever?,1,30 June 2015,"Batman and Robin (1997): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Chris O'Donnell: Two-hour advertisement boasting high powered special effects and a title that has more to do with Mr. Freeze than the hero duo. He wishes to freeze Gotham City in search of a diamond that can revive his wife. Director Joel Schumacher previously made Batman Forever, which was the best of the franchise to date but here he manages to create the worst. George Clooney dons the bat suit but not a personality. Arnold Schwarzenegger overacts as Mr. Freeze. Part of the problem is that both Batman and Mr. Freeze are battling over worthy causes, and while peace is met, it doesn't give viewers much to root for. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy runs the same drill Michelle Pfeiffer ran as Catwoman in Batman Returns. Justice prevails but not for Thurman who is subdued in a costume and no real zeal. Alicia Silverstone is embarrassing as Batgirl, and what she is doing in the movie is a mystery. She is involved in a pointless road race before allowing viewers to witness how ridiculous she looks in that costume. Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin but despite the title reference, the role is less involving this time out. Easily one of the worst films of the year, everything freezes here accept its horrid existence. Score: 1 / 10",Batman & Robin
27,HotToastyRag,The best one for kids,8,18 December 2018,"I'm a Michael Keaton fan, so in my view, no one else can be Batman but him. I've never actually met anyone who's picked George Clooney as their favorite, so if you watch this one, it'll most likely be for the supporting cast. The adorable Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the equally adorable Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a frosty yet comical villain, and Uma Thurman plays a wicked seductress. See what I mean? You'll probably forget George Clooney is even in it.Unfortunately, this installment wasn't even as successful as its predecessor Batman Forever, which wasn't very good. The consistently good feature shared by both films is the kid-friendly attitude. These are comic book movies, and should be able to be enjoyed by kids of all ages-aren't young folks the target audiences for comic books? The later volumes are far too dark and frightening. The darkest part of the movie is an uninteresting sideplot about Batman's butler Alfred's health-but it can still turn into a funny scene if you make fun of George Clooney's smirk and head tilt instead of paying attention to what he's saying. So, if you're looking for a good one to start your youngster on, this is it.",Batman & Robin
28,FlashCallahan,You're not sending me to the cooler... And chill!!!,5,30 September 2012,"There's a new super villain in town. Mr. Freeze, a former doctor whose blood is laced with cryogenic liquid, causing him to be cold in feeling, plans to freeze Gotham until he gets the money needed to finish finding the cure for a mysterious disease that has stricken his wife. Poison Ivy, a villain with lips full of venom, has arrived in Gotham with her hulking servant, Bane, with plans to team up with Freeze and prepare the way for genetically enhanced plants. Ivy has caused a rift between the partnership of the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder. Alfred, Batman's trusted butler, has developed the same disease that Freeze's wife has. It is in this time of need that a new partner, Batgirl, steps forward to help the two rid the city of evil once more.....It is really difficult to find something good to say about this movie, even more so now that the Nolan trilogy has come to an epic end.But, I am one of those rare film enthusiasts who can get some enjoyment out of most movies, and I remember going to see this at some premiere, and the good reviews film magazines gave it before the backlash began.It's all Schumachers fault though, he really has ruined something special that Burton made, with the over use of neon's, and the truly, truly vomit inducing opening where the camera lingers on the bat butt. Its the low point of the movie.But then there is Schwarzenegger, who appears yo be having a right old time, even if his script does consist of one liners and nothing else, at least the film is entertaining when he is around.Clooney is just okay as Batman, but he spends the movie just arguing with Robin about Poison Ivy, one of Thurmans low points, trying to ooze sexiness, the actress looks embarrassed, despite her beauty.The less said about Bane and bat-girl the better, and some silly subplot regarding Alfred is just wasted.It's neon over the top nonsense, with too many characters and far too much going on, and in the end, it becomes one big homo-erotic mess.But I still find myself going back to it, and sticking around until the end.",Batman & Robin
29,Aaron1375,The film that temporarily derailed the Bat for nearly a decade.,4,28 October 2012,"Joel Schumacher, I am guessing enjoyed the 60's television show featuring Adam West and Burt Ward. Nothing wrong with liking that series, it was funny and did not take itself seriously. It is not how I want my Batman movie to be though! The seeds were planted in the previous film, ""Batman Forever"" which had the good fortune to cast Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey when both were flying high. Carey alone was huge and this is most likely why the film was such a success. This led to the misfortune of Schumacher believing the success of the film was due to the fact he made it all colorful and more cheerful so he was going to up the ante and he did and we were all left to suffer the most dismal Batman film to date. Granted, the second film was a bit odd too which is what left to Burton leaving the director's chair as that one was considered a bit of a disappointment too, but it is nothing compared to this.The story once again thrusts us right in the middle of the action as Batman and Robin go to stop Mr. Freeze. During this opening battle one groans at the many one liners, but the action was not to bad. You also notice that most of what you see during this sequence was featured in the trailers. Yes, sadly this is the highlight of the film, and the only decent action sequence in the movie. The rest has Batman and Robin arguing while trying to capture Freeze while we also witness Pamela Isely become Poison Ivy, much like the previous film had Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face right from the get go and we watched the Riddler come to be. Somehow Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze become allies which is one of the worst pairings of Batman villains I have ever seen. I mean you are pairing a villain who loves plants with a guy who shoots an ice beam...ice beam would be very harmful to plants wouldn't you say? George Clooney takes Val Kilmer's place as Batman for this film, and I am not going to say I loved Michael Keaton in the role of Batman, but I am going to say he was a lot better than the two who tried to replace him. Kilmer was better than Clooney, as Clooney did not look the part of Bruce Wayne or Batman. Chris O'Donnell is absolutely horrid as Robin in this one and Batgirl is a pointless add on whose character was butchered! When I first heard of Arnold being Mr. Freeze I thought he had to big a physique for the good doctor seeing as how it is the armor that Freeze wears that gives him his strength. I did think that Arnold could play Freeze well as Freeze is nearly emotionless at times. Joel Schumacher though decides that Mr. Freeze is going to constantly tell jokes about the fact he is cold, make his minions sing and wear polar bear house shoes. It is an embarrassment! To watch a much better portrayal of Mr. Freeze, just watch the animated series. Then there is Poison Ivy, actually she was alright, a nice sexy villainous whose main fault is the bad pairing with Freeze. She was also in one of the few good scenes that did not appear in the opening...the auction scene. Sexy and funny, then Freeze crashes the party and the lameness is once again in full effect. Finally is the odd inclusion of Bane as a dimwitted servant to Poison Ivy. I did not understand why they added him, at this point he was a terror in the comics a mixture of brawn and brains reduced to just the brawn. Granted, Jeep Swenson who played him did look the part.Many have claimed this to be the worst film of all time. That is a claim I just do not see. It is bad, the worst Batman film I have seen. Just does not seem to be the worst film to me, it is not even the worst comic book film as both the Punisher with Dolph and the 1990 Captain America were both worse than this one to me. I guess you can say both those came out directly on video and bypassed the theater and this is the worst movie to come to the big screen, but once again there is another comic film that was far worse in Superman IV as you had many visible strings and normal humans flying into space with the villain and Superman. So this is bad, just not the worst film or even comic film. There was work put into it and it was almost a breath of air after I had to sit through Forever so many times.So there you have it, is it a good movie? No...no way, no how. Is it bad...YES! I do not give it the title of worst film though. It had some moments in it I enjoyed to much. Granted most of these moments occurred right at the beginning. Still, I think Joel Schumacher meant well and I heard that he planned to make the next film darker, but he did pretty much kill off the first series of movies. Though in the grand scheme of things this did some good as the Nolan trilogy was made and Batman stopped being a set of films for celebrities to try to get the parts and just act like idiots. I heard Julie Roberts was trying to be the Joker's wife in the next film...um, when did the Joker have a wife? I only remember Harley Quinn from the animated series and she is not the Joker's wife. So thankfully Joel only got two movies in, things could have gotten worse, and thanks to him in an indirect way they got better.",Batman & Robin
30,Wuchakk,Easily the best of the four,7,28 April 2012,"Staunch fundamentalist fanboys have declared 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" to be a blasphemous blemish in the superhero's chronicling, but it's easily the most entertaining of the four Batman films that came out between 1989-97.Let's face it, all four of these flicks have the same cartoony tone. They were a couple rungs above the 60's TV series in campiness, but with better costumes and a super budget. And ""Batman & Robin"" was the most entertaining of the four. I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of the goofy/surreal style of these movies; I prefer Christopher's Nolan's raw realistic approach in the Dark Knight trilogy (""realistic"" to a point, that is). It's just that ""Batman & Robin"" is the most entertaining of the earlier series. Which is why I never got the whole ""Tim Burton's Batman is a masterpiece"" mindset. Really? Not to me. It LOOKED great, but the story was tedious.Again, all four of these films have the same general cartoony tone and there's simply no validity to the position that Burton's ""Batman"" or ""Batman Returns"" are more serious/realistic in approach compared to Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin."" I've seen 'em all back-to-back and they each have the same colorful we're-not-taking-this-too-serious style.For anyone to enjoy these films you have to be willing to accept the comic booky world the filmmaker's have created. If you're willing to do that, these can be fun, half-serious Batman movies. You can't watch them expecting the tone of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or you'll be severely let down.With this understanding, ""Batman & Robin"" is my favorite of the four. Here's why:It has the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in George Clooney. Although Val Kilmer has the better Bruce Wayne demeanor (i.e. grimmer), Clooney just LOOKS like Wayne. In addition, he's charismatic and entertaining in the role from beginning to end.It has the best sense of family between the inhabitants of Wayne Manor. The warmth and camaraderie of Bruce, Dick/Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Alfred and Barbara/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is a pleasure to behold.It has Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Nuff said.It has Uma Thurman shining in the role of Poison Ivy. I usually don't find tall, thin women appealing (I'm more attracted to females akin to Silverstone), but I have to admit that Uma completely owns the over-the-top role of Poison Ivy and is thoroughly alluring.Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as Mr. Freeze. Yes, every time he merely opens his mouth you know it's Schwarzenegger, but he's amusing and he has a great look and costume.The film has heart. Although Poison Ivy is truly ee-vil and gets her comeuppance, you can't help but sympathize with Freeze's love for his wife and desire to resurrect her. Batman is able to see under his icy veneer and see a warm heart that's willing to accept redemption and make restitution. Furthermore, as noted above, you really feel the love of Bruce and Alfred and the others at Wayne Manor.Lastly, the film is full of vibrant colors and goofy over-the-top thrills. It's just a fun movie, if you're in the mood for a half-serious/half-campfest superhero flick.I also like that Smashing Pumpkins song that plays over the end credits.The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes.GRADE: B+",Batman & Robin
31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Batman and Robin,2,10 June 2005,"This was the film that was infamously credited as the one which brought down the franchise started by Tim Burton. What started out as a dark vision became lighter in tone (filled in lot of painful one-liners) and brighter (more neon colours) in setting. The formula of showcasing the origins of the villains was stale, especially so since the delivery was outright flat.With the rumoured bust ups between Kilmer and Schumacher, it is no surprise that a new actor will occupy Wayne Manor. George Clooney became the new Batman, what with his square jaw and all, but unfortunately, he's no Bruce Wayne nor Batman - his star personality shone through the character, and he made little attempt to distinguish the difference between being the Bat and Bruce, so both sound the same. Also, the lame one liners like ""And this is why Superman works alone"" didn't cut it, this is the Dark Knight, not your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman! (Yeah, I'd blame it on the script). Real life joker as he is, get serious George! His ""Hi Freeze, I'm Batman"" with a wry smile destroyed the image Michael Keaton started, and which Val Kilmer carried forward with more angst.Arnold Schwarzenegger got worse one-liners (seemed like the script's only filled with them), and his Mr Freeze became comical. Mr Freeze is a sad character, one in which you might pity at times, given his condition and his cause to research and save his wife's life. But the script here mildly scratches the surface of this cool (pardon the pun) character. The sacrifice made by Schwarzenegger was a bald head to look like the character, but his muscles and build looked out of place (Freeze was always drawn as a scrawny man). But no matter, the effects of his freeze gun was pretty well done.We were introduced to a rushed origin of Poison Ivy (it's getting formulaic!), it probably makes little sense of what's happening. Not that Uma Thurman doesn't look the part, though I must confess, at times the costumes look too cheesy with gaudy colours. It's only when we see Uma in the classic leafy blouse and green stockings did Poison Ivy temporarily come alive. Her poisonous kiss was also dealt with without much depth. When you get kissed, you'll go into this psychedelic hypnotic trance, and you'll be under her spell. Here, this gets glossed over. We know both Batman and Robin fall under her spell and started to bicker (in a scene that I'll label outright as Stupid) but the trance like sequence was absent, where they will see the world in some plant like environment, with Ivy in various states of undress. Get my point?Batgirl was so wrongly done, just to get Clueless star Alicia Silverstone on board. Barbara Gordon is Commissioner Gordon's daughter, but given Jim Gordon's lack of substantial characterization in the entire franchise, Barbara becomes Alfred's niece. Totally off, and I wondered who in DC Comics approved of such a blasphemous change.The costume Chris O'Donnell wore, seriously looked like Nightwing. They could have titled this film Batman and Nightwing if Nightwing had a more popular and recognizable following. Heck, even the movie's logo, an amalgam of Batman's and Nightwing's (yes, not Robin's) looked cool, and I thought the plot included Dick's wanting for independence and leaving Robin behind to strike out on his own. No disrespect to Chris, but since Batman Forever, the movie's version of Dick Grayson always seemed more like Jason Todd (the fallen Robin who was murdered by the Joker), and this time it seemed a bit worse. However I was quite pleased to see that in the finale, Robin was outfitted in a costume that really looked like Nightwing's, and I actually hoped that if this bad movie did manage box office success, perhaps we might see a Nightwing spin-off. Alas.I don't mind, and could probably understand why, so many actors and characters were thrown into the mix. But the worse inclusion of all has got to be that of Bane. Bane is a relatively new character who was developed by the drug enhancer code-named ""Venom"" (You can read more about it in Legends of the Dark Knight 16-20, and Vengeance of Bane). He's also credited as the villain who broke Batman's back in Batman issue 497. This film totally humiliated Bane by making him a voiceless, useless lackey of Poison Ivy.As for the supporting characters, Alfred was inflicted with a fictional disease, so there goes ""reality"", out of the window. Commissioner Gordon, again played by Pat Hingle, wasn't given much screen time or character depth and I had already given up seeing the strong brotherhood between Bats and him that could have been. Elle ""The Body"" MacPherson starred as Judie Madison, the token love interest of Bruce Wayne, which could have been done away with given the zero chemistry. If I recall, the comic Bruce Wayne in the Bob Kane days was engaged to her (or was she called at that time, Julie Madison?)While the actors probably tried their best, I wonder what ran through their minds when they read the script, because it is one rigged with scenes which leapt right out of Adam West's TV Series. I mean, Bat-credit-card? And from nippled costumes (which still stayed) to butt-shots, what gives? The Batmobile was mutilated! It was a one-seater open air dragster that looked simply horrible. The worst of all the Batmobiles we've seen, aesthetically that is.This movie tanked, and rightfully so. It isn't the Batman that can fit into the franchise. It was totally off tangent. Fans around the world hated the Schumacher-treatment, and I'd bet he'll never touch another Bat/DC Comics franchise for many years to come.",Batman & Robin
32,Mr-Fusion,Man oh man . . .,2,30 September 2016,"It'd be easy to write off ""Batman & Robin"" as just a toy commercial. But honestly, there are merchandise-driven movies that are actually good. No, that's not the problem with this movie; its woes are much more serious.Clooney could've made a decent Batman in another movie, but he's pretty much just Clooney here. None of these characters are paid any actual mind; Freeze and Ivy aren't close to the mark at all (the less that can be said about Bane here, the better), while Batgirl is awkwardly shoehorned into the plot; the conflict between Batman and Robin is forced, as well as Alfred's illness. And none of this occurs organically; it's clumsy in every respect.If you take all of that and throw in the hysterical score, the overacting and awful dialogue, it's not hyperbole to call this the bottom of the barrel for superhero movies. It's loud, fetishistic and just plain uncomfortable. And there's serious money behind this. What the hell were they thinking? 2/10",Batman & Robin

34,ShadeGrenade,What is wrong with 'camp'?,8,2 March 2007,"One thing that strikes me from reading these reviews is that people have sadly forgotten how to appreciate 'camp'. Back in the '60's, camp was in vogue, thanks to the 'Batman' television series, as well as movies such as 'Our Man Flint/In Like Flint' and Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' series ( which began with 'The Silencers' ).What is camp? It is a ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness on the part of the main characters, so serious in fact that it becomes amusing.So, yes, 'Batman & Robin' is campy. And that's how I like the Caped Crusader. Taken seriously, I find him a bit of a bore. So many modern movies are 'dark' now that I have to take a flashlight every time I visit the local multiplex. 'B & R' was the third sequel to the 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster, which starred Michael Keaton. Both left the series at the same time. Their replacements were Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer. Schumacher retained the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Burton films, while bringing in some of the colourful campery of the '60's series. He was ripped to pieces for doing so but I think he was right. Kilmer was an adequate replacement. George Clooney donned the cowl and cape for 'B & R ', and was better than Kilmer, but Keaton was still far and away the best. Warner Bros.' 'Batman' franchise was bound to run out of puff, and did. All franchises run out of puff in the end. James Bond did with 'The Man With The Golden Gun' in 1974. The less said about 'Superman 4: The Quest For Peace' the better. But they both recovered. Ditto 'Batman'. 'Batman Begins' could never have been made were it not for 'B & R '. The plot concerns 'Mr.Freeze' who is trying to save his dying wife by freezing Gotham City...something like that. It is not important. People who go to 'Batman' in search of great plots are fools.Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast as 'Mr.Freeze' - the man cannot, and never could, act. Patrick Stewart should have gotten the role. Then there's Uma Thurman as 'Poison Ivy', a villain I'm not familiar with, but she was the best thing in the movie. Sexy, sassy and cool. This was how she should have been in 'The Avengers'. Alicia Silverstone as 'Batgirl'? Another mistake. 'Batgirl' is to 'Batman' what 'Scrappy Doo' is to 'Scooby Doo'. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as 'Robin', but like 'Batgirl', I never could stand the character.As soon as the title of this film was announced, I thought: ""Oh oh trouble!"". Its so crass. 'Batman Supreme' would have been better.So with all these strikes against it, why is 'B & R' so much fun? Simple. For those of us who fondly remember the '60's version, it works perfectly as a homage. If you ask me, they should have gone further by putting 'Pow!', 'Zap!' and 'Kerpow!' on the fights. Nothing in the movie makes sense, nor is it meant to. Just as reality makes no sense. Don't go to 'B & R' expecting Fellini, and you'll have a great time. The opening chase alone is worth purchasing the D.V.D. for. To all the doom mongers, I say this - lighten up! Watch 'B & R' and enjoy. We can get 'dark' and 'edgy' movies anywhere. 'Batman' is not 'Seven'!",Batman & Robin
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,I really can't believe Joel did this,2,19 September 2002,"Batman & Robin, the big summer movie of 1997, I remember seeing this in the theater when I was 12 and even then I wasn't impressed. But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about, but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity.Batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help; his niece, Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientist/right activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien, named Bang, he ""kills"" her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them I guess.Batman & Robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman, the Dark Knight, it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this, I really wish I could get past this, I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please, don't watch this film if you love Batman, or you'll be sorry.2/10",Batman & Robin
36,blanbrn,Worst film in the bat series it's dull and a drag.,4,12 July 2008,"""Batman and Robin"" clearly is forgettable as the magic and chemistry just didn't work on this film it's story just seemed like a drag and dull. Though I'm not saying that George Clooney is a bad actor yet he just seemed out of place as ""Batman"" as again the wearing of the cape and the man behind the mask changed. So their simply wasn't any chemistry in having a staying actor for this superhero. The plot centered around the possibility of Gotham being turned into a planet of freeze and ice from the villain Mr. Freeze(Arnold Schwarzenegger a role that seemed out of place for him)and Uma Thurman stars as ""Poison Ivy"" with her deadly plants. Now really the plot and quality of the villains has just fallen so low and it stayed to family orientated with the introduction of ""Batgirl""? I'm glad the ""Batman"" movies started to take a new direction and fresh start under Chris Nolan because this 1997 mess is highly forgettable and a mess.",Batman & Robin
37,MovieAddict2016,Could have been better...much better,1,20 August 2001,"NOTE (12/11/04): This was one of the first reviews I wrote on IMDb. Excuse the spelling mistakes and stupidity herein.====Wow! I never knew a trilogy of movies that were horrible compared to the original. I mean, Batman was great, Batman returns...too dark. Batman Forever(which I regrettably bought thinking it would be good((which is why I rent movies first now)) was okay...a little too dumb, and again dark. But Batman and Robin is a movie that you can truly pick out and say, ""That movie is a piece of crap."" Chris 'O Donnel, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, and even George Clooney acted hoorible in this film(although that's pretty normal...). Schwarzenegger was perfect as Freeze though, he brought the classic Batman character Victor Frieze to life, and added the cold chill to his voice, and am I the only one who thinks Uma Thurman is ugly??? When ""Batgirl"" drops in at the end and Clooney says something like, ""Who's this?"" and she replies, ""HE-HE, It's me Bruce, Barbara!"" I nearly screamed out in laughter. I mean all she has is this 2 inch long bat shaped mask. You can practically see her entire face. Chris 'O Donnell was once again loud mouthed and horrible actor, and I had to think what WAS with these stupid attempted one liners like, ""Chicks dig the car"", or George Clooney's, ""This is why superman works alone.."" the only ones I found funny were Arnold's, like ""Okay everyone, Freeze!"", and the way he spoke with intelligence. Overall I think the only part I liked was at the end... *SPOILERS AHEAD*.. When Freeze is put in the same jail cell with Poison Ivy, after he found out she tried to kill his wife(who is frozen in a test tube during the movie, because he's trying to find a cure for her disease), and he walks in and you just see his outline of blue, and see her scared expression(which is pretty fake looking). Then he says something fancy and starts laughing. And the only thing I liked about the ending was how you see Freeze, in a way had a righteous anger(in a way, though I'm not saying freezing a city justifies it), but it was righteous in a way, and in the end he gets to still work on his wife's disease cure at the jail, and he gives Clooney the cure for Alfred's disease. Too bad it was a bit corny the way Clooney acted talking to him about it all. Overall I give Batman and Robin 1 and a half/5 stars. PS Why call this movie Batman and Robin, instead of Batman and Freeze, or Batman and Batgirl, Because Robin was already introduced in Batman Forever, why didn't they call THAT one Batman and Robin?",Batman & Robin
38,Red-Barracuda,"Spectacularly misguided, yet sort of quite entertaining at the same time",5,25 July 2016,"This third follow-up to Tim Burton's ground-breaking Batman (1989) is a film whose reputation certainly goes before it. It was so misguided and terribly received that it effectively put paid to that particular franchise before it was later reinvented by Christopher Nolan with a decidedly more chin-strokingly serious approach. It feels like the film-makers thought that by this instalment the audience must want more of everything. To this end there are three super-villains plus a new heroine to add to the two title characters. And on that note, the fact that this movie is called Batman & Robin would imply that either both title characters are at the top of their game as a super-effective crime fighting duo or perhaps have interesting psychological demons to wrestle with resulting in some intense drama. In practise, they spend the whole movie squabbling over which one of them is fancied more by Poison Ivy. In this regard, Robin is a particularly irritating and whining half-wit. The script is terrible and that contributes a lot to this character being so moronic but Chris O'Donnell plays him like he is an odious and tiresome teenager, so much so that I have to give George Clooney's Batman some credit in not resorting to giving his cohort a clip around the ear for persistently and endlessly rabbiting on about how Uma Thurman's character liked him better than Batman. In truth, the dialogue in general is very, very bad in this movie throughout and no one really comes out of it unscathed. For instance the entire dialogue spouted by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Mr Freeze appeared to consist solely of ice-based puns. By the end of the film I was on the edge of my seat, excited by the hope that Arnie could potentially get to the end of the film without uttering a single sensible line of dialogue at any point. Needless to say, he maintained the ice-based idiocy right up until the finale which was a pretty impressive achievement in some respects.Tonally, Batman & Robin is a slight return to the comic approach of the 1966 original Batman: The Movie. Only, that 60's original is funny as hell and acted to perfection by its great cast, Batman & Robin, on the other hand, is a pretty witless movie on the whole. But it, nevertheless, does have a much more lightly comic approach, especially when compared to the dark Burton entries in the series. It has a reasonably good cast that are utilised quite poorly, none of whom totally escape the shrapnel of this exploding turd. Clooney's actually not too bad to be fair but he's in the wrong place at the wrong time, while Thurman's Poison Ivy is probably the best character in the film, although she too is made to look foolish at times with some of the lines she has to utter. Alicia Silverstone is pretty lifeless as Batgirl it has to be said although she's still better value than O'Donnell as the terminally annoying Robin. As I mentioned before, Schwarzenegger gets plus points from me for his relentless ice-based stupidity, which was entertainingly moronic and would no doubt make for the basis of a good drinking game. The look of Gotham City itself seems to have changed too from Burton's gloomy Gothic architecture, we now have streets and buildings made up of giant statues, I've no idea why but it does seem to be kind of a dumb idea. Despite, or perhaps because of all of the shortfalls in this one, I still found it kind of entertaining. There are so many characters and so much going on that it maintained its interest factor. It was essentially dumb fun for most of the time, and comic book in the stupidest sense. The main drawback, however, was that it clocked in at two hours which really was pushing its luck though; something this ridiculous should be ninety minutes and no more. All-in-all, I found this to be a pretty obviously bad movie that nevertheless entertained me for the most part. It's too interestingly poor to truly qualify as a terrible movie and because you know that there's always a good chance that Arnie could pitch up any second with yet another ice-based pun you realise that it can't be all bad.",Batman & Robin
39,Rainey-Dawn,Not All That Bad,7,8 September 2021,"I think this film is better than the 3.8 IMDb rating - this is undeserving in my opinion. The movie isn't perfect by any means but it is better than the rating. Overall, the film is quite fun to watch - I only have a couple of pet peeves with it.Pet Peeves: 1) Batgirl. I hate the way she comes in and steals Robin's bike and goes out after lying to her uncle Alfred that she's going to bed. She is NOT a role-model while bashing Poison Ivy for not being a good role-model. Batgirl please!! I also didn't like how she knew how to work all of the bat equipment without proper training. That is bull. 2) Batnipples and batbutts - come on that is so dumb!! 3) Colours to bright on the screen at times. 4) Too cartoony at times.What I like: 1) Fun story and film. 2) The retro feel at times - sometimes it's almost like watching Adam West and Burt Ward - I dig that. 3) It feels like watching a live action comic - love the comic book feel.7/10.",Batman & Robin
40,disdressed12,campy but funny at times.probably won't leave much of an impact after watching though,6,21 July 2007,"i suppose you could say this movie is the low point in the franchise.i mean,while watching the movie i kept thinking it was basically a two hour movie of the 1960's camp classic classic with Adam west and Burt Ward.i found it hard to take the movie very seriously,considering there were so many one liners,most of them corny,but some quite funny.also the movie was very special effects laden,to say the least.the characters all seemed to be just parodies of themselves.George Clooney Donned the cape for this incarnation,and i have to agree with another reviewer who said he seemed to be playing George Clooney.i don't think he had quit the right look for Batman,but then again,neither did the movie.there were some good things about the movie.Uma Thurman was one,in the role of villainess Poison Ivy.she looked great and i loved her accent.i found it strangely seductive.Alicia Silverstone Played BatGirl.she looked good in her skintight outfit.she's cute too.Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin,and once again,i really loved the look of his suit at the beginning,not so much the one he had later in the film.i didn't like Batman's costume too much at all.i thought it just looked silly.oh,yeah,Arnie was in this one and received top billing as the evil genius Mr Freeze.basically he just fired his gun at everything and everyone and froze whatever was in his way.they even imagined to make arkham asylum look non foreboding. this whole new look Batman may have been the point to the movie.maybe it was all deliberate,but i think if that's the case,the experiment backfired.people hated this movie.i didn't hate it.i found it entertaining but very light as far as Batman goes.guess i would give it a 6/10 just for entertainment value.",Batman & Robin
41,KineticSeoul,I thought this movie was crap even when I was a kid,3,11 July 2012,"Wow this movie is like the epitome of a very commercial superhero movie. It's not a shock this is known as probably one of the worst superhero movie ever made. Seriously anyone could have made this movie if they had the right budget. The dialogue in this is laughably awful, except it wasn't suppose to be funny. The past Batman movies lacked the essence of a Batman movie but this goes so far away from the source material. Wow they really put the final nail on the coffin for this one after slamming it shut. George Clooney just isn't Bruce Wayne and the villains in this was just plain comical and there is nothing intimidating about them. Even if they look like they are on steroids. Watching this movie was like watching bunch of characters at a theme part except your not part of it. If you think ""Batman Forever"" is super corny and has some awful dialogue you haven't seen nothing yet. This movie takes that too a whole new level, as corny as this movie is it's dialogue is laughably bad. You can get a few movie buddies together and bash the crap out of this one and at least get some entertainment out of it. George Clooney is Batman and Bruce Wayne this time and well he is no Batman or Bruce Wayne. He isn't a bad actor but he was just not right for the role of Batman or Bruce Wayne, far from it in fact. I even heard George Clooney publicly apologized for this movie, which isn't all that shocking. Val Kilmer made a very smart move not signing up for the sequel. Also besides the dialogue the acting in this is also laughably bad, it's just way too forced and over the top. Chris O'Donnell is Robin again and that character portrayed in this is even more silly and wack. Mr. Freeze is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, as corny as he is in this with some super cheesy one-liners he was sort of entertaining to watch. But lacked the demeanor and characteristics of Mr. Freeze in the comics. And he looks more like Cyborg from the DC universe than Mr. Freeze. They also got Poison Ivy and Bane totally wrong. Yeah Bane is suppose to be a big bulk guy. But the makers of this flick though if your a macho tough guy you must be dumb if your the villain kinda deal. Lot of the characters origins are just totally off as well. They just put way too many villains in this movie for actual decent development. More doesn't always equal better. Also where do these villains get there goons from? In the past Batman movies the villain's goons are silly but this one is just flat out goofy than all the past Batman goons combined in movies. Well almost. And on the Batman's side they even get a new recruit Batgirl. Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone) is just so forced into this flick, even if Alicia Silverstone is barely passable as Batgirl. And Batgirl's uncle is Alfred in this movie...WTH!? So even if she is a bit of a eye candy her character takes away from this movie. The direction of it all just didn't make it work, plus the whole package is just downright atrocious with it's super cartoony style. Actually even Saturday morning cartoons are less corny and silly than this. This movie is failure and success since it fails as a movie but was somewhat successful at box office. There was Bat suit with nipples on it in ""Batman Forever"" but this one is the one that is infamous for it's Bat suit nipples. Also has a lot Bat/Robin butt sequences as well. Overall if you and a couple of movie buddies decide to watch and bash on this movie it might be a good time somewhat but besides that it's better to avoid this. It just tarnishes the Batman franchise. Tim Burton started these series of movies with ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" and Joel Schumacher really really ended it.3/10",Batman & Robin
42,OllieSuave-007,Stoic Batman.,6,14 June 2007,"While a somewhat fun, popcorn film, this Batman movie ranks as probably one of the worsts. Here, we have George Clooney starring as Batman, giving us what I think is the worst Batman performance; Clooney was mediocre and bland, and didn't looked like he wasn't interested in the role. Chris O'Donnell continued his role as Robin, who seemed to be living in the shadows of Batman. Batman and Robin are supposed to be partners in crime, but that partnership and teamwork are, unfortunately, not depicted here and made the film title redundant. A little more effort of teamwork here would have improved this film at least four times as much.Arnold Schwarznegger as Mr. Freeze was, I think, an OK fit for him, considering he played other buff, tough guys like Conin the Barbarian and the Terminator. His costume was OK, but his lines were campy. He is one villain the audience would have sympathy for. This main intention is to save his frozen wife, and does have feelings unlike the other psychotic Batman villains of the past. Uma Thurman gave a devious, yet humorous performance as Poison Ivy. Her costumes were great and has the crafty female charm as Catwoman. Also, Alicia Silverstone gave a teenage-pop performance as Batgirl. Her performance wasn't bad, and probably had a bit of a rapport to Batman and Robin than the two had with each other. Her fight sequence between Poison Ivy was short, though. Once again, Joel Schumacher turned this film's setting like a colorful comic, imitating Batman Forever. He basically treated this movie like a cartoon fest, with off-the-wall action scenes. In addition, though, Elliot Goldenthal's music score was good. If you like campy fun, this film is for you. If you're a true fan of the comics, then stay away from this film. Grade C+",Batman & Robin
43,thesar-2,Freeze! Don't Watch This,1,1 December 2012,"Number one flaw – the previous Batman flick should've been called Batman & Robin and this one Forever as a nice send off until the definite Batman movies came to be thanks to Christopher Nolen. That's such a small flaw compared to every other horrid thing wrong with this Batman 60's TV show revamp. If I heard Arnold screech ""Everyone chill"" or other dozen lines he repeats throughout more than more a dozen times, I would purposely move to California to vote against him (side note: seeing how they're faring with his leadership and economy, I don't have to move a muscle; people will certainly vote him out next time.) Nothing worked in this film if you're over five, maybe six years old. The only thing this camp could've improved on, was allowing 109-year-old Alfred finally kick the bucket, but alas, he survives right alongside Batman who showed his ""human"" side throughout since he couldn't solve any problem without consulting first with Batgirl and Robin.

44,FeastMode,my notes,1,25 June 2019,"Wins my award for worst movie of all time. literally everything about this movie was terrible. There is not one redeeming quality. George Clooney is a horrible choice for Batman. Arnold as freeze only made me laugh.

45,Lejink,Bat's all folks...,3,16 August 2011,"Can't remember seeing a lower average score on this site and I'm not going to help it much either. This really is a day-glo disaster with all the lights on and nobody home. The sets this time look ridiculous, I mean an observatory kitted out like a giant showroom dummy, Robin's costume isn't Robin's, Batgirl's introduction proves that three is a crowd while Clooney's Batman seems like an extra in the film bearing his name.With almost every special effect you can see the C-Gen join - the only one I liked was Mr Freeze's ice gun. Which leads on to the two, three if you count the gormless Bane, mismatched villains. The biggest example of the Emperor's New Clothes in the whole of Hollywood's history, Arnold Schwarzenneggar, somehow gets top-billing here and gives his usual one-note performance only this time unfortunately it's the note of high C as he's given licence to go over the top of over the top. Uma Therman's Poison Ivy trades pantomime-style delivery clichés with the same irritating regularity as old Arnie and frankly not much in the way of sexuality.Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone fight a draw in their battle to be the more irritating while George Clooney is a complete sell-out, barely engaging with his character at all. The stunts and staged set pieces come thin and fast and before you know it there's a happy ending, with old ailing Alfred back as good as new and the very real threat of a sequel involving Batgirl and Robin again.Thankfully poor box-office returns nixed that idea and it took Christopher Nolan's blacker vision to get this franchise back on track. It sure was a long way up from this fiasco however, which might just have entertained me at age 8, but today just misses its mark completely demonstrating just how wrong you can go in Sequel City.",Batman & Robin
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A pretty awful experience, but about a step from being the worst Batman movie",4,2 July 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Gotham City is in the grip of a new enemy: Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). A former noble scientist thrown into despair when his wife starts dying, an accident in a science lab has turned him into a super-villain intent on turning the city into a massive block of ice. But he's about to find a new ally in the shape of the beautiful, sexy Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), also a former scientist killed after discovering a secret she wasn't supposed to. Her plan is simply to callously illiminate man-kind so her floral kindred can make the world theirs. Of course, the caped crusader and his side-kick must stop this, but as Robin struggles to mature to find the strength and restraint to be Batman's ally, can the two work together in time to make an effective partnership against evil...Easily the most critically mauled movie of the Batman franchise, the final part in the old series is again directed by hack director Joel Schumacher and continues with the awful Forever's lighter, more family-friendly turn. And it's dogged by the same problems the last film had: the story is lame, the dialogue clunky and poorly delivered and basically having the feel of a loud, garish, overly-colourful nightmare production. But, in my personal opinion, I would say it is just a step away from being the worst movie of the franchise.There is at least an engaging sub-plot to this one concerning Alfred, his deterioration into illness and the arrival of his grand-daughter (Alicia Silverstone), unlike the last one which was just a non-stop assault of loud, colourful, vacuous nothingness.It's also helped (very mildly!) by some fairly good performances. George Clooney has a genuine presence as Batman (I'd pick him over Kilmer, that's for sure!) and Thurman has a genuinely sexy presence to her as Poison Ivy (appearing in some figure hugging sexy suits and pouts that certainly raise the temperature a degree for a PG movie!) as well as giving a good turn as a nasty, well-spoken bitch with a genuine contempt for humanity. As for Schwarzenegger, he looks cool (forgive the pun!) in his Mr Freeze costume, but he's really at his bad-acting worst in terms of his performance here. Chris O'Donnell is as hopeless as ever and thankfully faded into oblivion shortly after this movie was made. The same fate, it would appear though, fell to Silverstone, who didn't deserve it as much, but her role as Bat-Girl here is pretty pointless and a rather tacky marketing gimmick aimed at keeping the franchise going longer (which failed.) Overall, I can kind of see where the detractors are coming from with all their criticisms of the movie. Like Schumacher's previous effort, it's a loud, colourful, pretty vacuous experience, just not as much so as the last one. You could at least see it on a 'so-bad-it's-good' value just to try and make your own mind up. **",Batman & Robin
47,ElMaruecan82,"So bad it actually redeems ""Batman Forever""...",4,11 August 2017,"Joel Schumacher 1997 ""Batman & Robin"" wasn't just a critical disaster; it was an unprecedented failure in the history of the superhero franchise. It was the only ""Batman"" not to be nominated for any Oscar, not even the ""technical"" ones, the only film not to be the highest-grossing summer block-buster; in fact, it didn't even make it to the yearly Top 10. Worse, it cumulated more Razzie nominations than the others did with the Oscars. And finally, the film is often cited among the Worst Movies Ever Made. That's how damaging to the franchise Schumacher was.Now, why shooting someone who's already down? Especially since everything has been said about the film, even Clooney admitted they had killed the franchise and Schumacher apologized for it. Well, I think the film can work as a school-case of all the ""Don't!"" when it comes to directing a superhero movie and had the merit to show that the success of ""Batman & Robin"" wasn't to be taken for granted. Still, how could they really mess that up? If there's anything the success of the three previous opuses proved is that you can have campy villains, a superficial approach to Bruce Wayne's past and get away with it. Obviously, Schumacher couldn't, despite the special effects, the publicity and Schwarzenegger in his first villainous role since ""The Terminator"". He even got the top-billing above Clooney, like Nicholson over Keaton.But the film sure doesn't play in the same league than Tim Burton's ""Batman"", it doesn't even compete with Schumacher ""Batman Forever"". In ""Batman & Robin"", the director seems intoxicated by his budget so much that instead of delivering a film, he makes a never-ending toys' commercial astir with video-game extravaganza shots. ""Batman Forever"" had a few sequences you could label as 'feast for the eyes' and some more introspective moments, not to mention Nicole Kidman, but ""Batman & Robin"" is a Technicolor orgy full of prop-using and action-sequences and so many new additions to the series it accentuates the feeling of being in a noisy, overcrowded place: besides Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman plays the sexy Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone is Alfred's niece from England (as evidenced by her uniform, and not her accent).We had just gotten used to Robin's presence and he's already acting (or overacting) like the angry teenager, but just when you expect his relationship with Wayne to improve, the girl makes her entrance and before you know it, she's the new Batgirl. The Wayne Mansion has turned into a foster home, with Clooney reduced to  a chin, and a few deadpan expressions that hardly betray the ""what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here?"" feeling. At least Arnie seemed to have fun playing Mr. Freeze and it showed. Say what you want, he's not the worst thing about the movie. Arnie plays a memorable villain who's just victim of a script where the writer listed all the possible puns with the word 'cold', 'ice', 'cool' and 'heat' and threw them away in.And let me say something, the more I see Akiva Goldsman's films, the more I believe this guy is a talentless hack. ""A Time to Kill"" was a manipulative and reversely racist movie, half of ""A Beautiful Mind"" was reliant on thriller stuff that didn't say anything about Nash (as if a movie about a math genius needed to be like James Bond) and finally, ""Batman & Robin"". Had the script been a little less ""dense"" and silly, it might have enhanced Mr. Freeze's status as a passable villain, Arnie is not a bad actor, and at least, he was in the role. Uma Thurman did what she could with what was at hands, but Goldsman is no Tarantino. I didn't like her performance, but to her defense, how was a girl like Poison ivy supposed to behave or talk? At least Michelle Pfeiffer had the uniform; it made half the woman she was. But Thurman looked like a sort of exotic queen from a B-adventure picture, so how was she supposed to talk? With a regal accent? A femme fatale?I don't even think anyone cared, it seems like each character provided a chromatic texture, Ivy was the green, Freeze the blue and all Gotham in reddish light. But in classy black, there's still good old Michael Gough, saving the film from being a total disaster. His interactions with Clooney allows the ""ER"" alumni to prove that he's an actor working below his level, and together they contribute to some of the most genuinely powerful moments. The way they ""break the ice"" (no pun intended) and exchange a few tender words could have worked even better if they didn't inflict him the same disease than Freeze's wife, as if dying of old age was too risky a move. I guess they were afraid to kill Alfred, but there was no way this film would have been part of Batman's canon, they would have killed Robin as well or made Batman marry someone, it wouldn't have made things worse (and by the way, what did the romance with Elle MacPherson ever added to the film?)This is the film fans pretend it didn't exist, the film ends like ""Batman Forever"" with three instead of two heroes running away from the Bat-signal but we all know the film closed the eight-year of the first Batman period, and it would take eight more years to digest them before a guy named Nolan would give perhaps the approach the series needed, with less gadgets and more substance. I say 'perhaps' because I still have to watch his films, but I had to check the first ones first. I don't think it can sink as low as ""Batman & Robin"" but what would that say, if there is a merit for ""Batman & Robin"" is that it made ""Batman Forever"" look not so bad in comparison.",Batman & Robin
48,richardchatten,"An Absurd Waste of Money, But a Masterpiece Compared to 'Catwoman'",5,30 June 2016,"Interestingly enough the venerable Leonard Maltin gave 'Batman & Robin' a higher rating (two and a half stars) in his Movie Guide than 'Batman Returns' (two stars), which over the years has probably caused plenty of outrage in some quarters; but with which I happily concur. As a fan of the TV series I never thought Tim Burton's Batman movies were that great to begin with - and anyone who says 'Batman & Robin' is the worst movie ever made should be forced to watch 'Catwoman' - so I'd like to say a few words in support of this deliriously Big Dumb Movie.Yeah, I know, the Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan movies are ""DARK""!! Big Deal...! They certainly take themselves very seriously; but this isn't exactly Eugene O'Neill we're talking about. Sure, Joel Schumacher couldn't make a decent movie if his life depended upon it; but at least the money is all up there on the screen (it certainly looks as if it cost the $125 million Warner Bros. squandered on it). It contains a touching swansong from Michael Gough's Alfred (who's late sister Peg in an old photograph is actually Gloria Stuart, who played Old Rose in the same year's 'Titanic'), has a cool score by Elliot Goldenthal and swish special effects; and it's refreshing to see a recent Hollywood movie that actually looks as if it was shot in Technicolor rather than just various shades of brown and beige.And it has Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy.Along with Jim Carrey's Riddler, Thurman's Poison Ivy is one of the two best villains in the entire eighties & nineties franchise: every bit the supple, purring jezebel that Michelle Pfeiffer's whining crybaby of a Catwoman should have been but wasn't. Elliot Goldenthal's smooth saxophone theme further heightens her sinuous impact, while her sleek green one-piece (happily without nipples) actually improves upon all the previous versions; making her the only female character since Lee Meriwether's Catwoman to wear a costume slinkier and sexier on the big screen than she did in the comic strip.There are just two snags; and in keeping with the gargantuan nature of this epic folly they're big ones. The first - Schwarzenegger being the bigger star - is that Poison Ivy gets only a fraction of the screen time devoted to his boring Mr Freeze. The other snag - surprise surprise - is Schumacher again.Schumacher is openly gay and likes the rest of us to know all about it. But whereas gay directors like Pedro Almodóvar and François Ozon regularly populate their films with strong and glamorous women, in 'Batman & Robin' we instead get nipples and codpieces adorning the Dynamic Duo in tandem with a lack of interest on the director's part in Thurman's thrilling little minx that amounts to negligence. (Schumacher shoots enormous close-ups of the Bat-Trio's butts as they get dressed for action but repeatedly passes up opportunities to show us Poison Ivy from behind. Note the way that she sweeps in to meet Schwarzenegger in one scene with the camera tracking along behind her as she walks the length of the room photographed full-length from behind AND SHE'S WEARING A FUR COAT DOWN TO HER ANKLES; which she promptly casts off, never to wear it again! And later she places her boot on the bottom rung of a ladder and on the very frame that she starts to turn away from the camera to begin climbing SCHUMACHER CUTS!!)But enough survives from the detritus to make this a far better way to waste a couple of hours than other overproduced dreck like 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor'.",Batman & Robin
49,Cineanalyst,Pun for the Whole Family,5,16 December 2020,"""Batman & Robin"" seems to leave many cold, but there's something that warms my heart about a trashy flick based around puns. Two of the best worst movies in this respect are born of the Batman franchise: this and ""Catwoman"" (2004). Approach them seriously at your peril, but there's reveling to be had in their utter ridiculousness, poor taste and silly turn of phrase. Moreover, none other than Alfred Hitchcock claimed that ""puns are the highest form of literature."" ""Batman & Robin"" isn't the highest form of anything, but the paronomasia does provide levity to what would otherwise be a wretched affair--perhaps, making a bad movie so bad that it's... well, not good, still, but better than it would otherwise be.I prefer this to a bad movie that simply wastes its potential, such as Joel Schumacher's prior ""Batman Forever"" (1995). His cartoonish and colorful family-oriented retooling of the series in the wake of Tim Burton's darkly grotesque and sexualized ""Batman Returns"" (1992) was an abomination. The true riddle was whether one was supposed to take it seriously as a continuation on the theme of duality from Burton's films or as a bad joke. And I'll gladly take puns over the giggling mania of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey's Looney Tune villains, or of Jack Nicholson's unhinged Joker, for that matter. Furthermore, repartee was also part of the foundation of ""Batman Returns,"" as well as many other action and superhero movies. Catwoman hardly spoke a line that wasn't a double entendre. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy surely gets some sexually-charged wordplay off in this one, too, what with her ""wild oats to sow,"" and her garden that ""needs tending,"" and such. ""I'll help you grab your rocks,"" in response to Mr. Freeze's need for his diamond fuel, is my favorite.Undoubtedly, however, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Freeze is the hero of puns here. Seemingly almost everything he utters and half of what others remark regarding him involves some reference to something to do with being cold, cool and freezing or of ice, snow and winter--or the reverse as a sick burn. Some require a bit of set-up, such as the ice age killing the dinosaurs bit, but others, including ""Let's kick some ice,"" work best if very little thought is given to them at all. This is what makes such stupid scenes as Batman and Robin fighting via ice hockey work--to the extent that they work on any level of amusement at all. Not everything fits neatly with the absurdities, though, especially the subplot of Alfred's sickness and Freeze missing his wife, as well as Bruce Wayne's perfunctory dating life. But, most of the film involves scenes such as Batman and Robin surfing while falling from the sky; a pointless motorcycle race full of continuous ""woo-hoos"" and ""yee-haws;"" Bane being reduced to wearing a gimp mask and driving Miss Ivy around; a bat-credit card; Schumacher's continued insistence on photographing rubber nipples, butts and codpieces; the usual unexplained hordes of minions that the supervillains somehow attract; Freeze's various freezing weapons; and the persistent and super-convenient bat-gizmos seemingly always tailor made for whatever supervillain Batman and company happen to be battling that episode (I mean, why would they have ice skates in their footwear and so many heating pads ready before they ever even heard of Mr. Freeze?). It's the icing on the bat-cake of puns.",Batman & Robin
50,g-bodyl,Not as good as the first three,6,7 December 2007,"This film was not as good as the first three films. It could've been better, but it was not all that bad. Joel Shumacher returns as director for the fourth sequel of the Batman series. There are some surprising actors in this film. George Clooney takes on the role of Batman while Arnold Schwarznegger takes the role of Batman's nemesis, Dr. Freeze. Freeze wants to ice the city up and he gets some help along the way in the form of Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman). The acting was not terrible, but in some ways it could've been better. The score was not as strong as the first couple films. The script was alright, but the plot line was the best about the film. I also like the costumes that were used in the film. They were very unique. Die-hard fans of Batman will be disappointed at this movie. But, I liked it a little. I rate this movie a 7/10.",Batman & Robin
51,Irishchatter,Loved Poison Ivy but hated the rest....,2,6 September 2015,"I found this film quite poorly done with its casting and storyline hiccups.I would've rather if Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Mr Freeze wasn't called that, it would have been better if he was called Iceman. The name honestly sounds so childish even kids would think so! I didn't mind the accent but the costume looked as if he was a robot not an Ice villain. I think a better costume would make him more himself really.Now for Bane, honest to god, why the hell was he so bloody stupid in this film? Jesus like, he was meant to be a mindful villain like he was on the Dark Knight Rises, not a dumb idiot! I honestly don't know why they casted George Clooney in this either. He honestly didn't look the part of being Bruce Wayne nor Batman. He was rather clueless like I thought he was always the best actor out there but I was wrong. At least there is two movies so far that he disappointed me! I didn't mind Alicia Silverstone in this but I think she was a bit too girly to be batgirl to be honest. She is pretty but she just didn't have that charisma of being Batgirl like. I would think someone who is more womanly and stronger would do the trick on playing Batgirl. The only outstanding character I loved in this was Uma Thurman playing Poison Ivy. She really had it all. The sexiness and how she made the character come to life! I think she deserved more Oscars on this then the rest of them. She was incredible!",Batman & Robin
52,CuriosityKilledShawn,Rancid,1,21 November 2000,"Oh Mother Nature, why was this garbage made? Why on Earth was such a blasphemous travesty unleashed upon the world? This film is a foul weed deep in the bowels of Satan. I would rather walk off a cliff than watch this total, total Spam again. Tim Burton's Gothic style from the first 2 films was great but here Joel Schumacher replaces that with bright, happy colors and many, many multicoloured dancing lights. Why? It's looks so stupid and so camp. So much so that it makes the original series look Butch. George Clooney is terrible. Chris O'Donnell is even worse. Alicia Silverstone is there for no reason other than to make guys see it. Arnie is bad, bad, bad. Uma Thurman is some sort of plantI dunno. The jokes are brazenly awful. And Bruce Wayne isnormal. Batman is not the weirdo he once was. Why doesn't he just become Barman instead? In BATMAN RETURNS he completely ignored Selina Kyle the first time he met her, despite the fact that she was smitten by him. But in this movie he's like 'Hi I'm Batman, I have unlimited credit on my Credit Batcard. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever watch this ugly, ugly and twisted pile of trash.",Batman & Robin

54,851222,"Worst Batman movie ever (thank to this, the best Superhero movie trilogy later was born)",2,1 March 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Batman & Robin"" (1997) is definitely the worst Batman movie ever. Nothing works in this train wreck from start till finish. It's very poorly acted by almost everyone involved, but that's because of a very bad script and even worse directing. There are some scenes that you simply can't believe you are watching a big budget movie with serious actors. The whole picture is so overproduced - there are many action and things going on in almost every scene that you start loosing interest and focus nearly 15 min. after the movie starts. Overall, there isn't much to say about this piece of garbage that wasn't said before. It's bad beyond ""it's so bad that it's fun"". No, it's not fun at all. Avoid this movie at all cost. It's hard to think that movie like ""Batman & Robin"" were created in the same world where later the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy was born. ""Batman & Robin"" is so bad that even creators and some actors publicly confirmed this fact. There is only one good aspect regarding this movie - if they wouldn't fail so hard with this picture, maybe there wouldn't be a need to reboot the franchise. In this case, later we would have lost the best Superhero trilogy of all time.",Batman & Robin
55,Bored_Dragon,The Worst Batman to Date,5,31 October 2017,"This movie has comic-book charm and, although it is not good, it's not as bad as ratings show. But as Batman adaptation it is complete disaster. It may seem like parody, but that wouldn't save it cause it's not funny at all. Although it is somewhat entertaining and watchable, this movie is the worst Batman of 90's and possibly the worst ever. I have nothing against Clooney, but he is really wrong choice to play Batman. I can not decide if he's worse as Bruce or as Batman. But, however unbelievable it may sound, Clooney as Batman is not the worst choice in this movie, because Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is incomparably worse. In stupid outfit, he badly plays character that is written even worse. He is not especially good actor anyway, but this is horrible even for him. This is abomination you have to see to believe. Robin and Batgirl are lousy, more part of the scenery than part of the story. Only Uma Thurman is somewhat decent, although far below her usual level. She overacts all the time, and although it is probably on purpose it simply ends up stupid. I'm not sorry that I saw this movie, but I definitely do not recommend it.5/10",Batman & Robin
56,ironhorse_iv,Batman & Robin is box office poison ivy. It's not even cool as ice. It's Bat Sh*t crazy!,2,9 December 2014,"Allow me to break the ice. This movie directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman is bad. Inspired by the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang, Batman and Robin nearly killed the Batman movie franchise forever with its cheese. Thank God, for director Christopher Nolan for rebooting it, years later, with a more gritty and realistic approach. Based on the DC Comics, it's the fourth and final film of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series, and second Batman film for director Schumacher after directing 1995, 'Batman Forever'. Batman & Robin tells the story of the Dynamic Duo, Batman (George Clooney) & Robin (Chris O'Donnell) as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. This is also the film debut of the appearance of Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). There are so many over the top unrealistic child friendly gimmicky action that really kills the film. Batman playing hockey against Mr. Freeze's henchmen. Lame. The movie has little to no logic, it's full of gaping plot-holes, continues errors, and others. You really have to suspension your disbelief for this film. I hate the whole vaguely-defined McGregor's Syndrome plot device McGuffin, it was a weak plot device. George Clooney felt like he was just phoning it in, as Batman. He has the charm, but he doesn't have the build to don the mask and cape. I miss the previous batman, Val Kilmer. Kilmer decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts. It's sad, because Val Kilmer made a better Batman than Clooney. Too bad, Tim Burton's Batman, Michael Keaton couldn't come back as well. Also, what happen to Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), Batman's love interest from Batman Forever? She's nowhere to be seen or mentioned. Julie Madison (Elle Macpherson), Bruce's steady girlfriend in the film, was originally scripted to have a more prominent role, but was cut. Honestly, she wasn't needed. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks out of place as Mr. Freeze. It really hard to believe that a bodybuilder scientist could be taken down. I guess, it's possible because Mr. Freeze, despite being armed and fully powered, is just lazy when it comes to killing people. I didn't mind, the thick Austrian accent, but Arnold doing ice puns, was too much. One thing, I like about this Mr. Freeze is that portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ""Heart of Ice"", written by Paul Dini. Chris O'Donnell reprises the role of Robin, and he's just as annoying and whinny as ever. I really can't stand him. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy was alright. Like Mr. Freeze, her puns and over acting ruin it. I liked the femme fatale characterization of the character, but the film ruin that for me with her lame origin story. Pamela Isley is ""ugly"" before becoming Poison Ivy because she has glasses, a ponytail and frumpy clothes? What? Stupid Hollywood. They also lost a great opportunity to team her up with co-criminal, Harley Quinn. Lost chance. The only reason this movie seems to be rated PG-13 instead of PG is because of Poison Ivy's endless and blatant sexual innuendo. Still, I kinda like it. One of the biggest complains about this Poison Ivy is Bane (Robert Swenson), as her mindless henchmen. This Bane is a complete and utter joke. Bane here is closer to a character from the comics named Ivan, later known as Ivor. Why couldn't they use Ivor, instead? Bane is supposed to be cerebral well train terrorist who uses his intellect, as much as his venom augmented brawn to torment the caped crusader in the comic world. We would later see this come to life, in 2012's Dark Knight Rises. Another insult is that of Barbara, who goes from being the daughter of Commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle) to the niece of Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough). Instead of the great 1988's Batman comic storyline: The Killing Joke, where Joker's bullet to the spine paralyzed her. We get a mindless tom-girl who loves to win dangerous motorcycles races for Alfred, despite having all the money gather up for his health care treatment. Don't get me wrong, I love the mindless race scene, but it wasn't needed. I also found it funny that Alicia doesn't even bother trying to sport an English accent. I like how Alfred know, that Barbara wants to be Batgirl with little to no reason. It doesn't make any sense. Why would he think Batman would be cool with it, when he already having problems with Robin? Batgirl's presence in the film, besides merchandising, was because they needed somebody to actually fight Poison Ivy, because you can't have males beating on a female in a family-friendly live action. I do find that some critics were a little harsh on Alicia Silverstone's weight as I saw nothing in the film, that make me think she's too heavyset for the role. This movie has way too much supporting characters, anyways. I like the throw away cameo from Jesse Ventura as Arkham Asylum Guard. I didn't mind all the possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. After all, it's Batman & Robin. Still, I question the random amount of close ups on body parts. There were some good things about the film. The best thing that came out from this movie is the music by Elliot Goldenthal, even if it's recycled from the previous film. I love ""The End Is the Beginning Is the End"" by The Smashing Pumpkins. Another thing, the film did well was production and costume design. I really like all the over the top landmarks. It gave a comic book feel to the film. Overall: Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin, but still watchable. It's so bad, it's good.",Batman & Robin
57,The-Sarkologist,An Abomination,2,22 November 2019,"The thing that I noticed the most watching this film for the second time ever, and straight after watching the previous one, was the huge number of similarities between the two. In a way it felt as if they had simply used the same script from Batman Forever, and just changed things around a bit. Like, instead of Two-Face, they had Doctor Freeze, and instead of The Riddler, they had Poison Ivy. In fact, the way they introduced Dr Freeze's backstory was the same way that they had introduced Two-Face's, namely by watching a video in the Bat-Cave.
As for Poison Ivy, well, their origin story was almost exactly the same, both her and the Riddler were scientists working for Wayne Enterprises, and both of them approach Bruce Wayne with a proposition, which is rejected, and then they both decide to become bad guys and seek revenge against him. Honestly, it really seemed as if the script-writers had seriously put absolutely no thought into this one.Oh, and Bane, a friend of mine made a comment as to how bad Bane was in this film, and I didn't even realise that he made an appearance. Mind you, after seeing the brilliant rendition of him in Dark Knight Rises, coming to this film and seeing how he was portrayed, I agree that he was an absolute abomination of a character, and it really puts this film to shame. No wonder Nolan decided to go back and actually do Bane properly in his film.Yeah, this film was absolutely appalling, and in fact it was also incredibly painful to watch at times, namely because it was so bad. There just really wasn't any originality in this whatsoever. Sure, in the previous film they introduced Robin, and now if felt that they had to introduce a third person to the team in this film - Bat-Girl. Yeah, that was really just going a little too far, especially with the fact that Bruce Wayne is seriously a loner. In a way, it just doesn't work with the character to suddenly team up with two others, especially with all of the problems that he has handling Robin.In the end, I'm glad that they decided to end it with this film, and then reboot it with Nolan's brilliant works of art, however, it has literally got to the point that this film was so bad (and I didn't even realise how bad it was until I watched it again) that I decided to pass on Batman Begins, until a friend really encouraged me to watch it. Yeah, my recommendation is just to simply let this one pass because honestly, it isn't worth it.",Batman & Robin

59,slightlymad22,Has Grew On Me Over Time,6,21 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch ever movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography in order, I come to Batman & Robin. Plot In A Paragraph: Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) try to keep their relationship together as they must stop Mr. Freeze (Arnie) from freezing Gotham City.Where to start with this one!! When I went to the cinema back in 1997, I could have walked out 20 minutes in. But as with Jingle All The Way, over time, both of my kids have really liked this one, so I have seen it a lot, and (because my kids enjoyed it so much) it has kind of grew on me in a weird sort of way. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's good, far from it. The puns are awful, the acting dire, the dialogue pathetic and the main plot is ridiculous. But I still don't hate it. A top billed Arnie is clearly having fun going totally over the top, his are the only puns I don't mind, and I find the subplot with Alfred dying to be quite touching. George Clooney is a good Bruce Wayne (although playing a handsome, rich playboy is not a stretch of his acting abilities as he is George Clooney for goodness sake) his Batman is poor though. I used to have a massive crush on Alicia Silverstone at the time this came out, and I remember all the hate she was getting for putting on weight during the production. Although she wasn't good in the movie, she didn't deserve the hate thrown her way, as she is no worse than O Donnell or several others in this movie. Elliot Goldenthal's score is good and is one of the best things about this movie. This was a sad end to a franchise I had enjoyed, especially Tim Burtons first two movies. As with Junior and Eraser, Arnie barely mentions Batman & Robin in his autobiography Total Recall. He does talk about how claustrophobic he got during the procedure of getting a cast of his head made.Batman & Robin was the 12th highest grossing movie of 1997, with a domestic haul of $107 million, to become The Oak's fifth highest grossing movie of all time.",Batman & Robin

Or is that Betty Crocker?",5,13 May 2008,"Operating Under the false premise that ""More is Better"", Director Schumacher and the Production Team gave us a larger than normal Super-Hero vs. Super-Baddies romp. One might even say that this was a sort of attempt at Cinematic ""Biggie Sizing"" a la the Hamburger Drive-Thru business, and you'd most likely be correct.But alas, it was but a short time after the release of this BATMAN AND ROBIN (Polygram Pictures/Warner Brothers, 1997) that the Political Correctness Police in conjunction with the Anti-Fast Food Fascist Party Movement's began a bombardment of messages on our very sense of propriety in the realm and Court of Public Opinion; and exerted considerable pressure and threat of Congressional Hearings re: the Fast Food Enterprises of McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and the like. Their Objective was to save the American Public from the Hideous Hidden Horrors holding Hellish control over our people via excessive cholesterol, over abundant amounts of saturated fat and mega-doses of RED MEATS!! The FOOD SHIRTS (as the Food Fascists are called) explained that the high level of dietary integrity of our great Nation was their objective and the Fast Food outlets were not in compliance with nutritional standards commensurate with those for a standard Dinner or Supper for a Family of 4 (or 400 for that matter!) WE tend to agree with the ""SHIRTS"" to a degree; but must take exception to such extreme and overbearing sanctions and threats to otherwise legal and honorable food purveyors. After all, the Burger, Fries & Coke combos were not intended to provide ""real"" meals; but rather to be used as any occasional special treat or snack. We believe that Government intervention concerning the burger or chicken chains' menu was unnecessary and decisions about these places should be left up to the individual parental couples.Of course, fearing reprisals from Bureaucratic Enforcer$ with Big Buck$ in their budget$, the restaurant chains acquiesced and modified their menus and portions.It's just too bad that the Production team of BATMAN AND ROBIN weren't subjected to similar pressure and didn't work to de-emphasize their ""Bigger Is Better Program."" They went ahead and followed the previously established practice of using two different Villains from the Comics Pages in unrelated stories in one film. Although the initial BATMAN (Polygram /Warner Bros., 1989) featured only Jack Nicholson's Joker vs. Michael Keaton's Batman, and one could make a strong argument that having the Origin retold and presenting the Joker merited the whole film. Beginning with the next installment; two bad guys was the norm.Hence, with the release of BATMAN RETURNS (Polygram/Warners, 1992), our attention and Batman's vengeful sleuthing are both divided between Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and their super gross, depressing and grotesque version of The Penguin (Danny DeVito). With BATMAN FOREVER (Polygram/Warners., 1995), and the ""middle inning"" change of ""Pitchers"" (Directors) from Tim Burton to Joel Schumacher, the policy continued. ""New"" Batman (Val Kilmer) did battle with both an excellent and manic Riddler (even more manic Jim Carrey) and a most excellently portrayed Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) in an entry to the series that we found to be a-okay, pretty damn good. While it was surely no masterpiece, it touched all the bases and we found Val Kilmer's portrayal of the Caped Crusader to be just fine; wondering later as to just why he called it off after only one Picture. Next time around, we had BATMAN AND ROBIN (Polygram/Warner Brothers, 1997) with Mr. Val Kilmer out and Hollywood Heart Throb, George Clooney in. The Brass at Warner Brothers must have anticipated or even craving a big, Big Summer Blockbuster of a Picture and did their best to insure its successful ascension to that level. WE have visions of ""the Suits"" over at Warner Brothers and Polygram Productions checking out and putting their imprimatur on the film script; but first adding on ingredients not at first present. There was already another ""New"" Batman (Mr. Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell). To this we add another different Bat Girl (Alicia Silverstone) not Barbara Gordon, daughter of the Commissioner. The 2 for 1 villain sale continued with Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzeneggar). As usual, there was little story, if any, in which their anti-Batman activities crossed. The adaptation of these characters from Comics to Screen was at least adequate and Miss Thurman's Poison Ivy was a really great likeness for the more latter day villainess (from the late 1960's Batman Jokebooks).To the Schwarzenegger version of the Mr. Freeze characterization, we see also certain elements akin to the old Universal Horror Films of the 1930's. The storing of Mrs. Freeze in that suspended animation tank is truly reminiscent of a scene with Karloff in THE BLACK CAT (Universal, 1934), I think. Mr. Freeze is also elevated into some sort of super-Scientific Martyr & Genius, who suffers because of a lost love'.ON top of all the rest of this, we can see the boys in the Corporate Offices just heaping on all sorts of extras on top of an already full plate. ""More car chases!, Pass the Henchmen, please! Let's have bigger highways & Gotham City Buildings. How 'bout another Colossus Statue.""NO Schultz, More is not necessarily better.ODDITY NOTED: Other than PREDATOR(Americent Films/American Entertainment Partners L.P./20th Century-Fox, 1987), this film may be the only other time that a film cast can boast of having two future U.S. Governors in Messers the Honorable Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and (our cousin) the incumbent sitting Governor of the Great State of California in Mr. Arnold Schwarzenneggar.NOTE: * Stricty speaking of course, Batman is not a Super Hero in the truest sense of the term; for he has no Super Powers ala Superman, Captain Marvel, The Human Torch,etc. More properly, he is classified as A Costumed Crime Fighter; which is the Super Herors' 1st Cousin.",Batman & Robin
64,zkonedog,A Farce In Nearly Every Sense,2,11 March 2017,"When watching the predecessor to this film, Batman Forever, one can tell that the Batman franchise was beginning to slip under the direction of Joel Schumacher. However, that film was saved by the acting power of Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey. This film has no such luck.Essentially, everything that is considered sacred in the Batman cannon is turned into a farce in this movie. Instead of villains with interesting backstories, we get the completely non-viable ""Mr. Freeze"" and the even worse ""Poison Ivy"". Instead of dark, brewing, revenge-filled acting from Batman and Robin, we get two superheroes (and later the annoying Batgirl) clowning around with each other and only getting their act together during crunch time. Instead of a dark, realistic atmosphere, we get a film in which James Bond would find himself right at home, what with all the explosions, flashing lights, and trite gadgets.Essentially, a film that gave us George Clooney in a Batsuit complete with two nipples has very little going its way. Only Arnold Schwarzenegger shines as the hulking (though, again, completely non-viable) Mr. Freeze. Perhaps Mr. Schumacher was trying to bring the film franchise back to its days as 1960s camp, but in either case he failed miserably. There is a reason why it took another Bat-sequel so long to get off the ground.If there is one Batman film to skip, this is the one. Just get through Batman Forever and call it a victory (until Batman Begins, of course!).",Batman & Robin
65,johnnyboyz,"Falling short of previous entries and as a standalone film, Batman & Robin deserves its derision's but might have been so much more.",5,4 February 2013,"To many, it is a crime to even speak of an opinion which doesn't resemble something along the lines of: ""it's terrible; one of the worst films of all time"" when talking of Batman & Robin, and yet I found it difficult to loath the film as much as many others do; a film I found immensely difficult to like, true, but a film tough to truly despise. It clocks in at around two and a half hours, yet appears to zip along at a rate that feels like 90 minutes; attempts, to its credit, to tackle material you rarely see in other films of its ilk that are of a similarly large scale/low quality (namely, the relationships people have with their families; best friends; partners; lovers) and seems to have been made with a generally balanced political ethic wherein men and women are allowed to play heroes as well as the villains and are both subjected to objectified sequences whereby they must make the transition from everyday personnel to rubber suited superhero.But the film is still far from good. Observe the criticisms people set aside for the previous: 1995's ""Batman Forever""; the second sequel to the then-reinvigorated Batman franchise, a film that was louder and more colourful than Burton's efforts. ""Forever"" was the one with the crash, bang wallop aesthetic; the erratic villains, whose delivery of their lines was just a tad more exuberant than their attire; the neon sign littered setting and the generally childish tone to it all. It wasn't bad (it wasn't much good), but copped a lot of flak for what it was because of these things. Observe then, if you will, Batman & Robin: a film with each of these characteristics and more; all of the above, that are not only omnipresent once again, but cranked up to the sorts of levels you'd think the makers would be trying to avoid. Concrete proof that filmmakers rarely take notice of critics, or criticism, might very well lie right here in the form of this 1997 addition.Returning director Joel Schumacher wastes no time in plunging us into his idea of what Batman ought to look like. Indeed, the first words uttered by our leads are jealous remarks on how Batman always seems to get the girls and that ""this is why Superman works alone"", all before the chief of police is allowed to deliver some painful exposition on this entry's bad guy. That bad guy arrives in the form of a certain Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger), someone who, by comparison, crash-lands into the film and does well to remind us of what a good job Burton actually did in integrating his film's villains into the central arc of what was happening. At a museum, Freeze and his lackeys (who look distinctly less interested when exposed to the extreme cold at their hideout later on than they do here when trying to foil Batman and Robin) are stealing a large diamond culminating in rocket-set fight over Gotham City – a rocket Batman points out will kill thousands if it explodes.....before he actually explodes it himself anyway.It turns out Freeze's intentions with the diamond were NOT for monetary gain, but for sake of trying to save his wife: a woman in a frozen state with an incurable disease, and he must find numerous others of its ilk to help save her. Along the way, he picks up Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy; someone who stumbles into a big-shot's diabolical scheme (ala Selena Kyle, in ""Returns"") and pays the penalty of death before she is reincarnated into an entity representative of her previous incarnation's opposites: (shy, cat-loving, useless with men & plant obsessed, isolated, ""nerd, etc.). Ivy is in Gotham City to propose to Wayne an idea that saves energy but costs human lives. She is rejected along the lines of Jim Carrey's character last time out, eventually swearing a sort of revenge that syncs up with the overall characteristic of their plan in the first place. What is disappointing, however, is how someone of Ivy's ilk is depicted when not in ""homicidal"" mode: those who love plants, or are of a ""greener"" political ilk, are seemingly crazed and whacked-out. There is a sub-plot utilising Ivy's good looks, and how Robin falls for the illusion of love induced by scented dust she allows them to inhale. This is cheap and easy; the using of this dust fast tracks any potential for naturalistic seduction that might play out and side-steps any faith the makers have in their ability to develop Ivy and Robin's tryst as she tries to lure him into a poison kiss.It is a shame the film is what it is, because there are some ground floor ideas that are quite interesting: the sense you get that Freeze was never necessarily evil, given he only really goes bonkers once he's under the illusion Batman has killed his wife for good; Bruce Wayne's struggles with holding down a long term relationship are in there; his on-going internal feud with Robin might have had more meat to it while even the character who'll come to play Batgirl's eerie fascination with speeding vehicles and death races, because her parents met their doom in a road traffic accident, is an interesting basis upon which to explore a very morbid state whereby one turns one's trauma into the way one deals with it: think Christopher Walken's character in The Deer Hunter. Alas, the film is too child-friendly and too all over the place to follow up on any of these elements; a schizophrenic project with one approach for any scene set inside Wayne Manor and another for anything outside it. I found it hard to accept as flat-out terrible, and just as the reaction to the later Nolan films was too much in one direction of opinion, so too is the response to this entry.",Batman & Robin
66,filipemanuelneto,"The expected end of ""Batman"" franchise",1,27 March 2016,"This film is the end of ""Batman"" franchise, started by Tim Burton and continued by Joel Schumacher throughout the nineties. This time, Schumacher directed an almost entirely new cast, headed by George Clooney (as the black knight), Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Mr. Freeze), Chris O'Donnell (in the role of Robin) and Uma Thurman (as Poison Ivy). An star-cast that could, in fact, have ensured the success of this film, but that was completely prevented from doing so by an incompetent director and a script that would have better utility serving as toilet paper.In fact, the Batman franchise, that this movie puts an end (finally), started badly with ""Batman"" (1989) but only managed to worsen constantly, in a dizzying descent to the dustbin of the Seventh Art. This film is beyond comprehension and good taste: the meager existing humor moments are regrettable, the scenarios are absurd, the costumes missed any attempt of realism, the picture is rather amateurish and the actor's interpretation seems confused and superficial, with each actor playing alone, according his own criteria. At this point, it lacked a firm director who could do the work better.In my opinion, its not by chance that the franchise ended. It was the best thing to do because it began under bad premises and all that is born crooked rarely straightens. Nevertheless, these films continued, for almost ten years, to be a spot on Batman's figure, excommunicating it from cinema until 2005, the year of his more than deserved rehabilitation, with ""Batman Begins"". In addition to these losses, the franchise also marked negatively the understanding of the audience regarding cinematographic comic-book adaptations, but this brand passed quickly thanks to the interesting (some better than others) adaptations made since the year 2000. For all these reasons, and especially for ""Bat-fans"", the end of this franchise was especially expected, although perhaps not left many good memories.",Batman & Robin

68,TheMovieDiorama,Batman & Robin is essentially a relentless blizzard of puns.,2,21 November 2018,"How to describe the legendary status that Batman & Robin upholds? It's icy cool. It freezes the competition. It froze my heart (and my critical senses). An avalanche of God knows what to be honest. I was numb to its cold touch. Unable to thaw my soul. Oh, and don't forget about the plants! Because Poison Ivy's garden needs tending and Robin was about to hit the honey pot. Christ, just...Christ. What was this Schumacher? What. Was. This? Batman and Robin must save Gotham city from an ""endless winter"" as Mr Freeze teams up with Poison Ivy to destroy the city. That's it. It really is that simple. It's clear that Schumacher was attempting to replicate the campiness of 60's Batman. But aside from the splendid set pieces and ""what killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!"", everything failed. Ev-er-y-thing. Clooney, with his luscious ""batnips"", has all the personality of melting snow. I could feel his boredom, and that's with his ""batcard"" because you should ""never leave the cave without it"". O'Donnell ended his career by wearing rubber lips and joyfully stating ""chicks did the car!"". Silverstone also ended her career by just being shoe-horned in. Schwarzenegger somehow turned in one of the more tolerable performances. Thurman...well, I don't even know? One moment she's all ""we must save the plants!"" to ""my mutant plants are the deadliest"". The script was just diabolical. There's no other way to describe it. ""This is why Superman works alone."", ""The Ice Man cometh!"", ""Great stems, though..."", ""Buds, too."" and of course ""How about slippery when wet?"". Poison Ivy is hornier than a flipping rabbit. Mr Freeze can't say a sentence without mentioning ice. Robin just wants a car. Barbara apparently puts on a convincing disguise, ""It's me, Barbara! I found the batcave."". This isn't even the tip of the iceberg. Oh no no no! Their boots conveniently turn into ice skates. Batgirl has ""batboobs"". The most basic of jumps are clearly wired stunts.

73,jzappa,Where's Adam West?,5,19 September 2006,"Batman & Robin is more of a send-up of the old Batman TV show with Adam West and Burt Ward. It looks like a classy new take on the Batman series with surplus style, which it is, but in terms of the script, it's a spoof of the already hilarious old TV show. I have never heard dialogue so retarded in my life. Did Arnold Schwarzenegger actually maintain his level of pride as he said things like, ""What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!!!"" My personal favorite is when Batman drops onto the floor in front of Mr. Freeze, played with enthusiasm by Arnold, who remarks, ""Nice of you to drop by."" I think it's so obvious and stupid that you can't help but laugh. I could go on and on and on with some of the worst little clips of dialogue ever to be written in a film that wasn't meant as a comedy or at least a satire of itself. Hey, there must be something about the writer. He must have something to offer, having moved on to be the Oscar-winning writer of A Beautiful Mind.When I talked about this film's visual style, I never said that it was good. I think it's just a super-stylized way of being just as campy as the Adam West show. It's hardly much different than the visual delivery of Batman Forever, also directed by Joel Schumacher, but at least it never crossed that line and maintained respectable enough dialogue. Everything in Batman & Robin is done for effect right at the very moment it's done, no matter what comes before or after: Mr. Freeze smokes a cigar in one scene, which, given the condition of his changed genetics, he should not be capable of doing. The Batmobile and Mr. Freeze's humongous tank make the jump from a statue to a roof with no problem, that is, after Batman immobilizes Robin's much lighter motorbike because he doesn't think Robin can make the jump with it.Everything I have to say about Batman & Robin has probably been said by everybody else already. In fact, everyone I know has said it, and I'm sure the IMDb reviews are saying it, judging by this film's rating on here. I must say, this movie does have one thing I like about it, and that is the Smashing Pumpkins song in the final credits. It's a great song. Stick around for it if you haven't turned it off already.",Batman & Robin

Bear in mind I'm a big fan of the 60s TV series, and this is the only film that recaptures that atmosphere. (Of course nothing can beat the 40s chapter serials, but it's a bit unfair to compare them to any of the feature films.)A work of art it ain't, but I'll take the candy cane colours on display here over the gloomy atmosphere of the other films any day.",Batman & Robin
76,FiendishDramaturgy,Simply dismal.,4,1 October 2003,"George Clooney should have never been cast in the role of Batman. He blew it from the instant his character appeared on the screen. His acting here is horrid, and introducing him in full regalia and in the throes of battle did nothing whatsoever to hide the fact that he was agonizingly deplorable. The addition of ice skates in the boots of the super heroes was as lame as anything I grew up with in the 60's and 70's TV show. All in all this was a horribly disappointing movie, complete with standard Hollywood fare: trying effects; cheesy dialog and absolutely no build up to the story line whatsoever. The characters were underdeveloped, and over dramatized. The scenes were shot as if a ten year old snuck away to the mall with daddy's video camera and shot them; the effects were the worst sort, and the dialog was reminiscent of a kindergarten stage production. Joel Schumacher should be forbidden to have anything at ALL to do with everything even remotely Batman related from this point on. Seriously, he has just about destroyed any chance of redeeming this wonderful series of movies. The heroes fly about on snowboards propelled by....what? Their gadgets, now totally hi-tech and possibly the lamest of all four movies thus far had me rolling my eyes before the first ten minutes of the movie were completed. In comparison to the 60's cars used throughout, it was highly out of place. A seriously lame anachronism. Mr. Freeze's dialog was obviously geared for the target audience of 9 year olds (not to insult any 9 year olds out there), and his character was so underdeveloped, I remember the audience asking throughout the theater, ""Who's that?""Furthermore, his character never achieves the appropriate dominance required to be a convincing ""bad guy"" of this caliber. His character was a weak, flaccid excuse for a villain. No fault of Schwarzenegger's, I'm sure. Again, I blame the direction. His thug-some gang of hockey/skater punks just made me laugh. Lame, lame, lame. Mr. Freeze left me feeling a bit...cold. Sorry, it's the movie's influence. Uma Thurman's performance was excellent as Poison Ivy, although her character was even less developed than was Mr. Freeze's. By the time they got around to trying to give you any history at all concerning the two villains, it was far too little and way too late. By that time, the audience just didn't CARE about their history. They had already lost the viewers' interest by failing miserably to properly introduce the characters. And by attempting to foist George Clooney upon us by shoving him into an action scene at the movie's open was a shoddy directional device not even worthy of a first year film student. ""Bane"" was played as infantile and was another factor which led to my loathing of this movie. Bane was a force to be reckoned with in the comic books. Whether you're a fan of that medium or not, this has to matter at least to some degree. His character was either written, directed, or portrayed (I really don't care which) to be about as bright and interesting as a rock. No, I take that back. I've seen some rocks which interested me greatly. His character was reminiscent to me, with his inane growling and total lack of intelligence, of the villains portrayed in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. That's NOT a good thing, people. The Eye Candy turned out to be more like Eye...Sores.The circus-like atmosphere throughout the movie was inappropriate as a ""Dark Knight"" setting. I could not believe how horrible was the direction of this flick. As a fan of the comic heroes and the first two installments of this series, this movie was a complete let down. The dialog throughout is trite and campy; they tried too hard to be witty and clever and failed horribly. Instead of hard and edgy, fresh and foreboding, George Clooney's Batman was soft, weak and ignorant. I hated him as Batman. Put him in Jurassic Park 4. Cast him as living bait for ANYTHING carnivorous. That would be the perfect role for him. Alicia Silverston as Batgirl was a horrible casting choice. Meg Ryan would have made a more convincing Batgirl. Seriously though, almost anyone would have been better cast in this role. Her assuming the role as Batgirl degrades the character to mere fluff, instead of the gritty, edgy presence that issues from Batgirl's character in the comic books.Meanwhile, back at Mr. Freeze's lair: The ridiculous show tunes he forces his henchmen to sing for his amusement have even the henchmen casting confused looks at one another as if to say, ""This is not the movie we auditioned for...is it?"" I really don't have anything good to say about this movie. I wanted to when I sat down to write this, but as I watch it, I simply cannot find it in myself to do it. If Mr. Schumacher's goal was to recreate the campy drivel of the original TV series from the 60's & 70's, then he succeeded completely. Much to my dismay. With the announcement of Batman Begins due to be released in 2005, I refuse to even begin to get my hopes up until I see who will direct it. The late Michael Gough obviously won't be Alfred, either. He was about the only good thing this movie offered. As a true Schwarzenegger fan, I just don't have the heart to say anything more. Uma Thurman and Michael Gough were the only bright lights in this otherwise horrid installment of modern day Batman movies. It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Batman & Robin
77,elshikh4,Too Frosted Ice Cream !,6,5 July 2008,"Remember when Batman was spellbound by the power of Poison Ivy, doing irrational things? The movie's makers were exactly like him here, spellbound by the power of big budget, Batman fame, and creating any clamorous vapidity, as long as it's clamorous anyway, which produced eventually irrational movie!The biggest downside wasn't that writer (Akiva Goldsman), along with director (Joel Schumacher), wanted to transform the dark and gloomy world of (Tim Burton)'s first 2 Batman movies into close-to-cartoon visual extravaganza. It was in the idiot result of that itself. Simply the movie wasn't that crazy inasmuch as that cheesy. Nearly everything and everybody looked silly, and perfectly chintzy. And the studio's own vendetta against (Burton) hit them in the face!Moreover, (Uma Thurman) was unconvincing as a magical eve, if not unbearable as well. Her make-up was childish and hatful. (George Clooney) knew the whole situation. It's Hollywood same ol' same ol' nonsense again and again, and at that very moment, the poor doctor from ""ER"" wanted to make a little legacy of nonsense for himself because this is, and this is only, the way to be the bankable star in this mad city. The best thing about it was that he didn't exert a lot of efforts, as he understood fully the power of the suit and the mask to destroy any actor beneath them, not to mention how in this movie Batman was the most frigid, the less cynical, and most of the time in the suit more than all the antecedent Batmen.Let alone that there is an obvious matter of rhythmic disorder whereas there is one big battle in the start which the climax itself can't compete with. That can make the viewer, any viewer, feels deficiency, and be surely unsatisfied.The good side: I loved (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as the comic villain, or rather a parody of himself. All of his lines was smartly funny. Most of the cast did well. And I won't deny that I liked some of the crazy action in chromatic hurly-burly that this movie heavily provides. Sorrowfully, aside from this, nothing was as good!So if the movie's makers' intention was making a brainless entertainment, they succeeded in just the brainless part.

79,freemantle_uk,One of the Worst Superhero Films Ever,1,6 September 2008,"Batman and Robin is one of the worst superhero films ever made. It is a great example of studio interference gone mad, and betraying the source material. Batman is anything but a little hearted camp character and the sixties TV show has a lot to answer. The studio thought that Batman was a family friendly character and looked to make money from all the toy sells afterwards. The only good think about this film is that it ended the Burton/Schumacher era and brought about Christopher Nolan who made the excellent Batman Begins and the Dark Knight.The plot is thin. The film starts with Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) stopping a robbery at the Gotham National History Museum by Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The dynmatic duo stop him, but the super villain escapes. This starts to cause a rift between Batman and Robin. At the time in South America Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman), a botanist and environmentalist discoveries that her boss had been secretly making a brainless beast with superstrength, Bane. During the clash between the scientists an accident happens and Pamela becomes Posion Ivy. She goes to Gotham City with Bane and becomes an extreme environmentalist, making a proposal to Bruce Wayne to save the environment, but kill millions of people. Posion Ivy and Freeze team up to take over Gotham. A subplot of the film is Bruce's loyal butler Alfred had become ill. His niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone), comes to take care of him. She clashes with Bruce because she believes that the billionaire never let Alfred live his own life. However, she is a trained fighter and ends up becoming Batgirl.There are a number of problems with this film. It is too campy, the kind of Batman which an comic book fan hates. It is gadget heavy, the executives at Warner Brothers had ideas for the toy lines, and it just made things too convenient. Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger and giving him top-billing was terrible decision. Schwarzenegger is not a good actor; he was best in the first two Terminator films and Predator. Uma Thurman must have been embarrassed by her performance in this film, no one stood out for have a good performance. The writing is not good, there were some awful cheesy lines, like 'ice to you see' (which was taken from the Simpsons) and 'you're not sending me back to the cooler'. The Batman comics were not even looked at and the Sixties show was base for this bad film. Like with all the Batman films before Nolan, the plot was thin, but Batman and Robin takes it to new levels and the filmmakers may as well have not bothered. Nolan was able to make Batman into a dark complex character, dealing with ideas and were brilliantly written. Even the people who made Batman and Robin have disowned it. George Clooney said he will refuse money if anyone comes up to him and said their paid to see Batman and Robin, Chris O'Donnell said it was like making a long toy ad and Joel Schumacher see this as his worst work and wanted to make a Batman film to please the fans, taking the character back to his dark roots. The screenwriter Akiva Goldsman was also ashamed of this film and has tried to make completely different films afterwards.Batman and Robin is a great example of when a studio becomes too involved with making the film. They did not care what happened as long as the film made money, but it ended up being a box-office flop. People will pay to see quality and that is why the action films that make the most money are also critically acclaimed. This ranges from superhero films like the X-Men, Spider-man and Nolan's Batman, to Casino Royale. Tom Rothman, president of Fox Movies wants to make the Wolverine film into a family-friendly film.

80,JoeB131,Almost destroyed the franchise with gayness,1,26 October 2009,"Okay, what was wrong with this movie. Probably be easier to write, what wasn't wrong with this movie, but what fun would that be and it probably wouldn't fill IMDb's requisite 10 lines. Kevlar nipples! The horror!Let's start with Arnold. Arnold could have played the role straight. The Batman animated series of the 1990's re-imagined Mister Freeze as a sympathetic villain, but any sympathy for the character is quickly dissipated by Arnold's need to do ""ice-based"" puns. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy is equally one-dimensional. Okay, so then you get Batman. Not really Batman's fault. Batman's villains have always been more interesting than he is. Sadly, by the fourth movie, they had already gone through his first string villains and were reduced to the second string. George Clooney was completely wrong for the role. He simply wasn't capable of the ruthlessness you need to play Batman. Heck, Michael Keaton seemed more intense, and that's just sad. Chris O'Donnel as Batman's life partner Robin. (Okay, I'm really, really trying to avoid the gay puns here!) He was okay in the third movie, where he has some chemistry with Val Kilmner, but here, uh, not so much. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Besides the fact they bastardized the character by making her Alfred's niece instead of Commissioner Gordon's daughter. Not really interesting at all and no reason why she'd want to join this gay crime-fighting club. Of course, we have Vivica Fox and Elle McPherson as the love interests of Freeze and Wayne. Oh, except that they aren't into girls, so what was even the point of putting them into the movie? Oh, hey, Bane was in the movie. Too bad they didn't actually read any comics where Bane was an interesting character in his own right. I couldn't imagine even casual Batman fans liking this movie. In fact, I couldn't imagine who could like this movie.",Batman & Robin
81,Coxer99,Batman & Robin,7,30 June 1999,"Fourth and most disappointing in the series about the Caped Crusader with Clooney being the only bright light in the entire mess which pits Batman against Mr. Freeze (campy Arnold) and Poison Ivy (awful Uma). Clooney's downplay of both Batman and Bruce Wayne is quite effective, while O'Donnell's Robin remain a whiny brat. The addition of Silverstone as BatGirl is silly and only for box office draws...it doesn't help and neither does director Schumacher's constant handling of the material.He treats it like a fourth grade diorama...Come to think of it, maybe he should go back to fourth grade!",Batman & Robin
82,XweAponX,"As ridiculous as this movie is, it's exactly like a comic book",10,7 May 2014,"I enjoyed all four of the earlier Batman movies, even with the Musical Batmans of the last two, First Val Kilmer then George Clooney. But what I liked about this one - In THIS rendition, they returned to Bob Kane's original imagery for Gotham City. I understand this is probably the least popular of the four original films, but I still like it, much more than I ever expected to like it.And of course, this film of all four is most like the original Batman TV show from the 60's which I loved - Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane, all LOOK like they looked in the comics. They talked like the comics, they acted like comic book characters, because that's what they are.I would have cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Bane and not Mr Freeze, but then again, Bane had no lines, only grunts and occasional parroting of other lines.The Cityscape of Gotham City is Teutonic and Outrageous, you have to love it. Can you imagine a City that has Monolithic Statues with transit expressways running through them? Can you imagine an Observatory built on the outstretched hands of a huge statue? And Arkham Asylum as well. This is a Gotham City that matches in a lot of ways some of the Detective Comics of the 40's in imagery and spirit.Of course this is a silly movie - But I loved Arnold's Mr Freeze, Uma's Poison Ivy- There were even cameos by Ralf Moeller and Jesse Ventura. There is even a small part by Doug Hutchison aka ""Tooms"". the Contorting, liver-eating guy from The X Files.If you want Two Hours and Five Minutes of nothing but pure Detective Comics, then this has it. It's best to just sit back and let this film be what it was intended to be, I've seen it a few times as well as just now and I have always enjoyed it. This is less like Frank Miller's Dark Night graphical novel and more like the comics from the 60's which is when I first picked up a Batman comic. And this is not at all like the first Tim Burton version, which had Batman using Machine Guns - The main aspect of Batman from the Comics, is that he never uses guns and he never kills anyone.Chris Nolan's Trilogy was based more on Frank Miller's vision of The Dark Night, and even that version would not have Batman ever killing a man - But he would ""Not have to save him"" as he does to ""Ras Al Ghul"".So I highly enjoyed this, even as much as the first two and as much as Nolan's trilogy. It's worth it just to see Uma prance around in Green Leotard.",Batman & Robin
83,alindsay-al,An absolutely terrible film that should not exist,1,14 July 2014,"Now after Batman Forever there should have been absolutely no expectation on this film and it shows as this is easily the worst comic book film of all time and it is one of the worst films of all time. This shows the trio of Batman, Robin and Batgirl attempting to stop the villainous trio of Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane. Now by the title you can tell that this film is co-led by both Batman and Robin and this was a bad idea from the start. George Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman was quite a similar performance as Val Kilmer meaning I believe that his performance as Bruce Wayne was decent but he was not Batman and was just an awful representation of the character because of the cheesy film. Chris O Donell's performance as Robin is poor and incredibly cheesy just like the previous film and it hurt this film like the previous. Uma Thurman's clearly could act as she was once nominated for an Oscar but in this film oh my goodness she is so over the top in this film and is seemingly the worst actress alive in this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze was again terrible he just says one liners throughout the film and is such an over the top baddie. I wish Bane wasn't in this film because Schumacher decided to make Bane just a mindless thug which is so against his character and it is insulting that he would do that. The inclusion of Batgirl is another one as she was totally unnecessary and her character was just their to annoy throughout. The story is just plain dumb and makes absolutely no sense and I truly believe they didn't even bother to come up with a serious story. The script is the very worse script possibly in history and all the dialogue is pretty shocking for every character. The style could be the saving grace for this film but it absolutely shocking everybody is on a wire and the sets look horrific and it just adds to the terrible film. This is one of the worst films ever fact.",Batman & Robin

85,iquine,Shock And Awwwwful,2,23 February 2018,"(Flash Review)Everyone, absolutely everyone involved with this should hang their head in shame. Slight exception for Uma Thurman. Although under normal circumstances she may have overacted a bit, at least she appeared to be trying. Arnold was miscast as Dr. Freeze and his approach was to just be John Matrix from Commando. His dialog was pretty much all one-liners. Yes, this is Arnold but it was a bit much for a movie where he isn't just a one-man-show; his bread and butter. It wasn't just Arnold, the whole script could have been written better by a drunk college kid 'minoring' in English. I cracked grimaces rather than a smiles from the comedy. For how massive a budget this had, I was stunned by how unconvincing the special effects were and how terrible, brash and immature the lighting was. The story had as much tension as a soggy noodle which was about Mr. Freeze attempting to freeze Gotham until he stole enough money to fund a cure for his disease-stricken wife. And Poison Ivy, a plant-loving villain who throws wrenches into Batman and Robin's plans and partnership while teaming up with Mr. Freeze (of course) for reasons that escape me. Throw in a whinny Robin, Batgirl as an afterthought, costumes with unnecessary nipples, bad directing, high school quality sets, muddled story, effects on par with 1980's Superman (15+ years later) and that is how you lose truckloads of cash in Hollywood.",Batman & Robin
86,smatysia,Not nearly as bad as people think,7,8 April 2000,"I liked this movie. I must admit that it was not as good as the first two films in this series, with the dark ambience and the damaged and brooding Batman. But it is by no means awful.  Now, I haven't seen the third movie, nor did I ever read the Batman comics. I did see the silly '60's TV show, and liked it at the time, but, hey, I was seven. (Surely the target audience for that.) OK, as for B & R. I didn't think that Clooney could pull off the role. He did OK, but Michael Keaton was great as Batman, something I never would have believed before seeing it. O'Donnell was also OK. Then there is Ahh-nold. A pretty cool (ha-ha) part for him. Uma Thurman played her Poison Ivy role too far over the top, with more than a few nods to Mae West. I thought Alicia Silverstone did very well, although no one else seems to think so. Maybe she is just too adorable for me see past.  All in all, the script could have been better, too many zingers and one-liners. The Gotham City setting was a bit much. The direction seemed OK, meaning I never thought of the director at any time while viewing the show. Looking over this, it seems full of criticism, and doesn't convey why I enjoyed the movie. Well, I don't really know why. But I did.",Batman & Robin
87,barnabyrudge,"Poorly scripted, hopelessly uninvolving Batman entry.",3,8 November 2006,"Tim Burton's first instalment in this particular film series was a breath of fresh air  a super-hero movie with a visual mood and rhythm all of its own. But from there onwards, the series got progressively weaker until, in 1997, the low-point was reached with this utterly terrible fourth segment. Batman And Robin is an absolute catastrophe on so many levels. Usually a charismatic performer, Clooney here simply fails to register as the caped crusader. Thurman is nothing short of embarrassing as Poison Ivy, while Schwarzenegger spends the entire film barking out rotten dialogue (much of which revolves around bad ""ice jokes""). The film is directed without a shred of subtlety by Joel Schumacher, who somehow makes the whole sorry affair feel like a 125 minute MTV video! And worst of all is the Akiva Goldsman script, which scurries aimlessly from set piece to set piece without the slightest sense of narrative flow or development.In Gotham City, a new super villain threatens to destroy the peace. Ex-doctor Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a cryogenically frozen and extraordinarily strong man, plans to lay siege to the city until he can find a way to cure his wife, suffering from a mysterious illness. Batman (George Clooney) and his reckless young protégé Robin (Chris O'Donnell) must rid the city of this new menace. Meanwhile, two more villains appear on the scene. Firstly, Posion Ivy (Uma Thurman), a sexy plant-girl who can kill merely with a kiss from her venomous lips; secondly, Bane (Jeep Swenson), a hulking masked monster who serves Ivy. While they struggle to deal with this trio of evil baddies, Batman and Robin also find their own relationship under increasing strain as they argue over their respective roles (""this is why Superman works alone!"" grumbles Batman at one point, as Robin continually irritates him.) As well as this, Batman's faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) begins to find his health declining. It turns out he has the same disease as Freeze's wife, and his death is imminent.Batman And Robin is energetic, but totally devoid of real emotion and depth. For all the variety of action and destruction up there on the screen, there's no soul to any of it. Not a single scene comes across as being exciting, sad, funny, romantic, scary or thought-provoking. Like I said, the film fails to engage on even the most basic emotional level. It's just eye candy  lots of colourful sets and costumes, flashing lights, whizzing cameras, fancy explosions  but nothing to nourish the brain. You might think that a film of this kind would at least make partial amends with ground-breaking special effects, but in some sequences the effects are decidedly weak. Batman and Robin swoop on hoverboards from a booby-trapped rocket, but the explosion when it occurs looks like a cheap and clumsy back projection shot. Alicia Silverstone rides over the edge of a high drop on her motorbike and is saved by O'Donnell. as she hangs precariously upside down, the blue screen rear projection work is hopelessly fake. When even the technical aspects of a Batman movie aren't up to par, you KNOW you're in trouble! On the whole Batman And Robin is a sorry affair which is an insult to fans of the series, fans of comic book heroes and fans of good cinema!",Batman & Robin
88,davispittman,An enjoyable and fun popcorn flick,7,14 February 2015,"Released in the summer 1997, right after a successful Batman Forever. Batman and Robin starting George Clooney, Chris Odonnel, Uma Thurman, and Alicia Silvestone was released with high hopes. And I watched this movie as a kid, and admired every part of it. I bought it recently on DVD because I really enjoy it. Now yes, it does have it's flaws, it needs to tone down the ice puns, and the scene where Mr. Freeze directs his henchmen singing, that should never have happened. As far as casting, Uma was great as poison ivy, and Arnold was OK as Mr. Freeze, George was alright, and I think Chris was great as Robin, and lastly Alicia wasn't the best for the role of Batgirl.

The first Batman was done by Tim Burton and had Jack Nicholson playing his magic. The second had Tim directing again and had a dark, great script and wonderful, non-computer generated sets. The third film done by Schumacker, suffered from over done sets, but had great villains and Val Kilmer did a great job as Batman. This film has nothing going for it. It has Clooney, who is the worst Batman and extremely overdone computer animation. The whole film has green and red lights flashing everywhere and it tends to hurt your eyes. The villains were really lame too. Uma Thurman is a good actress, but she was horrid in this as Poison Ivy. Arnold plays Mr. Freeze and is okay, but it is such a boring character. Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, and again is absolutely horrible!!!!!! I enjoyed very little in this, but I don't feel it deserves a one.My rating: Horrible!!!!! 121 mins.

On a brighter note, this is the best acting I have ever seen George Clooney do (and yes I have seen Syriana, Burn After Reading, Out of Sight, Oceans whatever and the works, the guy just does not convince me as an actor) but this Clooney was so bad he was good.UMA IF YOU HAVE AN Oscar, GIVE IT BACK!!!!F-",Batman & Robin
92,Movie-ManDan,A Well-Done Bad Movie.,5,4 November 2014,"Generally considered one of the worst things ever brought to the screen, Batman & Robin is very fun. When people say this movie is terrible, I agree but they never acknowledge the redeeming qualities, which are what make this movie bad. Doesn't make much sense? Arnold delivers cheesy puns and one-liners galore, they do suck but are hilarious at the same time. George Clooney does such a bad job, you can't help laughing. Everybody is so over-the-top and cheesy, you have to laugh. That may be why Chris O'Donnell's and Silverstone's careers were pretty much ruined after this: gets recognized for Scent of a Woman; breaks out in Batman Forever; then gets screwed in this. Silverstone does some music videos, breaks out in Clueless, then gets screwed by this. All other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted. The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting. I did say the acting is funny, but after a while it gets to be too much. It starts off fun, but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters. It just keeps going until you have enough. I know that two hours isn't very long for a movie, but in this case, it was. Just take twenty minutes away and it would have been better.2/4",Batman & Robin

Of course, I'm talking about Batman and Robin. Made on a big budget that was larger than its predecessors, this movie barely made back its budget and forced WB to redo the franchise with an origin story that was darker than its other movies and paved the way for the peak of the franchise with The Dark Knight and its final chapter, The Dark Knight Rises. It is the only movie in the history of DC comics to feature Robin (besides the serials). Chris O'Donnell as Robin is pretty good, while the other cast members are lackluster save for Uma Thurman who is hot as ivy!!!

94,eric262003,I'll Never Forgive You Schumacher,1,12 December 2016,"Wow! This movie was absolutely incredible! The acting, the settings, the costumes, the direction and the script all fit into place an an immaculate fashion. Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect as Mr. Freeze and George Clooney captured the spirit of the Dark Knight like no other performer. Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone excelled very nicely in the female leads. There's absolutely nothing negative I have to say about this movie except...WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAW? If anyone who bit into my praises in the opening paragraph, I take complete pity on your souls. By way of contrast, if anyone didn't fall into my web of hypocrisy, then the more power to you. This is one of the worst movies ever made. Only ""Jonah Hex"" was worst and that's not saying much.And those who are wondering why this movie sucks monkey balls is because of hacks behind this film and the performers who signed onto to star in this contrivance of a movie. I don't understand why I was given this movie as a birthday gift. I'd rather have a hand grenade instead. When it first premiered in 1997 I was mad at Joel Schumacher for making ""Batman Forever"" a travesty. But because I'm a nice guy and everyone deserves a second chance, I said okay maybe he has learned from his mistakes and will at least make a decent film. NOT!I left the theatre angry just like all the other patrons who wasted their money over garbage like this movie. It seems that the filmmakers have gave Batman a complete makeover by turning one of the most iconic superhero franchises into a laughable joke. It's pathetic and careless and my ranting hasn't stopped.First of all what was the motive behind Mr. Freeze in his attempt to turn Gotham into an ice rink? There has to be a reason for his evil ways if we want to be invested into his character. Not the lame excuse of because he can. Why did Schumacher cast Arnold as Mr. Freeze to begin with? Was Arnold going through a phase where he didn't want to do anymore hardcore action flicks? Why did Clooney have a permanent smirk on his face? Batman is supposed to be vengeful and angry, not cheery and jovial. Maybe Clooney thought this film was stupid too and didn't really care about the movie either. What's Poison Ivy's beef with Batman? Why bother asking more questions?I can get a little bit of humour in a superhero action film can make the dark dreariness seems less sentimental, but the jokes were childish and the puns happened quite frequently it made me sick to my stomach. The straw that bit the camel's back was that this movie didn't make any sense at all. Freeze vows revenge on the city over the fate of his wife. What a crock! If he wants to unleash revenge, take it on the company and don't pin it on the city like everyone's to blame. And what's the deals with the solar-beams used to thaw out the ice. Sure nice day to get skin cancer, right? Uma Thurman transforms to Poison Ivy is also a major contrivance. We need some better scientific data as to why she became Poison Ivy. But Schumacher didn't want to complicate things to the younger audience so she gets thrown into some pool of feces and mutates into an evil villain complete with poison blood and the kiss of death and wardrobe change for that matter. Okay so Mr. Freeze wants to take on Batman I can vouch for that, but what's Ivy's gripe with Batman? Nothing at all! It's like me picking a fight with a bystander for the sake of walking in the other direction.When the dust finally clears, all I can sat that this is by far one of the worst films of the 1990's. The acting was horrible, the action sequences were juvenile and spontaneous and and the scenery is way too bright and colourful. When will Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman realize that Batman is not played for farcical jokes and playful amusement park scenarios? Batman is a dark brooding character fending off against diabolical characters with dark tones and a Gothic setting. Not an overblown circus with wimpy heroes and idiotic, laughable villains.I'm glad that years later, Christopher Nolan revived the Batman legacy by creating the dark and dreary atmosphere filled with scumbags littering a crime-infested city. And Christian Bale thank you for making us love and appreciate the Batman that was meant to be portrayed. Schumacher you killed off a franchise and for that I will never forgive you for it.",Batman & Robin
95,Sandcooler,Failed attempt at camp value,3,8 August 2010,"If I have to compare this movie to anything else featuring Batman, I'd say it's kinda like a long, expensive episode of the 60s TV-show. Then again, not really, because the TV-show was incredibly entertaining in its silliness. This movie however, it's just pretty painful. The characters barely have any dialogues, they're satisfied with just spouting terrible one-liners at nobody in particular. You could create a drinking game based on every one-liner that completely falls flat, but you'd die of alcohol poisoning well before halfway. The absolute worst: Mr.Freeze going ""let's kick some ice"". Someone got paid to write that, which is a downright terrifying thought. The actors try their best to save what there is to save, but apparently just fail to realise there is nothing to save. There's barely a plot, just unimpressive action scenes strung together because they vaguely connect. Even the annoyance that comes with the movie gets tiresome, so eventually it's just boring. The casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger is still pretty fun I guess, I'll give the project that much credit. Overall it's a disaster though.",Batman & Robin

This time from the clutches of the Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. With Ivy having the duo pitted against each other with her love potion, Freeze decides to cover the entire city in ICE. To make matters worse, their trusty butler Alfred is dying, from the same disease that took Mr. Freeze's wife. Can the help of Alfred's niece, BATGIRL be enough to stop Freeze and Ivy?Joel Schumacher took on the role of bringing the Batman series into a new direction, geared towards younger kids. Forever, although not of the same caliber of Burton's films, was a nice new touch to the series. This time, the power behind WB wants the series to go even younger, and now we have a film full of cheesy one liners, crappy product placements and well...Elle Macpherson.Batman and Robin continues the same style that was in Forever. Using the new bat suits with nipples, multiple villains, glow in the dark scenes and new crime fighters. Although, it takes a turn for the worse. Bad writing, bad cast, bad directing, mix them together and you get Batman and Robin.Right from the start you know that the film is going to be bad, because we see Mr. Freeze, horribly miss-cast, spitting out one-liners the likes of ""Chill"" ""Time to kick some ICE"" and ""Ice to see you!"" This is not like the villain at all. Freeze is suppose to be a skinny, intelligent scientist. The opening fight scenes are terrible, as we see Freeze's gun get knocked out of his hands and then for some reason fly and stick to the top of the museum dinosaur. Playing hockey? The entire scene is too laughable, and shows you exactly what you are in-store for.Another miscast would be the capped crusader himself. George Clooney, is not Bruce Wayne, or Batman for that matter. He doesn't have the charm, or the looks, or even the tone. If you really want to narrow it down, he doesn't even have the mouth for it. Clooney seemed too relaxed in the role, it seemed like he was just playing himself. Don't even get me started on Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. First of all, she shouldn't even be the in film, too many characters, and secondly, if you indeed wanted her in the film, then make sure you have an actress you knows how to act. Seeing her spit out her lines was horrible. Then again, acting along side Chris O'Donnell, she is Oscar worthy.The music, not as good as the Burton/Elfman score, does bring a smile to my face. It is a new style for the new films and it is really good. It fits perfectly with the whole Superhero/crime fighter style of the film. Other then Thurman, this is the only redeeming factor of the film.Thurman, what a beautiful woman, who guess what is able to act. She pulls off Poison Ivy perfectly. She may have annoyed some people, but that it exactly what Poison Ivy does. Posion Ivy is a beautiful red headed, green wearing, mother nature loving bombshell. With Thurman having her own input on her character and how she wears her hair/uniform it comes off as a little bit better then the character create din the comics/animated show.A lot of the scenes will make you laugh at how terrible they are, as well as make you roll your eyes at how convenient some things are, such as Freeze having those two cures in his suit for Alfred. Or how you can change the position of satellites to unfreeze the city. Not to mention the plot holes involving that.Out of all four films, this one is definitely the weakest. In fact, it's so weak, it's one of the weakest films put to screen. I understand that the filmmakers were making it for kids and trying to have fun with the project...but when you have something that has a huge fan base, you do not mess with the formula. Burton had done it right, twice, and Schumacher had one good hit, here he misses the ball completely. It's nice to see that they are re-starting the series again, this time for the true fans of the series...not Mcdonalds kids.",Batman & Robin
97,brando647,Watch it Out of Morbid Curiosity for the Trainwreck that Broke the Bat (Franchise),4,20 March 2015,"There is almost no point in voicing an opinion on BATMAN & ROBIN. There's nothing to be said for this movie that hasn't been commented on countless times before. The movie is an abomination (but not unwatchable) and it's been torn apart by just about everyone. Kevin Smith has a pretty entertaining commentary track for the movie available in his Fatman on Batman podcast, if anyone's interested. This movie is probably the most hated film on the Internet, if not tied with George Lucas' Star Wars prequels. It was the movie that put the final nail in the coffin of the first generation Batman movies that began with Tim Burton in 1989. The movie opens with an introduction to what can be argued as the film's main villain, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Freeze has plans toughfreeze Gotham and hold it ransom for the money he needs to continue research on a cure for his cryogenically frozen wife. Meanwhile, Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) arrives with a plot to manipulate Freeze, Batman, and Robin into doing her bidding in an attempt toI'm not really sure something about saving plants. As Batman and Robin argue over who has the hots for Poison Ivy more, Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying from MacGregor's Syndrome and his niece arrives at Wayne Manor to steal him away from his menial life as a rich man's servant. Then a bunch of mind-numbing cartoon stuff happens, Alicia Silverstone ruins Batgirl, and Arnold Schwarzenegger runs us through a gamut of horrible ice puns.BATMAN & ROBIN is so bad that members of the cast and crew have since come out to apologize for its existence. I'm not sure I believe Schumacher's apology was sincere though. He still maintains it was all studio interference. This movie is a slap in the face to Batman fans. It eliminates essentially everything people want to see in a Batman film and disgraces the source material with its handling of the characters. You realize the screenwriter for this movie was Akiva Goldsman? The man won an Academy Award for his writing on A BEAUTIFUL MIND. He wrote this. Just some fun food for thought. My main problem with this movie (of many) is its handing of the character of Mr. Freeze. Freeze had the potential to create an incredibly interesting movie. He's a complicated character with a tragic motivation and one of the few villains that can inspire sympathy from an audience because his intentions are somewhat pure. Yes, the Mr. Freeze in BATMAN & ROBIN is still doing what he's doing in hopes of finding a cure for his wife but that whole part feels shoved aside in favor of cold jokes and an embarrassing moment where he's forcing his henchmen to sing along with a Rankin/Bass Christmas tune. Mr. Freeze is wasted and that is the biggest mistake in BATMAN & ROBIN. And don't get me started on Bane. Wow. Mr. Freeze is just wasted but Bane is warped from his comic origins as a criminal mastermind to a mindless hulk that speaks like Frankenstein.There is just so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to put it all into words, especially in a limited space. Let's try and blast through some. Nipples on the batsuit (and Robin suit) make a return. Alicia Silverstone is horribly, horribly miscast as Barbara Wilson/Batgirl. The writing and dialogue in this film is often painful to watch/listen to. The lapses in logic in this film are innumerable. The entire movie is a backwards step to the campiness of the 1960's TV series which, I'm going to argue, would not be a bad thing if they committed to it in full. Drop the serious elements (i.e. Alfred's illness) and better, smarter humor. Satirize the original 60's show. I loved that show and, while it wouldn't be my first choice for a Batman film, I'd be curious to watch a good campy modern Batman movie. The operative word there is ""good"". Where was I? The movie is overlong at two hours; by the time we arrive at the climactic final battle at Gotham Observatory, I've already mentally checked out. Ugh, everything is just handled so poorly. You can tell no one really cared about this movie. Despite all of this, I can still sort of give BATMAN & ROBIN a recommendation. It's not entertaining. It's just confusing. You watch it with a grimace of confusion permanently etched onto your face and, when it's all over, you have to remind yourself that, yes, someone actually made this movie and thought all of the decisions going into it were a good idea.",Batman & Robin
98,Gislef,Mildly entertaining...,2,12 August 1998,"Hey, my five-year old son likes it. Goofy action sequences (does Mr. Freeze _really_ need to fly through the air, and why doesn't he put a leash on that gun?), alternatingly bad sexist, PC, and punning dialogue, and an overshadowed performance by George Clooney add up to not much.  I kinda liked Arnold as Freeze.  However, the character isn't so much a sympathetic villain driven to his crimes, as just schizophrenic.  Uma Thurmann comes closest to capturing the feel of her comic book equivalent, but Alicia Silverstone is just wasted (unless you like looking at her in a rubber, nipple-delineated suit).  But ooh, there's lots of action and noise.",Batman & Robin
99,bkrauser-81-311064,Abhorrently Bad,1,11 May 2016,"Before superhero films became guaranteed box office successes; before they became the huge monoliths of mass media; before they were considered the zenith of popular culture, so many of them varied widely in quality, thus failing to gain traction. The only 90's exception to the rule was Batman, the masked vigilante that prowled the streets of Gotham. In the early nineties, noted filmmaker Tim Burton took a stab at the property, changing the campy aesthetic of the 60's TV series into something a little more contemporary, darker and a little more brooding. Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) still stand as bastions of the era despite their dated special effects. Then, in 1995 something went terribly wrong.Director Joel Schumacher, known for creating the colorful and stylish palettes of Falling Down (1993) and Flatliners (1990) was given a chance to give the Batman universe a makeover. His Batman Forever (1995) baked in the campy ridiculousness of the old Batman (1966-1968) TV series right back into the mix, complete with an appearance by the popular king of 90's comedy Jim Carrey. It worked; thus Schumacher was given the job to create the fourth installment of the film series.Batman & Robin concerns Batman (now played by George Cloney) and Robin's (Chris O'Donnell) quest to track down and stop Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from being a singularly obnoxious ne'er-do- well. Meanwhile in South America, Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) experiments with a strength serum which turns people into super- soldiers. Something goes horribly wrong, turning her and a diminutive prisoner into Poison Ivy and Bane (Robert Swenson) respectively. They make their way to Gotham, team up with Mr. Freeze and plan to destroy the world to create a botanical utopia.Batman & Robin is the equivalent of three day old hamburger cheese that's been bubbling on a plastic bench on a warm summer day. It's unpleasant to look at, it certainly doesn't belong and it encrusts into the mind forcing viewers to look on in disgust; it also really stinks. Everything is wrong with this movie whether it be the simperingly obvious merchandising, it's goofy cardboard characters, it's incredibly cheesy one-liners and abhorrent puns, there's simply nothing to gain from this movie other than unintentional laughter.",Batman & Robin

101,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Despite being one of the most notorious films of all time, ""Batman & Robin"" isn't THAT bad. Wildly flawed, but far from the ""worst movie ever""...",3,11 February 2014,"In the years following it's 1997 release, director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman's ""Batman & Robin"" became something of an icon in the world of blockbuster entertainment. Suffering sometimes incomprehensible mis-judgments on the part of the cast and crew, lame- brained humor and some truly weird visual choices, the film became something of a laughing stock. To the point that star George Clooney even reportedly offered to pay a refund to anyone who saw the film, and director Joel Schumacher issued a number of official apologies.Many have even been so bold as to proclaim it the ""worst film ever.""But let's look beyond the public perception of the film. Let's look beyond the jokes and memes that have come about in subsequent years. Let's look beyond the mythos that has been generated by its release.Is this the ""worst film ever""? No, it's not. By far, it's not. (Case in point, watch ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" or ""Sex Lives of the Potato Men""- both infinitely worse films.)In fact, despite the general consensus, the film actually isn't all bad. There are a few decent aspects to the production, and I can't help but find it a very amusing watch, albeit in an ironic ""so bad, it's good"" sort-of way.The film focuses on the titular Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell), now struggling against villains ""Mr. Freeze"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and ""Poison Ivy"" (Uma Thurman), all while dealing with personal issues, including distrust between them and their ailing butler, Alfred. (Michael Gough) Alicia Silverstone also joins the cast as Barbara, who is destined to become the newest member of the caped crusader's family- Batgirl.Let's be honest- the cast is a mess. Clooney sleepwalks through his performance with the charisma of a raisin. O'Donnell tries, but his role is written as far too whiny, making him come across as unintentionally annoying. Thurman and Schwarzenegger are both wildly over-the-top, making their performances even more cartoonish than the actual Batman cartoons. (They would have felt right at home on the old 60's Adam West series) And similar to Clooney, Silverstone barely seems to try. The only actor who seems to be giving it an honest shot is Gough, who is an absolute delight as Alfred, and steals many of the scenes.The production is also highly flawed. Schumacher has said he was instructed to make a film to sell toys, and that really sums up much of the film. It feels like a 2-hour commercial. Everything is overly simplistic, bright and over-the-top. The script is a bit of a mess. Characters speak practically only in lame catch-phrases and puns. The storyline is silly and non-sensical. And everything is spelled out for the audience at any given point.Schumacher's direction and visual choices are also bizarre. From the infamous ""Bat-nipples"" and ""Bat-Credit-Card"", to the fact that the Batmobile looks like a rolling nightclub, to the fact that Gotham is a highly impractical mass of Greek statues and laser-lights. Everything is so blatant and akin to a cartoon.Yet, at the same time, I cannot condemn the film. Because there are some things that work. Some of the visual designs are fascinating to watch. Elliot Goldenthal's score isn't too bad. A few of the action- beats are kind of fun. And some of the scenes that are played for broad laughs are pretty funny.In addition, the film does have some value as an unintentional comedy. This is a prime example of ""so bad, it's good."" Everything is so far over-the-top and over-done, that you can't help but smirk and chuckle at many of the sequences. From the silly use of ice-related puns by Schwarzenegger to the hilarious set-design and poor practical effects, you won't be able to help but laugh at the film, and to me, that gives it value.As a film on it's own, ""Batman & Robin"" is a pretty-bad 3 out of 10. But for entertainment value, it's a 10. I'd say check it out if you're a fan of bad films.",Batman & Robin

103,shakercoola,$125m of pure pantomime,5,2 April 2018,"An American action film; A story about Batman, a caped crusader, and his sidekick Robin, who take on the villainous Mr Freeze who plans to destroy Gotham City with an icy doomsday weapon unless his demands are met. They also contend with femme fatale Poison Ivy, who is determined to cause trouble between the dynamic duo crimefighters.
This superhero film came in for a bit of a hammering in recent years from some film critics writing retrospectives and compiling lists of 'worst movies ever made'. This one topped one of those lists. I saw it on its theatrical release and came out thinking it was gaudy and meretricious. With the passage of time I find myself assuming the role of witness for the defence because it is in fact better than many films lauded by critics since which rely on overuse of CGI and toe-curling dialogue.
Clooney was well cast as Batman from the outset, delivering on the promise of some well-timed jokes and looking the part of a billionaire playboy philanthropist. Unfortunately, he never seemed to get his teeth into the role. Vibrant Chris O'Donnell, as the vigilante Robin with a partnership problem, fits his part well. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy potently steals the show with her sly menace and staggering voluptuousness, entering the spirit of pantomime wonderfully. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers another character seemingly written for his angular delivery, packed full of comic tropes on the words ice and cold.
In recent years there has been a tendency for fans of the comic book characters to look for provenance and accuracy to what were two dimensional characters in comics. Director Joel Schumacher treats the subject matter honestly and employs pure kitsch fantasy, harking back to the stylisation of the mid-60s TV series.
The budget is mostly up there on the screen in a frenzy of garishness, vibrant colour, action, and bizarre stage sets. Most of the action is in the form of real stunts.
If one enters the spirit of old fashioned British stage pantomime, of baddies being bad baddies with twinkles in their eyes, it is perhaps not the worst couple of hours you've wasted.",Batman & Robin

After a few dark adventure movies for the Batman, this outing moves more towards the kitschy '60's TV series, which never took itself seriously. However, shoddy direction fails to balance the comedic and darker-toned scenes with logical transitions. The result is a sloppy concoction which will leave you with a bad after-taste.Nobody in this marquee cast demonstrates any comedic savvy. Expect tons of mugging, awkward timing, lame scripting, amateurish line delivery, and general indifference by the cast. Many of them strut around in an air of self-satisfied arrogance, proudly displaying their abject contempt for the audience the whole time. Uma Thurman looks even weirder than usual. Governor Ahhhnooollld looks like he was just asphyxiated with laughing gas. Vivica Fox barely phones it in (and apparently her cell phone dropped the call). That guy who played Robin (whatever his name is) looks like he belongs on a kindergarten playground, scooping sand with a toy shovel. Alicia Silverstone acts like a Charlie's Angels reject.Clooney is worst of all. He wouldn't know a Batcave from a hole in the floor. He obviously knows (and/or cares) little about the character.

107,dunmore_ego,From Dark Knight To Boogie Knight,3,10 September 2005,"Why does George Clooney waggle his head like that when he talks?...Robin met Batman when Batman was Val Kilmer. One day he wakes up and Batman is *another* Hollywood Man-Toy, the smug head-waggler Clooney. And Alfred, in seeing no less than three batmen pass through his hallowed Wayne Manor, probably puts it down to his spiraling Alzheimer's It is strangely ironic that the major complaint with this ""Batman"" is that it resembles a comic book  let's all step back from our sophisticated bad selves for a moment, folks Batman IS a comic book. It is doubly ironic that modern comic books exhibit a more cogent view of ""reality"" - since Batman's inception in 1939 - than that which director Schumacher opted to portray in this sophomoric film, which harks back to the inglorious camp of the 1960's TV series, much maligned by aficionados of the ""brooding Batman"" persona.And in camping it up, Schumacher seemed oblivious on where to draw the line: primary colors shriek in anguish and gobos coruscate like an LSD afternoon delight (I assume that the DISCO BALL in the Batmobile's engine means Batman has ""Knight"" Fever-?); humanly impossible feats of acrobatism abound, contravening every physics principle mankind has worked so hard to identify; everyone speaks simply and directly (""Freeze  you're mad!"", ""She's definitely evil!"", ""She loves me and not you, and it's driving you crazy"", ""I was the one who kicked Ivy's butt. Yeh, that was me""  gems, one and all) with lowbrow puns constituting over 80 percent of the egregious dialog; henchmen and policemen as widespread as buffalo on an Oregon plain  and just as dispensably bovine; all that's missing are the ""Kapow's"" and ""Blammo's"" Stupidity runs rampant in this movie, so outlining the plot may seem like an exercise wasted: Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Mr. Freeze (who becomes ""bad"" after falling into a vat of cryogenic solution  er, okay), bewilderingly reaches the conclusion he will find a cure for his frozen wife by flash-freezing Gotham City. Ah, the Republican mind at work: like George W. Bush's plan of furthering education for American children by blowing up Iraqi children. Meanwhile, Uma Thurman (playing Poison Ivy like she's on the brink of constant orgasm) seeks to over-run the planet with her horticulture. With the Rubber-Butted Duo to the rescue...We all know that Arnold can't act  but who knew he couldn't even OVER-act? And Thurman, for all her pining and puling, is a lesson in blandness. That doesn't quell the writers relentlessly plying these two monotone villains with exquisitely-painful puns, eliciting uncomfortable throat-clearing in the stead of guffaws. Place them beside the traffic-stopping vapidness of Chris O'Donnell (Robin) and the plump insipidness of Alicia Silverstone (Batgirl), whose lips look like two oysters doing battle and whose costumed bosom is as unnaturally rounded as Janet Leigh's was unnaturally pointed, and we have a cast as formidable as any ensemble from a ""Police Academy"" stink-bomb.Resembling a comic book is not a crime (illustrated by the superb visualization of Frank Miller's ""Sin City""); insulting our intelligence is what earned Schumacher's Batman the prize in banality. Of the thousands of gaffes that litter the movie, one of the most galling is when Batman shows Freeze incriminating footage of Ivy admitting she was Mrs. Freeze's would-be killer. During that admission, Ivy had dispatched Robin with a gentle push into a two-foot-deep wading pool, Batman was tangled in vines near the ceiling and Ivy was busy kicking Batgirl's portly butt. Yet the Bat-Palm-Pilot simply replays footage FROM THIS MOVIE, not even *trying* to re-create any ""hidden-camera"" authenticity.Insults in no discernible order: an observatory built in the heart of the glaring city (idiotic location choice from the outset  but during the film's climax, it is suddenly atop a million-foot precipice); upon Batgirl's first appearance, she larks at Batman, ""Bruce it's me  Barbara!""  oh, sorry, that meager strip of mask which covers virtually zero percentage of your face had me irretrievably flummoxed; Batman and Robin spending most of the second act feebly arguing over Poison Ivy's attentions, in a vain attempt at dispelling their image as the original Ambiguously Gay Duo; Gotham Telescope crashing to the ground and exploding, obviously due to the vast poundage of explosive material that telescopes are made out of Schumacher  just  didn't  care.When dying Alfred entrusts Silverstone with a ""sacred trust"" DVD for his brother, imploring her never to open it  though it is annoying enough that she immediately *opens it*  upon discovering the secrets of the Bat-Catalog, she apparently assimilates the complete Bat-Crimefighter Protocol in one evening, as she turns up to get her butt kicked by Ivy shortly thereafter, in her XXL Bat-Couture. Then  to further the idiocy  Batman, who for most of the movie has been badgering Robin (the professional acrobat) about being unprepared for battle, nonchalantly allows the out-of-shape college student Batgirl (who has spent just one evening cramming the Batalog into her blond brain) to participate in life-threatening battle with super-villains. Now *that's* a responsible guardian!By the end of the movie, the costuming on the three heroes is so garishly superfluous, so clinically hedonistic, so tastefully atrocious, that it goes way past eye-candy and directly to eye-myocardial-infarction, Clooney's costume neck-bracing him like a stockaded rodeo bull, silver highlights transversely swirling over pecs and quadriceps and Achilles-tendon  one imagines he must feel intoxicatingly liberated when he is free of that constricting cowl, as Bruce Wayne; to dance and sing and compose odes to peripheral vision I guess that's why he waggles his head like that.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Batman & Robin
108,BrandtSponseller,"While I like Batman Forever and Batman Returns better, this is still a great film",8,26 May 2005,"I hate consumer purists. I think purism is ignorant. I also hate sacred cows. I refuse to watch any film, or go into any artwork, with notions of how such and such is ""supposed to be"". If I could write and direct my own Batman film, Batman would be a geriatric transvestite who cuts down villains with a lawn mower. There would be a lot of bloody lawnmower deaths in the film. The batsuit would be a combination of a fur dress with ""real"", huge bat wings and a feminized baseball uniform. Batman would have fangs, eat insects and always sit or sleep upside down. Gotham City would be a small town in Oklahoma and Alfred would be a midget who is older than God and who has a horseshoe fetish. He'd go around naked and barefoot, except he'd have horseshoes on his feet. The Batmobile would be a bicycle. Batman would flap his big, stinky bat wings while he peddles. I'd have a villain who looks like the Penguin but who drives a pick-up truck with a shotgun in the rear window and chews tobacco. He'd spit it out into a bottle, and he'd have a huge collection of bottles in a warehouse full of refrigerators. I'd have a villain like Poison Ivy who dates the Mayor's teenaged daughter. Batman would dance with Poison Ivy and her girlfriend at a hoedown. They'd eat barbecued chicken while they dance, then lick the sauce off of each other's clothes. This wouldn't be intended as a spoof, and it's not that I dislike the Batman character--he's one of my favorite fictional characters.So you can see how director Joel Schumacher's changes to the Batman characters, production design and tone of the film wouldn't put me off of Batman & Robin. I like artists to do things differently, to express themselves. That doesn't mean that I want to make them slaves to the ""cult of originality""--maybe they feel strongly about keeping some or most things ""traditional"", and that's fine. My main requirement is that they do something that they think is artistically valuable. And for me to like what they do, I have to find it interesting, enjoy it, or get something in the way of aesthetic or philosophical worth from it. I definitely find Batman & Robin interesting, I enjoy most of it, and it is very aesthetically pleasing to me. I do think there are a couple flaws. But they're minor enough to only bring my rating down to an 8.Batman (George Clooney) & Robin (Chris O'Donnell) have to battle two villains, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). Mr. Freeze is a scientist who went wacko when his wife acquired a terminal disease and he fell into a vat of cryogenic liquid. His primary ambition is to save his wife's life and make everyone else suffer along with him while he waits by freezing them--literally turning them into big peoplecicles. Poison Ivy is a psycho environmentalist who wants to turn the world back over to plants, but only after she's given plants animal characteristics, so if you try to do any weeding, they'll bite your bummies off. At the same time, Alfred (Michael Gough) is sick, and his hot niece, Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) comes to visit. The film features various scenarios of Batman & Robin trying to capture Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, and alternates this with relationship explorations between Batman, Robin, Alfred and Barbara.For my money, Batman & Robin has the best beginning of any of the Batman films to date. I love the frozen Warner Brothers logo. I love the segue into garish colors that look like Super Elastic Bubble Plastic. I love the sequence of body-part close-ups with the camp and homoerotic factor cranked up to 11. And I love the kick-ass extended action sequence that's as intense as the climax to most films and that features Batman and Robin playing ice hockey and then boogie-boarding on rocket ship parts at 30,000 feet. That just rocks.And things remain at a high level for some time. At least the first half of this film is a solid 10 to me. I'm a fan of George Clooney, and the bizarre casting of him as Batman is a stroke of genius in my book. The only better Batman would have been Tiny Tim, but he died during the production of Batman & Robin, so it's good they didn't cast him. I'm also a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He would have been a good Batman, too, but he's also excellent as Mr. Freeze.I like Gotham City better here than in any of the other films, at least architecturally. Schumacher makes the city huge and gives us constant eye candy. The other Gotham Cities may have had attractive atmospheres, but this one I'm pining to visit. I'd love to explore it. I want to race down that highway. I want to visit that observatory. The production designer, Barbara Ling, shouldn't have just received an Oscar for her work--you should be sending her your firstborn.I love the humor in the film. As I've noted many times, I'm a huge fan of the Adam West ""Batman"" (1966). Schumacher makes a firm commitment to that level of camp in this film. Some scenes here are simply hilarious, like Mr. Freeze yelling at his cronies to sing along with Snow Miser song from The Year Without Santa Claus (1974). Schumacher also does interesting things with the extremely twisted family metaphors of Batman, Robin, Alfred, and Barbara. And I love the colors.In fact, the only real problem I have with this film is that Schumacher slightly loses the plot focus about halfway through. It begins to seem more like a collection of set pieces than a taut story. But the set pieces work (except for some clunkiness in the logic of the climax), and the film is excellent otherwise.",Batman & Robin

Which was my favorite Batman film before Christopher Nolan released his. Everything fell apart in Batman & Robin. The acting was terrible, the set is terrible. The action is terrible. I only give it a 2 do to it's cast. There is so much talent in Batman & Robin that is wasted. The film has a terrible screenplay. Just everything about Batman & Robin is awful. I compare it to Catwoman, which I also gave a 2 because Halle Berry looked good. I hated both films. Batman and Robin isn't quite as terrible as Daredevil. Which, to me, is the worst comic book film ever. Batman & Robin just falls flat in many ways. You'll hate it. I hate it. Luckily, after this film, Christopher Nolan came out with his Batman films, which made up for this garbage. Those films blew all of these films away. Batman & Robin is a dreadful film with an unbearable length of 2 hours and 6 minutes. It doesn't seem long but the film feels like forever. The only highlight of the film is that Uma Thurman looks good. she's awful in the film, but she looks good. Luckily this was the start of George Clooney's career so they didn't give him much trouble. Arnold Swatzenegger's career wasn't that great either at the time. Chris O'Donell... I won't go there. And as for Alicia Silverstone, she gave the worst performance. Batman & Robin will definitely disappoint if you're expecting a lot. You'll either hate it or get turned on by it. Because you see Batman's ass and balls and nipples. Not really, but you see them in a suit. That could be the highlight of the movie, for some people.The Plot: Batman and Robin return once again to face against Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy.

And another thing. I don't know about Schumaucher, but Warner Bros. (the people who own DC comics, publishers of Batman) should know better. They really messed up with the characters. First of all, Barbara is Commissioner Gordon's daughter and not Alfred's niece. Second, Bane is totally screwed up. This is a character that in the comics broke Batman's back but can not strangle Robin and Batgirl. The only really good actor in this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

113,hall895,They killed Batman,3,17 June 2012,"There are certain film franchises which are basically licenses for their studios to print money. It takes a truly wretched movie to kill off one of those franchises. Joel Schumacher did it. He killed Batman. Schumacher's first Batman film, Batman Forever, was an abomination. But Warner Bros. let him make another one. Mistake. Big, huge, giant, franchise-killing mistake. If you thought Schumacher camped it up in the last one wait until you get a load of this. The hideously unfunny puns, the absurdly out of place innuendos, Gotham lit up like a neon amusement park. And nipples. Yes, the Bat-nipples are back. Codpieces too. Schumacher turned Batman into a joke.Val Kilmer was smart enough to steer clear of this mess so we get another new Batman. It's George Clooney this time and he doesn't make much of an impression at all. Sadly that's the nicest thing you can say about any of the film's stars. While Clooney is neither notably good nor notably bad, just kind of there, his costars all fail miserably. First there is the woefully miscast Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Mr. Freeze. Schwarzenegger spends the whole movie spouting some of the worst one-liners ever put to film. There are only so many jokes about ice and cold which can fall flat before you want to start throwing things at the screen. Meanwhile, surrendering every last bit of indie film cred she had accrued, there is Uma Thurman playing Poison Ivy. The character is a total dud and Thurman hams it up to an absurd extent. You want some menace from your villains in a superhero movie? Sorry, you've come to the wrong place. Mr. Freeze is a joke. Poison Ivy is a joke. Everything in this movie is a joke. Which brings us to Chris O'Donnell. Yes, whiny Robin's back but you probably guessed that from the film's title. But for this film one whiny, spoiled brat would-be superhero wasn't nearly enough so Batgirl gets tossed into the mix. Alicia Silverstone mopes her way through the film in that role. If you think her acting is terrible, and it is, just wait until you see her fight. Worst. Fight. Ever. Is there anything nice to say about anyone at all? Well, Michael Gough, playing trusted butler Alfred, is a fine actor and deserves so much better than to be surrounded by so much garbage.In big-budget extravaganzas like this even if the story stinks and the acting stinks and the directing stinks you can usually say, well, at least the effects look great. But alas, in this movie even the effects are terrible. Strictly amateur hour. Apparently the film's entire budget went to Schwarzenegger's and Clooney's salaries. The lame, cheesy effects fit right in with everything else about this debacle of a movie. The script is an atrocity. The action scenes are absurd, often incoherent, and largely just wastes of time. The hockey scene? Ugh. The motorcycle race? Double ugh. Robin yelling ""Cowabunga!"" as he surfs to Earth on the remnants of an exploded rocket? Oh dear God. The only thing which could make this movie worse is if Batman whipped out a Bat-credit card. Oh, he did. Where does the credit card company send the bill I wonder? Does Batman have a P.O. Box? Well now I've really digressed but that's much better than actually continuing to talk about this movie. What's left to say? It's awful, terrible, hideous. Don't ever watch it. There is one legitimately funny thing in the movie though. Unfortunately it's a laugh at the movie, not laugh with the movie type of thing. It comes at the end when the movie tries to set up the next sequel. But we know there would be no next sequel. Because this movie was so bad it did the impossible, it killed Batman. Of course no comic book hero can ever truly die. So let's just go watch the Christopher Nolan movies and pretend this never happened.",Batman & Robin

But top credits go to big Arnie for his winning portrayal of Mr. Freeze, he looks both menacing and powerful. I am of course kidding as he looks frighteningly ridiculous, has some of the most horrible lines ever and a hideous costume. How on earth did this role appeal to him?

115,Beta_Gallinger,As if Joel Schumacher hadn't already done enough to the franchise!,3,8 April 2010,"I remember when this fourth installment in the Warner Bros. Pictures Batman movie franchise, the second of two directed by Joel Schumacher, was released. I remember seeing a trailer for it, which made me interested in seeing it, but I may have been a little too young at the time. I even had a ""Batman & Robin"" poster up in my bedroom for a while in the late 90's. I think it was a birthday present. However, I never actually saw the film until late 2005, after I saw its three predecessors for the first time. At that point, I had just recently learned how terrible it was generally considered to be! From what I remember, I thought it was pretty bad the first time, which was not surprising, and my second viewing (hopefully the last time I ever see this film) was slightly worse! Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are now a crime-fighting duo with their alter egos, Batman and Robin, and there is more trouble on the rise in Gotham City! Mr. Freeze, formerly Dr. Victor Fries, is now a criminal who must remain at sub-zero temperature in order to survive after a terrible accident. He currently has his wife cryogenically frozen until he can find a cure for her disease, MacGregor's Syndrome! Meanwhile, in South America, Pamela Isley works for a scientist named Dr. Jason Woodrue. She sees her boss make a monster named ""Bane"", so the insane scientist kills her, but she comes back to life as an evil, seductive, poisonous plant lover named Poison Ivy! After she kills Woodrue with a toxic kiss, she is lured over to Gotham City knowing that Woodrue's work was funded by Wayne Enterprises, and takes Bane with her. Mr. Freeze intends to freeze over the world, and Poison Ivy has evil plans with her genetically modified plants! She even causes conflict between Batman and Robin with her sexual powers! I don't know what Mr. Freeze is like in the comic books, but in this film, he is one stupid villain played by Arnold Schwarzenegger! It doesn't take long for this to show! Uma Thurman is really pathetic as Pamela Isley, and gets worse when her character becomes Poison Ivy! Even though Dr. Jason Woodrue isn't in the film for long, John Glover's performance in this role is also memorably lame. While Thurman plays Poison Ivy, she does a bad job trying to sound sinister and talk in a different accent. It seems like Thurman actually tried to put on as bad a performance as possible here, and she sure helps make a lot of the movie hard to watch! It doesn't help that Chris O'Donnell is back with his idiotic portrayal of Dick Grayson/Robin, and he may be even worse here than in ""Batman Forever"". Poison Ivy makes Robin fall in love with her, and these two would make a great couple because they're so annoying! It gets so stupid with both Robin's love for Poison Ivy and his love for Barbara Wilson/Batgirl. Most of the performances here are poor, and that certainly isn't the film's only problem. The script is also very weak, with SO many ridiculous lines of dialogue and other severe flaws in the writing that I don't know where to start! They're just too numerous to mention! Joel Schumacher really brought the Batman franchise down in quality with ""Batman Forever"", taking over the directing after Tim Burton directed the first two installments, both of which are entertaining. However, Schumacher polluted it even more with this follow-up, the last one in the series before Christopher Nolan rebooted it in 2005! For some reason, sometime during the last hour, I started to find that I wasn't as disgusted as I had been for the most part, even though the extremely cheesy dialogue keeps coming. The scenes with a seriously ill Alfred Pennyworth generally weren't done so badly, and I guess some of the action is at least half-decent. This is the only reason why I'm giving ""Batman & Robin"" a 3/10 instead of a 2, and I'm not even sure if I should be doing that, with all the atrocious aspects of the movie! A lot of it makes ""Batman Forever"" look like a masterpiece! Unless you insist on watching every movie in the series, I strongly advise you to skip this 1997 stinker.",Batman & Robin
116,vip_ebriega,Dumb in so many levels.,2,29 September 2007,"My Take: Possibly one of the very worst blockbusters of our time. Definitely the worst of the BATMAN movies.After BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS, I thought that Bob Kane's Dark Knight has finally pulled itself out of the bag. But, after seeing BATMAN FOREVER, Joel Schumacher's turn in the series, I think Batman heads back home, to the 1960's campy TV series. But even if that series is campy, they don't come as worse BATMAN & ROBIN. It's not just bad, but also dumb in so many levels. The action was cartoonish, the characters are cardboard, the plot is sticky and everything else is like a big accident too painful to bear. Whereas BATMAN FOREVER wasn't a great film in any respect, it was rather good (I gave it a mild thumbs up) and almost CITIZEN KANE or CASABLANCA compared to this train wreck.Like all superhero hokum, good or bad, the kids will like it. This one is probably the one you should leave the kiddies to watch on their own. It's the easiest of the BATMAN films, less violent and not even touched by any dark, comic tradition. It's like an old cartoon that the kids might fancy. Adults (or perhaps anyone above 10) will no doubt find it a painful experience. Seeing such a great success plunge into complete disaster is definitely something you don't want to witness, for that's exactly what happened in BATMAN & ROBIN.The casting, itself, is big enough to reveal the film's weaknesses. I mean, George Clooney? Batman? With all due respect, isn't Clooney better of with a different film? Oh, come on, Chris O'Donnell, back as Robin? Bad move! Ask for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Uma Thurman as Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, we are better of seeing them in so many other films than this. Michael Gough, however, does give a decent performance as Alfred, but he's rarely used, he's just there to be there, almost like wallpaper.Director Joel Schumacher should really stop making these kind of films because he doesn't know Batman, and perhaps hardly will he ever after totally bashing him in this film. But despite the peak of Schumacher's uninspired direction, it's Akiva Goldsman's half-baked and uncreative script that deserves biggest criticism. Goldsman, an acclaimed action producer and writer, could obviously do better, even with materials that's worth less than a buck.It's perhaps merciful of me to, at least, give this messed-up draft a * rating for at least made me look at the visuals. But I think it hardly save the film, so I hardly call them redeeming qualities.Overall, you can let the kids watch it, but i won't recommend it more than something to keep them steady. it isn't entertainment by a long shot, not even much to the kids. They might like it for a while, but, like clothes, they'll immediately grow out of it.Rating: * out of 5.",Batman & Robin
117,educallejero,Even laughing at it ends up tiresome,1,11 April 2021,"I admit that for a while, I laugh at the insane camp brought by the actors trying to act the sub-human script. But the scenes start to look and sound basically the same, and what was sincere laugh, ends up as infuriating exhaustion.Every aspect of the filmmaking in this garbage is just a demonstration of absolute incompetence or absolute corruption and robbery by the director (there is no argument to be made for the writer, a ""literal"" thief).So, yeah Joel, about those apologies...",Batman & Robin
118,Stampsfightclub,"Bad acting, script and design but occasionally engaging",5,21 March 2009,"Batman (Clooney) and Robin (O'Donnell) try to catch the ice man Mr Freeze (Schwarzenegger) whilst trying to trust each other.The forth Batman film in almost a decade brought about a new Batman in the form of George Clooney (Syriana) and the return of Joel Schumacher for his follow up to the successful Batman Forever. Schumacher's first shot at the Batman was to take away the darkness of Tim Burton's genius and use the story and action in an easy approachable viewing for the entire family and whereas this is appropriate to generate profits and make it more accessible for anyone, it takes away the darkness and imagination of Burton's first two smashes and ultimately leaves the film awkward, unappreciative of realism and lacking a killer thrust, much like his 1997 picture.Like his previous adaptation of the comic book, Schumacher uses two villains in this picture, Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy. Using more than one villain can work as evident with The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 3. So cast excellent menacing looking Schwarzenegger and manipulative Thurman for two vindictive and demoralizing villains and you have a film, well sort of.Never have Batman villains ever been so dull and predictable. Flat, boring and ordinary there is nothing to separate them and though obviously poor it is down to a script so woeful it is almost laughable.The characters are addressing the audience rather than the other protagonists in the scene. They are explaining every single little thing, as if we are dumb enough not to comprehend and so, we are left with some exceptionally awkward dialogue and sickly moments in the context of a film that tries to preach about trust, honour and disease.The costumes are as comic as the ridiculous script with the depiction of Gotham equally far-fetched. What is disappointing also is the fact that solutions to problems seem so easy. The weapons, gadgets and vehicles just seem so obvious and yet so unrealistic. They are as cheesy as Robin's continuous catchphrases.However despite the bad reviews and criticism this film has received it is not all doom and gloom. Clooney is an interesting Batman, there are some finely choreographed fights, (a few not all) and there is a fine bike racing montage that is to watch out for. The Alfred sub story is also quite touching.But these are almost forgettable once the ending roles around and you are left with memories of a film that justifies the family viewing tag with some action figures who explain everything for you, some ridiculous costumes and a plot that is simply paper thin",Batman & Robin
119,Mister-6,It's a good kind of bad...,3,1 August 1999,"Batman - great.Batman Returns- bad.Batman Forever - very entertaining.Batman and Robin - ??????Kind of in a quandary here.  What can you say about a movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink in the name of entertainment...then forgets the story?This is the kind of eye candy that will rot out your retinas:huge sets, sprawling set design, wild chases, big explosions, plummeting drops, g-force ascents, hulking villains.  Everything you could ever expect in your average comic book.This much I must say - this is one of the few movies that color-codes its characters.  You've seen it in the posters - dark blue for Batman, ice blue for Mr. Freeze, red for Robin, green for Poison Ivy, purple for Batgirl. Whenever you see the set decorated with any one of these main colors, you can pretty much depend on that particular character being in the immediate vicinity.Not a bad idea when none of the characters have as much personality as your average box of crayons.Okay, here's where it gets bad.  George Clooney has more expressive qualities with the cowl on than off.  To compensate, Chris O'Donnell's face runs the gamut of expressions from A to T (maybe U or V).  Other than that, the good guys grin a lot, the bad guys grimace and scowl (or smirk in Uma Thurman's instance), But there's not much else in the way of acting or emoting (except maybe for Arnie: ""Ahm afraid my preh-zint kahn-dition hahz left me 'kahld' to your pleas for mehr-cee!"" -you'll have to see that one for yourself).Then, there's the story.  Three words can describe it - sprawling, skittish and stupid.  It gets about as deep as a dinner plate in spots then when it can't think of anything else to do, throws in a few special effects.Or in this movie's case, the ""saving grace"" effects.For a movie with wall-to-wall effects of people freezing, being poisoned, morphing into hulking beasts, and zooming through the streets in cars, bikes and every other transportaition device known to man at top speed (I don't think ANYONE drives the speed limit in this movie), the effects pick up the pace in many places where there would be a resounding thud otherwise.When all is said and done, ""Batman and Robin"" is entertaining in a ""wow, did you see that"" way.  Just don't expect to hear this movie and the words ""intellectual property"" in the same sentence.Eight stars...minus three for story incontinuities, slow spots and loose threads...and two more for casting George Clooney in a role where he looks like he'd rather be in his ""ER"" threads.  Altogether, three stars.There's supposed to be another ""Batman"" movie in the works.  HOLY MERCHANDISING OPPORTUNITY!Maybe next time, there'll be a story.",Batman & Robin
120,The_Movie_Cat,A pain in the ice.,3,15 October 2000,"Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?Yes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.The lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman ""Batunbuuurg"", refers to Robin as ""Buuurd Bouy"" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word ""ice"" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman ""Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola"" the urge to use the video's ""stop"" button is almost insurmountable.Bane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her ""garden needs tending"" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - ""I'll help you grab your rocks"" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: ""I never leave the cave without it""; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. ""It's the hockey team from Hell""; ""So this is where you hang out""; ""I'll cancel the pizza""; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. ""Not all heroes wear masks""; ""to give life... that's true power"". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with ""failures"" like that?",Batman & Robin
121,fernandoschiavi,Practically nothing is saved in this cinematic disaster of the Dark Knight in theaters worldwide,4,8 August 2015,"Despite much criticism, the film's previous films, yielded good numbers to the pockets of executives from Warner and it made Warner put Batman & Robin in accelerated production, to be released in less than two years after the third film. Schumacher then got excited and with the departure of Tim Burton production, with the permanence only Peter Macgregor-Scott, more colors, more main characters, close-ups of the actors in the genitals, nipples and genital protectors and advantaged were back in an even more exaggerated Gotham.Again under the direction of Joel Schumacher, he had a mission here to create a family adventure most, and had behind an industry of marketing that would profit from the film. Schumacher accepted command that machine profit of Hollywood and received severe criticism in his worst work in theaters. There was so much publicity and anticipation surrounding this film that the public wanted nothing less than what was promised in the advertisements. Since Val Kilmer cannot accept the invitation to return, the producers then had to run behind a Batman, the third in four films. And George Clooney accepted the challenge. About the story, Batman and Robin have to fight this time the Mr. Freeze, alter-ego of scientist Victor Fries, who after an accident in his laboratory cryogenics becomes dependent on a costume that keeps temperatures below zero and is fulled for diamonds, and Dr. Pamela Isley, who would become the Poison Ivy, after suffering an accident in which toxins were injected into his body. The villains unite to destroy the dynamic duo that will still have to deal with yet another villain, Bane allied himself to the Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger)and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). Meanwhile, Alfred is ill and friendship of the duo is put to the test by a lack of confidence when they are in action.In this version of Joel Schumacher, Bane is interpreted by the professional fighter Jeep Swenson, who died shortly after the film's release. Swenson, in fact, only lends his physique to give grandeur to the strength of character, but that was done by the production team with this character is ridiculous. Bane is treated almost as a ""pet"" and ""henchman"" of Poison Ivy, Bane is treated as a being without any intelligence nd not speak a single sentence the whole movie, The characterization of the character is also totally artificial, where it appears all green, but looking like the Hulk Marvel than with the person who defeated Batman in comics. Mr. Freeze, as said, is basically a bald Schwarzenegger painted bright blue. Thurman Poison Ivy does seem crazy, and Bane was outraged by the creators of the film. But the protagonists are not so far behind the villains. George Clooney is the most ham all the Batmans, and who criticized Michael Keaton had to wish back the actor after seeing this movie. Robin Chris O 'Donnell still annoying and unbearable to the extreme, making it impossible to sympathize with her spoiled way, that your partner is jealous of Batman and who wants to be independent. Their fights with their partner and children are sound with a stunning artificiality. Alicia Silverstone went on adventure to be Batgirl. And his character is also a joke aside for a number of reasons. With the idea of making a film more family and fun, the producers had to recruit someone younger, appealing to the young audience at the time, and she is there for this very reason - to be a superhero strong that attract girls to film and of course the boys drooling by the beauty of Alicia - since her participation is unnecessary and misguided. The script is pathetic. The entire film is permeated by attempts at humor that mostly generate shame so embarrassing. Bat slip on tail dinosaur, Bruce Flintstone? Sky-surfing Cowabanga '. Surfing in heaven is an awkward moment, just as the bat-skates that appeared out of nowhere. Nothing like having bat-skates to play ice hockey with his enemies. The scene also includes choreography, spins and twirls make any circus jealous. In the first minutes of the film, before the aforementioned scenes of ice hockey in the Gotham Museum, we see close-ups four: two on the genitals and buttocks of two heroes. And later in the film we see two more with Batgirl when she wears the uniform for the first time. Schumacher once again decided to change the uniforms of the heroes.The soundtrack composed by Elliot Goldenthal again holds the same job deleted and only correct previous film, not even remotely have the brilliance of Danny Elfman in the works of Tim Burton. Already the songs are bad or out of context, to make the film more pop. Are present ""The End is the Beginning is the End"" performed by Smashing Pumpkins, and ""Revolution"" by REM, for example.Many problems were gathered in two hours long and gives chills just remembering this great error. Fortunately the audience reacted as expected and yielded to the coffers of Warner only $ 238 million, having cost $ 125 million. Joel Schumacher, years later, said he had been invited by the studio for a fifth movie that would be shown the Scarecrow, but he said that after he saw the result of this fourth film, could not accept the invitation, and just recognizing his mistake this work and apologized to all the fans for Batman & Robin.Batman would not be back to have another chance at the movies when all forget this latest fiasco in the hands of one of the most brilliant directors and stock of recent times, Christpher Nolan, with his unique vision and apocalyptic character. After him, no comparisons with predecessors and can hardly be surpassed in future adaptations of the Nolan's Dark Knight. managed to score himself a visual style with complex and realistic screenplays like none other had accomplished before.",Batman & Robin
122,aesgaard41,Not Clooney's Fault !,7,13 November 2000,"I have always thought that George Clooney looked more like the comic book Bruce Wayne more than Adam West or Michael Keaton. Given the right script and the right direction,he could have played the Caped Crusader just as dark as Keaton,much more straight than West and a heck of a lot better than Kilmer !! If I was to lay the blame for this fiasco on anyone's feet, it would be straight at Uma Thurman. Whoever told her she was good-looking ? Whoever told her she could act ? Poison Ivy is supposed to be played regally,haughty and earth-conscious - not stupid,obnoxious and idioticly.She is a car crash as a would-be comic book come to life.The role could have gone to Emma Samms,Markie Post or even Roma Downey.Part of the blame may have to rest at Alicia Siverstone's feet.Her costume,much like everyone else's, is too over the top and should have looked a bit more aesthetic.

Joel Schumacher, who created a more colorful version of the Dark Knight in Batman Forever (which wasn't a bad thing in that film, though I will always favor Tim Burton's Gothic and dark version in the first two films), really missed the mark here - for instance, the acting was miscast (George Clooney is an okay Batman, and Arnold Schwarzenegger was highly miscast as Mr. Freeze - the role really should have gone to Patrick Stewart), the story was utterly stupid, and yet again, there's no character development for Batman/Bruce Wayne (we will have to wait yet one more time for 2005's Batman Begins to FINALLY understand Bruce Wayne and his past).

125,bellino-angelo2014,"Hands down, the worst Batman movie ever made",3,16 February 2020,"BATMAN & ROBIN has a reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made. It's currently #68 in the Bottom 100, it has a score of 3,5 and for many this is the movie that killed comic book movies for a while (along with STEEL starring Shaquille O'Neal that came out in the same period). After I saw a while ago I could understand why everyone hates this movie and many of the rumours are right, but strangely enough, despite being a horrible movie it managed to earn about the cost... making it one of the highest grossing movies of the year. Unfortunately the Batman franchise was killed and it was only revived in 2005 with BATMAN BEGINS with Christian Bale.When the movie begins, it can be seen clearly why this movie bombed. It looks more cartoony and brightly colored compared to 1989's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS. It looked like the director only saw the old and campy 1960s TV show and put it in a modern contest. And I can only imagine audiences in theaters enraged with the sight of a beloved franchise dumbed down in a cartoonish version. And at times there are even the sound effects from the old TV show.The acting is atrocious by everyone. George Clooney, despite being a good actor, is too good looking and charming for the role of the Dark Knight. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy overacted terribly through most of the movie, despite being also very seductive. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze comes off as the most laughable member of the cast, giving terrible ice-related puns every few seconds. But the worst performers in the cast are Chris O'Donnell as Robin and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. O'Donnell is whiny to the point of annoying and is so grating on the nerves, while Silverstone is very bland and emotionless throughout the movie (and it's no wonder that this movie killed both their careers).If Joel Schumacher wanted to make a good movie he should have learned lots of things from 1989's BATMAN. It should have been darker, with only one good villain instead of three lousy ones and with more effective acting. Instead it looks like it was filmed in a carnival house, with lots of colourful sets and funfair-like objects (especially in Mr. Freeze's HQ).Overall, a truly wretched and dull movie. It manages to earn a 3, but only because of the sets and also because if given a better director and a better script, it could have been better.",Batman & Robin

I usually save 1-star ratings for movies that have ""Barbarian"" or ""Stewardess"" in the title. One star means the movie uses spaghetti to simulate entrails and spends most of their budget on fake blood. One star is reserved for films that make no sense, have incredibly bad actors and that change directors halfway through the script.So Batman and Robin is unique in that it earned a 1-star rating without any of those things in place.

131,Prichards12345,"""You no send me to da cooler!""",1,6 June 2011,"Good ol' Arnie! He can't act his way out of a paper bag and yet with the exception of Michael Gough he's still the best performer in this film, which is one of the grand turkeys of the last 20 years or so. So let's assess this startling dose of realism....Dayglow street gangs? Yeah, I have to pass 'em on my way home from work every evening.Gay subtext? Not exactly - it's so obvious it sticks out like Batman's rather hilarious nipples and codpiece combo. A friend of mine refuses to use the proper title of this film and refers to it as ""Batman Loves Robin."" 12 million special effects shots? Yep. As headache inducing as you could wish for. Story? Poison Ivy wants revenge on a Tim Burton look-a-like who tried to kill her. Wasn't done in Batman Returns at all, no siree....Mr. Freeze (the immortal Arnie) in his day-glow light-up Buzz Lightyear suit wants to rob lots of diamonds the size of your fist to bring his wife out of suspended animation, or something. Pity he didn't try it on the rest of the cast...Bane. No hang, on lets get this right. BAAAANNNNNNE! Lovely! Imagine the actor who got the part reading the script - ""What, is that all I gotta say. Well, I'll just have to give it some welly to get noticed.""...Somewhere in all this is the rather touching idea of Alfred dying from an incurable illness but carrying on as if nothing's wrong. If only the bulk of the movie had been about this...Robin fights with Batman. Not physically, unfortunately, as I'd love to see the smug little toe-rag get his ass well and truly kicked. Michael Jackson would have made a more convincing boy wonder than Chris O'Donnell...as would Elvis. Ah, where is he now???? O'Donnell I mean, not Jackson or the King! Ah, yes, Uma Thurman as Ivy almost lures him to his doom. Remember when she used to have a career in films like Pulp Fiction? Luckily Tarantino rescued her in Kill Bill or it would have ended here. Pronto! Wayyy! Spice Girl power is present with Batgirl! Racing against said Dayglow street gangs for kicks. Did I mention there's plenty of Dayglow in this film?? Mr. Freeze's super freezing ray immobilises a dog taking a leak against a fire hydrant. Bet that got Oscar Wilde worried.George Clooney's non-performance is a wonder to behold; sleeping walking should be made a criminal offence considering the money some stars get paid. Mr. Clooney has gone on to much better things. In honesty I still prefer Adam West to any of the first 3 Batmen! He played it 98% straight with just a twinkle in his eye.A complete embarrassment that almost killed off the Batman franchise. Thank God for Chris Nolan! This one looks like it was done by Ed Wood on a 300 million budget....",Batman & Robin
132,Hayden-86055,Extremely corny and unfunny film,1,26 November 2020,"My God what a terrible end to a franchise, George Clooney plays one of his worst roles ever here as Batman and his two sidekicks Robin and Batgirl (Chris O'Donnell + Alicia Silverstone) are so cringe-inducing and boring I wanted to cry. It's such a shame seeing Michael Gough and Uma Thurman in this as they could have actually been quite good with a decent script. Oh, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze is one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a Superhero film, his jokes are like Dad jokes but 100 times worse.The storyline is very poor, Poison Ivy and Mr Freeze team up to turn the world into a giant jungle and freeze it over. Despite their goals being completely different that doesn't stop this uncharismatic partnership flourishing.The cinematography isn't fun enough to be campy, nor dark enough for Tim Burton, it's a weird blend and comes out looking terrible.1/10: Absolutely do not watch this unless you want to see how bad it is",Batman & Robin
133,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,3,9 February 2010,"In order to cash in while Batman was still hot, a fourth installment was whipped up with plenty of campy dialogue, corny action sequences and lazy story lines to criticize a decade later. Even the title of the film itself couldn't be more unoriginal. Clooney replaces Kilmer who replaced Keaton — couldn't you tell this was a lost cause? Schwarzenegger gets top billing (à la Nicholson in the original), but the interesting casting and live-action adaptation of Mr. Freeze is too laughable and unrealistic to even deserve the slightest compliment. Even the rest of the all-star cast, especially Thurman as Poison Ivy, is too unbearable to watch. Schumacher has even gone on record to apologize for this disaster of a film, acknowledging that an extra year would've made a huge difference — and his self-awareness earns him some sympathy. Just look, each of the previous Batman films had a three year gap between except this one. It was rushed probably due to greed. This is what happens when greed takes over an art form, and watching as the film crumbled one horrible scene after another is somewhat satisfying because you're watching a money-hungry production plummet.*½ (out of four)",Batman & Robin

135,DarthVoorhees,"Absolutely Ridiculous,",4,16 May 2012,"'Batman & Robin' is the film everyone loves to hate. And it is a real turkey in a great many ways to the point where it really becomes like shooting fish in a barrel trying to criticize it's many flaws. I've seen it a few times, many of which came as a child who was totally sucked in by Warner Bros blatant commercialism butchering of the Dark Knight and a few times as an adult looking for a film to troll. Is 'Batman & Robin' terrible? After a recent viewing I don't know if the answer is quite simple anymore. The film is unbelievably stupid and yet I found that I actually admire the scope of it in some ironic ways. It goes without saying that 'Batman & Robin' is an absolutely ridiculous film and yet in a great many ways the comic book is all about the quality of being ridiculous. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Clooney is a monotone and frankly boring Batman. O'Donnell's Robin is a whiny one dimensional character with no sort of character arch. Uma Thurman doesn't just chew the scenery, she gobbles it. Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl is a ten year old boy's definition of being a feminist woman.And there's Arnie...'Batman & Robin' is a horrendous adaptation of the source material, this goes without saying. They completely got Batman and his motivations wrong. The thing is though I don't think any of the Burton/Schumacher films came close to getting Batman right at all. I hate all four original Batman films as Batman adaptations. In fact I would say Joel Schumacher deserves a fair degree of credit for working with Val Kilmer in creating a really interesting Bruce Wayne in 'Forever'. 'Batman & Robin' has been a target for years and yet the criticism of the film has evolved. This idea of it being a horrible Batman adaptation is correct and yet this same criticism can be applied to Burton's films which for the lack of a really deep Batman film were heralded as masterful explorations of the character before Nolan came along. One must completely throw the gripes of adapting Batman out the window before viewing any of these films because obviously you are going to find flaws. It just so happens that these flaws are all the more apparent in this film and they are very angering to a Batman fan. The fact that the fans put Warner's feet to the fire after this is really a testament to how brilliant Batman is. In order to critically look at 'Batman & Robin' one must accept that the film will inevitably fail to be Batman.I've asked a great deal of you and if you are still here with me let me try to explain what I feel works about 'Batman & Robin' because there is stuff that work here. One person I do not wish to be as venomous with is Joel Schumacher, whom i actually think does the best with the horrible cards he has been given. Granted Schumacher could have done a great deal more in curbing the horrendous excess of his performers and yet that aside I think 'Batman & Robin' is a competently and dare I say well made film. 'Batman & Robin' is a ridiculous set piece and Batman myths aside I enjoyed a great deal of the action here. I actually think Schumacher can direct an effective action film. He has an epic vision of a bizarre Gotham City and he stretches that budget to all he can get from it. The film is much more visually appealing to look at than any recent main stream action film (anything Bay makes comes to mind). The art direction is absolutely beautiful and captures the feel of a ridiculous comic book perfectly. Contrary to popular belief comic books have been and will continue to be ridiculous. So did I like 'Batman & Robin'? No, I hated it for pretty much all the same reasons everyone loves to hate it for. Do I think it is an unredeemable film? Far from it. There is a degree of creativity and imagination here on Schumacher's part that although wasted on a script this horrible is evident and to a certain degree fun.",Batman & Robin
136,Darkside-Reviewer,"What almost killed the Batman franchise? ""The Ice Age!""",5,2 June 2020,"I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.The first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.This movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.I love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.This movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun.",Batman & Robin
137,bigverybadtom,I Fell Asleep During The Movie,1,2 September 2013,"My girlfriend got this as a gift, and we watched it together one evening. I fell asleep while watching it, and though my girlfriend presumably did not, she indicated not liking this either.What was wrong with it? Everything. ""Batman"" may supposed to be dark, but there was too much darkness in this one. Contrast does help keep one's interest, and Batman doesn't absolutely require darkness to be successful, as you might guess if you've seen the other movies, comics, etc.The heroes are bad. The interaction between the title characters doesn't come off properly. The villains are worse. The police tell Batman about the new villain, Mr. Freeze. (Huh? Batman is supposed to be the great detective who knows everything before anyone else does!) And Arnold Schwarzenegger was as suitable for the character as Danny DeVito would be to play Marilyn Monroe. The female villain stinks too.It's hard to describe more; I fell asleep because everything was done so badly. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone wasn't sleeping themselves when they were making this movie.",Batman & Robin
138,gigan-92,You bastards,1,10 November 2010,"What was the look upon the faces of the cast and crew when they finally finished production on this movie? Did Joel Schumaer smile to himself? Yes, I did it! I have successfully killed off the Batman franchise! Did our writer Akiva Goldsman consider silently praying to Bob Kane for forgiveness? Please, Mr. Kane, forgive me! I was so high! Did each and every one of the actors wince every second while watching their 'performances'? Cringe at every line of hideous and inexcusable dialogue? Oh God, what have we done? And as our distributors looked down at the filth ridden crap, all they can say aloud to another is, ""Well, Schuamer will never touch Batman again, but at least we'll sell lots and lots of toys."" To say I was disappointed when I first saw it is an understatement. It's more on the lines of severely depressed for a few days. Several good actors, George Clooney, Uma Thurman, but they play down to our director's level to the extreme. They couldn't have possibly looked at the script and not had any complaints. Uma Thurman of ""Pulp Fiction"" of all people, who I had high hopes for. Come on, we had three of my favorite villains in one movie, but the delivery couldn't have been more sh*tty. Arnold as Mr. Freeze?! Holy Mother of God you cannot be serious. The guy has roles he was undeniably mean t to play, but this was not one of them. For once while reviewing a film, I have not a single positive note to add. So, with that said, how in God's name does this movie have as high a rating as it does? It's hardly sufficient, the positive reviews could only be the work of fans of the Adam West Batman. How, though, seeing as the dialogue and every aspect of it was so painful to watch I don't see how anyone in their right mind could like it.",Batman & Robin
139,sashank_kini-1,I'd rather watch my dogs poop for two hours!,2,14 January 2009,"I'm very lucky to have watched this on the DVD and pray for those poor should who had to suffer unbearable pain while watching this on the big screen. This movie is an insult to humanity. Its is so bad that it is horrible, completely shattering the saying 'So bad, its good'.I have never seen such horrible acting in my life from such highly regarded actors, who gave their worst performances ever. The beginning of the movie was cheesy with Robin complaining over the fact that his name was not Bat. Arnold gave such a terrible performance with his unbearable one-liners such as 'Is the party over?' etc (They're probably in millions). Uma Thurman was extremely lovable in Kill Bill but in this movie, I felt to strangulate her. Her overacting and her unbearable dialogue delivery, which according to her, was her way to charm men, couldn't just do anything. I do not blame Freeze when he told that he would make life hell for her.George Clooney or rather Clowny too was horrible. He was smiling, smiling and smiling. He even smiled in emotional scenes and in scenes where he had to appear angry. I was surprised that he lost the award for Worst Actor in Razzie Awards.Robin, as I have mentioned before, was pathetic. His jealousy was laughable and all his frustration got me frustrated to ponder upon the fact that why, for the sake of God, am I watching this crap of a movie!The actress who won for Worst supporting actress deserved the award for being so annoying and having an odd shaped mouth whenever she talked. There are so many bad puns and dialogues which can irk almost anyone. The action too doesn't help and rather sabotages the film. The humor is unfunny. Alfred too was very annoying in this movie. A 2 out of ten for his piece of crap. And oh yes, the mad scientist was probably the worst mad scientist out of the list of mad scientists.",Batman & Robin
140,griffolyon12,Holy Batnipples!,2,13 March 2009,"Batman & Robin is by far one of the worst films of all-time. It's a movie that has no real redeeming facts. George Clooney is horribly miscast as the Dark Knight, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is over-the-top and cheesy as the villainous Mr. Freeze. Where the previous Bat-film Batman Forever had this odd charm about its over-the-top nature, Batman & Robin has no charm whatsoever. The tried comedy just seems forced and not needed, and the action is so painstakingly corny that it is hard to watch the many action sequences within this film; one sequence in particular is the horrid sequence of Batman and Robin riding air surfboards to chase Mr. Freeze down to Earth from a rocket. It's just so overdone, and the story is so lackluster that it can't keep your interest despite the cheesy jokes and corny action. Overall this was a film that seems as if it was made simply so the studio could cash in on merchandising and nothing else. This is truly one of the worst superhero films ever made.I give Batman & Robin a 2 out of 10!",Batman & Robin
141,mahmus,So bad it's good,2,15 May 2020,"A ton of fun to watch and laugh at it.Arnold is either having the time of his life or suffering through the worst experience ever and either way I love him in this.This movie's bad. Really bad. But so glad it exists.

142,Maniac-9,Movie making at its worst,1,6 August 1998,"Exactly what was the point of this movie, to sell more Batman toys.  The people in charge of the movie were more concerned with making new and cool Bat outfits.  It sure wasn't put out to break some new ground in movie making.  All the characters are one-dimensional and phony.  Was there any real dialogue in this movie or was it just a bunch of catchy one-liners.  I can't think of a single performance in this movie that wasn't just down right weak.  The first two Batman movies the ones made by Tim Burton are so much better than the recent installments by Joel Schumacher.  It seems Schumacher is trying to make a live action cartoon or something.  When everyone knows that the darker Batman in the Batman Dark Knight comics is the coolest version of Batman.",Batman & Robin
143,rossrobinson,good,10,28 March 2004,"I did enjoy Batman and Robin but i must say i don't think it's the best. I would think that Batman Returns is the best, i don't know what the others would think, proberly others would think that the orignial movies, Batman, the one with the joker would be the best, or Batman Returns with the Penguin and Catwoman (Danny De Vito and Michelle Pheiffer), or Batman Forever with the guy with 2 faces (Tommy Lee Jones), or Batman and Robin with the Mr Freeze Guy (Arnold Swargnegger). I would say and think that Michael Keaton played the best batman than the other actors (Val Kulmar and George Clooney) because he was the first to star in the movie. Val Kulmer was not too bad, and George Clooney would be the least best. I give batman and robin 7 out of 10 because i think it's not a bad movie.",Batman & Robin
144,Min111,Batman 4,3,17 December 2019,"I received the video (Batman & Robin) back in the nineties, and I'd watch the movie every time even though I found it boring with every viewing. I also had the action figures of these superheroes, so I was really excited for the movie initially. It's clearly the worse 'Batman' movie. I really wanted the movie to be good as I had high expectations considering the cast. You had popular actors and actresses in the movie such as Alicia Silverstone (Batgirl), Arnold Schwarzenegger (Mr Freeze) and George Clooney (Batman). These are three of my very favourites. I wasn't too disappointed that 'Batman' was played by another new character. I actually think George Clooney is a good 'Batman'. He was excellent in the movie. I don't understand why George Clooney isn't in more action and superhero movies. He looks suited to such roles in my eyes. Yes, 'Batman & Robin' is a direct sequel to 'Batman Forever', and is the fourth movie in the series. In other words, it's basically 'Batman 4'. What I liked the most regarding the movie is that the movie introduces us with three new 'Batman' enemies: Bane, Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy. I liked how 'Batman' and 'Robin' were fighting over Poison Ivy. I don't blame them considering how attractive and beautiful she is. I liked how easily she was able to seduce them. I really liked the part where 'Batman' uses his credit card. I found that hilarious! He's a billionaire, so he can afford practically anything. I didn't like the suits the three superheroes were wearing. They didn't look good in them. I also didn't like Bane in the movie. He's drastically different to the Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. He was an utter joke in 'Batman & Robin'. Don't you think so? I did like Mr Freeze who practically freezes everything. I think another good name for Mr Freeze is Iceman. I think you should know that there's also another Mr Freeze movie which is an animated movie. I really liked the Batmobile in 'Batman & Robin'. The Batmobile looks really cool, and I think it's one of the best out of every 'Batman' movie in my opinion. In fact, I even use to own one, and played with it as a kid. Even though 'Batman & Robin' is the worse 'Batman' movie ever, I still watch it from time to time. It's probably one of the greatest worse movies to watch. You should see the overall rating this movie has received on here. I'm not the only one who didn't like 'Batman & Robin'. It's nice to have company. The movie also received more than a 1,000 reviews here too which I've read many of course.",Batman & Robin
145,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,2 August 2021,"I agree with all the criticisms made. As I see it, there are good ideas and situations in the film. There is the appearance of Batgirl - very well played by Alicia Silverstone, although also very poorly used, in my opinion. Chris O'Donnell lends Robin a figure - at the very least - visually interesting. Poison Ivy appears for the first time. However, actors are very poorly exploited in their potential. Arnold Schwarzenegger is in beautiful makeup, but his character could have been better characterized in addition to the Mr. Freeze look. There are a lot of ridiculous and unnecessary accents. The problem Schumacher wanted to make a dark movie but Warner didn't want it to be, and wanted exactly to sell toys. Some moments were extremely cliché and jokes, to the point of ridiculing the production itself.Film viewed on the 1st to the 2nd of August 2021.",Batman & Robin
146,vampyrecowboy,Seriously horrible,2,31 August 2009,"This is what is wrong with Hollywood.Making horrible movies that offer little or no entertainment.Like most of the other Batman movies before and after, this is a POS.A big budget and big names does not mean it will be a good movie by any standards.Sometimes cutting down the budget and names is actually a good thing.This was so bad that I should have been all drugged up when watching this - after all, I believe that this entire movie was about drugs in it's sub-context.The leafy greens = marijuana.The chemicals = steroids.The ice - crack cocaine.Sex, drugs and violence in a cartoon fashion makes this a low level Hollywood dismal failure from the opening scene to the closing.Horrible on so many levels.",Batman & Robin
147,LebowskiT1000,Something went wrong with this one.,7,19 November 2002,"For years now I actually defended this film, thinking it wasn't all that bad.  A few weeks ago I decided that I wanted to watch all of the Batman films in order.  So, I just finished watching ""Batman & Robin"".  I have to say that this truly is a terrible film.  Well, maybe not terrible, just not what the fans were expecting and definitely not what the fans wanted to see. If you are an 8 year old, this is actually a pretty good movie, but if not, this might be painful.I'm sure there are a number of people to blame here, but I'm going to put the blame on Joel Schumacher.  What happened???  Joel is a very good director, he's had some amazing films, even his previous Batman film was pretty good.  I think Joel just didn't want to take the film seriously, as I'm sure is a problem with a lot of people, but why on earth did he agree to direct another Batman film is he wasn't going to take it seriously? Granted, it's a comic book film, so it's a little hard to take it seriously, but what I mean is that he shouldn't have made it so campy.It's sad that you have a film full of so many big names and it still doesn't work.  I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of George Clooney, he's ok, but nothing great.  He did ok with the role, but in all honesty, I don't think he should have been cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Chris O'Donnell did a fine job, not perfect, but good.  Alicia Silverstone did a find job as well (and looked perfect), but I really don't think her character should have been added to the picture...a little too much.  A great deal of people are continually bashing Arnold Schwarzenegger for his portrayal of Mr. Freeze.  Ok, well he wouldn't have been my first choice as Mr. Freeze either, but I thought he did a great job with the role.  And the make up effects on him were excellent, as was his suit that he wore.  I thought Arnold was a pleasant surprise in the film.  Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy on the other hand, was a MAJOR disappointment.  Uma did a decent job, but the dialogue and the character was just HORRIBLE!!!  They should have just eliminated her character from the film.  Her character was SO uninteresting and just plain boring!  What were they thinking with Bane?  Bane was so useless in the film!  He was no more than a useless henchman throughout the film.  Michael Gough did a great job with his role though, as expected.  Pat Hingle was just fine as Commissioner Gordon.  And finally, I have to mention Elle Macpherson.  What the heck was her character doing in the story?  STUPID!!! I like Elle as much as the next guy, but her character was beyond useless.Contrary to some people, I thought the special effects were pretty cool and quite well done throughout the film.  Ok, there were a few cases where Mr. Freeze's Ice looked rather fake and plastic, but overall, I thought it was pretty well done.As for the super hero/villain outfits, I thought they were ok.  Batman sometimes looked cool, and sometimes looked god-awful (what happened to solid black suit in the original?).  Robin had a cool look throughout the film (loose the nipples on the suit though).  Mr. Freeze looked really cool in the film, a very nice touch.  Poison Ivy looked good, the outfit was nothing to complain about.  Batgirl looked pretty good (except when she had on the cap with bat ears and all).  Bane looked ok, not too much to complain about there.The last thing I have to mention is the Batmobile.  GOOD GOD!!!  This is the stupidest vehicle designed in any of the films, NO CONTEST!!!  What the heck is with that enormous hood?  Don't you think Batman would want some sort of top to his car, he doesn't want the baddies shooting at his exposed head! Need I mention the flashing light thing in the front of the car?  It saddens me that someone, or some people spent a great deal of time and effort on those props and they looked that bad.  I'm sure they worked hard, but I'm sorry, that batmobile was just horrible!  Thank god it didn't last long in the film.Anyhow, this is definitely my least favorite film in the series as most people will agree, but there are some cool things to be seen in the film. So, if you are a fan of Batman, then check out the other three films and then this one, but keep your hopes low.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Batman & Robin
148,OriginalMovieBuff21,"Ok, what's going on here??",5,21 April 2004,"How should I start with Batman & Robin. O yes, well this film came extremely close to killing the batman franchise. Really Really close. I thought the acting was quite terrible especially by Chris O' Donnell. Mr. Freeze was quite funny and stupid also but I kinda of liked the action and the story was a little good, although it did have corny lines and got a little boring at parts. In a way this film was really disappointing and is the worst out of the Batman series. George Clooney was the worst batman out of all of them and Chris O' Donnell is terrible as Robin also but it kind of succeeds in making the movie entertaining even though it is mostly disappointing.5/10",Batman & Robin
149,asda-man,Oh my,5,4 August 2012,"Tim Burton did an amazing job at turning the high-camp 60's TV series into a dark and more seriously tined film with ""Batman"". Here, after Tim's huge step forward, Joel decides to take one huge monumental leap backward into the high-camp and often hilarious 60's years. The result is a film that is amazingly bad, but so bad that it's absolutely hilarious and thus very entertaining. Don't watch ""Batman & Robin"" expecting something with substance. Thank the lord that Christopher Nolan has revolutionised the franchise again more recently! What makes this film so funny is the all-star cast. We've got George Clooney who is totally mis-cast as Batman, Uma Thurman playing an absolutely ridiculous role as a woman who kills people by snogging them and best of all... Arnold Schwarzenegger. Playing the camp Mr.Freeze with a performance even more frozen than that big freeze gun he's got. I don't know how these big names looked at that appalling script and said ""yep, that looks like something I'd do"" because the script is awful.We've got a Mr.Freeze randomly appearing in a freeze suit and big freeze gun, but very little explanation is given to why he's so hot on the cold. He also spurts out an endless amount of cold puns ""chill out!"" and the likes, which are hilarious, especially the way Arnie delivers them in that monotone voice of his. Poisen Ivy is also randomly created by falling into some plant chemicals, as well as a completely useless villain called Bane (I hope Bane's not this much of a moron in The Dark Knight Rises which I've yet to see). Poisen Ivy's powers result to blowing some pink fog at men and being instantly seduced. Leading to an absolutely hilarious rivalry between Batman and Robin.Robin is such an idiot. Batman even points this out to him by saying ""she's trying to kill you Dick!"" But Robin is ashamed of being in Batman's shadow. Robin wants his own show, and thinks that Batman's jealous because Poisen Ivy fancies him and not Batman. Robin is also presented as a complete pervert. Constantly googling Batgirl and the other women in the film. The film is actually largely sexist, there's even a moment where rich old men are bidding for some young women. As well as a long take on Batgirl's arse (and on Batman's and Robin's) and her suit even has Madonna-sized boobs! Although that's nothing compared to the batsuit's nipples.The directing is just as awful as everything else. Not only is there a villain overload, but there's a hero overload to. There's far too many close-ups and long-shots on the action that are cut so quickly it's impossible to know what's going on! All the sets look incredibly fake too, it looks more like a stage-production than a film with its vibrant colours and smoke-effects. Small children would be enthralled (I know I was). There's also a head ache inducing bombastic score being constantly played throughout the film. It's insane! When no music was playing it was some-what deafening! I remember loving ""Batman & Robin"" when I was about seven years old. So my sister and I decided to revisit it for laughs and we certainly got those. The highlight for me was probably Arnie being carried into Arkham Aslyum in a fridge by two guards who take him to a cell that has a ""cold beam"" right above his bed. It's made purely for laughs and isn't supposed to serious (I hope). Although it's over-long and sexist with far too many innuendo's I think small children would find its vibrant colours and sounds enchanting. Whereas the parents can just laugh at it.

150,departed07,A mess! One big mess!,2,20 February 2008,"I just feel like strangling myself right now even when I write this critique about Batman and Robin. There aren't any words to describe this adaptation of the Dark Knight except it sucks! It Sucks! George Clooney is an actor I admire most and consider him one of the best thespian in the movie industry. I have all of his movies ranging from Ocean's Eleven to Good Night and Good Luck where those movies showed that he's everything from a dynamite actor to a director. He plays Batman/Bruce Wayne as if he tries to emulate Adam West from the 1960's show. There's no love of the character or anyways of connecting him to Michael Keaton's dark version.Chris O'Donnell doesn't do much except look like a pretty boy for pin-up calenders as the boy wonder, Robin. He has the quirkiest lines that an action figure doll would say when having his buttons pushed. Chris portrays the sidekick like the Burt Ward character as a screwup rather than a teenager in angst.Alicia Silverstone is a Cindy Crawford clone as Barbara Pennyworth, Alfred's niece, instead of Commissioner Gordon's daughter. She does nothing but show her legs in a school girl uniform in her first scene and plays a smart-aleck to Robin.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr. Freeze, A.K.A. Mr. Freeze, the head villain in the movie. He acts more like a clown in the circus act than a true villain where he has a soft spot for his dead wife he's trying to bring back to life. He gives me the chills for a virus that runs in my stomach.Uma Thurman does what she can as Poison Ivy, a nerdy and earth caring scientist who sees her boss in a secret experiment before getting killed and coming back to life.The plot? Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy or else all of Gotham will die. Boo-Hoo! Ever since the obtuse citizens in America complained about the dark and eerie moments in the Tim Burton films, Joel Schumacher bought the campiness in Batman Forever while trying to bring a dramatic side. Batman and Robin takes too much of the 1960's TV show where I wished that Adam West and Burt Ward would play the characters again.The good? The soundtrack makes up for this mess.",Batman & Robin

Out pops a pair of ice skates, for each of them. Why? Just why in the world would their boots include this feature? It makes no sense whatsoever. Let's say you're Batman, designing all of your gadgets, trying to cover all contingencies, is there a time when you would stop and think: ""gee, someday I might need to compete with ice-skating thugs, so I'd better include some blades in these boots, for both myself and my sidekick.""? If he's including ice skates, why stop there? He should have included a parachute as well, for when he was spontaneously shot into the sky in a rocket, so that he could safely float back down to earth.This is one among many reasons that this awful film is floating like last night's enchiladas in the IMDB toilet bowl",Batman & Robin

Joel Schumacher) Batman (Clooney) and Robin (O'Connell) are back working side-by-side to stop the villains of Gotham City, but is there tension appearing between them, especially when one villainess who calls herself Poison Ivy (Thurman) can make anyone fall in love with herliterally. Along with Poison Ivy, the icy Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) is freezing anything which gets in his way from achieving his goal.Oh dear. What has happened here? Joel Schumacher has managed to turn the Batman franchise into something that could even be worse than the Adam West TV series. Everything is just wrong in this film, such as the direction, the script and even the acting. George Clooney can be imagined as Bruce Wayne but as Batman, comes out only as George Clooney and not the Dark Knight.

154,baileycrawly,"Thankfully, The Conclusion",2,20 September 2020,"This Batman series should've ended with the second one, Batman Returns. Tim Burton gave us two fantastic Batman films that offered enough gothic and quirky content to appeal to those who aren't fans of the superhero genre in general, then Batman Forever gave a straightforward superhero movie that was quite mediocre, tolerably only as a result of Jim Carrey's no-holds-barred portrayal of The Riddler.In Batman and Robin, there's an effort put forth by the cast, but it's just not enough. It's inevitably tied to the films that have came before it, and it suffers because of it. This isn't Tim Burton (it's the only film in the four to not feature Tim Burton in any capacity), it doesn't feature a Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito or Jim Carrey to back it up and, once again, Michael Keaton isn't involved. Of course, his replacement isn't so bad it's unwatchable, but it's still not him, and this film only solidifies his decision to leave the production due to dissatisfaction with the direction of the franchise.Arnold Schwarzenegger does the best he can with the subject matter, but Mr. Freeze just doesn't hold the charm and appeal as the other villains (namely The Joker, The Penguin and The Riddler). George Clooney's take on Batman was okay, but still just satisfactory enough to be passable. Without the brilliant mind of Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher just isn't a good fit for the Batman films.The pacing, as with Batman Forever, is slow in too many places, causing the film to drag. It's ironic that the film in the series that most closely resembles a straightforward superhero film is the one with the worst pacing and most uninteresting execution. Also, without the brilliant music of Danny Elfman, this movie falls flat sonically as well. Elfman knew what he was doing every step of the way, and every single note of the score he laid down was intentional , whereas this one simply does its job filling in the silence without any real emotion to correspond to the events that transpired.If you're going to give a director a chance to tell his version of a story, you owe it to the director to have the opportunity to complete his vision. Tim Burton was at the top of his game when he made Batman and Batman Returns and he got the short end of the stick in a very big way by not being asked to direct Batman 3 & 4 to give a well-rounded story. HE would've gotten Michael Keaton back and kept the story interesting throughout.",Batman & Robin
155,chrisbrown6453,"Let the cheese fly! From start to finish, the fourth installment of the Batman mega-series is filled with all the comic book fluff you can handle.",8,20 July 2001,"And you know what? It still works. George Clooney steps into the batsuit, replacing the troubled Val Kilmer, and makes the role his own. In my opinion Clooney is by far the best of the Batmen. Chris O'Donnell is back as Batman's trusty sidekick Robin, and the beautiful Alicia Silverstone enters the mix as Batgirl. Once again the caped crusader is called upon to stop evil villains from taking over Gotham City. When are these bad guys (and bad women) going to learn that you can't beat the Bat? Is it some sort of ego trip? Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, are the villains-du-jour this time out. Mr. Freeze was a scientist trying to find a cure for MacGregor's disease, the disease that took the life of his wife. Sadly, he fell into some stuff that turned his blood cold and really pissed him off. Poison Ivy, the botanist with a kiss of death just wants to let plant life take over the earth. Two different people, with one goal, to rule the planet, and get rid of Batman and Robin.Without a doubt this movie does what it set out to do, entertain you. It has the same brooding atmosphere as the previous three. A gothic look that makes you wonder why people live there at all. Good guys vs. Bad guys in a battle for the planet. All the usual Batman melodrama, but the one thing that holds this film together is the true family feeling you get from watching Clooney, O'Donnell, Silverstone, and Michael Gough as Alfred. This movie is more about friendship, trust, and family. Before I saw Batman and Robin, I wondered if maybe having another actor play Batman, coupled with Robin from the beginning, and then throwing in Batgirl, would bring down the power of Batman, but it does the opposite. It does what really good movies do, it makes you want more. Instead of just comic book action, there is a feeling of a real family, fighting together as one, and that's what makes this Batman stand out from the rest. People you can feel for, not just root for. Watch out evil doers of the world, Batman and Robin (and Batgirl) are flying high, ready to take a bite out of crime.By the way, when watching this great flick, please note the opening scene. The heros and villians are ""supposed"" to be skating on ice with iceskates. There are many cut-shots where the viewer can clearly make out 4 wheels on their feet as opposed to blades.

In ""Batman Forever,"" he gave it a slightly campy twist and the infamous nipples.In ""Batman And Robin,"" he made several HUGE mistakes in this one: (A)Casting George Clooney, (B)Casting Arnold Schwartzenegger as Mr. Freeze, (C)Casting Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, and (D)Doing a film that seems to run with no logic or a script.There is so much of a mess going on, but to organize it in a clear way, this is the plot: Mr. Freeze is stealing diamonds, so he can destroy Gotham City and save his wife, who is in suspended animation due to a disease called MacGregor Syndrome. At the same time, Alfred the faithful butler (Michael Gough)seems to be suffering the first stages of the same thing. Poison Ivy comes into town around this time, spreading pheromone dust and getting guys hot and bothered. And Alfred's niece Barbara comes into town as well, getting her kicks doing motorcycle races for cash.The film has its action filled moments, but they can only sustain you for long. This movie, unfortunately started to look like a VERY expensive episode of the horrible 60's TV series ""Batman"" It is incredibly corny (Thurman and Schwartzenegger are incredibly over the top.), and many unexplained things (The credit card, with the expiration date ""FOREVER?"")and wasted roles (Elle Macpherson and Vivica A.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr Freeze as an Austrian block of ice who has endless puns about... ice.

161,nobbytatoes,pit of despair of comic book films,3,4 November 2006,"The three Batman films prior to this forth installment to the now Batman saga, all had their own distinctive touches, when looked upon individually, held their own ground. Each one saw a shift in Batman's world; layers revealed in its characters and villains, with Gotham City morphing around the story. Batman and Robin isn't about lightning striking twice; there isn't any lightning to ignite this film, sliding ever so far from it's counterparts.Joel Schumacher jumps back into the directors seat, continuing his cartoonish antics he built in Batman Forever. No matter though how much antics he injects into Batman and Robin, it's not interesting nor entertaining. Continuing with his cartoon visuals of Batman Forever, Schumacher doesn't add anything new; except push the visual boundary further, hardly much credit to be given there. Gotham's visual aesthetic pushes the colour palette to epileptic proportions, yet for all the colour, it's flat and dull.Akiva Goldsman, Batman Forever writer, also returns as screenwriter, the main offender of this depressing film. All films need a solid foundation, if the script is poorly written and time not taken, the film wont work, no matter how visually amazing. Goldsman has taken his creative license to seriously, and run wild. Constant action scenes, which are poorly executed and captured by Schumacher, and gadgets galore, without a shred of levity. The depth, well lack there of, resides in the never ending one liners to the script runs off. Each one bludgeoning you more into idiocy.Batman and Robin fails to dig further into the characters, the missing meat on this very brittle bone. All characters are squashed back to flat, 2-D form; they're walking caricatures that don't play on the extreme cartoon overtures of the story; which worked effectively in Batman Forever. Batman and Robin's squabbling between each other sound more like whining two year old's. An attempt to explore Alfreds past is barely touched upon and left early on. The introduction of Barbara/Batgirl was best left alone; with Alicia Silverstone is her post Clueless form, tearing away from her airhead status, yet truth be told that was her best acting as Cher Horowitz. Goldsman has created a GO-Go-Go sensibility, everything is always on the move, time is never taken to just slow things down, which is sorely needed to develop characters further.Now the villains. Yes they're not the greatest to ever grace the screen, but Mr. Freeze and Poinson Ivy both have merit. Mr. Freeze's cold exterior wrapped around a warm hearted man trying to save his wife. Poison Ivy is a seductive vixen with killer looks. But now back to Goldsman. Without taking the time to develop them, they're walking clichés. Batman Returns and Forever complicated matter with the introduction of two villains, but Freeze and Ivy don't complicate matters, with one world domination attempt to be written in the book of retarded ideas.The cape switches hands again, with George Clooney donning the cape; what a waste. Clooney is wooden and lacked much charisma. You watch his face and can see he's not enjoying the role. Chris O'Donnell's retread, bad boy persona doesn't do much. Alicia Silverstone; we'll just leave that one alone. Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on his role with mirth, but his constant one liners foil than excel. Uma Thurman adds sass and playfulness to Ivy, yet only in small doses, falling to the rest of the cast in her alter ego Dr. Pamela Isley.Batman and Robin: what a stain on this saga.",Batman & Robin

As for the rest of the Bat family this is the second ever movie with Robin and the first and only, up to the time of this review, flick with Batgirl!

As for the suits and the fight scenes I got nothing to say about them are pieces of Crap!The flick is so bad that Joel Schumacher, like the rest of the crew have apologies for making it and he has said that he was making a movie for selling toys and the rest of the actor did it for pay check!

OK so in this movie, Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) are now going up against Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is trying to turn Gotham City into an iceberg with the help of Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). After the first battle with Freeze, Batman and Robin's partnership becomes tense to the point where they try to battle out by going their separate ways. This movie includes the debut of Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), the one thing that they missed up is that in this movie that said that Batgirl is Alfred's niece when in the comic books Batgirl is the daughter of Commissioner James Gordon. I also thought that this movie concentrated more on special effects, bad casting and cheesy one liners instead of focusing more on better writing and a better plot. What they thinking by casting George Clooney as Batman!? Same with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze when Patrick Stewart or Anthony Hopkins would've been a better choice for the role. I also remember reading that there would've been a sequel to this film called ""Batman Triumphant"" which was canceled due to the fact that this movie was a box-office failure, if they went a ahead and did a sequel to this movie they would've dug a deeper hole which was why it was best to put 80's - 90's Batman movies to rest.",Batman & Robin

Batman Returns was entertaining in times, thanks to catwoman and penguin. Batman Forever was amusing in some scenes thanks to The Riddler. Batman Begins is suppose to be the best one, but i disagree. Batman and Robin is the worst out of the lot. You can also add one of the worst films of the decades. After three successful Batman movies, and with a Giant starcast. There's no reason why you shouldn't watch this film. George Clooney is the worst Batman, Keaton is the Best. Schwarznegger was terrible as Mr Freeze. He did not suit the part, and this is his worst movie. Uma Thurman is suppose to temp people, but she over acts. Michelle Peiffer is the best female character in Batman movies.

I would have definitely preferred to see Udo Keir picking up the mantle of Otto Premminger as Mr. Freeze. Keir can convey Teutonic menace with just the lift of an eyebrow. And George Clooney can not act his way out of a paper bag. The one positive in all of this was the addition of Alicia Silverstone as Bat Girl. She brought an excellent new dimension to the film. And, of course Uma Thurman is always fun to watch. Still I have seen much worse in films than this one, and the old Batman TV series was absolutely the corniest camp of any series aired.

But if you take the movie on its own terms, it is really entertaining. If this movie has comparisons to the 1966 series and movie, it is light years ahead when it comes to its special effects and fight scenes. They are very well crafted.Yeah, the villains were, um, weird. But Uma Thurman was so gorgeous to look at, and Arnold Schwarzenegger showed Mister Freeze in a human manner not unlike what George Sanders did when the character surfaced in the 1966 series. Despite the puns, he still brought some humanity to the role.As for the heroes, there seemed to be a little more than just a hint of something homoerotic. If this is the case, I honestly don't care. What I REALLY liked was that Bruce and Dick learned immediately of Barbara's role as Batgirl. That was a welcome relief to the ""Batman"" series 50 years ago, when the whole bit of the Dynamic Duo not knowing of Batgirl's secret identity got stale rapidly and instead became annoying.And I give credit to the screenwriters and George Clooney for not playing Batman as some sort of clown. That was precisely the thing that really ruined the 1966 series toward the end.I've seen worse movies than this. And I like it enough that I got a Blu Ray disc of this movie.

You don't want to look... but you just can't help yourself!In typical Batman tradition, the film stays completely un-true to Bob Kane's comic creations, as Joel Shumacher seems intent on changing even the most trivial details such as who Batgirl's father is.  This would all be ok if there was some other positive aspect of the film, but alas we find none. This film attempts something no other film has ever done: to have 7 main characters all in their own separate plot lines, making for a pot pourri of confusion and silliness.Along with such films as ""ID4"" and ""Armageddon"", this film shows why hype-factories don't make good movies, and independent companies do, with films such as ""Fargo"" and ""Slingblade"".In conclusion, it wasn't the worst movie ever made, but I gave it 4 out of 10.

Chris O'Donnell, tries to give a committed performance, but is lost amongst the wretched excess and camp and while Robin is written to have a chip on his shoulder - O'Donnell himself, looks annoyed to be on set. The two leads flat-line performances are at total odds to the over the top campiness and scenery chewing by every other cast member. Director Joel Schumacher cranks things up to an 11 out of 10 and directs Clooney like Bruce Wayne ate a handful of ambien. The almost dead Alfred shows more life than Wayne.The casting of Schwarzenegger as the puninator Mr. Freeze, is the stuff of bad movie gold. The man is so committed to the role and seems to be having a blast dropping one pun after another, that as embarrassingly hammy as he is, he's the only one that seems to fit into this misguided mess of a world. For a quick moment Schwarzenegger drops the puns and gives a world dominating monologue that channels Bella Legosi in Plan 9 From Outer Space. Uma Thurman, whose quick foray into big budget studio filmmaking began with this turkey and promptly ended a year later with another Warner Bros disaster - the ill fated The Avengers - is difficult to watch, she's so awful here. Alicia Silverstone, like almost everything in this film, is atrocious. She adds nothing but clutter to this overstuffed mess.Batman & Robin has a running time that is punishing in its bloated length and how this made it through the studio and test screening process without being chopped down to 80 minutes, is a missed opportunity to have mercy on audiences. Widely considered one of the worst films in the history of the medium, that's a bit harsh on a harmless bit of stupid confection - but it is a showcase of truly bad filmmaking, a screenplay worth less than a used Kleenex and acting that sucks away all dignity and goodwill.",Batman & Robin
170,GeorgeRoots,They Should Put This Movie AHN ICE!,2,23 December 2013,"I remember my 7 year old self watching this movie, late at night way past my bedtime on a small personal TV I was given. It was so primitive you needed a screwdriver in order to operate the many functions, but that box had introduced me at the time to a world of Schwarzenegger movies, Film4 productions and the Tim Burton 1989 classic (Which still remains my favourite live-action adaptation of the Dark Knight).Sentiments aside, you can already gather how a 7 year old could feel at the time watching this movie without any comic book knowledge from character beginnings to eventual motivations. To me they were characters who dressed in colourful costumes, and did good for the sake of doing good. Common sense tells us that if there's anything that we find strange, but nevertheless teaches us right from wrong it must be ultimately worthy of some mainstream attention.As a kid I loved what little I remembered from it. George Clooney I enjoyed, and I was seriously into Schwarzenegger flicks at the time. Most of all I remember the many colours of this movie being so striking, helping pop out some of the action sequences in my memories. Yes as a kid whose only known existence of Batman at the time was this, ""Batman"" (1989) and the superb ""Batman: The Animated Series"" (1992). Nothing really felt too out of place, and Batman would be a character I'd happily grow up around and continue to follow on his many adventures.However, now at the age of 21 and an Uber-Bat fan fully aware of the characters 74 years and history. ""Batman and Robin"" is a film I love to hate, but also hate to love. I mean WOW, the movie itself is an utter disaster, a spectacle of bad. Considering that one of my favourite interpretations of BATMAN is Adam West's superior campy 1960's show, how this movie is below even that level of standards and fun is beyond me. Watching it now bat nipples, a*ses and all. The film is utter painful. The fact that Christopher Nolan as of now has brought the character back in magnificent fashion, I feel people should be ready to embrace this movie with open arms with the same flamboyancy of any midnight cult movies throughout the decades.Talking specifically now about the movie, Clooney & Chris must have taken up drinking after reading such abysmal dialogue. Schwarzenegger had a field day with so many ""ICE"" puns, and I even completely forgot of Bane's existence within the picture. So much exposition is summarised in its overall unimpressive story, makes ""Batman & Robin"" THE WORST THING IN THE ENTIRE BATMAN MYTHOS. BUT! The fact the we actually have a proper physical representation of how bad Batman can get, warms my heart in the fact that this is the template we can use to make sure this never happens again. And to be honest, it's now beloved as a ""it's so bad, it's hilarious"" kind of movie. That's why I feel in some weird way had it been made in a different era, people may have embraced it much more favourably. Still bad though.Final Verdict: I love to hate it, I hate to love it. Even if you are a dedicated Batman fan, you owe it to yourself to see one of the worst movies ever made, and a depiction of the Dynamic Duo that will have you laughing you a*se off for all the wrong reasons. 2/10.

172,patches89,The film that nearly killed Batman,1,15 November 2020,If you thought that Batman Forever was a bad hard crash from the 2 brilliant Burton films then you havent seen anything yet. Batman now played by George Clooney was a disaster and the only point of any entertainment was Arnie's Mr Freeze but even then the character was so bad. The film was completely devoid of a plot and even children who this is aimed at must feel insulted. Thankfully it killed off this part of Batman and we got much better adaptations in the future,Batman & Robin
173,the amorphousmachine,This is in my Top Ten worst list..,1,10 September 2000,"I can't believe the producers even released this rubbish onto the cinema screens in the first place. What were they thinking? Yeah we'll release a film that will probably destroy a decent franchise.I was worried after 'Batman Forever' though, mainly because I could see 'campy' within it, and the way they introduced Robin was lame! What saved that film to a passable mark was Jim Carrey! Nobody saved this film- actually the whole cast was extremely bad (with the exception of Michael Gough)! But whose fault is that? George Clooney should never have been cast, Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were just annoying and Arnie just didn't have the same villain power as Jack Nicholson!Joel Schumacher is a good director as we've seen with The Lost Boys, Falling Down, A Time to Kill and 8MM. He's very capable of directing quality, so why did he choose not to take his two 'Batman' outings seriously? Probably because he's never read the comic-or he liked the 60s television series too much! Burton had the right idea, but the big guys in Hollywood said it was too 'dark'! Then along comes Schumacher, who goes totally nuts in his second outing and the fourth installment!The sets were bad and over-the-top, the script was full of cheesy, campy dialogue that works for five year-olds, the action scenes were totally ridiculous and patronising! Seriously, when is Hollywood going to realise that just because your making a film about a comic book, that it doesn't entitle them to target an audience below the age of five. If Schumacher had taken 'Batman and Robin' more seriously, instead of being patronising and cheesy, then this film may have been worth the millions they spent. I don't get it, lets give these directors a huge budget so they can make a film with no merit and that is dumbed-down for the audience so that it's nice all round! Gimme a break- at least Spawn had cool effects. Batman and Robin had nothing except 'camp'!I really loathe this film, it's an insult to give a director a huge budget and produce and distribute this pile of garbage! The casting, the script, sets and especially the direction was shocking! Schwarzenegger is nothing like Mr Freeze from the comics, and with lines like ""Ice to meet you!"" makes me wonder how people originally complained about the first Batman! In fact, Batman and Robin is so badly overdone and stupid that it may have destroyed the franchise Burton established! This pitiful film gets a 1/2 out of *****!",Batman & Robin

If you like this movie cool I hate it! AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH. I hate this movie. Peace a garbage. It is so much humor, parody. I was laughing my ass off on this movie. Everyone in here is a laughing stock. This movie is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It is a parody. Too many villians, to many superheros, stupid winter! This movie is stupid! Horrible dialogues. Bad awful acting they are atrocious.Robin is just a complaning and crying like a whiny brat he is! I love 89 Batman, I love Batman Forever (1995) I love that film to death. I like Batman Returns this movie is garbage. It copy's Batman Returns and Batman Forever. So this garbage has blue and pink colors. Joel Shumacher ruined this film. In the opening sequence Robin must save Batman. Really? Can't Batman save him self? He is no longer a bad-ass like he was in the first three movies.This movie has so much awful CGI used, horrible music sound. Batman and Robin are horrible, horrible in this movie. George Clooney is the worst Batman ever!!! He portayed superhero badly and poorly. This was a dead franchise until Batman Begins come out in 2005 thank god. This is not The Dark Knight it is not a cape crusader Clooney dosen't act like Batman we know. He acts like a joke.Stupid lines: Robin: ""I want a car! Chicks dig the car! Batman: That is why Superman works alone"" I hate those words. Poison Ivy is a moron! Uma Thurman what the hell happened with you? Arnold Schwarzenegger you completely over act this is over acting. Horrible painful lines. This movie is painfull to watch. This movie is a terrible mess. Batgirl Alica Silverstone why, why why she is in here? So I am going to watch her fake body in Hollywood, her boobs and her but? No thank you. Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Clooney to me were both atrocious. Batman, Robin and Batgirl's costumes have Batnipples and Batasses.The plot is just not good, I don't get the story. I hate it when they make Alfred Pennyworth dying in this movie. Unbelievably bad one-liners on Arnold Schwarzenegger's part. Chris O'Donnell's acting is that of a spoiled brat and his character Robin spends most of his screentime just whining and complaining. Plotholes. Poison Ivy went from being a flexible scientist to a one-note villain. Bane is portrayed as being incredibly stupid, in stark contrast to his comic book counterpart who has genius-level intellect.Batman, despite being very rich, has A BAT CREDIT CARD! Which was said later to actually make sense. Numerous homosexual innuendos. (There is an interesting theory that they are in the film due to Joel Schumacher being a homosexual) Just like its predecessor, The film has a more syrupy and comical tone than a serious tone for a superhero film. Most fans thought that George Clooney made a poor Batman and Clooney himself even admitted that he despised playing Batman.It nearly killed the Batman franchise until Christopher Nolan successfully rebooted it with the Dark Knight trilogy, almost 10 years after Batman and Robin came out. Pointless and unnecessary cameo from the rapper Coolio. Batgirl's family history and backstory was completely messed up.This movie sucks, it sucks so bad it is a disaster. I hate this movie it is a painfull to watch. Chill haters? No thank you! I hate, hate this movie the music score suuuucks!!! There is nothing good about this movie! Joel Schumacher apologize for this movie, but I don't forgive him at all. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc for the Schwarzenegger collection. Yes I bought this movie only for Schwarzenegger collection and not Batman. This movie is not a Batman movie it is floop and a joke.",Batman & Robin

177,ReelCheese,I've Lost Faith In Humanity,1,7 May 2006,"BATMAN & ROBIN will make you lose all faith in Hollywood, indeed humanity as a whole. Stunningly awful, this was a disaster from the moment George Clooney traded in his scrubs for the black rubber boots. And it's not even awful in a cute, SHOWGIRLS kind of way. You won't laugh, but you might cry over the fact you've just flushed 125 precious minutes of your life down the crapper.While everyone involved brings shame to their families, from the uncomfortable Clooney as the lamely-interpreted hero to Governornator Arnold Schwarzenegger as the junior-high-dialog-spewing Mr. Freeze, director Joel Schumacher must be punched the hardest. Even those who thought he embarrassed the franchise with the light-hearted BATMAN FOREVER were taken aback. Schumacher treats the audience like a group of eight-year-old boys with ADD, constantly trying to impress us with unexciting action scenes like a hockey-themed opening battle reminiscent of the under-appreciated genius of MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.The writers only make things worse with their ""witty"" hero chatter (""This is why Superman works alone""... har har, where do they come up with them??) and drawn-out ""human"" angles, such as butler Alfred's illness and a childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin and the sexy Poison Ivy. This isn't root-on-the-heroes entertainment. On the contrary, you'll find yourself wishing Poison Ivy would tongue kiss both masked men to put us all out of our misery.I love Batman and superhero flicks. I'm not a movie snob by any means, as I'm willing to forgive many a gaffe. But I absolutely loathe BATMAN & ROBIN. I loathe how it disgraces the characters it depicts. I loathe how the ""talent"" involved is still allowed within 100 feet of a film set or writer's room. It must be said again that BATMAN & ROBIN is the kind of experience that will make you lose all faith in Hollywood -- and humanity.",Batman & Robin
178,stormhawk2021,This review will get down voted,1,1 October 2017,"I'm not a Batman hardcore fan, but it seems to be a mass assault on IMDb of reviewers who downvoting the reviews that speak the truth about this movie, and upvoting anyone praising it. I honestly wonder if Joel Schumacher is personally paying those IMDb trolls to do this in exchange of bucks.Before his debut, Schumacher (not the F1 racer) was so sure, but so sure that he was going to have tremendous success, that he was already preparing a continuation, that he had signed the main ones a contract for his continuation that already had title: Batman Triumphant (which should have premiered in 1999, celebrating Batman's 60th anniversary).It transformed a Gothic city from dark to turn it into a gay nightclub, full of neon lights, imposing male statues, etc. I saw a promo of this film, in which its director boasted that he had read all the Batman comics and knew very well how to take this character to the movies, I do not really know what kind of comic this man has seen, there are Batman comics , According to the time of publication and this bullshit of film, will be anything but a Batman film.
Starting with George Clooney, he puts on his beating face at all times, either as Bruce Wayne or Batman, for him it gives him the same, Robin, extremely hateful, this character all he does is tantrums, is very plaintive. The villain that Mr. Freeze has nothing, he just says jokes, smiling at every moment, always with a phrase more stupid than the other, and also erroneous, for his suit, no comments. Uma Thurman, was over the top; Alicia Silverstone, the worst choice for a Batgirl, a character who also should never have been on the screen, just to know a couple of judo moves, and is already Batgirl enters the cave and already has its own Batsuit, knows how to use all the Bat-tools and vehicles and knows where is the lair of the villains. And for Bane, it's not worth mentioning, he is just a masked goon, grunting like Frankenstein's monster; and he is easy to defeat pulling the tubes connected on his head. It's said that it is a film made to the spirit of the series from 1965, please, this series has its charm and is better than this swill.Where is the Batman of Burton comics and films? The one who, in order to catch the villains, had to do detective work, as Mr. Nolan. Where is that Batman, who never lets himself be photographed, that Batman that hides in the night? From Batman Forever, who poses for newspapers, comes out on magazine covers, and here he goes to brothel parties, he just had to do the Batusi.Joel Schumacher with this film, happened to be a visionary man, ahead of his time, Why? For the simple fact that filmmakers such as Scary Movie, Hero Movie, etc., do not have to perform their ""Batman Movie"", Schumacher is ahead of them.1. Close-ups to the butts? Nipples in the suits? What sissy! Why did not they also put on nipples to Batgirl? 2. Acrobatic jumps and choreographies in the style Disney on Ice? And special effects taken out from Power Rangers?3. Sounds of caricatures for blows, falls, etc. I just need to put the Boom! Crash! Pow! 4. Bat-credit card? That was a total insult to fans and common sense. 5. Buddy cars tuned with lights of a thousand colors? The speakers were missing.This film is just abysmal. Please, avoid this film to all cost.",Batman & Robin

Even though, there are worse things out there.",3,11 April 2000,"**Sorry for spelling mistakes**                              In my earlier reviews i have already explaned my love for the two first movies, so I won't explane why this movie is nothing compared to them. ''Batman & Robin'' makes you wonder if this is supposed to be some kind of remake of ''Batman'' from 1966. The movie is so silly, that you just have to see it. But, still, it's not THAT lousy, just very ''nothing''.                              George Clooney is a stupid choise as Batman, and why isn't Donnell gone yet? Alicia Silverstone is around just to destroy the magic from the two movies called ''Batman'' and ''Batman Returns''.
                              Schwarzenegger is supersilly, but Uma Thurman is still pretty ok as evil Poison Ivy.                               To bad the plot is just as thin as a potato chip.",Batman & Robin
180,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Schumacher destroys an American icon,1,9 September 2007,"Wow. Could it get much worse? On paper, this movie probably looked great. Hell, Clooney practically is Bruce Wayne, Chris O'Donnell looked like Robin, Uma Thurman is a great actress, and Arnold is Arnold. What's not to like? The horrid direction and screenplay, that's what, not to mention possibly the cheesiest dialog in history.Batman (Clooney) and Robin (O'Donnell) are continuing their crime fighting antics and saving Gotham from danger. Even if it looks like some weird acid trip form of Las Vegas. But as Alfred (Michael Gough) fades away, the two heroes begin to have conflicting attitudes. However, they must reconcile, for the murderous and catastrophic trio of Mr. Freeze (Schwartzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and Bane are ready to literally freeze Gotham.Sounds like a good plot. Good cast. Except said cast, outside of Uma Thurman, doesn't act. Clooney plays Clooney. He isn't Batman. He's George Clooney/Danny Ocean in a Batsuit. It's so frustrating to watch him and think ""this guy actually thinks he's acting?"". Clooney obviously does movies like this and Ocean's 12 just for the money. Chris O'Donnell...well, I guess you could say he's the best, but he still really sucks. He sounds and acts like a child. Schumacher needs to be slapped across the face for allowing the actors to be this bad. Uma Thurman...she pretty much defines over acting and cheese in this movie. Poison Ivy, one of Batman's most intriguing nemeses, has become a crazy sex icon that it is just laughable how cheesy she gets. I'm not going to rag on Arnold too much. I think he was good, but once again, Schumacher doesn't help him out at all. Alicia Silverstone is equally as painful to watch as Batgirl/Barbara Gordon. Seriously, she was the best they could come up with. Really? Are you FREAKING kidding me? Joel Schumacher. You gave us Phone Booth, which was good. I am so glad I became a movie buff afterwards, otherwise I probably would have skipped Phone Booth because of the incredibly crappy, cheesy, and half-assed movie you gave us all here. The campiness and cheese factor is overwhelming and just mind blowing. All the neon and crazy color schemes gave me a headache. Batman is a serious and dark character. Schumacher has turned him into the laughingstock of the comic book superheroes. I'm so glad that Christopher Nolan came around and totally kicked Batman back into shape, because it would have been a travesty if this had been the final Batman film.1/10 --spy",Batman & Robin

183,basrutten,Painful,3,10 November 2002,"I knew in advance that this wouldn't be a good movie, but at least I thought I could get some good laughs out it. Unfortunately, this movie is so pointless and nonsensical that it became painful to watch rather then (unintentionally) funny. I've never really liked the Batman movies, but at least some of them had some memorable roles in them (Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman). In this part, only Uma Thurman is passable as Poison Ivy, the rest of the performances is too terrible to mention. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the villain proves once and for all that he can't act and his puns are beyond pathetic. George Clooney as Batman? Aargh !The poor performances would have been acceptable if there had been any kind of good story or good action. Unfortunately, the story tries to cover way too many things at once (TWO villians, BatGirl & Robin, the disease of the butler) and ends up being mostly boring. In terms of action, most scenes are completely ridiculous, the one-liners are forced and not funny, and the props look like they were taken from the original Star Trek series. All of this makes ""Batman and Robin"" painful to watch, even for fans of campy nonsense. The camp is so overdone that it becomes painful and boring to watch, rather then hilarious.1/2 out of **** starts (mainly because of Uma Thurman)",Batman & Robin

The mix undoubtedly did not work, but for someone who liked the TV-show, like me, watching this film is a real blast, with its ridiculously over-the-top lines and camp-energy.Though the film added little credibility to the Batman franchise I still have to admit that I simply loved George Clooney's and Arnold Scwartzenegger's character-portrayals.In spite of this, I can not forgive shoddy film-making and obviously cheap scenes involving green goo, re-used footage, ridiculously big car-chases, bouncing ice-sickles and reversed film.As a film, Batman & Robin is quite the mess, if a funny one.",Batman & Robin
185,swedzin,Abomination.,1,11 September 2011,"And he we are... one of the worst films of all time right on the palm of your hand. You got a choice - DVD player, or a trash can? Well, most of the people would choose trash can. And so would I... but, let's review it first. The overall design. Gotham, neon gangs (again), high-tech, ridiculous gadgets, high-tech, funny costumes, vehicles, environment, the visual looks of everything is just mental. Schumacher succeeded to disappoint the entire world, not just Batman fans, but the entire world that gave their money down the drain in cinemas all over! Good thing I rented it. And yes, it was a big time shock. This film is a kingdom of cheesiness and campy looks. An expensive piece of crap! Which is turned into a mindless porn for no designated audience. Yes, Batman Forever had a good success, so this project was green lighted. It is bizarre, when you remember, the success of the Burton's Batman (1989) and with a little bit lesser success of Batman Returns (1992), also by Burton. The history repeated itself by, in my opinion, giving too much freedom to the director and writers. And this is what happens. Schumacher hired Akiva Goldsman to write script again. And I think that he can bestow his script on the pile of donkey turd. The movie is basically like the third one, but with even worse, like, everything.Let's start with actors and characters. Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was a seriously huge mistake. I love Arnold, but Mr. Freeze is complex and dark character, with tragic background. And since when Arnold tried to play that kind of character? Never! George Clooney was also a very bad decision for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. Though I admit, as Bruce Wayne he had that charm and charisma, but it was Clooney charisma, that pretty much fitted Wayne. Chris O'Donell's Robin was unbearable. Just too much. But, you can sense that O'Donell had a ball playing Robin. Uma Thurman was a good choice for Poison Ivy, but badly performed and a total miss as a character. And it's not entirely her fault. Bane was also totally missed. He looked interesting visually, but they portrayed him as a mindless tank. But, the worst thing here of all is none other than Alicia Silverstone. I'll try to be gentle here, but her acting is just the worst in the film. Yes, worse than Arnold's. The other characters as Gordon, played by Pat Hingle, was just horrible. Just forgotten in this crazy film. John Glover is a good actor, but his character was unnecessary and ridiculous. We also have Bob Kane's wife in the film - Elizabeth Sanders. Nothing new, and nothing important. She was there just because of her husband. And speaking of Kane, I think this film killed him! The film was released in 1997, the next year, he passed away! Coincidence? I think not! One good thing about this film is Michael Gough and his portrait of Alfred. You gotta love this Alfred. He was good, as always. The music score was OK, but it was the same Eliot Goldenthal's score from ""Batman Forever"".One thing you have to remember, this movie is bad, but it is all because Schumacher and Goldsman. The actors in this film are pretty good in other projects. So, it's NOT entirely THEIR fault. They tried their best to adapt to Schumacher's and Goldsman's craziness, but... no dice. This is the movie, that you should watch with your friends. But first... get drunk, or high first... it would be a lot easier to watch if you are intoxicated with a bunch of crap in your metabolism. And If you really don't want this to kill your brain cells. Now, where is that trash can?",Batman & Robin

187,Olicosmic,A hilariously misguided film in the series that was made to sell toys.,1,18 September 2019,"After loving the first 1989 film, really liking ""Returns"", and being indifferent to ""Forever"", it was a bit scary to see where the caped crusader would head next for me, as, in my opinion, each following Batman film was a bit worse than the last. However, I still kept an open mind, as I was ready for another fun adventure with my favorite superhero--hopefully more fun than what happened in ""Forever"". However, that was all thrown straight out the window when I heard the opening lines:Robin: ""I want a car! Chicks dig the car!""
Batman: ""This is why Superman works alone""The minute that happened, I knew I was in for a cornball cheesefest of a lifetime, which is something I never wanted out of Batman. And, this is, indeed, a cornball cheesefest of a lifetime. The dark tone and intense action that made the first two films work very well is completely absent, here. Sure, it was sporadic in ""Forever"", but at least that film had fun action scenes that worked. Here, everybody and their mother is attached to a line, and it's incredibly obvious as the physics are way over the top and are never convincing in the slightest. Everything is more goofy than anything else. Speaking of goofy, the performances are all off. Whether it be the incredibly tame Batman who's literally nothing more than George Clooney in a Batman suit, or the overly cheesy Poison Ivy, the performances are certainly memorable, albeit, for the wrong reasons. Of course, talking about over the top performances from this film is impossible without bringing up the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. He's just so brainless and hilariously miscast (like everyone else, but not to this extent), that I can never do anything else but laugh when he's on screen, and, again, for the wrong reasons. The dialogue helps with this by being incredibly stupid, and it's not just with Mr. Freeze, but with everyone else. Every bit of dialogue is straight up cheese, and it never goes deep, even when the film really wants it to. Need I remind you of the opening lines I went over earlier? This wouldn't be that big of an issue, but none of the films beforehand, even including ""Forever"", were anywhere near as cheesy, making this film mesh horribly with the the series. Nothing gets better from then on, either. Not even the sets are that good. Sure, I can see some effort into a few of them, but for the most part. A perfect example being the ice that Mr. Freeze left on a car. It's as clear as day that they're plastic, as they even move slightly from someone barely touching it. The costume designs are okay, but they are incredibly obviously made to sell toys. Literally everyone in this film looks like an action figure in one way or another. That's mainly because the toy manufacturers actually helped design the costumes in this film. Yes, you read that right. They butted in to make revenue with recognition of their toys. So, not only was little to no effort put in to making a film that's at least the tiniest bit commendable, but this is essentially a huge toy commercial. Besides that, I did find myself laughing at how poor everything turned out to be, as the dialogue is so stupid and the performances are so out of whack, this film certainly falls into the ""so bad, it's good"" sub-genre. It's still a shame that this would be the film to follow the 3 successful films beforehand, because it shows how out of touch the film makers were here, as nothing really works whatsoever, and what almost does gets ruined by the hilariously cheesy performances and dialogue. Overall, this is a hilariously misguided entry in the series that was made to sell toys. Watch it for the unintentional humor, but whatever you do, do not take it seriously.",Batman & Robin

I shudder when I think what will happen to Joel Schumacher for killing the ""Batman"" franchise.""Batman"", the best of the series, was a dark, psychotic and complex movie with over the top acting and settings. The Batmobile was beautiful, as were the sets. The movie was forceful and interesting. ""Batman Returns"" shared some of the traits of its predecessor while adding more lunacy to the mix. It did suffer from the lack of top of the line talent (Jack Nicholson).
And then Mr. Schumacher ruined everything. ""Batman Forever"" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. Since its from the same series, there is no excuse for the director to run wild and away from the spirit of the originals, in which a sad soul has to fight crime in order to mantain sanity. In Schumacher movies, Batman has to have the coolest cars, to kiss the most beautiful girls and to have a lot of fun while doing this. The first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice which was painfully taken by Batman; in the last 2 it is as if violence was fun and part of Batman´s life.There are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. But there are two things that are an insult to every film goer: the Batmobile is reduced to a clownmobile, and Batman´s suit has NIPPLES in it. What a disgrace of a movie.

189,trokanmariel-17760,Verdict: Batman & Robin has a type of inclusion and all-seeing factor that's supernatural,10,22 December 2020,"In Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - a trilogy I now support - ideology is the argument. Conservatism, Marxism, collectivism, anarcho-fundamentalism and liberalism, and all the like are different arguments to be sided with.In the late Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, ideology is the supernatural. That means, arguments to be sided with is the supernatural.In past reviews, the supernatural hasn't been on my side. With Batman & Robin, all I've had to do, just now, is list the ideologies, and thus, I am a winner. Ergo, the supernatural is inherently on my side, when it comes to Batman & Robin.The real question, is, if I were to do each a review for Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, each time discussing the appropriate ideology for said movie, would that upset the supernatural status of my having had the list for Batman & Robin?The response, is no, it wouldn't.The reason for this, is because of the list's not existing as a list for The Dark Knight trilogy.Batman & Robin has the list, and its needless meaning of use is Batman & Robin's supernatural status.The sheer simple fact, of seen: as Barbara looms over Alfred, the camera sees her. As Bruce looms over Alfred, the camera sees him.As Victor watches his self-made dancing figurine, in Arkham Asylum, the camera makes an extreme point of him seeing the toy woman.Batman & Robin sees everything. Needlessly, hence, playfully, all while keeping in tact the mature and sociological function of the seeing of what's seen.I did a review for this movie, back in 2017, on a different site, I also then discussed the supernatural status, of political ideology, but of course, being less equipped to carry on that supernatural status. Now, 4 years later, the seeing of the story is still the same meta-weight.I trace back to the ideology list, and I'm loaded with enthusiasm. Barbara Wilson's non-existent relationship, with Bruce Wayne is part of the enthusiasm, and yet it's needless.The context, that the screen can't see Barbara talking to Bruce except for at the beginning and end of Barbara's time in Wayne Manor (relative to the movie) is vindicated by the meta-feeling, existent when Barbara, Dick Grayson and Bruce finally venture off to the astronomy tower . .As the three finally make their way, to the tower, dressed up, the word context itself might as well be known and understood as ""con""-text; specifically, this can mean that con is like an abyss of weight, and like a shadow, pulling at the brain of the intelligence. Text, naturally, is the X mark.All that's required is inclusion, not correction. For as much as I support Nolan's Wayne, Harvey Dent and Joker, the difference is the absence of necessity, of being correct.Even the Animated Series, as iconic and brilliant as it is, is also about being correct, thus is also flawed relative to the supernatural composition of Batman & Robin.So now what I need to do, is trace back to the beginning, and go over why Batman & Robin has the mercy, of its not being about being correct.To put it simply (once again): Batman & Robin has a type of inclusion and all-seeing factor that's supernatural.",Batman & Robin
190,Mitch-38,Gads...What a terrible flick,2,27 January 2001,"Just too much, way over the top. Enough ham from ""Der Arnold"" to put the prosciutto producers in Italy out of business. Silly & predictable story, amplified special effects, loathsome dialogue and a bubble-headed script. It leaves one with the startling impression that this film was made by craftspeople, but by profiteers. George Clooney tries, but even his subdued performance is simply ridden roughshod over by the overblown antics. Alfred the butler, who barely has time to wave a ""DIET COKE"" in our faces (commercial implications anyone? Hmmm), before he's stricken down with some ailment or other. Yes, Batman even gets upstaged by his domestic servant. There's no respect for superheroes anymore, dang it. Well, back to the ""Arnie and Uma Show""...oops, meant BATMAN AND ROBIN there. Well, the bad guys/gals are really bad...as in acting. Uma Thurman is game as Poison Ivy, and saved this movie from being a total BOMB. Arnold faces three foes in this film, and it's not Batman, Robin or Batgirl. It's the costume (too big), the shoes (too big) and the part (too big).
If the producers have the audacity to put another Batman flick on the screen, we can only hope they'll not cut corners this time, and actually have a script written for it. Gentle reader, you have been warned.",Batman & Robin
191,Old Joe,A chilling chapter of the Dynamic Duo,5,16 February 2001,"The fourth chapter in the Batman series is full of great special effects, some fine performances, but also stretches out a character that for me has lost it's appeal in some way. Eight years before this film, the original Batman was brought to our attention, which I believe it did capture. But the films to follow don't live up to it's predecessor, unfortunately.Chills and thrills: Will Gotham City be put on ice? The Dark Knight battles his greatest threat yet: Cold-Hearted Mr Freeze and the venomous Poison Ivy. Batman has more than Gotham City to protect: the youthful eagerness of crimefighting comrades Robin and Batgirl puts them frequently in harm's way. Can the heroic trio save Gotham? Or will Mother Nature have her way and evil freeze the world?In Batman and Robin, I still feel that the bad guys capture the audience's attention. No character is more dominant in any of the films like the chilling Mr Freeze, played by Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger. But to be fair, his character requires it, just like the Joker and Riddler did in previous films. Arnie was well casted as Mr Freeze. Even better was the way that his character was brought to the big screen. I must admit it would have been difficult to wear the freeze suit. Schwarzenegger acted the role of Mr Freeze just nicely and I don't think that anyone else could have done this role any better.His evil partner in Batman 4 was Poison Ivy and her sidekick 'Baine'. Playing the deadly Ivy, was Uma Thurman. She was gorgeous in this role. Though I do feel that some of her lines in this film were clichéd. Poison Ivy as a character was exceptionally portrayed by Thurman. I loved the way her character used her feminine wiles to trap innocent men and poison them. Plus her hideout was cleverly constructed.The good guys in Batman and Robin include a couple of new faces. Batman/Bruce Wayne this time around was former ER star George Clooney. As good as George was as the Dark Knight, I feel that he didn't suit the role of Batman. Batman is supposed to be a little scary towards his enemies, yet Clooney at no stage was scary to me. He needs credit though as he had injured an ankle in a basketball match during filming of this movie and you wouldn't even have known that he had. Good again as Robin was Chris O'Donnell, but the only part of his role which did floor it a bit, was how Batman didn't trust him. The movie could have been a lot better if this conflict between the good guys didn't happen.I must admit the storyline in this Batman was OK. The introduction of Batgirl/Barbara Wilson (played by the gorgeous Alicia Silverstone) was well done. I especially like how Barbara was a little wild and took a risk or two (eg. like her motorbike racing). Even the way she became Batgirl was quite good. Again the right choice of actor was made for this character. The one saving grace for all the Batman movies would have to be that Alfred was played by Michael Gough in all four films. As good as he was in the first three films, his role was fantastic in Batman and Robin. Portraying a sick and dying man, yet still willing to serve his master to the very letter, was true testimony to Gough. Credit must also go to the writers of Batman and Robin as the story was quite compelling, especially in the roles of Mr Freeze and Alfred.Director Joel Schumacher again directs Batman, without producer Tim Burton at his side, and here in lies a problem with this film. Again the set doesn't have the true Gotham City feel to it, with it being too light. The Mr Freeze character did effect the way that Gotham had to look. Same has to be said with the character of Poison Ivy as her character required plenty of light also. The Batcave is something which has also lost its creepiness as each movie was made. Yet, the special effects in Batman and Robin are of the finest quality. The way Mr Freeze hurts people, the scene with the Dynamic Duo skysurfing and how Gotham is frozen was spectacular to watch. The vehicles in this Batman were good. The new Batmobile, Batcraft and Batbike were all impressive, as was the vehicle which Mr Freeze drove around.The Batman story this time around is only good as it razzles and dazzles the audience. But no movie can survive on Special effects alone and this movie requires the special effects to do so. I must also push that Michael Keaton made the right choice to leave the Batman movies when he did. The men to play Batman after him haven't been anywhere near as good, as have the movies.If you are die-hard Batman fan watch this film, because I say you will enjoy it!CMRS gives 'Batman and Robin': 2.5 Stars (Ok - Good Film)",Batman & Robin
192,Indy-52,aaargh!!!,5,18 September 1999,"man, this movie is truly atrocious! It's one of the worst movie experiences of my life! It should have won all the Razzie's it was nominated for! The plot & acting are amazingly bad: Batgirl was totally unnecessary, Robin dito and i don't even wanna talk about the new Batman... George Clooney is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas (now where have i heard that quote...?). The worst thing about this movie is that it is identical to nr. 3: if you pay attention, you see it just follows the exact same pattern! This movie is the most poor attempt at a sequel i've ever seen. DO NOT SEE IT!",Batman & Robin
193,Ziya90,I take it as an alternative Batman,6,15 February 2010,"The rating of Batman and Robin is such low, because it is not dark and not serious that what people had expected. There are funny characters, funny dialogs, kitsch costumes, weapons, vehicles. I was shocked when saw the Bat credit card, but it was funny, not pathetic, because this is not a serious Batman movie. Visually, there is almost every color, so it is like a funfair. Then, what's the odds? Probably, people don't see Batman and Robin as a parody and it seems that yes, it is not a parody, but an alternative Batman adventure. A different kind of Batman like Nolan's Batman movies, Nolan's movies were different kind of Batman movies too, weren't they? I want to talk about some negative reviews I read. It is said that Schwarzenegger is the worst choice for Mr. Freeze and he was ridiculous. Firstly, I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, so it was a lot of fun to watch him in a Batman movie and as Mr. Freeze who is one of my favorite villains in Batman, but if I had not been a fan of him, still I would have said, Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze is not ridiculous. His costume, his weapon look kitsch and childish may be, but interesting and appealing. Yes, like an amusement park. Yes, if you ask me the best choice for Mr. Freeze would be Stanley Tucci and it would be great, if there had been a movie based on him, but I have no problem with this Mr. Freeze. In this movie, some characters are ridiculous, not the actors. For example, Bane character was wasted, but it was entertaining too that is another story. It is said that George Clooney was the worst Batman. I agree with that, because yes, he is inappropriate for this role, Batman. He is the man of the characters who wear suit, not a super hero who wears glaring costumes. Batman in this movie looks like a guy who is in a fancy dress party. As for The Gotham City design, it is kitsch in a good way except for the colossus brownish statue, anti-stylish! The arguments between Batman and Robin and the competition between them for Poison Ivy were unnecessary. Batgirl was an awful idea, it is almost unbearable. And also she causes three heroes for three villains cliché. Lastly, Robin is interested in her which is soap bubble. However, as said, visually, this is one of the most colorful movies so far and in terms of action, Batman and Robin is almost non stop that is like a roller coaster in funfair.",Batman & Robin
194,wildlife-ptech,Mediocre and dull despite good visuals,4,16 October 2019,Rating4/10Mediocre follow up to Returns is a letdown. Despite a big budget story feels childish and bloated. Action scenes are dull and uninvolving. Visuals are good and Arnold is energetic but can't carry the film alone. Clooney seems miscast.,Batman & Robin
195,AwesomeWolf,Bad,3,15 January 2005,"How did 'Batman' turn into this? 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' were great, but then Tim Burton was replaced with Joel Schumacher. Schumacher's first attempt at the franchise ended up becoming 'Batman Forever', while it wasn't all that bad, it had nothing on the first two. And then there was 'Batman & Robin'. I don't understand what Schumacher was thinking. Why take the awesomeness of the first two, and throw it away in a lame attempt to mimic the 60s 'Batman' TV series and movie?'Batman & Robin' begins with Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and a museum heist. Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell, again) try to stop him, but are bested by Freeze's evil ice-hockey team. This is about the only time I could 'say' awesome in this movie.In other super-villain news, a mad scientist working for Wayne Industries is turning prisoners into super-soldiers. You know he is a mad scientist because he hasn't combed his hair in years. Lab assistant Dr. Pamela Isley discovers this operation, and is greeted with attempted murder. Of course, this being a movie based on a comic, she doesn't die. No, she comes back as super-villainess Poison Ivy, and spends the rest of the movie running around with Bane and Mr Freeze, being chased by Batman and Chris O'Donnell (doing his best to pretend he is an angsty teen).If I have anything good to say about 'Batman & Robin' it is: It manages to be entertaining if you're into B-movies, and the visuals have improved over 'Batman Forever'. That's about it.Onto the bad, but where to begin? Fault the first - George Clooney is not Batman. George Clooney is George Clooney, he plays himself, not a brooding super-hero, scientist and businessman. By 'Batman & Robin', Chris O'Donnell is definitely far too old to play at being an angsty teenager. As for Arnie, Mr. Freeze just isn't his style. Among other things, Arnie has better dialog in every movie he has ever been in.Plot-wise, this is just a 2-hour comic on screen, but it isn't a 'Batman' comic. No, it is more like some lame, unoriginal rip off which features similar characters. 'Batman & Robin' was definitely trying to be 60s Batman while still being serious. Big no. The action isn't much better either. The soundtrack has some Smashing Pumpkins, which is good, but on the other hand, Danny Elfman's awesome score has just disappeared without a trace.3/10 - Pretty bad film, but entertaining as a cheesy B-movie.",Batman & Robin
196,smellthecult-com-1,This is not a good film....,1,24 September 2009,"Jesus suffering a lingering one, this is an utter abomination. Clooney dons the Batsuit for Jeol Schumacher's second outing as director following his less than spectacular Batman Forever. The promise? Bigger, bolder, better. The truth? Bigger, bolder, indescribably worse. Clooney plays Bruce Wayne as a schmoozing playboy, as far removed from the haunted and insecure Wayne of both Keaton and Bale as you can imagine. The presence of Robin is nothing short of painful as the pair of them bicker and complain like a couple of snot-ridden schoolgirls. Seriously, I was waiting for Clooney to put O'Donnell over his knee and spank him at one point, which might at least have been interesting. And as for the casting? Here's the worst part: I like Uma Thurman. I like Arnold SchwarzerGovernor. I like George Clooney. But here, the 'talent' is so pitifully poorly used it really should be a criminal offence. Thurman is an OTT hippie-chick who seems like she's just out of acting school, The Governor couldn't act his way out of a KFC bucket, true, but usually has some charisma. Here, zip. Silverstone, well, I have no opinion on her insignificant existence whatsoever....and I don't even know who Chris O'Donnell is. Thank the lord they killed the series here, to allow a director who understands the subject matter a chance to shine.Truly, truly. Truly. Dreadful.",Batman & Robin
197,BadWebDiver,Definite candidate for the worst movie ever!,1,9 July 2003,"This is deservedly one of the most despised films ever. It's pure mechanical delivery and product placement with barely an ounce of storyline to hold it together.(Spoiler Warning)I remember reading the critical reviews saying how bad the movie was, and going; ""Yeah right. Critics say that about all summer blockbuster action movies!"" (Well, they did at the time - constantly!) Then I watched the movie, and about five minutes in there's a scene where Mr Freeze zaps Robin with his ice-gun and turns him into an icicle. Then Batman runs up, and Mr Freeze says to him: ""Now you've got a choice, either rescue the boy or chase me."" (or something like that). Anyway, I remember thinking right there; ""I actually don't care if he walks away and forgets the whole thing! @#%$& it, the critics are right!""This may be an armchair director talking; but if I had done this movie, I would have at least wanted a pre-title sequence which set up the two main antagonists. Imagine Bruce Wayne at a cocktail party being his suave self; including a bit where a guest slips up and Bruce is asked to help. He replies ""Well, I'm not a doctor."" - an inside joke for George Clooney in reference to his 'ER' persona. Intercut this with extreme closeups of Mr Freeze tuning up his suit and barking orders at his henchmen to get ready, and then setting out for the heist. Then you run the titles, and THEN you get into the story. That way the audience is already perked up with anticipation in the characters and gives a hoot about what's going on. (It's basically the way the Bond movies work - even if you go to see the latest movie and it's your first time; you get a quick rundown on who this guy is, what he does and the fact that he's damn good at it).",Batman & Robin
198,David_Frames,"""and now comes the part where I relieve you, the little people, of the burden of your frail and useless lives""",1,18 June 2005,"Schumacher sold his sole to Satan when he inflicted this garish, neon-lit florescent pantomime on the world - as divorced from the source material and the spirit of the original film as anything could be, in fact the cartoon Batfink has more in common with the Batman comics than this noxious, overblown, infantile adventure into crude commercial interest. Broadly Batman & Robin is a remake of Schumacher's ever so marginally superior Batman Forever, a sequel which was fairly popular despite being the virtual clone of this reviled photochemical filth. So just why IS it so bloody dreadful? For a start it's astonishingly patronising to fans of the Dark Knight and fans of comic books in general. Akiva Goldman's screenplay, because I suppose we have to call it that, seems to assume that the audience will go and see absolutely anything provided its loud enough and bright enough. But as Tony Benn once remarked ""I don't believe in scapegoats"" so I'm afraid the people who are actually to blame are people like yourselves. You who went to see Forever 3 times, you who bought the video and the tie-in U2 single and yes you, the one who said it was all much more fun than the previous one. In fact everyone who partook in the process of making Forever the biggest box-office hit of 1995 was consciously and complicitly creating the commercial space in which this barely nourished and puerile spectacle would gestate. Schumacher said that it was the first film in which he's ever cared more about the money than the material, an hilarious assertion given that there isn't any material just cringe inducing puns, unbearable witless camp and a lot of white noise. In a rare case of life imitating art I knew a man who was actually a human cartoon, as witless, camp and overbearing as this movie and he rushed out to buy the box-set version on video, spending a fortune in the process. Proof that it isn't just owners and pets that sometimes resemble each other, it extends to people and bad movies too. Please, please please Warners, delete this.

Tim Burtons BatMan (1989) is awesome and this is not. I want to say thank you to Christopher Nolan for making BatMan awesome again and thank you Joel Schumacher for wiping your ass on the batman series (He said sorry about the film so apology accepted). Bane sucks in this movie like Dark Knight Rises (2012) for example bane in that movie don't suck like he made 10 times better than this filth.

200,MF210,The Worst of the Batman's,5,25 October 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. Batman and Robin is easily the worst of the Batman's. But one of the worst movies of all time? Thats kind of pushing it. Sure not a good movie but not quite bad. Nevertheless, this is a money-driven sequel that Hollywood is more than capable of giving us. The three Batman's combined would have made a solid trilogy but this Batman has sort of stained the Batman name.
The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was pretty good. My taste has matured and I can see whats wrong with it. It is simply an overdone movie. It overuses special effects to the point where they take over the story. The action sequences are not expertly done and it shows. Batman and Robin is an overproduced movie but its real problem lies in the script. This script gives us some really stupid dialogue. But it also tries to build a complex character out of the villain, Mr. Freeze. However, it doesnt work in the movie. This is because Arnold Schwarzenegger has limited range as an actor. He wouldn't be able to portray a complex character.
The rest of the cast is disappointing. George Clooney is easily the worst Batman. Chris O'Donnell is flat as Robin. Alicia Silverstone is irritating as Batgirl. There really is no need for Elle Machpherson here, except to admire her beauty. Uma Thurman is the only one to do a credible job. She is effective in an over the top performance as Poison Ivy.
The best thing I can say anout Batman and Robin is that its not really boring. If it was well made it might have been an entertaining action film. But its so screwed up that its no better than mediocre.",Batman & Robin
201,Meltdown53098533,They HAD to know they were making a terrible movie.... right??,1,27 January 2004,"Batman and now Robin have proved to be a successful team. but now the heat has been turned down when Mr. Freeze surfaces in a big way. he is out to steal diamonds and to find a cure for his wife. things get more complicated when Poison Ivy appears on the scene, whose ""beauty"" is her weapon against the male gender characters. things continue to escalate when Alfred comes down with a case of McGreggor's syndrome, and even more so when his niece shows up to spend a few nights at the mansion.RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IT'S A BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!Where to begin with this catastrophe. To begin, almost every action scene and concept is corny and ridiculous. Characters pole vault hundreds of feet into the air after taking 3 steps. Characters fall from 30,000 feet levels and claim they can land safely by landing in a giant furnace which has been frozen by Mr.Freeze. SPOILER at the climax, a giant telescope is somehow turned into a giant freezing gun that can deflect its rays off of space satellites. Mr.Freeze cannot live outside of sub zero temperature, and so he has a cold suit that requires diamonds to work. How in the hell do the diamonds power the suit? it's never explained.well..... let's move on to acting. George Clooney is in the wrong picture here. He doesn't know the character, and he doesn't fit. Uma Thurman plays the weak, nervous woman character to an incredibly annoying degree in the beginning of the film, and then transforms into a relatively good bad girl. Chris O'Donnel is alright here, but Alicia Silverstone is a mistake as well. She's a very boring super hero.Ah-Nuld Schwarzenegger has a lot of fun playing Mr. Freeze, and we like him the most out of all the characters. But his Mr.Freeze has learned the ways of his character from his 1985 movie ""Commando"": ridiculous strength, bad one liners and all. I really don't concur with the director's choice to turn Arnnie into another super strengthed douche.The script writers really don't know these characters very well. Bane, a giant muscular monster fuelled by steroids, was not a stupid buffoon in the comic books. he was a tactical, intelligent foe who was almost Batman's match. Alicia Silverstone's character wasn't even Alfred's nephew in the comics.in the end, it IS as bad as everyone says it is.

Director Joel Schumacher who walked out of the premier in
embarrassment, but really....was it all that bad?The answer is both yes and no but the negative vastly outweighs any
positives the film has to offer.The films script, if you can call it that is nothing more than a
collection of one liners. In fact almost all of Arnie's dialogue as Mr

cringeworthy. It's not even so bad it's good funny it's just bad, like
a low budget under 5's kids TV program except this film cost a lot of
money to make. The inaccuracies to the source material really ticked off the comic
book community. It's true that Burton didn't stick entirely to the
source either but he captured a lot of what the comic was about.
Schumacher doesn't have a clue and seems content with quick flashes of
Batman's arse to carry the film and zero sense of character depth

of the bunch being the wonderful Michael Gough having probably the most
screen time of all the Batman films. The sub-story of his illness and
the scenes that tell this are actually very moving and it's great to
see Michael have a chance to do something a bit more in depth. It must
be said also that George Cloony is an almost perfect fit for the role
of Bruce Wayne with his suave look and manner and his scenes with Gough
really have a lot of warmth but he is severely let down with the film
he is in.Other good points include some very nice sets, props and some great
designs for the look of Gotham City, though these too are marred by
garish lighting and wobbly fake looking ice.Uma Thurman clearly is performing tongue in cheek and as such get's a
way with it but even she cannot save the terrible surroundings she is
in.Somewhere deep in Batman & Robin there was a good film that was wanting
to get out and it could very well have been pulled off with the cast,
but campy humour and cheap laughs which weren't even funny completely
rob the film of anything it was trying to achieve in any of the more
serious scenes and unfortunately that's all people remember.Let this film be remembered as a lesson to studios, don't interfere

210,extravaluejotter,"Not the Worst Movie Ever, but...",2,10 April 2006,"For shame, Joel Schumacher, for shame. Within minutes of the start of Batman and Robin, I'd decided that I wasn't going to enjoy it. I was put off by the virtual cut-for-cut copy of the dressing scene from Batman Forever, featuring a tight close-up of the Dark Knight's rubber-clad buttocks. Straight away, I knew that there was more arse ahead.There is some diabolical over-acting in this film. Prime culprit is Uma Thurman, who must have watched all of the 1960s TV series as part of her research. She is about as sexy as a skinny woman in tight clothes, stupid makeup and bad wigs can be, but... I expect she had some fun making this film, but it's no fun watching her try to vamp it up on screen.There is also some diabolical under-acting. Step forward Alicia Silverstone. Admittedly, her part seems to be tacked on to the main story and she has to deliver some ropey lines, so maybe that's why she's so disappointingly wooden as Barbara stroke BatGirl. However, a film set isn't really the right place to have a sulk about your being mis-cast.Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze costume acts about as well as he does, but you can't expect Hamlet from the Terminator, can you?Adam West's Batman would have had the whole film sorted out Biff-Bam-Pow in 45 minutes, including ad breaks. George Clooney's almost-horizontally-laid-back Batman lets Joel Schumacher and the scriptwriter drag things out for over 2 hours. 2 hours of rubbish dialogue, pantomime action scenes, unconvincing special effects, cardboard villains and the palpable feeling that someone at Warner Brothers was happy to let the Batman franchise trickle away into the gutter.Thank God for Christopher Nolan and Batman Begins...",Batman & Robin

Alicia Silverstone was wasted in this film, as was Chris O' Donnell, Arnold Schwarzenneger is an unnecessary and stupid role, and why in the world was Uma Thurman in this movie, her character was hideous. There is no plot so i cant really review that, but i can say, it you liked the other Batman movies Ha, don't be surprised if you're disappointed. If you're a hardcore Batman fan, then you might like this one just a teeny weeny bit, but not as well as the other ones. I give Batman and Robin a 1.5 out of 10, the .5 is for Alicia Silverstone cause i think she's hot. Rated PG-13 for action and violence.

212,zacpetch,Why?!!!?,1,3 January 2015,"If this was released as a Batman spoof it would have been perfection. Sadly it's meant to be taken as a SERIOUS entry to the franchise! WHY SO SERIOUS, JOEL?The film opens with Batman & Robin (the former recast as George Clooney. No really. I'm not joking. I'll let Heath Ledger be a joker, it's not really my area.) looking at a newly designed Batmobile. ""Chicks dig the car"" says Robin. ""This is why Superman works alone"" says Batman. They drive off to confront Mr Freeze at a museum. ""The Ice-Man Cometh!"" he yells, the first of many ice related puns. The dynamic duo arrive to defeat him but his goons come running in. ""The Hockey team from Hell!"" Robin observes. He and Batman click their heels and their boots turn into ice-skates. The film turns into a nonsensical brawl/hockey match and this lasts for quite some time. Less than half-an-hour in and the tone has been set.The film also features two more villains in the form of Poison Ivy and Bane who both team up with Mr Freeze with the purpose of conquering Gotham, despite both wanting to do completely different things with it. The arctic is known for its many exciting flora. The film doesn't handle any of the three villains especially well, but its treatment of Bane is unforgivable. Forget that he's even in the film and you'll rarely notice any difference. Thank God for 'The Dark Knight Rises' which truly did the villain justice.Theses the perfect movie for annoying Batman fans but if you've not got 125 minutes to spare show them when Batman produces his own credit card (with 'Forever' written on it!) or any one of Mr Freeze's lines at random or any of Bane's scenes or any screen-time given to Alicia Silverstone's infamous Razzie award winning Batgirl.A necessary evil since it's indirectly responsible for the Christopher Nolan films.

213,wwe7961,Oh Boy,1,28 July 2010,"I like the 60's batman show, but that was then and this movie was 1997 3 decades later. Batman and Batman Returns set up the dark tone for the Batman series, but then it took a nose dive with Batman Forever. Then this movie came and the rest is history. The film has been hated more than any other comic based movie. Its cheese isn't fun or charming. The cheese is annoying, and it sent Batman in the wrong direction. George Clooney does seem like a Bruce Wayne kind of guy, but as Batman he doesn't change at all and doesn't give a good performance. Sad how such a good actor was in such a bad movie. Arnold plays Mr.Freeze. His lines are 95% ice puns, and his performance is terrible. Then there is the worst of them all Uma Thurman. She went from Pulp Fiction to this in 3 years now that's sad.

The outfits are shockingly bad, the direction looks like someone was trying to make a film on a stage set, the performances, two of them by Oscar nominees, are appalling. The script by Akiva Goldsman ranks as his absolute worst and remember this is the man who wrote Batman Forever, Practical Magic and Lost in Space.

217,C22Man,Sends the audience to the cooler!,2,23 June 2015,"Batman & Robin has become infamous as one of the worst films of its kind and the film that killed off the highly successful Batman franchise for 8 years until Christopher Nolan revived the series. It's easy to see why this failed massively. The biggest issue by far is the fact that there is an overload of camp which doesn't fit in at a time when fans wanted a more serious take on the character and it isn't helped by the writing being a total mess either. As a matter of fact the problems with the film are pretty much endless with boring heroes, over-the-top villains, ridiculous action sequences, overbearing visuals and an extremely bland plot. It's maddening how a series with such promise could end with such a disaster.Story: Batman and Robin have to contend with Mr. Freeze, who must remain in sub-zero temperatures at all times, as he plans on freezing Gotham City because of his wife's rare illness. Meanwhile Poison Ivy, along with her henchman Bane, appears in Gotham and is intent on driving Batman and Robin apart. Alfred's niece Barbara also arrives from England and the tension rises after Alfred becomes seriously ill. Once more the writers don't learn from past issues and there is again far too much going on to have a coherent story. The freezing Gotham plot is as obvious as it comes, the rift between the two heroes doesn't feel natural and Alfred's illness is clearly shoehorned in for more conflict. There are too many character threads, three new villains and another hero are introduced as well as developing the existing characters is too much to give each the time needed.Batman/Bruce Wayne: Of all the actors who could play the dark knight George Clooney would be near the bottom of the list. Apart from being somewhat suave and having a good chin there is nothing in his favour. When he's Bruce he's just George Clooney and when he's Batman he's George Clooney with a mask on. There is no threat, mystery or tragedy about his Batman, whilst his Bruce Wayne is far too smiley and playful. I just think Clooney is far too laid-back to truly convince in such a role.Villains: Arnold Schwarzenegger is truly horrid as Mr. Freeze and whoever cast him is nuts. Freeze is supposed to be cold and tragic with a burning anger toward everyone. But here all he does is crackle like a maniac and spew numerous ice-related one liners. Arnie is dodgy at the best of times so he fails immensely as Freeze, hell he should have been Bane. Uma Thurman is usually good and looks fantastic, but she is hamming it up to stupid levels and it doesn't work. Ivy should be a larger than life villain, but she is given terrible dialogue and randomly gets attached to the main story. 'Bane' here is just a big dumb thug who can only growl and there is no reason for him to be in this.Support: Chris O'Donnell is massively let down by the poor script, which results in Robin doing nothing but moan. Why would he can so much about being second best? It is incredibly forced and never comes across like a real conflict. Alicia Silverstone is bland as Barbara. She isn't helped by the script, but she's very wooden in the important scenes and not remotely believable as Batgirl. Michael Gough is the best thing in this as Alfred and delivers the most interesting scenes, whilst Pat Hingle's Gordon is reduced to a bumbling buffoon and adds absolutely nothing to proceedings.Action: The action scenes call back to the 60's TV show, but I think even that had more credibility with its fights. All the fight scenes just have Batman and Robin fighting off Freeze's goons or scuffling with Bane in a comedic manner which gets boring very quickly. One of the main fights involves ice hockey with a diamond, just reading that you know it's going to be stupid.Music: Elliott Goldenthal returns and his score isn't that different from Forever. In a sense that's okay because that score was pretty good, but it also stinks of laziness. The new tracks he brings in aren't very memorable either.Production: Visually the film follows Forever, but goes overboard with its colour scheme. Almost everything is fluorescent, there are giant naked statues littered about and there are gangs whose gimmick is being very brightly coloured. It looks impressive yet it doesn't fit the world Batman exists in. Plus I fail to see how he can lurk in the shadows in a city so bright. The costumes don't look great. The Batsuit is a bit too grey, Robin's suit is just a rip-off of the Nightwing design, the villain costumes look way too over-the-top and least we forget the nipples. The script and the dialogue are truly awful. All Mr. Freeze says is ice one liners, Poison Ivy just keeps referencing 'mother nature', Batgirl is just a dumb schoolgirl and any conflict between Bruce and Dick is extremely corny. The less said about the bat credit card the better.Conclusion: So there is effectively nothing good about this film and it doesn't even have value as being so bad that it's good. It is easy to see why is was such a disaster and left the series in the dumps for so long. Schumacher's direction is all over the place, Clooney is terribly dull, the villains are poorly done in every aspect, the visuals are overpowering and the dialogue is dreadful. It seems like every piece of the film from the casting to the writing was done in completely the wrong way. It all leaves a bad taste in the mouth and I find it very difficult to enjoy any area of the film. It's a shame Superman does work alone.",Batman & Robin
218,Kakueke,Keeps rollin' along,7,22 November 2001,"George Clooney moves in as Batman, and is the least-lookalike of Bruce Wayne of the three Batmans, but also refreshes by talking more like a regular person, less monotone.  He is a rugged Batman, but not overly dynamic, something we don't fully ever seem to get.  Poison Ivy was a very good villainness, to me a bit better than Catwoman in Batman II -- maybe I'm spoiled by Julie Newmar, maybe I'm just a man.  But I enjoyed the kiss and die, in which Uma Thurman's sexiness worked well, and the alluring botany theme. Something about botany, about flora, makes all of us more relaxed, one with nature?  Comfort in a film. But this contrasts with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.  Wooden and blah accent and rigid, the only more wooden thing being his puns (they are bad and poorly delivered).  There is something new as always: Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), giving us, interestingly, more heroes than villains.  All in all, enough to keep the Batman series interesting.",Batman & Robin
219,Mikew3001,Groovy superhero comic extravaganza,7,16 September 2002,"""Batman & Robin"" (1997) is the fourth part of the modern Batman series, directed again by popcorn movie director Joel Schumacher (""Batman Forever"", 1995) and starring George Clooney as Batman after Val Kilmer has left the series after only one Batman movie. Like his predecessor, ""Batman & Robin"" is leaving the original roots of Tim Burton's darker two Batman movies and moves more towards mainstream action and a more family-friendly fantasy adventure. Clooney's Bruce Wayne is much straighter and funnier than the psychologically disturbed and existentialist Batman performances by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. Although it reveals a bit more about Wayne's relationship to his butler and father-like friend Alfred, Clooney lacks the psychological depths of the first three movies. Chris O'Donnell returns for a second time as his sidekick Robin, appearing more like a wild rock'n'roll youngster than like a despaired artist's orphan out for bloody revenge. like in ""Batman Forever"". Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl takes the same way, being only a female Robin version, adding more sex to the superhero's league.This time, it's the villain's turn to show more psychological characters and sad background stories. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the real main actor of the movie, plays Mr. Freeze, a mentally and physically damaged scientist who became a super villain only to rescue the life of his beloved coma-state wife. He's no real bad guy, and it's his final turn to save the life of Gotham City.Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy has not only the function of a men-killing black widow but also the motivation of protecting the ecological balance of nature on earth. Her appearances are sometimes really stunning, taking fashion, music and dances of the tiki, lounge and exotica movement of the fifties and adding a campy b-movie touch to this mainstream movie.You see, compared to the first three Batman movies, the bad guys are rather good guys and have more interesting biographies like the good guys, this time with less personal problems and more shiny, muscle-dominated rubber suits on their hard-bodies. This could have been much more interesting, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movies.Another low point is the rather uninteresting image of the city of Gotham City - being a perfect background in the first three movies with elements of hammer horror castles, dark nightmare cities, a German expressionist-like modern ""Metropolis"" and an adaption of the disturbing paintings of Hieronimus Bosch or Enrico de Chirico, Schumachers Gotham City is just a dead background painting without the breeding darkness of the Burton movies.The sound track is well done, ripping of Danny Elfman's well-known leitmotif and adding some very fine alternative, pop and techno tunes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Underworld, R. Kelly and Moloko to the story.All in all it's the most mainstream-like and the most disappointing part of the new Batman movie series, but still much fun to watch (especially the buddy movie-like conversations between Batman and Robin). I hope they will return to Burton's original style in the forthcoming fifth part.",Batman & Robin

223,TheMovieDoctorful,"A Dreadful Film, But Not For The Reasons Most Often Cited",1,23 September 2019,"Almost everyone had slated Batman & Robin. It's almost become a cliche to bash on it. For once, I have to agree with popular consensus; Batman & Robin is a terrible movie. However, at the same time, I think it's terrible for reasons that very rarely get brought up. It's not bad because it's campy or because Batman's costume has nipples or because Arnold Schwarzenegger is Mr. Freeze. This film could retain all those aspects and still be good. Batman & Robin is bad because it's at war with itself. Nearly every potentially thought provoking or interesting creative decision is fundamentally undermined by another decision.For example, let's look at one of the most praised (and worst) scenes of the film; Bruce's conversation with his dying butler Alfred. In this scene, Alfred vents to Bruce that Batman started as a means to prevent mortality, but that Bruce must understand that even The Caped Crusader can't cheat death. It's an interesting and relevant point to the character, juxtaposed by 2 villains who are primarily motivated by a desire to preserve life. The problem is that not only does this scene have no payoff, but the story itself betrays its own messaging. In the end, Batman does save Alfred from death via an insulting Deus Ex Machina From Mr. Freeze. So, as it turns out, Alfred was wrong and Batman really can cheat death. God forbid we have anything but a happy ending for the kids, even if everything previously seemed to be setting up tragedy. To clarify, Batman & Robin isn't bad when it's being silly. It's bad when it's being serious.The film's confused and contradictory messaging can be felt in its villains as well. A story like this about the inevitability of mortality and our faulty attempts to prevent death calls for villains who cannot accept the fate of all living beings to die; Mr. Freeze is motivated by a desire to prevent his wife's death, Poison Ivy is motivated by a desire to protect the world's dying plant life. In theory, this should be genius, especially considering the fantastic casting of Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and, surprisingly, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze (who probably gives the best performance in the film). Again, the problem is in execution. Mr. Freeze will spend one scene crying over home movies of his wife and then the next scene laughing maniacally as he kills civilians randomly seemingly for the sake of slaughter. Freeze in this film is a character lacking in both motivation and in plan, there is absolutely no drive to him. This has nothing to do with ice puns and everything to do with faulty characterization.This brings us to Poison Ivy...Sweet Lilith, what a botch of potential. Thurman's wonderfully campy and energetic performance and fun costume design has little value against such shockingly atrocious writing. Writing that sees an feminist icon mostly motivated by her lust for a man to kill innocents. Writing that put many on the false impression that DC's most prolific ecofeminist is a genocidal monster (an endgame for the character not once preceded in canon DC Comics previously, now treated as a defining staple of the character by non-fans) It's telling that nearly every solid take on the character post-1997 has been marked by just how opposed it is to Batman & Robin's dumbed down and frankly misogynistic take on her, shifting her from a complex anti-heroine driven by her desire to preserve life into a grotesque straw man.Characters change and make big decisions here, but nothing is naturally developed. So many characters that should have had importance to this narrative feel like after-thoughts; predator Jason Woodrue being treated as a campy, queer coded mad scientist is the very definition of bad taste. I'm utterly convinced that Bruce's love interest Julie is only in the film because Schumacher & Goldsman were contractually obligated to include a love story, even one that goes absolutely nowhere where the love interest has a maximum of about 8 lines. The film has the pathos of a bad Mexican soap opera, which would be fine if it didn't get as pompous as it frequently does. It's all sound and fury and signifying nothing, Akiva Goldsman being the tale-telling idiot.",Batman & Robin

And when i heard that they were going make a fifth batman movie with George clooney i could not stop laugh i would have thought they would have known that George clooney wasn't right for the part as batman.

228,possumopossum,Ridiculous,4,22 January 2007,"The Governator as Mr. Freeze? I always thought of Mr. Freeze as being kind of a brainy old man, not a big muscle-bound lug. I did think the back story about his wife was very poignant. Made you almost feel sorry for him. (By the way, Arnold, you don't smoke cigars in a deep freezer. You'll damage the leaf.) In fact, I did feel sorry for Arnold Schwarzenegger because they gave him such lame lines. ""Freeze in hell, Batman."" ""Hell just froze over."" Telling cops to chill while shooting them with a freezer gun. UGGHH!!! Now, all I saw in this movie was a bunch of lame jokes, a lot of noise, and what the hell was that hockey game to get that diamond all about? That was the dumbest fight scene I think I've ever seen in my life. ""Let's not fight for the diamond, let's play hockey with it."" After seeing that, I wanted to get the puck out of there.Now, what is this? Batgirl? BATGIRL? Didn't these people learn from the mistakes of the creators of the original TV show? When Batgirl came on the show, that was when the series started to go downhill. Same for these movies. A bigger batcave? Batman couldn't even work with Robin.

229,rcolgan,What killed the franchise? The ice age!,3,8 August 2014,"Batman and Robin is an example in filmmaking of just about everything going wrong. It's often ranked among the worst films ever made. And for good reason. It's takes one of the greatest superheroes and turns him into a mess of annoying characters, ugly set pieces and enough terrible puns to make the worlds worst joke book. You know what you're in for when watching this film in the first 5 minutes. Because in that short time it shows us just about everything you wouldn't want to see in a Batman film. We get the first glimpse at bat nipples. Close ups of both Batman and Robins asses. A bat-mobile covered in neon lights. And the first of much horrible dialogue with Robin yelling in a whiny tone ""I want a car! Chicks dig a car!"" Five minutes in and you'll already begin to wonder who would give a 125 million dollar budget to make this film.After this the entire film pretty much follows the same tone, with everything that was cool about Burton's take on the caped crusader being taken away. The dark mesmerising visuals that felt like they came right out of a comic book are replaced by the mess of badly angled shots and bizarre colour schemes that make no sense. The incredible performance of Keaton is replaced by Clooney, who remain the worst on screen Batman to this date. Then there are the ridiculous fight scenes. They are a horrible sight to watch, with most of them seeming like a badly choreographed ice dancing sequence. The 1960's Batman fight sequences were more realistic than those ones were. Some were so badly choreographed that they would literally end in two movements. Then there's the villains. Not only are they as far from the source material as a film could get but they even lack consistency in the personality that the film gives them. Freeze will go from a sympathetic ""I have to be evil to save my wife"" character one minute, to heartlessly freezing innocents for no reason other than he felt like it. Similarly Ivy starts of wanting to save the plants but then teams up with Freeze to freeze the world. Because freezing the world is sure to help the plants. On top of this both do the exact same thing as Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever and try to copy Nicholson by being as over the top as possible. But the problem is it does not work for their characters. I'll put this down more to the script then the actors though. For example Freeze is supposed to be a cold emotionless figure, but instead has scenes where he's singing ""He's Mr snow!"" It's pretty hard to be emotionless and threatening with scenes like that. But I do wonder why the actors agreed to be in the film. Like how did a great actress like Thurman go from the cool and charming Mia Wallace to saying lines like ""My garden needs tending"" is beyond me. But by far the worst treatment is Bane. He went from the smart killer that he is in the comics to a mindless monster who's dressed up in a gimp suit. He didn't even serve any real purpose in the plot. His presence in the film seemed to be solely created for an extra action figure to sell. Though it's not just Bane who does this as during the climax the entire bat team changes costume between scenes. What the logic is in stopping to change when the whole cities in peril is thrown out the window like all other kinds of logic in the film. And there is only one person who could create this film so void of any form of logic or entertainment. Joel Schumacher. He is the sole mind weird enough to have thought of something as mind boggling stupid as a bat credit card. A man so unsuited for the franchise that his logic for casting Batman was whoever looked good in the cowl. This film ignores everything that Batman stands for to create this appalling piece of film-making. But for all its faults the film can still be fun to watch. Its actually amusing seeing just how wrong they got the entire film. If you're with some friends you can just sit back and joke about every horrible thing about the film from bat credit cards to those many freeze puns. Just don't watch this film expecting to see an actual Batman film.",Batman & Robin

Every suit has nipples, and Uma Thurman has two hair-cups on her head. Nothing about this is funny. There are dozens of lame ice and ivy puns, not to mention tongue-in-cheek references to other movies. George Clooney is a decent Batman, and I rather liked Alicia Silverstone (except for her insane biker side). Bane's character is reduced to a brainless monster, and Alfred's brother is named Wilfred.What an embarrassment of a movie. It wasn't even fun to make fun of.

From the bad acting to the terrible story this movie bombs in all places. Schwarzenegger is at his awful worst as is Uma Thurman and lets not get started on the way they portray Bane. Schumacher really should have been taken out and shot as should have been the producers. It seems that nobody had a brain cell and said wait stop, this movie is going to tank.

It's nice and colourful, and it makes even the most poorly edited of scenes at least nice to look at. Alfred gets a lot of screen time, and he's played to perfection by Michael Gough, who seems to be the only consistently good thing about this franchise. I hope he got a big fat paycheck for his role. Let's see, umm, the score is okay? Not as good as Elfman's but it's pleasant to listen to I guess. Umm, I'm really struggling, so I guess I'll list some negatives. So much of this film is just absolutely stupid that it's hard to take any of the 'emotional' moments seriously, the puns made me want to throw my laptop across the room and Batman and Robin's fighting is not only terribly written, but it's just unpleasant to listen to. I'm 99% percent sure that George Clooney is just CG here, and Alicia Silverstone being a British schoolgirl with a strong American accent basically sums up this entire movie; a mess.",Batman & Robin

So Warner Bros. decided to let him do another Batman movie. Thus, ""Batman and Robin"" was born.Boy, all I have to say is this: It's horrible. I can tell you 3 reasons why this movie is really bad:1: The acting is terrible. The Terminator and Uma Thurman as Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Seriously? 2: The visuals and action scenes were terrible. The visuals make this movie look like a kids film and the action scenes aren't that action packed. There mostly lame. and 3. The Costumes. Whatever happened to the original costumes? The one's in this movie are super lame. Literally.So in the end, ""Batman and Robin"", is just a horrible movie and it is best for you to stay away from this film.I gave this movie a one because IMDb dosen't let you give a movie a zero.",Batman & Robin
236,BlueSkies765,A kids movie,7,26 October 2019,"Batman & Robin unfairly gets trashed. I think people become purists and demand that the Batman story needs to be dark. I think adding diversity to the franchise isn't a bad thing. It gives choice to experience a different type of Batman.A less dark Batman story was actually done before. The 60s show was pretty goofy. Honestly if you think about it then why not? Batman is a comic after all.
This movie is so over-the-top and goofy that you got to know it's aimed at a young crowd. And they love these silly stories. The sillier the better. I avoided Batman & Robin when I was a kid because people said it was bad but honestly seeing it now I think I would have loved it. To me how you like this movie depends on your expectations.",Batman & Robin
237,mitchell5954,Punch in the face to Batman and Batman Fans,1,25 April 2013,"Batman and Robin is easily one of the worst superhero films ever created. The reasons why are numerous and obvious. Firstly, it is absurdly over-the-top, and kid-friendly. This feels more like and extremely long commercial rather than actual film. Batman Forever was more of a Batman movie than this. I remember, even as a kid, I hated this film.Secondly, the characters are awful. George Clooney is a horrible Bruce Wayne/Batman. There was nothing about his performance screamed Batman. Robin is whiny and aggravating. Chris O'Donnell, I heard did not like working on this film, and I do not blame him. Alicia Silverstone is not in the film that much. Her character, Barbara, is also nothing like the character Barbara Gordon.The villains are even worse. Arnold Schwarzenegger was horribly miscast. Mr. Freeze was a normal sized guy in the comics, and the animated series. Freeze was not a huge guy. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy was horrible as well. She was supposed to be attractive and sexy. Maybe it was the horrible costume, but I did not find her attractive at all in this movie. Bane was just the retarded muscle-man. He was nothing like his comic counterpart.One good thing about the film is that the production values are decent. However, the world looked very silly with all the neon lights. The action scenes are like something from a goofy cartoon like Looney Toons.Overall, this film is an insult to Batman and superhero films in general. Avoid this film at all costs. This is not only one of the worst superhero films ever made, but one of the worst movies ever made period",Batman & Robin
238,Derek237,This is obviously not the version of Batman people want to see,3,26 July 2006,"I can imagine that when most Batman fans saw this movie they could do nothing but stare incredulously at the screen and hope that maybe, just maybe it was all just a bad dream. And afterwards I'm sure they wondered how the hell could Batman turn from a dark and mysterious character to a silly character who has a utility belt of cheesy one-liners and who appears with his buddy Robin as a ""special guest"" at a Gotham charity auction. Most people immediately blame Joel Schumacher, and can feel their blood boil every time they hear his name uttered.Yes, Schumacher did do a terrible job. He found something that worked with Batman Forever and made a success, but took it way too far this time. This movie is a horrible miscalculation of the grandest of proportions. But, to be fair, everyone does a terrible job with the movie. The actors, the set designers, hell, I bet even the guy who brought the coffee and donuts to the set everyday screwed up somehow.You can't really say that this is unfaithful to the definitive version of Batman, because there isn't one. A character such as Superman is generally the same in all his incarnations, but batman has been interpreted in so many ways in so many different mediums that it's impossible to say which is the true. He has many different degrees of ""darkness."" The 60's TV show with Adam West portrayed the lighter side of Batman, and if it was this movie's goal to stay true to that spirit, then the mission was accomplished. All it missed was the inclusion of the ""KAPOW""'s. But be that as it may, there may not be a definitive version, but there is indeed a preferred version, and most people prefer the Dark Knight over the Caped Crusader or Dynamic Duo.I thought this was a bad movie with very little redeeming factors. However, I can't join the hoards of people who hate it with a passion and say it was a sin to mankind, I don't think it was THAT bad. It's even fun to watch and make fun of and wonder what they were thinking. Even Clooney can make fun of himself for being involved with this awful thing. The man won an Oscar this year, and in his speech he referenced it and joked about it. It's obvious that he's learned from his mistakes but has not forgotten them either. The same goes for the studios that made this movie. They learned from this mistake and ended up making the best Batman movie of all, Batman Begins. How can you argue with that? My rating: 3/10",Batman & Robin

Now I have seen it a second time with the Rifftrax sound running. With the help of the Rifftrax commentary the movie becomes almost tolerable. It still horrible and its hard to understand how so many good and mediocre actors managed to turn in such terrible performances, but at least it is funny now. After the second go round I can honestly say I believe the director's only real instruction to the cast was ""overact, make it so bad only the 5 and under crowd will like it. Be as bad as you can, people will love it."" The insane ""powers"" of the villains defy explanation... Mr Freeze needs diamonds to power a cold suit? He needs to ransom the city for money to fund his research, but he steals diamonds on a regular basis, why not use them for funding? Poison Ivy's skin was replaced with chlorophyll (which is a liquid by the way) and her blood with aloe??? Its almost as if they randomly picked some fan written story and never bothered to read it before pushing it through production.

241,TheSeaLion,"It's bad, but it's not the worst movie ever made",2,1 May 2014,"After the release of his two films, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", director Tim Burton was dropped as director by Warner Bros. and signed Joel Schumacher on as director. After the release of ""Batman Forever"" to much financial success, Schumacher was brought back on to direct the sequel that would be ""Batman & Robin"", and also become known as one of the worst films of all times. ""Batman & Robin"" is a campy disaster complete with bad performances, cringe-worthy lines of dialog, dumb characters, and distracting neon lights that annoyingly show during almost every scene.Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) are called to the Gotham City Museum to stop a robbery underway by freeze-ray wielding super villain Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Freeze manages to escape, putting a strain on Batman and Robin's partnership. Meanwhile, he deadly Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and an ex-con turned super soldier Bane (Jeep Swenson) head to Gotham in an attempt for Ivy's plan of saving the world's plants, and ends up forming a team with Mr. Freeze. From the one-line spurting Mr. Freeze to the bat-nipple wear Batman, the characters of the film are the largest problem with it. Schwarzenegger has the look of Mr. Freeze, but his acting talent is playing muscles-of- steel action heroes and does not posses what was needed to pull off the emotional and dramatic back story involving his mortally ill wife (Vendela Kirsebom). George Clooney possesses the elegant, playboy style of Bruce Wayne, but not the tormented and darker Batman. Bane in this movie is played as a bumbling idiot to serve as a strongman for the heroes to fight.The film tries to have the campy feel to it like the Adam West and Burt Ward show from the '60s had, but this attempt fails with the inclusion of Mr. Freeze's tragic back story and the subplot involving beloved butler Alfred (Michael Gough) dying.While the movie does have a reason to include every single one of its characters, with none of them included for fan service or just for the sake of having characters, the same can not be said about the vehicles and gadgets of the film, which exist solely for toys and marketing.""Batman & Robin"" is a brainless movie that relies more on flashy effects and marketing than it does on its story and characters. Yes, the film is bad and there were a lot of bad elements, but I would say this is more of a let down than one of the worst movies ever.

I can't even give Batman and Robin my usual good bad movie rating of 5 because it was actually trying to be campy. And it succeeds! The one-liners are ridiculous, the villains are cartoonish, and its all on a big budget. And sometimes, the silly tropes of comic books need to be laughed at.While Chris O'Donnell was annoying, most other complaints can be answered with ""Its not supposed to be taken seriously!"" Ice puns? Hockey fights? Bat credit cards? They all contribute to the light-hearted mood. If anything, it could have had more jokes.Why do people complain about this over Batman Forever? Batman Forever was both too serious and too campy. Even if Batman and Robin went in a direction most fans didn't like, at least it was interesting and consistent. If anything ruined the franchise, it was Forever.I thought the movie was fun. As manufactured bad, you can riff on it with friends with little dead air. Lighten up a little, bros.

To make it worse, it is a sequel in one of the highest-grossing franchises ever. For the third time, Batman is dreadfully miscast. The role is given to the aging George Clooney, who tries to bring wisdom and age to the role and instead bring more dullness and stupidity. Chris O'Donnell is terrible as usual as Robin. He tries to come off as a cool guy, but seems like a typical nerdy sidekick with cheesy lines. Alicia Silverstone is wasted as Batgirl, and does very little but try to look really good. These are the heroes, but the villains are even worse.Uma Thurman gives one of the worst performances in history as Poison ivy. She seems drunk the whole time and is very bizarre and unattractive. Arnold Schwarzeneggar is almost as bad as Mr. Freeze. He has more cheesy lines than a thirty-year-old Drivers-Ed video. The plot itself is repetitive and ridiculous, and it is filled with corny jokes and false urgency. We even get a glimpse of the super-strong Bane, but he does nothing except seem like an overgrown Frankenstein's monster.

It stripped away everything that represents Batman, severely underused the actors in this film (Schwarzenegger will never do Shakespeare, but he's done much, much better than this), the plot had more loops than a freeway, and was just blatantly hokey. It came across as less of a film and more of a gimmick to buy Bat-merchandise. Shockingly, it overshadows the '60's TV series so much in the ""camp"" value that it makes the old show look like a serious depiction. Burton's and Danny Elfman's contributions are sorely missed.If there is ever a Batman 5, have the people who write the Animated Series work on the script, and have Tim Burton do the art direction.

As an actor he is simply wretched and has been in every single thing I have ever seen him in. In From Dusk to Dawn he demonstrated a special hollowness unique to him. Like Oakland, there is no there there. Just compare as I had the opportunity to do this very night, George with Val Kilmer playing the same character. George has zero, no make that minus zero, going on behind the eyes. Val is interesting. George is BORING. He is almost always boring. Forget the desperate Hollywood hype. George lacks Newman's charm. He lacks Gibson's intensity. He lacks Tom Selleck's warmth (he even seems to be chilled below normal body temperatures) and he even lacks Cruise's boyishness. As Batman, George not only lacks ""superness,"" he even lacks normal ordinariness. He actually has zilch appeal for me and based on his real box office, I don't think that is an especially rare opinion. I could keep this up almost indefinitely so I'd better stop. All I can say is George, please stop while you still look good because it hurts to even think of having to watch you a few years from now even for a minute as I surf through stations avoiding even looking at your smug mug again.

247,Newsense,The Rocky Horror Picture Show of superhero movies,1,24 August 2008,"Once again Joel Screwmacher was allowed to handle another Batman movie and under his direction plunged a promising series into cinema hell. Batman Forever was proof that something foul was afoot for the Batman series. For the record I never heard anything about how bad this movie was until I brought the DVD(like a fool) and experienced for myself. Afterward I searched online and found tons of reviews on Amazon as well as other websites slamming this movie. Before I start: to the little ADD afflicted kid who thinks this movie is better than Batman Returns, STAY OFF THE GLUE!!!Plot: Mr Freeze(played by Ahnuld) wants to turn Gotham as well as the world into an icebox. Poison Ivy wants to help him destroy the world while populating the planet with her freakish plants. Batman(played by George Looney) and Robin(played by Chris O'Donell)with the aid of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone) are out to stop them.Opinion: This is the worst superhero movie of all time. Having George Clooney play Batman is like having Pauly Shore or Brandon Fraser play James Bond. Chris O'Donell's character Robin is such an annoying bratty punk. Uma Thurman does her worst Mae West impression as Poison Ivy and I'm convinced that Quentin Tarentino's peculiar attraction to her saved her career from extinction because crappy movies like Batman& Robin, Even Cowgirls Get The Blues and The Avengers could have easily sunk her career into obscurity. Arnold gives the worst performance of his acting career as well as Alicia Silverstone(and thats saying a lot for Alicia). The biggest offense is turning Bane a.k.a. ""The Batbreaker"" into a bumbling idiot who mumbles everything being said to him. You know a movie is in trouble when the only character you care for is the butler Alfred(played by Alfred Gough), who might be dying. The fluorescent atmosphere of this movie is an eyesore, hell, the whole movie is an eyesore itself. The Joel Blublocker Batman movies are a reason for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight's existence.

Even George Clooney can't save the movie as the caped crusader. But the worst comes from Chris O'Donnell, who's terrible as the Boy Wonder, and Alicia Silverstone who sucks as Batgirl.

Yet, it is with 'Batman & Robin' that he fully achieved his objective.The franchise's world, so creatively created by Burton, is now a complete mess; very dark and Gothic remnants from Burton mixed up horribly with colorful structures that are an eyesore. Terrible, laughable special effects. Not just badly used, but silly, overly phony and very outdated. The story is forgettable; the writer tries to cram up far too many plot points in there and ends up with a mess. Furthermore, he seems to have based himself only on the silliest part of comic books (Bat Credit Card... 'nuff said). No development, at all, of the characters. Hero-wise that is a problem present even in Burton's films, but considering the number of main characters crammed up in here it becomes impossible to ignore.To complete the screenplay, an atrocious dialogue. Seriously, take ANY dialogue from the film. Doesn't matter if you have the context or not, it is terrible. No, wait, 'terrible' would be a compliment. It is cheesy, completely lacking in the wit or cleverness it apparently believes itself to have; the terrible out-of-place jokes and the delivery makes it even harder to stand.The cast is equally atrocious. George Clooney makes Val Kilmer look Oscar-worthy; he plays the same 'perfect' little charming pretty-boy he usually does and totally forgets what the hell this Batman character is supposed to be (the fact he keeps grinning like a loon is also irksome). He manages to upstage Chris O'Donnell in terribleness, and Chris again plays the same clichèd angry teen that acts like a kid most of the time (even worse, there is a ridiculous fight between the two because of Poison Ivy!).Alicia Silverstone... How was she supposed to be a Batgirl like that? She is good looking and not necessarily a bad choice, but looks and talks as if she was still in 'Clueless'. Michael Gough is a lot better here and, despite the contrived subplot he is in, the only one to do a good job; he is outstanding, even, by this film's standards.Villain-wise, another crap-fest. Uma Thurman, who is usually a very bland/bad actress to me (the only exception being in Tarantino's films), is totally absurd as the nerdy Pamela Isley and even worse as the supposedly sexy Poison Ivy. She overdoes every scene she is in, and is unbelievable in each one of them.Arnold Schwarzenegger is a joke as Mr Freeze. His success as an actor sterns from his physique that makes him a perfect choice for action roles; however, Freeze is supposed to be a serious scientist with a highly dramatic and emotionally sympathetic life-story; however, he acts nothing like that and becomes just a 'Terminator'-esque, pun-cracking goofy villain. Seriously, there are many super-strength using Batman villains; couldn't he have played Bane instead, for example?Wait, who is that henchmen of Ivy? IS THAT FREAKING BANE?!?!Overall, Schumacher destroyed the franchise here and put his name on history as the director of, arguably, the worst film of all time.",Batman & Robin

In this new installment in the Batman franchise, Batman and Robin must overcome their issues with each other in order to defeat Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Now this is the second time that Joel Schumacher has directed a Batman movie after Batman Forever. But this time there's no Tim Burton serving as executive producer, which means that Joel Schumacher has complete control of everything. Now I liked Batman Forever despite it having some issues, but at least Batman Forever had a story that maybe wasn't what I expected, but at least it did its job. But in this one, Joel got high on his own supply and took everything that we witnessed in Batman Forever and put it on overdrive. This movie is so bad it makes the 1960s Batman look like a masterpiece, which it is by the way. If Adam West and Burt Ward could've witnessed this monstrosity they would hang their heads in shame. And this would be the last Batman movie until Batman Begins because after that experience it was time for Batman to get cleaned up and get his act together. Can't say that I blame the studio for wanting to put Batman in rehab. Everything about this could've had so much potential, but it was a wasted opportunity. This movie feels more like something that sells toys in a MacDonald's happy meal, than a Batman movie. Nobody involved with this looked like they were interested in making this monstrosity either as many interviews have stated that they thought they killed the Batman franchise. However with all bad movies I like to see the silver lining in everything and the one good thing about this horrific film are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Uma Thurman. These two looked like they were having fun or at least pretending to have fun since they were paid millions of dollars. These two bring all the puns you can imagine and bring them to the big screen that it becomes cringe worthy, but in a good way. I'm going give this film the benefit of the doubt and say that this is not a terrible Batman film. The award for the most terrible Batman film is the Dark Knight Rises, but that's a different review. At least this movie can still put a smile on my face, while the Dark Knight Rises makes me feel depressed and miserable. So in the end, this isn't a bad Batman film.

I guess that it's this declaration which fuels ""Batman & Robin"", one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Starring three heroes as well as three villains (let's rather say two and a half), ""Batman & Robin"" is at the same time the fullest and the emptiest episode of the Batman series, fueled by unequaled pretensions and ambitions and obtaining results which are nothing more than pathetic.Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) are facing Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a college professor whose research to find a cure to the fictitious MacGregor syndrome (from which his wife suffers) has gone terribly wrong, provoking a mutation which makes that he cannot survive anymore to temperatures higher than zero.Meanwhile, Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) becomes another victim of mutation after his colleague professor tried to kill her. She transforms into Poison Ivy, a nature beauty whose charms bewitch men and whose kisses are venomous.Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy have totally opposite plans and have apparently no reason to team up, but that's what happens anyway and Batman and Robin have to thwart their evil plans.Add Bane (Jeep Swenson) who was once one of the most intimidating villains of the comic books, but is now a simple non-talking savage who takes the part of Poison Ivy's servant. There's also Barbara (Alicia Silverstone), the niece of butler Alfred (Michael Gough), who discovers the ""family secret"" and joins in the action under the name of Batgirl.The movie lasts for two hours and five minutes, but five minutes are wide enough to convince anyone of the foolishness and the absurdity of this mediocre film. And not necessarily the first five minutes. Anywhere in the movie, we can find ludicrous sets, poorly conceived action sequences and one-dimensional characters, all of this is leaded by an abysmal script from Akiva Goldsman and directed by Joel Schumacher of whom we could ask if he really had the taste and the motivation to proceed to the production of this movie.When you look at the actors, you could ask yourselves why Arnold Schwarzenegger is top-billed. In the 1989 ""Batman"" movie, it was worth it because Jack Nicholson (as the Joker) was by far the greatest actor of the lot. In the case of ""Batman & Robin"", I guess that it's the actors' salary which determined their position in the credits since Schwarzenegger received about $20 million for his role.The question now is: why did he receive so much money for such a shabby performance? His terrible one-liners and puns about ice have become instant classics, but for the wrong reasons. His plans doesn't make any sense and where do these henchmen come from and what is their interest in working with a man whose only interest is to save his sick wife? There again, ""suspension of disbelief""...Uma Thurman plays the Mother Nature role in this film, but with such a performance, her credibility has been just passed under the lawnmower.As for George Clooney, it's not his performance that is disappointing, but rather the fact that he plays a character he's not made to play. He's probably the most charming Bruce Wayne of the series, but also the least interesting, since he doesn't display any tortured soul or psychological scar. Those characteristics have been better handled by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. And his girlfriend Julie Madison (Elle Macpherson), where does she come from and what is her role here? The only good point about Clooney came well after the movie's release when he famously declared: ""I think we might have killed the franchise."" Well, a fault confessed is a half redressed.As for the two young heroes O'Donnell and Silverstone, they're not bad, but not interesting either.The city of Gotham, previously a very Gothic city filled with Metropolis-inspired expressionist buildings, is now assaulted by ridiculous skyscrapers and monuments shaped like giant people, whose origins go back to ""Batman Returns"" (remember the Max Shreck speech in the beginning?).The Batmobile is almost unrecognizable and is now a convertible, just like if somebody intended to mix the vehicle of the '60s TV series with the one from the Tim Burton films. Batman and Robin own an upgraded arsenal of completely silly technological gadgets, the worst being the skates magically going out from their boots. And what could I say about their costumes equipped with dim-sized nipples and filmed with useless close-ups on their posteriors? It's difficult to pick up the worst scene of all, since there are so many of them. But there are three which go above the others. Bronze medal: the scene at the end where Batman tries to convince Mr. Freeze to abandon his quest for revenge is utterly pathetic. Silver medal: the auction where old bachelors bet on girls with flower nicknames look like a convention of luxe pedophiles looking for prostitutes. It's not only ridiculous, it's offending. And the gold medal: this image of Poison Ivy holding a flower with a viper head seems to be taken from an Ed Wood picture.It is so sad for Batman, whose franchise has known very glorious and happy times, that he has to be treated so miserably by people having more interest for their wallets than for the fate of one the most appreciated superheroes in the world. And for movie fans, I think I've just said it, but the movie is not only ridiculous, it is offending.And since Mr. Freeze seems to have a knack for ice-related puns, here's one more: this movie will leave you cold.",Batman & Robin

When i first saw this movie I liked but I thought it was the worst of the Batman movies. Now I view it again and I think it just sucks.George Clooney sucks as Batman, he is by far the worst Batman. Val Kilmer was a mediocre Batman but George Clooney is much worse. Chris O'Donnell's performance as Robin went downhill in this one. Alicia Silverstone is completely dreadful as Batgirl or whoever the hell she is. Arnold Schwarzenneger is also awful as Mr Freeze, they over did it on the make up. Uma Thurman wasn't half bad as Poison Ivy, she is the only good part of this movie. This movie has so many problems cause of its crappy script. The Direction is poor too, Joel Schumacher did a better job with Batman forever. Overall, this is a failed film but not quite a complete disaster. I thank Uma Thurman for that.",Batman & Robin
255,eamon-hennedy,"I ask you God, what have we done to deserve this?",1,8 December 2003,"This is hands down the worst film ever made in the history of the existence of the universe. There have been some bad films made but this is a travesty. It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film. The casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would  have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.The blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes.",Batman & Robin

Batman and Robin is definitely the weakest film of this saga. Not only that, but the magic that was Batman is completely destroyed in this film - the BatVisa? Come on! He's supposed to be the Dark Knight, a near-mythical presence in the Gotham underworld. Instead they have him making appearances at public events. This is also the silliest of the four. Due to its bright flashy environments, and some of the more ridiculous bat-gadgets, it feels exactly a Saturday morning cartoon translated too literally to the big screen. A filmmaker has to know better than that. Arnold Schwarzenegger...oh, there's a criticism waiting to happen. I bet good money that this would be the movie he most regrets making. Mr Freeze, due to access to technology, is potentially one of the more capable villains in the Batman roster, but he comes off so cartoonish in this movie. I have to say I certainly wasn't impressed. But this is one of those paradox movies - You want to watch it because sometimes it's fun to watch a movie that is really bad. It's just how our minds work.",Batman & Robin

We have been cursed with a dreadful movie like Batman and Robin. First of all when you have a league of villains played by Uma Thurman and Arnold, you mostly expect a great film. Not! Uma is painful as the sexy villain Poison Ivy and Arnold is a big gay ice cube. And what is with the henchman Bane? He was cool in the cartoon but in this movie...gross! We have George Clooney playing the hero, bad choice! Clooney can't act a penny and is horrible as Batman. Chris returns for more as the sidekick and he's cheap, nothing but a teenage kid trying to get the girls as a super hero. ""The chicks love the bike."" Yeah right. Then we put in Batgirl, vomit! We have Alfred dieing and Arnold playing Mr. Freeze has the cure? The graphics are Sci Fi channel worth but for a major motion picture? Froozen city's, evil potions of poison, a dead broad floating in a tube of melted jell-o ice, stupid! Boy did this film leave a big stain on the Batman carpet. Bad casting, bad story, and bad special affects. The action is enough to please little kids. I liked the film when I first saw it when I was six and five years later...Bad!

So I gave the movie a shot hoping its just a guilty pleasure, but no, it was really bad. The dialogues, the writing, almost everything was ridiculous.

In any case, it really isn't a bad flick - I have about 3000 Batman comics, read 'em all, they haven't made A ""true"" Batman movie, but for the four that they have made - I'd rank this as #2 of the 4 - first being Batman (an 8 of 10), this one I rank a ""7"" and the two others ""7's"" as well.

The acting is absolutely hilarious and every bit as campy as the rest of the film.The magnificent actors all give hilarious over the top performances as very eccentric and flamboyant characters that are every bit as corny and fun as The Evil Dead.The action screams out it's homage to the random gadgets and MacGyver like use of surroundings in the 1970's TV series.The script is purposely terrible you can tell as Schumacher picked out every one liner possible and made a script out of them.I honestly can't believe people took this seriously and to heart i think it's better than both of Burton's films which were also cheesy and over the top but with a far too serious tone but because Tim Burton's name was there no one will consider it bad.Burton is extremely overrated because we all know it was Jack Nicholson who carried the 1989 film.Overall it's funny, it doesn't take itself seriously at all yet stubborn people without a sense of humour label it as an ""atrocity"" I've actually read that somewhere...sad.Giving this a bad review because it was cheesy is like giving a bad review to Evil Dead, Freddy vs Jason, or Mars Attacks!.Overall a perfect Batman parody and a good homage to the awesomely cheesy 70's show all that was missing was a little POW!

261,rowanmaillot,R.I.P Joel Schumacher,8,28 June 2020,"Batman & Robin is one of my all time favourite movies! George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger deliver the performances of a lifetime! Okay, jokes aside, this movie is pretty laughable, Joel Schumacher directed a far more brighter and colourful Batman movie compared to the darker Tim Burton approach. When I was around 7, this used to be my favourite Batman movie! Not even gonna lie, then I got around to becoming a film-lover and realised how bad this movie really is! The only reason it gets an 8 is because Schwarzenegger actually makes the movie funny, George Clooney's suit is kind of nostalgic for me in all honesty and some of the camera angles are pretty dope, ngl. This is also the movie that brought us the Nolan Batman trilogy which is 2000 times better than this piece of... *masterpiece* (of) cleverness and absolute genius! A serious R.I.P to the man, the myth, the legend, Joel Schumacher, who should not be remembered for this.. ahem, *masterpiece*, but for his other brilliant work like Batman Forever (yeah, to be honest I kinda love that movie), A Time To Kill, Falling Down, 8mm, Phone Booth, Phantom of the Opera and many more.

262,tml_pohlak_13,Awful to say the least,1,29 August 2008,"""Batman and Robin"" is the disaster of the century- nay, the millennium! This movie was terrible to say the least. The opening sequence began promisingly, as Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) tries to steal a diamond, but Batman and Robin (Clooney and O'Donnell) interfere with his plans.However, the movie goes downhill as soon as the scene shifts to South America. The introduction of Poison Ivy (Thurman) and Bane (Swenson) was poorly executed to say the least. (In fact, Bane seems to have been raised by monkeys or something. His communication is limited almost entirely to grunts or growls.) Having said that, Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Mr. Freeze is sacrilegious. He is now a man armed with a big gun, constantly speaking a never-ending river of puns involving ice or cold. And Clooney's Batman is TERRIBLE! For example, he tells Robin that Alfred is dying. And when the camera cuts to him, he has a ridiculous grin on his face!However, there are two bright spots, as far as acting is concerned. The first is Michael Gough as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's ever faithful butler. As with every movie, he really makes the character his own. It was tragic to see him in such a disaster, but he tried his best. Second, I was quite surprised at Alicia Silverstone's acting. Sure, her character was completely ineffective and unnecessary, but she seemed to be the only one who CARED that the movie was a disaster. Ineffective as her character was, she still did a decent job. But not even their Heraclean efforts prevented the movie from being a disaster.As to the plot itself, it is very poorly written. It has all the elements of a good superhero movie... NOT! The childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin, and Poison Ivy is so terribly executed, you begin to wish Ivy'd just kiss them both and finish the movie.In short, if anything happens to prevent you from seeing the movie; if your television breaks right before you press ""Play""; heck, if you're run over on your way to the video store, you have been saved by a miracle!

He seems to go out of his way to hate everything made after 1966, whether music or movie or theater.  But when he calls Alicia Silverstone an ""inelegant nonactress""........I can't top that.  Silverstone is absolutely dreadful, and two of her co-stars, Chris O'Donnell and the Mighty Ahnold, are only inches better (am I the only one who finds Chris O'Donnell about as cutting-edge as mayonnaise on white bread?).George Clooney is the supposed star of the picture, even though he gets second billing.  He does the best he can, but the dialogue is so stilted that he doesn't have a whole lot to work with.  But Uma Thurman.......Uma is fierce.  She makes this movie as enjoyable as it is, because the woman can vamp like no one since Mae West.  She is tremendous fun to watch every second she's on the screen, and she captivates you even as you cringe at the horrid dialogue.The story itself is padded and cliche-ridden--the motorcycle race sequence could be dispensed with without losing much, and the you-don't-trust-your-own-partner and dear-friend-is-dying-of-an-incurable-disease bits have been done before, and much better.

264,cwrdlylyn,BATMAN & ROBIN: So Campy It's Definitely Entertaining... Just Not Necessarily Good,7,30 August 2006,"BATMAN & ROBINUnanimously deemed the worst BATMAN film in the franchise, the fourth installment is crushed by the weight of Joel Schumacher obsession with glitz and superfluous sequins. BATMAN & ROBIN follows the Dark Knight as he embarks on a partnership with Robin. There partnership is tested as they take on the evil Mr. Freeze (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the seductress Poison Ivy (played by Uma Thurman). BATMAN & ROBIN has received more flack from critics and audiences then I would ever lay upon it, because to me the film is a good deal of fun to watch. It certainly could have used a dose of tranquilizer or something to calm down the manic camera-work and the over-the-top production design. However, at times BATMAN & ROBIN is a very entertaining movie... sometimes as a decent action movie and something as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie.The thing with BATMAN & ROBIN is that it's drenched with the stink of Schumacher's awful direction. What audience did this man think was going to see this film as he filmed close ups on Batman's ass in the suit... or Robin's codpiece? Did he honestly think fans of Batman needed to see all the campy razzle-dazzle in a film about someone known as the ""Dark Knight""? And what was Schumacher thinking when he cast Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl? Watching this movie I feel bad for the girl as she looks like a deer-in-headlights at every turn. But while half of the blame for this film's failure should be blamed on Schumacher... the other half should be blamed on the script-writer. If ever there was an unbalanced Batman screenplay this is it. The script creates villains that couldn't be played as anything other then camp. But meanwhile, it creates such a dramatic storyline regarding Batman's butler Alfred that requires the heroes to be played in a very serious manner. Unfortunately, as a result, George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell offer the most awkwardly inhabited performances of their very different careers.Nonetheless, the saving grace of the film is Arnold and Uma. As Mr. Freeze, Arnold Schwarzenegger clearly has fun playing an incredibly exaggerated version of himself. There is nothing subtle about Mr. Freeze, from the costume, to his abilities, to dislodge like ""A storm is coming"" and much more. However, Schwarzenegger pulls it off with a genuine sense of fun. And Thurman as the seductive Poison Ivy has never been this fun before or since. Granted, Thurman has offered better performances in other films... but she has never succeeded at capturing such a sense of fun abandonment. Her Poison Ivy is incredibly one-note, but that one-note is the most captivating piece of entertainment in the film.The villains are so much fun they make the entire movie watchable. But watchable does not equal satisfactory. It goes against all logic that the audience for a comic-book film would root for the villains, and yet that's how Schumacher's BATMAN & ROBIN plays. In a way, it's so easy to write a bad review for this film, and yet it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over. Because the film's faults are so blatant, it adds to the camp factor. However, watching BATMAN BEGINS, it becomes clear that any quality Batman movie should never be defined purely by ""campiness"". ... C+ ...",Batman & Robin

Sure, with the film's predecessor, 'Forever', there was some potential. Val Kilmer was the new Batman, the story wasn't too bad, but the Adam West-ish fun and glow in the dark vehicles just didn't fit.Oh boy! Now comes George Clooney to provide a quick fix. Now, I'm not going to say that George didn't play a good caped crusader, he just had a very poor film to do it in. Being the third actor to play the role in three films didn't help either. It certainly didn't help Roger Moore taking over for Bond, but he at least had a chance to make up for it.Glow in the dark cars boats and planes just doesn't work for a guy who travels at night by stealth.Uma and Arnold... yes comic villain genius, in an Adam West world.Yes, in the minds of comic book film fans and especially Batman fans, Shumacher will rot in hell for all time.

266,sc8031,Let's write a serious review for a superhero movie!,2,8 September 2008,"The weird, goofy, offbeat moments of humor occasionally found in the prior film ""Batman Forever"" make up the entirety of this Batman's dialog and backdrop. It's certainly one of the weirder superhero action movies for its humorous angle. If someone had really good MST-3K dialog to put over this film it would be pretty entertaining. But as it stands, where you're left to make your own jokes about the movie, it's not very much fun.The sad thing about this movie is that it had the potential to be a really entertaining high-budget ""B"" movie. It looks like that's what it was going for, considering the hokey script full of stupid one-liners and the ridiculous stunts that have no bearing whatsoever in reality. To that end it is kind of entertaining -- almost a throwback to the Adam West series and movie from the 1960s.But Joel Schumacher and company chicken out of making real fun of themselves. Had this movie been made more in the vein of ""Army of Darkness"" it would've been much more appealing. Unfortunately, we get schmaltzy moments of affection between Alfred and his niece, Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), a really unnecessary Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and the unbelievably hilarious Mr. Freeze (Arnie). I swear, every line out of Freeze's mouth is so stupidly funny -- it makes you want to smoosh him. And casting George Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman is pretty nuts. It's like casting Chevy Chase or Frank Sinatra.When watching this I really felt about it the way I did about the original 1966 Batman movie: I thought the filmmakers were on psychedelic drugs. Well, at least this one is impressively sub-par; this way it isn't entirely forgettable!",Batman & Robin
267,charlessmith702210,Flick combines action with some drama,6,24 June 2006,"What I like about ""Batman and Robin"" is a combination of drama as well as the action sequences often seen from these Marvel Comics characters.Actually, about 33 percent of the movie focused on Alicia Silverstone, who wants to join in the fun of the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder.She had enough computer engineering skills to break into the password-protected computer that allows Batman and Robin to access the batcave---and eventually---she becomes Batgirl. What a twist!A turn for the worst hits Uncle Alfred as he gets hit with MacGregor Syndrome--Stage 1. MacGregor Syndrome? I think of this MacGregor Syndrome as something taken out partially from the ABC TV series ""Gray's Anatomy"", but I can only speculate that this disease is a cross between Alzheimer's disease, MS, and a twinge of Lou Gehrig's disease. The evil Victor Freeze, who was a scientist who escapes from Arkham Asylum...and then comes back again caught...and escapes, is forced at the end of the movie to put an end to Uncle Alfred's malady.....Eva Thurman, who plays Poison Ivy, an evil woman whose kisses cause instant death to anyone who gets exposed to it, eventually teams up with Victor Freeze, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Robin is, at one time, forced by Poison Ivy into kissing her but his rubber lips prevented him from ingesting her fatal poison.Therefore, I believe Batman and Robin is a little spin off to ""Batman Returns"", where Batman faced a double dose of villianry by way of Catwoman (played by Michelle Pfieffer) and The Penguin (played by Danny Devito). Batman and Robin, however, suffers a little bit of boredom because there is less action than that of ""Batman Returns"", even though ""Batman and Robin"" does have an unusual motorbike race scene.",Batman & Robin

269,ericjg623,Not THAT bad ....,5,9 October 2002,"OK, it was not all that good, either, but I don't see why THIS particular movie is much worse than any of the other Batman sequels. I mean, they all pretty much stick to the formula established in the original - Batman is an angst ridden superhero who has to confront a series of bizarre super-villains and there's a (usually blonde) love interest, all of which takes place in the weirdest metropolis this side of Toontown, Gotham City. What made the first ""Batman"" notable was simply the sheer originality of it, that plus we got to see Jack Nicholson having the time of his life playing the cackling Joker. The next three, as far as I'm concerned, all rank about the same. Of course, not being a comic book aficionado, I never took the whole Batman concept seriously in the first place, so the fact that these movies tend to be goofy and a bit ridiculous isn't necessarily a bad thing. As for the acting, well, everyone seems to be beating up on the stars, most notably Clooney, however, I happen to agree with Ebert that it's really not that important who plays 'Batman', the main thing is simply to find someone to fill the suit. I guess the bottom line for me is that I just don't watch a movie like this expecting anything serious regarding the plot, the acting, the writing or the characters. I mean, this isn't 'Saving Private Ryan'; it's much more in the same category as 'Charlie's Angels'. As such, Batman 4 is basically OK entertainment and nothing more.5/10",Batman & Robin
270,jiangliqings,Painful to watch.,1,20 January 2001,"1/2* out of ****As I think of it now, Batman and Robin is perhaps the worst big-budget disaster of the past decade.  At a production cost of 110 million dollars, this is an overbloated and and ineptly made stinker that strays from as far away as the original film as any movie could possibly do.  I always count on the fact that in most summer action movies, there's at least something that can past for as a redeemable factor, but going over this movie in mind, I find nothing worthwhile.Normally, in the reviews I write I state the plot, but I think I'll refrain from doing so with this movie's ""storyline"".  Basically, all it is is Batman (George Clooney) having to take down the villainous likes of Mister Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and Bane.  This time, he has the help of Robin and newcomer Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), so the odds have been evened up.And all I really have to say is who cares?  Batman and Robin is a deliriously awful action movie that manages the tough task of being mind-numbingly dull with non-stop action at the same time.  Watching this movie only makes me yearn for Tim Burton to return the franchise, because Joel Schumacher, with the help of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, is ruining the series.  To some extent, it seems almost as if though the both of them want to stray from as far as possible from the 1989 original.  They don't seem to realize what was appealing about the Batman character was the dark tone, his psychological need to take down criminals, and the fact that he was a loner. Adding Robin in Batman Forever was a mistake, but the addition of Batgirl is at least twice as bad.  Speaking of the characters, that takes me to the performances, which are downright awful, enforced only by the equally atrocious dialogue (we get classics like ""it's the hockey team from hell!"" and ""Adam and Evil!""). George Clooney has definitely been the worst choice so far as both Batman and Bruce Wayne.  He shows none of the quiet intensity of Michael Keaton, and turns his character into a cheerful rich man, far from the brooding and haunted figure Bruce Wayne and Batman should be.  Schwarzenegger hams it up to no end, and I suppose that's a little better than a flat performance, though I did hear the part of Mr. Freeze was originally written for Patrick Stewart, which sounds like a much better choice for the villain.  Uma Thurman is equally over-the-top, and Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone are a painful to watch duo.  Even if the performances are bad, there would still be hope if the sets, special effects, or action scenes were any good.  Unfortunately, there's none of that in quality, either.  The sets are garish, the special effects are cheesy, and the action scenes are dull and unrealistic, with Schumacher often directing them in a tilted angle for some unknown reason.The worst thing Schumacher did with the sets themselves is change Gotham City from a dark and grim society into some sort of flamboyant city. Gotham City simply doesn't look the same.  It looks, well, happy an cheerful. Plus, somehow, the whole city has gotten  some sort of odd purplish tint surrounding it, along with statues and designs, most of which are plain overkill, that were never there in the previous films. 
It may seem rather harsh of me to say that this could very well have been the worst theatrically-released film in the last 10 or so years, but it certainly has deserved this dubious distinction.  I can still see people regarding this movie with disdain years from now.The rumors have been surfacing that Darren Arronofsky is to direct the next installment, and while he would be a better choice than Schumacher (to be fair, the man has been showing improvement with Tigerland) this is a franchise that won't get its footing right if it doesn't regain the touch of Tim Burton or a lead performance equal to Keaton's.",Batman & Robin
271,adamsmith-51004,For a long time this was the death of Batman on the big screen,3,14 April 2021,"After Keaton and before Bale takes on the Iconic role, George Clooney has a awful take on the the caped crusader. To be fair he's not helped by the woeful script, poor direction which can't make its mind up if it want to play this campy, comic book or just farce. There is no dark Knight here. Nor any back story. Clooney just wanders around looking smug and rich. The integral premise that should be good of conflict between the bat and Robin is so weak. Silverstone is shockingly bad. The villains actually do alright within the script. Arnie gives a cheesy performance as Mr Freeze with plenty of bad puns worthy of Christmas cracker jokes. Less said about the dreadful Bane the better.Some of the scenes are so bad that you either want to laugh or cry bat nipples on the batsuit and Batman's credit card stand out.Avoid unless you really feel the need to cross off all the films.",Batman & Robin
272,voicemaster71,What could have been a real good movie resulted in an Abomination!!!,3,20 June 2005,"Yes. I am a DIE HARD Batman fan. Yes. I am a fan of both Batman and Robin. Yes. I am a fan of the old TV series and the Filmation cartoons. Yes. I am a fan of the SuperFriends. Am I a fan of this fourth Batman movie? HELL NO!!! Now there are some small parts of the movie that I love and it won't take long to get them out of the way. 1: The title. I always wanted to see a big screen movie called Batman and Robin, BUT I'd have rather it have been the title of the third Batfilm instead of a dorky title like Batman Forever. 2: The sky surfing scene and the music with it. 3: The conflict between Bruce and Dick, both in and out of costume 4: Chris O Donnell as Robin. He was the only great actor in that movie. And lest I forget, Robin's motorcycle, the Redbird. AND THAT IS IT!!!!Like I said in Batman Returns, the four Batman movies have a common link, where Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher did good on their first movies, but got too carried away with their visions in the second films. Now while I felt Tim Burton got too carried away with Batman Returns, his craziness is actually sane compared to how carried away Schumacher got with Batman and Robin. Burton's overboard ways are actually forgivable.1: Once again, Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. The problem now was a neon fluorescent look that went way overboard. And their attempt to copy Batman: The Animated Series and make it a retro city in its own time period fell flat on its face.2: Batman himself. Once again, just like his predecessor Val Kilmer, Batman was poorly miscast. However, while I could handle Kilmer's Batman scenes and not his Bruce Wayne scenes, the complete opposite happens here with George Clooney. I can't accept him in the Batman scenes, but I can believe his Bruce Wayne scenes since he looked more like Bruce than Val Kilmer did. But still, he was miscast. Schumacher said in an interview that it was time for Bruce to stop mourning over his parents' deaths and focus on teaching Dick and Barbara and care for the ailing Alfred. BS!!!! Batman is a grim figure and always will be. 3: Although Robin was the best thing in this movie, even the Teen Wonder has a problem that keeps the movie from being enjoyable. The costume! Why did they mess with costume?! For all intents and purposes, his costume and mask represent Nightwing. The only thing making him Robin is the cape. 4: Like Two Face before him, Mr. Freeze was funny! Arnold Schwartzeneggar portrayed him in a funny manner. I prefer the animated version of Freeze who is dead to emotions. 5: Poison Ivy. While I like Uma Thurman, I felt Uma went overboard with her campy portrayal of the plant lady and like the Riddler before her, her costumes got stranger and stranger as the movie progressed. 6: Batgirl: Now that was a Bat Abomination!!! As far as I'm concerned, Batgirl should have been Barbara Gordon, not Barabara Wilson, Alfred's niece. And I would have preferred a redhead in the role. Alicia Silverstone was miscast. I actually prefer Dina Meyer's Batgirl scenes in the short lived Birds of Prey series. 7: Bane: Totally useless. Doesn't talk and does not have the intelligence he has in the comics. He says limited words (BOMB!)and he acts like the Incredible Hulk!! This was proof that there were too many characters in this movie. 8: Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. I never could believe that this guy was Gordon. He looked more like Chief O Hara from the TV series when he was wearing a police uniform! What was up with that?!! 9: This movie had the absolute worst Batmobile in history. It was a one seater like the Kenner toys and it had no roof. It looked more like a racer than a car. The final battle Batsuits and vehicles were a sick, filthy joke!!! 10: No musical score album for this movie. The Eliot Goldenthal music was mostly recycled from Batman Forever. Danny Elfman was sorely missed. 11: When Batman and Robin leap around, they look more like they're flying like Superman. Was that really necessary?! I think not!!!Batman and Robin could have been a great movie, but Joel Schumacher really messed it up once and for all, sending the Batman franchise into a Diabetic Coma for a number of years until now. Batman Begins really kicks the living crap out of this movie. ""Batman and Robin"" has got to be one of the worst SuperHero movies ever alongside Superman IV. Just because I like certain things in this movie, doesn't mean I like the movie. This was the burial of the Batman franchise. No Batfilm. No Bat Theater.",Batman & Robin
273,kismit,Bring back Keaton and Burton before it's too late!,5,13 August 2001,"I watched 3 of the 4 Batman movies in the last week and I was amazed at how much better the first two were. Keaton is far and away the best of the 3 Batmen but in fairness to Clooney and Kilmer they did not have Tim Burton. Apparently his vision of Batman was ""too dark"" for action figure manufacturers but the movie going public didn't seem to mind. Compare the villains in the first two films with Jim Carey and Arnold. I actually did not have a problem with Arnold(he didn't write the punchless script)and Jim Carey was almost a natural for the Riddler but these characters did not have the well played origins that the Joker and the Penguin did. How about Uma?? Wasn't she awful? Again she didn't write the script but compare her character with the Catwoman character of Michelle Pfeiffer. It may be too late for this franchise but I would really like to see Burton bought back for the next one.",Batman & Robin
274,kismit,What on earth were you people expecting?,5,26 July 2004,"I agree this flick was the weakest of the series with 2/3 of the voters on this site rating the film below a 5.

If you are one of the people who rated this thing a 1 out of 10 then you are required to : 1) run from room immediately or 2) through an object at your TV should it ever come on the small screen.If you don't do one of the above then your vote was wasted. What does a 1 for this film mean about Gigli, White Chicks, Showgirls, Blair Witch 2, Battlefield Earth,The Avengers,The Sweetest Thing, Ballistic Ecks vs Sever, Grease 2, Shanghai Surprise, Ishtar, Wild Wild West, The Haunting, Idle Hands, Cabin Fever, or the remake of Rollerball? Voting a 1 here doesn't mean anything when there are a bunch of other movies out there that are so awful you want to punch out the person that sold you the ticket. Not saying we should all fatten up this turkey with 9s and 10s but a 1 really implies you haven't seen anything much worse, and I unfortunately can't say anything like that.",Batman & Robin
275,fathersonholygore,"For shame, Joel Schumacher! For shame.",2,2 May 2013,"As someone who considers himself a Batman fanatic, this film is a real terrible disappointment, and especially considering who is involved. George Clooney and Uma Thurman are two people I love to watch on film, so it's a shame they were involved in such a terrible interpretation of Batman. Worst part of it is that I think Clooney plays a wonderful Bruce Wayne persona; maybe not so much the Batman side, but he definitely nails Wayne's attitude the way I see it.The biggest problem with this is the cartoonish feel it has, but unlike Tim Burton's Batman & Batman Returns, it doesn't have much (if any) darkness to it. Part of the lure of Batman are his dark qualities, the torment of his parents death, and we get none of that here, only a neon Batman adventure. Sure, I love seeing Batman protect Gotham City, but even the fights here are uninspired, and just flashy sequences. For some reason it was like Schumacher set out to try and capture the spirit of the original Batman series, but it doesn't work (and I was never particularly a fan of Adam West and that series to be honest); I kept wondering if he would go right back to the Adam West Batman movie, and waited for some shark repellent, or other foolishness to appear. It's really a tragedy how Schumacher treats the Batman story here. He wanders between wanting to pay homage to the Adam West Batman, and keeping the dark aspects of the character, but it all falls into camp-mode. Let me say this, I am a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger in films like Terminator, the first Conan film, his appearance in the documentary Pumping Iron, Predator, Total Recall, and True Lies, but here he is just too cheesy. Schwarzenegger knows he is cheesy, as I remember recently reading an article where he feels his accent always provided some more hilarity, and many lines come off better if they're said foolishly, but in Batman it doesn't work. The Mr. Freeze character would work here if it was supposed to be a comedy, but Schumacher's confusion of where he wants to go with the film puts both Schwarzenegger and Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy out of context. The only villain who seemed to fit was Bane, and luckily they made him a speechless character.This film suffers from a severe identity crisis. I can give this movie a 3 out of 10 stars because I did like George Clooney as Bruce Wayne, and I also think Chris O'Donnell embodies characteristics of Robin that are true to the source, but other than that I am supremely disappointed with the film. I have seen every incarnation of Batman there has been so far, and this is certainly the worst. Even not enjoying the old Batman series, I can at least find parts of it that work, but here not much works to redeem it. The previous film, Batman Forever, was not as bad, yet it wasn't great either, and it must have only been due to monetary success at the box office that they let Schumacher take another whack at Batman. It's too bad they did. I could at least get behind Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as both the Riddler and Two Face Harvey Dent respectively. Batman & Robin only leaves a cruddy taste in my mouth.",Batman & Robin
276,Clothahump,What can I say?,10,27 December 2003,"I gave it a 10.Any movie that has Alicia Silverstone running around in tight spandex gets big numbers from me!  Granted, it wasn't too terribly long on plot, etc. and George Clooney has yet to see the day that he can act worth a durn, but man - that Batgirl just makes my heart go pittypat!",Batman & Robin
277,pcsarkar,Is it so bad? I think not,7,9 February 2012,"I do not think that films based on comic characters need to be taken very seriously, as though they were serious literature. Comics are for short-term entertainment, and so are films based on such comics. And if a film brings out a comic character successfully in cinematographic form, it may be considered an achievement. I review Batman & Robin in the context of earlier Batman movies and latter Dark Knight series. Here goes..I believe that Batman & Robin is a fast-paced entertainer, with groovy action, crisp, double-meaning dialog, bright comic costumes, sly innuendos and a 'feel-good' feeling at the end. Arnie excels as Mr Freeze, and so does Uma as Poison Ivy. The antics of these two, throughout the film, amply compensate for the film's weaknesses: Clooney is a boring Batman, and Alicia as Batgirl, is thoroughly annoying. Chris, as Robin, has the usual problems of teenagers, viz. rebellion to any form of authority, awakening sexuality and lack of experience in worldly matters. No big deal. However, compared to the dull and depressing Batman films of Keaton or Kilmer, or the literally 'dark' Batman films of Bale, this one is racy.. it does not take itself too seriously.. it does not explore hidden meanings, psychological problems or world domination. It is surfeit with bright, wacky, comic characters from the DC Universe, and its sole aim is to entertain. And entertain it does.",Batman & Robin
278,Xophianic,"Not completely bad, but not very good",5,25 August 1999,"I hope Tim Burton takes over the Batman movie series. If WB didn't learn their lesson after this one, they never will. Batman Forever I liked, but it foreshadowing this movie, which turned the once cool, dark, Batman-worthy Burton version into a glow-in-the-dark, kiddy-show, campy version. I still say this movie is OK, but if something isn't done about Joel, I won't be saying this for much longer.Here we go...Batman: I am so surprised that everyone says that George Clooney is the best part of this movie. He is the worst Batman in my opinion.(I think Kilmer was the best) Clooney isn't that bad, but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!Robin: Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker, minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately, the part is a whiny, annoying, untrustworthy, gullible, stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin, he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever, but his character isn't improving.Batgirl: You know, we really didn't need another sidekick right away, did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6, for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great (though not in this movie) but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.Mr. Freeze: Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold, and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah, his thing was ice, but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE (no exaggeration) had to be an ice pun!Poison Ivy: The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part, despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting, unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts, you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.Bane: I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling, stupid, grunt-like idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.Alfred: Alfred is just as good as always in this movie, although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.Commishoner Gordan: You know, in Batman you had respect for this guy. Now his only scenes are when he drools over Poison Ivy. Sad.Overall, Uma Thurman's sexy role in this movie alone is enough for you to watch this movie.

I didn't get into Batman until just a few years ago, starting out with the 80s movies, I was thoroughly impressed, until one day, something terrible happened...I decided it was time to watch the next instalment in the Batman film series, Batman and Robin, after the awesome action scenes and great direction of the previous Batman films, I was super excited, and this one had Arnold Schwarzenegger in it, great! Well, as it turned out, it was anything, but great!Batman and Robin is so ridiculously campy that I find it hard to take seriously no matter how I look at it, the writing is just pure trash, the direction is just awkward and unfocused, and the cast know this is a bad film, and nothing they can do will make it worse, so they just don't try.The plot kinda makes sense but character motivations really don't, a woman willing to sacrifice human life, for plants, um, no, and the Ice guy, yeah that's what I'm gonna call him because god forbid he have a character worthy of a proper name, tries to bring his wife back even after falling into super cold liquid and turning into an ice monster who can't live in temperatures that exceed 0 degrees, yeah that's gonna work, and a bit more of an explanation as to why that cold liquid turned him into ice man in the first place would've been nice.George Clooney is OK as the awesome as ever Batman, I just wish I could say the same for Chris O'Donnell as Robin. Robin is like a spoilt child in this film, every time Batman tries to save him from Poison Ivy's trap, he goes off on one claiming that Batman won't let him do anything by himself and that he doesn't trust him, yeah Robin, there's a reason.As for Alicia Silverstone as this Barbara, the supposed niece of Alfred the butler, well, her performance is very middle of the road, doing just enough not to make her awful, but not enough to make her memorable. Her character just spends ages wondering around or being rather mysterious before undramatically and rather easily becoming Batgirl, and begins helping out the other two as if she'd been doing this for years, when this is actually her first time as Batgirl. Need I say more?Batman and Robin isn't bad because it's less epic than the others, or because it's more jokey, it's because it's so campy and cheesy and the whole film feels like a kick in the face which will leave your head spinning from all the cheesy performances and crappy dialogue that this film contains. Nobody wanted it then, Nobody wants it now, and I think Batman and Robin will stay that way, Forever!",Batman & Robin
280,ryanskywalker-87402,"""what almost killed the batman franchise? Joel schumacher!""",2,6 March 2017,"It's hard to contemplate what more can really be said about the titanic mess that is Batman & Robin that hasn't already been essayed and documented in the last seventeen years (good lord has it been that long?!). When it comes to placing blame, should we really level it at Joel Schumacher or should we not look deeper at ourselves? Because we only have ourselves to blame. Batman Forever made triple its budget and brainwashed a great many people into believing that's how Batman movies should be delivered, so can you blame Schumacher for xeroxing a formula that seemingly worked, certainly from a FINANCIAL standpoint? In recent years Schumacher--unfairly maligned as a hack based on this when he's made more than one fine movie--has vocally agreed with the scorn levelled upon this movie and subsequently it's hard to punish him too greatly. Make no mistake, however, Batman & Robin--unless fate plays a desperately cruel trick--will be the worst Batman, and possibly superhero, movie ever committed to celluloid. It truly is as horrendous as you've always been told.We're a million miles away from the Burton movies now, and infinite light years from the graphic novels of the 1980's that explored the dark tragedy of the Dark Knight, and into pure camp, pantomime comedy right from the ludicrous opening set piece in Gotham History Museum - a brace of overblown colour that infects the entire picture meshed with possibly the worst script Hollywood has ever produced at such an expensive, high level. Akiva Goldsman again has been pilloried greatly for this monstrosity, and again we're dealing with a talent who *can* deliver in other circumstances--indeed like Schumacher--but like almost everything in this picture, his script and story alongside direction pitches every last thing completely wrong. At least Forever attempted to try and blend a fresher, lighter approach with a hint of the Gothic darkness inherent in the previous movies, Batman & Robin is like watching a live-action toy commercial for two hours directed by a hyperactive child who has gone slightly bonkers with their Crayola. The script, meanwhile, just... words fail to express just how badly judged almost every line, every word, every pun truly is. You genuinely have to wonder if this was all intentional because it's hard to imagine how anyone could write this without intending on spoof.Much has been made about the performances here too over the years and the advent of YouTube has perhaps led to a slight revision here. I mean, come on, how can you not enjoy Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze? Right from the get go, his every line is a terrifyingly bad pun that when you see edited together on social media, with Arnie's unique delivery, is pure comic GOLD - unintentional as it may be. Arnie has made a fair few comedies in his career but, honestly, he's never been funnier than in this. Of course alongside that we sadly have to suffer even more Chris O'Donnell given he gets joint billing - his Robin even more of an annoying, whiney little bitch than before. Equally frustrating is Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy - and though she may look deliciously seductive, she chews on dialogue in the same stilted manner as her misjudged turn in The Avengers, hamming up yet failing to match Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman for seductive allure. The most amazing thing about the cast here though, without doubt, is that George Clooney's career managed to survive his stint as Batman/Bruce Wayne here. It's almost impossible to dislike Clooney, and you mainly feel sorry for him here, but the fact he got away with this is a Houdini-level trick many movie stars could never pull off.Maybe we all got this film wrong, you know? Maybe Batman & Robin is supposed to be this camp, this OTT, this silly, this gaudy, this ridiculous, this cheesy, this childish, this abysmally cringeworthy, and maybe we've all been missing the point for the last two decades almost. Maybe this was trying to be a new age version of the 60's daftness many of us grew up watching, loving and imitating. Or, maybe, and perhaps more likely, perhaps Batman & Robin is an example of what can happen when too many people with too much money and not enough common sense are allowed to take one of the greatest heroes in pulp literature and try and make millions of dollars. In other words, Joel Schumacher didn't make a movie, he made a two hour warning that should remind us of one thing... that we can *never* let anything like this happen again.",Batman & Robin
281,Tresix,Don't let it end on THIS note!!,4,15 June 1999,"Hard to believe that Joel Schumacher, who made the best Batman movie, would follow it up with the near worst (nothing can top (or is it bottom?) the serials from the '40s).  The banter between Batman and Robin seemed almost like they were sniping at each other.  George Clooney registers zero mystery as Batman and even less sex appeal as Bruce Wayne.  I had a hard time understanding Arnold Schwarzenegger between his accent and that thing they had over his mouth.  Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy did way too much vamping as if she were channeling the ghost of Mae West.  Bane, a brute in the comic books, but an intelligent one, is reduced to merely grunting and growling here.  Given the personalities of characters that she usually plays, Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl nearly blends into the background.  I think it might have benefitted if Thurman and Silverstone switched roles. Hopefully, this isn't the way that they're going to end the franchise. Just as I hope that SUPERMAN IV:  THE QUEST FOR PEACE isn't the way they end that one.  All the future filmmakers have to do is remember the rich comic book history of the character.",Batman & Robin

You really have to see it to understand just how awful it is as words can't describe this fantastically pathetic film. What in the world happened to Tim Burton's dark vision????? It was replaced by Ernest Goes to Gotham City!!! The plot is moronic, the one-liners must have been written by a 5-year old, and the action makes The Three Stooges look like Barishnikov. The acting is also beneath contempt, who in their right minds can ever believe again that Alicia Silverstone can act??? (Ok, did anyone actually believe it in the first place?) Right from the outset, the director does not pull any punches. He firmly establishes that this movie will be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, that it will be the Mel Brooks of superhero movies. From the ridiculous stunts, poor camera work, terrible CGI, there is nothing good about this film! Even the Batmobile looked like a Tonka toy! It now has a disco ball for an engine!?!!

283,DJ_Shilo,Batface & Roadkill,1,18 June 2020,"I had some ambition for ""Batman & Robin"" when I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, but I was shocked at the performances. George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell do not work, and my ambition quickly dwindled after the opening sequence to a look of shock, but I will get to that. I feel like I just watched a commercial to sell Toys. Whatever Joel Schumacher was thinking, he will have some explaining to do. This third sequel to the Batman series is one of the worst films ever made from beginning to end.It's about Bruce Wayne/Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) who attempt to save Gotham City from two new villains, Mr. Freeze (Arnold) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) who plan to freeze the city and then turn Gotham into a Greenhouse.Tim Burton set up an exciting world for Gotham City with the original ""Batman"" back in 1989. It was gritty, visually stunning and set the mood. ""Batman Returns"" was much darker with a more violent tone but was gorgeous to look at with the winter setting. ""Batman Forever"" didn't do much except give us two over the top villains and Val Kilmer as Batman, who was not terrible. So what went wrong with this film? I don't know, but If I had to guess, I would say studio interference. The only thing good about it is again, the stunning look of Gotham. The rest is terrible, and I question why Joel Schumacher signed on with the screenplay being as bad as it is. It's too big of a budget to be a cash grab, but trying to figure out the reason will lead to a headache and not worth it.So about that opening sequence, I mentioned earlier. It opens with Batman & Robin putting their atomically correct suits on that feature Bat and Robin Nipples along with rubberized man ass with jacked up cheeks when they turn, and the camera zooms in and holds on said asses. Aside from that awkwardness, the opening dialogue tells you what you are about to watch. Robin admires the Batmobile, and he says, ""I want a car. Chicks dig the car."" And Batman says, ""This is why Superman works alone."" Robin climbs on his bike and says to Alfred, ""Don't wait up, Al,"" and Alfred says with his British accent, ""I'll cancel the Pizzas."" Alfred appears looking very sick, and instead of becoming essential to the story, they make him a subplot when we find out what is wrong with him. They focus all the effort on the toyetic approach and the other characters. There was an excellent idea for a story with Alfred that could have resulted in a better movie, but the screenwriters weren't smart enough to figure that out.Mr. Freeze shows up at the Gotham Museum, and he looks like an action figure. Mr. Freeze is an over the top version of Arnold himself complete with one-liners that are the source of humour for the movie. The Implausible has to happen with the heroes, so the pair end up on a giant rocket piloted by Freeze that sends them halfway up into space without freezing to death. Eventually, they kick the side doors of the rocket into surfboards and fly through the sky.Poison ivy is next, and her story is garbage. Uma Thurman is awful as Ivy in the movie and the worst thing about it. She is a scientist of some sort; I think a botanist and she is unhinged. Her boss eventually turns her into Ivy. She plays Batman, and Robin like an over the top sex kitten with venomous lips and her whole plan is to bury Gotham in plants. There is no point for her to be in the film or her mask-wearing henchman, Bane (Jeep Swenson), who is simply her muscle and a big dumb beast.At one point in the film, we find out Mr. Freeze's back story, and it is heartfelt when you see another see of him. I will never get Arnold out of my head singing, ""I'm Mr. White Christmas"" to his thugs and saying ""Sing, louder. Come on, Sing, Sing."" He tries to make them sing, but they are all frozen because his hideout is an icebox. Anyway, you can tell that Freeze is not the villain of the film, and Ivy is. If they had of left her out, made Freeze the villain and brought it together with Alfred's subplot being the main storyline, this would have been a much better film. It's a very character-driven movie, but one character doesn't belong, and I won't waste time, it is Batgirl. Alicia Silverstone appears in the film as Alfred's niece Barbara. She shows up in the third act as Batgirl, and her first words are, ""You're about to become compost"" to Ivy before she fights her.George Clooney is not very good as Batman and why he got cast, is a mystery. I think this movie may have started as something different, and the studio got involved, and this is the movie we ended up getting. The dialogue sounds fed through a blender to the stupidity of useless characters that come across as cartoonish for a big-budget film. Speaking of big-budget, when Batman is unthawing the city with a giant telescope, he built it in the first place just for a villain to end up using it, how convenient! Anyway, a cop car unthaws, and when the cop kicks the door open, the icicles on the door wobble as if they were rubber tree branches glues on. Where did the money go?I was surprised by the ending. It's pretty bad with the trio trying to stop Freeze, and sparks flying everywhere. However, there is another heartfelt moment between Freeze and Batman in the final moments that again shows the human side to this character. Alfred is very sick with something that Freeze was attempting to find a cure for, and it made me want no, Robin, no Batgirl and no Ivy. Just Alfred, Freeze and Batman, but unfortunately, we got this movie instead. We may or may not get an answer as to what went wrong here, but it doesn't matter because this is wasted money for an unbelievably lousy film that you can't take seriously and should be avoided this summer. Even to see just how bad it is, it's not worth your money.

When you compare this movie to any of the other three Bat-movies that came before it, there's no contest. This movie sucks. REALLY sucks. It's an insult to the franchise. From bad one-liners to atrocious acting, this even made me ashamed, and I didn't even work on the movie! There are a slew of things wrong with this movie:No chemistry between Bruce Wayne and whoever that girl is who he was dating (wait a second, there was ROMANCE in this movie???); turning Gotham City into art-nouveau central; Coolio; building elaborate things in the Batcave that has no practical use (I mean, come on: STROBE LIGHTS???); the Bat-credit card (speaks for itself); Bat-nipples (also speaks for itself); Arnold Schwartzenegger (can't believe I spelled that correctly) camping it up; having a Batgirl who's kind of chubby; Uma Thurman (who really knows better than this); ridiculous scientific explanations for solving problems (called ""Deus Ex Machina"")I could go on, but it would be pointless.Bottom Line: Wait a second, there's a bottom line?

286,Yonhap S,"very bad, but have fun doing MST3000 on it",4,18 October 1999,"Everyone knows this movie is terrible.  The only consolation we can have watching this movie is making fun of it.  It's so inane and silly that you must ask yourself ""what were they thinking?""That's what I did for my third viewing.  It saves the pain of seeing Batman and Robin in public at a charity ball.  Many fans must have hated that scene for it's a complete throwback to the 60's.  Something no longer appropriate after being exposed to stories by Frank Miller or Tim Burton's darker version of Batman.  Another annoyance is the architecture of Gotham.  It doesn't make sense.  We get tall buildings, extremely tall statues, bridges that lead nowhere.  Watching it, somehow the movie loses all sorts of perspective.  Imagine the chase scene where the Freezemobile, Batmobile, and Redbird were travelling on the arm of a really big statue.  The Redbird is only about the size of the statue's fingertip.  That would have to be one really big statue.  The bridges' height also drives me crazy.  This is not quite the same Gotham of Batman Forever (let alone Batman 1989).I don't ever remember Mr. Freeze requiring diamonds to power his suit or his freeze gun.  Therefore, the writer only used diamonds simply because they look like ice.  Elle McPherson's role as Julie Madison is wasted as she adds nothing to the story, just an obligatory love interest.  There's one scene where after Batman being blown with pheromones by Poison Ivy, he says Ivy's name while on a romantic night with Elle.  It goes like this:Julie: ""Ivy?  Who's Ivy?""Bruce: ""I wish I knew.""Ooh.  Try having that conversation with your girlfriend or wife!Finally, the network of satellites to be used for the Gotham observatory. You could actually just do with 1 or 2 and just electronically transmit images from space.  And then share the view via a big TV.  That would be less expensive.  Half of this film's budget must have been spent acquiring the actors' services alone.On the plus side, I liked the Batgirl/Poison Ivy fight scene.  The only thing wrong with it is that Poison Ivy isn't much of a martial artist. Arnold was the only other good thing in the movie.  He played Mr. Freeze well, just that his performance is marred by a horrible script.The verdict: 2 of 5 stars.",Batman & Robin
287,FilmFreak94,God Help Us All,2,15 August 2012,"After Batman Forever was a financial success it seemed only logical for Joel Schumacher to direct a sequel. Yeah why not? Sure Forever had a campy attitude and the visuals had more personality than some of the characters but it wasn't terrible. So we probably can't expect much going into this but it's got Mr. Freeze and he's a good villain. So are Poison Ivy and Bane they're all pretty good. Yeah this movie might actually be... oh dear Lord.All right enough beating around the bush, Batman and Robin is a pitiful excuse of a superhero movie, even a movie in general. The characters are campy cardboard cut outs of their comic counterparts, the visuals are even more forced than the last movie to the point where they become ridiculous and the dialogue is about as cheesy as a Saturday morning cartoon PSA. Well the main plot is that Mr. Freeze('brilliantly' cast as Arnold Schwarzenegger) is trying to make a giant ice laser to hold Gotham ransom so he can get enough money to find the cure for his wife Nora whom he has kept in a cryogenic container. While this is going on, a scientist named Pamela Isley has discovered her associate has been using plants to experiment on a new drug called Venom which he uses to create Bane. The scientist kills her but the chemicals fuse into her body and she becomes Poison Ivy. She and Bane go to Gotham and eventually help Mr. Freeze with his plans to secretly work on her own schemes. On top of that, Alfred's niece Barbara has come to Gotham and Alfred is sick with the same disease Freeze's wife has. Robin is feeling put down by Batman and wants to be more independent and Barbara soon dons the cape and cowl of Batgirl to help them take down Freeze and them. And this is the first problem the movie has. There's too much plot. How are we supposed to keep track and care about everything if there's too much going on in one movie? That's really the problem when more than two villains are in the mix. Batman Returns and Batman Forever had a similar problem but this one is much worse. Even the Alfred subplot which should be really emotional gets lost in the mix of all this mess they call the main story.On top of that the characters in this movie are just wrong. Batman has little to no personality in the film, Robin acts like a brat, and Barbara does little to nothing to add any emotional value to the whole ""Alfred's dying"" thing. I have to give credit to Michael Gough and Pat Hingle as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon respectively. They've been doing this for four movies and at least know how their characters should work in the franchise. And the villains. What a joke. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is about as good a match as water to electricity. All he does is spout one- liners and puns relating to ice. In the comics and the animated series the interpretation of the character draws from, he's a sympathetic villain who wasn't above making a pun but didn't do it every five minutes he was on camera. Uma Thurman isn't terrible or bad looking but she wasn't a good fit for Poison Ivy. When I imagine Ivy I imagine a bombshell stereotypical model who uses her looks to get what she wants but is also competent and a deadly threat. Here she isn't that attractive to me and all her evil plan consists of in the long run is to kill everyone with a kiss. And don't even get me started on Bane. This is the guy who organized a mass breakout and broke the Batman's back? All he does in this movie is make guttural sounds and repeat whatever word was just said to him. He's pathetic and it makes you wonder why they even included him if they were gonna stray so far from what made his character so great in the comics.The visuals are somewhat appealing but the bright neon blue, green and red are even more gaudy than the last movie and almost made me want to hurl. Overall this movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. But I'm giving it two stars out of ten because I watch it whenever it's on TV and always get some laughs out of it. I guess that could classify it as a guilty pleasure but honestly, as a Batman film it's horrible, as a film in general... what were they thinking?",Batman & Robin
288,RJBose,Dismal and disjointed- don't waste the 3 bucks.,1,8 January 1999,"George Clooney is wooden, Uma Thurman tries hard, and Arnold tries very hard, but nothing could save this disjointed and dismal waste of time.  The characters of ""Poison Ivy"" and ""Mr. Freeze"" are hastily introduced, as is a dull sub-plot about Alfred's failing health.  When in an early scene a battle with Freeze's thugs turns into an ""ice-capades"" event (Batman and Robin's boots, when clicked together produce skate blades), I knew it would be a lost cause. Alicia Silverstone appears, but no real explanation is given for her athletic abilities and stamina (aside from a mention of karate classes and an interest in motorcycles).  She's cute, but even that is not enough to rescue the movie from the inane, boring and predictable subplots of tension between the Caped Crusaders over ""trust"" and Alfred's ostensibly impending death. Only a real fan could get any enjoyment or interest from this sad collection of lame jokes, exhausted fight scenes and banal villany.  A real fan would have already seen this in the theater too, and wouldn't be reading this anyway.",Batman & Robin

All I can say is 'Why?' The thing that makes me sad is that this could have been the best hit of the summer. It wasn't. I have found a lot of things that should've been put in the movie. What ever happened to Michael Keaton? The cast was huge but could they perform the characters of this franchise? NO WAY! The acting just plain sucked. Another thing, the script. Every time I hear a quote from this movie, I just feel like it's from an Alan Smithee film. The last weak part of this is when they get hit and do flips, you can tell they are on wires. Oh yeah, the Batmobile has never looked worse. The technical works in this were really good. That's the upside of this movie. Other than that this movie does ok. It's the campy feeling that makes this something to pass up. I am just so disappointed that it wasn't better.

290,Skeletors_Hood,Holy Guano Batman!,5,26 October 2001,"Leaves you cold, doesn't it.  That empty, hollow feeling knowing that the Batman character has been slaughtered to death and back by so many bad elements that it boggles the mind. So many things went wrong here.Now, to be fair, the movie looked good in its presentation.  The previews gave us a glimpse of a colorful spectacle that the movie was going to deliver.  The lights dim.  Everyone hushes.  The presentation is good. Then the script kicks in, and you feel queasy.  The acting begins, and you feel a churning sensation.  Then Clooney delivers a line, and it's straight to the toilet to heave the popcorn!I HATE walk-through actors!  With a passion!!  Casting Clooney was a travesty and disaster to the character of Batman on so many levels!  What a sad disgrace!  Clooney had no business here!  He walked through it, ignoring the fact that he's an actor (though you would never really notice it). The movie dragged when he was on screen, either as Batman or Bruce Wayne, slowing down the pace.  The only reason that he was cast was so that the female populace who dedicate their lives to that ""ER"" crap would get off the couch and shell out some money to see Clooney's butt covered in a layer of rubber.  Eye candy! Blargh!Uma Thurman was also a thorn in the side of the movie!  She can't pull herself as an actor any more than Clooney can!  Now, she did a better job in this movie than Clooney (heck, a brain-dead monkey would have done a better job than Clooney, let's be honest).  She of course is just eye candy for the fan-boys out there.  A true hack!  She made Poison Ivy too spoiled-little-bratish for my liking, and I don't see any chemistry between her and the other actors on the film.  She could have been left out, and no one would have noticed.Bane....oh how painful!  To see the greatest Bat-villain of all...reduced to a faceless henchman, mindless and dumb ( maybe the writer wanted the part for himself).  Bane was never that way!  I understand when a screenwriter molds a character from one medium to another, some changes are inevitable. But to make a character the complete opposite of what he was to begin with is going to far.  It's the same as writing that Batman is rain man or something.  The actor was probably glad to be wearing a mask, just to hide his shame.And, uh....Batgirl.  Hmmmm.  Why was she here?  And by the way, written in as no relation to Gordon.  Riiiiight!  Here as eye candy only?  Uh huh! and let's make the move of hiring someone who can't act (wait, w have Clooney here, and Thurman too.  Hmm, must be going for a record).And while we're at it, let's ""Get Smart"" sa well.  The scene with Robin and his rubber lips were a direct throwback to the Don Adams show from the 60's. I guess the writers wanted as many 60's references as possible.  Now, to be fair, I think Chris O'Donnell did a great job reprising his role as Robin. The script DID accomplish one thing, by showing the tension that escalated between Bruce and Dick from the comic book, later resulting in Dick leaving to become his own person.  Hats off to Chris here...the poor guy just didn't have much to work with.Another redeeming feature the film has is Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze.  Yes, there were bad, bad puns involved, but they weren't distracting at all.  AND Arnold didn't walk trough the film.  He did his job...ACTING!  He was consistent with his role, and his outfit looked cool. Plus, I liked him here, not just because I'm an Arnold fan, but when I watch a movie, I enjoy it when it becomes apparent to me that an actor is having a good time.  Look at Arnold when you watch this, and you can tell he's having a blast!  And because he was having fun, I had fun watching him.
This last installment of the franchise failed to deliver on many levels. With a strong stomach, one can tolerate it.  Very low in comparison with its predecessors.  An unfortunate accident of bad directing, bad writing, and bad acting will do that to a movie.",Batman & Robin
291,MinorityReporter,How to make the worst movie EVER! In 10 easy steps.,1,20 September 2007,"1. Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as a scientist and have him spout nothing but one-liners for the entire movie. I cannot stress how bad his performance is. Even by his standards the level of acting is shockingly poor. Also Mr. Freeze was an intelligent guy in the comics then it doesn't do to cast a guy who can't even speak American without a heavy accent. Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect (he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ) he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I, a great fan of the comics, did not find this amusing at all.3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies (which made them successful) and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal, which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor, poor, poor.5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl (Batgirl). She cannot pull it off.8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.In my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created.

Poison Ivy is awfully terrible, poor Uma Thurman, Bane is awfully terrible, Mr. Freeze is awfully terrible, Batgirl is awfully terrible, the whole film the awfully terrible.

Why am I telling you this?? Because that is the point in time everybody said the 90s franchise went sour. Next time you watch this movie listen to the dialog that Jim Carrey shares with Tommy Lee. It's actually funny and witty at the same time. The idea of Jim being in tights just adds to the effect of how crazy the Riddler is. To me he's just the opposite of the character of the Joker. Different kind of humor and everything. Out of the four films, this one has some of the best lines that I like to quote.Batman and Robin on the other hand to me only has one draw back - Cloony.

Do you really think it is that bad?  It's the comic book people who sound off on this movie because Batman aint as dark as he appears in the comic book or the first couple of movies.  Actually it was the darkness that I disliked about the first couple of movies.  You got people bashing Robin.  They don't want him in this movie.  When Robin was introduced in the third movie, I said about time. Enough of this dark stuff.  It's time to lighten this sucker up.As for the casting.  I liked it better than any of the others - although Nicholson as the Joker was pretty good and Pfeiffer as Catwoman was good.  I guess the casting of the villians has always been pretty good except for the Penguin.  And even there it wasn't Devito's fault.  I personally can't understand anyone who doesn't like Arnold as Mr Freeze.  To me he was wonderful in that role.  I am also not the biggest George Cooney fan but he was the best of the Batmans from this series.  The other casting in this movie was good too.  I read someone say how could Batman and Robin be fighting for Uma Thurman.  Are you watching the movie???  She is able to put a spell on them.  Before this movie I didn't even know who Poison Ivy was and I liked her character.  The only drawback character was Batgirl.I will repeat it again.  I loved this movie.  It was better than the first three Batmans.  My only gripe (besides Batgirl) is that these (all four) Batman movies spend too much time introducing new characters.

Now there may be more films out there that are worst than Batman and Robin but Batman and Robin was made for a lot of cash and was expected to be a lot more, especially after following the footsteps of the previous Batman films. Joel Schumacher almost ruined the franchise had it not been for the recent Batman Begins directed by Christopher Nolan. The fact that there was green fire everywhere and the buildings were designed to look like huge people was disgusting. In fact, Gotham City is supposed to be dark yet it was very colorful.George Clooney was horrible as Batman. It is not that he was bad, it's that he didn't change his personality from Batman to Bruce Wayne. Arnold was also horrible though some could be blamed by the horrible writing. Bane was useless and if they would have continued the franchise under the same direction, Bane could never be used again and that would be our lasting memory. Silverstone was also bad...just Bad, no other word to describe it. Best actor in the movie was Chris O'Donnell and that is sad but at least he had some emotion.Bad moments in film...Batman Credit Card...Suit Me Up Uncle Alfred...Silverstone puts in England as a password...Poison Ivoy falls into a large plant and that is how she is captured yet it is the same large plant that she made her entrance in the scene...Mr Freeze just happens to have the cure in his suit...This film is just horrible, Schumacher should be ousted from the Directors Guild.",Batman & Robin

From the beginning of the franchise we don't get Batman we get ""Bat-WUSS"" who looks like Bane should have hammered him into the ground with the first punch (of course Bane wasn't the extremely intelligent and not-so-slow fighter we know could do that that with the first three actors).So a backhanded complement to the Grandfather of the first true-blue Batman movie ever!

You could see that subtle change in all the previous titles, the change from dark, beautiful, freaky even to the neon-lights, pop and completely mainstream. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing to be pop, but sometimes some things are meant to be dark. The very essence of Batman character and his world is dark, so making so hip and colorful was not a good idea. But that's debatable, feel free to disagree. And while Batman Forever still had some flair to the poppy feel, this part doesn't.The truly terrible thing is the cast. Clooney is possibly the worst Batman ever; Silverstone hasn't still recovered from Clueless and she's convinced, I'm sure, that she's still playing that part (and she's doing it cluelessly); Thurman is good, but she and her skills don't fit here. Schwarzenegger is the one that's making the movie truly dreadful, though. Calling him an actor would be an overstatement. It takes a certain skill to be playing a villain; Schwarzenegger is lacking that skill, and many others. He makes the movie unwatchable. Paying him 25 millions dollars for that role is the sole definition of 'wasted money'.And then there's the terrible script that really makes no sense at all. It's forgettable.

The worst Bruce Wayne of any of the recent films. I'm not a Clooney fan, but nevertheless, his portrayal just did not click. Give Me Keaton, Bale, or Kilmer any day! 2) The bickering. The worst part of the film. Batman and Robin fighting among themselves, and that's before Ivy does her trick to Robin! Very irritating.3) Batgirl. Unneeded. Sure, she does well with computers. But unlike the Nicole Kidman character from the prior installment, Batgirl and her alter ego have little to do.4) Humor. Way too much. Arnold's is okay....hey he had humor in some of Terminator 2 and that was acceptable. But when Ivy starts with her twisted humor, it got a little too much.5) Bane. Originally I wrote (and have now re-edited) that he was an interesting character in the movie, but actually taking this dangerous criminal from the comics and relegating him to a stupid muscle man thug wasn't the wisest choice. I'm also spoiled by the Bane from The Dark Knight Rises.6) Poison Ivy - oh so irritating. Also in my original write-up, she was on the positive side. But after watching the film a few times...okay, she looked good, but the writers made her irritating with her personality. I wasn't ever thinking she was one of the better villains of this four-film series anyway.So despite the negativity, I find this film still worthy to my library.

I had found Batman Forever very enjoyable purely because it moved very fast, had plenty of action and over the top performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. The change of the city's look and atmosphere didn't bother me so much then. In this film it did. The city is now like some sort of circus full of goths, criminals and every other kind of strange social group you could think of.Anyway the real problem with this movie is the script. The previous 3 films at least had a script which wasn't too stupid and actually had a decent plot involved. This one features a preposterous plot with loads and loads of one-liners that are so bad they're good. Most of these are spoken by Mr Freeze.On the subject of performances, it seemed to be a common theme for all the performances as villains in Batman films to go over the top. How can anyone forget Nicholson, Devito, Pfiefer, Jones and Carrey? Its no exception here, but at least the previous films had better scripts.Here the cast try hard to make the material work. The best performance by far comes from Arnold Schwarzenegger, in what is only his second role as a villain I can think after The Terminator. Surprisingly, he looks to be having the time of his life as Mr Freeze and enjoying delivering the constant silly one-liners (and believe me there are lots). He also has some good moments grieving other his ill wife. Otherwise Clooney isun't that bad as Batman although when he said ""Hi Freeze I'm Batman!"" I couldn't help but chuckle. Then again thats the scripts fault, not his. Still, he's as good as Keaton or Kilmer. O'Donnell does become very annoying as the film progresses, but again its due to the lines he's given. He still does best. Thurman looks stunning as Poison Ivy, but like is given even worse one-liners than Arnold and her motives are ridicuolous. She also can't fight and has to rely on the worst character in the film- a bizarre supersoldier called Bane. Its for this reason she is a really poor villain and would never have considered her a threat like the ones from previous films. At least Catwoman actually put up a good fight! Silverstone, again trys but doesn't get anywhere thanks to the script.In fact the only good thing about the script is that it gives Michael Gough more screen time by providing a nice subplot about his health. HOugh is, as he was in the other films, wonderful as Alfred and he does have some good lines here. The best scene in the film for me is the most emotional one. Its near the end when Clooney thinks he's going to lose him and tells him he loves him.Otherwise, the film lacks any real action except the opening 20 minutes and the scene at an auction. Its mostly just the villains planning their scheme and joking around and Batman and Robin arguing.The best Batman films are of course Burtons and Nolans new version. Batman Forever is good as entertainment, but not about exploring the character. Here, it gets worse, but amazingly this film entertains me for its pure stupidness and every once in a while I can watch it for that.3/10",Batman & Robin
303,rorymacveigh,I think Joel Schumacher was deliberately trying to destroy Batman,1,18 July 2012,"Personally, I have never been a real fan of the Dark Warrior of Justice simply known as Batman, but I do know a bad movie when I see one. I've seen all of the Batman movies and I do think there is a lot of cheesiness to all of them, but this one really does take the biscuit in terms of useless one liners, terrible acting, pointless stunts, special effects I'd expect to find on a 1985 arcade game and just generally a story that is to complicated for people to understand logically.My experiences of the Batman franchise have been a rather declining one. The first Batman movie I liked because it really was dark, and that's what made it brilliant. It was serious, it was sinister, the villain was absolutely fantastic, and even the Bat himself was better than the rest, concealing himself from the limelight as the dark vigilante of Justice who roamed the streets in the fight for both truth and vengeance. This rubbed off in Batman Returns, but this one I think was a little too dark, with the ending not as satisfyingly happy or victorious as its predecessor.Then things started to fall apart when the franchise called for a change of directors, and this ship was launched with Batman Forever. Although a more light-hearted Batman film with Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones being enjoyably over the top bad guys, the dark premiss of the Batman continued on, even though the one liners from hell were starting to seep in at this point. And then, you have this, the worst and thankfully final instalment of the Batman franchise in the 1990s, and one that nearly killed it off forever.Now admittedly, I used to enjoy this film as a kid, it had a menacing looking bad guy, it had a lot of fighting, a lot of stunts and a lot of explosions (cos kids always love explosions, we're kind of morose that way), but as I grew up I realised that this film not only over the top, it was just plain goofy. It was almost like it was a spin-off film satirising Batman rather than actually trying to be a serious Batman film.The acting is an absolute joke, with Arnie giving more one liners than he should be prescribed to, George Clooney trying and failing miserably to be a Batman we could remember, Robin's actor (who I couldn't even be bothered to look up he was that annoying) is just a whining brat who constantly wants to get his own way about things even though he knows full well he can't, and Urma Thurman as Poison Ivy is crass.The very premiss of Batman's dark character in this movie has given way to a demand to be in the spotlight, a use of gadgets that would only be found in an early James Bond Movie and the fight scenes, which used to be very tense, long drawn out and usually had a payoff that was worth waiting for ended up looking like the fight scenes from the Adam West TV series.Overall, this film is just a lame, lame, LAME, attempt at trying to capture the true essence of Batman and as mentioned, I do actually believe that Joel Schumacher went out of his way to try and destroy this franchise, which thankfully made a comeback with the epicness that is the Dark Knight, a much better film...",Batman & Robin
304,dayton-w-price,A guilty pleasure.,7,28 December 2020,"I loved it as a kid, because I didn't know any better and years of nostalgia has keep it close to me. I'm not saying it's a good movie by any means, but the bright colors and characters cheesiness is what I loved about it, and never got Joel Schumacher fascination with bat nipples, but I digress. It has always been a guilty pleasure for just like Batman Forever is, and I think i always will.",Batman & Robin

Every time I watch this movie I laugh. This movie has great action and humor. I thought George Clooney was good as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Chris O' Donnel does a good job as Robin, Alicia Silverstone does a good job as Batgirl, Uma Thurman does a good job as Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job as Mr. Freeze. This movie has great cinematography, sets, acting, action and humor. This movie is a ride to watch. I thought this movie was better than Batman Forever.

306,FlikJedi719,Worst Batman movie of all time,1,3 January 2020,"Holy Cannoli is this movie bad... And the puns are even worse. The ice puns from Mr. Freeze are especially bad. Who was the casting director for this movie, and why did he/she think Arnold was a good choice for Mr. Freeze?After 12 years though the movie has become a running joke, and is somewhat enjoyable if you're in the mood for a laugh - but that is not a good thing. This film is clearly not to be taken seriously, and it almost feels as if the writers and Schumacher recognized it as such.Final grade: A no surprise 1/10",Batman & Robin

No. You can't even comprehend until you've seen this drivel first hand. You should see this movie just because it's so bad. This is one of the biggest ""What were they thinking""'s in movie history. Not only did it bury the once lucrative Bat franchise, it bears no resemblance to the 1989 film that started the ball rolling. Instead of utilizing the strengths Batman Forever had, they instead embelished everything that was wrong with that film. This has no place in reality. It's a great big, dumb cartoon and a total insult to Batman fans. Not to mention, they totally DESTROYED the character of Bane who was worthy of his own film. The acting, the casting choices, the costumes... EVERYTHING is wrong with this movie. But don't take my word for it. See it yourself and marinate in the crap that is Batman & Robin.",Batman & Robin

He is my favourite Batman ever.This movie is the most realistic of the series. I am liking the way the ice man is squirting his weapon over everyone. Very amusing. N plus ice = nice.He is squirting it at Batman And Robert. They must escape. Tension! N plus ice = nice.Joel Burton is a very nice director and his vision is an impressive one.Uma Thermal is very nice as Poison Dwarf and so is Alicia Silverback as the Boy Wonder's girlfriend, Catgirl.

Batman and Roger must fight the Man Of Ice very urgently. I am liking this! N plus ice = nice.Also, lots of plants are threatening to eat the citizens and a gang of underground maniacs join forces with Poison Dwarf to encourage the plants. Spooky. Nice! This is the best incarnation for Batman and is a vast improvement over Tim Schumachers original with Jack Nickelsun. I am sorry, I am spelling wrong, Jack Nicksenson. I apologise for my spelling.

309,DragonMasterHiro,"Oh my god, what a disaster.",1,26 June 2003,"Poor, poor Batman.  I hope none of the people who worked on this film were proud of it because it is awful. Again we get the weirdo trippy neon lighting instead of dark, mysterious atmosphere Gotham City. George Clooney is a lame Batman, the only reason they cast him was because of his popularity at the time.  I can see the casting directors sitting in the conference room saying, ""Ladies like Clooney. Ladies like movies.  Ladies like heroes.  Batman is a hero.  Let's make Clooney the new Batman.  We'll make millions.""  They made out stomachs turn instead.  Chris O'Donnell doesn't do anything fantastic either. Same whiney ""I'm gonna be a rebel"" Robin.  In my opinion, they shouldn't have introduced Robin in Batman Forever.  They have enough trouble with Batman and villains already. They didn't need another character to mess up.While I like Arnold for his work in Terminator, he makes a terrible Mr. Freeze. He's supposed to be a serious, intelligent and emotionless villain but Arnold plays him like completely wrong.  The love of his life is frozen. Screw playing the character like he's sad about that, light up another sub-frozen cigar instead.  It makes no sense.  Uma is trying to be a sleek and sexy and while Poison Ivy is a seductive character she just doesn't muster up the strength.  Bane...there was no reason for him to show up.  They were just trying to pull all the stops on this movie because they knew it was going to go belly up.  They even tried to throw Batgirl in here, who was scripted as being Alfred's daughter, no Commissioner Gordon's.  Of course, in the other movies, they didn't really show the work-together relationship of Batman and Gordon. So in order to make their devious little plan work, they had to cut a few corners.  Alicia Silverstone is cute but she was unnecessary in this movie.I heard they were going to try to start over again by making an origin movie called Batman: Year One.  It used to be listed here on IMDB but must have canceled production or postponed it for whatever reason.  At least for a while we had Batman: the Animated Series which was far better than any movie because it stayed true to the comics. It makes me sad that this franchise is dead.  We needed Keaton.",Batman & Robin
310,ufo0001,Why did they do this?,1,3 May 2002,"Pros: NoneCons: Charcaters, script, directing, score.Goldsman and Schumacher did the unthinkable, they killed batman. One reviewer suggested that Schumacher must have overdosed of the campy 60's series and I think he was right. Why oh why did they have to make batman gay. Why was Arnuld casted as Mr freeze instead of Patrick stewart. Why was there a Batgirl. She is supposed to be commisioner gordon's daughter, not Alfred's neice. Why was Bane, batman's greatest villian, who destroyed batman reduced to a steroid popping freak. Why was poison ivy in this flick. Why was there bad dialogue (""A freeze is coming"" and ""everybody chill""). These questions will go unanswered. Akiva Goldsman does not deserve an oscar for a beautiful mind when he wrote the two worst batman movies and Lost in space. Schumacher hopefully will not be allowed near a big budget production ever again. Most of the blame fell on Clooney but he has shown he is a versatile and good actor. Elliot Goldenthal cannot score a movie to save his life. Warner Bros and Schumacher deserve this flick as it proves that if you fix something that isn't broke, the fans will react. Right now they are scrambling to get the franchise back on its feet and return to the original Tim Burton's vision. Batman, year one will be directed by Aronofsky, an accomplished dark director. This is a step in the right direction but I fear it is too late, Goldsman and Schumacher have done something the joker could never do, they killed batman.Premise: Batman, Robin, and Batgirl battle Bane, Mr freeze and Poison Ivy.Grade: 0/10 (Doesn't even deserve this review)",Batman & Robin
311,joben-525-633946,Undignified and ridiculously stupid...however it may raise a chuckle or two.,1,20 December 2012,"'Batman & Robin ' is undoubtedly the worst superhero movie of all time to date. It is awful in almost every aspect with very few positives you will be able to accumulate. However - strangely I agree - Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane (Schwarzenegger, Thurman, Swenson) are able to claw Joel Schumacher's dreadful efforts some bizarre credibility in my eyes. Why? Has he lost his mind (me)? Well perhaps, though I find the performances from the villainous trio so corny and over exaggerated its quite simply hilarious! Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Freeze is so obviously humorous due to the amount of clichéd puns and one liners that Schumacher managed to cram into his script; this on top of the fact that Schwarzenegger's acting abilities are aren't the best paves way for some enjoyable comedic parody moments.Meanwhile, Uma Thurman, who we now all know for her astounding performances in Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' and 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' was so false as the evil temptress she made accusations that the World was going to end on 21/12/2012 seem possible! Again, full of woefully out of place dialogue, she proves to be another bizarrely entertaining highlight.Also, lets not forget Jeep Swenson's humiliation at the hands of Schumacher with the way he was forced to portray the brainless Bane. He appears in comparison to a cross between a bear and an idiot which may lose the character's credibility, but will raise an eyebrow or perhaps a chuckle.The narrative - does it need explanation? Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) must try to protect Gotham citizens from the hands of the high profile lunatics Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and Bane (Joel Swenson).In some cases, some decent battles are fought between O'Donnell and Clooney against their nemesis' but for the most part, highlights are only present because the movie is so abysmally awful!",Batman & Robin
312,ARTaylor,We Should Thank Joel Schumacher,1,10 September 2006,"Don't get me wrong. This movie is bad. And I mean bad bad. I wouldn't use the DVD as a frisbee. This movie sucked. But that's not what I mean when I say we should thank Schumacher.I mean that this is the movie that ended campiness. Finally movie executives realized that audiences didn't want campy movies and we were able to get serious comic books movies.Everyone knows of the Adam West version of Batman. If you didn't watch the show like I did then you at least know of a parody of it. The show was not done if full seriousness. It was done somewhat as a joke and audiences loved it. Hey, this was the 60's.But somewhere along the line executives got themselves mixed up. They thought that all audiences loved campiness and wanted to see more of it.Then came Superman. Richard Donner made the first one which was a success, but wasn't campy. Executives thought that the movie would have been more of a success if it was campier. Donner was fired because he didn't want to make Superman II more campy.Enter Richard Lester. Superman II was a success, in part due to Donner filming most of it before he left, so he came back for Superman III. It was full of campiness. That movie sucked. Audiences didn't like it. But the campiness didn't end there.Now it's the 80's. Comics are getting darker. The stories more serious. And audiences soaking it up. But the executives still didn't get it. They could only think of Adam West's Batman.It's 1989. Tim Burton made Batman the movie. People loved it and it became the first summer blockbuster. Some slight campiness came from Jack Nicholson's legendary performance as The Joker. Then came Batman Returns. The movie was far darker and more serious without any campiness. Though it was a great success, the executives didn't like it.Burton didn't come back for Batman 3. Schumacher came on board promising the campiness from the 60's. Batman Forever came out to mixed reviews and a modest gross. Executives loved it because they thought that's exactly what audiences wanted. It wasn't.Time for Batman & Robin. It came out with even more campiness than the last Batman movie. And audiences hated this movie to death. George Clooney feels so bad that if you say you paid to see this movie he'll actually give you your money back. No joke.FINALLY! Executives got the idea. It finally got through their think heads. Audiences didn't want to see campy movies. They wanted to see superheroes being superheroes.This movie paved the way for far more serious comic adaptations. Spider-Man, X-Men, Blade, Hellboy, Daredevil, Hulk, etc. Were it not for Schumacher those movies might have been done with the same level of campiness and not the seriousness that they were made with.So thank you Joel Schumacher. If you had not gone to such an extreme campy movies might still be made. It was only because you made such an awful movie that the concept was finally put to rest. I thank you not for the movie itself, but for what it did for all comic book movie adaptations. I don't know if this just happened, or if you intended to show such an extreme. But campiness is over and done with and it is all thanks to your movie.I think I speak for all comic book fans when I say thank you for, in effect, making following comic book movies serious. Thank you.",Batman & Robin
313,Chris-332,On my top 5 Worst Movies list.,1,16 August 1999,"After I saw this movie, I finally agreed with myself. The Batman series has become a wreck. I thought it would end after Batman Forever, that Warner Bros. would hire Tim Burton and Sam Hamm again, and that Joel Shumacher would be forgotten. Sadly, I was wrong. Joel Shumacher and Akiva Goldsman are back, giving us an even CAMPIER movie! The dialogue in this movie is laughable! Why did THE MAN, Arnold Schwarzenegger, even CONSIDER doing this Bat-Bomb?! There is absolutely NO story to this movie. Batman Forever had a very small and lousy story, but at least it had one! This was just Batman and Robin fighting Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, with some pointless love triangles which go NOWHERE, and Robin arguing with Batman. That's it. Some scenes in this movie were flat out unwatchable( i.e., the Robin Signal, the sky boarding scene, and the Batman credit card scene). It's so sad. Batman and Batman Returns, in my opinion, were the best comic book/superhero movies of all time. Then came Batman Forever, an atrocity to Bat Fans but still a passable movie. And now this, the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. Joel Shumacher should just go back to filming drama thrillers, because, obviously, he knows nothing about action films.",Batman & Robin

Everybody in this movie did a horrible job.  The only things about this movie I liked was the Smashing Pumpkin's theme song and Mr.Freeze's costume.
Batman was dull.  Robin was an idiot.  Everything about Batgirl was handled wrong (the 3 ""C's"": casting, costume, characterization). Why does Barbara Gordon (whoops, I forgot she's not Commisioner Gordon's daughter anymore...they couldn't even get THAT right) even BECOME Batgirl?!?!?! NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE MAKES SENSE!!!!!  Mr.Freeze was corny.  Poison Ivy was too ridicules.  The only descent character in this film, Alfred, is misused as the ""I'm dying, please cure me"" character.This very well might be the worst movie ever made.

316,ShinKyo81,"I have seen bad, disappointing films, but this one...",1,9 July 2001,"""Batman & Robin"" is a bad film. It's sad but true, because it could have been a quite interesting movie, not an academy award, but enjoyable. Joel Schumacher made a fine sequel of the Batman saga with the ""FOREVER"" part. It wasn't as brilliant as the two Burton's first films, but it gave a different point of view of the adventures of the Gotham hero.The plot is incredibly messy, with no sense and total disorder. We have Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), that are not as brilliant as Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito and the other actors who gave life the other villains of the saga.Then, George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell are Batman and Robin, the dynamic duo, not dynamic enough this time, despite Alicia Silverstone's incorporation in the good guys team as Batgirl.""Batman & Robin"" is just rubbish. Ok, when the film was on TV I recorded it and kept it in my shelf next to the other three Batman films. And I've seen it twice and I've survived :) However, it's not a film to watch at the cinema, but I did it, and that's a thing I will remember during all my life: I gave 4.5 dollars to Joel Schumacher for a very bad film.

317,garrettderose,What a bat-turd,2,24 September 2009,"As a good friend of mine said, this movie would be acceptable if they inserted laugh-tracks throughout the whole film. It's almost as if they ad-libbed everything in this whole film. Mr. Freeze steals diamonds... then escapes in a rocket that's built to blow up? WTF? That scene was just a setup to have Batman and the Boy Wonder flying down on surfboard-gliders. I remember when this film was being promoted, and I was really intrigued/revved up by that short sequence.It's just as silly and forced as every other scene in this god-forsaken film. Before I ramble on too far, I'd like to simplify this review with a pros and cons list.Pros: Schwartzenegger making 'ice' and 'cold' puns with every piece of dialog. Wait. That's a con. Let's start with the Cons.Cons: Butter-faced Bat-Girl Alicia Silverstone. She delivers lines that are worthy of the teenage sister in Troll 2.The props were terrible and obviously fake. Translucent pieces of plastic should never be passed as Ice, especially if you're gonna do long close-up shots that would further reveal their flaws.The butt/crotch/sexy-bat shots. What the heck? The movie OPENS with a shot that shows off Bat-Man's package/anus. What sort of target audience were they catering to? Most of the die-hard DC/Batman fans I know aren't in it for the Bat-A$$ or Bat-dong.Uma Thurman's acting was passable... but Poison Ivy was an extremely unnecessary character.Robin is fighting with Poison Ivy's vines in a pool of water. As he surfaces for air, instead of completing the shot and having him get pulled under - the 'clever' editing behind this film reveals that they just reversed the footage. The last time I saw something like that was when it was intentional, and was part of a montage on America's Funniest Home Videos. Fail.The over-use of 'twisted angles' on everything... the whole motorcycle chase scene. It was terrible.Clicking the knees together to produce Bat-Ice-Skates.Every piece of dialog.OK, I'll stop there... let's get to the pros.Pros: ... ... ... I lied. There isn't any.",Batman & Robin

319,griffin84,"Schumacher, what were you thinking??",1,13 May 2003,"OK, I'm a devoted fan of Batman, and I went into this movie with high hopes... only to have them dashed.  This movie was a complete waste of time, and I want my $8 back!This movie is faulted from the very start; nothing fits well, and it doesn't even remotely come close to the comic books (or even the cartoon series for that matter).  First of all, let's take a look at the acting.  George Clooney is a great actor (I loved him in ""One Fine Day"" and ""From Dusk till Dawn""), but he doesn't have what it takes to pull off a decent Batman.  I wanted to give him credit for being a decent Bruce Wayne, but I couldn't even do that; his roles just scream, ""Look everyone!  It's George Clooney!"", not the mystery and intensity we've grown to love as Batman.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr. Freeze pretty well (at least he got into character and had fun with it), but I would not have picked someone like him to do the role.  First of all, it's impossible to get over the accent; Mr. Freeze didn't have an accent in the comics or cartoon series, and Schwarzenegger's accent is just too strong and too much of a trademark to not notice.  Plus, if I remember correctly, Mr. Freeze was always portrayed as a ""small guy"" who got big in the suit; Schwarzenegger did a good job, but it would have been better if someone else was cast.  Chris O'Donnell, returning as Robin, was pretty much the only tolerable actor in the movie.  He seemed to be the only returning character that had actually matured and changed from the last one.  Robin is definitely over his quest for revenge and now just wants Batman to treat him like a partner instead of a sidekick; O'Donnell played that to a T, and I was very impressed.This would be the part where I trash the female leads (Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl), but I find that I can't.  It wouldn't be fair to either of them because the roles they played were terrible to begin with.  Poison Ivy was always one of my favorite villains in the cartoon series, just because she was so interesting in her quest to avenge plants and flowers.  However, the role doesn't transfer well enough onto film, and we find ourselves just laughing at Thurman (who does seem to put up a good fight as her character) and thinking, `Come on, she's supposed to be a bad guy?'  Sorry, but her role was just too stupid to take seriously.  The same goes for Silverstone as Batgirl.  I was extremely disappointed in Schumacher's take on Batgirl's character, changing it so she would be Alfred's niece instead of Commissioner Gordon's daughter.  Batgirl was never really a partner of Batman & Robin; she ran independently from the Caped Crusaders and helped them out whenever she could.  She as well was given a pretty lousy part and I'm sorry, but the idea of Batgirl fighting in high heels was pretty stupid.The whole script is in need of a serious do-over.  Schwarzenegger had some of the cheesiest lines I've ever heard (`Very ice'), the ending was rather lousy and I just couldn't believe to be scientifically correct, and (slight spoiler herein) I didn't understand the scene after Batman, Robin, & Batgirl escape from Poison Ivy and head off to stop Mr. Freeze.  If they were in such a rush to get there, then how were they able to get back to the Bat Cave and get the new vehicles and new costumes?  Sorry, just not believeable (I'm not even going to get into the airfight scene after the rocket explodes or the chase scene where they start racing around on the giant statues).
However, there is one major problem that, no matter how hard I try, I can't overlook: THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT JUST LIKE THE LAST MOVIE!  `Batman & Robin' simply has way too many copies from `Batman Forever', including the fight scenes involving the bad guy's henchmen, the opening segments where we see our good guys getting dressed in their outfits, and scenes where one of the main characters crashes through a glass window on the ceiling (Batman did it at Ed Nygma's party in `Forever', and both he and Batgirl did it in this movie).  It looks just way too similar to the last movie; part of why I liked ""Batman Forever"" was because it was a major change; ""Batman & Robin"" changed nothing.  While watching this, I started to wonder whether or not they had simply borrowed footage from `Forever'.  Sorry Schumacher, learn to develop some different ideas.Overall, I was disgusted by this movie.  If you want to see Batman, then I suggest renting the original or `Batman Returns', or even `Batman Forever'. `Batman & Robin' is just awful, plain & simple.",Batman & Robin
320,SylvesterFox007,Not That Bad,7,10 July 2005,"Not that great, either. Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true, but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.Seeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see ""Batman & Robin."" But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure, his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact, cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.George Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately, he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable, he still said them with a straight face, as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but, even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea, the character should be played with some darkness.Still, there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough, who plays Alfred the butler, and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel, who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred, his friend and mentor, is dying, and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.The plot is completely preposterous, but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive, the action scenes are well done, and the Batmobile, as always, is cool. The lead actresses, Elle MacPherson, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman, as the evil Poison Ivy, possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me, since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.If I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies, I'd pick this one. Still, it's light entertainment, and worth a look.",Batman & Robin
321,Flak_Magnet,A monumental cinematic meltdown,1,10 September 2009,"Ouch -- the infamous ""Batman & Robin."" Picked this up at Entertainmart for like four bucks this week. Yeah, it sucks, BUT its also pretty funny and has quite a few quotable dialog segments. My personal favorite was: ""I'm a lover, not a fighter. That's why every Poison Ivy action figure comes with HIM!"" Yeah...In all honesty, though, I think a movie this terrible is really beyond criticism. I mean, the opening shot is of Batman's butt. Then his crotch. Then Robin's butt. Then Robin's crotch. If you have not seen ""Batman & Robin"" and are curious, prepare to be either amazed or somewhat offended by its curious level of badness. This is very unlike the other Batman movies and its really somewhat of a unique animal entirely. Similar to other studio disasters like ""Zardoz"" and ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Batman & Robin"" is an impossibly bad, expensive mosaic of failure, with nearly every stakeholder missing the mark bafflingly. You simply won't believe it until you see it. ---|--- Reviews by Flak Magnet",Batman & Robin
322,timefreezer7,The most underrated adventure in film history,9,24 May 2001,"What 's the matter with you people ? OK I understand if English talking people dislike the movie because it has many silly pans , especially by Mr Freeze e.g. "" Let 's kick some ice "" . But I cannot understand why European viewers have slaughtered the film so much . Alright I admit that the jokes are beyond silly but who CARES ? This is not a comedy it is an adventure and it should be treated like that .What 's the story ? Batman ( George Clooney ) and Robin ( Chris O' Donnell ) must face a new threatening villain , the ice - cold Mr Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) . Dr Victor Fries as it is his real name is , was a brilliant scientist who was forced to put his wife Nora  in cryogenic condition until he could find a cure for her rare disease. An unfortunate accident ( falling into a vat of freezing solution ) disfigured him irrepairably . He can now survive only under extremely cold conditions . So he has developed an armoured suit which keeps his body temperature below zero . He also invented a freezing gun which can make his victums solid ice crystals . So he begins a crusade to freeze the entire world . Halfway he forms an uneasy alliance with the deadly charming Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) a mutated creature with the power of bewitching men and killing them off with a poisonous kiss on the lips. Dr Pamela Isley as she was once called was a botanist working in a lab in South America . She loves plants as anything else and hates the irresponsible humans who keep raping Earth and destroying the environment . After an accident she mutates and reborn as the venomous Poison Ivy who regards herself as an incarnation of mother - nature. She wants the plants to take over the world and wants to eliminate the Caped Crusaders in order not to be in her way !There are many other subplots but I won 't say more . The writers did a great job wrapping the 7 - 8 subplots in a neat little package . Kudos also to the director Joel Schumacher for some really inspired action sequences ( with the exception of the ice - hockey in the beginning of the film which is very stupid ) . The freezing missile , the jail breakout and the scene in Mr Freeze 's lab where he frosts the cops .This is a major improvement over the disappointing "" action "" scenes of Batman Forever ( some contrived car chases , bad shot and unsatisfactory ) .I hate it when people say "" what a silly movie ! How rediculous idea the cold energy generating from diamonds . How ridiculous the alliance between the 2 villains ! Why the Batgirl character is now Alfred 's niece since she was Commissioner Gordon 's daughter ? Oh my God what a disgrace for the comic tradition !!!!!! "" In a strange way these are the same people who are praising the dark like hell "" Batman Returns "" . ARE YOU SERIOUS ???? If so , then do you know that the Penguin is traditionally an aristocratic arch - criminal and NOT a disfigured genetically mutant ? Did you ever wonder why Catwoman wanted to kill Batman  since he saved her life ? And why did she not kill her boss instantly since he was the one she hated instead of going through all this ordeal ? She could have spared herself ( and us ) from sewing up that leather costume and fighting Batman if she simply took a gun and shot Shreque . By the way did you ever wonder where the Penguin found all these rocket missiles ? And what kind of plot is THAT ? The penguin wanting to kill all the firstborn boys of the city ??? Where did they come up with this ??? The 10 Commandments maybe ?????????????!!!!!!!!I think I have made my point . Don 't get me wrong , I LOVE Batman Returns . But these movies are FAIRY TALES and should not be taken seriously . We should enjoy them as fairy tales . If B&R has a major flaw is the total absence of Gothism . Regard it as a break from the dark 3 previous installments . That does NOT mean is campy ( despite the corny jokes ) as many suggest . It is a very good adventure . All the performances are great , Mr Freeze is terrific is his frosted Robocop -eque appeareance gives you chills ( this is not a pan ) and basically steals the show . The sets / costumes / make -ups are virtually STUNNING and groundbreaking . The climax of the Gotham city freezing is the best action sequence in the entire series and the Batman Vs Freeze final battle is simply titanic and divine . And finally the villains are not evil . They DO have motives and you end up liking them.Don 't listen to anyone . Even you who hate it give it another chance. Forget the c**p one - liners and the absence of dark . See it for what it IS . A great roaller - coaster with much humanism and emotion.BATMAN AND ROBIN                    8.5 / 10",Batman & Robin
323,Herbest8,Quite an embarrassment,5,11 June 2010,"As a devoted Batman fan, I feel particularly embarrassed by this film. It's so hard to believe this is the fourth in a series that began so damn well and has devolved into an acid trip-laced cartoon.The story? Do you really care? All I'll say is Batman and Robin and Batgirl (yes, she's here too) fight the combined threat of Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy.Where do I begin? Well, why don't I just keep it short and sweet and try and list all the horrendous ingredients that went into this bomb? Here they are: lame puns, bad acting (Chris O'Donnell), bland acting (George Clooney), lousy acting (Uma Thurman), a ridiculous story, bombastic action, a total lack of solidity, Alicia Silverstone, pointless action scenes (what was with the biker chase?) and a nauseating color scheme.Being generous, I will say this. Some of the cameos are amusing (Coolio, John Ingle, Vivica A. Fox and Jesse Ventura) and John Glover is delightful as a mad scientist but what else can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?Nothing. But it still SUCKS.",Batman & Robin
324,Jakethemuss,beyond garbage,1,2 July 2007,"Quite possibly the easiest 1 star rating I'll ever give, as this film is absolutely dire, to the point where I thinks Joel Schumacer (not a bad director usually) directed this in a drunken stupor.Think back to the original Tim Burton creation with an effective Batman (Michael Keaton) and a sinister Joker (Jack Nicholson), great film all would agree. It was dark, Gothic and stylish, just like it was supposed to be. The franchise Begin to loose its way at Batman Forever, which was when Schumacer stepped into the chair. The characters suddenly became hammy and slapstick, the lines become dumbed down and often banal, but worst, there was an introduction of bright neon colours to replace the original darkness. What happened? Where was the DARK knight during this camp extravaganza? But Batman and Robin blew Batman Forever off the tracks in terms of pure awfulness. Almost every character without exception was 2 dimensional, irritating, childish and collectively uttered the worst script known to cinema. Clooney does a terrible job as the caped crusader, adding absolutely no depth or mystery to the character whatsoever. In this, Batman is basically your average guy, disgraceful if you ask me. Casting Clooney was merely an attempt to try and pull audiences into this sub-standard excuse for a movie.His enemies in this outing were Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bain. The ""fight"" scenes were poorly executed in such a childish, taim, cartoonish style, I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a Batman spoof!! This also features Alicia Silverstone, who turns out to be nothing more than eye candy. An example of this being the camera focusing in on her bottom and breasts the moment shes fitted into her Batgirl suit. She plays here role with too much 'cutesy' glamour and literally no content.All in all, a no good waste of time. The sheer awfulness of this film has been made even more apparent by the vastly superior ""Batman Begins"", which thwarted this camp,retarded monstrous creation back to the abyss, which is where it belongs. Excuse me for speaking about this in the past tense, I only saw it once, and like to think that was once too many!!",Batman & Robin
325,andrew_flay,Let me explain...,7,26 August 2017,"Let me explain when i was a kid i thought this film was the bees knees, back then i was a fool, I've given this film such a high rating because this film can not be taken seriously, i consider this film a comedy.

326,JoshuaMLosapio,A Great Big Bat-Bomb,1,16 September 2019,"So much has already been said about ""Batman & Robin"" it's hard to add anything new: we all know the story is a mess, the acting is phoned in, the dialogue is unbearable, the music is overblown, the special effects look fake, the costumes are embarrassing, and that these elements combined to result in a film so bad it killed the ""Batman"" franchise for eight years. The fact that Joel Schumacher actually apologized for making the film speaks for itself.Aside from one brief, touching scene where Bruce Wayne looks back on his childhood, every single aspect of the film falls flat. And unlike ""The Room,"" ""Batman & Robin"" isn't an entertainingly bad movie. It's a lifeless, inane film with nothing for the viewer to latch onto other than the hope that the credits will roll as soon as possible. I could end my review there, but that would miss the most important takeaway from ""Batman & Robin."" George Clooney has said that he keeps a picture of himself as Batman on his office wall as a reminder of what happens when you make a movie purely for the sake of money. ""Batman & Robin"" failed because the producers paid no attention whatsoever to making quality entertainment - instead their sole purpose was to churn out a profit. They rushed production on the film and crammed in as much as they could in the vain hope of expanding the merchandising sales on that extra villain or maybe that one last Batsuit - whether or not those ideas actually fit into the film. The result was a disaster - and a valuable lesson for future filmmakers.Thankfully Christopher Nolan learned that lesson and gave us the excellent ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. But I really wish that sitting through ""Batman & Robin"" wasn't the price we had to pay. 1/10.",Batman & Robin
327,TheMunkeyBoy,Hated it in '97. KIDS LOVE IT.,6,12 April 2020,"I remember seeing this at the cinemas, I was 20. I wasn't expecting much as I didn't like Batman Forever.
Loved the first 2 Burton films though.But.... my kids love this movie and Batman Forever.
I get it. It works for them. They are 7 and 11. And my eldest one of 15 loved this when he saw it as a 9 YO.They want to see Batman that isn't a cartoon and seems real to them. These 2 Schumacher movies Work perfect for that.As a Batman fan I give it a 4 out of 10. But for my kids I give it an 8.
So we will meet that in the middle with a 6/10.
It's a family superhero movie.",Batman & Robin
328,DanielRobertRoss,"Not the worst movie ever, but...",2,21 February 2016,"What else is there to say about this film that hasn't been said a million times before about Joel Schumacher's infamous franchise killer? Bat nipples, bat credit card, ""You're not sending ME TO THE COOLER!!!"" Online critics have picked it apart like a cat unraveling a poorly made sweater with it's claws. So I'm not going to analyze the film and it's flaws. There's hours worth of footage online for that. I'll simply make a case against it being as bad as people claim. Is it really that bad? Kinda. Worst movie ever though? I wouldn't go that far, in my opinion if a movie is so bad that you can laugh at how absurd it is, you've got entertainment there. The riffing that you can do with friends while watching this movie stoned and howling your ass off makes it a hell of a good time. Plus Uma Thurman is hot as Poison Ivy. Schwarzenegger is hilariously over the top as Mr Freeze, the one liners themselves make it worth your time. Batman and Robin belongs to a special club of movies that are so bad that they're enjoyable: Manos: The Hands of Fate, The Room, Troll 2, Birdemic and Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas. Invite friends round, inhale copious amounts amounts of marijuana, chuck the film in, and laugh your ass off.",Batman & Robin
329,pitsburghfuzz,The Satan of Film: Batman and Robin,1,3 April 2010,"Well, you have to give Joel Schumacher credit...FOR CREATING ONE OF THE WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME. I mean, you have to make new adjectives to describe how atrocious this film is. I would like to talk to the person who claimed that Plan 9 was the worst film ever made and show them the true horrors of how bad cinema CAN be. It is really hard for me to watch a movie and not say there is NOTHING salvageable. Well, there is always the exception to the rule. Too many one-liners, bad acting, and making it too similar to the Adam West series. For that time period, it was appropriate to have campiness at that level, but in 1997, it was unacceptable. This gives me more fuel to hate George Clooney, more reason to say that Batman is not the coolest superhero, and even though Spiderman 3 was bad, at least it made a decent attempt at film making. This ""film"" proves that most crimes can be forgiven, so long as they are not making Batman and Robin.",Batman & Robin
330,TheFilmConnoisseur,Batman & Robin: The Great Disappointed,1,22 April 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorBatman & Robin is the type of film that puts tears on children's eyes. And the tears are of sadness over the assassination of one of the greatest heroes of all-times. While attempting to bring back the spirit of the `60s Batman TV show to the fourth installment of the Batman franchise. Where director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman failed is in the humor. The `60s Batman TV show had a Austin Powers type quality that helped it to it's advantage. However, bringing the Adam West Batman back to the big screen was not the appropriate way to go. The character of Mr. Freeze, a man who is willing to fight for a cure to safe his wife and kill anyone who stands in his way had the potential to make this a dark movie. Instead Schumacher gave us a campy and comedic Mr. Freeze along with the campy and dumb humor, neon city, and nipples on the bat suit.Everything was just wrong in this movie. Especially George Clooney, who was physically the best Bruce Wayne/Batman but gave the worse performance. His performance was so bad that he forgot to do a different voice as Batman.

331,jeremyrhess,annoying and stupid,4,12 November 2021,"This movie was a challenge to get thro, the characters annoyed me, every single one of them good and bad. The overall story was fine but the way they went about it made it stupid and rediculous.",Batman & Robin
332,forrestwrs,The Casablanca Of Bad Screenplays,1,12 September 2010,"Oh, man. The first major problem with this movie is the title. This movie is not so much about Batman and Robin as it is about Mr. Freeze and Batgirl. The instant this movie appeared, it became every punch line to any movie joke regarding clichés, puns, bad villains, bad heroes, bad acting, bad writing, bad logic, and bad superhero movies in general.There is so much to be said about this screenplay. The Casablanca of bad screenplays, Batman and Robin not only use every cliché and pun in the book, but it fails to produce even one line of dialogue that isn't absolutely terrible. Such horrible lines as ""Ice to see you!"" ""Chill... Chill..."" ""Rubber lips are immune to your charm!"" and ""Tonight, Hell freezes over!"" It got to the point that it was beyond annoying. The dialogue was insufferable.And that ridiculous screenplay may be an excuse for the god-awful acting. Up to a point. And everyone from George Clooney to Arnie Schwartzenegger jumps over that line. Arnold plays what is probably one of the worst villain performances in the history of cinema (after Terl). He's over the top, campy, and just plain goofy. In contrast to that is George Clooney who gives the worst performance I've ever seen from him. In contrast to Arnold, Clooney plays a particularly dull and lifeless Batman and an equally emotionless Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell is over the top and Alicia Silverstone forces every line like she has no idea what's going on. Uma Thurman, meanwhile, doesn't really play an awful Poison Ivy. Of course, it could just be that everyone else on screen is so terrible that hers is just considerably less terrible by comparison.The action sequences in the first couple Batman movies weren't spectacular, but Burton seemed to know his limitations and gave us more character development instead. Batman and Robin, on the other hand, seemed blissfully unaware of the horrid nature of the campy and ludicrousness of its action. It's loud, it's stupid, and it's utterly humiliating to watch.All in all, Batman and Robin is so bad it's a joke.1/10",Batman & Robin
333,fjustice,Come on - Batman and Robin - a sure fire loss in the series,1,26 April 2002,"I WAS PUMPED TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I loved the first, I enjoyed the second, and I loved the third. This was the fourth. June 20, 1997 was going to be a great day; for I was going to see the movie I had wanted to see for three and a half months.I got to the theater and we sit down. The movie started the same as 'Batman Forever' (1995), but the only difference was music. IT IMMEDIATLEY SUCKED. This was not Batman. It hurt me to wonder where the series would be.Clooney was an awful Batman. He wouldn't change his tone and just sucked. O' Donnell did play his role better as Robin, but could not control what he got in a script. Arnold Schwartzeneeger played an alright Mr. Freeze, but I think he overdid a few scenes, but still did ok. Uma Thurman wasn't Poison Ivy. A Good Pamela Isely, but couldn't make Poison Ivy. The spotlight in this film goes to Alicia Silverstone, who pulled off both Barbara and Batgirl perfectly. SHE DID GREAT!I am only giving it this score because of Alicia Silverstone's exceptional acting in the movie, so only because of that it gets a 1 out of 5 stars.

336,brownish33,"Even though Batman should be Dark, this is still A lot OF FUN!!!",10,22 September 2007,"I am a major hardcore fan of the Tim Burton Batman films, because IMO those films portray the character and his world the best, even better then the newer Batman Begins. the first Batman film was amazing, it set the standard for most comic book films made since, and had amazing performances by jack nicholson and michael keaton, who is still for me the definitive Batman actor. the sequel Batman Returns is my favorite because it actually managed to top the original for BEING original and not just a copy and paste of the first film. it also had a GREAT emotional edge not seen before or since in comic book film, and really made you feel for the characters, unlike the first film where it was just nutto joker and downer batman as usual. but the new batman was just boring, plain and simple. in fact, its batman begins that prompted me to write a review of the this movie, because of my dislike for the new batman. i recently bought the Batman Anthology on DVD because i love all the Batman films, even the silly campy Schumacher ones. for me, there is always something to love about these batman films, heck, even the new one. i am not a comic book reader, i hate the comics. i just never got into them. but the movies really ROCK! i love the movies, and will always hope that they make more. however, this particular batman movie gets the most hate, and i can clearly see why, but i think it gets too harshly criticized when this film is indeed a heck of a lot of fun, full of laughs, over the top action and stunts, and really feels like a comic book out of the 60's or 50's that its based. George Clooney is OK when hes batman, though hes not really what you would call ""badass"" or ""cool"", but his suit looks amazing and makes him looks very cool even with the nipples, which i never noticed before until all these nerds started brining them up. i still don't mind them. and lets just say that i can tolerate Clooney's batman more because his voice is more easy to listen as batman, unlike the recent Christian bale, who sounded like he had to have his voice altered by computers with a mixture of dogs barking and engines turning over. Clooney's wayne can be annoying at times, always smirking like a loser, i hated those parts. but it didn't ruin the film. the villains are fun and cool (no pun intended), especially Arnold who plays a wickedly hysterical Mr.Freeze, he practically steals the movie with his pretty hysterically bad puns and one liners and freeze suit, which also looks amazing. Uma Thurman as poison ivy is not really that good, shes just not a good looking woman to me, so i never found her sexy or attractive all that much, and shes very over the top, which made me kinda cringe at times. robin is, well, robin. hes constantly whining about Bruce not trusting him, but i didn't mind him. i mean, hes Robin. i'd expect that from robin too. Alicia Silverstone is the weak spot, i really wasn't nuts about her character, and i always hated Bat girl to begin with. but shes OK, she doesn't ruin the film. shes not that bad when shes finally becomes batgirl, but the film could have done without her character or batgirl. the new batmobile is awesome, its more like a kids toy but heck, i owned it as a kid so i always thought it was cool, even though it had no hood which was strange, but at least it still retained that Batmobile hotrod look we are used too, unlike that new horrible piece of crap the Tumbler, which is just a tank and looks horrendous as a batmobile. anyways, batman and robin is also very colorful, which is a stark contrast to the Tim Burton films which were more realistic and dark, and not very bright at all. i like that look, but the colors in this one don't hurt the film. not very batman-y, but the film is so much fun it doesn't even matter. and the batmobile isn't the only bat-vehicle thats new, you got robins Redbird motorcycle, Batgirls cycle, and my personal favorite, the Bathammer, batmans new toy that can slide over ice and take out villains! cool moment with all 3 vehicles. all in all, i didn't hate this film as much as i used too, its actually quite fun, and funny too! i also would NOT count this movie as any kind of sequel to the Tim Burton masterpieces, nor would i say batman forever is sequel, they are there own thing, not sequels. i mean seriously, can you compare B&R to the burton movies? i didn't think so. but this movie is still a fun bat-filled ride!",Batman & Robin

So to see where the Batman movie franchise came from is indeed a pleasure, however, in this case, it's a painful pleasure.The production values for this film are absolutely, nerve shatteringly terrible. Not only does it look terrible, but the editing att imes is college student like. Some of the choreography staging is seriously TOO comic book like. There is far too much eye candy in this film, eye candy that is designed to distract the viewer from what is really happening on screen, which isn't very much at all.As for the characters, well.... They are a little left to be desired, the only decent character in this movie is Alfred Pennyworth, who is believable in his role, much unlike the rest.3's a crowd and with 3 baddies and 3 goodies, the screen looks ever so small and the action is equally as cramped, especially since most of Arnold Scwarchneggers lines/scenes look rushed as if he was in a hurry to get it over. Uma Thurman has literally took a leaf out of Jack Nicholson's book and attempted to ham it up to the extreme, which although makes her sexy as ever, demines her overall ability as an actor.Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone... well...And last but not least we have Batman, the caped crusader... George Clooney... Someone must have told him that if he shakes his head around a little bit, gurns like a druggy and delivers lines like puppet that he would be a good Bruce Wayne/Batman...Above all, this movie is terrible, it's worse than terrible, it's simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen...",Batman & Robin

It's not a perfect movie, by any means, but it has some really wonderful moments that I'll get to in a minute. I think that those who disliked this movie so intensely went into it expecting something else. For what it was, it was fine enough .. Surprises in this movie:Arnold Schwarzenegger can act.Elle Macpherson can act. Alicia Silverstone can really act Michael Gough can really, really act. His Alfred Pennyworth steals this movie out from under the bigger-named stars and super-heroic derring-do.Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen looks good, even pickled in brine. Two Sports Illustrated swimsuit models in one movie not about Sports Illustrated or swimsuits has to be a first .. The movie's best moment is the introduction of Poison Ivy ..as an instrumental version of the Coasters' hit played in the background! Now, *that's entertainment*! Ivy was the only character that didn't work for me. I loved her as the femme fatale who charmed her admirers with the pheromone dust, but she was a bit too psychotic. Nice stems, though. And buds. Schwarzenegger was fine as Freeze: too small, maybe, but he caught the sense of the character as I saw him just fine. When I looked, I saw Mr. Freeze, not Ah-nuld playing at being Mr. Freeze. This movie reminded me of Superman I in a lot of ways. The super-heroic derring-do and the super-villainous nefarious schemes were played to the hilt as cartoon-ish as possible. Outlandish, bizarre, too warped to be believed: freezing an entire city with an overgrown ray-gun .. Come on! But, where this movie redeems itself is in its moments at Wayne manor. Those were touching, warm, funny and very moving. I bought into the relationships of Bruce to Alfred, Bruce to Dick, and Barbara to Alfred. They seemed like real people.. a strange thing to say about a Batman movie to be sure .. that I cared about. Bruce calling Julie ""Ivy"" at one point was a nice touch. Director Schumacher has been caught up in the fan angst over this movie, because I've heard elsewhere that he has badmouthed his own movie. I don't share his feeling, or that of the rest of the IMDb.

But this is the true proof that maybe Schwarzenneger was cast in this movie, just because he's a big name.Whatever, on to the review. Oh, this movie is bad! I guess that the main problem about it is the villains. They're pretty stupid and silly! I didn't have much against Batman and Robin, well, maybe just a bit. I didn't like the bat-girl much. She got into the heroine suit so fast and was already saying ""I wanna help Batman and Robin, even though she doesn't spoil that on earlier scenes. But the villains! I hated them like hell! Schwarzenneger and Uma Thurman never were so silly! Destroy the entire planet to become Adam and Eve themselves?! Thank god that Gotham City has an asylum! No wonder that this movie was nominated for the prize for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property in the Razzie Awards Category. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy is truly pathetic! She is killed by Dr. Woodrue (played by John Glover), a total lunatic who works in the same labs as her, and she becomes Poison Ivy and gets her revenge on him. Just like Selina Kyle with Max Shreck in Batman Returns. Pure imitation. Even Batman Forever has Tommy Lee Jones as a pure imitation of personality as of Jack Nicholson's in the first Batman movie. What a pity...Is Joel Schmarcher a bad director? I can't quite tell. Is George Clooney the worst batman? Well, he's not that bad, but Batman is a sinister hero, not a Bruce Wayne smiling at every corner like he is James Bond! And where the hell is that girl, Julie Madison? Sincerely it's not nice to leave holes in a plot script, so yes, we may say Schumarcher is a bad director. This was the job of the script writers, but Schumarcher is in the project too, isn't it? There is always the chance to disagree with an idea! Also, Elliot Goldenthal's score is much, much better than this! Watch Alien3, even though it's not a great movie too...At every scene the villains appear, it gives us the feeling for hope that this movie ends soon. Watch this movie only if you are a great fan of cinema, or of superhero movies or of Batman. Otherwise, stay very far!P.S.: After I finished writing this review, I saw that there are many IMDb reviewers who dare to say that this is probably the worst movie ever. There is no need at all to say this! True! This is not a good film, it's pretty bad, but it's long to be the worst movie ever. People who say this sure don't have a good universal look on movies. Not even I dare say that the Friday the 13th movies are the worst ones, even though they really are much much worse than Batman & Robin.",Batman & Robin
341,abbatevittorio,"From the same maker of the Lost Boys, Joel Schumacher! A defense of a Masterpiece of the 90s (People are stupid, is isn't?)",10,22 January 2020,"Here we have a clear and precise example of how people and above all the critics decide to destroy for its brutality one of the nicest and funniest films in my opinion ever made in the history of cinecomics, even those of Batman, because in the end it is thanks just to Batman and Robin that we have the new films directed by the master Christopher Nolan, however made more seriously than this one, which in this case must entertain, not cry or intrigue the viewer.
Joel Schumacher, the great and magnificent director of this cult, is also the director of another 80's / 90's cinema cult, The Lost Boys, and it's not our fault that he has this style of making films. I like Schumacher a mess as a director, besides because he is openly homosexual like me, and I appreciate him very much, so there is no need to insult him, as he has also apologized for this ""fiasco""!
The cast is fantastic, it contains great actors, the music is fantastic (Elliot Goldenthal, one of my favorite) and it was very good. So just insult him and enjoy it, if not, go back to your serious film and make people cry after going to the cinema until the following morning. And have a laugh every now and then with a cinecomic!",Batman & Robin

344,axopnk,Things to learn from batman and robin,3,29 July 2008,"1. As a director it is VERY important to get a close up of Batmans ass going into the bat suit. This is to help the audience know that bat suit protects all vital areas.2. Superman does not want a partner because partners tend to want cars that chicks dig.3. Mr. Freeze, despite being a professor, has very a very limited vocabulary, which includes ice puns or sayings.4. Professional henchmen, mob etc. will gladly wear hockey mask and tights to match their bosses criteria for wardrobe.5. Heavy metal doors are the best for sky boarding, skydiving etc. and are known for their crisp clean accuracy and precision.6. Mr. Freeze, despite being unable to survive without sub cold temperatures, frequently smokes cigars.7. As a villain it is IMPORTANT to wear fuzzy slippers in front of your men and force them to sing songs like frosty the snowman etc. This helps ensure discipline and fear.8. Diamonds are typically used today as a source of energy for such things as power suits, weapons etc.9. Batman and robin, despite being busy with thugs mob bosses etc., have no problem making a appearance at foundations, benefits etc.10. Batman now has his own bank complete with credit card.11. Both batman and robin suits come standardized with hockey skates12. In terms of momentum, if you are riding down a statute, building etc. going about 70 mph, you will be are able to stop dead in your tracts, regardless of such scientifically proved concepts as speed, velocity, gravity. 13. Batman and robin typically fight over love or other emotional problems while fighting villains, thugs etc. This helps the villain understand that batman and robin have feelings like everyone else.14. Gangs today are all themed based. For example, one gang will all wear fluorescent colored clothes. This is done for fear and intimidation while showing the victim that themes and paint can be useful tools in your opponents mind. 15. Shopping carts are typically found in prison. 16. Officers, Despite being hit with a vapor that causes your lungs to freeze, are highly resistant and are known to survive.17. If you see a person get hit with a freeze gun DO NOT run, instead look at the person with the gun and either scream, jump at them, or charge towards them. Although ineffective, this causes the user to have momentary fear.18. As a girl/guy, despite having no formal training in combat, as long as you put on any variation of a bat suit, your skills will improve by a recorded 100%.19. Vines can be used as a whip and administer the same amount of damage 20. Despite having years of detective skills and deductive reasoning, batman has trouble identifying people who change their hair color , stop wearing glasses (Poison ivy) and people who wear mask large enough to cover the eye area (see Batgirl). 21. Concentrated sunlight from a powerful satellite, cannot be used to melt thing layers of ice on a mirror. Hand held lasers are the best for such problems.22. Through years of fighting together, batman, robin and bat girl have learned it is best to use language as a junior higher such as ""watch and learn little boy"" ""the heat is on"" ""chicks dig cars"" 23. Mr. Freeze, despite wanting to destroy the world, carries antidotes in his suit. Typically, most antidotes also come in a cool blue color.24. Most prisons still allow villains to wear battle suits despite being in prison. This is to ensure the prisoner is comfortable in his new surroundings.",Batman & Robin
345,Vassago,"It's not ONLY the worst ""Batman"" ever made...",8,14 December 2000,"I won't be very original saying this, but that's not only the worst Batman ever made (even the TV series was better) but also the worst movie I've ever seen. They even made Bane (an intelligent, sophisticated and educated man) into a brainless zombie on steroids. Please, someone resurrect the Joker, so he can take out Clooney's ""Batman"", O'Donnell's ""Robin"", and especially Silverstone & Thurman - they're responsible in 40% for making this movie such a pile of waste. But, of course, the ones who deserve to be given a dose of Smilex are the two people responsible for killing the Batman series - director Schumacher and writer Goldsman (or whatever their names are spelled).

Basically, the story is Batman has to stop Mr Freeze from taking over the world...for some reason, and a plant-woman called 'poison ivy'. Either way, they should forget it. Only Britain managed to do that successfully, nobody else has. And even that was only a measly quarter - don't patronise the audience! The dialogue is appalling, the one liners are boring, they don't even make you groan in a good way! The sets are horrible, the characters are horrible, the designs are horrible (bat nipples on the suits? The gay designer was clearly being very unprofessional!) in general, a horrible experience.

Although Nolen's version is the superior movie in both story and special effects I still enjoy Burton's take on Batman tremendously. When I went to see Batman Forever as a young teen I knew even then that something wasn't right in Gotham City. Everything was stupidly colorful and ridiculous, where was the dark tales of the previous saga, where was the Batman I was looking forward to seeing? Like I said I was young but this movie was for children... idiot children at that!!! The over the top acting (really, really over the top), the wooden personality of Bruce Wayne, and is Batman fighting street punks covered in glow sticks? Has there been a take over from ravenous hellbent ravers in Gotham, what is this horse $hit anyway?

350,ZekeRage911,Should be outlawed,1,28 December 2007,"Okay... I need to take a minute. My brother and I just tried to do a riff on Batman & Robin. We made it halfway through. It's just too awful.Now, I want to make this clear. I have several gay friends. I have no problem with homosexuality. I joke about it with my gay friends. I'm an open-minded guy.That said, this film was gayer than Richard Simmons humping Elton John in a feather boa during a musical about gay sex. And this is a movie listing Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Vivica Fox, and Elle MacPhearson on the cast. And YET... The first scene had two butt-shots of the main characters. There were nipples on the bat suits. Every statue in the background is holding either balls, or phallic buildings/objects. How Jerry Falwell caught the purple Teletubby but missed this movie is vastly beyond me. Every scene featuring two male actors has more sexual tension than a family dinner at the Osmand's. To say nothing of Bane's gimp mask.I never found Uma appealing in this movie, and it finally struck me why. She looks like a drag queen with lettuce on her face! The acting is nonexistent. The story is ludicrous. The pace is at once both breakneck and torturous. The dialogue is trite and cliché' with cheese oozing from every pore. Even Stan Lee is shaking his head at it. If Batman and Robin were any more gay, they'd be making out in their rubberized suits with bondage gear.I honestly can't find any redeeming quality to this movie. Even the humor is so poorly executed that it makes me want to shoot myself in depression.Now I knew I wasn't going to like this movie, but I thought I'd be able to tolerate it. A little over twenty minutes in, we had to stop. It was just too damn gay. I needed to drink some scotch and punch myself in the face for a half hour before I could go on, and we didn't make it much further.This movie should be destroyed, so that maybe civilization can thrive again.",Batman & Robin
351,Skeptic459,Take note all directors who enter into comic book territory.,2,11 December 2003,"There is an art to making films in the science fiction, fantasy or comic book genre. This film is bad because it can show all the traps that take material that is meant to be serious and dark and turns it into campy trash. The first Batman had a sense of humor but a very dark heart that stayed true to the original comic book material. Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin took that darkness and decided to make everything so over the top that any coherence of the weak story was lost. Everything in this film becomes lighthearted tongue and cheek. Its as if Schumacher was saying, 'you know its all so depressing, lets make it fun BY PUTTING NIPPLES ON THE BATSUITS!!!' Clooney kinda has a look that says 'Yeah, I am doing a Batman film. Ridiculous I know, but hey I'm getting paid.' The whole film is way to self conscious, it looks and feels like a bunch of bad actors playing comic book characters. This is totally different to the first two, which drew the viewer into its strange psychotic world of emotionally disturbed freaks.
None of the film works. Thurman is a sexy and talented actress but here goes way over the top, overacting into utter John Waters, Divine camp. Clooney is wooden and doesn't seem to know what to do with the role. I think he is miscast for this part. Keaton was much better at playing Batman because he could play a character that was distant, moody, restrained, introverted and slightly psychotic. O'Donnell is possibly one of the worst actors I have ever seen in Hollywood and should not be allowed to act. Silverstone is slightly better but is an annoying Californian valley girl. The Governor of California's performance is absolutely terrible and one of the worst things in the film. Schwarzenegger just does not have the emotional range to express Mr Freeze. That is quite funny when you consider that Freeze is a comic book character. Schwarzenegger is and has always been a terrible actor and he acts badly even in his best films. He is an action figure, nothing more, nothing less. He can't bring out Freeze's psychotic obsessions with any credibility. Remember the Penguin and the Joker, now there were two very well played psychotic characters.This film really shows how talented Tim Burton is and I am sure he is quite aware of this fact. Schumacher I have always thought is a hack. Most of his films are terrible and he deserves death for introducing Colin Farrell to the world of movies. Shumacher forgets that comic films not only have to take the material reasonably seriously but the films are not about the action scenes or the props. Comic books come back to the characters, fans dig the characters. Who are they? What motivates them? This is what turns the fans on. Schumacher fails because he decides not to portray any of the characters here with any depth. The film itself is extremely shallow. You can just hear someone saying 'But its just a comic book!' This in itself is no excuse. Even if it is a comic book it can still have emotional depth. Ang Lee's recent effort 'The Hulk' proved this.Finally this is just another wasted opportunity. I saw the first 3 on the big screen. However when I saw the third one, that was it, I knew the series had gone seriously downhill. I actually caught this one on Sky tv, years later. Its reputation is well deserved. I give this film 2 batarangs  out of 10 because some of the camp is funny. Its not as bad as say 'Captain America' but compare it to a solid superhero film like X2 and it is far worse. Avoid unless you liked the kitschy camp of the original series. This is actually ironic when you consider that they were originally trying to get away from Adam West's cheesy mardi gra of a series. They succeeded in turning it into just that. Liberace would have been very proud and a big fan I'm sure.",Batman & Robin

Val Kilmer could've done better.  Michael Keaton would've thrown out the script.  The redeeming quality is the action, but the lines were lame.

George Clooney isn't bad as Batman/Bruce Wayne, but he is wasted in the role, as is Uma Thurman who is good as Poison Ivy. The Mr. Freeze character was ridiculous; is this a Batman movie or a Saturday Morning kids show? Instead of focusing on characters & plot, like the first 2 movies, this movie instead throws in too many colors & characters.

355,Chris-999,"WARNING: If you like the other ones, DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!",1,1 August 2000,"Let's first start with the length. The movie was well over two hours and it definately didn't need to be. There were countless scenes that were completely unneccesary. WARNING SPOILER!! When Chris O'Donnell was chasing Alicia Silverstone(Batgirl)in a motorcycle chase and he discovered that she rides a motorcycle. So What!! The whole subplot about Alfred being sick was rediculous. It was perfectly clear that he was not going to die. He's a descent character why would they kill him(in case they make other Batman movies, which I hope they don't).END SPOILER!! Don't get me wrong, the other three were fine, but this was horrible.Next are the characters. George Clooney was dull and boring as Bruce Wayne and Batman. He was no match for Val Kilmer, who was by the way no match for Michael Keaton. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a good character for Mr. Freeze. But this is withoout a doubt not his best work. Chris O'donnell is not as good in this one as in the last. In the last one he seemed much more ambitious as a Super Hero than in this one. Uma Thurman wasn't bad as Poison Ivy, but she can't really pass as a Hollywood villian. Alicia Silverstone seems absolutely Clueless as Batgirl. She was much better in previous films(not including Excess Baggage). Finally the ending. It was not as intense and set in such a clever location as ANOTHER SPOILER! Batman(top of a church), Batman Returns(in then sewer), and Batman Forever(Two Faces' layer) END SPOILER!! There were no Surprises at all. All around it was horrible.

357,hippiegal,When good money is wasted on a bad film,2,23 October 2001,"There are two ways to look at this movie. One is a camp fest trying to be faithful to the 60's Batman. Or that Warner Brothers really missed the mark on this one. Making a movie that neither comic book fans( geeks such as myself) and causal movie fans could enjoy. Things that bother me about this movie-Posion Ivy doesn't really do anything bad. She's not a villian Batman has to stop to save Gotham. She's an annoying flirt.-George Cloony just seems to waltz through his turn as Batman. It's as if he's not even trying to get the essence of the dark knight character.
-the sets totally overwhelm the actors. Plus the guady colors schemes are annoying.-Mr. Freeze is just too jolly to be a bad guy. -too many characters suffocate the film.-the infamous bat butt shots.-this is silly to mention, but Batgirl's a redhead in the comics. (I'm a redhead so I had to mention that)-the unneccasry subplotsThe thing that really gets me is how this movie cost 100 million. I would think that Warner Brothers would have polished the script some before giving that large a sum of money. Now the 60's Batman was campy. But at the same time faithful to the typical comic book stories of the time period.

358,glaneljhonathan,7 stars because I'm guessing it's a parody or comedy at best,7,24 May 2019,"This Batman movie is definitely from one of the other infinite earths, where the plot is too convenient for each characters.Uma Thurman did a good job if only she were an animated character in a an animated Batman movie; because the way she played the role, it suits there best; she nevertheless did a good enough job, but not as her alter ego doctor self, that was too much over-acting, along with that other mad scientist in the lab. Barbara Gordon was amazing up until she finds out about the cave & the secret, at that point, the personality of both Barabara & Alfred (or his simulation, whatever) changes rather overnight! I personally did not hate Mr. Freeze or his puns entirely, they weren't that bad, the only thing killing the character was Arnold's strange accent. Coming to Bane, now that was true character assassination. He was like one of those ""Robot Chicken"" versions of Bane who only knew to say in a comic-book text style of delivery something like ""Hulk Smash"", but the choice of words being worse than that iconic line. How the hell on Earth could that physical experiment given him a brain of a new born whilst getting a body of a WWE wrestler. Thank God, Christopher Nolan at least did Bane justice later.The science fiction part of the movie, especially the ""incredible"" ideas they come up with to thaw the ice is ridiculous of course, but not more ridiculous than George Clooney smiling with a grin on his face with each & every dialogue of every emotional range, whether serious or otherwise. I think, he thought he was in a an SNL sketch of Batman Parody.I just loved this movie & enjoyed it by having a good time laughing over several times for all the wrong reasons above & more. As long as this is movie is a parody/comedy in my head, like a cheap Deadpool or something, I can justify my 7 stars which it deserves for making me laugh over the 90s campy execution of the movie. If it's not what was intended, then I don't know what to feel about this movie or what stars to give it, anyways, call me delusional! As long as it helps the movie look better!I must say, 10/10 for the inclusion of many iconic characters & cool looking suits & gadgets, both of which were a little ahead of its time.

359,Jess-24,A total piece of trash.,1,15 January 2001,"""Batman and Robin"" is maybe the worst film I've ever seen. American culture has already destroyed Superman, so why not take Batman down too?
Where do I start? Ice skates in Batman's boots? Ahh! Everything about this movie is atrocious. The plot gives me the feeling the writers put the script through a paper-shredder and handed it out to the cast. Or maybe everyone made it up as they went along. Who knows? Enough with the villain-who-fell-in-acid routine, ok? Didn't that happen to the Joker AND Two-Face? Ahh! Why doesn't this city have a police force? What in Gods name's with this guys plan? Freeze the city with my big, freezing gun? These are the kinds of stories I wrote back when I was in the 2nd grade.
No Batman movie has ever come close to the dark, dramatic imagery of the comic books, or even the animated series, but Tim Burtons attempts at least had a nice, twisted sense of style. Even ""Batman Forever""s colourful, neon wonderland was demented enough to have an excuse, but this is just ridiculous. Everyone who was involved in this movie needs to be hit in the head with a large piece of wood. The fact that movies like this are even made is tempting me to move to a communist country.

361,stefanbe,The embarrassment of the Batman legacy.,3,31 July 2008,"Never have the complexities of a slowly developing icon vanished as quickly as in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin. The Caped Crusader created by Bob Kane and whose popularity was resurrected by Tim Burton and later by Christopher Nolan, has had one major and notable setback and this film is that. Batman & Robin is nothing more than an advertisement for toys, even so far as to having one character actually explaining what her action figure will have in the box. This gigantic mess of a production is also responsible in an accomplishment that makes one question whether the word ""Batman"" should even be in the title: it's boring. If a piece of popcorn entertainment actually manages to make your eyes drowsy, despite the massive amount of colourful imagery on screen, then it is not doing its job. As an action film, Batman & Robin is a massive failure and as a comic book film, it's even worse, insulting the intelligence of the audience in the process.Already off the bat, Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) is introduced as the main villain in this piece with his plan to steal enough diamonds so as to save his beloved wife, who is suffering from a fatal disease. Down in South America, scientist Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) discovers that her boss has been using her plant-related research to create massive machine men for ruthless world leaders. In response to Isley threatening to report him to the authorities, he kills her with chemicals. However, instead she turns into the evil Poison Ivy, a plant-obsessed woman bent on a plan of world domination that's not made one-hundred percent. Not that the audience cares at this point, anyway. Meanwhile, it is up to Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) to save Gotham from being both frozen over and turn into a garden of poisonous flowers. Trusted butler Alfred (Michael Dough) is also dying and his niece (Alicia Silverstone) comes to visit and sure enough becomes Batgirl.As evidenced by the plot summary above, one of the main problems with Batman & Robin storywise is that screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is not able to balance all of those major characters enough to probably develop them. The poorly written script is particularly helped by the horribly cheesy lines that litter the production, especially with Mr Freeze whom every line seems to be a bad pun related to coldness. Goldsman also attempts to have us sympathyse with Freeze in how much he cares for his wife. Unfortunately, what could have been touching actually feels like a weak attempt at making the audience care for such an irritating character. If anybody in Batman & Robin is more annoying than Freeze, than it's the titular sidekick. All of his dialogue mostly consists of moaning about how Bruce Wayne is hogging the spotlight and stopping Robin from trying to get hold of the villains. The fact that the usually sensible Alfred takes Robin's sense makes this script even more illogical, considering Wayne's reasons for pulling Robin back are perfectly understandable.Of course, the script isn't helped much by Schumacher's poorly done direction. The fact that the opening shots of the film feature close-ups on Batman and Robin's rear-end and glued-on nipples is not a good sign of things to come. He gives so much attention to the over-stylised sets and poorly rendered special effects, that the actors are left to wollow and stand around in the background, while the stuntmen do the more ""difficult"" work. George Clooney's usual Cary Grant-like charm is lost here and the few times in the film that Wayne thinks about his parent's death, he just looks like he is thinking about what to eat for breakfast. Chris O'Donnell was passable in Batman Forever, but in this film, he is just flat and he does nothing to make us care about his character. Schwarzneggar is also un-helped by his material and everything that made him a frightening Terminator seems to have disappeared in his portrayal of Freeze. Watching his performance here, it is not surprising as to why he decided to enter politics. Michael Gough, who was rather solid in the previous films is given an elevated part here, but his performance is so hammy that we unfortunately watch as Bruce Wayne's best friend wilters away, which should not be the effect.The only actor in the whole film who actually comes out well is Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Unlike Clooney or Schwarzneggar, she understands the cartoonish feel out of the whole production and is appropriately hammy. Despite the embarrassing script she's given, she manages to make Poison Ivy a compelling and interesting villain. Every time Thurman appears on screen, the film gets considerably less painful to watch as she proves to be very entertaining. In fact, if Ivy was made the main villain and Freeze was taken out, the final result would have been much more watchable, though as proved by what was released, the film would still have been a lost cause. Nonetheless, Thurman gives an incredibly well done performance that is quite possibly the only memorable aspect of Batman & Robin. Unfortunately, despite Thurman's best efforts, even she is not enough to recommend this completely poorly done two-hour cheese-fest drivel and the bane of both Joel Schumacher's career and the entire Batman legacy.",Batman & Robin
362,General Urko,A sequel too far!,3,6 November 2001,"Batman & Robin is another awful addition to the Batman franchise. Milking the Dark Knight myth for a fourth time was a bad idea.

It is dark in that you can't actually see clearly what is going on making the fight scenes redundant. Arnie was okay & should play bad guys more often. As always Michael Gough adds a much needed sense of dignity to the film. He is truly the definitive Alfred & his small scenes are the only thing worth watching this mess of a movie for.",Batman & Robin

George Cloony isn't Batman, Val Kilmer was pretty good at it, Michael Keaton of course was the best, but George Cloony sucked and the director and the writers and the producers of Batman and Robin should NEVER be allowed to make movies again. They have reuined a great movies about Batman. Nice going dumbass.",Batman & Robin
364,danielloe,"So bad, it has to be seen to be believed",1,30 July 2015,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Batman & Robin isn't just a bad Batman movie, it's a terrible movie, a cinematic monstrosity that is so bad, you can't even offer rational criticisms that fully describe how bad this movie is. I typically start with the good things about a movie, but there are no good things in this movie. I have a very high tolerance for bad movies, and can enjoy lots of terrible movies just for how bad they are, but this movie...man, sometimes this thing is hard to sit through. So what's wrong with this movie? Well everything, but aside from that... 1) The characters and lore are completely butchered. I haven't read all that many Batman comics, but I am quite a big fan, and am well-versed in the character (reasonably so, anyway), or I thought I was, because in no Batman comics I've read or heard about, has Batman appeared at a public party. That happens in this movie, Batman and Robin are up there on stage, at a party. I mean, yeah they're waiting there to take down Mr. Freeze, but seriously, does that sound like Batman? How about Batgirl? Y'know, Barbara Gordon? Sorry, I forgot, in this movie Barbara isn't Gordon's daughter, she's Alfred's niece! Wait, what? Remember Knightfall? And Bane, one of the best Batman villains ever? Well, in this movie he will be reduced to nothing more than a hulking, mindless brute capable of only grunting a few words here and there. Why? WHY? 2) the cast. George Clooney as Batman. Who thought that would work? He's stiff, he seems bored, and I didn't buy him at all as a physical presence. Though, I'm not dis-crediting Clooney, for what he had to work with, I can't imagine anyone would care about trying to give a good performance. Arnold Schwarzenneger plays a Mr. Freeze who only speaks in one-liners. ""Chill!"" ""You're not sending me to the cooler!"" ""Allow me to break the Ice!"" I've always thought Uma Thurman's acting skills are suspect (though I haven't seen her in much), but I could've bought her as Poison Ivy in a movie like Batman Forever, but here? She's terrible! She's so over the top, and Ivy (who cares about plants and wants them to rule) tries to get Freeze to freeze Gotham! And that brings me to the biggest problem in this movie. The directing/storytelling. In my review for the Dark Knight Rises, I credited Nolan as being quite possibly the best part about that movie, as he lent the series a mature and gritty tone. Schumacher did the opposite. He made the whole thing a live action cartoon, which could never be taken seriously (even as a Saturday morning cartoon) and takes the series back to where it was before Burton helped Batman become a serious icon. Now, it was just back to being a joke. That being said, I do still enjoy this movie. Because, c'mon, where else can you get so much ridiculousness? It's a terrible movie, and if you view it as an actual movie to be taken seriously, you'll probably be appalled. If you view it as an adaptation of Batman, you will also be appalled. if you view it as a terrible movie to be laughed at, you'll probably have good time, at least for a little while.",Batman & Robin

The special effects are second to none and you have a star- studded cast. They should show this movie in to students in film school. The script is good but also hilarious. The zingers from mr freeze and all the other villains had me bent over laughing. One of the funniest parts was when batman is at an auction and when try to outbid everyone he pulls out an amex with his bat logo on it and says "" never leave the cave without it"". Oh man that was funny. The climax is great with all the ice skating ( oh sorry- spoilers!)

367,davidhutch007,Having re-watched this film,5,18 October 2005,"Here's the setup. i was working and it went quiet and i began to think of films i had seen in the cinema as a younger kid and i briefly remembered watch Batman & Robin. i remembered as a young kid loving the film, hating the poison ivy bits as she was rubbish and thinking mr. freeze was the coolest of the cool (every single pun intended).so feeling nostalgic, tonight i threw on my Batman & Robin special edition DVD to see if i loved it or hated as much as i did when i reviewed it on here some years ago.here we go.The answer is i liked it a fair bit more. we could go on all day and speak badly of Joel Shumacher, the nipples, the codpieces, the bat credit card, every single mr. freeze line but if you stop and jump back to the very early batman comics then actually this truly is a very close rendition of those comics that people pay hundreds of thousands of pounds for.I am going to defend this film and i'm not afraid of the mobbing i'll get either. George Clooney was good in small doses but he is in little of the film, more of it dominated by Schwarzenegger with the cheesy lines. However George Clooney delivers the least harsh of the Bruce Waynes and the least dark of the Batman's. if you look at Batman Forever, Val Kilmer began to add a little colour to Batman whereas here George takes it all the way to the limits and delivers a Batman we might have seen from the silver age of comics.This is called Batman & Robin so its only right we take a little look at Robin. Chris o' Donnel delivers a hammy hero and to be honest really lets the film down for me. enough said on him.Schwarzenegger. yes Arnold should be trying to buy every copy on this to have it destroyed as im sure looking back he's more than embarrassed at Warner Bros attempting to get every cheesy catchphrase in there just so fan boys could assosiate it with Batman to sell a few more toys. i suppose the script and lines were taylored for him so i guess we could expect little else for him, however whenever i think of Mr. Freeze i always think of him.Uma Thurman possibly delivers the stand out performance of the film. As i stated at the top i hated this villain as a child and its funny as you get older how you begin to appreciate new things, Uma definitely delivers here and again with very bad business between the lines. Poison Ivy really has no need to team with Mr. Freeze but she makes every moment on screen count and actually turns out to be the least campy of the bunch. now Bane is getting a re-do in cinema's soon with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight and im sure that will be a closer rendition to what his character should be. it really is a shame he's treated as just the hired help mumbling the odd ""Baaaaane"" here and ""Monnnnnkey Business"" there. total waste on Joel Shumacher's part.Speaking of Joel we should address his desires to base every building in Gotham City as a semi naked man. Gears and neon strike a real undesirable look to Gotham however for this Batman it seems to somehow mesh but in a totally different way than Batman Forver. His direction is way of key and his sense of humour (fully camp) shines through in abundance however this film does feel like a comic book from serious monets with Alfred to camp with Mr. freeze.People will always hate this film, Tim Burton purists will always believe this and its predecessor are inferiror but you could see each entry in the series as a take on a particular era of the comics, if you can look at the films like that then perhaps this film and even Forever don't add up to being the true messes that people consider them to be. I'm really glad i had time to sit down and watch this flick again and youn know what i might put it on again real soon as it would be really nice to have a Batman & Robin Saturday night again.with a beer and some popcorn this film really is a good one and from now on i wont let anyone tell me different. perhaps when i review this film again in the future it may even get a ten",Batman & Robin
368,Zombie-Kermit,"Fun for Kids, But Not For Anyone Else.",3,13 May 2008,"My greatest shame as a Batman fan is admitting that I loved this when I was 8 years old. I thought it was awesome. In fact it was this movie that made me into a huge Batman fan. So I guess all things considered.... It did one good thing.After watching this movie I started looking into other Batman stuff. After finding Batman 89 I was shocked at how much darker it was. At least now I know that's how it should be.This movie is overflowing with bad puns and bad casting choices. Most of the cast are great actors... but they just didn't work with the movie. (Although I didn't think George Clooney was awful, Uma Thurman could have been a lot worse and Michael Gough was still in it at least.) I don't think anyone really wants to see Arnie spout a dozen Ice puns a minute.I don't really blame Schumacher for this. I get the feeling he was pressured into making this into a very long toy commercial.The special effect in the movie are really not that memorable. And for many people it will be hard for them to really remember any of the action, as there is so many distractions in the movie. For example awful stuff that should never be seen such as a Batsuit with nipples, and a bat credit card.There is no real focus on character in the movie. I saw Bruce with a woman in it, and I don't even remember who the heck she was, as she had about 3 minutes of screen time. Barbara ""Wilson"" has just been thrown into the movie, it seems.I think a redeeming factor of this movie is, that if kids like it it will help them find their way to better Batman movies like 89 and Begins.... like it did for me so many years ago.4/10 Mostly for the memories.",Batman & Robin
369,Eightiesjunkie,Batman's death rattle,1,31 March 2014,"Two years after the success of Batman Forever, a new Batman film is released, and...it went over like a floating turd in a swimming pool. Why? Because this is a classic, textbook case of what happens when studios stop caring about making good films. This is precisely what happened here. Batman Forever was a huge hit, so naturally, Warner Brothers believed that making the next film even more lighthearted, would make double of what Batman Forever grossed. They also wanted the film to be more ""Toyetic"" so they could make more money by selling more toys. To begin with, Michael Gough's performance as Alfred is good as always, and in the film, we finally get a glimpse of what his and Bruce's relationship is like, also he has the best line of dialog in the film. ""There is no defeat in death, victory comes by defending what we know is right."" I also liked the setting up of Robin and Batgirl's relationship. Sadly, these were the only moments of enjoyment I received from the film. Most of the main cast members are all excellent actors, but with the exception of Michael Gough, no one gives a good performance! To be fair however, I can't put the blame on the cast. Because not even the best actors in the world could've done well with such a horrible and shoddy script. In this case, no one came out unscathed, not even director Joel Schumacher. I can't put all the blame on him either, he did what he had been paid to do. However, I CAN blame him for certain things. It was his idea to make the film an homage to the 60's Batman TV show, which was the reason why the film was so hated and poorly received by both fans and critics. No one going into this film was expecting a comedy. This may have been what the studio wanted, but it was the furthest thing that what we, the fans wanted! At the end of the day though, I have to tip my hat to Schumacher, and give him credit. Not only did he admit that the film was junk, but he also apologized for disappointing the fans, which is something I really wish other filmmakers would do. (I'm looking at you George Lucas!) As for the whole experience: am I saddened that this was the last film in the franchise? Yes. Had the film been good, would I have liked to have seen a fifth Batman movie and a possible Robin or Nightwing spin-off? Yes. In the end, whether it's films or in any other case, when money is the only concern, things will always end badly.",Batman & Robin

This is why George Clooney has replaced Kilmer in the role, with the same cast from the prior Batman/Schumacher film. To be frank, the sets, props and costumes in this movie look like a drag queen parade. Even the Bat-mobile looked exceptionally flowery. I would venture to say that this is handily the worst Batman movie ever made, closely followed by the previous Batman/Schumacher film with Kilmer in it. In addition, unlike the other Batman movies, this movie's story line gives one the distinct impression that it was made specifically for children under the age of 10. It's no wonder Schumacher wasn't asked to make another one, and thank the heavens that he didn't. It would surely have meant the death of the franchise.",Batman & Robin

What did they do to her? I mean, sure, she thinks mankind has been cruel to plant life, but has everyone been cruel to it? God, I wonder if anyone besides Goldsman revised the script. Also, at the end of the picture, Mr. Freeze is now a good guy, gives Batman two mini-test tubes full of lightening-blue liquid, that is to cure Alfred of his sickness, which by coincidence, is the same as Mr. Freezes wife! If this is so, then why didn't Freeze use the damn liquid on his wife in the first place? And that sound track is so overbearing it makes my head hurt. Plus, what's with all the gay undertones? I mean, they have these naked 100-foot statues of men holding a ball over their men nearly everywhere you go, heighways, roads, buildings, it's sicking. Not the shock value, but the fact that they'd reduce Batman into something like this. Plus, there are all these flashing close-ups of Batmans or Robins or Batgirls asses flying around every time they dress into their capes and cowls. What the hell?

379,PeterKurten911,"saved by the cast & the sets, but still a cheesy chuckle",6,12 June 2005,"This is the only Batman who came around late enough for me to go see it in theaters. Afterwards, my company cursed me straight to the inferno for having them dragged to such a brainless kid's movie. Even at the time, i couldn't blame them entirely. The Batman series had passed the revue in chronological order so i was well aware of the profound cleavage between the first two installments and the rest of the quadrilogy. The first two Batman movies marked themselves by a dark atmosphere and the importance of the Batman/Wayne duality , which, through themes as vengeance and love, provided much of the human element. From there the screenwriters and set designers injected an incredible amount of cheese instead. The villains became even more colourful, while the superhero himself lightened up his appearance with an arsenal of groovy tools and by putting nipples on his rubber suit. All of this reached its climax in ""Batman and Robin"", which pretty much explains why the greater part of humanity condemns it. The X-ray eyes of the B movie addict, however, can see the good within the bad, so here goes.the GOOD Although they defy every first principle of architecture, gravity and related laws of nature, the decors of Gotham City are a visual feast. I have a weakness for antique sculpture so giant Greek studs rising in between the skyscrapers as the background for a car chase were a treat (**). The best things about this movie relate jointly to the actors rather than their characters. Clooney is indeed the best actor in the series to portray the philanthropic Bruce Wayne ( but Micheael Keaton remains the baddest Batman on the block) & lovely Uma Thurman just can't do anything wrong as long as she gets an attitude to toy with (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). The award, however, goes to Michael Gough, whose Alfred gets his greatest role here, compatible with Desmond Llewelyn's Q in ""Licence to Kill"". We all knew they'd change the focus to a secondary character eventually, but the shift is perfectly integrated into the story, not in the least by the arrival of Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.(nice close-up on her rubber butt, by the way) the BAD Almost everything else. The action is everything but captivating. This actually goes for the consistency and pace of the movie as a whole. Surely it follows the routine of creating, deploying and defeating villains but still the whole process is no more than a string of scenes, with occasional sparks of entertainment. Did i mention the suits look ludicrous ? The whole concept behind reflecting the skies of the opposite hemisphere through the use of satellites can impossibly make sense: to make matters worse, the defrosting of Gotham ... it just won't happen. Using solar rays would a) take more than five seconds to melt the amount of use surrounding a skyscraper b) it'd either cause a giant flood or clouds of steam, both lethal to the little frozen people in the streets. But given that this movie takes it very loose with the concept of freezing and states of aggregation, leave it be. A word on the villains. The idea behind Freeze is as old as cinema, namely the scientist who's turned into an evil overlord with a noble yet personal goal by some misfortune, usually involving loved ones. To take effect this type of villain requires not only a constant display of an uneasy balance between his thirst for revenge and his humanity, but also a loved one, a cause, that the spectator gives a damn about. Freeze lacks both. Especially his spouse leaves me indifferent as she has no more to work with than a doll and some home videos. Luckily it's STILL Schwarzenegger in a kind of role he'll never reprise, with a funny one-liner (no i'm not giving it away) As long as we have Arnold, we're happy. Poison Ivy would've been great had she preserved more emotion (read: paranoia) concerning Mother Earth after her transformation, but her destructive side is too dominant, except at her very last scene. The seductive element isn't as effective as it could've been with Thurman, either.the UGLY The most obvious source of your general amazement was the observatory. The inside can host approximately hundred people and a giant space telescope weighing an equal amount of tons, minimum. Yet the whole building is shaped as a bowl in the hands of an knelled Atlas-like statue. I kept asking myself ""hmm...how are you supposed to get up there ? A connection inside the statue would take a long walk."". Furthermore the list could be endless, as distinguishing the Bad from the Ugly is hard in this movie. Freeze's suit, Freeze's minions, Freeze's transportation fridge, the doctor who transforms Bane and Ivy, the festivities at the diamond auction, the dialog between Batgirl-to-be & a holograph of Alfred (note: he sure knew her measurements when he made her a suit that ""fits her size"") ... **a special mentioning of the scale on which Gotham is build. The comparison between a human, an observatory, a statue and the surrounding building leads to the inevitable conclusion that the city reaches heights of almost a mile. Fritz Lang might like it, as there is an unmistakable echo of ""Metropolis"" in this urban fantasy.In conclusion: don't ask yourself to many questions, focus on what works and you'll make it through the Galaxy of ""Batman & Robin"". . How many times do i have to keep saying that anyway ? In the case of Batman, i'm sadly not in the position yet to write a more in-depth retrospective comment on the series as a whole. From where i stand, ""Batman begins"" goes back to the grim roots. To be continued.",Batman & Robin

381,niteman,Joel Schumacher takes the franchise from bat to worse.,1,12 February 1999,"While he was making this movie, director Joel Schumacher was quoted saying many things that struck fear into the hearts of bat-fans everywhere.  Things like ""when I think of Batman, I think extreme sports,"" and ""wait till you see the costumes -- they're practically wearing nothing,"" and ""I want to return to the roots of the old Batman television series.""  Was Schumacher seriously planning to take Tim Burton's brilliantly dark vision and reduce it to leather-clad S&M freaks spouting campy one-liners while snowboarding? Sadly, he was.Where to start?  There's so much to dislike.  George Clooney plays Batman as, well, George Clooney, the same character he's played in every appearance to date.  His Batman smirks when he should scowl, his Bruce is insufferably arrogant.  Chris O'Donnell (Robin) takes his cue from George and swaggers and preens, going from whiny brat (""I want my OWN car!"") to juvenile-in-heat in every scene.  Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze physically resembles and has all the acting talent of a 1983 Buick, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl plays up her valley-girl schtick to a ridiculous end -- ending up seeming even more clueless than she did in Clueless.  The only characters who retain any sort of dignity are Alfred, as always, and Uma Thurman's Mae West-ish Poison Ivy.The script, for I assume there was one at least at some point, is composed of the worst indulgences of Uber-Hack Akiva Goldsman .  Goldsman doesn't write dialog, he writes one-liners, as if his goal would be to have every line in the film appear on a bumper-sticker or a T-shirt.  For example, in the comic books and animated series, Mr. Freeze is a tragic character prone to long monologues about his internal suffering (Patrick Stewart was considered at one point for the role, and would have been perfect).  But Goldsman diminishes him to a role far more cartoony than the cartoon, spouting insufferable dialog like ""Everybahdy Freeze!"" and ""All right, be cool.""  Schwarzenneger, apparently, doesn't get the joke, because every single line is delivered straight, ignoring any pretense of comic delivery, bringing to mind a high-school play more than a major motion picture.  The first two films, and the third to a limited degree, explored Batman's psyche and that of his villains, asked questions about why and how the characters are how they are.  This script has all the depth and emotional subtext of an acne medication commercial.Even the props in the movie are all wrong.  The Batmobile now has no canopy, leaving the driver's head exposed (given the speed of the thing is supposedly 100 mph, it's not terribly practical).  It also looks in most scenes as if it's going about 20 mph, tops; I kept expecting a bicyclist to pass it and spoil the illusion.  In the end of the film, Batman is dressed in a silver suit -- perfect camouflage for a nocturnal creature, eh?  And, perhaps most unforgivably, Batgirl has no hood -- just an aesthetically pleasing domino mask which leaves her hair loose, all the better for the enterprising villain to grab and rip out.All of which could have been at least mitigated by some decent directing -- but alas, that was not to be.  Schumacher includes several shots from Batman Forever in this film, perhaps to tie the two together, perhaps because he's out of ideas:  Batman and Robin running towards the camera, the chest emblem, vinyl-clad buttocks, and codpiece of each character as they suit up, and the entire opening sequence are all cribbed from Batman Forever.  He also bravely defies gravity and logic, letting our heroes fall all the way from the upper atmosphere and freezing Robin in sub-zero temperatures -- all without suffering so much as a scratch.None of it makes any sense, none of it is particularly watchable -- it's not even good for camp value.  The only salvation of the franchise will be to put it back in the hands of a competent director and a scriptwriter who is capable of writing an actual script.  Until then, Bat-fans are better off watching the animated series on the WB to see what can be done with the character, in the hands of talented artists.",Batman & Robin
382,A.P.,What were they thinking???????????,1,6 January 1999,"Joel Schumacher successfully kills the Batman franchise with his second attempt.  There are so many horrible things about this movie, it's hard to know where to start.  One of the problems with this movie is the unnecessary amount of characters.  For some reason, the last two Batman movies had to have two villains.  This one had three villains, Bruce Wayne's fiancee (?), and Bat girl (???).  These characters were just thrown into the movie with no reason.  If Alicia Silverstone and Elle McPherson were taken out of the movie, there would be absoulutely NOTHING taken away from the ""plot"" (or lack thereof).  The character, Bane, also had no purpose.  Arnold was miscast as Mr. Freeze (who is a frail old man in the Batman books).  George Clooney could've been a decent Batman, but failed miserably.  The script tried unsuccessfully to take the normally dark world of the Batman movies and turn it into a comedy.  A very cheesy comedy at that.  This movie had some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard.  The supposedly ""cutting-edge"" special effects were not impressive at all.  The only good part was Uma Thurman as the sexy Poison Ivy.",Batman & Robin

385,t-hf,"How not to make a good movie in any sense of the word, for dummies",1,27 April 2014,"I don't know what compelled me to write a review for a movie that has been widely accepted as one of the worst movies ever made ever since it came out. I guess it's as good a thing to do as any when you're having your morning coffee and cigarette.This movie truly is a milestone in bad superhero movies and just movies in general. If you haven't seen it yet, see it immediately just to laugh at how atrocious it is. I couldn't begin to list the faults with this movie, but this'll give you an idea: laughable acting, atrocious dialogue, endless bad puns, poor production values, the list goes on. This is that one film where nitpicking is an unheard-of term. Everything that could go wrong with a movie goes wrong in all its glory. When it comes to plot, Mr.Freeze (played laughably by Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to freeze Gotham with the help of Poison Ivy (a misfire of a performance by Uma Thurman) who wants to cover the city in plants, an amazingly lazy evil plan that contains two elements that can't even co-exist. So it's up to Batman and Robin (the most irritating on-screen partnership in film history) to stop them.........that's it - no character development, no clever twists, just dumbassery and terrible puns all the way. Although Joel Schumacher apologised for this film years later (kudos to him), it doesn't change the fact that this film buried Batman in a pile of disappointment and criticism only to be resurrected in great fashion by Christopher Nolan years later. The main problem with this film is that it is clearly designed to sell toys. When usually toys are the bi-product of a film, this film is totally at the mercy of the toys it is meant to be selling. It's like a person being taken for a walk by their dog. The toys and merchandise have clearly made the film their servant. Not to mention the film is just cheesy and corny all the way through. I'd be wrong if I told you the film is isn't worth seeing just so you can say you sat through it, but if you know nothing about the movie: come for Batman, but stay for the laughs.",Batman & Robin
386,forecastmazy,Man they screwed this one up...,3,20 June 2003,"Okay, truth be told Schumacher isn't a bad director really. He's done some pretty decent stuff and 8mm makes up for the fact that he created Batman & Robin. BUT, however, this movie really ruined the franchise.
I think he's quoted somewhere saying ""I wanted to give the batman fans the movie they always wanted..."" What fans is that? The fans of the 1970s TV show? The fans who didn't know it was a comic book? Who???? PLEASE GOD WHO, TELL ME????I think he did it as an excuse for Alicia Silverstone to be in tights. Because shes hot and at the time she was ultra-hot. Of course... this only helped her go away. DAMNIT!And George Clooney as Batman? Who was he pleasing, the fat house wife crowd? The ER fans? No Batman fan likes this movie...We all watched it... but there was something called emotion which was missing. In this film, Batman meets Freeze and Poision Ivy, two characters who were definitly awesome in the comic book. But in this movie... well they're just a shame.This movie requires no second viewing. It only requires a first viewing because Batman Forever was fairly decent. But this? George Clooney doesn't convince me first of all that he's the disturbed avenger who is inspired by watching his parents brutually murdered in front of him. It seems like he's a snotty rich kid I'd punch if he wasn't Batman. He's cocky but not in a cool way. Not in a Batman way. He's cocky in that sort of oozing Macheesmo kinda way that 90s wrestler Razor Ramone had.Putting Robin in the movie with Batgirl all at once just seems like alot for any director to handle. Sadly Joel didn't work hard on this one. Everytime I think of this movie I flashback to the E! behind the scenes. I remember Schumacher running around saying ""They don't think we'll finish this on time...but we will!"" so he basically admitted to rushing it on camera. And I was actually excited that this would be a good movie? Wow, I was much younger back then and even as a young one I knew this movie..well... sucked.
Three stars out of ten and only three because Manos the Hands of Fate gets one. I guess worse things have been made but to ruin a comic-movie franchise? Tisk, tisk. Time may have kinda forgiven Joel but the Batman franchise atleast movie-wise is still in limbo.Let us pray that Christopher Nolan rises Batman from the ashes to be the disturbed superhero comic fans know, love, and that Tim Burton brought to us.",Batman & Robin

There just has to be room to give his film a negative number, since other horrible films that get ratings way below 5 aren't at this level, because there's no such thing as ""none more black"".As I sat through the screening in 1997, I thought that maybe I had gotten old (I was 34) and just couldn't enjoy films of this nature anymore. After the screening I overheard some teenagers talking about how pathetic and awful it was - I felt like joining in! I have since seen quite a few comic-book movies (X-Men 1+2, Spider-Man 1+2, V-Vendetta, Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Hulk, Sin City) and I guess I don't feel too ancient anymore because these all range from good to excellent films!

389,degeneraatti,A poor imitation of fun,1,28 September 2014,"Oh dear.This movie proved to me that it really is possible to roll one's eyes until they hurt. This movie also made my brain hurt, so it might just be residual pain flowing through the optic nerve.This movie might be the very last moment when someone working on material from a comic book thought that comics should always be first and foremost comical. The end result here is a mess that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.Maybe they were going for the camp appeal of the 60's Batman? Who knows, but this certainly had none of the fun. The moments where this film attempts to be funny are easily distinguished, and the viewer usually notes this with a groan or a sigh. Yes, one-liners are an important part of such comic hero action AND an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but spewing them out at such machine gun rate lessens their intended punch to utter minimum. Also, making a cartoony film with such high levels of ""threat of sex"" does make one wonder who was this film really aimed at?My main concern here is, however, that this film, that was to be the last of the series, is plagued by the same fault that had me groaning quite some during The Dark Knight Rises, another last of it's series. What brought both films toppling down for me was the decision to keep upping the ante to unrealistic heights, which leads to a moment in the film where we've gone so over the top that we can't even see the top we were supposed to go over; where tension is to be built in a fashion that resembles more a joyride in an amusement park - a cart rolling on it's set tracks - instead of the often surprising organic escalation of action; where such jumble of set-ups are in place that no conclusion can be truly satisfactory, resulting in either an anti-climatic thump or a slow sizzling out of energy, like helium leaking from a balloon.If a move away from the dark style set by Tim Burton in Batman and Batman Returns was what was wanted, there were so many things that could've been done to achieve it. In the Batman & Robin the changes undertaken were considerable, but ultimately left the movie and its' characters hollow. The only thing I felt watching this unfold was that maybe those responsible for this film didn't really care about the end result, but about all the details that went into making it: all the costumes, the settings, the gadgets, the quotable one-liners...If that really was the case, I don't think it was worth leaving the audience with nothing else than pieces of glittery surface and form- fitted leather.",Batman & Robin

Sure, there are movies that are TECHNICALLY worse, like Manos, but it's not fair to compare the two because the latter was made 30 years ago and had a budget around a dime or so. This movie COULD have been made decently but wasn't. Joel Schumacher should be killed for his crimes against humanity.

I condemn Uma Thurman for derstroying her Pulp Fiction cool with two awful, awful films (Believe me, this and The Avengers are as bad as they say. DON'T FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.) The editing is truly awful, Batgirl is brought at a totally inappropriate moment, and the final sequence is like a giant advert for the toys...which essentially it is. Coolio's cameo appearance is wasted, and the reference to A Clockwork Orange (some droogs in the background in one scene.) is truly awful, and is there for the writers to kid themselves that they are intellectual. Finally, George Clooney is obviously miscast as Batman (He looks the part, that's it), Robin has turned into an obnoxious brat and the Poison Ivy love potion is worse than Saturday morning cartoon stuff (indeed, the cartoons are vastly superior than this drivel.)

The villains are especially good, though there is some copying from ""Batman Returns"", specifically Poison Ivy - Catwoman cloning is obvious. Robin and especially Batgirl are also obviously unnecessary and look rather stupid in the context of the story. But Mr. Freeze is amazing: he really thinks and feels, only the Penguin had more soul.Batman is a bizarre character, he needs bizarre opponents. George Clooney is better Batman than Kilmer but worse than Keaton. And at last but not least the thing I really liked after ""Batman Forever"": absence of jesters screaming and laughing into your face. I'm really fed up with them in the new Star Wars. Those clowns are like a plague in every somewhat cheerful movie.Direction is weak though the end looks satisfactory. Acting is well, photography and SFX are good, especially freezing. Artistic work is weak: it's surely not Gotham, it's New York. I was shocked when saw the Statue of Liberty in ""Batman Forever"". Then it was an awful move to make the film more ""American""; ""Batman & Robin"" is returning to the fantasy groove but still it's not Gothic as ""Batman"" and especially ""Batman Returns"".Far, far not a masterpiece as ""Batman Returns"" but still rather watchable.

394,laika-lives,Joel Schumacher's condition leaves him cold to your pleas of mercy...,2,18 September 2006,"Don't let this film deceive you. In the long, forgiving periods between viewings (should you be reckless enough to watch it more than once), this film may take on an aura of kitschy fun. You may remember the gaudy production design, the naff one-liners, the over-ripe performances, and assume that this film was a so-bad-it's-good classic. I know I made that mistake. Rewatching it was a sobering experience. I'd forgotten the one quality that is the kiss of death for kitsch - dullness. This is a shockingly boring film. By the climax, I was itching for it to be over, checking the clock with disbelief that Schumacher hadn't, in fact, imposed a Kenneth-Branagh's-Hamlet running time on this leaden production.People blame camp for ruining this film, but let's be specific - this is mass camp, and bad mass camp at that. Real camp is concerned with performance, subtle double meanings, irony that doesn't force itself upon you. Tim Burton's Batman films used camp elements quite extensively, particularly in the stylised performances of his cast; Schumacher doesn't seem to be able to distinguish camp (Uma Thurman emerging from a gorilla suit, a la Marlene Dietrich) and kitsch (everything else, particularly the queasily-lit sets).I have a feeling that, with better direction, Thurman might actually have been a lot of fun as Poison Ivy; unfortunately, Schumacher can only draw out the most grotesque elements of her performance, strangling some of her more finely done comic moments (and there are few enough of those). Clooney gives the most naturalistic performance, the only star whose acting could grace a better film, but unfortunately his easy charm is all wrong for the role. At least this film seemed to act as a kick up the backside for his career; his choices after this were much cannier. Michael Gough is as solid as always.Everyone else is irredeemably awful. Alicia Silverstone and Chris O'Donnell are stuck with characters who feel like distractions; she seems shrill, he comes across as petulant. Their semi-romance is trite beyond belief. This film seriously hobbled both of their careers, which is more of a pity in the former case than the latter. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the physical presence for an imposing villain, and his make-up is actually a rare hit on the production side of things, but Mr. Freeze's dialogue defied belief even before it was put in the mouth of a comedy Austrian. As an actor, emotion isn't really Arnold's strength, so the tragic backstory of his character seems particularly misguided (although it provides one of the few memorable images in the film - the suspended body of Mrs. Fries, like a science fiction Sleeping Beauty).The film seems misguided in lots of little ways, as well. Like 'X-Men 3', there are too many characters for them all to get the attention they require. It forgets, in that 'ironic' coda with the villains, that Ivy is as much a victim as Mr. Freeze - arguably more so (like 'Death Becomes Her', there's more than a whiff of misogyny in the way it lets the man off the hook whilst condemning the woman). It uses the comic character Bane in a manner so off-handedly banal that even non-comic fans would be offended if they knew (and wouldn't Bane have made a much better central villain? Even Arnold could have played him). Elle MacPherson's girlfriend character is made to seem so superficial that it makes Bruce Wayne look bad for dating her - would the man who was so fascinated by the kinks in Selina Kyle really settle for such a glitzy trophy? Remember that it's garish, remember that it's stupid, remember that it nearly killed careers and a franchise - just remember, too, that it may be the most boring action film ever made.",Batman & Robin

The villains are colorful, the heroes are courageous, and a lot of the dislike for this film is nonsense!!!!!!!! Joel Schumacher's take is a blend of the 1940s and 1970s Batman adventures. As far as Batgirl is concerned, he did the best he could.  It is not his fault that Barbara Gordon is in a wheel chair in the comic books.

I'm glad he retired because he is a horrible actor, except for the Terminator movies. Chris O'Donnell was the only person who walked away unscathed after the failure of this movie. Uma Thurman gave the most over-the-top performance I have ever seen as Poison Ivy. Alicia Silverstone was also miscast as Batgirl, and her character was unneeded. One of the things I did like about the movie was the cinematography. I thought it was pretty cool. But the movie feels like a 2-hour commercial.

402,wwefreakjon,Batman Series Review,3,20 July 2008,"OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman & Robin.No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant ""A Beautiful Mind"". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste.Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this instalment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavour than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest instalment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series.Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler.

Schumacher had little to do with anything except yelling 'action', sure the art design was his but you'll notice that the art design in this movie is even more garish and over the top then the last one but that's because the studio was putting pressure on Schumacher to make it even more family friendly and safe then the last one, not only that but the toy company had a heavy involvement in the art design and concept art was apparently being ripped out of the artist hands so it could be sent to the factories in China. Rather then blame Schumacher I consider this movie a warning; Batman Returns was a parable on what happens when you give someone too much creative control but Batman and Robin is what happens when you have too much studio interference. This film is a mess, the production design has gone from so bright it irritates your eyes to so bright and garish that it distracts you from the film, none of the actors are taking this film seriously and so the acting is actually kinda funny (it does bring the 60s series to mind), the action is tame, the humour is bizarre, and the serious stuff they try doesn't work at all. This film is pure fluff, it's so odd that it's mesmerizing, I love every second of it, the bad puns, the garish production design, the bad acting, it all comes together to make on of the funniest films I have ever seen.",Batman & Robin

This was some of the worst tripe I have ever sat though.  The Batman franchise has gone downhill since the first installment with Michael Keaton. The original was very dark (classified as a horror movie by some), and excellent.  This movie is a glorified cartoon to boost the egoes of its stars.  Schwarzenegger (Freeze) gives an awful performance (even for him), Silverstone (Batgirl) is garbage, and don't get me started on Clooney (Batman).  The paper-thin plot was ridiculous.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is better than the stinker-to-end-all-stinkers Batman Returns, but that ain't saying much.",Batman & Robin

This isn't only the worst Batman film ever made but it would be in my top ten worst films I have ever sat down and watched. The acting is sickening and the story is terrible. The fight scenes are so cringe it makes my skin crawl with embarrassment. At one point batman takes out his Batman credit card and says 'I never leave the house without it'. At that point I was suicidal. This film is a 0/10 but I can't give it a zero!,Batman & Robin
409,maryolalov,Not cool,4,24 January 2019,"Batman and Robin is often regarded as the worst movie ever or the superhero alternative of The Room. I don't find this movie good, it is actually pretty awful but it still doesn't deserve to be called the worst.The scrip is probably one of the worst things in this movie. Filled with puns and senseless dialogues, the script makes this movie look more like a parody rather than a serious Batman movie. But to be honest I don't think that the the crew were trying to create a serious movie. All the imbecile scenes such as the one with the bat credit card just make this movie kid-friendly and more like the old Batman series with Adam West. And that makes me think that the target group for this movie aren't the Batman fans but younger kids.George Clooney was not a good Batman. He somehow managed to make the character look silly and comical. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy also seemed like a burlesque. I'm not even going to talk about Bane as this was the worst character in the whole movie. And these roles were ruined bot because the actors are bad, George Clooney and Uma Thurman are actually good actors, but because of Joel Schumacher's poor directing.Probably the only thing that I liked in this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger. His performance was as always unique and gave me a good laugh. He is the only reason why I give this movie a rating higher than 1.",Batman & Robin

Batman & Robin is twice as bad as Batman Forever was and that wasn't even top quality, so you know your in for a bad movie. The story is so bad that someone could legitimately think that it was written by children. Batman & Robin is just a high budget toy commercial and not even a good one. I have seen worse movies out there, but it is by far the worst theatrically released Batman movie if not the worst Batman movie.",Batman & Robin

412,rocky_lifter69,A franchise dies in a neon colored toy commercial,2,13 June 2010,"The first time I saw this movie, at the age of 10, I thought it was awesome. Unfortunately, reality eventually set in. This movie really was a perfect storm of studio executives wanting an even more family friendly movie and the previous movie doing as well as it did with it's lighter, more campy tone. The result is a loud, bright and bad take on the Batman.If you know anything about comic books, the plot is easy enough to understand. Mr. Freeze needs money to save his ill wife and plans to freeze Gotham City and hold it ransom in order to get it. Poison Ivy wants to kill all humans and overrun the world with her super plants. Only Batman and Robin can stop them! And along the way, Alfred the butler has a niece show up and then falls ill. Of course, Batman and Robin have a spat over Ivy and Alfred's niece becomes Batgirl. In the end, good triumphs over evil and Freeze even helps cure Alfred, who had and early stage of the same disease his wife does.There are so many bad things about this movie that I feel the need to list them. So here goes: Mr. Freeze only speaks in ice and cold related puns, which wears thin after about five minutes; Batman and Robin have nipples on their suits. We don't know why; Poison Ivy comes off as a murderous Jessica Rabbit, thanks to Uma Thurman's ""performance""; Gotham City has become some kind of neon nightmare with giant statues of muscular men scattered about; Alicia Silverstone, as Batgirl, is terrible. On top of that, they completely botched the origin of her character; Batman has a Bat-American Express card; Batman comes off as possible being in the closet (George Clooney later admitted he played the character as being gay); Right before the final battle, Batman, Robin and Batgirl rush off, as time is short. Yet they still take time to change into entirely new suits and get new vehicles while Freeze starts to ice the city; there are so many big flashy vehicles that it feels much like a toy commercial; in an early sequence, Batman and Robin sky surf; in another early sequence, Batman and Robin somehow have ice skates that appear from the bottom of their boots; Bane, a brilliant criminal mastermind in the comics, is reduced to a giant oaf who works as Poison Ivy's thug; I don't feel the need to go on.Despite the lashing I just gave this movie, you may have noticed I gave it a 2. The reason this did not get the lowest possible score is that it's epic failure was enough to cause an eventual reboot of the franchise, which in turn became two of the best comic book movies ever. For that reason, it gets a full point more than it would have on merit alone. The best thing to do with this movie is to view it right before watching Batman Begins and/or The Dark Knight, as it's pitiful existence makes those films seem even better than they already are.",Batman & Robin
413,Raskolnikov,Mindless fun,10,23 January 1999,"I really quite enjoyed this movie.  Its completely over-the-top bravado impressed me.  Be warned though, if you take Batman seriously then you shouldn't watch.  But for the majority of us, the non-anally retentive people, then this movie is a lot of fun and well worth a rental.The villains were very cool in this one, and we had FOUR!!  Arnie got better as the film went on.  He was a real hoot.  Uma was totally over-the-top and crazy as Poison Ivy.  She was funny and extremely hot!  There was also Bane as Ivy's sidekick who was funny whenever he appeared even though (and probably because) nothing he said ever made any sense!  Then there was Bane's creator, Dr Woodrue played by John Glover with probably the best performance of the film.  I wish he could have been in more of it.The heroes weren't so flash though.  Alicia Silverstone was spunky as Batgirl but the title characters, Batman and Robin as played by Clooney and O'Donnell were pretty lame.  Batman was made to say too many corny one-liners.  This should have been left to the villains, it suits them.  It definitely didn't suit Batman.  Robin was just flat out annoying.  Michael Gough as Alfred actually gives quite a good dramatic performance in amongst all the campiness, I'm not sure why he bothered.The SFX were great.  The weren't at all realistic which was the way it was intended to be you fools!  The whole film is dazzling on the eyes, whether it be the sets or the aray of good looking actors and actresses.  Too put together a film of this large of a scale is quite an achievement.  Anyone who says that Schumacher isn't a good director, doesn't know anything about directing films.This is definitely one of the best no-brainer films of recent years.  To all you people who are pining for the miserable Burton Batmans, get stuffed. Burton made his two movies, if you like them so much, then go and watch THEM.  Schumacher has now made his two films to appeal to a different audience.  Now it's probably time to see what someone else will do with the franschise.  I can't wait.8/10 - Terrific fun.",Batman & Robin
414,existenz-6,terrible terrible terrible,1,10 October 2000,"This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is clearly one of the worst big budget movies ever.  Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Bad acting, horrendous script by Akiva Goldsman of ""Lost in Space"" fame.  This one is right up there with Speed 2 and Spawn, all from the same year of 1997.",Batman & Robin
415,andrfenlon,startlingly fantastic,1,7 October 2001,"It seemed like quite a feat to produce a Batman movie that could top Batman Forever, but Schumacher and the gang did it with much aplomb.  A visual and emotional tour-de-force, Batman and Robin is easily the finest comic-genre film ever created.  Clooney proves himself the best Batman by far by giving a surprisingly realistic performance.  He seems to have captured the Bruce Wayne demeanor, cultivated it, packaged it and shipped it out to the comic-book-loving American audience so that we can all relish and treasure it.  He is a very gifted man, as he proved to us in ER, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and From Dusk Till Dawn, and as he proves once again here in this film.      Thurman is genuinely creepy (and oh so undeniably seductive and sexy!) as Poison Ivy.  She brings life to an otherwise mundane role.  The seductive dance she performs in a gorilla costume stands as my favorite part of the movie.  Never before had I been so attracted to a gorilla!! Chris O'Donnell puts an interesting psychological tone to the movie playing Robin as a complex and enigmatic character.  In the movie, unlike the comic, Robin is insecure, yet confident, mature, yet adolescent, and attractive, yet togged in garish garb.  Holistically, O'Donnell's Robin is a walking paradox. In this movie, Robin is so uncannily complex that it brings to mind the question: ""could Kafka or Faulkner have done a better job than Akiva Goldsman and Joel Schumacher?"" Perhaps not.      And, lest we forget, Arnold's Schwartzenegger's performance in this masterpiece was nothing less than spellbinding.  As Nobel prize laureate and two-time Olympic decathloner Victor Freeze, Schwartzenegger finally proves that he can really act.  Not only is Schwartzenegger uproariously funny and convincingly terrifying, he plays Mr. Freeze as an obviously ingenious, yet tortured man.  We, as an audience, can commiserate with Freeze easily; he is a very strong-willed person, yet he must live his life with obvious physical handicaps (the necessity for cold) and the desperate need for love. Breathtaking Arnold, breathtaking.      Aside from the acting, the movie has an undeniably engaging plot, and what an ingenious script!  This, in a sense, is a Hitchcockian mystery, a classic cult teenage angst film, a heart-wrenching drama, an edge-of-your seat action-suspense film, and a subtly brilliant comedy all rolled into one!  Who would expect such an interesting and eclectic mix of styles and genres to be a Batman movie?! More importantly, who would expect a Batman movie to be so captivating, to have such frightening villains and likeable heroes and to be so downright funny! Hahahahahaha!  Oh God, I wish more movies like this would come out of Hollywood!!",Batman & Robin
416,CTS-1,Who Green-Lighted this disaster?,1,25 December 2002,"I saw this movie in a second-run theater at a resort with its own brewpub. This was important, as I was allowed to: A.  bring in beer with me to the theater; B. buy more beer as the movie became more painful; and C. since I only paid $1.50 for admission (really about $5.00 too much- and yes, I understand the math), I could spend the money I would have spent on a first-run ticket on the aforementioned beer.  I have the utmost sympathy for those who sat through this film without such mental shielding.At this date, it is obvious that this film killed a previously profitable franchise.  It managed to have the cheesiness of the Adam West TV series, but yet lacked any of the humor which made the TV show watchable.  What wa s left was a poor mish-mash:  were Uma Thurman and Ah-nold supposed to be humorous villains?  Genuinely evil villains?  Misguided anti-heroes?  Can anyone tell, or does anyone care after 45 minutes?  This was the first movie to show that putting Uma Thurman in kinky outfits cannot salvage a mess of a film (yet, it was tried again- see ""The Avengers"").  Give me Julie Newmar anyday, instead...As a dark film, this film fails.  As special effects brain-candy, this film fails.  As camp, this film fails.  As an attempt to develop any characters, this film fails.  This may very well be the least cost-effective film ever, in terms of the amount spent to make a useless pile of ____.  A few suggestions as to how this ""film""'s budget would have been better spent:1.  Endow a film school.  Enroll Joel Schumaker.2.  A retirement annuity for Michael Gough.  Really, he has been a great actor, and should not have to spend his older years appearing in this sort of embarrassment.3.  Give the money to Peter Jackson and tell him to do something, anything, with it.  Definitely bound to get a better film, or more likely, two or three better films.4.  Give the money to any random person on the street and tell them to make a film with it.  Highly probable to get a better film, or more likely, two or three better films.5.  Endow an MBA program.  Enroll whoever green-lighted this.6.  Therapy for the people who thought this film was a good idea.",Batman & Robin
417,VenomX,Was this movie cursed?,3,30 August 2002,"After watching Batman & Robin for the first time in years, I'm a little disturbed as to how bad this movie was.  It was like Schumacher took the corniness of Adam West's Batman, and then tried to make it an integral part of the Batman theme.  The only problem was that in the case of West's version, nobody took it seriously; it was more of a spoof of Batman that was around just for a cheap laugh.  I really don't know what possibly went wrong in production that could create a movie this terrible.The biggest problem, and one that repeats along with every single unneeded one-liner is the acting.  I have tremendous respect for Arnold Schwarzenegger and still feel he is the best action hero Hollywood ever produced, but in this movie he performs as badly as he did in his early films.  The best part of Arnie's action movies were his one-liners, they were only said at certain moments in the films at the right time, which made them OK to enjoy and laugh at.  To have him yell out puns about his villain gimmick kills that little enjoyment.  Other actors that nearly saw their careers, which they spent years building up, are Clooney & Thurman. George Clooney makes a horrible Batman and Thurman's even worse as Poison Ivy. Other actors that didn't really have much of a career before this disaster were O'Donnell & Silverstone; Robin spends way too much time whining and complaining while Alicia Silverstone couldn't act if her very existence depended on it.The direction is also just as wretched; highways towering over high-rise buildings, neon lights being blasted onto every single skyscraper in town, observatories being held on statues, folks, I can only stretch my imagination so far, OK? Gotham must have one hell of an electric bill to keep those neon lights going all night long.  The action scenes are just as cheesy; Freeze driving his vehicle onto the arm of a statue and jumping off the end back onto the freeway? Come on, plus the fight scenes are akin to what I would expect from Looney Tunes (characters throwing people 20-feet into the air?).Other glaring errors only point towards this movie's soul purpose to bring more merchandising dollars to the studio.  Like when Batman, Robin & Batgirl race to the observatory in a Bat-glider, Bat-hovercraft and a Bat-cycle (I made those names up based on what I saw), I honestly thought the only reason they introduced those vehicles was to license some more toys to sell.Surely B&R did something good, right?  They did develop Alfred a little better (I always felt he was the most underrated of all the Bat films) and show his relationship to Bruce Wayne, albeit very poorly.  I guess it's the thought that counts and the fact that they chose to include that little development was welcome.Burton had a good idea with the first two Batmans; nice, dark, gothic, with strong characters and well-developed villains.  Batman Forever hovered above the level that B&R resides on by providing some decent acting and the fact that Burton was on the crew (as producer).  This movie tramples on all that, and was clearly produced to just cash in on the Batman name.  This movie should serve as a powerful lesson of what can happen when franchises go bad.3/10",Batman & Robin

Whoever approved the script should have looked at the first five pages and realized that the movie would be doomed. A cause for a rewrite should of been ordered then. But somehow it got the green light. Akiva Goldsman was obviously under the influence of some type of narcotic when he wrote this. It's awful. It must of taken a total of 3 minutes to write. There's absolutely nothing to like about this movie. The only part I liked is when the credits rolled and I realized I didn't have to withstand this nightmare anymore. It might not be so hard if there was something I liked about it. But this movie is an abomination in all aspects. How do you go from the classic Batman (1989) to this trash? I don't understand it. It's so bad that you begin to become upset because you realize this is two precious hours of your life that you can never get back. Arnold's one liners are beyond annoying and stupid. ""Let's Kick Some Ice"". What is going on? And there's endless one liners as pointless as this throughout the entire movie.

The fourth of the Batman series, it forces Batman and Robin to overcome their animosity towards each other and defeat the duo Mr.Freeze/Poison Ivy. Oh cripes! Where the heck should I begin? First off, George Clooney is NOT an action hero. He did a bad enough job with From Dusk till Dawn and the Peacemaker, and no thanks to the really lame script, it makes him look even more pitiful. I could understand when rumors surfaced that Clooney would not like to do another Batman flick. Second, out of all of the major characters, Chris O'Donnell did a really poor job acting the already pitiful script. ""Naaah!!! You're just mad because she wants to kiss me and not you!"" Gimme a break. Third, did Joel Schumacher ever consider taking this movie seriously? What did he do? Toss in a whole bunch of different characters and tell'em to go figure out how to act them out themselves? This movie is really bad, and I would not suggest it to anyone unless you are completely bored out of your mind. I'm hoping the next Batman movie fairs better (They have to, I don't think they are satisfied with the complete disappointment of this movie).

The actors must have been embarrassed beyond belief!  Everyone (aside from the actor who plays ""Alfred"") seemed to be mis-cast.

His acting has never been something to applaud, plus he was given very VERY few lines at all throughout the movie, and YES... most were ice puns.Let me just tell you, I had no idea how many puns you could say that refer to ice until I watched this movie.  They're giving Arnold lines that are too close to the kind Jim Carrey (The Riddler in Batman Forever) would say. Arnold is NOT a comedian and can NOT say these lines so that they're funny. His character is one-hundred and twenty one times different than that of The Riddler.  PLUS, all he does is destroy things, freeze things, and say stupid.. *ahem... STUPID puns.

Val Kilmer did a faithful job as Batman in Batman Forever, but Michael Keaton is always to be known as the best.In short, they put the wrong bad guys in the film (although Mr. Freeze had a lot of potential, they screwed the character up) and Poison Ivy has never been a very popular or interesting character.

Uma Thurman? Her biggest, most exposed roles since were the Kill Bills- more Tarntino hype than Uma-hype- and My Super Ex-girlfriend, a stinker in its own right- before Batman and Robin, she had a pretty good career going. Chris O'Donnell? A promising career ruined as the irritating Robin, a character so annoying you constantly hope he is somehow horribly slain during the film. Before this, O'Donnell was big time.

So, that's 3 careers down the drain. Arnie? Well, sure, he's now the governator, but aside of T3, did any of his movies fare well after he put in this horrific performance as Mr. Freeze? Think about after '97 for the big guy: no hits other than T3. Not a lot of roles offered to him, period. And any of the movies he was in bombed. So that's 4. Elle MacPherson?

429,EricVierthaler92,"Where is Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, and Danny Elfman when you really need them the most?",1,8 July 2009,"Wow first of all I can't believe I used to like this movie but I was a young child and I loved all that campy/unrealistic movies! This movie was god awful! When I was younger I would watch this movie like everyday! I loved the bat mobile because I thought it looked awesome, and i loved all those dump gadgets they had. But looking back now 10 years later the bat mobile and everything looked very cheesy. When I was younger I remember I always wanted to have the toys they made out of this movie. Years later I look back and I say to my self 'Wow I actually used to like this crap lol'. It does ruin or should I say destroy the dark thing Tim Burton did for the 89' and the 92' movies. And the hole ice skating scene with Batman and Robin playing against the bad guys was just plain stupid and ridiculous. And another thing I never got when the bat mobile froze how the hell did it back to the bat cave and not frozen? Or maybe Batman used one of his cheesy gadgets to get it back to the bat cave lol. Casting Arnold as Mr. Freeze was not the best choice they could've'e got somebody for qualified for the role, but Arnold is a good actor and very talented man but he was never meant to be Mr. Freeze. And why did Joel felt like he needed to put nipples on the bat suit and have scenes where Batman is putting on his suit and show his butt? That disturbed me. George Clooney made the big mistake by choosing to take away the obsession that Batman has with the death of his parents. That would've saved this movie if they at least mentioned it. But George felt like that 'it is time for Batman to grow up now.' but you see George that is what made Bruce Wayne become Batman and what made him so dark. That's what this movie really needed it desperately needed Bruce's parents death mentioned and it needed to be more dark. This movie took it away his darkness and turned it into a kiddy campy unrealistic movie. George Clooney sure had the Batman voice when he put on the Batman suite but he wasn't that great of a Batman. This movie had the worst dialog that I have ever heard in a movie. I mean come on, ""This is why Superman works alone."" wow Batman mentioned Superman yes I'm serious I'm dead serious! Val Kilmer and Michael Keaton were much better. The third movie 'Batman Forever' actually felt like a movie and was actually entertaining. But this movie felt like it was a toy commercial for toys r' us. No this movie felt like a big peace of turd taken on a big pile of puke and with finger nails put in also. In fact I think this is the only reason why they made this movie just so they could make big money on toys from the movie. And I hated bat girl she was annoying and I just didn't like the character, in fact I never did like bat girl. Poison Ivy has the be the most unrealistic villain ever. Her origin scene was so cheesy that a snail can make a better origin scene. I mean come on. Dying from a kiss??!! The last time I saw this movie it was so bad I just turned off the TV. This feels more like the campy 1960's version of Batman then the dark version we all love. Mr. Freeze was cheesy. I mean I felt bad for his wife and I can understand why he's Mr. Freeze but they could've done his character better with out all of his scenes being cheesy lines such as from the movie, ""Let's go kick some ice."" and ""How did the Dinosaurs die? The ice age!"" um actually the Dinosaurs didn't die from the ice age you idiot. When I was younger I would've gave this movie a 5 out of 5 but now as I grew up and matured I give this movie a 1 out of 5. It's the worst Batman movie ever made.

430,kilgore2345,Comic Book Hero Choreographed by Busby Berkeley,3,12 August 2005,"Not much to say about Batman and Robin that has not already been said. Entire film is miscast, except the reoccurring actors that portray Alfred and Commissioner Gordon. Even if you like puns, the screenplay is full of clichés and pages of Deus ex machinas. The budget was huge on this film, but the effects are quite cheesy and at times on par with something found in an Ed Woods production. Do not expect this to be a dark film that delves into anything. Rather, Schumacher turns Tim Burton's Batman into Adam West. For some people, the Adam West Batman was fun and does just fine. Yet, there is a problem with portraying Batman in this light in these films. The Batman films beginning with Batman (1989) wanted to do away with the campy element; they were driving at a new hero with problems and issues. This film attempts to try to show this aspect in some scenes, but it is not very close. Those scenes are only playing lip service to the franchise that made such an impact on fans and critics. Instead, plenty of Batman purists were duped. The film is not the worst, but instead it stirs resentment in thousands of people because they so hoped to have one thing and then were handed the opposite, and, of course, no refund was given.",Batman & Robin
431,DangerAwesome,I hope you enjoy train wrecks,2,7 November 2013,"""Batman & Robin"" is the answer to the question, ""what would happen if the worst script in the history of Hollywood TV had every character miscast and then was executed with a medium to low level of competency?"" I genuinely got the feeling that the movie was written by a 5 year old playing with action figures and Joel Schumacher decided to make the same thing but with real people.There isn't one good acting performance in the whole thing. You can simply distinguish the awful to the miscast to the not awful but mediocre. In the awful there is Alicia Silverstone, in miscast there is George Clooney and Uma Thurman. Arnold Schwarzenegger manages to be both miscast and awful, though his dialogue is mostly to blame. Then Chris O'Donnell, Robin, is the only one who you could argue didn't suck. And his performance is undermined by bat nipples that make you laugh at nearly everything he does.The dialogue attempts to be witty but it's simply cheesy. Everything Mr. Freeze says in the entire movie is a bad pun. Then there are literally dozens of puns littered elsewhere throughout the movie. Robin: ""So this is where you've been hanging out."" As he and Siverstone hang off a bridge. Mr. Freeze: ""You're not sending me to the cooler."" Mr. Freeze: ""What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age."" He says as he freezes the museum dinosaur Batman surfed down the neck of. Mr. Freeze: ""Cool party."" Mr. Freeze: ""Allow me to break the ice."" Mr. Freeze ""The Ice Man cometh!"" Batman: ""Hey, Freeze. The heat is on.""The only plus for this movie is it contains one of the worst lines in cinema history, which is hilarious. Robin: ""I hate to disappoint you but my rubber lips are immune to your charms."" *tears fake lips off* I could watch that clip on a loop for a day straight.Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to dissect everything wrong with it. It has little other value.",Batman & Robin
432,Chronus,FatMan and Producers,4,13 June 2001,"However I look at this movie, I cannot find anything positive about it. Clooney as Batman? So many have said it, and here it goes again: how worst a choice could they have made?Schwarzenneger and Uma Thurman carried the movie in their shoulders, and even they could do nothing to prevent the complete sinking of a movie belonging to a series that owed much to fans, those faithful ones that want to see anything related to the Bat.Clooney, O'Donnel, Silverstone...What a nightmare of choices!The story is ridiculous, the directing is laughable... We are used to it: these producers THINK they have a formula for success and they suck-it-to-the-bone (no pun intended). The thing is, if you don't have a story for a movie, why make it? Even ID4, Armageddon, Starship Troopers had some sort of a story behind them, but this...this...trash is so horribly weak on plot (assuming we can say that THERE IS A story!) that...why bother say more?Well, just this: mr. Schumacher did a few movies that were fine pieces of entertainment, works such as A  Time to Kill, The Client, Batman Forever, and the good Flatliners. Why, oh why, I ask, did he get himself involved with the trash and the can that someone decided to call Batman and Robin? This movie completely obliterates the elements that Tim Burton and Michael Keaton decided to bring on to the Batman movie series. There is no mistery, no secrecy, no realistic heroism, no action a la Comic book, no story, no consistency, no pace, no care for the characters (ever seen anything as shallow as these characters??)...The producers surely make a few considerations regarding the IQ level of todays movie audiences and they thought they could get away with clichés and bad taste...Er...hummm, well, is this their fault or ours? We may think like this: would mr. Keaton, miss Basinger, mr. Val Kilmer and Jack Nicholson ever agree on giving their faces for this movie? Why did Schwarzennegger and Thurman put their signature on the contracts for this movie? Well, there are movies and dollars...Who cares, as long as these ($$$) keep on coming? Better this trash than making comercials for soaps and drinks...Well. Not well, real bad, a bad nightmare, a ridiculous usage for special effects and big bucks.Don't see it.

All Warner Bros had to do was hire Joss Whedon and Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) to write and direct the movie and it would have been tight.  The way the studio pairs up villians doesnt seem to make sense.  Poison Ivy (portrayed by Angelina Jolie) and The Scarecrow (John Malkovich) would have been incredible together.  Batgirl was Commissioner Gordons daughter not Alfreds damn neice!!  Batgirl could only have been protrayed accurately by Ashley Judd (perfect age, body type, and personality).  George Clooney would bave been great as Batman in the Whedon/Sena film but was painfully awful and boring in the Schumacher version.

How movie is critically awful, its box office gross may tell otherwise. 237 millions in globe compared to 125 million budget. Not every movie can do that. Anyway...I watched this film 2-3 times as a kid and it leaved solid impression on me. Now, I'm 23 and I watched it few days ago, now I understand why critics chopped this version of Batman in half. Schwarzenegger(one of my favorite actors)did his work below average. Still, the dull script poorly developed his characters. It lack some depth. Similar thing with the others. George Clooney-totally wrong choice for the main role. Other actors fit somewhere between them two. Plot is overtly and unnecessary complicated and bleak. Considering who's the writer(Akiva Goldsman)script could be better. Joel Schumacher approach is similar to his previous Batman film called ""Forever"". Even the opening sequence are the same in both films(Batman prepares for the night). Elliott Goldenthal did marvelous job writing the score, although same as it is in ""Forever"". Fits with film's dark, grim atmosphere. I couldn't compare it with Danny Elfman's music because it would not be fair since they two wrote equally the same thing, each on their way. Sets are built okay and the effects are nice. But, I must admit that action sequences look a bit childish. Speaking of childish, thing what definitely ruined the potential hit is its ""toyetic"" approach as Schumacher described in commentary. I'm pretty sure that everybody will know what it means so I'll move to conclusion.""Batman & Robin could be watchable feature anyway.

438,hanifmuhammad92,The worst movie ever created!,1,26 August 2012,This movie is an abomination that should never be made again. Every cast member is horrible in this film. George Clooney is the worst Batman by along shot and Arnold is unbearable as Mr.Freeze. Uma Thurman is a great actress but you could never know that by watching her try to act like Poisen Ivy. The Plot is laughable and to merely quote the cheesy dialogue causes me physical pain. I can get over stupid bat nipples what I can't get over is horrible dialogue and a a plot so shallow it would embarrass the worst Saturday morning cartoon.

439,J5iftY5iveXtreme,My favorite guilty pleasure film!,5,4 July 2009,"Joel Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin"" -- the bane of Batman (and movie-going) fans everywhere. Lambasted upon its released, it is undoubtedly the worst Batman movie ever made and is widely considered to be one of the worst films in the comic-book/superhero genre and one of the worst films ever.This is probably true. Objectively speaking, this is quite a silly film. I used to really love this as a kid (and this is perhaps best for *really* audiences), but now I see what it is.Behold now the wonders of this film: *Batman and Robin playing ice-hockey with Mr. Freeze's thugs, complete with ice skates (!) that pop out of their shoes -- talk about being prepared!*Batman and Robin surfing (!!) out of Freeze's phallic-shaped rocket ship in a scene that defies every law of physics and gravity. *Not only do the Batman and Robin suits come complete with rubber nipples, but there are (unnecessary) shots of the heroes' buttocks and other private areas!*And who can forget Arnold Schwarzenegger's (spelling?) *really terrific* performance as the tormented Victor Fries, a.k.a. the villainous Mr. Freeze? He's supposed to be cold and cruel, and yet he seems to be having a ball throughout this movie, with all his countless ice/snow/winter/cold jokes, puns, one-liners, etc.Adding to all this are the (melo)dramatic story lines of the movie: Alfred dying of a (totally fictional) illness and Batman and Robin's relationship in trouble because of their quarrels. Too bad the rest of this movie's silly. At least the Adam West was entirely goofy. It would've made more sense if the filmmakers made this film a complete comedy, but it's not.And George Clooney is widely considered to be the worst Batman actor ever. This may be true. He's hard to take seriously at the Dark Knight. His Batman is laid-back and casual -- spouting some really cheesy one-liners and quips. Not only does he look ridiculous in the Bat-suit, he doesn't seem to be trying at all.This movie is loud, it's over-the-top, it's bombastic, and it insults viewers' intelligence. The costumes and gadgets and gaudy and meant to sell toys, and there's a homoerotic undertone in this movie. Schumacher has a strange vision of Gotham -- neon lights, colossal statues of naked, muscular men, and the streets are littered with ridiculous neon gangs.But is all this necessarily a bad thing?Even if this is a bad film, I just couldn't bring myself to hate it. I saw it recently, and I still couldn't hate it. Truth is, I personally ENJOYED this movie! I loved Mr. Freeze's cheesy lines. I can both laugh at (and laugh with) him. In fact, today, I laugh at and laugh with this film! Strangely enough, this movie is enjoyable in a really weird way. Today, this remains to be my favorite guilty pleasure film. It's for that reason that I gave this film a five out of ten and not a one.In short, if you are with friends and you're all bored, and you're all in the mood for messing around, it might be the perfect choice to watch this film -- you'll be laughing (and groaning).",Batman & Robin
440,TG22Film,Considered the worst Batman film.....with reason,4,1 February 2020,"So I saw this at the cinema aged 12. I don't remember much of the experience, and perhaps there was a reason for that. I think what I did remember was Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy - and I actually thought although this is not her best film(!) she was one of the few highlights with her comical/glam style of portraying the Poison Ivy character.I just think this film was clearly not going for anything remotely serious, and if you treat it as a harmless funfare of daft gags - it may not be as terrible as it seems (arguable). I actually think this would have been a lot better as a 'batman and robin spoof' with better comedy written in the script. Instead it's mostly bad comedy with the odd mildly funny 'tut' reactions to puns here and there. The film is also way too long for its extremely simple plot and characters. No more than 90 mins, or even 60 mins was really needed.So not one to watch if you have literally anything productive or slightly more interesting to do of an evening. But, if you want to cringe relentlessly, give it a go. Or if you secretly liked Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (I confess)",Batman & Robin
441,namideo,Director foils Batman's efforts to save Gotham City...once again.,4,21 August 2008,"I gave this film a 4/10 (as you can see) and I'm sure many would be surprised that I rated it that high. The truth is, I'm a sucker for Batman movies. I doubt I'll ever buy this movie, but I do tend to watch it when it comes on TV now and then.I loath the old 60s television series, but I'm aware that it had a strong following, and like it or not, it has left a mark on the history of this franchise. So, I can sort of respect this film's attempt at reverting back to those good ol' days. The only problem is, it also tries to follow the Tim Burton films to a small extent, and the combination isn't a healthy one. We have a surreal, colorful world of pure childlike imagination combined with the adage of Bruce Wayne's more human inner conflicted self and villains with rather violent tendencies, and as a result, it feels like the movie can't decide which direction it wants to go in.Honestly, I think the worst part about this movie was the direction. The script itself isn't all bad. If the style had simply been altered and a few decisions changed, would have radically made a difference, in my mind. The villains are actually more or less faithful to the comics as well as the animated series that was also popular at the time. As opposed to Batman Forever, in which Riddler and Two-Face bare little resemblance to their comic book counterparts, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze are much more true to their characters.George Clooney is an appealing actor to watch on screen. As Bruce Wayne, he's okay, and perhaps the best scenes in the movie are with him and Michael Gough, as Alfred. Here we get something a bit more genuine and a break from the outrageous world that surrounds this film. As Batman, he's not quite as convincing, and plays the character more for laughs rather than the harsh, serious tone of Michael Keaton or Christian Bale. Still, his style works at times, I guess in the same way that Adam West's did for him.What tends to kill this movie is that so many aspects about it are unjustifiably over-the-top. Why does Batman need a silver costume with nipples? Why does the batmobile have to glow in the dark? Why does their need to be a ""witty"" line delivered every 5 minutes? All in all, I can't say that this is a must for Batman fans. Again, the lack of direction tends to hurt this movie more than anything. If not for the violence inherited from the Burton films, this movie could've at least had an appeal to little kids, much like the 60s television show. Instead, it doesn't appeal to either age group, older or younger. It's just a mixed bag.",Batman & Robin

The same cannotbe said of either Poison Ivy or Bane.  Arnold did as good as he couldwith his role, as did Uma Thurman and Jeep Swenson, but they weren'tgiven the material they needed to accomplish the tasks.I wasn't impressed with the selection of George Clooney as Batman, but Iwasn't disappointed with his portrayal of the role, he did good.  I willsay the same thing about Chris O'Donnell in his reprisal as Robin, and Ithought Alicia Silverstone was the perfect person to cast as Batgirl. Why didn't they stay with the comic books for her character?I felt great disappointment in seeing Thurman and Silverstone completelywasted in their roles.  They really weren't allowed to do much ofanything except look pretty.  I've seen Thurman in other films, and sheshows she can be both intelligent and witty, and Silverstone can also beas well.  Why didn't they give these brilliant women more to do?Batman & Robin had a dismal 'I feel your pain' theme, and was done in atime when such themes were popular, but overdone.

446,Nephalim,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever,1,24 February 2004,"Don't get me wrong, the old Adam West Batman TV show was certainly funny, and given the times, a more accurate representation of what Batman was trying to be wouldn't have succeeded nearly as well. But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.In Batman & Robin, Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny, this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here, seeing as it's NOT funny, it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies, and, arguably, the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space, Gigli, and You Got Served.George Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes, but this suave, dashing, and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.There's Chris O'Donnell, the angst-ridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.Alicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say, ""Hmm, who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone!"" No offense to Alicia, but she's out in right field on this one. Her tough-girl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside, she actually does very little.Now, onto the villains. Uma Thurman, who we know CAN act, is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First, when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela, she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan, by the way, would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.Arnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean, of all the Batman villains I could see him playing - Bane, for christ's sake - Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless, calculated, and cold (no pun intended) sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.And then, all that aside, they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says ""chill out."" Of all the ways it sounds, menacing is not among them.Seriously, I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman, and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then, this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead, it borders on a travesty of good cinema. I only wish that 0 stars was a selectable option at the imdb, for this film ALONE.",Batman & Robin
447,michaelmunkvold,Nipples on the Batsuit. 'Nuff said.,1,17 April 2015,"Some movies are so bad they're good. ""Batman & Robin"" is so bad it inspires awe.It's a disaster of mythic proportions, a film so bad that it killed a multimillion dollar franchise for nearly a decade. I challenge you to find a movie with worse acting, a more ridiculous plot, and cheesier dialog. It's big, loud and stupid in all the wrong ways. When directors of bad movies want to feel better about themselves, they say, ""At least I didn't put nipples on the Batsuit.""The plot, such as it is, is beside the point, but here goes: Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) fight Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and Bane (Robert Swenson), who want to turn Gotham City into a giant polar ice cap for some reason. Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying of a Movie Disease that Mr. Freeze conveniently has a cure for. Alfred's niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone, far too young to be an octogenarian's niece) moves into Wayne Manor and becomes Batgirl because... oh, why not? And did I mention that the Batsuit has nipples on it? Honest-to-God nipples!This is a low point for all concerned. I didn't care for Joel Schumacher's first entry into the franchise, ""Batman Forever"", but there he at least had some fun making a big, silly comic book movie. There is no creative joy in ""Batman & Robin"". With every badly choreographed fight scene and inexplicable close-up of Batman's leather-clad ass, you can feel Schumacher throwing up his hands in frustration as he loses all control of the thing.The actors fare worse. Clooney looks embarrassed and bored. Schwarzenegger's performance consists of a seemingly never-ending series of ice- related puns (""Chill!"", ""Let's kick some ice!"" and, my personal favorite, ""You're not sending me to the cooler!""). Thurman plays a good vamp, but there's only so much she can do with lines like ""My vines have a crush on you!"". You can almost pinpoint the second that O'Donnell and Silverstone realize that they've ruined their careers. Swenson flexes his biceps and growls. A lot. Yes, ""Batman & Robin"" is a terrible movie. And yet... I can't look away. Every time I see it on TV, I am helpless in the grip of a perverse compulsion to watch the thing. I know there are better movies on - how could there not be? - but I can't bring myself to change the channel, so transfixed am I by its sheer, mind-boggling horribleness. It's like driving past a car accident. You know you shouldn't look, and right after you do you feel cheap, almost soiled. Once you get a first glance of the carnage, however, the decision whether or not to gawk in fascinated horror is no longer yours.Indeed, ""Batman & Robin"" is bad enough that it could find a second life on the midnight movie circuit, like ""Rocky Horror"" or Ed Wood's movies. It might be fun to dress in costume and, say, throw ice cubes at the screen every time Schwarzenegger speaks. Someone should get some enjoyment out of this movie.

If anyone says ""Hey shall we rent Batman and Robin on DVD"" render them unconscious and watch either the first two or the fifth one and leave this limp leaf hanging from the Batman tree in the mud.",Batman & Robin
451,alexis_240,I don't think it's Schumacher's fault,3,26 February 2007,"I'll refrain from making exaggerated comments and simply put down my angle on why this movie did not do well and is regarded as the worst entry in the Batman franchise.To start with it's not Schumacher's fault, alright he was responsible for the much hated nipples I'll give you that, but he was just expected to deliver a lighter child like action blockbuster and he did it. Blame Warner Bros. I personally do not see anything too dark about Batman returns. What's wrong with everyone? Too dark this too dark that, nothing is too dark. It's just darker than the first. Warner Bros were unhappy with the result leading to Batman forever and the exclusion of the massively talented Tim Burton. The amount of artistic freedom he was given in Batman returns is obvious. Batman is called the dark knight, he therefore fights dark villains he is not the only black dressed person in a colorful circus which is supposedly Gotham city (If Schumacher's Gotham was supposed to be a city ravaged by crime then I'm a priest). The much desired commercialism of the last two movies is evident. In Batman forever the bat mobile was obviously designed in order to make a toy that could sell. Why else would they have put a huge fin at the back that served no purpose other than preventing the car from entering a low tunnel?. The bat mobile in the first two is first of all practical and then come the rest. In batman and Robin commercialism has gone up to a whole new level. Attention is being paid to action sequences and not the story e.g. what about Robin? What does he do stay in the mansion all day long? Why not expand on his character a little bit? But no they had to make cars that could sell, they had to shoot incredible action sequences, which I admit I found quite impressive but not enough, any studio with a lot of money could have made them.Nevertheless even though I do not agree with Batman returns being too dark, the creator of Batman, whose name I've forgotten, thought so too! Val Kilmer said that he'd tell him that he liked what he did. So it's quite complicated when it comes to who to put the blame on.Anyway overall, I believe this movie failed because it was rushed into which is also evident in the shallow story and the unnecessary presence of Bruce Wayne's romantic interest, it's far too family friendly to be a movie about a dark night and finally the action sequences seem to have occupied Goldsman more than character development.",Batman & Robin
452,X2Nightcrawler,Defently DC (Dumb Crap) Comics,4,7 November 2003,"I never liked the Batman's really, i do own ""Batman Forever"" because I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, but I don't like watching it.  I don't like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Latern, etc.  DC Comics aren't good, I'm a big fan of MARVEL who now has their time with Spider-Man, DareDevil, X-Men, Blade, Punisher, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Captain America, etc.)  DC movies at less seem to have no real realisum in their films.  Sure all the actors are great (Mike, Jack, Danny, Michelle, Tommy Lee, Val, Nicole, Jim, Drew, Pat, Arnold, Geroge, Uma, Chris, Alisa, etc.), but that's because of other films. In the whole series batman has been 3 acts (Mike ""Batman"" & ""Batman Returns"", Val ""Batman Forever"", & George ""Batman & Robin"").  I really don't like the films at all, infact when i went to see this at the drive-in i fell alseep because it was much better than seeing this movie, all i wanted to see was Face/Off.

453,haxleyandrew,"Don't like this film, It's the worst film ever!",1,4 February 2012,"I'm sorry to say this, But Batman & Robin has got to be the worst film out of all the Batman flicks.Batman & Robin was the worst film ever since it came out, And Joel Schumacher ruined it for every Batman fan out there. This movie did not even deserve to be on the best movies list of all time because compared to how bad it really is a bad flick. Not only is the film itself something to hate, But also because nobody cares for it at all. We've had this film a long time ago and we just hated it. Because the story, Concept, And plot were ruined by Schumacher once again.Again serious things happened in this film. But because it was a total piece of garbage, I'm not gonna go into that. The point is that Schumacher made a film so bad that it ruined the franchise for Batman. Because the first two previous films of Batman Returns which had Batman face off against the Penguin and Catwomen and Batman 1989 which had him face off against The Joker played by Jack Nicholson, And not almost anyone can forget that Schumacher's version of Batman is seriously ruined by this horrible film.The acting was the worst in this film. All the characters had acted in different situations as if nothing happened. Uma Thurman who plays as Poison Ivy is just way different at her role then ever. I mean c'mon if you cannot ruin such a good franchise then don't ruin it for the actors. And i mean she looked better but her acting was just plain horrible. And Robin in this film was definitely worse then ever because he just played so horribly that nobody enjoyed it at all. And in the comics Poison Ivy was a lot better but lost everything here and her performance was not scary. Arnold Schwarzenegger's role as Mr Freeze here was pretty good as he played in other films like The Terminator, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, And Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines, And even Commando, I'm sorry to say this for some fans who missed out on this horrible film. But his voice and his performance does not top it off here. Worst of all it does not even make sense of what he's saying. Mr Freeze was a lot intelligent in the comics and TV Shows, But in this film he just mumbles a lot, And Alicia Silverstone is the same perhaps through her Performance is just as silly as Robin's was. And guess what the last but not least is George Cloony who plays as Batman and guess what his character does not even become scary none the less.Arnold Schwarzenegger's lines were a lot better and Mr Freeze was better then Uma Thurman, Not only did she disappoint but she also really did not do all that well throughout the film.This used to be a masterpiece but now it's not. And the director Joel Schumacher, And don't even get me started on how he directed this film. He must have been under pressure to direct such a good movie and then go out to spoil it for everyone including the audience. And even though he wanted to make this movie a lot darker then it actually would turn out. He failed once again and that's all i can say is he failed. Not a better director and not the best director after all and he just made everyone look bad because of this garbage.But George Clooney was better in his performance in this film. But failed yet again, Because both Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and Micheal Keaton in Batman 1989 did a great job as the caped crusader. George Clooney's Batman is a lot worse then his role. Plus he does not stand out well enough in this movie to be darker then how he acts. And he is just terrifying to just think about if you wanted him to do something better. But also because The Riddler was always making jokes to annoy Batman in Batman Forever. Now that film was a lot better then this garbage.Still Joel Schumacher should stop directing horrible films like these, It's times when he should be put in time out and should stop making horrible classic superhero films like this. Tim Burton was a lot better when making Batman films like the Batman 1989 film and the Batman Returns film. But because of this yet horrible garbage. I should say that this failed to entertain me in the most possible way of watching. But also because Tim Burton's version of Batman was a lot darker and more disturbing then this film was and was also scary. I'm sorry but i would say that Joel Schumacher should not have spent so much money to make a great film that in the end fails to entertain it's audience. Only one can say that this was a piece of junk back then. But the Batman 1989 was a lot better and darker then this.Also Christopher Nolan's films of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were a lot better and were more darker then this garbage compared to how bad it already is. But also Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had Christian Bale as Batman and Heath Ledger as The Joker. He was a better villain and he would always cause anarchy and chaos in Gotham City allowing him to do many evil things all by himself and of course Batman was a vigilante and more darker because of how he looked and how good he played as. I give Christopher Nolan talent and praise for being such a great director and because of how good he makes his films. And also the 1960's TV Show with Adam West as Batman is also better and also with Robin. But just because this film is popular does",Batman & Robin
454,eurom44,Sayings are funny in German,4,18 December 2019,"In German, the sayings are really funny and cool. Otherwise, the film is too colorful, cheesy. Reminiscent of the series from the 1960s.",Batman & Robin
455,michaelsharples96,"Not at all good. But bearing in mind, I have seen worse",3,15 March 2014,"When I first watched this film. I had no idea what to think. But after a few watches. It kind of grows on you. For a family film it's all you want. Cheesiness and all round fun. That being said. I can't even think of all the things wrong with this movie but I'll try my best not to bore you all. Let's start with Bane: The fact that he was created by some dumb ass scientist instead of coming up with his formula himself was just not comic related in anyway, and was just an abomination of the character. Also the fact they made him into some babbling idiot who can't even say his own name, even though bane is actually a genius was ridiculous. Even making him a person who's only there for breaking down walls and saying only 3 lines throughout the whole movie, I mean his longest sentence was saying the word ""bomb"" every 3 seconds over and over again. Being bossed around by Poison Ivy like some little lap dog just would not happen either, we know Bane wouldn't stand for that kind of crapFreeze: It occurred to me that people actually liked Schwarzenegger's performance as freeze which is a mystery to me by itself. The way he was written, I just didn't get it. As if his one liners weren't bad enough, I mean the reason that he uses the word ""cold"" in every single analogy is about as cliché as possible he must reference the cold at least 30 times, what the hell is the point? Using diamonds to power his suit, come on surely a genius like Victor Fries can think of something less money consuming as diamonds. Batgirl: she has 10 minutes on screen as Batgirl and is a completely pointless addition/character to the movie. Making her Alfred's niece as well. It's like the writers wanted to purposely to annoy us in any and every way possible. Robin: Now, Robins character in my opinion was quite well written and the only thing the writers got right. All the little innuendos and references to becoming his own hero and being tired of living in Batman's shadow were completely true to the comic books which is exactly what we look for in the 'Perfect' adaptation of a live action comic book movie. All the little things I'm not gonna go into too much detail. The fight scenes themselves were just outright appalling, the fight scenes from the the 66-68 series were better mainly because in this film there really weren't any. The grapnel hooks, what the hell were those things. I know I was only one year old when this film was released, back then I liked it. But when I started reading and learning the truth behind certain characters I watched the film again and I kind of hated it. But there are some points to the film, that if not for the comic books, would have been a feel good family romp. It is also a very cheesy film that is so bad, it's good. Kind of like Flash Gordon. Over the years and many more watches I've sort of grown to like it.",Batman & Robin
456,tbuchalski,"Batman & Robin: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",7,26 May 2019,"The Good:
This film came at the wrong time chronologically among Batman's film and television appearances. Whether it was too late or too early is unclear, but there was obviously once a place for the camp and self-reflexivity of this film in the canon. Maybe there will be a time for it again, but for all its failings and criticisms, this film is a gem in Batman's big screen run between 1989 to 1997. The best film franchises establish longevity in embracing formula, and entrenching established conventions. This film was too heavy handed in these practices, and was too ambitious in its referrals back to earlier iterations of the franchise, leading to the criticisms of its over the top camp. But, camp and color are a part of Batman's history so the nod to the comics, the 1960's tv show and film earn a fitting place in Batman media after nearly six decades of crime-fighting adventures.The Bad:
This film was as close to cast for star power rather than for real acting chops as could be. George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, and Alicia Silverstone were all rising stars at casting and release. As it turned out, however, their combined star power wasn't enough to launch this film to an acceptable box office to produce another follow up film. The poor performances are the largest contributor to the film's failure to deliver on camp as an acceptable franchise convention moving forward. Worst of the casting choices for this film was replacing Val Kilmer with George Clooney as Batman. Keaton and Kilmer both played men conflicted about the nature of being both Bat and Bruce. Clooney only plays a man nostalgic about his youth as he's confronted with Alfred's mortality in between flashes of his rehashed character from E.R.The Ugly:
When the camp of the caped crusader was popular on the small screen, 20th Century Fox brought Batman to the big screen as a ready example for the franchise fit of Batman. Individual films can fail, but the staying power of a true franchise hero can shine through time as is the case with the Dark Knight as he's made appearances in print and on screen across eight decades. Batman: The Movie (Leslie H. Martinson, 1966) began the big screen obsession with Batman and his ongoing quest to right wrongs, and constant entanglements with the likes of The Joker, The Penguin, and Catwoman. Because Uma Thurman's performance in Batman & Robin is so obviously an homage to Merriweather, Newmar, and Kitt opposite Adam West's Batman, it cannot be understated that this early film established Batman as a box office juggernaut even if it underperformed at the box office, and the television series waned in popularity through the second and third season effectively shelving a sequel.",Batman & Robin

458,kylemcdavid-27399,"This kinda make ""Batman Forever"" a better batman movie",2,25 September 2017,"OH BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is going to be fun talking about this. I don't even know how to start talking about this crap anyways,let moves-on to the plot.Basically going to start this by asking does this sounds familiar. Okay, there's a new villain in Gotham, Mr. Freeze, who want to steal every diamond at every museums in order to cure his dying wife while at the same time causing chaos throughout the city. Meanwhile, there's a scientist who is being vengeful and quickly became another new villain, Poison Ivy, and soon teamed-up with Freeze on his chaos, and it up for Batman, Robin, and later Batgirl, to take them down. Yeah, pretty much Schumacher is ripping off his own film which was ""Batman Forever"", which shows the first big problem of this film, that Schumacher doesn't seems creative making this movie by stealing another plot of a film he already made.The Characters are all equally bad with such a terrible script and cringey dialog that makes this look like one of the filmmakers have help from their children that are in kindergarten. To nail-down each character which another complaint is they have too many here, like it insane and unnecessary. Anyways, I might nailed down each one, beginning with Robin, who does nothing here but just complains about the fact that he thinks Batman is jealous of the fact Poison Ivy loves him (She pretends to, so she can kills him) and it just unwatchable, it just so disappointing to see this as this role is reprised by Chris O'Donnell, and he didn't even know what was even going on with his role in this film, seriously. He was more emotional in the first movie, like a tortured soul, here he just turns into a freaking cry-baby. Batman on the other hand, is just sickening to see. Why there's always a grin on his face, what is he even smiling about, SERIOUSLY!!!! George Clooney the man who plays him this time, admits that during the production of this movie, stated that he doesn't wants Batman to be a tortured character, which is what Schumacher decide to turns him to in this crap, like seriously that ruins the concept of Batman, made him into a I don't know, Bible-Man. Just Stupid. Batgirl, is by far, meh. Now I honestly don't mined the changes they made for her because they were smart with this, by turning her into Alfred Pennyworth's niece, instead of Commissioner Golden's Daughter, which there nothing wrong with making her not his daughter, it just the Commissioner Golden of these films is someone I really despise, as he totally don't look like someone that would take care of a kid. Now this is a bad idea because they cast an American actress Alicia Silverstone to play the part, now half of this is not a problem as she is hot, but the issue her character is suppose to be British, and she sure did not shows a British accent here. Her character is just so forgettable, I don't really have that much to say. Going on to the villains is the worst of this, Mr. Freeze, my god his script is what this film is popular. Arnold Schwarzenegger, why, why you're in this, his Austrian accent makes it worst, it cringey and it really should speaks to itself, this is why the movie is strangely a cult following. Poison Ivy, again like batgirl, she attractive, but her lines, god, just kills me hearing it. Not much to say moved-on. Finally, and I save this one for last, Bane, the most butchered character, of all. Actually all of Humanity. Thanks Christopher Nolan for Reassuring him, and Two-Face, its a honor. Everything about him in this film, they just got wrong, like shows he dumb, NO!!! Bane is one of the Intelligent characters in the history of Comics, he figured Batman's true identity, not a joke, in this all he just said is BANE!!!! Sounds like he a drunken idiot. Nothing else about him, except he's a bodyguard for Poison Ivy, that all he's for really, nothing else, never breaks Batman's back, the most important thing he have even did, never even happens, he never even stops by Batman, but instead the two knuckleheads (Robin and Batgirl). The one question however remains is where is Dr. Chase Meridian, they seems to be forgotten about her within the film. Instead by some blend character, who clearly not much but Bruce Wayne's love interest of the film. There tons and tons of problems like the style of Gotham City from Batman Forever is still here, but more worst. Of-Course the Bat-Nipples and Bat-Butts, obviously shows Schumacher taking his Homosexuality into a serious level, as well too many Neon colors to just to makes you illegally blind. The terrible Bat Vehicles, more pointless dialog than Action, it just a mess, a big fat mess. Now it seems like they're were late enough some serious subject matter here, like having Alfred dying at the end, but with us seeing terrible acting like ""Ice man, Coming"" or ""Cool Party"" (Both said by Mr. Freeze), just butchered things here. Anyways, this film is something you definitely need to stay away from, its not worth your time. If you really want to see a batman film with some cringey dialog, but yet a-lot of fun, check out Batman: The Movie from 1966.",Batman & Robin

Every actor is terrible, every scene is terrible, the make up, the effects, the nonsensical fight scenes where people fall down and you have no idea why. It's the worst.

The main character castings are again a case of highly reputable names, but with performances that are subpar compared to their usual level - and Clooney simply isn't Batman material in my books, and especially not with this ""performance"". As the only positive note of sorts I have to say I feel kinda sorry for Michael Gough, as he is the only one putting in a respectable performance with nothing bad to say about it.What is also painstakingly evident is the horrid extras. The acting is just so bad and over the top that it rivals the worst B-class movies I've seen, and this apparently being an attempt at comedy/parody is simply no excuse for it. The guards, the crowd noises, the telescope event hostess... it's painful.How Schumacher managed to go so low with his Batman interpretations is a real mystery to me.

465,dobrien4587,What a freaking load.....,3,19 August 2010,"Usually it's the third film that kills a movie franchise, and let me get this out of the way; I actually LIKED Batman Forever. But little good can be said about this piece of crap.Continuing the villain formula started by ""Returns"" We have two more Batman villains; Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. These two are however, in my opinion the LEAST engaging of the Batman villains, not just in television, but in the movie franchise all together. I mean hell, Riddler and Two-Face broke into Bruce's home, destroyed the Bat cave, and Friggin SHOT him in the head. What did Ivy and Freeze do? well Freeze attempted to freeze Gothom and Ivy did absolutely nothing.While Ivy and Freeze are doing all this, Batman and Robin bicker at each other for most of the film. We are also introduced to Barbara (Batgirl). However George Clooney, try as he might, couldn't play Batman if you put a gun to his head.Hell, Batman hardly develops at all, which is to say NONE of the characters develop. Most of them I dare you to give a damn about, except maybe Freeze, but thats about it.The action scenes are incredibly over-the-top. All of it is unconvincing and goofy, but not in a good way. Some of the scenes don't even make sense! For example, in the opening, when Freeze is trying to get his gun off a tall pillar that is a few feet in front of him, he grabs a guard and throws him at the pillar, knocking the gun.....right into Freezes arms...........The complex dialog has also been reduced to corny one-liners and goofy jokes about ice and plants and gay innuendos, and the story isn't much better, if not worse.I read on line that during the production of Batman and Robin that they were going to make another Batman film called Batman Triumphent, thank God almighty that this film tanked at the box office and prevented another Shumacher film.

As they fight off they're enemies, Batman and Robin must learn to work together...MY THOUGHTS: What hasn't been said about this movie and how bad it is? I feel I need to stress though that this movie is a comedy and a different take on the character. Sure if can be goofy and over the top, but the action is still good and it is still a very entertaining film. I actually enjoyed this ""different"" approach on the characters and the way it was portrayed. PROS/CONS: Arnold Schwarzenegger was a very good choice to play Mr. Freeze. His lines weren't the best in my opinion, but I did still find the character to be a threat to Batman. With that said however, there are times where your patience with this character draws really thin. Uma Thurman was a fairly good choice for Poison Ivy, though I thought the character was rather boring and that she was not needed in the picture. Then I get to Bane, or lack there of. In this movie, other than his strength and threatening appearance, he was by far the most useless. All he did was say his own name and make various idiotic sounds. What it comes down to is that this movie had way too many characters in it and it becomes unbalanced and a complete mess. With all that said though, it is still very entertaining with the laughs and is a good ""superhero stopping the bad guy from taking over the world"" story. RATING: 8/10",Batman & Robin
467,oldchummer,What to say...,1,9 May 2017,"Everything bad to say about this movie has already been said. Quite possibly the worst comic book movie of that decade, and definitely the worst Batman movie. The 60s Batman was really silly, but actually felt like it was meant to be kind of comedic. This movie actually tries to put themes of family tragedies in the script along with the immensely ridiculous campy tone that loomed over the movie. Its the reverse of what most movies are. Movies usually have moments of levity to sometimes ease the drama, yet this movie has attempted drama moments to try and ease the silliness. This movie just simply doesn't work.",Batman & Robin
468,duffyboy666,"Quick Robin, To the Bat-Cave! We must hide our heads in shame!",2,22 June 2005,"What does Batman's first blockbuster movie in 1989 have in common with Batman the movie of the 1960's? That's right, nothing. They don't in any way whatsoever mix. Joel Schumacher unfortunately assumes otherwise.You see, this is supposed to be the fourth instalment in the blockbuster Batman series. So it needs to follow the trend of Batman, Batman Returns and for some part, Batman Forever. The dark, Gothic caped crusader must be there. The storyline must be based centred on Batman fighting crime to avenge the death of his parents and protect the innocent. And most importantly, you must have some kind of plot that follows the dark knight style trend and is at least to some extent believable. Sadly Joel Schumacher has mixed barely even a quarter of this, together with a huge dollop Adam Wests camp fest of the sixties. And the result truly is a complete mess.Twatman & Bobbins would probably be the best title for this over-hyped big budget disgrace. Joel Schumacher and George Clooney have completely ruined what Tim Burton & Michael Keaton had begun. What Keaton and Burton achieved was magnificent, this is quite frankly a shameful joke. So where to begin. Well we might as well start with the plot and storyline. Anyone who thought Superman IV had the worst plot of any action movie ought to check this out. Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to steal diamonds to save his cryogenically frozen wife, while the beautifully evil Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), yet again another product of a nasty lab accident, who wants to rid the world of humans so the plants can take back their own. The ridiculous nonsense is complete when Ivy decides Mr. Freeze is the man for her. This folks simply isn't what I would by any means call a dark Gothic Batman plot. All I can see is a whole giant bat-pile of suck.But oh dear it gets far worse! And then there's Robin (Chris O'Donnell), who wants his own Batsignal, which causes our bat buddies to bicker while Alicia Silverstone steps up to the plate as Batgirl with little more effort than a butt jiggle. There's also a lot of bat babble about the importance of family. It is here that I feel I should make the point that Chris O' Donnel is the single most annoying person I have ever seen play any role WHATSOEVER in an action film. EVER.Batman and Robin continues to expand on the flaw that has plagued the Batman series since Batman Returns: too many characters, and not enough time to develop them. Whereas the original Batman had three main characters, Batman Returns had four, and Batman Forever had five, now Batman and Robin has six main characters, four of whom have never been seen before (not counting George Clooney's take on the caped crusader). The film is half over before all the introductions are complete. What I find most insulting about this is that the sixth character Bane has been turned from psycho crime boss, into a useless dreck of a mutant. One of the worst misrepresentations of character I ever saw.The film I have to admit is wonderful to look at and the effects are pretty top notch, but it is all totally destroyed by the bad casting, poor direction and of course the ultimate reason why this movie blows hard chunks, the woeful script. Ouch:Batman: And you are...? Batgirl: Batgirl. Batman: That's not very PC. What about Batwoman, or Batperson? Batgirl: I found the Batcave. Robin: I guess we'll just have to kill her. Sorry you're telling me THAT passes as a DC comic script, adapted into a movie? You must be on quite a lot of mind upending substances because I can see just about every true Bat-fan lining up waiting to ram a bayonet through Clooney's neck. Mind you, wouldn't that make for a good ER storyline!But personally what shocks (sickens) me the most is that this made $300m at the box office. I don't know whether this was just people watching for morbid curiosity. Or whether it was the younger more easily satisfied Bat-fan who doesn't know any better. Or maybe even the hardcore Batman fan hoping and praying that this would turn out decent? Either way, it's corporate movie making at its worst. How any true Batman fan can watch the other instalments of the WB Batman series and be satisfied with such a shoddy effort.Batman and Robin is the single worst case of ruining a good franchise I ever saw.Don't watch this film.",Batman & Robin
469,mg!,Joel Schumacher hates Batman,4,15 January 1999,"Yes, I'm on the I Hate Schumacher bandwagon.  Though I wish I could lead it. I'll be upfront, I liked Tim Burton's vision of the Dark Knight.  It is dark and disturbing.  Why not?  In a world where there are Jokers, Penguin Men, and Two-face killers, it would be pretty screwed up.  If you want bright camp - go watch Superman.  I will give JS one credit, it opened my eyes what a director can do with a movie.  Arnold was a brave, risky choice as Mr. Freeze and I liked it.  Uma was fair as Poison Ivy.  One was enough for a movie, but not both.  Not to mention Batgirl!  Haven't we learned anything from Batman Returns?  Schumacher wanted camp, so badly he would destroy a franchise and bankrupt a studio.  After all, he's always right, and millions of paying customers are wrong.  Now it's time for my quick gripes: Batgirl is the commissioner's daughter, not Alfred's long lost niece!  (Her introduction could have waited a movie or so) Alfred had more lines than Batman.  Rename the movie to Alfred Returns. Bane was not supposed to be so wimpy.  (and not a cab driver!) Now I'll attack the story, let's compare to Batman Forever: BF: Batman fights off two villains. BnR: Batman fights off two villains. BF: An employee of Bruce Wayne goes insane, threatens company. BnR: An employee of Bruce Wanyne goes insane, threatens company. BF: Explanation of villain on video (2-face) BnR: Explanation of villain on video (Mr. Freeze) BF: Wayne goes to fund raiser, event gets crashed. BnR: Wayne goes to fund raiser, event gets crashed. BF: Teen pokes around mansion, discovers bat cave, becomes sidekick. BnR: Teen pokes around mansion, discovers bat cave, becomes sidekick. BF: Movie ends with heroes falling to their doom. BnR: Movie ends with heroes falling to their doom.My wish: Pretend Batman 3 and 4 NEVER existed, bring back Carrey and Arnold, and rewrite the movies.  Sure it'll cost half-a-billion dollars!  But the world would be such a happier place to live.",Batman & Robin
470,Leonidos,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,2,4 December 2000,"In all but the best movies there is usually at least one person horribly miscast i.e. Glenn Close in Air Force One, Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace etc.This is the only movie I have ever seen where EVERYBODY was miscast.  I'm a fan of both Clooney and Arnold but they were just plain wrong for their roles.  Clooney played his characters perfectly in From Dusk til Dawn and Three Kings but he just couldn't pull off the rather dark moody Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Arnold plays a great action star and was perfect in the Terminator movies but Mr. Freeze is supposed to be a brilliant scientist in mourning for his wife.  The Mr. Freeze portrayed by the fairly recent animated series is one of the best villains of all time and could have been brilliantly duplicated by Patrick Stewart but alas.  Alicia Silverstone is miscast in any role outside of Clueless and Chris O'Donnell should be permanently banned from action movies.  Uma Thurman probably could have pulled off the Poison Ivy role but the script for the character was just stupid and what the hell was up with the hairdo?  Also annoying was the superstrong hitman character from the comic book Bane who was reworked into a totally unnecessary and brainless henchman for Ivy that barely even appears.  in the end the only person that accomplishes what he needed to in his role was Michael Gough as Alfred doing his usual excellent job as the wise butler that he filled in the previous 3 movies.

This movie is pretty bad.The ""Batman"" movies started out dark and gritty and ended up evolving back into the Adam West days.I'd be alot harsher on this movie...it's just that I think ""Batman Forever"" is worse and even though this movie is very pathetic,I'm not as harsh because I know there's another movie worse than this.I digged Uma Thurman in this...she was really hot and I was kinda wishing she would beat Batman...she was more interesting than our hero, and that's been a problem of the Batman movies...the title character is always being overshadowed by the villains.As for Arnold...this isn't is finest hour.The good part about this movie is Michael Gough,who is always good as trusty Alfred.Overall,I'll rank the Batman movies like this: 1.Batman Returns-Pretty Good,best of the lot. 2.Batman-Good,but nothing special. 3.Batman and Robin-Pretty lame,deserves what it got. 4.Batman Forever-Total Disaster,worst comic book movie ever.",Batman & Robin

The one point I do wish to emphatically emphasize is that the only ""Batman"" movie that didn't have a script GROSSLY INFERIOR to the comic books (and graphic novels) was the full-length animation ""Mask of the Phantasm."" Why does Hollywood insist on paying people to write scripts for ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" that REALLY SUCK compared to the comic books? If you don't believe me, read the great graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns."" Also, George Clooney was the worst of the three actors to play Batman and Chris O'Donnell is way too big and old to be Robin.

In fact it is one of the worst action hero films ever made and that includes Superman IV, which was better than this film. Joel Schumacher sought to bring Batman back to the childish level after Tim Burton had apparently made the series too dark. This was a huge mistake. Gotham City looked cheesy and fake, the dialogue was filled with the worst one-liners imaginable. Worst of all the villians which carried the first three films were absolutely terrible. George Clooney was unconvincing as Batman and Batgirl was shall I say a disgrace to feminism to say the least. Alfred's death angle was lame and did not engage the audience at all. The Bat suits looked overly erotic and quite silly. The action scenes were elaborate but boring and confusing. I'm tired. 1 out of 10: Dont buy it, dont rent it, dont watch it.",Batman & Robin

I also kind of liked Alicia Silverstone in her role as Batgirl. I also thought it was a little sick when two prison guards in one bit where making Mr. Freeze suffer in a cell.Although I kind of enjoyed it, I didn't feel the respect I had for the first two movies, which I thought were great Batman films.There's not a lot that I can say for this movie, but I feel that if you want to watch a more decent Batman film, watch the newer ones or the two Tim Burton directed.

480,amolghadi,Blasphemy Plus Sacrilege,1,11 August 2008,"An appeal to Bob Cane (RIP), Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, Jeph Loeb and others who worked hard to make Batman actually as he should be:"" Forgive these mortal people (who worked on B&R) for they do not do this intentionally for fun's sake (that anyway does not exist in this crap) but just out of the age-old sin called 'GREED'."" Yes, this is a perfect example of what happens when a group of mere mortals, out of some greed to make more money, get together to reduce an immortal legend to scrap.But the worse part was that one of those mortals was the production company itself that was assigned with the task of preserving the Legend as it was.Way back in 1997, when I watched this movie in theaters as a teenager and knew nothing much about The Batman except that he is a superhero who works at nights, I was not that much interested in Batman as I was in Schwarzenegger. I was and still am a big fan of Arnold for everything he is and whatever he has done in his life. Given an opportunity of four lifetimes, ordinary people won't be half as successful as he is today, in those four lifetimes. But... an actor, director or the producer can NOT be larger than the character in the movie itself. If they try to be, that is Blasphemy for me. And today, after reading a lot of authentic material about The Batman, I realized they actually practiced Blasphemy. They destroyed the characters of all: Batman himself, Robin, Batgirl, Poison Ivy and in particular my favorites Mr. Freeze and Bane (oh, that was the cruelest blow.) OK, I can imagine this: Suddenly out of some sleep, Warner Bros. wakes up and thinks itself to be the Disney Company. Now they're thinking of nothing but money and more money. They bring on Goldsman who also wakes out of some deep slumber and jolts down on a piece of paper, something called 'family friendly script for B&R'. WB, already wearing the goggles of greed on its eyes, approves it. WB then brings on-board the same Schumacher who had already destroyed Batman in 'Batman Forever'(I won't even mention the year, I won't want people to refer to it on IMDb.). And then what follows is the non-direction of actors with capabilities ranging from OK to Good, acting for a non-existent script with campy utterly-bad stunts/visual effects/lights/one-liners. And its unimaginable they decide to use Batman as a medium for family entertainment(???) (which he is not for), just because they had the rights to Batman franchise ! Acting: George Clooney as Batman? He only plays himself and lays himself in every movie he works with (OK, 'Ocean's Eleven', 'Three Kings', 'Syriana', 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' were good but there are more bad movies of his then good ones.). He could never make it as the Dark Brooding Vengeful Batman. Uma Thurman, a decent actress herself, has bordered on the lines of cheap profanity here as if undergoing fake multiple org**ms. That's the ONLY way to describe it. I can't believe she played 'Poison Ivy'. And I can't believe Arnie rolled back his promise of not playing villains in movies for this scrap role that was anything but Mr. Freeze. Oh, yes! the money, of course! 30 million something! A record at that time! I can understand these actors are helpless in front of the big three: producer, writer, director. But they at least knew what they were getting into and that makes them guilty enough. I am OK with the IMDb's concept of not having ZERO in their rating system. Otherwise, it will appear as if even though any movie whether, good or bad, people are not aware of it and therefore nobody rated it. But IMDb should come up with one negative rating: '-1'. Particularly for movies like this. At the time of me writing this, this scrap is rated as high as '3.5' ! Do people who rate scrap as more than '1', exist? This is a sacrilege for Batman fans like me. I observed some people rated this movie 9/ 10 just because 'they liked it, the fun/action and all'. But then where would then the actual masterpieces like 'Schindler's List(1993)', 'SE7EN(1995)', Goodfellas(1990), Godfather,The(1972-74), Terminator(1984-91), Matrix,The(1999-03), ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001), LOTR(2001-03), Silence of the Lambs(1991-2003), Forrest Gump(1994), Malcolm X(1992), Glory(1989), Cry freedom(1987), Sixth Sense,The(1999), Unbreakable(2000), Elizabeth(1999) stand? Thankfully, common sense prevailed and Nolan brought the real-real Batman movie: 'Batman Begins(2005)' and the phenomenal masterpiece: 'Dark Knight,The(2008)'.No other good or great movie from Schumacher, Oscar winners Goldsman or Clooney is going to repair the irreversible damage that they have done to Batman. (They never read the Batman comics, They just shamelessly *BEEP*ed it up.). I hope these three Blacken their faces and hide somewhere, Oscar winners or not. All existing records/proofs/sources of this B&R-scrap should be destroyed. NOW.... And there were no Nipples needed on the Bat or Robin suit which they anyway showed. But they somehow forgot to put them on the suit of the full-some Batgirl. How hypocrite is that? Maybe, otherwise, I just would have found her more erotic enough and given this movie a one extra star. My Rating: '-1' / 10.",Batman & Robin

Starting with Batman from 1989 and ending with this one. Now, the last movie in the old Batman series of movies. And what do I think about it? The word that the dictionary would use is probably: DISGRACE!This movie is so bad not even the director (Joel Schumacher) liked it. Everything is wrong, bad or worse. The story, just kidding ya, there is no story. The plot, or bad excuse for one, is this: Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy teams up in order to shape Gotham after their vision. That doesn't make sense since Freeze want's to freeze down the city while Ivy want's it to be full of wild plants. Yes, the artic is well known for it's exotic plants. All acting is beyond horrible. Uma Thurmans Ivy is high on her own supply. Arnold is so wrong as Mr. Freeze. If you wan't to see a good Mr. Freeze go watch the Batman: The Animated Series episode Heart of Ice instead. The only reason he was cast was because Joel thought that Mr. Freeze should be like carved out from a glacier. That's the most corny thing I've ever heard. Batgirl and Robin are just pure crap and not done probably. This movie is a disgrace to Bob Kane, Frank Miller, Burton, The animated Series and everyone who ever loved Batman.

Joel Schumacher drove the BATMAN series into the ground in only two movies!Granted, BATMAN FOREVER was tolerable, but this is an absolute mess from start to finish.  From its incomprehensible ""action"" sequences (I dunno, usually when a character throws a punch, you see it connect with someone something], but not here), with bodies flying through the air as if made of paper, to its dopey ""extreme sports"" nonsense (which add nothing but extreme tedium), this is a total waste of time.I saw it free and felt cheated; it's two hours of my life I can't get back. I could have been watching paint dry, or my hair grow and would have been more satisfied.  I brought my six-year-old, a HUGE Batman fan, and he was looking up at the projection booth, at other audience members, ANYTHING but the incomprehensible mess on the screen.With any luck at all, there will NEVER be another Batman movie directed by Joel Schumacher.

When I was a small child, I had nightmares about monsters under my bed, kidnappers, alien, etc. To tell you the truth, I wet my bed frequently until the age of six. After seeing Batman and Robin, the nightmares returned. So did the bed wetting.2. The acting: What acting? In fact, it's worse than bad. The english language can't describe how bad it is. No language can. George Clooney turns the dark and brooding Batman into a happy crime fighter with spunk! I don't ever want to see a man in that much rubber smiling at me again.3. The plot: It's bad. Every hollywood cliche is thrown in. To make you feel sympathy, they threaten Alfred's death. ""Oh no...the only likable character is dying..."" HE WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE MOVIE! Save yourself Alfred. Kill yourself, and you'll go warp speed to eternal happiness. I'm sure God will forgive you for being in this ""film"".4. The special effects: They're really bad. Gotham is now lit with neon pink and blue lights. EVERYTHING is in neon. Batman and Robin show a blatant disrespect for the laws of physics. I'm not talking about standard movie stunts i.e; riding a shockwave, jumping off a 100 foot cliff, living through huge explosions, etc., etc....They surf through the air, falling thousands of feet through the air, sometimes moving STRAIGHT UP. Batman falls, then moves upward, completely defying gravity.5. The flaws: they're everywhere. At one point, Robin is being pulled underwater. The shot goes like this: Robin is floating in the water-the villain pulls him under the water briefly-he resurfaces. Simple, right? Well instead of ACTUALY SHOOTING THE SCENE, they simply reverse the film halfway through the shot, so it looks like he's coming out of the water, when in fact you're seeing him go UNDERWATER backwards. ALSO, Alfred (just off his deathbed) whips up a batsuit for Alicia Silverstone in a matter of minutes.6. The rubber: Alicia Silverstone doesn't have nipples on her batsuit, but Batman and Robin DO. THere are butt-shots and crotch-shots GALORE! What is wrong with Joel Schumacher? I think we all know...7. In one scene, Mr. Freeze wants to freeze Gotham, so he goes to the city observatory, and plants little plastic icicles all over the telescope. Then he goes to the top, and it's magically transformed to some kind of freeze-ray. Does this make sense to you? THis sounds like it was written by a tow year old. It makes about as much sense as the scene in ""Kindergarten Cop: where the little boy puts his ""lazers"" (actually balls of tinfoil) all over a power line near his house.8. There are too many characters. There's Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane. That's six characters with twelve personalities. This film gives new meaning to the word ""filth"".9. It's a testament to the stupidity of the american viewing audience that movies like this rake in millioms of dollars, while great movies like ""The Spanish Prisoner"" and ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" wallow in relative obscurity.10. There is no plot, character development, intelligence, or thoughtfulness behind this movie. No story, no uniqueness, no artistic touches. There aren't any clever camera techniques or special effects. Just a bunch of ever-larger explosions.11. This movie has nothing good in it, so they try to fill the gaping hole with loud special effects, more characters, and more one-liners.12. This film insults your intelligence.13. It's too stupid for adults, and too empty for kids.14. The horrible truth is, there are some people who like this movie. These are the kind of people who watch WWF wrestling. These are the kind of people who will never experience the joy of reading a good book (Fahrenheit 451 for instance), or spend more than two seconds in deep thought. I feel sorry for these people.15. The music: They didn't even bother to score new music for this movie, they just reused the music from the last Batman movie. The music is apallingly bad. Good movies have music that fits the scene, that enhances the movie, but doesn't overshadow it. It completes the movie. Films like ""Schindlers List"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Hunt For Red October"" all have music that perfectly fits the movie. This has recycled junk thrown in.16. Joel Schumacher, this is a message for YOU: We (the viewing public) don't want to pay seven dollars to see garbage. WE want to see movies that make us think. When you leave a good movie, you can't stop thinking about it. When you leave this movie (this could happen as quickly as two minutes after the opening credits), all I think is ""I want my money back"". When I left this movie, my ears hurt. My brain hurt. When I left this movie, I left a part of my soul in the theater. It was stolen by the mind-blowingly bad crapfest that is ""Batman and Robin"".",Batman & Robin

Jackson, and I'd still hate him.  They should kill him off in the next movie, worked in the comic books.  BTW: Chris O'Donnell is horrible in the role.Arnold Schwarzenegger: I can see why Patrick Stewart turned down the role. Horribly written, annoying, and not a great villian.  I like Arnold, but he sucked in this movie.Uma Thurman: I sat through this movie watching her and pitying her.  You could see her struggling with such poor direction and script.

You'll swear you're watching the TV series. The wild colors, the slanted camera angles, the campy lines ... The only thing missing is ""POW!"" and ""BAMMM!"" balloons flashing across the screen. Watching this film you have to ask why Joel Schumacher was allowed to take the original concept and warp it into a big screen version of the TV show. I'm almost convinced that he's related to William Dozier in some way.If you can completely forget about ""Batman"" and take ""Batman and Robin"" as a stand-alone flick then it's not a bad one. The cgi special effects are occasionally recognizable as such. The term ""campy"" fits it perfectly.

But even that is ruined by the horrible songs and especially the cheesy and ridiculous song ""Gotham City"" by R.Kelly. I am one of the biggest Batman fans ever, and i couldn't even bear to watch this film. The dialogue is plain, the story is useless, and the characters are just stupid. I won't even go into Mr Freeze's quips and puns. Joel Schumacher ruined Batman with this film, he completely changed the whole idea of Batman being dark and brooding and turned him into an idiot in a suit who isn't even believable fighting crime. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Robin, I feel Batman works best when alone, but it kinda worked OK in Batman Forever, it suited the whole look and direction of the film, but Batman & Robin is just a waste of space and time.So, if you're a Batman fan, and just have even the slightest bit of dignity, avoid this.

The things that also beat the crap out of this movie: every line in the movie was a catchphrase that made you sick to your stomach, next, poison ivy,(not that I hated her) she should have come off as a serious villain. and had more realistic lines. They could have made her absolutely evil, and they would have had at least one decent character, one can wish. and lastly, the effects, i'm not even going to go there.

495,ichwan_mil,A 'brighter' Batman.... He has changed....in a positive way,8,29 October 2010,"Personally I don't understand why a lot of people are against this movie. It is good and entertaining. I've watched it over 5 times and my opinion has not changed. Infamous actors, great sound and visual effects, enjoyable storyline...easily not to be missed. First you have to realize that this is a fantasy movie. Simply put, never expect any 'realism', it's absolutely foolish to do that. The more it defies from reality, the better. Fantasy movie has no limitation. Well, with so much features to be 'unreal', this movie has it all to be a decent fantasy one. Joel Schumacher has bravely changed the fundamental image of Batman series. It used to be 'dark' (hence the nickname 'Dark Knight')but in this movie it receives a significant facelift, it no longer features a bleak world. Nighttime (Dark) is still a major setting, but it is now brighter and more colorful. Batman himself is no longer helplessly haunted by his own past and lamenting on his tragic fate (hey, he's a superhero anyway, why should he do that kind of thing?), he is now grown more optimistic . And unlike its predecessors, which featured more 'serious' atmosphere (to the extent that they even resembled thriller movies), it is now significantly de-emphasized, and so far, it becomes the only Batman movie most appeal to the whole family. What a surprise with all that, but personally I am happy. Finally, a stronger and 'happier' Batman character appears... OK, many Batman fans may curse Schumacher for his infidelity, for his attempts on 'ruining' the images of Batman. But again, do remember about the 'fantasy'. It has no limits. Batman has indeed changed, but in a positive way. Great work, Schumacher. For this reason, I regret that the sequel (Batman Triumphant, also by Schumacher and still features Clooney) was never produced, instead it receives a reboot (Batman Begins), and return to its original dark flair. Alas, I can no longer see the 'happy' Batman. Blame it on Bob Kane - for he was who created Batman with all austerity and forlorn sides the hero is well-known for. Schumacher was just tried to grant Batman a new breathe of life with optimism and happiness this hero deserves - he is an ordinary human being nonetheless. One simple advice for those who want to watch this movie: sit back, relax, and enjoy all this movie has to offer. Just do not bother do the 'damn,it's not the same Batman I know' thinking, just enjoy our hero on his entirely different shape. You will like it.",Batman & Robin

Joel Schumacher has inexplicably inverted the inspired direction Batman was taken by Burton, making it a homage to the 'joke' TV series from the 70's rather than a dark and brooding fantasy.Every set piece and character outside Wayne Manor is decorated with fluorescent pink/yellow/blue and has a cheapness akin to that of your neglected/abandoned local Laser Quasar. The Batsuit has nipples. The Batmobile looks like a disco light machine with no aesthetic qualities or practical purpose. Batgirl is not hot, she's not clever, she's not welcome.

498,grindleguts,What were they thinking?,2,1 September 2012,"I think few movies are as disappointing as 'Batman & Robin' when it comes to making a sequel of a great franchise. The failures begin with the casting: George Clooney as Batman? Straight out of ER where he played a middle-aged grumpy doctor not anywhere near as prominent a character as most of the other actors there.Arnold as a villain doesn't work either. The one time it did work was in 'T1' where his stiff acting with few lines did work out. He is too restrained and precise to make a believable villain that is supposedly mildly insane and plotting evil agendas. Uma Thurman is a bit redeeming as Poison Ivy, but that's about it. The Bane character is ""straight out of a made-for-kids comic stupid"" so to say. Overall the performances are quite forgettable.And the plot is... yeah what is it about? I think I spent most of the movie trying to figure that out. Yes, I was 13 at the time it premiered but it didn't make sense then and it doesn't today. The title gives some premise: Robin gets to take some place as protagonist, but in honesty his character was also prominient in 'Batman Forever'.Seeing Nolan's films makes a stark contrast to the 90's Batman movies, 'Batman & Robin' may be a reference but let us stop at that. 2/10.",Batman & Robin

Now that I am much older and understand more fully the character known as Batman, I was tempted to give this movie a 1 myself! Alas, I am too much of a Batman fan to go that low on a movie review. So I will tell you what I did like about it. In the movie, the dynamic duo are battling more fiends that threaten to cause havoc on Gotham City, but during that, there is an ever so tender sub-plot that reaches the sensitive side of me, Alfred is dying. During the course of the movie Bruce Wayne has flashbacks on when it was just him and Alfred, when Alfred was like a caring father to him.Yes, the Good Guys win and somehow find a way to prevent Alfred from dying, which is I guess now kind of predictable, but still good.

Guys, let's face it: Batman is a guy who dresses in bat clothes and walks around with a high- tech car through the alleys to fighting crime. Now imagine a guy doing it in real life. It would certainly be as funny and ridiculous as George Cloney or Adam West walking the streets. Schumacher's Batman & Robin is a movie that embraces this cartoonism with fervor and without shame. That's why this movie deserves a glorious ten stars. The universe and superhero concept, including our beloved Batman, is often ridiculous and eccentric - things that we, comic book lovers, pretend not to see, because after all we love and will always love all this s.h.i.t like eternal children. The fact that so many hate this movie is that it just rubs these inconvenient facts in our face. Then people turn to films that mask and hide these shameful aspects, like the films of Burton and Nolan. Each one with their preferences, but I definitely continue with the Burton movies, which were dark without losing the sense of humor and without wanting to sound like a pieces of Shakespeare. Meanwhile, Batman & Robin lights up my days making me laugh and The Dark Knight leaves me with depression.",Batman & Robin
511,b2280545,"Entertaining Campiness, Ice Puns And All",7,22 March 2018,"Many people would beat down those who would give Batman and Robin a 7 out of 10 stars. However, the latter proves to be worthy of an average score in this viewer's opinion. In this day and age, it is difficult to find critics who have room in their hearts for goofy movie fun, that is if the film has some form of redeeming factor. There is no denying that Batman and Robin is technically one of the worst movies ever made. From it's ice/plant puns, innuendos, bat suit nipples and buttocks, constant grappling hook saves and George Clooney playing George Clooney dressed as Batman, it is something that feels like an attempted advertisement to sell action figures. The bright and colorful aspect of the film gives it that appearance. Though if people look at it through a more positive perspective, they'll find the film accomplished setting out what it wanted to be from the start. Now that is not to be confused as giving Joel Schumacher credit for putting together this film, turning it from Batman to Power Rangers. The cast really can't be blamed entirely for the film's failing results. They were directed to acting the way they did after all and some of the performances were acceptable while others, one cannot say the same thing. Michael Keaton played the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the original 1989 film and Batman Returns decently until he was replaced by Val Kilmer for 1995's Batman Forever. Kilmer wasn't the most amazing Batman by any means, but he made an effort to as best he could since that film was about as campy as this one. As already mentioned, George Clooney was playing George Clooney through the whole film. Never once could an audience viewer who is a Batman fan could look at him and say ""This is the Batman of my imagination!"" Clooney goes around without showing even the slightest bit of emotion, the kind that the character of Bruce Wayne is supposed to be feeling constantly, especially when he is Batman. He spends most of the time looking after Robin making sure he doesn't get into trouble and while that's good, even then he does not demonstrate fear for his friend/brother. To add on to that, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is the king of camp and ice jokes in the film. Mr. Freeze was never the Joker. He's not very complicated as a character to figure out. He was always a dark, vengeful and hateful man who wants nothing more than to revive his wife from her terminal disease at any cost. Not only does Arnold succeed at being himself as usual, but it's as if he intended to play a Joker/Two-Face knock off of Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones' performances. Additionally, Batgirl's presence in the film wasn't great either. Her character felt out of place from the start being introduced as the niece of Alfred, Wayne's butler. Her transformation into Batgilrl didn't feel legitimate as it did random and unconvincing. On the other hand, Chris O'Donnell's performance was possibly the only performance in the film that felt legit. All throughout, Robin's motivations for doing the things that he does rebelling against Batman are believable. He clearly outshines Clooney's Batman whenever the duo are on screen together. In addition to Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, as campy as she was, did surprisingly well with her role. She was a perfect choice to portray the villain Poison Ivy in this viewer's opinion, even looking great for the part. It is unfortunate that her performance was hindered as a result of being casted for the wrong film. Had she starred in a Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan, she could have excelled. The actor who played Alfred (may he rest in peace) provided the film some heart to heart moments with George Clooney's Bruce Wayne, which were some of the film's best. In conclusion, that is the cast. If we all can just take the film for what it is, as basically a cartoon in live-action, we can find it isn't as bad as the critics say it is. Check out the following youtube address for more insight on what makes the film great https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXHskZCqhiI. It is clear that the film was not meant to be Christopher Nolan's the Dark Knight trilogy. Had Tim Burton, who directed the first two Batman films with Michael Keaton, directed this film, it may have turned out differently. For what it is, it is entertaining. It's one of those cases where it is so bad it's good or so good it's bad. The point being that the film doesn't fail at being the action comedy it is. While it may be a matter of persona opinion, the film contains great humor. Mr. Freeze provides humor related to ice. The character of Bane, while butchered as a villain character, gives a few laughs as Poison Ivy's oafish muscle incapable of speech. The action in the film serves as continuation for the film's camp factor, at the same time quite well done. Beneath the film's campiness is a good message about family and trusting one another, something not many would appreciate but deserves to be recognized. Finally, just because the critics say it's atrocious doesn't make it true. For Batman and Robin, this viewer does not agree that it is the worst thing to ever happen in film. Maybe for Batman but people tend to take movies way out of hand forgetting it's all fiction and not reality. Batman Forever felt like more of a fail than this film for the way it handled it's two villains who turned out obnoxious. The villains felt amusing for this film but people can always agree to disagree on anything.

Where as the original ""Batman"" was a little to dark for my taste, and ""Batman Forever"" blended just the right amount of comic book camp, action and drama, ""Batman and Robin"" looked like it was made by those responsible for ""Operation Condor"", with the only difference being that ""Batman and Robin"" was given a huge budget.  The acting, the story, the characters, the way they raped the comic book and bastardized the character relationships and histories, the not-so-special effects, the writing, the directing (oh God, the directing!  The humanity!), the costumes (it would have been better if the actor's mom's had sewn them, like for a grade school play; it would have been a VAST improvement over what they were ""clad"" in), EVERYTHING SUCKED!!!!  I could write a brief novella on exactly what went horribly wrong on each of these topics, but there is not a enough room in the IMDB to store my comments.

522,boldentommy,a diarrhea dump,1,24 July 2012,"There's a lot of bad movies out there ton's. But they must all be put in separate categories. Big budget,small budget,and no budget. This movie had a huge budget 125 million. OK first with that kind of a budget how in the world could you possibly fail.Well first lets get with the casting. George Clooney is batman. Batman is a dark figure clooney is a good actor but he in no world didn't fit the role so you automatically fail. Arnold Schwarzenegger is Mr.freeze once again another good actor who doesn't fit the role. Mr freeze is doctor and scientist a guy like Patrick Stewart would have been great for this film. But no we cast another guy who doesn't belong. You know im not even going over the rest of the cast because they couldn't get anything right. Once again we find ourselves in this cartoon world that tim burton created. That's a flaw i always had with this movie i understand your trying to give it a comic book feel but that notion died with batman forever.so after all this with thee casting we should have a good film right..............Wrong what we have is time bomb a 125 min time bomb. By the end of this movie your going to wish you would be blown up. The acting is flat and characters insufferable. And last but not least bat nipples and bat credit cards. You have to be joking why is there bat nipples why is there a credit card why is there ice skating what were you thinking. I wouldn't even watch this movie for a good laugh.

523,larseirikf,Batman parody?,2,19 March 2013,"I give this movie 2 stars because it has an ending. I can't even think of a place to start describing all the fails in this plane crash of a movie. First of all, this could be a decent movie if the characters would just shut up. The dialogue is simply horrible, the acting is beyond ridiculously bad, and there are so. many. cheesy word plays! Robin describing Mr. Freeze's henchmen as ""the hockey team from hell"", Mr. Freeze telling people to ""chill"" before freezing them, Ivy telling Batman the plants have got a ""crush on him""... It's just awful. Next, the character interpretations. Uma Thurman is the winner, as her Poison Ivy is recognizable from the DC comics. Then comes Clooney's Batman, which is in short, with no further ado, a tragedy. Next is Robin, whose role is to be a more mature boy wonder, but is acting like a baby throughout the movie. Was this intentional? It doesn't matter; it sucked anyways. And then there's Mr. Freeze. Aka roll your eyes backwards. Could there be any worse than the governator to play this man? If the movie is supposed to be based on the comics, follow the comics! Mr. Freeze is a sad and bitter man, not some clown with cheap word plays and jokes! Leave the actual fun to the Joker! Which brings us to the last villain in this movie, namely Bane. Good. God. DC portrays him as a brilliant strategist as well as a brutal and skilled in combat. He is the one enemy Batman seems unable to beat. And in this movie, he is nothing but a brain-dead, drug-fueled monster who can't do anything but smash bricks and roar. For those of you who don't know him, watch The Dark Knight Rises. That's the REAL Bane. I could go on covering all the errors for a pretty long time, but I think I would need more than 1000 words for the complete summary. In short, cast and crew belong in a life-time sentence with no trial. Shame on all of them.",Batman & Robin

Bane probably is the most intelligent but the dumbest because it seems like he has no brain. Mr. Freeze had a good actor to play his role but he was a confusing character to follow because of his changing emotions when he was supposed to be a heartless villain. Elle Macpherson and her character were a waste of money and talent because her role meant nothing in the film. Poison Ivy was more of a sex-obsessed mother nature than a villain. Money was wasted for cheap props, some horrible casting, and a director who should get out while he can and should not have directed the third and fourth Batman films because they were screw-ups. Don't waste your money for a DVD or VHS copy of one of the worst films of 1997.",Batman & Robin

526,MsFarEast,Hideous is not one way to describe it.,1,22 January 2006,"If anybody can describe this film, it can be done so in many ways. The first thing they will do is 1. defecate one it and call it a bad film. 2. Go all Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas-style with a bullet with the director's name on it. 3. Demand their money back or face the wrath of moviegoers and many other extremely violent (if not suitable) actions, etc. But what it all comes down to is this: Not since Gili, Glitter, You Got Served, and Crossroads has a film been so disgusting and berating of the title character. Batman is a awesome superhero with no superpowers, just sheer brain power and quick reflexes. But as this film points out, it is clear that it was made mainly to appeall to homosexuals. The film's title clearly enforces that fact. If this film was shown on an episode of ""Queer Eye for The Straight Guy"", this film alone should be their first choice.",Batman & Robin
527,crow30002003,"Not the worst, but still pretty bad",3,10 January 2014,"Batman has had a rather interesting evolution throughout the 90s. Starting off with Tim Burton's trademark dark vision which IMO worked perfect for Batman, mixing the Gothic style Burton is known for with a bit of humor without seeming totally over-the-top. Batman Returns took a darker turn bringing in Burton's stock character of a misfit wanting to be accepted by the fickle society he lives in, but it wasn't as successful, so Burton got the boot and enter Joel Schumacher. Batman Forever was a good popcorn flick, but the villain was weak, as it was basically just Jim Carrey cosplaying as the Riddler. With that out of the way, you may be expecting me to give Batman & Robin a verbal thrashing like many reviews that came before, but honestly, it's not as terrible as people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, it earned its nasty reputation, but I want to be fair and praise the movie on what it did right. For instance, some of the special effects were good, rubber icicles aside, sound mix was good, camera work is on point, and some of the music is good. Plus Freeze's backstory from Batman TAS comes back, but that's all the positive comments I can give. Where the movie massively fails is trying to be a revival of the campy 60s TV show. George Clooney is not Adam West, and even though I liked Batman Forever, Clooney and Val Kilmer were the worst men to ever put on the cape and cowl. Chris 'O'Donnell is too angsty for my Robin. I mean I understand, he wants a moment in the limelight with Batman instead of being pushed to the side, but he comes off as an angsty teenager. Arnold Schwartzeneger makes for a horrible Mr. Freeze. I understand Schumacher wanted a chiseled man for the part, but Arney just isn't the man for the job, especially if his dialogue consists entirely of ice puns and cheapens the character, especially after a stunning revision in the animated series. Uma Thurman plays Poison Ivy and she's really over the top with the role, which some might find detracting, but she looked like she had fun. The writing is truly the film's biggest handicap. As I always say, you can have an all-star cast who've proved to be competent actors in other movies, but give them a crappy script and they'll suffer, even if they're doing their best to make it work, they're going to suffer greatly. That's the case here. The cast is already a mixed bag as I mentioned before, but with a godawful script, it's no wonder why some of the delivery is the way it is. Now all of this said and done, is this the worst comic movie ever? No, there are plenty of more obscure flops that make this look like a Christopher Nolan movie, but it is the worst Batman movie (Unless you count Catwoman). It's not the biggest cinematic abomination either, but if you take into account that another Batman movie wouldn't come for another 8 years and the fact the movie seemed to have killed light- hearted superhero films, they screwed up somewhere, but I reiterate, it's not the worst failed abortion, but it's still a failed abortion. Watch it with Rifftrax or watch it with friends and riff on it and you'll have the time of your life. Otherwise, unless you want proof that not all nostalgia is good nostalgia, don't watch this.",Batman & Robin
528,Kaserynofthegyre,Oh dear......,2,29 January 1999,"If you have never seen Burton's original and if you thought the 60's TV series was better than the comic then you might, possibly, find something to enjoy here.  If, however, you think Batman should be a shadowy, menacing figure you're going to hate the pantomime caricature that Joel Schumacher has produced.You can't help but sympathise with poor George Clooney who, along with Una Thurman (Poison Ivy) looks embarrassed to be there.  Arnie (Mr Freeze) seems to be able to keep the paycheck in sight and even seems to being enjoying himself, perhaps he's more at ease operating in an artistic vacuum than the others.Visually, it's stunning, and the sound will impress all but the stone deaf, but anybody who wants credibility, a plot, or even a few good one-liners is in for a bitterly grim evening.

If you do decide to go that way, though, you'd think you would at least use camera angles that would not cut off the parts of the action. Most of the sequences were a neon blur. A loud, clumsy, ugly mess. There were too many characters pulled in too many different directions to have a coherent story, and I hate that they made Barbara Alfred's niece instead of Commissioner Gordon's daughter.

Freeze's one liners are great. Poison Ivy, played by Uma Thurman, is a good villian. George Clooney is a better Batman than Val Kilmer, but Chris'O'Donnell stunk in this as Robin.

He is the most pathetic excuse for Batman that Hollywood could have made. I think I could have done a better job than him and I am one crappy actor. Gotham City looks very unrealistic and idiotic. What the hell is with all the tall statues?! I am a big fan of Arnold, but he did not bring out the true Freeze character at all. Could it have been anymore feebleminded when Clooney took out the damn ""Batcard"" and said ""never leave the cave without it?"" I almost threw the DVD out the window after that, but then I remembered I had to bring it back to Blockbuster. Horrible plot, terrible directing, and dumbfounded acting.

Uma Thurman overacted extremely as Poison Ivy. George Clooney was an equally bad Batman. People will complain that Bane is not simply supposed to be a mindless henchman, but I didn't think too much of it, despite the fact that I agree. I liked a couple things about the movie, though.

I have no Idea what they were going for when they made this mess nothing about the movie is good. this could've been saved by a good script and filming in a real city. but for some reason they think that bad one liners and sets built in a garage are cool. I watch this and enjoy it, slightly, because it all fits together most of the film. it's a real eye-sore when watching it since everything is lit with black lights, and maybe one regular stage light. every piece of the set is smothered in neon paint then light when a red neon black light setting one mood throughout the whole film. when it comes to the acting, I don't think they even hired a director because Arnold is the only one in this movie that seems believable. he is good when bad,dry one-liners like ""cool party"" as he exits the ball. but giving them to everyone especially Uma Thurman is what kills the film. I think the only reason they hired her was to have enough big stars for people to think this movie is good. they could've hired a high school freshman in drama club and gotten the same thing. the worst line is the whole film is when Bain punches the wall and Ivy says ""Reinforced steel, not good"". they must've shot the entire freeze breakout of jail scene in one shot. contrary to most opinions I think George Cloony would've been very good, but he as bad direction as everyone else. the only thing that keeps this thing together is Arnold. just hearing his dry humor moves the movie along so that it is slightly enjoyable. when ever the movie is on I flip it on just hoping to hear him say "" A laundry service that delivers....Wow!"" good scripting would've saved this picture. because production costs don't mean anything if got a good script and direction. like Ace Ventura: pet detective. cheap but classic. if you like batman I guess you could give it a shot. but don't think you'll enjoy it much at all.",Batman & Robin

544,bryonyx70,Bob Kane and Bill Finger would roll in their graves...,2,18 July 2010,"Looking back across Batmans publication filmography, through television and cinema, it is really pretty plain to see that this particular movie rivals with the crappy Adam West show of the 60s. However, we can forgive the camp and cheesiness ways of the TV show, as after all, it was created nearly 50 years ago with little access to special effects and a low budget. This movie, on the contrary, didn't have any of those, so in hindsight, it should have been minimally successful. It was not. Firstly, as such a huge comics book fan, admittedly the Batman universe really is my favourite, and a few things have to be specifically addressed. Bane broke Batmans back. In theory, this really does put him up there in the most menacing supervillians, and yet in this he is demolished to a body guard, capable of a few grunts. Ivy is my favourite comic book character ever, and yet Thurman is unsexy, lifeless and insultingly bad at portraying her. Batgirl is equally as lithe, with the 'kick-ass' heroine being none other than our favourite Clueless chick (and I really do stress the word clueless) Alicia Silverstone. No. It does not work.The writers crammed too many superheroes, too many supervillians, and this created a movie with a lot of stuff, with no substance. Nobody gets a real back story, or a decent plot line where we are actually able to connect for more than five seconds, because there's no time, with another 8 main characters to keep up with. When will Hollywood realise this? With all their money and glamour, they thought shoving as much in as possible would create something mildly worth while. Oh, how wrong they were. Another thing, what was with the multicoloured flashing neon lights in EVERY scene??I believe I was going to a movie, not a rave, and the one-liners were just appallingly cringy. I believe at one point Freeze actually describes a party as being 'cool.' Oh no they didn't. So overall, terrible acting, terrible writing, and terrible direction. It all adds up to a big no from me.",Batman & Robin
545,Mattster99,What a let down....,3,9 April 2010,"This film is considered one of the worst movie ever made, it isn't really that awful (but that's my opinion), I'm only saying nice things about this film because, I loved it as a little kid, I would always watch it, it's still pretty bad but, and I consider it one of the corniest films I have ever seen.There's a new villain in Gotham called Mr.Freeze( Arnold Schwarzenegger) who plans on destroying the whole world by creating a new Ice Age, he is joined by Poisen Ivy (Uma Thurman) who also plans on dominating the world except with Mother Nature (plants, flowers,vines etc) and is helped by her assistant Bane (Jeep Swenson) and Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell), and is later joined by Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) to bring down the evil trio.The only good parts were, well, I really can't think of much, but the action was OK, but the dialogue just made them seem really dumb. the acting was horrible especially Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was such an unexpected choice for the character Mr.Freeze, George Clooney was OK as Bruce Wayne, but had some pretty horrible lines as Batman, Chris O'Donnell was much more cornier in this than he was in ""Batman Forever"", Alicia Silverstone was annoying and boring as Batgirl, with even more cornier lines than Chris O'Donnell's lines, Jeep Swenson was stupid as Bane, like really stupid.I'm guessing that Joel Schumacher really tried to make this good and entertaining, but he really went down-hill with ""Batman Forever"", so he wasn't expected to do any good. A lot more fans were let down by this Film, and as I got older, and grew more mature, I realized that this film really was awful, but I still like it a bit, I would also like to add that Batman mentioned Superman in the film, seriously, I'm not joking. Robin: ""I wish I had a car!"", Batman: Glares at him. Robin: ""Chicks dig the car!"". Batman: ""This is why Superman work's alone"".

""Batman & Robin"" is supposedly a homage to the 60's Batman television series, but ""Batman & Robin"" is missing something that the television series had: charm. The (unfunny) one-liners and campiness come so fast in this film that the action takes a backseat to them. The performances in this film are a complete mess. George Clooney isn't playing Batman; George Clooney is playing George Clooney playing Batman. Not once does George Clooney feel like he's playing the Dark Knight. He's just the suave jerk he usually is. Chris O'Donnell seems like he's in a completely different movie. All he ever does is whine and act like an angst-ridden 13 year old. Arnold Schwarznegger's performance is easily the worst. He only exists to make unfunny ice puns and chew the scenery like no other, yet this film expects us to both sympathize and fear this character? Uma Thurman's, in of her few bad performances, gives a performance which is so hammy and over the top that John Lithgow would tell her to tone it down. Although, I have to give her some credit though as she seems to be the only actor having fun with her role in this film. Alicia Silverstone's performance isn't terrible, but she feels miscast as Batgirl. She doesn't really have the tough-girl personality of the comic book's vision of Batgirl. Visually, this film is spectacular. Gotham City has a marvelous design similar to the era of German expressionism and the works of F.W. Murnau.

In the process he made Batman a light-hearted skinny wimp in a latex costume; Robin an egocentric wannabe teenager; Bane, originally the man who broke the bat - who with his intellectual and physical prowess out matches the batman, into a brainless goof of a henchman with a gimp mask who idiotically grunts and goes ""Baaaane"" all the time.This approach works until it doesn't, which is to say the entire length of the movie. Had it been another character (Daredevil for example) or had this been an entirely new hero ensemble, or had this been a purely children's movie like the spy-kids; this movie would have worked with its ridiculous amounts of puns and juvenile action sequences. But this is the Dark Knight. A character through the course of time has evolved in to a character with immense depth, one of the darkest and most intriguing characters of all time. He is an anti-hero who is tormented by his past and struggles to keep the beast within him at bay. Joel Schumacher's attempt to make him in to a ""Light Knight"" means that he has to betray the very essence and the very core of the ""Dark Knight"". And in this process he destroys the Batman and all his surrounding characters.On a closing note, I believe Joel Schumacher did an experiment. Granted an experiment which failed miserably, but then again that is how experiments work...",Batman & Robin
549,Climinator,Batman & Robin,3,5 February 2013,"Back in 1989 a comic book-based film starring Michael Keaton took the world by storm. That film was called 'Batman'. The reason why it was such a blockbuster was because it defied having any of the humour the 60's show had. In place it returned the dark and Gothic noir Batman's world originally had. Three sequels later and the franchise has been killed by a change of directors and almost the entire cast (Michael Gough and Pat Hingle were the only two actors to have roles in all four movies). Wheras the original had a decent, if flawed, plot this third sequel is just flawed in so many ways. An example of this is very early on when Batman and Robin fight against Mr Freeze in the opening sequence. In the scene Batman and Robin bash their boots together to unleash their ice skates. Seeing as they were equipping their costumes before they were told that the villain was calling them self 'Mr Freeze' how did they know they would need them? Another plot hole is when Batman, Robin and Batgirl suddenly have a drastic costume change without any explanation (in the graphic novel of the film the white bits are meant to shield them from Freeze rays so why a line for this explanation wasn't put in the film escapes me). There's even a sequence where Batman and Robin start betting over Poison Ivy and Batman uses a credit card with an expiry date saying 'Forever'. The film is that awful in continuation of what Keaton and Burton started. Whilst Batman Returns was a bit too dark and Tim Burton-like, this is too far the opposite way. Turning Batman and Robin into a couple of stereotypical comedic tough talking cop characters doesn't make any of the humour funny. It makes it stale and annoying, very quickly. It's a shame that the film ended up the way it did as it had a talented cast. With Arnold Schwartzenegger, Uma Thurman, George Clooney, Chris 'O' Donnell and Alicia Silverstone I often wonder what the film could've been like if Tim Burton had been involved. Instead you have a film filled with bad liners and visual gags, cheap sets and horrible glaring lights when the character lives in a dark and gloomy city. The only way it is slightly more watchable, I find, is if you ignore this one being a part of the 80's-90's franchise and is instead a sequel/reboot of the 60's TV series/film as it has more to do with that Batman era.Other than that AVOID!!!",Batman & Robin
550,realhiphop,Excellent fun entry into the series - B& R rocks!,10,3 May 2005,"I saw this film a couple of times when it played cinemas June 1997 and actually had the pleasure of meeting George Clooney when he came to Australia for the premiere at Planet Hollywood Melbourne ( now defunct restaurant). Batman 1, Burton's Batman will always be the best, except perhaps for Begins ! However, compared to Forever, this is a much better film. Yes its campy in bits ( thats Schumacher's gay influence), yes most of Arh-nuld's lines are one liners and get annoying, however the action was good, the colours vibrant, and there is actually numerous witty lines throughout the film, and some strong acting by Clooney, O'Donnell , hingle and support.This is Definitely not the worst movie ever, and should not be in the bottom 100. There are plenty of worse films for that. ( Amityville remake was a disappointment, as was xXx 2, Tomb Raider 1, AvP and more , but i cant be bothered thinking... you get my point.I would really rate this about a 7.5/10, however, due to the ridiculous low scores of others, i have over rated to make up for it..My kids will love it in years to come, as a 19 year old when i saw it in 1997 i had fun, and saw myself as a kid again... Big sets, big colours, big musical score and action set pieces, its definitely worthy of a look if you haven't seen it...And a flop people say??107 million Us box office 130 million non USA box office$59 million in US video/DVD rentals & sales$70 million in non-Us video/DVD sales & rentals-------- $ 366 world wide total income, not bad for a flop! -----------PS> the reason i think Schumacher & the studio went lighter & humour for B& R was because Forever was so successful and was already heading down the campy/fun path, so when its popular, they followed the trend, obviously too much..At least this didn't have tommy lee jones, he was the worst over acted batman villain ever, when people wake up to this the better...And it had Aussie Elle MacPherson in B&R - how could you go wrong?Dan",Batman & Robin

I loved the casting and loved george clooney's style as both bruce wayne and batman. But it was seeing all these other actors as well that really made the movie so great. The almost overly comfortable roles they filled felt very much as the original vision seen in the 1960's Batman TV series which was something I felt was a true resemblance as batman and how he should be portrayed. Batman was originally created as a superhero icon for children and comic book readers as a part of story time, and has since been changed to a sort of ""serious suspense and too ""realistic"" adult entertainment. I much preferred the more ""comic"" and childlike entertainment that batman and robin was.

It was unimaginable how a next movie could be even more insulting to the Batman universe. well, the certainly managed.  Somehow. I wonder if the actors (Thurman, Schwarzenegger, whoever played Bane) realize that they looked like complete imbeciles?  And let's not start on the dialogue.Usually, in cases where other aspects of the film are lacking (in this case, everything), you'll find  eye-candy in terms of crowd-pleasing action scenes, and fun fights.  Unfortunately, Schumacher demonstrated that he had no idea what he was doing, and he couldn't even pull THAT off.  I don't think the camera manages to keep up with what's going on.  God knows I couldn't.  They would've fared better with a giant penguin doing the camerawork.But you know what? Overall, I recommend this to anyone.  I couldn't stop laughing throughout.

It is the movie about Batman and Robin.""Batman and Robin"" is the fourth movie in the series, in which Batgirl meets and joins up with Batman and Robin. Being the fourth movie, it is a natural for the title Batman 4ever.So, it is clear that the producers have no idea what they are doing when simply titling their films. That leaves me wondering what they were thinking when they came up with this plot.Two women, Batgirl and Poison Ivy, cause trouble for the dynamic duo by, um, by being women? You see, in this film the main problem is that the superheros have trouble controlling their superhero testosterone. Can you blame a couple guys that run around in rubber suits all night with finely detailed abs and nipples. I noticed that they put a lot of effort into defining every muscle except one.The plot is bad. The acting is bad. Arnold refuses to play a real bad guy.

558,TomAyles,Joel Schumaker destroys the Batman movie franchise.,2,26 April 2001,"This movie has no redeeming qualities.  It takes everything that was bad about Batman Forever (an okay, but not particularly good movie) and makes it worse.  The first Tim Burton Batman movie had one hero (Batman), one love interest (Vickie Vale), and one villain (The Joker).  Batman Returns had one hero, and two villains, one of which doubled as the love interest.  Batman Forever had two heros (Batman and Robin), two villains (Two Face and The Riddler) and one love interest (Dr. Chase Meridian).  As the number of main characters increased, the ability to develop those characters (much less any meaningful plot) decreased.  So, what does Schumaker do in his (hopefully) final interpretation of Batman?  He has three heros (Batman, Robin, and Batgirl), two villains (Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy), and a love interest (Julie Madison)!!!The movie had potential, since both Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy are great villains who have been portrayed very well in both the comics and the animated series.  And the inclusion of Bane and Jason Woodrue held potential for playing major roles in future movies.  Similarly, Julie Madison's appearance was a great touch aimed at the die-hard comics fans -- I don't believe she has appeared in the comics since 1939.  But the potential was wasted by a director more interested in flash, camp, and puns than in producing anything true Batman fans want.",Batman & Robin

And in the most severe case of miscasting I've ever seen, Clooney is simply tragic as Batman. The new villains aren't up to much either. Uma Thurman's 'Poison Ivy' is completely over the top and seemed to come out of nowhere. Scwartznegger's 'Mr freeze' possibly has the worst dialogue I've ever heard from a character in a movie, with many 'memorable' lines such as ""Ice to see you"" and ""Always winterize your pipes"". Clever? Not one bit.All in all, the only thing that made this movie remotely watchable was the touching performance from the old guy who played Albert. But nothing else.

563,suntorytime10,Oh the HUMANITY!!!!!,1,29 February 2004,"How can a former hairstylist be given the job of directing a Batman flick? Oh, we want to move into a more kid-friendly, merchandise money grabbing direction with the Bat flicks. We want it to be accessible to all. Accessible to all?! Please, what do Warner's take us for. Now, I'm not the most ardent of Batman fans when it comes to knowing the ins and outs of the Dark Knight, but even little old me can see that handing over responsibility to a clueless director with no vision, no passion and no clue is insane. But then to let him bring back the style of the 60's TV show into a $100 million summer event film is beyond even the reaches of the Almighty himself. How something as riveting and brilliant as the stories of the Batman can be turned into a puerile, turgid and utterly sickening campfest of bright colours and horrid one-liners is unbelievable. Now to be fair, the cast aren't the main culprits here, but surely they must have known what they were letting themselves in for. Did none of them think that there careers could be severely dented, if not ended my this monstrosity? Obviously not. But the monstrosity of a script gives none of them any time to stretch their acting muscles for even a brief moment. I thought George Clooney was a great choice for Bruce Wayne, but he's just too nice, too charming and boyish to be Batman. Plus he looks completely out of place in the costume. The other half of the Dynamic Duo is again filled by Chris O' Donnell, who although has very limited acting ability anyway, is forced to again play Robin as the same whinging as in Batman Forever. Alicia Silverstone suffers the most, her role as Batgirl/Barbara is nonexistent, forced to sit and watch from afar for the most part, reduced to inconsequential scenes with Alfred and a over-cooked, horribly orchestrated bike-race. Until, good old uncle Alf has a suit ready for her, in her size and everything, and joins the Bat-family. Bless. As for the villains, Schwarzenegger and Thurman are good sports, hamming up each off their roles to the fullest, though I'd play along if I was given $30 million for just 6 weeks work. Thurman meanwhile, is actually rather good as Poison Ivy, villainous and curvaceous in equal measure, she is the flower among the weeds, and manages to retain her dignity, while others have already withered and died. But the sole blame of the disastrous result of a film falls squarely with Schumacher. His insistence all things camp, excessive and over-the-top have, in the space of two films, turned Batman from dark, brooding keeper of justice into an at times laughable, unconvincing  and childish superhero.Schumacher's appreciation of the Batman is non-existent, he grasps on the ideals and themes of why and how this billionaire playboy could become a dark, vengeful superhero, not a loveable kids toy are lost in a pool of 1960's excess and camp one-liners, all of which just reiterate the fans disgust at this film. Schumacher's not helped at all by the horrid script by Akiva Goldsman, who recently won an Oscar would you believe. It's a clunky, horrifically saturated, nauseating  film. Yes, the set-pieces and design are top-notch, but are still nowhere near the kind of world Batman should be inhabiting. Who honestly wants to see a neon-filled ice-cream factory or a city filled with row upon row of red, blue, green and yellow. If this is your idea of the brooding, narcissistic world of Batman, then Mr. Schumacher I think you should think about reinventing Rainbow, not messing with the world's most treasured superhero.  And putting nipples on the Batman and Robin Bat-suits was I think the kick in the teeth the Bat fans needing to demand changes. Demand that Warners get there act together, demand that the next film, if ever there will be one (Which there is!) was treated with the respect and the intelligence that a legendary 60 year old plus comic book hero deserves.

Although the previous one is still the best of the four. The only low point i could find was that the plot jumps quickly from one point to another without any explanation. Otherwise, everything else was great. George Clooney played a different kind of Bruce Wayne/Batman..a more lighthearted, smiling guy. Honestly, I found he was good...then again George Clooney could just stand there and he'd make me swoon. Chris O'Donnell was also great in his reprise as Robin, and I enjoyed him a lot. I loved the brotherly dynamic between the two characters that was shown in this film.Alicia Sylverstone was also good as batgirl, although if she wasn't there, it wouldn't have made a difference. But she was, so basing my review off of that, she did her role well.The two villains were very entertaining. I loved Uma Thurman's poison ivy, and I found her to be highly entertaining. Her powder became annoying after a little bit, though. Also, Arnold's Freeze was very good. Yes, he had some corny lines, and yes he was a little creepy looking, but overall he was very convincing as a villain and actually provided a challenge for the protagonists (unlike the other bad guys we've seen). His backstory, about trying to find the cure for his ailing wife, was very emotional as well.Overall, as I've said for the past movies, do NOT listen to the critiques and base your interest off of that.

567,rabol,Why ?,1,2 August 2005,"I've spent years trying to figure out why this movie is what it is. Joel Schumacher, the director of the movie, already made one attempt at directing a bat film and while it wasn't anything special, many people, including me, agree it was fairly decent. I would never expect the sequel to be such a complete disaster. Why did it go this way ? I'm not sure actually. At one point i honestly suspected that he (Schumacher) simply decided to play a prank on everyone who was to his disturbingly horrible creation. I've also suspected that maybe he was under the influence of narcotics or alcohol. Maybe he went insane. I just don't know. But I do know this : no matter what you do, no matter what your profession is, when you start working on a project based on a particular subject, you make sure you have enough knowledge on that subject and that you understand it. Joel Schumacher did not have to be an expert on comics. All he had to do was to do a little bit of research, get the titles of books that capture the essence of the character in the best way, and then simply read those books. Yeah, i know, it's crazy to assume that an experienced director wouldn't do at least a small research on what he was working on - but I really don't think he did ! I honestly think he approached the subject with only the basic knowledge figuring that will be enough. Bruce Wayne dresses up as a Bat to fight crime because his parents had been murdered when he was a child. That's it. I'm really sure this is all he knows about Batman. I'm sure, because there is no way in hell he would produce THIS if he knew more. And being a huge Batman fan since i can remember, what he produced insulted me. It made me feel embarrassed. It made me feel violated. It made me feel ashamed and stupid. I can't explain why. It wasn't my fault, I didn't make this movie, yet i couldn't force myself to admitting in front of anyone who saw this garbage that I am a fan of Batman. Mr.Schumacher insulted and disrespected every comic book fan, every comic book creator who ever worked on ""Batman"" and he insulted Bob Kane himself by turning his creation into this. But that's my point of view. This is from a perspective of a long time Batman fan. What about regular moviegoers ? What did they receive for their money ? Horrible acting not just by Ah-nuld, but by someone like Uma Thurman as well, who has a reputation of being a good actress. Dumb duologue aimed directly at 3 year olds constructed mainly from ridiculous one-liners, even more ridiculous plot that makes you wonder if it was written by a 10 year old. What else ? Well, there's a fair amount of pure uncut stupidity. Stupidity in it's purest form. Take this scene for an example : Robin smashes through a thick museum door on his motor bike making a hole in it, being completely intact. Sounds stupid, right ? Keep reading. The hole turns out to have a perfect shape of a Robin logo. That's right ! It's THAT stupid ! And on top of all that....you know what ? To hell with it. I'm not going to finish this review.

571,chvideo,Injustice to the Batman franchise,2,12 January 1999,"Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman franchise with this campy recreation of the film version of Batman that Tim Burton brought us.  I could barely stand his ""Batman Forever"" and this film was even worse. The dialogue was tired, the action was completely unbelievable, the sets were more like a circus than Gotham interiors/exteriors, and Clooney couldn't play the tortured duality of Batman to save his life.  As if that weren't bad enough, Bruce's flashbacks were merely trivial--a poor attempt to keep continuity within the series of movies.  Someone's going to have to tell me how this one ended, because during the scene when both Batman and Robin are in Ivy's hideout and Robin is struggling to get out of the water, I had to turn it off.  Why Schumacher decided it was a good idea to reverse the film in this shot is beyond me.  Joel, don't insult my intelligence.....",Batman & Robin
572,sticky-4,Why it sucked,1,10 November 1998,"OK let's break this down to why Batman and Robin failed so miserably.10. Batman: Clooney isn't that bad, but it would have helped if he played the character as more brooding and darker.9. Robin: Chris Odonnel is too old and too tall for this part.  Dick Grayson was never this immature in the comics.8. Batgirl: The character had no reason for being in this movie, it was as if they finished writing it (writing?) and someone said let's put batgirl in this, just...add her in tagging along after the heroes.  And she's not Alfred's neice, she's Commisioner Gordon's daughter.  (Hey Joel, try reading a comic before you make a movie based on that comic)7. Mr. Freeze: Arnold wasn't that bad, but let's face it, hundreds of one-liner-cold-puns will kill anyone's career.6. Poison Ivy: Uma I thought could act, but this role was so ridiculous, and so were her outfits, they looked like they came right out of the 60's.  And when she rose (or grew) from the ground and immediatley knew what forign chemicals were running thru her system was laughable.5. Bane: Let's see, in the comic he is a veritable Dr. Moriarty to Batman's Sherlock Holmes, in the movie he was some dumb shmuck, (like the people who paid to see this) Jeep Swenson (R.I.P.) looks too bulky for the part, Arnold would have been much better in this role.4. The soundtrack: what soundtrack, they spent all their money on stars and special effects so they just used Goldenthal's soundtrack from Batman Forever.3. Alfred: Was he dying from sickness, or just trying to die.  Since when would he know how to program his brain algorithms into the batcomputer, how would he know her exact measurements, and if he knew Batgirl was going to discover the secret, why not just tell her.2. The production: THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF IT.  All the stunts looked fake, especially at the start when robin burst thru the window on his motorcycle and it just...floats to the ground.  By the way how many times are we going to see a superhero drop in thru a skylight.1. Joel Shumacher: he said Batman should be over his grief of the death of his parents and therefore a little more light hearted ... of course if BATMAN ever was over that, he would stop being BATMAN, that's the only reason he does what he does is because of his grief.Gotham City has become such a colorful and happy place to live now.  I swear I was expecting Aunt Harriett Cooper to pop out someplace in the mansion and offer them milk and cookies.  Every few minutes, I found myself looking away and saying ""I...I can't belive it's this bad.""  When BATMAN came out, it was great, when RETURNS came out,I had mixed feelings about it, when FOREVER came out I thought it made RETURNS look so good by comparison, now AND ROBIN comes out and it actually makes FOREVER look good.  Let's just hope that WB learns their lesson...But I doubt it.",Batman & Robin
573,sambuca,I just watched it for the first time today and...,7,9 April 2006,"(SHOCK! HORROR!) I found it quite impressive. Firstly I need to clarify I loved the Tim Burton version of Batman; it managed to do away with much of the campiness of the Adam West TV series, yet still stayed true to its intention of being an ENTERTAINING flick. Furthermore it brought back much of the dark, moody atmosphere of the comics without descending to the yawn-fest that was Batman Beyond. If ""dark and brooding"" equals ""boring"" to today's Hollywood, perhaps they need to take a lesson from the original Batman movie franchise. And now to Batman & Robin. After hearing, many years ago, the unfavourable reviews of critics (you know, that bunch who think they know everything about film and try to tell us what we should watch) I approached this film with pretty low expectations. And yes, this film is far from perfect (Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl? Big mistake, and poorly written into the script) but manages follow closely into Tim Burton's vision. Action aplenty, Alfred becomes an integral part of the proceedings again (unlike the third movie) and finally there are villains to relish watching: Schwarzenegger and Thurman are clearly enjoying themselves, with plenty of snappy one-liners and none of the overacting of Nicholson & Carrey. Arnold especially is superb (I never thought a day would come when I'd say this...) as Dr Freeze, with the ending revealing perhaps the only Batman villain that we could actually care for, unlike the one-dimensional caricatures that were Joker & Co. - Spiderman 2's Dr. Octopus looks like he has taken more than a leaf out of his book in his final act redemption. And so, Batman & Robin is a winner in my book; two hours of solid action and entertainment, and it may be no Citizen Kane, but then neither were the previous three films and neither were they meant as such in the first place. Rating: 7/10 Finally having seen all Batman films to date, my order of preference is now: 1. Batman Returns 2. Batman and Robin 3. Batman 4. Batman Begins 5. Batman Forever",Batman & Robin
574,Raven-149,Better that Batman Returns,6,31 May 1999,"So what if the actors are spitting out one-liners and Mr. Freezes ice gun effects look plastic and cheap? The movie is still pretty entertaining despite some pathetic attempts at emotion. Not nearly as good as ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman"" but it's good fun if you're in the mood for more mindless action.",Batman & Robin
575,fishpoo,Misunderstood,5,26 January 2004,"I have seen Batman & Robin many times and that should show that it's not really all that bad.The biggest problem with this film is that most people misunderstood it. After Tim Burton's very dark Batman films, no one would expect this. The style is completely different and instead of being dark, everything is very colorful. It's more like the 60s TV show. If this had been a movie by its self and not a sequel, maybe people wouldn't hate it so much.Another flaw is the new character Batgirl. I will never understand why she was created. She serves no purpose and her costume looks cheap. Robin turning up in the last movie was bad enough.A good thing this movie has is Mr. Freeze. In my opinion he is the best of Batman's villains. He is cool (Haha), likable, funny, has character and doesn't just run around laughing like the previous villains. Poison Ivy however was nothing special.George Clooney is not Batman. He can play Bruce Wayne, but when he's wearing the bat suit he just looks like George Clooney dressed up as Batman. It looks silly. Maybe it's just the new suit. Robin's suit also looks rather silly, but it looks better than the suit he wore in the 60s. When Batman and Robin are standing next to each other at parties or crime scenes and they are not fighting, they look ridiculous. I just thought I'd point that out.My conclusion is that this film deserves at least 5 out of 10. That's not great, but better than what a lot of people say. It's an entertaining film that should not be a sequel. Nothing more, nothing less.",Batman & Robin

578,iscariot-1,Joel Schumacher has killed his career,2,27 January 2007,"Joel Schumacher has NEVER been able to direct a reasonable film. You can blame Clooney and Goldsman all you want, but at least he has some chops. It was Joel Schumacher's call to move away from the dark and foreboding presence and replace it with the crap video feel of so many of his other duds have had. He single-handedly destroyed Phantom, Phone Booth, and turned Veronica Guerin from what should have been an Oscar winning role for Kate Blanchett into a complete failure.His next target is the movie 23. Fortunately this has a very strong script and a good cast. Hopefully the producers will reign in his music-video style and make that film a good watch.",Batman & Robin
579,madmax007,Big Budget Film Camps It Up,1,9 June 2008,"No one cant take this film seriously you cant take the premise characters who are not the slightest believable or the whole idea seriously. Instead you watch a film that nearly destroyed one of Hollywood's greatest film franchises so I guess It's good for one thing Historical Value that a film this bad should not be replicated just a warning to anyone that doesn't want their film career destroyed . If you want to laugh at something so appalling than this film is for you because this might make the perfect dark comedy. The whole plot line was created to appeal to children but adults don't want to bring their kids to something as DE-educating as this. The plot is much of a throwback as the theme is to the 1960's TV-Series with Adam West this time in the serious dark times of the 1990's. The plot focuses on Batman and Robin who meet up with a new enemy Mr.Freeze who like any other enemy has the potential to take over Gotham City and the world like that hasn't happened before. Mr.Freeze appears to be to much of a match for Batman so he creates ""Freezesuits"" supposedly to keep them from freezing from the ice. They are joined by Barbara Gordon who is a college drop-out joins them on their adventures of mediocrity. They also joined by second villain Poison Ivy who is able to seduce men through her charm. Eventually they save the day through the most ridiculous plot line imaginable. This lets you know that you can tell that a lot of this even the cast does not take seriously. The whole plot line is a joke that should've never been token to Hollywood standards. This whole problem started according to Joel Schumacher when the toy companies pressured him to create an family friendly atmosphere for his next Batman project because otherwise the toy companies wouldn't want to be involved with it if it had been similar to Batman Returns or Forever, but don't be just angry at Schumacher Warner.Bros went along with this disaster as well. In fact they were probably more involved with the appeal and theme of the film than Schumacher. One could note that it was a group effort as to why the film turned out the way it did. Just avoid the film everyone who was involved with it wants to avoid it ruined Alicia Silverstone's and Chris O Donnell's film careers George Clooney will agree to pay anyone who payed to see the film. So why bother to even pay to go see it in the first place.",Batman & Robin
580,WhatsYourPoint,Ad nauseam...,2,17 July 2006,"Do I have to remind anyone about how crappy Batman & Robin is? Good, I didn't think so, but I will anyway. This movie is ruined not only by its stupid ideas, but the sheer number of times they are put into practice! The Batman series declined ever since Batman Returns in 1992, but I didn't think that it would go this far! Where to start? I guess the ludicrous script is the first stepping-stone in attacking this pure dreck. Akiva Goldsman (who won an Oscar for A Beautiful Mind, go figure) penned a screenplay that consists of the most one-liners in the history of cinema! Between Mr. Freeze's constant jokes about ice, freezing, cold, and winter, and Robin's ridiculous ""witty"" observations, there is no better movie that showcases the beauty of one-liners! Next I'll tackle the story (or lack thereof). Batman & Robin is laden with plot holes and illogical plot points. Mr. Freeze turning a telescope into a giant freezing gun? Tell me more! Why doesn't anyone guard themselves from Poison Ivy's intoxicating mist? Don't you think Batman and Robin would realize this after the third time she's blown that ""love-powder"" in their faces? Freeze and Ivy's alliance makes no sense because they both have completely conflicting interests! Freeze wants to cause a new ice-age, while Ivy wants her plants to overthrow humanity and thrive in a new-world order. Last time I checked, plants don't survive to well in a harsh winter, but maybe I'm just an idiot.The characters are campy and stupid. Poison Ivy is always talking and revealing her plans, even when someone (like a cop) is right beside her. Freeze (played ""amiably"" by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a terrible villain who's only purpose is to annoy the audience. Bane: what in God's name is this? Robin is ungrateful and a nuisance, complaining to Bruce Wayne all the time (and this is the man who buys his things and takes care of him). Batman is corny because of George Clooney's delivery, but he is fine as Wayne. Batgirl is the ""tough-as-nails"" chick, but just comes off as a jerk.I could go on about how bad this movie is: bad acting, directing, writing (especially), action, etc. If it's so bad, then why only a 2 rating and not a 1? Well, I must admit some sets are pretty and there are some good colors. Plus, Joel Schumacher's second Batman doesn't get boring because watching this ""movie"" dissolve into drivel provides some entertainment. And if nothing else, you'll be quoting the one-liners for days on end! Alas, Batman & Robin is a sad entry into the Batman anthology, but fortunately it is the last one (Begins is the first one in a hopefully much better saga).",Batman & Robin
581,natebridgeman,"Joel, you where possessed when you made this film",1,5 August 2013,"This movie SUCKS!!!!!! The entire film is just one two and a half hour toy commercial. It's possibly the worst film of all time with over the top action sequences, ridiculous costumes and make-up, effect that were obviously drawn on paper, just plain terrible acting, everyone wanting to punch robin in the face 700 times, and most of all, 65% of the entire movie is just plain one-liners. There is just plain nothing I love about about this movie. It makes every other bad movie look like a masterpiece. Don't even waste your time like I did. If you want to live a happy life on earth. This movie not only killed the Batman franchise for 8 years, but it also killed superhero movies for 4 years. George Clooney is the worst batman ever!!!!!!!

582,luket,A misguided director attempts to kill Batman by making one of the most disgraceful films ever produced.,1,20 April 2009,"I am HUGE Batman fan and was borderline aroused by Tim Burton's Gothic depiction of Batman. I am not a comics person but I loved how Burton handles such a dark and complex individual. Coupled with some awesome casting (most notably big Jack who has more charisma than I dare try to quantify) the films have a truly universally appeal.Enter Joel Schumacher.... I believe the conversation went something like this: Producers: Hi Joel, Batman is arguably the most interesting comic book character and we have made two really good Batman films. We have decided to contractually release the actors and director who made this franchise so good. Is there any chance you can make a bad Batman film and then follow it up with a film so stinking that it could kill the franchise forever.Joel: Not a problem. Do you mind if I waste a lot of your money in the process and try and destroy some acting careers as well? Producer: Why not? Fill your boots Joel.Now I am not going to even try and talk about the lack of artistic integrity in relation to the comic books, I am merely interested in relating how utterly atrocious this film is.I am truly amazed that so many successful actors signed on to make this film, regardless of how much money they were paid. It is sooooooo excruciatingly bad that when I went to my local video store to buy the Burton films there was a box set of all 4 films for a cheaper price than the first two individually. I decided I would rather spend more money than own this film. In hindsight I realised that the box set was cheaper because you would have to pay someone to take Batman and Robin out of your shop.Please for the love of God do not watch this movie, even if you are being paid to. I was genuinely angry that any actor, director or producer would allow this film to be made, given that it does not stand alone but is part of a franchise.On the plus side, it was the production and circulation of this film that ensured that the franchise was reinvented some time later. I will, however, never forgive Joel Sh**macher for p***ing on Tim Burton and his hard, artistically excellent film making.Shame on everyone concerned with the making of this film. It is without question a urine-soaked abomination of a movie.",Batman & Robin
583,RobTheConqueror,The superhero genre dies in this hysterical mess,3,20 January 2016,"By 1997 it was impossible to look at comic book movies as anything but pure trash. The memories of the first two Superman movies, the first two Batman movies and The Crow were long gone, replaced by shiny, OTT messes like Batman Forever and Judge Dredd. And in 1997 the genre hit an all time low. First with Steel, and of course Batman and Robin.Where do you start? Batman Forever wasn't particularly good but it felt like it was getting there sometimes. This movie is an irredeemable travesty where just about everything goes wrong.The acting: George Clooney as Batman is just.....wrong. While he makes for a perfect Bruce Wayne (as many have pointed out) he is a terrible fit for Batman, completely lacking the presence needed for the role and his line delivery comes across as painfully wooden. And his peers are equally terrible. O'Donnell is once again woeful as Robin and Alicia Silverstone is dreadful as Batgirl. John Glover is ridiculous in an OTT evil scientist role and then finally Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze! Christ, what an awful miscast. The only one who remotely stands out is Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, and of course Gough as Alfred.The plot: Uh......not sure. Or I can't be bothered to remember. Freeze plans to freeze Gotham in ice, Ivy is scheming for something else (Lord knows what) and Batman and Robin fall out after Ivy makes Robin fall in love with her....or something. Also Alfred just happens to have the same disease as Freeze's wife.The characters: Getting back to Arnold as Mr. Freeze, he is dreadfully miscast. They use his tragic backstory from the animated series, but this contrasts completely with the character in the film, which is changed to reflect Arnold's OTT acting style. And what we get is an OTT caricature who makes ice puns EVERY 5 BLOODY MINUTES! The characters of Batman and Robin are also dreadfully wooden by now, and Batgirl is even worse. The character is literally just shoved into the movie for no reason and I can barely even call her a character as she does nothing of note. And as good as Thurman is, the character of Poison Ivy herself starts as ""OTT geek girl"" and then becomes ""mildly annoying temptress"".And apparently Bane is in this movie? What? That screaming, raging, mindless, drug powered henchman is Bane? Coulda fooled me.The campiness: Endless Freeze puns, stupid, exaggerated fight scenes, bat credit card, cringe worthy dialogue, fancy colourful costumes, rubber lips and of course ""so this is where you hang out""So despite this being an irredeemably bad movie, why have I given it a slightly high score of 3/10? Simple. It is so frickin' enjoyable to watch for all the wrong reasons. This is the ""The Room"" of comic book movies, and if given the choice I'd take this over a bad AND incredibly boring movie like X-Men Origins Wolverine.",Batman & Robin
584,TronNorth,Funny in a dumb way,10,14 January 2017,Movie is kinda funny based on they act and the effects of it. Also nobody will ever know cod sure that poison ivy was the one and only reason that ruined batman and Robin. How? Look how mature batman and Robin was in Batman forever and now when poison ivy showed up Robin began acting like weird and wants her leaving get him and batman arguing a lot. Her powers has affected the world pretty much since they fell in love with her too and think she's the only good one on the movie yet she ruined the film. Look how mature batman is in Nolan trilogy why? Because there's no poison to make him argue with people to kiss her. So there it is! Poison ivy ruined batman and Robin and you all think she's the only good thing in the movie? Yup she affected the world and cause then to love her.,Batman & Robin

The casting is terrible. Alicia Silverstone is nothing close to a good actress. Arnold turned Freeze from tragic victim to giggling idiot. Batman, a lonely, tortured individual, is played by George Clooney, who can't help but give a cocky smirk every five minutes of the movie. This film's Batman is more fit to appear in an electric toothbrush commercial than fight crime. Uma Thurman is over the top... WAY over the top. The plot would be enjoyable if 1) Ivy and Freeze didn't team up, as Freeze hardly ever enlists henchmen. He shouldn't join forces with another Rogue. 2) Everything else besides the plot wasn't crap. The acting, production design, puns, humor, and even the sound effects are laughable. Since when does a cartoonish zipping noise sound when Batman punches someone?",Batman & Robin

590,kabeile,a bad joke,1,25 July 2008,"Before I saw this movie I was anxiously waiting for its release. Afterwards I was offended, irritated and angry about, what the director (He Who Must Not Be Named) did to my favorite fictional (comics and literature alike) character.He took this man, haunted by the shooting of his parents, fighting a war against crime, becoming more and more some kind of a borderline/split-personality, trying not to go nuts over his crusade-like task.....and put him into a screwball-Technicolor-musical-comedy-freak-show!!! Nearly everything about this movie was disgusting (for me as a fan of the comic-books). I wouldn't have been surprised if the actors had started singing and if there would have been the old ""Crash"", ""Boom"", ""Bang"" - overlays from the TV-series.The villains - Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and last and also least BANE... I'm really at a loss for words how bad these performances were (written?!?). I expected George Clooney to be the greatest Batman of all times (because of his acting in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) but was also disappointed. This movie is totally crap - from the start to the beginning. Only for kids - not for adults!",Batman & Robin
591,kingcooger,Who gave this the greenlight?,1,21 October 2002,"I have no respect for anyone who calls this a good film.  To begin with we will examine the story.The story tries to tie too many characters together into one plot.  They add Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and Bane all into one.  What's worse is that Bane never gets developed into the truly menacing character he should be.  The story is weak and has no real depth to it.  It's Batman trying to save the city from very straight-forward bad guys.  At least in the first three the bad guys tried to be covert about their evil intentions.Next we will move on to the (shudder) acting.  George Clooney sucks for this role.  His goofy grin constantly overpowers you until you can no longer take this entry seriously (as if you could anyway).  At least Kilmer (who was okay) could make Batman an imposing and dark character (though he was horrible as Bruce Wayne).  Alicia Silverstone offers us nothing but eye candy and no true story.  Chris O'Donnell plays a cheesier version of his character from the last movie.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was horribly mis-cast as the role of Mr. Freeze.  I hated that a big muscley guy was cast to play a whimpy scientist who relies on his gun for power.  Finally, Uma Thurman. I truly feel bad for her after this film.  She did the best with what she had but she wasnt given much to work with.Now onto the sets.  What happened to the dark and leering Gotham presented in the other films?  I will admit ""Forever"" did light the city up a bit but not that greatly.  In this movie you feel as if Gotham was a wonderland.Overall this is a horrible film.  It felt so much different from the other films that they should have never used the Batman name.  I kept expecting to see Adam West in a cameo and have BAM and BIFF appear across the screen. Sad that they squandered what could have been good (with a different screenplay, Tim Burton back on board, less characters, and NO Clooney or Arnold).

The third slipped a bit, in spite of (or perhaps because of) a cast apparently constructed with hamming it up in mind.  Of all the films this one had the best cast for building a really good film on.  Unfortunately the script, the over-egged location effects, not to mention a plot that lacks much in the way of continuity or sense, all combine to make for a completely dreadful, but expensive, failure.Movies, on the whole, depend on the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief. Batman Forever strained the limits, but this film breaks them beyond repair.It's a shame because, given a better movie, George Clooney could quite possibly have been the best Batman yet.

He put his own stank on it but everything in his Bat movies has precedent in previous bat-media, comics, tv, and movies. The problem with his portrayal of Batman is that it makes no effort to make him look cool and his fans feel cool by association. People liken it to a funhouse mirror reflection of Batman, bit it's not a funhouse mirror it's one of those magnifying mirrors that shows you all the flaws and disgusting pores in your face. It's completely disrespectful and completely accurate. No one acts particularly out of character aside from bane, Batman actually behaves like a hero and the plot is pretty consistent with itself and as far as I remember doesn't break its own rules. The absurd over the top camp (if that's what you want to call it) was even toned down SIGNIFICANTLY from Batman Forever, and there are a lot of genuinely funny moments.The problem is comic book characters are inherently silly, their plots are more often than not, absurd, with awkwardly over sexualized characters.

600,Dude123,Terrible interpretation of Batman,1,10 February 1999,"First of all, the movie has the worst casting job I have ever seen.  George Cloony doesn't even disguise his voice as Batman and uses the same phrases and words.  Like instead of saying ""Yes"", he says, ""Yes, it did"" or ""Yes, he did"".  Small I know but it gives him away.  Poison Ivy is 6 feet tall and it shows regardless of Joel Schumacher's attempt to cover it up.  Mr. Freeze is apparently a comic now and his ""cold heart"" he made his trademark seems to ""warm up"" in the end (an obvious incosistency).  ""Gothic"" City is no longer gothic.  Instead, it looks like the New Tomorrowland at Disneyland with all the neon.  The holes for Batman, Robin, and Batgirl's eyes are so big, you can surely tell they used black makeup to cover it up.  Robin can hold on to a rocket going 20,000 MPH with his bare hands then can actually breathe in space then can fall miles and land perfectly softly.  Batman carries a CREDIT CARD now!  Tim Burton added depth and art to each of the movies.  In Batman Forever he added a lot of *new* things like the Batmobile's ability to turn a 180 when it's stopped, its abiltiy to slim itself down, and the 'smart' boomerang that hits only the bad guys.  Joel Schumacher doesn't do anything new except add another Batperson to take away from the movie's horrible story again.  Tim Burton had an eerie atmosphere that fit perfectly with the series.  Joel Schumacher seems to be obsessed with colorful cheery scenes with no atmosphere, depth, or art whatsoever.  Also, Danny Elfman did wonders with the music in the first and second one but now that he doesn't do new stuff, Joel Schumacher just uses the same old tired Batman Forever music.  Batgirl has no place in the movie she just suddenly appears for absolutely no reason.  To make matters even worse, she wears a tiny mask and has her long blond hair showing so it's way too obvious it's Alicia Silverstone.  Bain was so pillowy I couldn't tell if they wanted the audience to think he was muscular or just fluffy.  It would be a good movie to laugh at (not with it) but the jokes are so corny it makes you stop laughing at it all together!  Boy do I miss Tim Burton and Batman I & II. Do NOT go see this movie.",Batman & Robin
601,MikeChm,This is the worst of the Batman movies.,1,26 October 1998,"This movie was absolutely horrible.  Someone needs to tell the writers, and directors, that it is not the 1960's any longer.  Batman is not like the 60's series in the comic books anymore.  The character has been radically different since the 1970's. They would improve the series greatly if they concentrated on the detective aspects of the Batman character.  I thought the series was getting better after Batman Forever.  Batman, the first movie, was alright, not great.  Batman Returns was horrible , only slightly better than the latest.  Batman Forever at least tried for some character development.  Batman & Robin was all flash and dash, and every character was made into a farce.  The only good parts were in Wayne Manor when the characters were not in costume.  If they can't do any better than this, they should give up.",Batman & Robin
602,corrupt08,A travesty,4,15 April 2000,"So many things weren't exactly wrong, but misused in this movie.  The most glaringly of those mistakes is the misuse of the Bane character.  For those who don't follow the comic, Bane is the only character ever to end Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, though it was temporary.  Bane was smart enough to know how to weaken the Dark Knight; strong enough to break him in half. Clooney could be an excellent Batman (he's definately better than Kilmer), but he gets lost in the muddled script.  Bane deserves better treatment, and he should not have been included in this flick.  The Batgirl character isn't really necessary, as well as the back story of Alfred's illness.  The campiness, which was almost perfectly used in ""Batman Forever"", was way over the top.  Even Jim Carrey would have a tough time being as cheesy as these guys.  I think the two things that killed this movie were the script and the acting.  While ""Forever"" was cartoonish, the actors who did the hamming (Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones) were good enough to know where to draw the line. Thurman, while a great actress in my eyes, just goes over the top while Arnold...well, Arnold never could act, and he puts any arguements against that case to rest with his performance here.  I still even have reservations about Chris O'Donnell, but he's at least servicable as Robin, were Alicia Silverstone's turn as Batgirl has all of the noteworthy theatrics as ""Clueless"".  I guess that's about how you can sum up this saga of Gotham's Greatest: clueless.  There is one completely redeeming quality, though, one that makes it worth it even as bad as the movie is.  It's still a Batman move.",Batman & Robin

Now let's talk about why this film smells. may contain a *spoiler* or two. One: George Clooney can't act his way out of a paper bag. Two: How Batgirl was brought in was stupid. And she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Three: (yep, you guessed it) Chris O'Donnell couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Four: They tried to kill off Alfred! Five: Poison Ivy was the stupidest villian ever. Six: Most of the dialog stunk on ice. Seven, and my biggest reason for being completely upset with this movie: NO VILLIAN FELL TO THEIR DEATH!!!

606,ramteen89,"It should have been much better, but it still wasn't that bad.",6,7 August 2008,"I can understand fully why moviegoers and critics alike would pan this movie: it departed too much from the original comics. Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight departed a bit as well, but it was made up for (The Dark Knight is by far my favorite).But on the other side, that's what critics are for: to criticise. In my humble opinion, I think that this movie could and should have been much better. I mean, we've all seen Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane on ""Batman: The Animated Series"", which won TWO Emmy Awards. I don't understand why Joel Schumacher couldn't use a touch of ""Heart of Ice"" here, to make Freeze a less campy character and a stronger man. For instance, in the scene where Batman captures Freeze for the first time, they should have had Batman and Freeze fight for a while until Batman broke Freeze's helmet (forcing him to wear nose wires for a while until he got his spare helmet). Poison Ivy, well, she could have been less of a seductress, and Bane should have at least been able to talk and think (like say ""Yes, Madam"" or ""This is reinforced steel. I can't break through this"").On the other hand, it DOES show the side of Freeze where he will do absolutely anything to revive Nora or avenge her death, even freeze the entire planet (a concept clearly taken from the Batman episode ""Deep Freeze""). Just goes to show how much love can corrupt a good man's mind. That was the side of the movie I liked, but the characterisation of Freeze sometimes made it hard to believe (anything but Arnold's fault: he could have done a fantastic job had the filmmakers allowed him to).All in all, this movie was nowhere near Oscar-worthy, but the cast members (especially Chris O'Donnell) did NOT deserve those Razzie nominations. It should have been much better, but it still wasn't bad at all. In my opinion, this was better than Batman Forever (too cartoon-like for my taste).6/10 stars.",Batman & Robin

608,courtjester,You'll flinch! You'll cry! You'll blow chunks!,2,8 July 2001,"This movie is pretty bad.Batman has been portrayed as both campy and gritty. Schumacher (sp?) takes the campy approach to Batman. This isn't the fun-loving, creative camp of the 60s TV series, but rather a disjointed mess.  The gaudy set designs and costumes are awful. Arnold gives one of the worst performances I can recall. Uma Thurman is so-so.  Over-the-top portrayals of villains don't have to be so awful. Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, Julie Newmar, etc. pull the task with much more skill in the old TV series.  O'Donnell's Robin and Silverstone's Batgirl are shallow and selfish - who would want to root for them? George Clooney is actually halfway decent as Bruce Wayne, but there's not much for him to work with. I doubt that many fans of Batman comics or cartoons would like this movie.",Batman & Robin
609,pksoze22,Bad,1,25 March 2005,"This movie came out my senior year in College. I had seen the previous three Bat films in the theater and found them entertaining. And to tell the truth I had seen the trailer for this movie and was really excited. I saw it the first day it came out.So, I had no preconceived notions about this film. What I saw was the worst film I've ever seen. Look there are worse movies but they're mostly B movies and are expected to stink. I had no idea what to expect when I saw this but it wasn't certainly what I got.The first bad sign was the one liner from Arnold ""You're not sending me to the coolah"", then the one liners kept coming with no real dialog. Then there was Uma camping it up to extremes not seen since the 60's series. Other bad things kept happening. Clooney not even adopting a Batman voice. Bane reduced to a stooge. The idiotic and pointless bike race. And finally the low point in film history the Bat Credit Card. When I saw that scene I flashed back to the first scene in Batman89 where Bat's is scaring the punk to death and nearly throws him off the roof. The Bat Credit Card was its opposite in every way. The minute I saw it my brain began to shut down.This movie is insulting on a level I've never seen before. And Goldsman, Schumacher, and the cast should apologize for this unadulterated garbage.If you haven't seen it DO NOT SEE IT.",Batman & Robin
610,commieluke,make the bad man stop,1,18 March 2003,"I'm not a fan of Batman. i never read the comics, the cartoons all bored me to tears, the old 60s series made me want to tear my eyes out, and while the first three films were by no means awful i found them very forgettable.then why is it that i hate this film so?i can understand how fans of gothic Batman would feel betrayed by what the talentless hack Shumacher has done to thier beloved franchise, and i can only imagine the bile this film rises in thier stomachs.
whats the worst film ever? it's certinly not this one, but it's bad enough that whenever the question comes up this is the film that immediatly comes to mind.lets do the checklistDialouge - awful. unless your a fan of every possible cold based pun. if thats your idea of fun, then you must be the elusive target audience for this film.Acting - awful. you'll have to decide for yourself where the bad script stops and the bad acting starts, i sure as hell coulden't discover the dividing line.Special Effects - ahhh! this must be where the budget for this film went!Set Design - you like neon? no? well brace yourself. you can shut your eyes if you want but the damn stuff burns it's way through your eyelids.Plot - plot? what a plot? Poison Ivy wants to cover the world with plants. Mr Freeze want to freeze the world. correct me if i'm wrong, but if the entire planet was put through another ice age woulden't that kill off a large amount of vegitation?? aren't Mr Freezes aims and Poison Ivys fairly incompatable? actully the main problem isn't the lack of plot, rather there's to much of it. it boils down to watching a group of random events tied very loosely together, but never actully reaching anything approaching cohesion.it's not all bad though. the special effects were good and Micheal Gouth (Alfred) turned in his usual excellent performance for what little screentime he has.this is an awful awful film. don't say i never warned you.",Batman & Robin
611,DHK52980,"Not the best batman, but certainly not the worst either.",8,14 June 2005,"I have to take exception with the first reviewer of this film. Batman and Robin wasn't the best of the series, but it wasn't the worst either. (That honor goes to the previous one with too overthetop Jim Carrey as the ""villian?"".Arnold Schwarzenegger did an excellent job portraying Mr. Freeze. (which surprised me; I didn't think he could do it.) And yes, Uma was over the top a bit as Poison Ivy, but it fit the character.If the series hadn't started out with Michael Keaton is Bruce Wayne/Batman, I would have had no trouble with George Clooney's portrayal. He did look the part, but failed to exhibit the brooding and torn personality that was Batman. So far no one has done that better than Keaton.The storyline was a bit better than the last two as well. The villains had reasons for destroying the world that one could almost sympathize with if it didn't mean the annihilation of the human race.Now on to the bad news. I couldn't agree more with the other reviewer when it comes to Chris O'Donnell's Robin and Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl. O'Donnell just didn't look or act the part, in this movie or the last one, and Alicia Silverstone can't act her way out of a paper bag. I have NEVER seen her do a good job of acting in any movie. There are so many other young actresses that could have done the job well, why did some idiot choose her? This isn't the best of the series, that honor goes to the first batman movie. But it is probably the best of the sequels. As much as I enjoyed Michele Pfieffer as Catwoman, the way she came into being (being licked alive by dozens of cats) was ridiculous, as was the idea of Oswald Cobblepot being raised by penguins. At least the way Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy came into being had a hint of believability.Enjoy this movie for what it is - entertaining escapism from the real world. It wasn't great, but it was good.",Batman & Robin
612,silvercreature,so wrong it makes Adam West look like the true Dark Knight,3,23 June 2005,"So this is Batman. No. This is NOT Batman. This is some horribly twisted, disgusting display that CALLS itself Batman. I don't even know where to begin, I'm so overwhelmed by its degree of suckitude. But I have to try. OK, let's start with the man himself, Batman. Played by George Clooney. Clooney smirks his way through this movie without ever once appearing even slightly dark, menacing, tortured or cool. He seems to be simply playing the Bruce Wayne front that the REAL Batman puts up for the public. Only all the time. At Wayne Manor. In the Batcave. While fighting criminals. All the time. Clooney can't help but deliver a suave, smug rich guy who thinks he's better than everyone. Instead of the brooding, guilt-ridden defender of Gotham, we get a pretty-boy in a cape, spouting ridiculous dialog at every turn. If this whole movie wasn't such a dismal mess, other characters would simply laugh their asses off at Batman, as he's about as dangerous and edgy as a door to door salesman. However, this movie's one success is that it's consistently bad at every possible level. So Clooney's laughable Batman fits right in.Such a depiction of Batman would be totally incompatible with the Gotham City that fans of the comics would be familiar with. Batman's world is supposed to be dark, gritty and disturbing. It's a decayed city where many of the villains are mentally twisted and even heroes like Batman are tinged with darkness. It's a style that's much like a '30s film noir, where a noble hero must struggle against an environment that is wholly oppressive. This style is completely abandoned by Schumacher who decided to replace it with glitz, glam and extreme air boarding. This first began in Batman Forever where Dick Grayson fights a gang covered in neon paint and use glow sticks for weapons. In Batman and Robin, this is taken to the next level where the entire city is painted in a homo-rainbow of disco colors. Despite their gaudy outfits, when villains like Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy show up, they fit right in with their surroundings. Batman cartoonishly taking out a ""Batman credit card"" and pheromone dust visibly flowing into his nose go along with Schumacher's ""Sunset Strip"" version of Gotham City. In this lack of seriousness, and its constant underestimation of the audience, it's like the '60s Batman show, only with a budget.When it comes to the character of Mr. Freeze, any fan of the comic book or the animated series would know that he is a calculating, emotionless villain whose technology makes up for his lack of physical power. Brains over brawn, right? Well, who better to play this character than muscle-bound action star Arnold Schwarzenegger? That makes as much sense as casting Stallone as The Scarecrow. So Mr. Freeze stomps around in his mechasuit of doom and spewing the most painful ice-related puns, his villainy culminating to the grand ""let's freeze the city"" plan, we realize the movie has obviously been balanced with a second villain. Well, what would thrive in this winter wonderland? Plants? Of course. So Poison Ivy jumps on board this Bob Kane wreck-fest. While Uma Thurman is obviously a pretty woman, she doesn't have the correct full bodied voluptuous look that the seductress Poison Ivy should. Instead we get a lanky broad in a rejected Green Giant outfit throwing around her lust dust and getting Batman and Robin in ridiculous Springer-esquire feuds. But while Poison Ivy and her two-ton ice tank of a partner get everything about their characters wrong, it's hardly as blasphemous as a certain henchman...Which brings us to Bane. A minor character in Batman and Robin. Which, I suppose, is a good thing. I shudder to think what they would have done with him were he to be the main villain. With that said, reducing a character such as Bane to the position which he filled in this movie is more than just stupid; it's downright insulting to those of us who know what Bane is really like - a malevolent, calculating and cunning villain who's downright scary for reasons beyond his physical stature and strength. Remember, Bane beat Batman. Granted, he held many advantages over his foe, running him ragged before finally taking him down in an exhausted state. But lots of villains have held advantages over Batman only to get their butts royally kicked. Bane could have killed Batman, but chose instead to ""break"" him - making one hell of a statement and in the process opening the door for Jean-Paul Valley to take over the mantle of the Bat for awhile. Until Batman had to take him down as well.Anyway, in this train wreck of a movie, Bane is simply a stomping, drooling drone that serves as an interior decorator for Poison Ivy. The only words he says are monosyllabic repetitions of what other characters have said in his presence. He starts out as a pathetic, skinny and sniveling worm who is completely transformed by Venom. Which is not how Venom is supposed to work at all. The point is that Bane is formidable and dangerous to begin with; the Venom only made him more so. Batman and Robin never take him seriously because they don't have to. Like everyone else in Batman and Robin. Bane sucks. Hard.Robin isn't nearly as flawed as Batman in this movie. But considering the script, there's really no way anything in this ""film"" can be good.Batgirl? Pointless and barely used anyway. Alicia Silverstone? Makes about as much sense as everything else, I guess. She's Alfred's niece? Whatever.In order to really fathom just how awful this movie really is, all you have to do is ask yourself this question: Is there any way that it could have been any worse?Once you realize that you can't come up with a single thing, you will understand.",Batman & Robin
613,Justin-r-bates,The Death of Batman...What Happened?!,1,11 October 2014,"Batman and Robin is part of the continuing saga of Bruce Wayne (played by George Clooney) and his nocturnal adventures to protect Gotham from crime, despair and super-villains. In this installment, he faces off against Mr. Freeze (Arnold Scwarzenegger), Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and, to a lesser extent, Bane. The release of Batman and Robin in 1997 marked the tragic end of Batman on a cinematic scale for almost 10 years - until Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins rebooted the franchise in 2005. This movie is the 4th installment in what, so far as I can tell, is a continuation of the cinematic Batman series started by Tim Burton in 1989. The first three films (Batman, Batman Returns, and Batman Forever) fared infinitely better in the box office and among fans than did the last installment with George Clooney under the mask. I do not, by any means, feel that this was a good movie; it is widely accepted as one of the worst superhero movies of all time. First, let's discuss why this movie was universally disliked and then try to point out some areas which really showed promise. Poison Apples (get it, that's a Bat Pun):1) The Very First Scene of the film opens with close up shots of bat-nipples and bat buns. When I first saw it, I thought that it was a joke but, unfortunately, they were serious. I feel that the blame should be equally distributed between the Director of Photography (why on Earth did you feel the need to zoom in like that?) and the costume designers (I mean, honestly, does the suit really need bat nipples?).2) Robin shouting ""Cowabunga"" as he surfs to safety on a metal door from 30,000 feet above Gotham.3) Angsty Robin tired of living in Batman's shadow illustrated by the unimaginative line, ""I want a Robin signal in the sky.""4) Bane as a moron that repeats words like a zombie.5) ENDLESS puns about ice, cold, freezing, and defrosting from the ""Ice Man.""Plot Points with Promise:1) Mr. Freeze - I would submit that one of this film's greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses - Victor Fries (a.k.a. Mr. Freeze). Victor Fries is a fascinating, complex character when his motivation is understood and explored - that is, to save his wife who suffers from a debilitating disease. Like Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, he does not succumb to the ""simple evil"" archetype that plagues so many films - i.e. Voldemort in the Harry Potter series, whose motivation is, quite simply, to rule the world for the sake of gratifying his own pride. Don't get me wrong, sometimes a simple villain is all you need, especially when the story is more protagonist-centric. Regardless, it's refreshing to explore the villain as less of a maniacal baddie and more a reflection of the protagonist. What is a great villain, really, if not a hero in their own minds? Unfortunately, the filmmakers spoil their chance at a complex villain beneath a slew of endless 'ice puns' that rob the character of any depth to which he aspires.2) Bruce Wayne & Alfred Pennyworth: The highlight of this film, for me, was the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his trusty butler Alfred. I love how this film shows a whole different side to Alfred and Bruce's relationship. He is so much more than just Bruce's butler; he is a father figure, friend and confidant. During one of their scenes, Alfred so eloquently articulates Bruce's true motivation for taking up his role as Batman: ""Death and chance stole your parents, but rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman, if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world? An attempt to control death itself."" 3) I would also submit that George Clooney did as good of a job as could be expected, given the plethora of other problems with this movie. I found him to be quite a convincing millionaire/bachelor - but I guess that didn't take too much acting on his part. Overall, a pretty bad movie. My recommendation, watch it as a comedy with an eye for the few promising elements or just skip it.",Batman & Robin
614,mtsaska,this movie is the worst movie ever,1,15 September 2004,"Don't get me wrong, I love Batman. But this movie was not Batman. The movie is too lighthearted to be a Batman film. Not only that but that idiot Joel Schumacher took the greatest Batman villain ever (BANE) and turned him into a mindless beast. Bane was the only villain in Batman's history that was smart enough to beat him. He's a brilliant character in the comics, He and Batman are split right down the middle. If they were going to spend the money to get Schwarzenegger they might as well have had him play Bane (he looks the part) and done a series of three movies depicting the Knightfall trilogy.

You have to like it for what it is and its a Batman movie, a FICTION movie. There is no way you pretend to take seriously some guy who dresses as a bat and fights villains with ice powers like Mr. Freeze or with plant-like powers like Poison Ivy. What did you expect? see it as a live action cartoon. If you want a more serious approach go see The Godfather or something like that because there is no way you can fit all these fantastic characters in a realistic plot, even Nolan attempted it and failed though most people praise his work in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight i think it tries to be so serious so much that ends up being pretentious and ridiculous. Batman and Robin doesn't pretend to be serious or realistic but to provide you with an enjoyable story and nice visuals and does the job very well.I didn't like Batman Forever that much, specially because Joel S. destroyed all the darkness from the previous 2 films and the atmosphere Burton gave them, but in this film, despite being flashy and campy like its predecessor its not as ridiculous and has a good plot, nice characters, good action and its highly entertaining. If you liked the 1966 series you don't have reason to dislike this because its pretty much a modern version of that show.Im very disappointed we didn't get to see a sequel to this. I would have loved seeing the bat-trio in a new adventure against any of the villains that were yet to appear such as Scarecrow or even a comeback by Catwoman or the Riddler.",Batman & Robin

This movie is horrible, worst Batman movie ever! Everyone with the exception of Michael Gough (Alfred) and Pat Hingle (Gordon) are miscast in this movie. Arnold took a huge step backwards from the last villain he portrayed, to play this guy who cracks so many puns it's quite more painful than circumcision. George Clooney isn't Batman, he's himself in a bat suit complete with bat nipples. Playing Batman is a tough job and he didn't try, you need to play three characters but he played himself in all three parts. 1. Bruce Wayne the playboy billionaire 2. Bruce Wayne as he is alone 3. Bruce Wayne as Batman. On a side note, I like the aforementioned actors, Arnold has starred in great action flicks like the Terminator series, Totall Recall, and Predator. George Clooney is a great actor, I don't blame him for this disaster, he's even publicly apologized for this movie and so did director Joel Schumacher.This really isn't a movie, it's a two hour long toy commercial with sloppy acting, sets that look like they were made for toy commercials, and way too many supporting characters and subplots nobody cares about. I swear the writers were drunk when they wrote the script when it came down to Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy's plan, yeah they teamed up. Freeze plans to freeze Gotham and then the WORLD! Ivy then plans to repopulate the planet with new plants, anyone with a brain would know PLANTS CAN'T GROW ON ICE! Let's talk about Robin played by Chris O''Donnell, he's a spoiled brat and I want him to freeze to death, enough said. Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) is way over the top and she comes off as sex symbol acting like a porn star with a plant fetish. Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is the most shoehorned character ever, how she became Batgirl makes no sense. There's suspension of disbelief, but in this movie try suspension of insanity. Bane, no just no. Bane is not a brainless brute who growls gibberish, he's supposed to be intelligent, here he's a blithering idiot. Wow, you guys messed up big time!It's difficult to talk about the plot because as I said, there are way too many subplots. I've covered the plans of villains, but Freeze also has a dying wife and he's trying to find a cure for her illness which Alfred also has, what a coincidence! Robin just whines about how much Batman thinks he sucks and he desires Ivy because of her influence. Need I go on?This is one the worst superhero movies ever, it can make you laugh at it's horror but you're laughing to prevent yourself from crying. The movie had no clue what it was talking about, you hear these people say stuff and you think to yourself ""What?"". No logic, physics or a good cohesive plot or narrative to follow with fleshed out or complex characters, it's a live action cartoon for babies. The whole experience of it is cringe worthy. This movie definitely gets an F! It's littered with bad acting, laughable dialogue, terrible sets, sickening innuendos, and an unbelievable onslaught of many puns. This movie sucks!

The movie does introduced a new batman actor but keeps the amazing Chris O'Donnell as Robin.
Was this great movie? No.
Was it fun and full of funny ice puns and some 'cheesiness' especially with Uma Thurman character Poison Ivy.? Yes!.
This is NOT a bad movie at all, in fact it's BETTER than some Marvel movies.",Batman & Robin
622,johnsoncooper,Awfully good,10,3 March 2021,"Throughout the years I've always loved the Nolan Batmans. I grew up with them and went to see them in the theater. Now there are some good and bad movies from back in the day, whether which one is good or bad is up to the viewer. Personally I really love the Burton Batman's, I kept Joel's movies far away from me. But I didn't know how much I was missing out on. Batman Forever was alright. But Batman and Robin, that's a unintentional masterpiece. It's fun to watch sober, it's 100x fun when you watch it stoned out of your mind. And I think most of the credit needs to go to the acting, Arnold was badass, Uma Thurman did a really good job for how bad the movie was panned, to me she's the face of Poison Ivy in the live action versions. George Clooney is meh, like I forget he's there. O'Donnell is good, Silverstone is alright too. Overall this movie is a more ""SO BAD ITS GOOD"" kind of thing.",Batman & Robin
623,CinemaOddity,How did this come to fruition,2,12 April 2017,"I will not be delving into spoilersThe only reason I won't give this a 0 is the actors looking like they want this to work and the entertainment factor of ""so bad it's good"" Let's start with the ""acting"". The reason for quotations is that the performances go Nicolas Cage over-the-top. The delivery is so poor and shabby it makes Twilight looked like an Academy-Award winner. I can't blame the actors with a script like this. The puns...OH GOD. ""What killed the dinosaurs?..THE ICE AGE."" I'm sorry Mr. Schwarzenegger, but that is prehistorically incorrect and the timing was awful. Now imagine one like that every minute or so. The CGI is early 80's cheese. The logic is terrifyingly stupid.This came at a time when Batman was supposed to be dark, brutal, and realistic. This movie sent that whole concept out the window. Please, watch the GOOD Batman films such as:The Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman(1989)& Batman Returns(1992), the animated films(my favorite being the Dark Knight Returns, and even the badness of Batman Forever and Dawn of Justice are nothing compared to THIS!",Batman & Robin

625,Pythius,Pathetic waste of time,1,4 October 1998,"""Batman Forever"" was bad. This, unfortunately, is much worse. It is hard, when attempting a serious critique of a film of such low-calibre, to know where to start when picking out its faults. Certainly the script is terrible. Over these last two movies in the series, the scriptwriting has undergone a dramatic decline from the quality of the first two, largely (if not entirely) due to the influence of Akiva Goldsman. Here the one-liners come thick and fast and not one of them is worth repeating. The narrative is extremely poorly formed and there are many loose ends jumps in logic as to the devolving relationship between the title characters. Particularly, the character of Poison Ivy makes absolutely no sense, at least that I can fathom. Robin comes across as a spoiled brat and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze merely defies description as possibly THE worst Batman villain on the screen. George Clooney is new to the cape and seems to be lost in trying to find his own way of translating the character. Not to worry, if this is the standard of quality, there hopefully won't be a fifth film. Chris O'Donnell plays a marvellously annoying Robin, but it is quite arguable as to whether this was intended of indeed, whether O'Donnell is acting at all. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy at least tries hard in the role, but not even Thurman can pull off the snake-headed flowers and emerge unscathed. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, I suspect, would have maintained a better handle on the role if only it were better developed and her second side not introduced so late in the film. Indeed, this lack of character development is any many ways the major problem with the script. We know, from Batman mythology, that the characters of Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze and Two-Face (from ""Batman Forever"") are all intricate character with their own storylines and sympathetic sides. This is totally ignored in this film in deference to the implausible and uninteresting stunts. Schumacher has tried to play the action card upon us once again and has failed miserably, where in ""Batman Forever"" it was probably the saving grace. Schumacher's revamped Gotham is truly hideous and impractical to say the least and the observatory itself is quite quite exquisitely awful. I would recommend this film only to budding film-makers not only as a dystopic view on how films should NOT be made but also as a lesson in how much advertising and hype can shield the public from actual quality",Batman & Robin
626,swansong-2,"I'm not saying it's bad...well, okay, yes, I am.",1,22 March 1999,"Soooo, lemme get this straight...  If I wanted to make a Batman movie, all I'd have to do would be to cram as many Batfoes as possible into a story so thin, it'll break the first time someone sneezes, throw in lots and lots and lots of rubber, add a weepy element, say, make the butler croak, mix in some ""sex"" appeal (alleged, anyway), whisk briskly with a LOT of faith in audience disbelief, and voila!!  A piece of crap.I have watched dozens and dozens of movies in the course of my life, some good, some not so good, some really bad, and some I wished I'd never seen. I have never, never once in my life claimed that I have seen the worst movie ever made.  Well, I have finally seen the worst movie ever made.I wanted so badly to like this movie, I really did.  I'm a huge fan of the series, so I came into this movie with an open mind, honest.  I STRAINED to find something to like, and I think I succeeded...I really liked Arnie's fluffy slippers.  I have all three of the previous Batman movies, and while I was disappointed in the second, I have to say that it was a thousand times better than this unbelievably pompous, bright (I mean colour-wise...I got a headache watching all of the friggin' neon in this movie), and terribly acted sequel.  Oh, the acting, don't even get me started...What is it with the villians in this series??  In the first movie, the Joker was able to take Batsy on by himself...and did a pretty bang-up job of it, too.  The second and third ones had to bring in TWO villians to take the Long-Eared One on.  Just to keep things fair, though, they gave Tall, Dark, and Exploited a partner, Robin, in the third one to help with the butt-whuppin'.  (After all, Two Face had TWO personalities...that counts, right?)  In this gawd-awful mess, however, they needed not one, not two, but THREE (count 'em, folks!) villains to take the guy in the funny rubber suit. So, naturally, they have to even the score even more here...ergo, Batgirl. And the most disappointing example of the Lady in the Silken Mask I have ever seen.  Alicia, how could you?!  In this shlock, Batgirl is nothing but pretty moving scenery.  The only time she gets to shine is when she's kicking Poison Ivy's six-foot (six-foot????) butt, and even that's marred by the atrocious dialogue.  Furthermore, the writers had the unbelievable gall to pointlessly change Barbara's relations, from Commissioner Gordon's daughter in the comics, to Alfred's niece, just so they could try kacking the old guy off in an effort to add a humane element.  What?????  I'm not going to waste any more time talking about this film...it's not worth it. Blah.",Batman & Robin
627,Mad Mark,"Sad, oh, so sad! A cartoon would have been better.",1,6 March 1999,"If it had been made by Disney, if it had been made in the 50's, if we haven't had Tim Burton's as comparison, this ""cartoon"" by Joel Shumacher ""may"" have been acceptable. Even the old TV series with all those ""whams"" and ""bams"" was at least forgivable, for the decade it was made. But after Tim Burton brilliantly captured a certain dark side of the winged hero, and created villains with deep, intense personalities, this Batman and Robin is just unbearable.I don't like ""ER"", so I am not really a fan of George Clooney, but if this is the best he has... well, no offence intended. Chris O'Donnell can't give any life to his character, which was a bad idea in the first place. Batgirl has nothing to do there, the story would have been better off without her, although Alicia is so cute that she can be forgiven anything. As for the villains, the plot is so ""childish"" (to say the least) that nothing could have saved them. Uma Thurman looks just plainly ridiculous, she is a much better actress than that. Arnold probably wore all that make up because he didn't want to be recognised. The only performance worth saving is Michael Gough's Alfred, but the soap opera ""daddy, I love you!, (sob! sob!)"" situation in which the story places him is just depressing.Even the dialogs... I hadn't seen such intellectual, clever,  mind-blowing lines in the deepest works of Kafka. The plot is so powerfully... boring! that my 5 year old nephew asked me to change it for a Scooby Doo cartoon. And the worst of it all is that at the end, there is this treat hanging that there may be a Batman 5... Please!

I was a bit disappointed about the change in Batman again..this time it was George Clooney. Now, I've seen other Clooney movies, and this is, by far, his worst acting job yet. He was an awful Batman/Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell could have been a better Robin if he'd had a better script. Arnold Schwarzenegger was absolutely appalling. His ""freeze"" one-liners got tiresome after the first one. The best of the bunch had to be Uma Thurman, although I can not see one conceivable reason why she accepted doing this movie. Joel Schumacher has totally destroyed what started out as a great movie franchise. Tim Burton did an excellent job on ""Batman"", then an even better job on ""Batman Returns."" Why did he let Schumacher take over? He is trying to take us back to the old Batman TV series with such campiness.

Everything about this film is a disaster, from the ghastly colors and sets, to Schumacher's often manic direction, to the lack of acting on the part of people which I know can give a decent performance, whether ""Pulp Fiction""'s Uma Thurman, or ""Out of Sight""'s George Clooney. Bruce Wayne/Batman is reduced in this movie to a parent trying to control his dysfunctional family consisting of complaining Dick Grayson and the bratty Barbara who becomes Batgirl.

Premises change - there's one seat in the Batmobile now so Robin can go off and do his own thing etc.  Batgirl is literally a girl that should still be at school.  As SFX go they're great but the film is too childish.  How do you storyboard a 'fight' on hover boards which turns out to be a stupid game and actually agree to fund and film it.

The scenery is just ridiculous (big, 4,000 foot high statues appear at random along highways that weave around skyscrapers of equal height). I would say that I am convinced that the director got his script by chaining a drugged monkey to a typewriter, but even a drugged primate couldn't possibly be dumb enough to have written this. Their is a constant barrage of one-liners that are mind-numbingly bad, and whoever did write this forgot to follow up on their own lame subplots. What happens to Elle MacPherson's character? She is last seen practically proposing to Bruce Wayne, leaving him with the ultimatum marry me or leave me, forty five minutes in to the movie. What happens? We'll never know. No mention of her existence is made after that, even though Bruce promised to get back to her. I could go on and on (and on!) about how bad this movie is, but it's too annoying.

By that point though Warner Brothers figured Batman movies were a cash cow. Just crank out another bat flick and viola profits through the roof.Between George Clooney, the bat-suit with nipples, the neon circus wagon the batmobile became, and giant naked man statues everywhere Schumacher made this movie a chorus of ""It's Raining Men"" away from being a gay porno.

647,robert-w-andrews,From hero to subzero.,2,28 October 2012,"With ""Batman Forever"" previously standing as the worst addition to the Batman saga in cinema history, its unlikely anyone would blame Tim Burton for completely dropping out of this production due to the massacre that his formerly praised contributions have endured. With Joel Schumacher in full control all hope of a long awaited respectable installment is lost in one swift, ridiculed and utterly appalling excuse for a Batman movie.Disappointment is present within every aspect of the films shameful creation, as the narrative surpasses the foolishness of the previous two productions, as it is evident that Schumacher had learned nothing from the disturbing lack of seriousness in ""Batman Forever"". In this installment Batman and Robin face a trio of adversaries, as with Mr Freeze hellbent on putting Gotham City on ice in attempt to cure his wife, Poison Ivy intervenes with her own agendas with the assistance of a reckless super solder otherwise known as Bane. The plot is severely flawed, as the idea of a temperature restricted super villain attempting to transform Gotham into a work of the arctic is simply ludicrous. What is even more frustrating is the lack of development or reasonable origins for the three villains, as they are all unsubstantial and quite frankly inexcusable. Furthermore the absurd style in which the plot is delivered for the matter results in viewers caring little for the damned city of Gotham regardless of how far Mr Freeze progresses with his villainous plans. Besides the main plot, aspects of the sub-plot bring forward several undeveloped issues to the viewer all of which lack consistency in terms of the focus upon them, as all of these disappointing factors result in a plot unworthy of any recognition due to its disregard for seriousness and inability to fully develop characters and minor aspects of the plot.Visuals remain a key issue from the previous installment, as Joel Schumacher's personal touch to various elements of the films visuals in particular only serve to worsen the production further. With the artificially luminous colour pallet still in use it tends to negatively coincide with the poorly designed and endless ice based props all courtesy of Mr Freeze's reign of ludicrous terror. The most stupid of all however is the inclusion of not only Bat bums, but nipples, skates, surfing and a bank card designed specifically for the Caped Crusader, as these pointless props add to the ridiculous style and the excessive number of goofs.Standing as the 3rd Batman in just 4 films the lack of consistency in the casting of Batman evidently leads to the shambles of a performance that George Clooney forces upon a now disappointed fan base. Clooney simple exceeds the disappointment of any past cast caped crusader, as he obtains no heroic qualities leading to an unauthentic performance due to his lack of belonging in the production. With Chris O'Donnell's unfortunate return as Robin, the reckless, young and inferior sidekick has become an even more unlikable character as his arrogance allows him to be utterly disliked and irritable throughout. Furthermore the on screen chemistry between the two is abysmal at best. The pair simply squabble or fill the air with ludicrous solutions and shameful one liners that are undesired to say the least. The epitome of casting however is evidently seen in the reckless decision to include Batgirl, as this ridiculed hero sums up everything that is wrong with Batman and Robin. Alicia Silverstone portrays an arrogant and spoilt teenage girl who's arrival as Batgirl is not only unwelcoming, but disturbingly spontaneous.Unsurprisingly many of the casting choices in terms of the villains are severely flawed, yet a successfully comical performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze stands as the only pleasing performance. His performance is surprisingly enjoyable thanks to his trademark and significantly strong Austrian accent dominating lines from the literally puns personified iceman. Where there's room for one pun Schwarzenegger gives you two and regardless of how inappropriate they may seem you can't help but laugh and at least enjoy one aspect of this painfully awful production. Unfortunately in terms of the casting and presentation of the remaining 2 villains nothing could be more insulting to the films comic book origins. With a ridiculous costume design, Uma Thurman's performance is simply diabolical. With a tendency to irritably and spontaneously narrate in a form of poetic verse, her actions in the film are simply repetitive and unbearable which evidently accounts for the film's equally poor narrative. Considering his origins are that of a super soldier high expectations were certainly set for Bane who originally stood as a diverse villain, however such a poor representation of such a superior character disgraces the honoured work of Bob Kane. Bane is reduced to a giant, grumbling, slow and motionless character, a representation completely opposite to his first appearance in a Batman comic in 1993. If Bane is unable to break the Bat he can certainly contribute in breaking this formerly admired franchise.It is evidently clear that since Schumacher's hijack of the Batman franchise upon his arrival on the scene of Batman Forever has ensured its utter deterioration. Surpassing the disappointment of previous installments, this horrific and disgraceful production is undeserving of any major credibility and is unlikely to be forgotten in the painfully reminiscent years to come.",Batman & Robin

649,president-18,A different side of Batman,7,30 April 2006,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I guess it would have been my sophomore year of high school. I saw it around the same time I saw 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,' which was truly beyond bad. I thought it was TERRIBLE.I just recently went back to this movie because it was on Starz. I must say, I was entirely entertained. I also respect the movie more than I did.I discovered new entertainment value when I recognized that the movie isn't even TRYING to be a good Batman film. It knows itself to be ridiculous, and it doesn't take itself seriously because of it. In fact, the movie doesn't take anything seriously. It's silly from beginning to end.It achieves exactly what it is trying to be, and for that it deserves credit. It's camptacular, with over-the-top special effects, costumes, and one-liners. Many people derided it for being a special-effects driven film, but I disagree. I think the special effects exist to drive the stupidity. The wilder the effects, the more unrealistic it all is, and the funnier it gets. It is a stupidity driven film.This is what the 60's TV show would have been with a massive budget. It understands that everything about Batman is silly, and it takes that to its logical end. The bad guys are even more out there than the first Batman movies, the dialogue wouldn't seem out of place at a beach party, and the Batmobile is just, well, you'll have to see.The cinematography is great, the set design is beautifully over the top, and the colors could keep a person high on meth occupied. The script is terrible, and there really isn't any plot, but that doesn't matter. It's not even part of the equation.They took everything campy about action movies and distilled it down to this. And for that, it deserves credit. Once I let go of what I expected from a Batman movie, and stopped judging it based on what I thought should be in the film, and just let me experience it as any other film I may come across, I really rather fell for it.I enjoyed this movie more than 'Batman Begins,' which is certainly a far better film by most measures, but is missing that je'ne se quas of a film that perfectly embodies what it's trying to be. 'Batman Begins' was patently absurd (a secret society of ninjas??), but it took itself gravely seriously. This movie is even more absurd, and it absolutely revels in it. I think that makes it the better film.But that's just my opinion.",Batman & Robin

It was just such a terrible film that I suffered an aneurysm from an overabundance of terrible puns, that Schwarzenegger kept pulling out of his icehole.It was disgusting and it was like eating vomit, then having the runs with only sharp nuts and hot chilli in your stomach, pouring out and burning, scratching your sphincter. This film caused me great pain, and I wanted to shoot himself in the eyes.

The costumes are awkward and rubber-looking, the effects are cheesier than a pizza kitchen, and the dialogue couldn't be saved by a fully stocked hospital. But this movie is hilarious on a completely different plane of existence. Seriously, if you gain some kind of ironic satisfaction from TERRIBLE flicks, then this movie is in the same gallery of crap as such titles as The Room and Birdemic. To give you a little taste, here's a scene from the film. At one point, a character drops the line, 'you're entitled to your opinion, but I'm not good with rejection, I'm afraid you'll have to die'. And it is dropped in such a way that makes the 'They're eating her' line from Troll 2 look like Oscar bait.

660,acwal,Batman And Robin: too soon an end of an era,2,11 February 2017,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.1997 saw Batman And Robin hit the big screen, considered a flop by the other films standards, it has been almost universally panned and is overall a disappointment.The acting ranges from mediocre to generally cringe worthy, George Clooney is a huge stepdown from Michael Keaton and even to an extent, Val Kilmer, he speaks his lines out like someone ordering a hamburger, Chris O Donnell who did an decent job in Batman Forever is reduced to whining and cringeworthy lines ('I want a car!, chicks dig the car!), Alicia Silverstone is probably the best actress of the trio, she was given grief to a supposed weight gain at the time. the trio of villains, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane are played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman and Jeep Swanson, They do their best with their material but Schwarzenegger is just terribly miscast.The films score is a plus though, Elliot Goldenthal who composed Batman Forever, returns to score this film, the score is not on par with Danny Elfman's score from the Burton flicks, but is still decent to listen to, The Smashing Pumpkins song 'The End Is The Beginning Is The End' is used in the films credits and R. Kelly contributes the track 'Gotham City'.What we have here is a classic case of too many cooks in the kitchen, due to being rushed into development and trailers appearing just a year after Batman Forever, the film has been accused of being made only to market toys so what we have here is a 2 hour toy commercial.After the films critical and financial failure, the series remained dormant until 2005 when Christopher Nolan rebooted the series with Batman Begins, a more grittier and cynical film.",Batman & Robin

663,Ce_Aqatl,"Less than stellar, but not ungodly crap",6,20 May 2007,"The much-maligned Batman and Robin, while doubtlessly the worst of Batman movies, does not deserve its abysmal reputation. It does feature some incredibly cheesy lines, stupid jokes (esp. the one about the Poison Ivy action figure), and a plot that's somewhat improbable even for a children-aimed comic book. While I prefer the ""brooding Batman"" side of the Caped Crusader, I have no compunctions against the light-hearted approach, and Batman and Robin is over-the-top enough to be funny. The film's got some nice displays of acting from Michael Gough and Arnold Schwarzenegger - his talents as an actor are vastly underrated, and, while too clownish as Mr. Freeze, Schwarz puts on a convincing and compassionate display of Dr. Fries' affection for his wife. The rest of the cast are somewhat wooden (Clooney, Silverstone) or irritating (O'Donnel, Thurman - she can really do better than play a sexually frustrated plant-woman), but their flaws don't warrant mud-slinging. The effects are astounding if repetitive and ostentatious, and don't fail to impress even by today's standards. In a nutshell, this movie could have been so much better, but still can be taken at face value.

664,Efram,This didn't have to happen,1,10 January 1999,"Why Warner Bros. hasn't had the writers of the Batman animated series work a script for a Batman film is beyond me. They know the animated stuff is much better in story, design, character, and I even think they know the buffet on the animated series was better than the last two Batman films. Burton did it best because he has the dark mind for Batman. Which is what Batman is supposed to be: dark. Not some snowboarding, wise-cracking, no-tact superhero. Batman works with his mind, not his mouth. You know what, I'm not gonna bother touching the rest of this film because we all know it was horrific. I had stomach cramps that lasted for nearly 5 hours after seeing this ""film."" And you know what? I didn't even pay to get inside the movie and I wanted my money back! But, if it seems that Warner's understand that Batman is not to be made like some Ringling Bros. act, and they bring it back to the way of the first two films, I'll definitely go see it. The franchise isn't dead, just badly burned from an inferno call ""Shumacher"" and the fact that trying to please everyone isn't what you do with films.

667,Solo4114,"""In a world where film makers never hear 'no'....""",1,20 April 2003,"Note to Hollywood: exile Joel Schumacher for this unrivaled piece of crap. No, wait.  Scratch that.  Exile won't work, since Roman Polanski can still get an Oscar.  On second thought, just blackball Schumacher.
To begin with, I have to say that I am a fan of the comics.  Take that as you will, for it WILL color my review of this film.  I will say, however, that I am not a diehard fan.  I haven't collected the comics, nor kept them in sealed plastic bags or what have you.  I don't know every nuance of the Batman universe.  But what I DO know is that Batman is supposed to be dark, tortured, and dangerous.  Likewise, Batman's villians are supposed to be equally menacing, tortured, and dangerous.  Finally, Gotham city, as the name might suggest to anyone paying attention (obviously NOT Schumacher or his set designers) should be GOTHIC.As has been said in previous reviews of this film, Tim Burton understood this.  The first two films did an excellent job of depicting the darkness of Batman, his opponents, and Gotham City.  The latter two failed in this respect.Batman Forever was relatively entertaining, albeit a gross departure from the established conventions of the first two films.  However, it seems that Mr. Schumacher took NO heed of any of the lessons of Batman Forever. Batman Forever worked because it had a limited number of villians, a coherent storyline, and it minimized Robin's role.  What we did see of Robin portrayed him as just as dark and tortured as Batman was, and that he was driven by the same demons that haunt Batman.  Batman & Robin throws all of this out the window.The story is incoherent, and has so many different threads which must all somehow come together that no single thread is ever adequately developed. The characters necessarily suffer as a result.  Essentially, this film appears to be a vehicle for the art direction and set design, and an excuse for the stars of the film to be in a summer blockbuster.  Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Bane, etc. are all just going through the motions.The set design takes Batman Forever and tarts it up even further.  Gotham City is no longer gothic.  It is garish.  It's like Gotham City from Batman Forever at a rave.  It's like Gotham City from the FIRST two films at a rave and high on ecstasy.  It's over-the-top neon colors, buildings jutting out at pointless angles, larger-than-life crap.And then there's the script.Ahnold is at his one-lining worst in this film, as are most of the actors. ""Chill out.""  ""Take a chill pill.""  ""Take two of these and call me in the morning.""  ('cause, see, he was a DOCTOR at one point)  Some might say this is just campy over the top fun.  The Adam West version of Batman was campy over the top fun.  This is just painful to watch.  I hope everyone involved fired their agents, or at least refused to pay their commissions on this one.The simple fact of the matter is that there's just nothing redeemable or entertaining about this movie.  When I left the theater, I actually said that I would have had more fun lighting my $7 on fire and watching it burn for a few minutes than sit through this film.  This movie is so bad, so painful, so disappointing to watch that it wouldn't even be fit for MST3K. I mean, come on people.  Schumacher put nipples on the Batsuit.

Why would someone who wants to turn the world into an ice cube want to team up with someone who wants to turn it into a greenhouse?Like the movie if you must, but please don't tell me that I have to like it because I'm a Batman fan.

669,renodc,Holy Cr**py Movie Batman!!!!!,1,31 August 2004,"This is the most disappointing movie in the history of film for me.A 2 out of 10 is generous. I should give it a zero strictly based on the Bat Credit Card scene. Every single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be ""Bat-Whipped"" for this piece of junk. This is your typical ""absolutely cannot fail"" franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not ""Scientist"". Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too ""drama queen"" which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader.",Batman & Robin

It has to be at least every 20 minutes before someone actually says an appropriate dialoge, the first 15 minutes is just embarrassing. from everything to the dreadful ""I'll cancel the pizzas!!!"" to ""In Gotham City Batman and Robin protect us...even from plants and flowers"". Batman takes out his credit card in one scene, and I don't mean Bruce Wayne's credit card...I actually mean Batman's. Batman went into a bank in costume and registered for a credit card and sat down for a meeting with his banker. Bane is one of the most influential and intelligent villains, he does nothing but grunt and rwar and act stupid.

""I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy."" ""Tonight, hell freezes over!"" ""Ice to see you!"" ""Their bones will turn to ice!

Barbara has always been Gordon's daughter, since she first appeared in the campy 60's hilarious '60s batman, and Batman never knew Gordon was Batgirl until Joker shot her in ""The Killing Joke"" They decided to make her Alfred's niece, and in this batman universe, I guess anyone who finds and breaks into the bat cave gets to be Batman's sidekick.

BATMAN & ROBIN absolutely BUTCHERS everything that Batman was before, and leaves virtually nothing to take its place.  I mean if the horrible acting, dialogue, and absolutely no plot weren't bad enough, they go and throw in BANE who is from a completely different era of comics, and change his character from a fearsome and powerful ex-con (who cripples Batman in the comics) into the missing stooge, or maybe the bizarro world version of arnold?

Looking back today at 'Batman & Robin', it's clear now that Schumacher and co had no clear vision. Schumacher substituted Burton's surreal yet menacing vision (at least in 'Batman Returns') with empty spectacle and loud explosions. Fights seem to begin and end of their own accord and the good guys never seem to be in any real danger. Furthermore, a weak and incoherent plot, jokey villains who go WAY OTT (I am looking at you, Ahnold!), and outright bad acting by a smug looking George Clooney all add up to cook the film's goose.Is it watchable? Barely. There is some camp value to be had as the film approaches the spirit of the 60s Batman, even though boredom sets in way before the half way mark.Bottomline: 5/10 Campy and hollow sequel.

The dark arena of our black knight has been transformed into a cartoon-esquire disco fantasy world very badly constructed. I was so disappointed... I hope the next thing can deliver the dark fear full anger that from all time was the driving force in Batman... George Clooney is awful as Batman. He is to much of a funny guy charming cream muffin to be a tormented soul driven by darkness and fighting for justice and so is Chris O' Donnel. A very bad screen couple indeed I'm afraid. Arnold Schwarzenegger was also a total miscast for the role as mister freeze, as there ain't much of a scientist over him and he speaks like a stupid Austrian bear.. terrible.. all in all a big waste of time which isn't worth of much discussion..",Batman & Robin
685,kane_e87,''Tonights for cast a freeze is coming'',1,23 January 2005,"This movie is simply a waste of time,the acting is terrible, there are a couple things i don't get in this film, i know this has been stated before, why would Mr freeze team up with Poisson Ivy, when one wants to freeze Gotham city, and the other wants Gotham to be filled with plants.Why does Batman in this movie fall in love with poison Ivy, in the cartoon series and I'm sure in the comics, Batman knew Poisson Ivy was evil he never fell in love with her. For other men in Gotham city it is okay for them to fall in love with Ivy, but not Batman.Another contrast between the last two Batman films compared to the Michael Keaton Batman films, is the music the music in the first two films was creepier, it gives you the feeling that Gotham city is not a safe place, in the last couple films, the music reflects the lighthearted nature of the movies.The acting is terrible, George colony will never be the same Batman that Michael Keaton was, Arnold is shocking as Mr freeze, the girl who plays Batgirl is woeful, um ma Thurman was probably the only really shinning light in this film. I don't whant to go into details about Robin.Whats with the last two Batman films showing Batmans but.The scene that really summed this movie up for me, is when Alfreds niece finds the bat cave, Alfred captures her, she replies back ""i whant to fight crime with Batman and Robin"" Alfred in reply says ""I designed you a suit"".That Somme's everything about this movie.Batgirl is Commisonar Gordan niece.

686,artapme-840-333602,The worst movie ever,1,9 November 2013,"""The worst movie ever"" has to be based on more than just a terrible film which has poor performances from poor actors and bad direction and script. So my vote goes to the one which has the ""holy trinity"" going for it and is still an epic fail. Superstar actors, good director and huge budget and still it manages to be more painful to watch than you watching yourself on the mirror while you are burning alive. Slowly.#1 wost movie ever Made in 1997 and had a full superstar cast and a well established director. But what happened? Well I think Joel Schumacher was probably tripping on shrooms and decided to totally rape the theme and feel of the saga. And the actors we're acting as if they knew that Schumacher had probably just ended all of their careers. But it was too late, they had signed contracts so you gotta do your job to the end or be sued to the stone age. Thankfully this didn't end any careers, but if one had to go it should have been Schumachers. But if that is not enough. This piece of sh*t actually had a ""prequel"" in -95 ""Batman Forever"" which also had the same director, a huge budget and superstar actors.And from that, they made what can only be called a ""warning shot"". Batman was fast on his way to the wrong direction. And still they let Joel Schumacher go on his merry way to perform a Coup de gras to Batmans temple, and make another one. This is one for the history books my friends. Word to the wise: If someone does a warning shot, don't let them shoot again.",Batman & Robin

Bat Nipples 3. Bat Butt 4. Bat Crotch 5. Bat Credit Card 6. Bane Screwed-up beyond all recognition 7. Batman and Robin were prepared to fight Freeze before they even knew he existed 8.

When i got older, I enjoyed Batman for what Batman is. He is a dark hero, Batman is a Dark comic book. Everything is dark. This was campy. 95% of the movie comprised of CGI.

First off, the acting in this movie was totally cheezy. Normally, I'm an Arnie fan, but this one pushed the limit over the line. The Mr. Freeze costume looked like a hunk of plastic and the Poison Ivy costume looked like it'd been made in a KNITTING SHOP!  Chris O'donnel? Cheezy!  George Clooney?  Sorry, bud, you aren't batman.  And what was with Bane?  He was a walking dummy!  ""Bane!""  ""Bomb!"" Come on!  Gimme a break!  The one thing that was the worst was Barbara Gordon.

Kudos to whoever played him (I don't really know), but everything else about the movie was way under par.  The acting was pretty bland, the action corny, and the plot... well, I don't even remember what the plot was.

The problem was that they've slowly but surely moved from what Tim Burton created in the first two movies to the old campy TV series.  I think George deserves a script the likes of the ones Michael Keaton was given.  On another note.  I love Arnold, but Freeze became very annoying.  If they go for another Batman, I truly hope they get back to a more serious storyline and get rid of the pathetically bad lines.

The freezing FX were top notch. Exactly what they should have been.As for the rest of this mess...What bothers me the most is that this flick is almost an exact copy (from the broadest ideas to the littlest insignificant detail) of ""Batman Forever"". Take a look at these examples and keep in mind that you can find these elements in both films:(Before you read on, be aware that some of the info that follows may be considered SPOILER MATERIAL. If you haven't seen the film yet don't read this!!)1. The movie begins with a ""suiting up"" sequence in the batcave.2. Batman (and this time Robin) is on his way to stop a ""crime in progress"" by the headlining/grotesque villain (Mr. Freeze/Two Face).3. The secondary villain (Poison Ivy/Riddler)is an employee/scientist-type of Wayne Enterprises who is given ""powers"" by an experiment gone awry.4. The new hero(Batgirl/Robin) is an orphan with a taste for motorcycles.5. When the secondary villain appears she/he is wearing green and has bright orange/red hair.6. We see the creation of the primary/grotesque villain via videotape (Victor Freis falling in chemicals/Harvey Dent hit by acid).7. A blonde discovers Batman's secret identity. Wait a sec, that happens in all the Batman movies...The list goes on and on.This movie is the embodiment of the old Adam West/Burt Ward TV show. The villains are ""a little nutty"" and have side-kicks with names matching their boss's theme (i.e. ""Frostbite""). Batman and Robin are just a couple of goofballs who have nothing better to do than attend charity functions in costume. Commissioner Gordon is useless, etc.If you are a fan, a real fan, of the Batman of the comics. Don't watch this movie.

The writing is awful and corny. It's more goofy than the 60's Batman series. George Clooney gives an awful performance as the caped crusader. Robin is more winey than in the previous instalment. The casting for Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is ok, but the writing is so over the top with far to many ice puns.

701,brucemcoxford,Hey Freeze! This movie is heat!,10,22 October 2021,"In all my years as an experienced and dedicated man in the film industry I never really understood the hype of superhero movies. I have seen so many films in this category fall short everytime because of the lack of creativity, for example the much overrated Avenger Endgame, Infinity War or The Dark Knight trilogy. But wow, wow and wow Batman & Robin really delivers and shows why this is the holy grail of superhero movies!First off I have and PhD in the arts of theatre and drama and really enjoyed my years in Englands finest drama school. I remember very clearly how our tutor always tried to bring out the finest performance of ourselves and always used to give us the homework of watching this piece of art and watch closely how George Clooney and Arnold emit their finest theatrical acting and wow just how much me and my lads grew as actors just by watching those masterpiece performances. George Clooney is my Batman not Christian Bale and to be honest Clooney really deserved an oscar for this, he really saved the Batman franchise.One of the few aspects many don't notice while watching this film is how philosophical this film is. Just the whole concept of teamwork between the bat squad really brought a tear to my eye. Really makes you realise how important friends is in life and not stupid girlfriends that destroy our lives! Also the whole idea of Robin using fake lips while kissing Poison Ivy symbolises how we men always wins over toxic girls in our lives and shows us that being a strong stoic man is the right choice. Robin and Marcus Aurelius have many parallels and this shows how Joel Schumacher is a philosophical genius.The screenplay in this movie is on point. The human being that came up with all the ice puns really deserves an oscar and a comedy prize. I cried my heart out in laughter just hearing all the puns and one time i went all the way to the 4th base with a girl just by watching this on our first date. Sadly we never got married but oh boy we surely had a good time with this movie in the background if you know what i mean...The costume design in this movie is magnifico. I have also an PhD in costume design that i took recently and the whole bat nipples idea is magnificent! The nipples symbolise how strong people really can be in hard times in life. Mr. Freeze costume is on point too! Very cold and icy costume just like my uncles old santa costume back in my younger days. Nostalgia at it´s finest!I really don't have words to describe how much this movie means to me. This movie has sent me out of depression and other dark things several times and i bet the same for many others too. In the end this movie really shows us what it means to be a superhero and our duty for justice. Just put on your Batnipple suit and save the world just like our favorite dynamic duo: Batman & Robin!",Batman & Robin

703,Adamant-A,Eeeeewwwww! This is terrible!,2,23 November 2008,"This movie was so awful I couldn't believe it! Everything has changed so much since Tim Burton's dark, subtle and cool style of the first 2 Batman movies. Joel Schumacher has hit rock bottom with this turd burger.After seeing reviews of this movie by such people like the Nostalgia Critic, I was intrigued to see this movie again (the last time I saw this movie, I was 8 years old, and even then, I liked Burton's films more). Batman & Robin was on TV a few days ago, so I tuned in. After sitting through this 2 hour train wreck, I slapped myself and then cried over the time I will never get back.I'll do a quick review on this movie, too. Here goes: It's bad. Really, really bad.There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, to try and sum it up, the set pieces are very ugly, with 50 foot tall statues of half-naked men scattered randomly throughout Gotham. There is also a bad musical score, the loud and obnoxious sounds, the eye-burning neon lights that are placed all over the city, and especially the badly written screenplay. Of course Joel Schumacher's awful direction over the actors contributed to the terribility (I made up this word and claim a copyright on it) of the movie as well.Next, I want to talk about the acting: George Clooney isn't a bad Batman and he'd be a good Bruce Wayne, but he speaks some really corny lines (and let's all try and forget about the Bat-credit card scene). Also, why does Batman make public appearances instead of fighting criminals only at night? Chris O'Donnell is a bit too old to be Robin and he bitches and moans WAY too much! Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy: sure, she's hot enough but she never shuts up, she also says some corny lines, and she provoked the Bat-credit card scene! Alfred: the actor playing him was in all 4 original Batman movies, so he's loyal like a butler should be, but I think Michael Gough stuck around for one (or two) Batman movies too many.Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl: why is she Alfred's niece and not Gordon's daughter? Why does her mask cover nearly none of her face, yet no one knows her secret identity? Why does she have no British accent if she said that she lived in Britain? It's all just why, why, why with her.Bane is hardly in the movie and he is treated only as a henchman. This is a squandered role, but if he was given any more camera time, all of the characters in the movie would be way too difficult to keep track of.Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon is also hardly in the movie.And let's save worst for last... Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze! The only lines he speaks are ice puns. Mr. Freeze is supposed to be pure evil and have abandoned all care for humanity, instead he's just a big joke and a crappy villain. He can't contribute anything important to the movie if all he says are puns.The positives of this movie: some o.k. special effects, many scenes are laughable and corny (if you like that), and the women of the movie are attractive enough. AND THAT'S IT! Watch this movie only if you love Batman enough to witness his downfall into sh!tty movie history. Stick to Tim Burton's Bat-movies, Christopher Nolan's Bat-movies, and the Batman Animated Series instead.My Rating: 2/10 (1/5)",Batman & Robin
704,nevery,"Luckily Batman Begins came along, because this film almost killed the batman franchise!",1,8 April 2009,"I thought this could be a not bad movie. I mean, you can't go wrong when you hero movies, like batman or superman etc. It's possibly the only area of film where you absolutely can't go wrong. That's what I thought before I saw batman and robin. What I have learnt since watching the film is that you can destroy absolutely anything. Just like Batman and Robin almost destroyed the batman franchise. Let me explain. Now, you've got a really successful sequence of batman films, and you're probably looking for a star cast to really get this movie some attention. And Batman and Robin got attention all right and for a star cast. You can't go wrong with Arnold Schwartznegger as Mr Freeze and George Clooney as Batman. Well, actually you can! They were, in my opinion, the worst people for the job. The acting by George Clooney is absolutely terrible, so stiff and fake, and he doesn't look like he owns the screen. Now we all know Arnold Schwartznegger's history with movies. He plays usually tough, robotic and emotionless characters. So you would think that he wouldn't suit a role of Mr Freeze, who is deeply in love with his wife and is trying to find a cure for her disease, and who makes bad puns about ice, and who seems to want to just have a good time. Well you're right. He doesn't suit that role. So why did he get picked? So I've explained the bad acting. The script is a little better, although at times it is a little odd, with very obvious plot holes and random moments, which just make the movie even worse, which this movie can't afford. The moment where Barbara Wilson turns into Batgirl is even worse, and really the movie couldn't afford another random and cliché moment. Another part which is an obvious try at humor (which only, in the end, seems to disgust us) is when there are close-up shots of the three super-hero's in their close-fitting suits. It's disgusting and we didn't want to know! The Bat Credit Card scene is also up there with some of the most random scenes and worst jokes ever attempted. Let's just thank God that Heath ledger came along to save the day!",Batman & Robin
705,UltraVenom,Just re-watched it !,1,11 August 2008,"After seeing The Dark Knight a few weeks ago, I decided to re-watch the Original Batman movies, because I hadn't seen them in about three years. I own all the Batman films on DVD except Forever and this one. Just to point out I very seldom write reviews for movies I disliked, but this one is such a pile of garbage I couldn't resists. First off the problems I found with this movie is it crammed too many characters in it. My list of the flaws: 1. The movie didn't need three villains. Especially Bane, since they turned him into a mindless grunt that never speaks on his own accord, just repeats very word he hears. Man, I miss the Bane from the comics and Batman The Animated Series. Those Bane's where way better than this clown.2. Why did Joel decide to add in a lot of dumb sound effects like when Batman and Robin are getting dressed into their costumes you hear a lot of lame sounds. At many other scenes threw the movie they added more lame sounds. To name a few more like when Mr. Freeze freezes the Dinasaur statue in the Museum and it falls apart you hear a dinosaur's screech it sounded like. At the Wayne's Diamonds party when Mr. Freeze and his gang raid the place, Robin throws a tray at one of Mr. Freeze's thugs and trips him, another stupid sound that sounds like WHOOOP. I mean what where the makers of this movie thinking with adding crappy sounds to go in with scenes in the movie? 3. Too light and colorful for a Batman movie. Too many flashes of colors threw the movie it makes me feel like I was watching the Teletubies. 4. Too many stupid gadgets Batman and Robin used. Like the heat guns, bat heaters, and ice skates that pop out of their feet. I mean why would Batman and Robin even think to invent gadgets like this. How would they ever guess they would someday be going up against a Frozen man in a suit. Also after Batgirl defeats Poision Ivy and they all three go to the Obseritory to stop Mr. Freeze, where the heck did they get these new suits and vechiles so fast. I mean where they building these vechiles threw the movie. Why didn't we ever see them in any scenes until the end. It is like they just pop-ed up out of no where and have Ice proof vechiles and suits, very stupid. Again I must ask, What where the maker thinking?5. Batman/ Bruce Wayne had barely any character development in this movie at all. The only resemblance to the first 3 films we have are Bruce Wayne has flashbacks during the movie of when he was a kid. So this movie to me felt it was barely at all about Bruce Wayne or Batman. Instead it centers mostly around Mr. Freeze, Poision Ivy, and Robin liking Poision Ivy. 6. The movie had some of the worst acting I have ever scene it my life. George Cloony wasn't even trying. He sure wins the number #1 spot for the Worst Batman ever. 7. This movie didn't need Batgirl at all. Not to mention they screwed up her character from the comics. In the comics she wasn't Alfred's niece. Also her being in that Motorcyle race was so stupid. Another colorful scene. Also why would they race off half of a bridge? 8. Stupidest fight scenes of all the fighting in any Batman film. Also I noticed this movie had the least action of any of the movies.Well that completes my list of why this movie was so horrendous in my opinion. Batman Forever was just as bad. I'm confused which I thought was worse. This one might be, because at least most of Batman Forever had development for Bruce Wayne/ Batman. This movie and Forever where such Garbage I'm going to try and avoid them for the rest of my life. I will never watch either of them again. I will pretend they don't exist to me. I know they where planning to make another movie after this and where going to call it Batman Triumphant. But they pulled the plug on that movie, because of how bad this one was. Their is no way a 5th Batman would have ever worked after Forever and Batman and Robin. Don't watch this movie take my word you will just want your two hours back. Watch Tim Burton's first two instead. Or watch the Rebooted Batman Series. 1 out of 10",Batman & Robin
706,KyleH87,I never knew Schwarzenegger could drive me so crazy!,1,25 July 2008,"Ahhnold has had some pretty bad parts in movies before, but this one has to be his worst. Anybody who's read the Batman comics or seen the animated series knows that the Governator is not suitable for the part of Mr. Freeze. However, it really doesn't matter who would have played the part because the character's lines are written so terribly that it makes him seem like a total idiot rather than an intelligent scientist like he's supposed to be. Throughout the entire movie, he delivers enough cheesy puns to make you want to rip your hair out (""The ice man cometh!"", and ""Let's kick some ice!"" to name only a few). That alone makes the movie very hard to sit through without breaking the television set.The other elements of the movie aren't nearly as aggravating, but at the same time, they not very well done either. This movie reminds me a lot of the Fantastic Four movies, as well as many other lousy action movies of the past 10-15 years. It offers an endless amount of extremely far-fetched action sequences with paper-thin characters.The biggest problem with Batman & Robin is the screenplay and the storyline, which both seem like they were written by a five-year-old, and director Joel Schumacher is also to blame for allowing such terrible writing. The actors try their best to do well at their parts, but they're offered such awful dialog that doesn't mentally or emotionally lead them anywhere throughout the movie, and Joel Schumacher probably wasn't much of a help either, so I'm sure it was difficult for them to learn how to work their roles. George Clooney's Bruce Wayne/Batman goes through none of the emotional turmoil that Michael Keaton's, Val Kilmer's, and Christian Bale's do in the other Batman movies. Instead, he's always talking down to Robin, and Robin just keeps whining like a spoiled brat and complaining about the same things over and over (""I want a car!"", ""I want my own robin signal in the sky!"", ""I'm tired of always following you around, Batman!"").Another problem with this movie is that there are way too many characters, and there's not enough involvement or depth to any of the characters for us to really care about them. Alicia Silverstone is only in the film for about five minutes. I like Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy because she actually fits her part, unlike Arnold does for his, but all she pretty much does in the whole movie is blow perfume at all the men to make them fall in love with her. Bane is the biggest example of a character who is paper-thin and underused in the film. I've never read the Batman comics, and I don't remember Bane in the cartoon, but I'm pretty sure that the Bane character is meant to be more than how he's displayed in the movie as a giant Hulk Hogan figure who talks like a caveman.The bottom line is that Batman & Robin is very poorly done compared to all the other Batman films. The only positive comment I can make about it is that Alfred is involved in the story more than he usually is. I just watched this movie again for the first time in eleven years last night, and as you can see, I didn't like it too much. However, I remember enjoying it more when I was nine years old and I saw it in the theater. So if you're a child, then you might like this movie. You also might like it if you enjoy other sloppy action movies like Alien vs. Predator. Otherwise, unless you want to see how cheesy and irritatingly poor a Batman film can possibly be (this is even more cheesy than the T.V. show was), don't bother to add Batman & Robin to your Batman movie collection.",Batman & Robin

Yes even the nightmare that is ""Batman & Robin"".I was about 2 years old when Batman & Robin came on to the big screen and I just had to see it. I begged my father to take me to see the movie, and with him being a big Batman fan as well, almost instantly agreed.Lets be honest; The acting in Batman & Robin is horrible. Arnold is horrible as Mr. Freeze and Clooney wouldn't even make my list for a possible Batman, let alone star in this one. I HATE Alicia Silverstone, I think she is ghastly, just dreadful. I do admit to liking Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and the whiny bitch that is Chris O'Donnell. He really is a decent Robin, I give him credit for that.The writing is a joke in itself. All the ice puns, Bane as a complete and utter fool, ""rubber lips"", the fact that B&R have Ice Skates in there suits, everything is just horrible. The Alfred story would have been actually pretty decent if they weren't so damn campy through the whole movie.And even after I said all of this: I still love Batman & Robin. Yes, I just admitted to loving this awful creation, why? Because its fun to watch. Because I don't take it seriously. Because it brings happy thoughts from my childhood, Idk, I just love the movie. Its bad, awful maybe. But still, I like it.So Batman & Robin I give a 4/10 because it gives me a sense of joy watching Arnold scream ""YOUR NOT SENDING ME TO THE COOLER"" ha-ha.",Batman & Robin
708,Flavianomatos,Best Batman ever!,10,12 January 2017,"This is the best Batman ever. The story looks like it comes directly from a comic book. The introduction of Batgirl to the team is a nod to the Silver Age comic book era. The photography resembles comic books also, with the colors you'd expect from a comic book. The dialogue and action are not very serious, this movie does not take itself so serious, it's fun and a little cheesy, as if Schumacher had taken inspiration from 1960s Batman and Robin. Indeed, Batman & Robin tries to make homage to 1960s era Batman live action series, and cartoon, while not undoing what Tim Burton had made in 1989's Batman. That's the best possible combination of both stiles of Batmen, the Burton's claustrophobia nightmare, and the colorful cheesiness of 1960s comic books.",Batman & Robin

How could I?I sat there wondering whether or not to try to drown myself in my $3.50 medium soda (which yes, everyone has made perfectly clear that 25 cents more would buy me the tub size).I wanted to end the pain, the misery, but I was only 25 minutes into the worst torture of my life . . . watching George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger trade off one liners.Arnold was the worst: ""Everybody freeze"" ""Hey Batman, Chill out"" ""It doesn't work on the cold hearted"" ""Always winterize your pipes""I'm sure glad he had a cold reference in every line because I was really unsure he was Mr. freeze and not one of the gladiators from Running Man (ya know, like Dynamo, the human Las Vegas Strip).Clooney practically burst into fits of laughter upon saying Alfred (you know, the one who actually attempted to act) was dying.  Too bad the audience was already dead at this point - the first real casualty of the movie.Add Chris O'Donnel, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, some action, a sad pathetic attempt at a plot, stir and serve to dopes like me who paid to see it.",Batman & Robin

I pity the poor souls who paid to see this trash. You realize that Arnold's best movies are the ones where he is only required to grunt and that whom ever wrote and directed this film should have their screen writers and screen director's guild cards taken away.

Anyone who paid to see it should join a class action to recover damages against the filmmakers.Lousy acting from great actors. And some of the worst -- perhaps the worst -- set design ever. The plot is a grab bag, literally. A little of this, a little of that. No particular rationale behind any of it. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall as the cast watched the film. Every single one must have thought, ""It can't get any worse than this.""The most amazing thing of all: Director Joel Schumacher has actually been entrusted with directing jobs after this.",Batman & Robin
712,freddiedeighton,The Lost Potential,2,3 August 2013,"Now, I am a huge fan of DC Comics - especially the Batman universe - and looking at that factor, you may think that that means I may have a soft spot for this horrid excuse for a movie. Well, my dear reader, are quite mistaken! The fact that I am a excessive reader of Batman comics and player of Batman games, leads me to hate this film even more than someone who just watched it because they thought all Batman films would be like the Dark Knight!Something that really appalled me about this film is that the merchandise that was sold due to the release of the film was not spawned from the movie. No, no, in fact, the movie was spawned from the merchandise! That's right! Some bigwig toy makers asked themselves; how can we sell our Batman toys...hmmm....let's make a ludicrous movie which doesn't take any of the character's back stories in to consideration!OK, I lied a little there! The movie does provide an origins story for Pamela Isley/Poison Ivy - which, surprisingly, is quite true to the comics - and Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze is trying to save his lost wife, Nora - as he does in the comics! But the other villain in this movie, Bane, has had his entire mythos flushed down a toilet! Thankfully, 14 years later, the wonderful Christopher Nolan managed to provide us with a true depiction of Bane in the Dark Knight Rises. Unfortunately, in Batman & Robin, he is depicted as a brain-dead junkie. Nothing like the cunning and cruel criminal mastermind seen the comics and as portrayed by Tom Hardy.What is disgustingly wrong about Schumacher's Batman finale is it's cast! George Clooney could possibly be the worst actor they could have picked to play the Caped Crusader. It may have seemed like a good idea at the time, seeing as though he is our world's equivalent of Bruce Wayne. So, maybe, just maybe, he managed to pull off the billionaire playboy, since that's just who he is. But, the most important thing to consider when playing such a character as Bruce Wayne/Batman, is that his personality changes quite dramatically when he puts on the Bat-suit, he becomes a dark, mysterious creature of the night, he doesn't just stay as his charming self. This, however, is what George Clooney does do...so anyone who this Bruce for maybe about 10 minutes and then just must Batman all of a sudden, would only be able to differ between the two due to the suit. Oh, and don't even get me started on the infamous nipple suit!Arnie as Mr. Freeze is just the same as Clooney playing the Bat; it may seem like a good idea at the time, because has a single element of the character in them - he's Austrian, Freeze is a doctor...stereo-type - but in actual fact, he was probably the worst actor they could have picked! Chris O'Donnel's Dick Grayson/Robin is probably the most 2-D, generic character in the movie; he's an arrogant sidekick who thinks he's better than his master and eventually leaves him to do stuff on his own - haven't heard THAT story before (!). Tim Burton's Batman was a revolution in Batman's media, before 1989, all Batman was on the screen was a big joke thanks to the overweight Adam West with his ZOCKS and THWAPS and the pretty camp Burt Ward with his ""Holy whatever I just couldn't' really give a monkey's, Batman!"". When Joel Schumaher took over from Tim, Batman was brought back to that (Batman Credit Card? Come ON!). However, if it wasn't for this movie, Christopher wouldn't have thought that Batman needed to be redeemed and we wouldn't be where we are today in the DC universe, with a Batman/Superman film coming in 2015, so excited!! Just for this, Batman & Robin gets one more star than it should!People who will enjoy this: Children under 8People who won't enjoy this: DC Comics fans, those who enjoyed the Dark Knight Trilogy, lovers of Batman's myhtos, movie fans",Batman & Robin
713,aburgin43,uggh!,1,20 July 2008,"Batman and Robin is pretty much the low point of the summer blockbuster. I mean, how do you bastardize acting talent such as George Clooney and Uma Thurman? Put them in goofy costumes, give them a script without a single sentence of meaningful dialogue, and then team them up with Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, arguably some of the worst actors in American film. There is so much wrong with this movie, from the awful script to the terrible action sequences, the campy computerized sets ... what else can I say. Then they go and try to save the movie by sending Alfred's character to near death? What a cheap way to try to save a movie!!!! I remember when the movie was being advertised in theaters. I got excited, just like any fan of the Batman series. I believe I almost threw up after the movie, if I am not mistaken. How do you make a bad Batman movie? I didn't think it was possible.

However, when I saw it the other day for the first time in years, I realized just how stupid I was as a child. I really tried to give this movie another chance, but it just doesn't live up to the other Batman movies. Schumacher really let us down when he was making this. The acting, the script, the directing, everything was not as good as it could have been. I felt like, not only the casting was wrong, but also the dialog between the characters. Too many cheesy lines is a bad thing! Especially on Freeze's behalf, lay off the cheesy one-liners!

Just like Returns the casting is bad and not in a good way. Clooney is the worst actor to ever play the caped crusader. He seems to play him like James Bond and that is not who Batman is. O'Donnell plays Robin like a little punk kid and you will wish he would die a slow death. Silverstone is even worse I mean what the hell were they thinking of when they cast her as Batgirl. She is chubby and has a mustache and is clueless (insert pun) in the movie. Don't even get me started on Schwarzenegger, this was in my mind the worst casting of the movie. Next time hire an actor not a one-liner machine. Mr.Freeze is one of the best villains ever and got screwed in the movie. Thurman is the only one who gives a decent performance as the sexy Poison Ivy. The movie has to much Batman 60's camp for me. I mean come on bat skates and bat credit cards why. The movie has good effects and some cool (insert pun) chase scenes, but has to much holding it back.

You have to be blind or even deaf to like this movie, or both! It is the worst representation of who Batman is. A comic book is better than this. Mr. Freeze wasn't a cool villain to start with and they made him worse with his stupid cheesy lines and his plastic chrome costume. Poison Ivy is supposed to be sexy but they managed to make her look like green alien, she wears a cheap cotton costume and blows some sort of essence into men's faces one to many times. George Clooney is a cool and calm Bruce Wayne but he is not so great at being batman. Robin is not so bad and bat girl is totally useless. Joel is a very bad director and he ruinedbatman.

720,gregsaxton,How to kill a superhero in 125 minutes,1,27 June 2005,"Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Where to start? OK, 'Batman Forever'was a great disappointment but the entire saga could still have been saved. But no. Goldsman (writer) made sure that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. The marketing department made a mistake with the film's tag-line. It read:'Strength. Courage. Honor. And loyalty. On June 20, it ALL comes together...' when it should have said: Bad acting. Weak script that relies on puns. Suits with nipples. And Batcreditcards. On June 20, it ALL falls apart...' However, Batman never leaving home without it should have been the least of his worries. When Michael Keaton went to see this film he must have left the cinema in tears. The movie caries on from 'Batman Forever', where Batman now has his sidekick Robin. The movie also introduces Batgirl, played by Alicia Silverstone, towards the end of the movie. In an interview about the film, Clooney said that he had wanted to show that Bruce Wayne was moving on from his parents' deaths, thinking fondly of their lives rather than remembering how they died. What a load of crap. Mr and Mrs Wayne's deaths are Batman's motivation for fighting crime in the first place. Without this he's just an idiot in a rubber outfit, sometimes called 'George Clooney'. Chris O'Donnell gives a mediocre performance as Robin, not really bringing anything to the character. We get no sense of history, none of the dark brooding mystery that surrounded Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Ever faithful to the Batman films is Michael Gough, playing Wayne's butler Alfred. But even he gets dragged into the puns; 'I'll cancel the pizza, sir' he says as Batman goes zooming off in the worst Batmobile to date. Even the cartoon version was better than that one. Arnie was there as well, though there really isn't much to comment on to be honest. He was just Arnold Schwarzenegger, doing what Arnold Schwarzenegger does. The only decent major part in the entire film came from Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Admittedly she gave her villain style and a slight sense of insanity, however nobody could match Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. So, after unsuccessfully demanding my money back from the cinema cashier, I knew that Batman could not have any more sequels, especially if the current Robin and Batgirl were to be present. It's shame. Thank god for 'Begins'...",Batman & Robin

This movie took a huge turn from Batman (1989) and Batman Returns; l understand the direction of the film to mimic a comic book style, but when you slap in some cartoon sound effects, HORRIBLE acting, and terrible direction, you just get one giant mess of a movie. I'm going to give special effects a pass, being that this movie is 19 years old (but they were still pretty horrible). This movie was truly painful to watch, however, if you don't take it seriously, you will actually be able to laugh at how bad the film is. You know those movies that are just so bad, it's so good (ex. Birdemic)? This is literally one of those movies, except this one is high budget.

723,Dark_gollum713,Holy cheese Batman!!(possible spoilers),2,3 August 2005,"Holy Cheese Batman!! This seems to be something that Robin would say to Batman in the 4th installment of the Batman series. This movie comes off the success of Batman Forever(while although cheesy, the jokes in it do not fall as flat as the ones in Batman and Robin.) In Batman Forever and all of the other Batman movies the villains actually had chemistry with each other. Not so in this movie I am afraid to say. Arnold Schwarzeneger as usual completely overacts in this movie as does Uma Thurman. The Plot leaves something to be desired(In my opinion the worst plot of the series.) It is about Poison Ivy, who may not be that great of a villain to begin with. She uses the same kind of gas that the Joker(portrayed brilliantly by Jack Nicholson in the first Batman)to a different and utterly laughable effects. It seems the most harm she can do is to seduce some of Gotham's highest citizens and then with her kiss of death kill them(unless of course you bring your rubber lips for the fight, even though you were completely under her spell not 2 seconds before-hand.) Arnold was miserably type-casted for this movie, throwing out more puns then last week's garbage. While he may be a huge movie star what we needed was a good actor. Don't even get me started on Batgirl's character who seemed completely unnecessary to the story line(It seemed the only reason she was there was because of typical feminists who don't to see men be the only ones fighting crime in the movies.) George Clooney could possibly have been the worst role for Batman, ever. We didn't need a sarcastic actor to play one of the more serious roles in the series. One of the only cool sequences in the entire movie is when you enter Arkham Asylum and see the Riddler's and Catwoman's Costumes from the previous movies. Sloppy action does not make a good movie. Neither does corny dialog and campy performances. Save the turkey until Thanksgiving and don't watch this movie. 2/10",Batman & Robin

The man can barely speak a word of English. Even George W. would have been more appropriate for the role of Mr. Freeze. I mean it. And then, George Clooney. I respect the man, loved him in many of his movies but him as Batman? Didn't see it then, don't see it now. He neither has the face nor can he pull the attitude of a hero off. ""I'm Batman."" No you're not. Uma Thurman, please. She was never a good actress, she should thank her lucky star named Tarantino for getting roles at all, much less roles in high budget movies. Alicia Silverstone, the end. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson? The man who will later become Nightwing? Holy miscasting, Batman! Many people give Uwe Boll a hard time, but all he does is make movies (with the sad exception called Alone In The Dark) that are fun to watch precisely BECAUSE they're terrible. But this...

In fact, the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw Batman & Robin. A friend of mine came to my house a few years back. He burst through the door and slammed the DVD onto my bed. I had heard of the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty awful. So, having the expectations to want to kill myself after it, I reluctantly watched it. When the final credits rolled and the sun glazed upon my bed sheets, both of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Louie and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.

How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the puns in this movie are flawless as well, and the loyalty to the early years of batman make it a ""must buy"" for any comic book fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theatre, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""

730,TheDarkPhoenix85,"Wow, what an embarrassment.",1,19 November 2006,"I never thought a movie like this would ever be made. But it did. Back in 1997, the Batman series had taken an unexpected turn. Joel Schumacher returns to his second BM film since 1995's Batman Forever. Schumacher infuses as much camp and colorful action-packed set-pieces as possiblewhile lacking some artistic merit, or character canons that has made Tim Burton's rendition of the original Batman series such a success. This film just seems more like a toy commercial. Who can fill in a ""Bat-suit"" that's horribly enhanced with nipples? Could anyone imagine which actor today in their right mind would be caught dead wearing this suit-- what is now known as the ""Gayest costume"" in movie history? Well, gosh darn it folks, this would be the back- then TV ""heartthrob"" George Clooney of the TV series ""ER."" Heck, you would've deserve a pat on the shoulder if you were 12 years-old being introduced to your first glimpse of a satire filled with ""sexual references"" of gay jokes delivered all on screen in this blooper-buster. All in all, let's skip on to the point. I swear to you, you would take this seriously as not an assumption, but the honest truth.George Clooney is not the best freakin' ""Batman"" out there; and is probably the worst ever cast in the BM series. I mean, whose idea was it to try to fuse in Clooney's ""ER"" routine to Bruce Wayne as if the playboy billionaire was induced to six-years of Medical school? I don't recall Mr. Wayne being such a talkative scholar on human diseases. And that wasn't what I expected from him this time. I wanted to see this man whoop some evil doer's' ass, not talk like he spends time in the surgery room. He comes off come off as nerdy, charming, dull and annoying.Chris O'Donnell is ""hot"" reprising his role as the hot-headed boy-wonder ""Robin."" Compared to Johnny Storm / Human Torch of the ""Fantastic Four"", he's reduced to a annoying childish, hot-headed and stubborn. But with such childishness, Bruce now has to put up with a 20-something child instead of a side-kick to help him fight crime. At least now, Robin's job is to ride around town with ""Batman"" on a motorcycle and bitch about not having his freedom like a teenage rebel who was told he was grounded. If that was the case, then Alfred should've gotten stuck with the baby-sitting job and start day-care center and ended it from there (rolls her eyes). Adding a new edition to the dynamic-duo would mean giving the teammate a new female presence. That's when Batgirl comes. The super-heroine was reduced to a blonde chick played by Alicia Silverstone who has no clue on how to work a cat suit. is For one thing, I didn't take her seriously as ""Bat-Girl"". And the fact that she doesn't display the characteristics that the heroine has nor has the physical features to match. She just comes across as cute and stiffwhile adding some bimbo action to the ""Dynamic duo""but that's not like I'm saying Alicia is a ""bimbo"", but that's how it was written here. The villains are a Duo of cartoon-ish overblown megalomaniacs. Starting with Arnold ""get into the chopper"" Schwarzenegger as the ""epitome"" for what is wrong in casting a villain. As Mr. Freeze, his heavy Austrian accent throws me off a lot, cheesy one-liners makes him seem less menacing roll. But making him the top billed actor of the cast is questionable; considering he's not the ""main"" character, nor is he the main star.Uma Thurman deserves a ""Razzie"" for her role as the plant-loving pseudo-seductress ""Poison Ivy,"" and I wouldn't blame anyone for casting the votes because Uma's acting at times is annoyingly overwrought and overbearing. Everything and everyone seems to have been reduced from their normal comic-book tone or state. Or as I would put it clearly; is as paper-thin as the pages of the comics. And why not bother to go into the plot? I guess I'm too lazy to. And the fact that there is no distinguished plot to begin with. The writing is nothing but a story crafted with a shoulder shrug. So why bother to take up too much time griping about it and its mind-numbing ness. But hey, at least Joel Schumacher gave the movie some sort of action-packed charisma, the only good thing to invest on it, but not much to be impressed about.

733,lordfaunswater,if i could give it nil points i would do. 1 at best.,1,16 February 2006,"I was 9 when i saw this film. As it goes, i hated every minute of it. Batman should not be camp! SHOULD NOT BE! I CRIED so hard. When you compare Clooney's dismal portrayal with that of Keaton, Keaton wins hands down. And as for Arnie, he should not be allowed near a positon of authority for this travesty of a film. The last time i saw it, i could hear his Austrian accent saying ""ICE TO SEE YOU"" and other select puns for hours afterwords. PLEASE, please, please. Burn all copies of this film. Do not watch it. Ever. IT IS CURSED, and all the cast, and crew who where involved should be crucified. In conclusion :utter crap. watch the first instead.",Batman & Robin
734,chrisoutram,What was Mr Clooney thinking................,1,28 March 2006,"Let me just say before my review of Batman And Robin that i am a fan of the previous Batman films and that i had never watched this one due to the bad press etc, but my son is now of the age where he is into superhero films and wanted this for his birthday, well i am just glad no one bought me this for my birthday. Is this the same George Clooney who just won an Oscar for best supporting actor, can Arnie really be this bad, well the answer to both those questions is of course yes, and never in my wildest dreams would i of thought anyone could do such a bad job of a Batman movie.Let's start with the set, while impressive it may be to my 4 yr old son, this is one of the worst backdrops for a so called blockbuster movie i have ever seen, rubber icicles that you can see wobbling when the cop shuts his car door, so much fluorescent lighting that you may need sunglasses to watch it and way over the top architectural type buildings or giant plastic heads to put it another way. But what really makes this movie bad is the wooden acting and the poor script, i have never cringed so much at one liners like i did with this movie, but it does help to have good actors to deliver them. But don't get me wrong, i am a big Clooney fan but this is one role he should never have done, he just ain't no Batman, and his performance in Killer Tomatoes was better than this, and as for Alicia Silverstone please tell me what was the point, of course there was none, just another big name to add to the cast, Chris O'donnell also surprised me after doing Batman Forever you would think he would never take part in another one, and as for Arnie, his performance as Mr Freeze would have to go down as one of the worst of all time.Uma Thurman was OK i suppose and Alfred the butler was the best actor in it, and as for Elle Macpherson, again pointless.So to sum up, here we have a movie with no real plot, no real point,no real script, no good acting and a visual car crash thats great for little kids, in fact this film should be rated 10, meaning not suitable for anyone over the age of 10.",Batman & Robin

Many feel that this movie and Batman Forever were ""OK"", those people have become lost to any notions of taste or reasoning and deserve to be mocked!I would also like to mention that this marks the lowest points in the careers of George Clooney and Arnold Shwarzenegger, and their first films were ""Return of the Killer Tomatoes"" and ""Hercules Goes Bananas in New York"" respectively. The only actor I forgive for this abomination is the guy who played Alfred, at least he stayed in character.People keep defending this steaming pile of a movie by blamming the writers. I would blame the writer too, but they probably wouldn't hear me, being far too busy eating small children and beating up nuns. Joel Shoemacker is on my hit list too. How could a director whose work I have really enjoyed up until his run in with the Batman films have become such a corporate whore!? How does he sleep at night on that large pile of money? Maybe Satan himself cuddles up with him and sings him to sleep. Maybe that's how he got the bright idea to shoot half the film in frickin' neon!!!The main reason to hate this movie is that five or six quality films could have been produced by WB instead. Such a vast waste of time and resources is sickening, especially when there are peole all over the world who starve or freeze to death. Maybe that was the message this film was trying to get across, that we should forget about Batman because all these people are freezing because of the diamond hungry Mr. Freeze who represents capitalism and corrupt governments?

I know that a lot of kids enjoyed the movie and I can respect that.However, I am quite certain that those children who enjoyed this movie could have been just as, if not more entertained by a better-made Batman film that didn't insult the general public's intelligence.There are no words that exist in the English language that can express just how awful this movie was.  I regret that I spent $7.25 and about two hours, which I will never get back, to watch this movie.  Even the Batman animated series has far more quality and intelligence than this waste of $100 million.  Hell, I'd say the same for the Batman TV series with Adam West.I don't even know why anyone would want to rent or buy this movie on video.

Now that was a complete waste of money. Its probably the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. For example; the scene where Batman and Robin chase baddies, in an museum that has almost completely been frozen to ice, on iceskates. What where they thinking? It looks more like ""Disney on ice"".I wonder what was going on in Joel Schumacher's head when he was directing this movie. Sure, ""8mm"", wasn't too good, but it sure was a hell of a lot better. Where did he dig up that horrible scenery? It looks like something taken from a lame comic book. The atmosphere in Tim Burton's Batman movies was really awesome, but this??? Watching this movie feels like slamming your head against a cement wall. Painful in other words.Some movies are so bad that they become good, ""Plan 9 from outer space"" for example. ""Batman & Robin"" isn't so bad that it's good. Oh no, it's even worse. I would rather see my local dental surgeon and get my roots filled than see this piece of worm doodie again.",Batman & Robin

The surfing in the sky sequence is very un-Batmanish in my view. I didn't care for the Batman credit card deal, either. George Clooney is probably a very gifted actor, but, he was a bad choice for this film. If you enjoyed the prior Batman movies, you probably will not care for this one. On the other hand, if you did not like the other Batman films, this one may appeal to you. I guess my expectations were not met by this film, and that colors my view of virtually all aspects of it.

Sure, he murdered the depth of certain characters and made a lot of weird additions. So what? If you're here to simply get entertained, then Batman and Robin has the perfect formula in place.

Barbara is suppose to be the commissioner's daughter, not Alfred's niece, and Batgirl is suppose to have red hair! The only good things are Chris O' Donnell, the Batmobile, and Batman disabling the engine of the Redbird (Robin's motorcycle) and Batman commands Robin to jump, but Robin didn't make the jump, so he just stands on the hand of a giant statue and shout in a rage.

No good plot, or real substance, just a bit of a joke. One of my personal highlights was when they have ice skates ready in their shoes and when Robin falls into Nickelodeon slime.Overall silly film with no substance, too many things introduced at once, not even screen time for each character so their arcs progress slowly.

The story framework was a bad rehash of Batman Forever, the sets and special effects looked cheap (like the car chase scene that looked like it was done with Matchbox cars), the plot was weak and contrived, and the premise of Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy teaming up was ludicrous.  Turning Bane into a mindless grunt was a travesty to comic book fans.

751,Skungy_Jim,not all bad... not all good either,10,23 March 2002,"where to begin, batman and robin, the movie that could've been the biggest, boldest batman movie to date.  Sure it had bold set pieces, a fairly good looking and character motivated cast, but where was the batman essence - Batman, from the earlier movies and the comics was a mysterious figure who walked the night seving justice to the fair citizens of gotham - but in this movie he cruises around making public appearences - that just isn't batman. George clooney was an ok batman - not the best but not the worst (if you don't count acting), Micheal keaton still holds the trophy.As far as set pieces went it was all too ""lord of the rings"" giant statues which lined the city skyline and gotham observatory was just plain rediculous.  The other moives captured Gotham's gothic feel - but never when too extreams to create a city that was... very... er crappy.The character of Robin was just a pain - in the comics he was a young man struggling with his ideantity, yada yada - but in this movie he is a self riotous brat.  Chris o'donnel was great for Batman Forever - but in this one his emotions consist of pubescent wining and bratty showman ship.Batgirl was great - a little corney but she was great,  Alicia silverstone can pull off nearly anyroll she has to date.  Batgirl, however was not ""Batgirl"" she was some ring about motorcycle rider from Alfred's past.The villians were good - better then the riddler and two face - not as good as catwoman and the penguin or the joker but up there with them.  Mow, Arnold Swartzenegga (or how you spell it) was an unusual choice for Mr Freeze sure he wore the costume well and his acting for the role (giving there isn't much you can do for a love sick psycho) was great but he just seemed out of place - and his dialogue was a little corney.Poison Ivy was hot, hot, hot Uma had the seductive temptress down pat. Her costumes her flashy and vibrant (not all good for a batman movie)once again she wasn't given much to work with and her lines mainly appeared to be her thinking out aloud.Bane... ARRGGGGGGGHHHHH don't go there bane was THE WORST villian in anything - his part was suited (ivy's heavy) but the whole concept of his presense really destroyed the villain's charisma.  In the comics Bane is a power hungry murderer bent on taking gotham - in the movie his is a dweebish creep injected with venom and he turns into super green skinned fatty with ""Grrrrrrr's"" as his dialogue.The companionship between the villains wasketchy at best and i don't think it worked out quite as well as they'd (scriptwriters) planned.  but by the end it all appeared to fit in (not really but what else can ya do)Over all the movie was fairley good - its pros were the villains (no, not bane), the touching sub plot with a dying alfred (what off you ask... i cannot say) the fact the Mr Freeze wasn't really a villains - just wanted to save his wife was rather unique compared to the others down the track... but the cons (and there were many) included - the overtly fanatical gotham - too big, too bright, too high, too stupidly created, the ending (not the defeat of the villains but the end end) - too soppy, the introduction scene with mr freeze in the museum - too corney, the actors dialogue - too corney as well and much much more.The movie could've worked, but it failed in so many areas it just didn't have the spark of the batman we know and love - it was an enjoyable movie but just, well was more than comic and returned to the s***ty style cornish in uendo batman that never appealed to our generation",Batman & Robin
752,justin2819,Robbed on Oscar Night???,1,23 June 2002,"Robbed on Oscar Night???? Batman & Robin was the feel good movie of 1997. Lets face it, Joel Schumacher is a creative genius. The way he was able to pull such master performances out of Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Clooney was simply amazing. Clooney was the epitome of a great Batman character. He is dark, mysterious, and filled with an inner rage, a passion for justice that ellicits chills down the spine of his viewers. The success of the movie cannot just be attributed to its cast however, as Akiva Goldsman penned out a masterpiece. Teaming evil botanist Poisen Ivy with mad scientist Mr. Freeze was bold, daring and ultimately successful. These two villains have such chemistry that its hard to take your eyes off them. The conclusion of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, the angry performance of Arnold as he proclaims that he will freeze the world was just a little to real for me. I felt like I was right there with the action and going to be a victim of this new impending ice age. No movie since Citizen Kane, The Godfather, or Schindler's List has been able to develop a plot and character as Schumacher does here. Hats off to Warner Bros for giving this movie the go ahead and releasing one of the top ten of all time in my opinion. Why, oh why, did Clooney get screwed on Oscar Night?",Batman & Robin
753,Kashmir384,One of the most underrated movies of our time,7,1 April 2008,"People need to understand what Joel Schumacher did with this movie, intentionally or not... made an extremely funny film. I'm not comparing this to Shawshank or A Clockwork Orange, but none the less this is an incredible piece of film.This may be one of Schwarzenegger's most dynamic roles(excluding Kindergarten Cop). You can see some emotion in his character, instead of the normal robotic monster killing tank he always is, and the puns were incredible...INCREDIBLE. Schwarzenegger single handedly made this one of the best bad movies I have seen in ages.Uma was great as Ivy, I often found myself wondering how Robin could resist her for so long. Her accent may have been a little over the top, but it matched the movie and made it even better. However I feel that they could have put a little more work into her sidekick Bane, who I feel was put in the movie just to use a beauty and the beast reference.The writing was decent, I burst out laughing every time a character blurted out another ridiculous pun. Quotes such as ""Ice to meet you,"" ""Adam and Evil,"" and ""Let's kick some ice!"" made me laugh well after the credits rolled.When batman uses his grappling hook to climb the building I almost thought they gave him the ability to fly, and at that point in the movie I wouldn't have put it past Schumacher to do so. I think the only thing that could have made this movie any more absurd and entertaining would be to cast Robin Williams as Alfred and give him a ten minute monologue. There were a few problems though. This was by no means Clooney's finest hour, and although she fit the movie perfectly, Uma Thurman has definitely acted better. As I said, this movie is NOT, I repeat NOT a thinker.

756,depastino,Utter garbage...,2,3 April 2003,"Sigh. I was SO looking forward to this movie when it first came out. After stomaching Val Kilmer in Batman 3, I thought George Clooney would be a HUGE improvement. Boy, was I ever wrong. This movie was a total disaster from beginning to end. Let's start with Clooney as Batman. First off, Batman is supposed to be the antithesis of Bruce Wayne. Batman is HARDCORE. Batman is unbeatable one on one. Batman is Bruce Wayne's Mr. Hyde. Keaton figured that much out in his portrayal. Batman and Bruce Wayne are two separate characters and should be treated as such by the actor. Clooney played Bruce Wayne the WHOLE movie. No one wants to see Bruce Wayne in a Batman suit! Where's the edge? Where's the intimidation? Thugs should have two basic attitudes toward Batman: 1.Knee-knocking, lip-quivering, bowel-loosening panic, or 2. the ""let's see how good you really are"" mentality. Batman is supposed to be the baddest man on the planet and every crook knows it. B&R never shows this. Clooney either didn't get it, or was told to soften him up for easier mass-consumption. Either way, he comes off as a touchy-feely panty-waist who villains view as an mere annoyance rather than a force to be dealt with. And what the heck happened to BANE? If you remember Bane from the comics, you'll remember that he actually defeated (and crippled) Batman forcing him to find a replacment for himself. Bane deserved to be a focal movie adversary in his own right. To turn him into Ivy's flunky was an unforgivable blunder, a total waste of a possible sequel idea and completely UNNECESSARY. The movie would've been just as lousy without him. This movie was a jumbled confusing mess. There were too many characters used for there to be any solid development of ANY of them. Batgirl and Bane were simply tossed into the mix without any good reason for them being there. The constant bickering between Batman and Robin was absurd, pointless and totally out of character for Robin. He never shows an ounce of gratitude toward Bruce Wayne and comes across as a snotty, disrespectful jerk. The big action scenes are ridiculous to the point of being funny. Batman and Robin is just a miasma of stupidity and nothing like what a Batman movie should be. Don't waste your time!",Batman & Robin

I will break down the movie into parts. For characters, the movie fell flat, even George Clooney couldn't help this abomination. Uma Thurman for pretty much a sex-appeal kind of thing, and was a little sub-par for a villain. The Governator as Mr. Freeze wasn't a terrible idea, but almost everything he says has to do with ice, or the cold. Robin was pouty, and sucked balls, Bat-girl only appeared at the end, and didn't really do anything. This movie went beyond campy, the lighting is all weird, there are to many one liners, and it takes away all that Batman should be, a vigilante. Now he's a flashy superhero with campy, over the top sidekicks straight out of a kindergarten coloring book. The plot is just dumb, Mr. Freeze tries to bring his wife back, and I can't even remember what Poison Ivy wanted to do. Also, Alfred is slowly dying, the highlight of the film, but that's not saying much, that's like if Batman got AIDS, that would be the highlight of the film, it sucks. The absolute suckishness of this horrendous movie cannot be explained, just go out and rent it. By the way, I love campy stuff, and i love the old Batman TV series, but this movie sucks balls.

760,trans_peace,Funny movie if you know that its a joke,5,4 August 2011,"Well, I first saw this movie at a young age and I loved it. The Villains were flashy and impressive for me at 5 years old and the colors were very catchy, plus, Poison Ivy was (and still is) pretty good looking. When my friend and I started talking about that movie 12 years later, I decided to dust it off and see if the movie was THAT bad (like everyone on the internet told me it was). After watching the movie for a second time (now at the age of 17), I realized that the movie wasn't supposed to be serious. At first, I thought it was a cartoon in live action format and Im pretty sure it is. Of course this movie is the type of movie you need to leave your brain at the door if you want to have some fun watching it. I understand why I loved it as a little boy, its funny when you don't expect a masterpiece and just enjoy the picture. If I'm saying that this movie is a joke its because of first the story,then the villains, the overall look of the movie and finally the good guys. I feel like the story is too short for a 2 hours movie, thats why I say that I think its a parody of old Batman episodes, and they decided to do an whole movie about it... The villains are great!! But they are too funny for a serious Batman film. My favorite villain in this movie is Poison Ivy, she's a Femme fatal, seductive but deadly... and as a kid I loved the overall look of Uma Thurman as Ivy....love that stuff !! The overall look of the movie is very colorful for a batman movie (except for the vintage ones) and a serious Batman movie is not supposed to be THAT flashy (I think). Batman and Robin in the movie are not serious AT ALL. When Robin yells KAWABUNGAAAAAA !!! while falling is a good example of jokes that makes this movie a parody of old Batman episodes (remember the 1960's TV show). Robin in this movie is practically always acting funny, like the old Batman TV show. So... Batman and Robin does not deserve to be destroyed like he is right now, I think its a parody for many reasons and that people were expecting a sequel more mature and thats why a lot of fans and people in general don't like it. Still, they are some parts that are annoying even if we know that its not a serious film, that doesn't help but If you want to love that movie, think of it as a joke and be a child again and you'll enjoy it as it is.",Batman & Robin
761,emarriott72,"A campy, silly, comedy",5,24 August 2011,"This movie has been called one of the worst of all time. This is a movie you should just stop thinking and just watch. This can't be considered a serious attempt at an action movie. This is a comedy, it surpasses the camp quality of the sixties show. I might as well give you a quick rundown of the other Batman movies. In 1966 Batman the movie came out. It's pretty silly but is still fun to watch and is even better with a group. But fans wanted a darker Batman, and sure enough, a new director came to the stand, Tim Burton. He directed in 1989 Batman, which was darker and more edgy, and it was a big hit. Of course a sequel was made, and Burton now could do whatever he wanted with this one. Again, dark and edgy, but it was much and Burton was booted off. Joel Shmacher took over and made Batman Forever. This time it was more child friendly, and was also a hit, creating yet another sequel.Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, A.K.A Batman and Robin, battle a new foe, Mr.Freeze, whose only weapon is saying bad one liners. Quickly he teams up with the villainous Poison Ivy and Bane. Meanwhile, one of Alfred's (Bruce Waynes butler)niece visits and thinks something strange at Wayne manor. That's it, that's the entire plot. Wow, I feel so unexcited...I mean this movies so bad Joel Shumacher apologized for making it. Heck they even had a sequel to this planned...This movie caused 8 years of no Batman it was so bad. The acting is atrocious, the story is lame, and it's just all around bad! Arnold Shrarsonegger's robotic acting is only appropriate in the Terminator, and thats it! George Clooney's a good choice for Bruce Wayne, I could definitely picture as rich billionaire, but the movies so silly, I don't even care. But like I said, it's a comedy, it's required to be in the right mood to watch.",Batman & Robin
762,ajmart,Wasted Hour and a Half,2,1 September 2011,"Honestly, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Joel Schumacher took a great movie franchise that Tim Burton revolutionized and took s*** all over it. The choices he made for actors were awful. George Cloony, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thermon were all terribly cast, and, while they can be great, were all terrible! Only Arnold Schwarzenegger, who I have to admit is usually a bad actor, was the only enjoyable actor in this movie for his over-the-top acting. The visuals, which in the Burton versions were stylish, were hokey and stupid. The dialog seemed to have been written by a ten year old. The first line of ""I wanna car, chicks dig the car"" and Arnold's constant ice puns will kill all expectations. The story is also a complete load. Gone is the mysterious Batman, and we are left with a largely pubic icon. The subplots are stupid as well, because now were left to care about what happens to the butler, and his idiot niece is stupid too. The appearances of the Bat Nipples, Bat Bung Hole, and Bat Credit Card don't help either. So, if you can't already tell, stay away from this god**** movie.",Batman & Robin
763,ruks-mail,"If ""Batman Begins"" can possibly be worse, I'd like to know how.",2,5 March 2005,"And not because it's a BAD film, per se. It's a terrible film because of the Hollywood budget this thing had thrown at it, and because of the fans' expectations that the Batman series continues to dash.We have Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze/Dr. Victor Fries, who starts off as the lead villain. In the beginning, we find him stealing diamonds to power his giant freeze cannon, with which he plans to zap all of Earth, so he can continue work on trying to cure his diseased, cryogenically-frozen wife undeterred. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy/Pamela Isley comes in a bit later, transforming into the creepy plant-fetish villainess after a row with her scientist boss, who's trying to sell genetically modified super-soldier Bane to warring nations.Alfred's niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) shows up for a visit to the mansion while on vacation from school, and doesn't become Batgirl (Comissioner Gordon's daughter, in every other Batman universe) until about 20 minutes are left in the film, which just strikes me as an excuse for there to be a girl in leather. Well, on second thought, I guess it does sort of make up for the nipples that Bats (George Clooney) and the Boy Wonder (Chris O' Donnell) have built into their body armor. Back to why this is a bad film--the special effects budget seems to have been spent on about five things in this movie: Mr. Freeze's suit and ice gun, Ivy's pheromone dust, fluorescent paint, and black lights. I believe the filmmakers' logic went something like this: ""Scene look too natural? Just throw some fluorescent paint on it--the black light's'll catch it.""Seriously. And don't think Ivy has any amazing plant creatures or anything to pull out of her sleeve to fight the Dynamic Duo--the best she can do is to try to make them horny with her pheromone dust, which she uses approximately 32,751 times during the course of the film. And by the way, did I mention she gives poisonous kisses? Dang. I should have.Anyway, eventually Freeze and Ivy team up, try to destroy Batman and Robin's teamwork, and--what? You expected me to give away the ending? Why should I spare you from having to watch this stain on Hollywood's name for the answer (like you couldn't figure it out yourself)?",Batman & Robin

767,kfrank4,"It doesn't deserve to be called ""Batman""...",1,10 May 2013,"Wow. I must have been the stupidest kid. I actually liked this movie! If it deserves the title of a movie. It is the most awful thing you will ever encounter and should not please any audiences unless this audience is small children. First of all, the main villain, ""Mr. Freeze"" only says these stupid one-liner puns about being cold, such as ""Cool party!"". It may not sound terrible, but believe me, when you see this movie you will feel my pain. Also, he is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I also picture terminator fighting bat-nippled Batman. That's right, Batman and Robin's suits HAVE NIPPLES. For more of my ranting, see my checklist:-The acting and plot is just about the worst it can get -The characters are played by good actors with a horrible script (some are good)-BAT-NIPPLES -Mr. Freeze's stupid one-liner puns-Bane's God-awful stupidity (he was the farthest thing from stupid in the comics)-UmaThurman, an Oscar-winner in one of the best films, ""Pulp Fiction"" plays one of the worst characters (if not THE worst character)in the movie-Alfred is terrible (with lines like, ""I'll cancel the pizzas"" in a BATMAN movie -The script makes me want to pukeThe only two good things about this movie that I can think of is:-The actors and actresses are good actors, just with a VERY BAD script-It actually received a PG-13 ratingAlso, Jeremy Jahns on YouTube brought up that ""Batman Begins"" wouldn't have done as well if ""Batman and Robin"" didn't show what NOT to do. So I guess, in a strange sense that I don't like to think about, ""Batman and Robin"" helped ""Batman Begins"".Overall, if you are planning on seeing this movie, don't. It is the most terrible thing I have ever seen. No exaggeration. From its terrible script to its God-awful acting, it reaches number 1 on my least favorite movie list. I would not even recommend this to an insignificant pebble I find in the lake in my backyard, let alone an actual, living, human being (I also would not recommend it to the dead though).

I remember sitting in the packed theater looking around at all the other movie goers. I noticed that I was not the only one trying to avoid looking at the screen, at one point there was 10 or 12 of us looking at each other just shaking our heads as each horrible scene transpired. George Clooney and Arnold seemed half awake as they exchanged some of the worst dialog in movie history. I have one question for Joel Schumacher...At what point in 1995 did you decide that it would be a good idea to make the worst sequels in history (Next to Superman 3 and 4)? And why? Please send me an answer Joel...Please. Wait on second thought I don't care. Now that I have written this I would like to forget this movie ever happened.

771,peru-resh,"Not great, not terrible",5,18 October 2020,"Of course, this movie is a shallow blockbuster wannabe, as many sequels become after film companies become too greedy and think that they can put an expensive director, some S grade movie stars and it will go alright.
I understand why this movie was so hated by many, as it came out just after Tim Burton masterpieces, so everyone expected something of the same quality. However, they only got something only visually similar, but it also has weak characters, random plot and dumb dialogues. So the biggest mistake of this film is obviously the script, so the first ones here to blame should be the writers and producers.
Despite, this film still can be enjoyable, if you view it as it is and not compare with other Batman movies. I really liked it as I was a child, when it first came out, and then saw it for a second time, a few years back. I still find it quite entertaining and enjoyable. Definitely a lot better than most of superheroes movies made nowadays, you can argue, but I think it's true and if it wasn't a Batman movie, but some other random superhero, you would probably agree.",Batman & Robin

Made in the same vein as the classic 60's TV series, this is an enjoyable romp which doesn't take itself too seriously. You can tell the cast had a blast making this movie.Pay no attention to the naysayers - this movie is a lot of fun. George Clooney makes a terrific Batman, Uma Thurman is to die for and Governor Arnie hams it up as Mr Freeze. All 3 were very well chosen.There were of course downsides. Alicia Silverstone.

Alicia silverstone is pointless, she does nothing in the entire movie except at the end. where that doesn't really come together at all. bane is a wasted character, all he does his grunt and fight the entire movie while Urma Thurman steals the scenes. George Clooney acts to happy to be batman, for someone who is supposed to be tormented superhero. Chris O'Donnell acts the most realistic out of all of them. now the plots are even worse. believe it or not Batman the dark hero is attending fundraisers. there is no telling ever in the movie why poison Ivy goes to Gotham, and why she wants to befriend Freeze. Gotham has no realism any more, towering statues are everywhere. they look bigger than the statue of liberty and there everywhere. Mr. freeze's rocket makes the least sense. in the beginning of the movie he takes off in a rocket just to jump out. the only thing that actually makes sense is that Alfred gets sick. everything else is just a bunch of cheesy plots and lines while the actors do nothing to support their roles.",Batman & Robin

I'm sure if he ever saw this travesty he would die of shock though. Don't get me started on the whole ice hockey with a diamond scene. That was very stupid.

Yes I said freeze the city of Gotham. I don't think it deserves that name now considering it is now decked out in bright neon colours. The introduction of bat girl is done in a rushed way too and i don't believe she brings much to the movie apart from being pretty.The film in short is a kid's movie, the kids will love it but if you are a batman fan like myself you will hate it.

Let's go through the movie together, and list the good and the bad.The good: ""I'm afraid you'll have to die."" That was just... funny. A lot of it is just funny, but not funny enough to justify sitting through the thing. Umm, yeah... that's about it.The bad: Butt shots. Robin's suit looks too much like Batman. He's supposed to be the opposite of Batman, which is why he was so brightly colored. ""Try and bring this one back in one piece"" wtf? How many has he destroyed? It's not like they can just make another one just like that. Bat-shaped paraphernalia all over the place. Having a bat emblem over that little screen thing just doesn't make sense. It's kind of like what they parodied in Spaceballs with ""Spaceballs the toilet paper"" or ""Spaceballs the flamethrower"". Not every tool needs a bat-emblem on it. The police are right out of an Austin Powers movie. Robin made a Robin-signal shaped hole in the wall when he blew through. Yeah right. The hockey team from hell. Yes, both Robin's remark and the ""team"" itself. The ice skates. Stupid idea, but also, they would've had to have been in their feet. The ice age didn't kill the dinosaurs. The soundtrack is right out of an Austin Powers movie too. So is that rocket. All it needs is two ball-shaped fuel tanks. Those surfs wouldn't give enough wind resistance to slow one to a safe velocity in a fall. Why would Freeze send the rocket back to Gotham and destroy it? Just because he's... EVIL!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!! The water glowing red when Batman heats it up. Because contrary to popular belief, water really does glow when heated. Uma's acting sucks, especially as Pamela Eisley. Horribly. I would never have guessed Bane was a Batman villain outside of this movie, let alone intelligent. He was just a big lug in this. Batman's reaction to Robin accidentally getting himself frozen. Alfred not telling Bruce he's dying. Alfred's not that stupid, and he most certainly trusts him enough. Nah, Uma's acting sucks as Ivy too. Her lines really suck. Everyone's lines really suck. Random black girl in Freeze's secret volcano lair. Really, what's the point of some random girl saying how hot she is between the legs for Freeze? Half hour into it and still no good lines. One or two funny lines (even though they were supposed to be taken seriously), but no good lines. ""I don't suppose they have fax machines on elephants... tee hee"" Blonde Batgirl. Why would a reporter ask Bruce about his relationship in front of millions of people? They're introducing a telescope, not gossiping over a $3.50 breakfast at Denny's. Everything else.

Trampling the original concept upon which its movie is based to turn a quick buck.  It's an example of an incredibly over-hyped director being given another chance to direct a movie featuring one of the strongest comic book licenses in existence and failing on every conceivable level.  In fact, Schumacher fails on some levels that no rational moviegoer could have dreamed of.  How can Mr. Freeze, one of Batman's most intelligent and menacing villains be represented as some sort of pun-slinging imbecile?  How could the three main heroes be so petty and shallow?  How can the batmobile, indisputably one of the coolest hero cars ever, be made to look like a shoddy piece of Day-Glo plastic?  And it's not just the batmobile, everything in this movie has the same sort of glow in the dark, cheesy look that you could expect if this film were being directed by a group of Swatch-wearing pre-teen girls at a slumber party.  The only difference is that they may have been able to come up with some better dialogue for our hapless actors to speak.  Everything about this movie screams of being designed to make a quick buck solely based on the success of the previous movies.  Movies that have been getting worse and worse by leaps and bounds as they move away from any pretense of being true to the actual story and concepts behind the comics that inspired them.

793,Shteev,The final nail in the coffin of the brainless blockbuster,1,12 June 1999,"There's a strange attitude amongst movie-goers which Hollywood seems to thrive upon. As soon as the budget of a movie goes above a certain limit, a switch turns over in the brain of the audience, and they start saying 'Well, I know it'll be crap, but it'll be a laugh, and at least they'll be some good special effects'. Batman and Robin was, and will ever be, the last film I will ever say that about.  Yes, it is so bad it has actually changed my whole philosophy on going to the cinema. From now on, I will class myself as a movie-watcher.From the moment Commissioner Gordon informs Batman that 'a new villain is on the loose!', you know you're in for a ride of breathtaking predictability. The word 'camp' is, quite simply, not applicable. Jim Carrey was camp as The Riddler. Uma Thurman just hams. And Schwarzenegger's performance is well below his usual standard. Yes, I do realize what I've just said. He has NEVER been this bad. Completing the unholy triumvirate is George Clooney, who was smooth, but so flat you could confuse him with Mr. Freeze's ice rink. When turning down Thurman's plan for world plant domination, I actually found myself siding with her. And she wasn't even wearing that green outfit then. I have no problem with Alicia Silverstone's or Chris O'Donnell's unremarkable performances... if only the stars of the movie were as good as that.Schumacher is quite capable or producing excellent films, but unfortunately this genre is probably the least suited to his talents. In order for action scenes to work, it is vital that the viewer is able to retain some sence of the geography of the scene. Realism can go hang, we'll gladly give that up for excitement (Gotham Cathedral in 'Batman' was about 15 miles high, as I recall), but an inability to perceive how close our heroes are to danger, or how dangerous it is, by anything other than the background music, is not going to put you on the edge of your seat. 'Oh no! They're being blasted into space! They'll be dead in... er.. some random amount of time... and it doesn't seem to bother them too much anyway'. 'Oh no! Now they're falling to the ground! Oh, but apparently that isn't terminal in Gotham City'. 'Oh no! Robin's been frozen! Ah, who cares'.When I die, and St. Peter asks me what my greatest regrets are, one of them will undoubtably be not having walked out of this film.",Batman & Robin
794,Gnizhak,Uhh.. oh.. well..,2,12 July 1999,"The fourth Batman movie scored the lowest of batmans ever. The best being of course ""Batman - The movie"" and the second was propably the hilarious Batman movie made sometime in the 60's which starred Adam West and Burt Ward.. need I say more ;)The only thing that held the whole ""k3wL F/X"" movie was George Clooney, who was _the_ charismatic Bruce Wayne, and seemed to fit the batman suit a bit better than Val Kilmer. The rest were.. well.. not so good.. Horrible from Arnold (I've still not accepted him to any other roles than Conan or T800/101) Uma Thurman made a terrible Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone was lost like an Eskimo in Arizona.So the Plot was horrible, and the acting looked like acting. No awesome battle scenes, no real neat effects. Just a Batman made for kids, who are too young to watch this sort of movies. I was disappointed for every cent I'd spent on the movie.. I'm was just glad it was over.. phew. We need realistic villains (like Jack Napier), and no boy wonders, or comedy elements (Like Adam West stopping at a high speed chase to let an elderly woman cross the road). Or just something like the cartoons.. dark stormy and painful (although as naive as all the earlier mentioned).",Batman & Robin

It was obviously made with the sole purpose of including Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Batman series as it seemingly had no other point. The story was weak and boring, and the actors themselves showed as much emotion as if they had actually been frozen my Mr. Freeze.  After this disappointing move I hope the Batman series is put to an end... unless of course Tim Burton comes back and directs.

Joel Schumacher indeed took Batman back to the 1960s, and for that sin, he was forever punished. While it upset fans of the first two (of which I am one), when viewed on its own terms, it works.

I thought this was a slap in the face to the Batman franchise. It was just as campy as the 1960 TV series. I didn't like the idea of Batman being too calm, Robin was acting like a spoiled brat, The Batgirl origin was a complete mess, and worst of all, Bane was a muscle bound buffoon when in the comics he's very intelligent. C'mon Schumacher, don't you read the comics? This movie is nowhere near that. The thing that really made me ANGRY was the close ups of Batman and Robin's buttocks, crotch and chest. Don't get me started on the nipples on the chest. WHAT THE FREAKIN HECK IS THAT!!! Everyone do yourselves a favor, buy or rent the 1989 Batman film(which was great) and just pretend there are no sequels to it and stay away from this mess.

This without a doubt ruins what is an amazing superhero and a chance to see his new sidekick in the film,but it was completely ruined.After Batman forever it was no wander i think they wanted a new Batman because Val Kilmer didn't do a very good job at being him,but George Clooney did an even worse job at playing Batman.Also the style of Batman was terrible. When you think of Batman you think of Scary,dark and action/adventure type thing like Tim Burton and Christerphoer Nolan did. But Joel Schumacher did nothing like that in fact i think he did the complete opposite of that.Arnold Schrawzaneger as Mr Freeze was absolutely terrible to.He didn't do what i expect Arnold to do in his other films,(e.g. in The Terminator trilogy or in other great action films he is in.)

Joel Schumacher has put the final nail in the coffin of a once proud franchise.  All the good that Tim Burton did with ""Batman"" (1989) is undone by this movie's terrible screen-writing, heavy-handed and amateurish directing.

I mean come on, this film had no plot, the story was idiotic and what was going on with the one liners: ""chicks like you give women a bad name."" Watching Batman and Robin was extremely painful it was like watching a chick-flick with a load of flashing lights on the screen. Micheal Keaton and Christian Bale made a good performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman, especially vocally when they were playing batman, Val Kilmer was interesting to watch but with Clooney playing the bat a) you could recognise him DUH!! b) he's voice completely remained the same. The villains..oh my good lord it was like sitting through a pantomime the jokes wasn't even funny it was just embarrassing to watch and speaking of embarrassment The guy who played Commissioner Gordon made a total D*ck of of himself in the scene where he is handing over the keys to poison ivy to get access to the bat-signal.

I prefer it over Christian Bale's version.I have seen the reviews of both good and bad and a lot of people are ripping on all the puns this movie has. What they fail to realize is: DC Comics were based on puns to begin with. The original Batman series was full of them too so I say that is a dead argument. Now the script on other hand, well you work with what you have. Could it have been better? Probably. Are there a lot of character inconsistencies of Comic Book Counterparts? Definitely. Take Bane for example, he is nothing like his Comic Book counterpart. But I guess producers decided to make him a brute, otherwise you would have 3 intelligent people against one, two if you count Alfred, I do not count as Robin as he is still a ""boy"" in this equation.Regardless of all the flaws that this movie has.

This movie is a cheesey piece of crap, which is a failed attempt at mimicking the fun, cheesiness of the 1960's show (hey, although I do wish more people would take Batman, and comic books in general, more seriously, I have to admit, the classic Batman T.V. series was entertaining in its own special way - unlike this horrid film).

809,Sheelal,one of the worst superhero movies ever made,4,26 April 2008,"I first saw this in 1998 shortly before my seventh birthday; I was really attracted to this movie. Now that I'm older I really have to state my thoughts on this movie.The Truth: I think kids are more likely going to be into this movie, because I think Warner Brothers wanted Batman to be more family-friendly. With Batman Returns I guess parents were complaining that the movie was too scary for kids and complained to WB about it and they got Batman Forever which came out in 1995. I think Joel Schumacher went too far being kid-friendly, plus this movie was mostly designed to sell toys.Positive comments: I think this is a great family movie and a great kid's movie (despite the PG-13 rating) or if you like watching crappy movies. The scenes with Michael Gough are the good parts in the movie. Plus Freeze's origins are no different from the comic book.Negative comments: The storyline stayed untrue to the comic book series, it's almost like a seven year-old kid wrote it. Batman portrayed as some happy-go lucky superhero who now has a grin on his face. The acting really sucks and it's not the actor's fault it was the script. The direction of this movie makes no sense, such as the ice-hokey scene, or the bat suit having nipples and the neon batmobile. The dialogue sucks. such as ice-puns! The characters are very different from their comic counterparts such as Bane and Batgirl. I was really angry about how the filmmakers chose to cast Bane as dumb henchman. Pointless scenes such as the motorcycle race (Green fire?!?!?) and the part sexist auction.Conclusion: If you want to watch a great superhero movie look no further into this. I think this was a cross between Batman Forever and 1960's TV show. If you want watch a good superhero movie watch The Dark Knight, Batman Begins instead or Batman and Batman Returns. 1/10 stars",Batman & Robin
810,Godfather-1990,The Worst comic book movie ever,1,19 December 2012,"It's been awhile since the last time I gave 1/10 to a movie, but this one totally deserved it. It was one of the most dreadful and painful movie experiences I've ever had, and the first one to blame is obviously the infamous Joel Schumacher who proved that it is possible to turn some of the most iconic comic book characters into some of the most ridiculous clowns, and instead of taking care of his characters and story, he decided to fill his movie with action sequences that never seemed to end, presenting some awful special effects despite the massive budget of the movie.Of course there are others to blame, like the guys who wrote the dialogue that made me want to smack the actors every time one of them delivers one of those horrifying lines starting with ""I'll cancel the pizzas"", in addition to the characters who were ridiculed like turning bane into nothing more than a big dumb pile of muscles, and some lame subplots like Alfred's illness and the envy between Batman and Robin that were totally out of place and seemed to exist only to prolong the movie and to make the characters even more annoying.All the actors did a bad job including some talented ones who I'm sure wish to go back in time and steer away from this thing.So, I can safely say that this is the worst comic book movie ever, the one that gave Batman a terrible reputation ,, thank god for giving us Christopher Nolan who brought The Dark knight back to life.",Batman & Robin

I appreciate it more and more every time I see it. Not only does Joel Shumacher bring the Batman franchise into a whole new light, but he chose a dynamite cast. It's funny, family-friendly, and has some wicked action sequences. I can't see why anyone would dislike ""Batman and Robin"", because 'holy nipple-suits, Batman! This movie rocks!' If you haven't seen it yet, rent it- or better yet, buy it! The story is awesome and the acting is incredible. The costumes, music, and lighting are exceptional.

814,save_us_yh,It's Not THAT Bad...,5,13 July 2012,"Out of all the Batman movies, this one always gets the worst reaction but I think this is coming from hardcore fans; unwilling to acknowledge the lighter side of Batman, that he, indeed, had, once upon a time! Really, watching this film, without any knowledge of the characters or just with the mind of a child...it's not so bad. It's just overly cheesy...I recently watched this movie with my four year old godson, who is very informed about the characters of the Batman universe (thanks to me!), so he knows about the gritty, ""SWEAR TO ME!"", Batman and the wacky, one liner, Adam West Batman. The result? He LOVES this movie. Not once did he complain about the jokes or the one liners. He was afraid of the ""scary"" moments and the look of Bane (it's his favorite character as a whole) and it's then that I began to realize something: This movie isn't about the gritty Batman; it wasn't made for the hardcore fans---no! It was made for children! And in that regard, it's a great family film. I take the feel of the movie to be the 60's version, but updated. What would have been if Adam West and Burt Ward had the 90's technology. And let's not forget: Back then, these Batman movies were marketed to kids and even could be seen as ""children's movies""; whereas, today, with the Christopher Nolan series, Batman is seen more adult; with more adult themes and whatnot. With that said, let's tackle the acting aspect of the movie; maybe one of two things that are actually bad about the movie. Yes, sorry Batman, but the acting here is really bad; even horrible at times. Clooney, in my opinion, is the worst Batman of all time. His Bruce Wayne is more on the better side, at least, but let's face it: George Clooney IS Bruce Wayne...so not much of a stretch. People cited that his horrible take on Batman is because he talks too much, but keep in mind, again, that this movie is more of a homage to the 60's series, where Batman couldn't shut up...so I can understand the talking; HOWEVER, it's all about the delivery of speech and Clooney just sounds wooden; not at all like he is having fun. The opposite of this, is Arnold as Mr. Freeze! Oh man! So many Ice puns but, AGAIN, this movie is going for the comedic, 60's series feel, and the villains back then...THAT'S ALL THEY DID! PUN'S A PLENTY! So, yet again, I can forgive that. Hell, I think Arnold is the best part of the movie. Yes, the jokes are horrible (but light hearted fun at least) but at least he is ENJOYING his role and time. You can see how into the movie and role he is playing. He is having a great time and I think that counts as something. Poison Ivy, played by Uma Thurman, is another example of this. Yes, she is over-acting to the bone but that's what these villains are supposed to be: OVER THE TOP! In that regard, the performance validates the role. Chris O' Donnell as Robin, on the other hand, is pretty bad, performance wise. He tries his hardest but all his lines are of him whining and complaining. So maybe it's not his fault; as he had nothing really to work with. However, the worst actor award in the movie goes to Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. It's like she didn't even try. She's wooden and there's no feeling. Hell, her character from Clueless had more passion; and that's just plain sad...The effects, sets and colors were all pretty good; interesting to look at; albeit a bit corny but good for it's time. Mr. Freeze's Ice Suit is pretty awesome to look at; and Poison Ivy's various suits and make up are pretty nice as well. The Batman and Robin suits are okay; nothing really special or new at the time. The silver ones (used at the end of the movie) are somewhat better but weren't necessary. They didn't have any special effect, so why switch costumes? Or maybe they did. It's not explained. Actually, I like the Robin suit from Batman Forever. I like how they mixed the Red/Green/Gold, but just made it darker in tone. The ice/freeze beams were great too. Bane looked pretty bad ass too; albeit a little cartoon-like...The character growth or stories vary with success. I like how they did include Nora Fries in the movie; showing how Victor isn't really evil, just a desperate man, wanting to be with his wife again. I liked how they made Ivy and her love of plants and nature a must. There was no real development for Batman and Robin, but I guess they didn't really need a new storyline or anything. Bane was great to see, but they made him a brainless idiot; instead of the master strategist he really is. My biggest gripe with the film, comes again with Alicia Silverstone. Being that she is from England, in the film, you'd think she'd have an accent but nope. None found. Also, Alfred's Niece? UNFORGIVABLE! Which, brings me to Alfred, who is always a treat, thanks to Michael Gough but I found it funny that Alfred made a sexy, tight, spandex suit, complete with breasts and thong for his niece. Odd...All in all, it's certainly not the best Batman flick you'll see but it doesn't have to be the worst either. Watch this with a son, daughter, nephew, niece or with the open mind of a child and you'll enjoy it. I saw the smile on my nephew's face and was delighted just because he was happy and enjoying the picture. ""Bane is awesome huh?"", just shows how much this kid didn't find anything wrong with his character or the tone of the movie. He enjoyed it for what it was and what it gave him!",Batman & Robin

The first two Batman films, directed by Tim Burton, were awesome. Batman Forever was brilliant. But this? Rubbish! The film had a bad storyline, bad characters and was too light for a Batman movie. Mr Freeze is my least favourite of the Batman villains. He is not a patch on the Joker, the Penguin or even the Riddler. Poison Ivy was alright, but nowhere as near as good as Catwoman from Batman Returns. George Clooney is the worst actor to play Batman. Val Kilmer was better than Clooney.

So why the 5? This movie is hilarious. Between the bad acting and obscure references to totally unrelated subjects, it's just so terrible you cannot help but enjoy it. I personally feel that the writers intentionally ignored all of the batman lore to make a point: this isn't a batman movie.If you like laughing at intentionally awful movies then this is something for you.

The first three batman films were very good, I know forever was little weird but wasnt terrible. This movie destroys Mr. Freeze and Bane's characters. Making Freeze not the no personality guy he is with an arnold personality and then makeing bane mindless idiot.. which he is not at all... and they also made him seem like a weakling without his toxin, which he was not. and additon to the destruction of those two characters they also destroy Batman with George Cloooney (Who picked him seriously?) and Batgirl who is no longer Gordan's daughter but Alfred's niece.It was also not very entertaining with the 2nd-rate plot and bad fight scenes.But, again with the bad actor choice: I do not blame the actors for this, which alot of people are, most of them are not good picks for this role, but if you were offered money to act in a role that didnt fit you, would you do it? Yes.",Batman & Robin
823,Gaff82,Pure Garbage,1,17 May 2005,"""Clooney did good as both Bruce and Batman?"" ""I'd rank this as #2 of the 4?"" ""if you're a Batman fan, you'll find a lot to like?"" Uh, no, sorry, that's just bulls**t on a stick! Clooney was not a good Batman, he was a good George Clooney in a bat-suit, there's a difference! This movie has been called a retread of ""Forever,"" but it's not even that! It's a retread of the Adam West Batman, injected with so much color and CGI, your eyes will bleed, and not in a good way either! And as for that ""if you're a fan"" comment, just what kind of people did you think started the ""'I hate this movie' bandwagon,"" huh?! BATMAN FANS, STUPID!!! B&R was the furthest thing from the spirit of the Batman as any sane human being could ever imagine! The neon lights on the car, the bat-credit cards, the nipples on the suit, Arnold's corny cold lines, Robin's whiny attitude, clueless Silverstone, retarded Bane, and can someone explain to me why Freeze would keep a hooker around? He's got his wife in a tube waiting for some cure, she's the whole reason he's doing all this stuff, and he's got a hooker around not doing anything for him? Nearly everything about this movie is crap, and a giant insult to the legend of Batman. Yes, the subplot with Alfred's illness was reasonably okay, but it's not enough to redeem an entire movie. All three of the first ones were better than this, even Returns! Schumacher didn't know Batman, and apparently, neither do you! You claim to own 3000 Batman comics and you don't know this?! Read Alex Ross' ""Batman: War on Crime,"" or go watch any trailers of Batman Begins, and learn something about Batman!",Batman & Robin
824,mcg26,One of my favorite movies!! Not bad at all.,10,5 July 2012,"This movie is not at all bad. The criticisms are from people who take things so darn serious. The actors were all perfect for their roles, especially Arnold. He is the perfect actor to play Mr. Freeze. He has the perfect accent and it suits him perfectly. People say Mr. Freeze isn't supposed to have emotion and they give Batman the Animated Series as an example. If you're going to cite something, make sure it's accurate please. Mr. Freeze in that show was full of emotion like the character is supposed to. His wife is dying for crying out loud. He does everything he does to save her and I'm pretty sure that's freaking emotional. This movie along with Batman Forever are not meant to be taken seriously. It was obviously made to be funny and not serious. I dislike all the nerds and geeks saying because it's not dark, it's bad, or the lines are stupid. Grow up and listen to Heath in the Dark Knight. ""Why So Serious?"" The only negatives I have for this movie is that they made Bane a henchman instead of a calculating mastermind and that Batgirl isn't Gordon's daughter. Other than that, great movie.",Batman & Robin
825,JediJackSparrow,From bad to worse in 2 hours...,1,21 March 2004,"Batman & Robin (1997) - 1/10 Horrible summer action flick that's driven the last nail in the coffin of the dying Batman movie franchise that managed to go from brilliant to trash in 4 installments. Miscast trash that pits our strapping heroes Batman and Robin, joined by the abhorrently acted Batgirl, against your stereotypical Arnold character (Mr. Freeze) and an extremely hammy villain in Poison Ivy. George Clooney gives the worst rendition of the caped crusader yet, playing, as he always does, himself. Chris O'Donnell can't act, so that immediately signals the fact that Robin will be rather ineptly portrayed. I don't even feel the need to waste energy typing out how badly acted Batgirl was in this travesty.Arnold, as mentioned before, plays the same character he always does - complete with cheesy one-liners abound in the film. You know the writing is absolutely terrible when Mr. Freeze says ""Stay Cool"". At that moment, I felt like I was watching an episode of the 60's television show. Too bad even Adam West beats George Clooney as Batman. Uma Thurman, obviously able to grasp that the movie she's in sucks, hams up her role beyond belief, to the point where you can't bear the cheesiness any further. A cast of idiotic henchmen join our villains (where do they get these armies of inept thugs from anyway?) in several preposterous action sequences.All in all, this poorly written, poorly directed, terribly miscast crapfest manages to take its place as the worst mainstreamed film of 1997. Absolutely cheesy dialogue, terribly adapted characters, and an overall feeling of amateurish filmmaking made me leave the theater before the (predictably terrible) conclusion of the film. You'll be wanting your money back from this one.It's unfortunate that Joel Schumacher took over the Batman franchise now - it seemed to be going placed with Burton at the helm, but with this installment I think it's pretty safe to say the dark knight is blemished in the realm of filmmaking for good. 1/10 - steer clear at all costs.",Batman & Robin
826,historyfreak356,"Why even call this a ""Batman"" movie?",3,16 February 2012,"Rubber nipples, eye shadow, giant Gotham statues, a batman mobile with a glowing see-through engine, cheesy one liners, a bat credit card, auctions for hot women ranging in the thousands, people dancing while wearing gorilla costumes, magic love dust and finally singing along to the ""snow miser song"" from the 1974 movie Year without a Santa Claus .WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH BATMAN??? Cause this was a Batman movie right? Watching it again after reading dozens of comics and really understanding the characters and I do mean the psychology of all of the characters makes me think otherwise. Joel Schumacher re-did all the characters to appear more kid friendly. And it must have worked because I saw this movie in theaters when I was ten years old. No I didn't spend money on it and now I'm glad I didn't. This was the only Batman film going on at the time. I had a bigger interest in watching Batman the Animated Series than watching this movie again on VHS. This was the worst Batman movie ever created in the history of Batman movies it may be the worst superhero movie of all time! First of all, this film had WAYYY TOO MUCH GOING ON!!! 1. Alfred is dying from a terminal illness 2. Batman and Robin are fighting about their partnership 3. Barbara Gordon (Oh I'm sorry her last name was Pennyworth in this film right because she's not related to the commissioner like in the comic book she's related to Alfred?) is staying at Wayne Manor for who knows how long? 4. Mr. Freeze wants to hold the city for ransom to find a cure for his wife who has the same disease as Alfred. 5. Poison Ivy wants Gotham to be hers ""For the greening"" yes she actually say what I just quoted in the movie. 6. Bane becomes Poison Ivy's henchman who was supposed to be used for world domination.There is not one word I can use to describe this movienot one! Basic plot synopsis: Batman & Robin are working together to stop Mr. Freeze from stealing diamonds. But Batman thinks ahead of everyone of course he's going to have built in ice skates to take down ""the hockey team from hell""? Meanwhile, Alfred is sickthis made me guess right away in theaters that this was going to be the last Batman movie of the franchiseand I'm glad it was! It just couldn't get any worse than this. Not only were there too many characters at once they were casted terrible too. The only ones that returned were Michael Gough as Alfred, Chris O'Donnell as Robin and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon (But he obviously is not as important as I would have hoped because apparently in this film Barbara is Alfred's niece not the commissioner's daughter). Seriously has Joel Schumacher even read a Batman comic in his life? I couldn't believe who he picked to play Batman this timeGEORGE CLOONEY? Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze? Come on! Joel must have decided to blow his casting budget on the cheesy costume and unnecessary make-up budget. After all, Mr. Freeze was covered in blue body paint; they were thugs with neon glowing face paint, Uma Thurman changing her hair dos, costumes and make up every scene, and the different batman/robin/bat girl suits.There were only two things I liked about this movie: The opening credits with that cool soundtrack that sounds very heroic and the Riddler costume in Arkham Asylum an inside joke that shows continuity from the last movie: Batman ForeverThis was the ultimate show stopper; I can't believe Joel Schumacher wanted to do a ""fifth"" one after this movie?!",Batman & Robin
827,adgarasict,Arnold Schwarzenegger's worst movie to date!!!,1,23 March 2012,"Ah Schwarzenegger,silly silly Schwarzenegger. It is only because of him the movie is bearable to watch as the other actors are terrible and don't give a dam about making a good movie. His one lines are indeed the best dialogue out of all the actors in the movie. Indeed Clooney himself thinks its a load of crap by having a permanent smile on his face, despite the fact Alfred is dying in his arms. The opening titles are testament to how homosexual this movie is (e.g. close ups of Batmans and Robins asses,nipples on their armour etc)The set design is awful for a movie costing 125million to make. No wonder it barely broke even. The only thing which could be worse is the 1960s camp Batman. Who at least was funny and not just strange. Hopefully this film will not be back anytime soon",Batman & Robin
828,anu_vijai2000,Might as well give good actors crap roles!!!!!,2,8 July 2013,"First of all this is my first review and it might not be so professional, so yeah. OK Batman & Robin, it's got the worst metascore out of all the movies I've seen on IMDb. As a kid I liked this movie but as I kept watching it, everything felt wrong to me. The whole idea of the movie could've been a lot better.The first person I hav to blame for the crapiness of this film is Schumacher. That guy doesn't even know how to direct a movie. Number 2 is George Clooney, he doesn't even look like Batman or Bruce Wayne. Number 3 is Chris O'Donnell, this guy doesn't even look like Robin, Robin is supposed to be a semi- teenager not some 30 year old weirdo.OK let's talk about the story line, the movie is the sequel of Batman Forever (you wouldn't believe if I said it was the finale of Batman and Batman Returns). It starts of with Gotham Muesem being attacked by Mr Freeze and Batman and Robin go to rescue the museum from Freeze. Batman's one liners are **** in this scene. Mr Freeze's lines are funny, but they are unsuitable for his character. And so the story travels on with no story at all as usual you hav a climax fight and Batman wins the day. The story is mainly based on Mr Freeze trying to save his wife from death. Anyway even the story line was to confusing to understand. One minit Freeze is trying to protect his wife next minit she's dead and he tries to freeze Gotham for it. Anyway the movie is rubbish.Let's get some good pointers put of this ( which is literally impossible ). The only reason why I'm a giving it a 2 is because it's Batman. And something else that would save it from a rating of 1 was that it was actually a pretty good recreation of the original Adam West TV series which I actually liked and found funny. If that's what Schmacher wanted to do he actually succeeded in that aspect, but otherwise. ****!Rounding it up it was a crap movie and something u might not hav noticed was that this movie was actually closing that chapter for the Tim Burton original Batman anthology. Compare this and the Dark Knight rises. BIG DIFFERENCE!!! This movie had no aspects of a finale. Anyway that's it from me. If u like the movie u like it if u hate it u hate it.",Batman & Robin
829,Sebastian_Halm,Holy disaster!,3,22 December 2006,"It's easy to excoriate this movie, because it doesn't deserve better. Acting, directing, dialog and plot are ridiculous - well, that has been said before. The truly sad thing about Batman and Robin is that it has been such a massive setback for fans all over the world and - what's even worse - for the dark knight himself who has become a neon knight dressed in plastic, driving a plastic car, delivering plastic lines and fighting against non-threatening villains. That's the most important point: The movie doesn't need another destructive criticism - its best purpose is to serve as a foil for the latest movie, the excellent ""Batman Begins"" which has at least two things that ""Batman and Robin"" lacks: the commitment of its makers and much love for the characters and the legend. There should be a warning to young Batman Fans to stay away from watching it. Thank Christopher Nolan we have ""Batman Begins"" and can now, after years in which the last impression we had of our hero was a terrible one, start what is the best way to deal with ""Batman and Robin"" : Forget it has ever been made.",Batman & Robin
830,Karen0662-1,I like this movie!!!,8,17 February 2007,"I for one, really like this particular Batman version! Way to go Joel Schumacher! I love Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze is cool too! lol I like this portrayal of the Batman series much more than the dark brooding series downer garbage. And although I like Tim Burton and some of his work, his version of Batman was my least favorite and the most distasteful to watch in my opinion. This one on the other hand, is lot's of fun and visually entertaining. Uma's great and gorgeous as usual. I personally like Joel Shumacher's work on this and many other movies including Phantom! This Batman and the one with Jim Carrey as well as the original with Jack Nicholson are my favorites of the series. All around good fun!!! Clooney may not be my favorite Batman, but hey.",Batman & Robin
831,leilaosman-osman2,Oh Dear!,3,1 July 2014,"OK how do i begin? This film is unbelievably awful. It is so awful that it's simply amazing... The script for one is...don't get me started. The acting *Wretch,wretch* Is let's just say...F***ing awful. The CGI... The props.... Don't even get me started on costume design or the cinematography for that matter. Everything is terrible but somewhat awesome. Like how it is so ridicules it is amazing. Definitely watch it if you are a fan of Batman just for fun. It's fun,entertaining and enjoyable (at parts unwatchable) but as a critic just simply no. Over all 2/10 But the film earns extra points for BATNIPPLES! so a total score of 3/10 ""Do you know what killed the dinosaurs the ice age."" *Hand face*",Batman & Robin
832,jacktorrance123,Greatest movie of all time,10,7 June 2013,"I can't believe that people say that this is the worst movie of all time. This movie is excellent but not perfect. I know part of it is messy but it is overall, ultra entertaining. With great costumes and special effects, it is undoubtedly the greatest movie of all time.And great performances, from Arnold, George, Chris, Uma, and that person. How can people say this is overrated? seriously? It is the quintessential movie. A must see. Another thing that irks me is that it is not on IMDb's top 250. And it should be number 1 in sight and sound directors poll! Highway robbery! It is the perfect super hero movie. This movie is greater than redemption, the dark knight, pulp fiction, the godfather. the only movie that ranks up with this is batman forever! Catwoman is the 3rd best movie1 I love this movie! Arnold for president!",Batman & Robin
833,s00015286,Why Did They Change Batman's Tone?,1,4 May 2013,"I was confused at first when I saw the sudden changes of Batman's tone beginning with Batman Forever through Batman & Robin. Until today, I have learned that some folks weren't satisfied with the dark and violent atmosphere of Batman Returns. So, in order to make the franchise appealing to children, WB sought Joel Schumacher to butcher our beloved hero. Ironically, although Joel managed to soften his Batman version, I wondered, ""Why didn't WB and the PTA complain about the Bat suit design?"" You have seen how the director showed you closeups of the dynamic duo's nipples, crouches, buttock, and let's not forget the homo parts. Seriously?!!! They weren't satisfied with the violence, yet they are cool with eroticism?!!! Sweet Lord! This is like 'The Itchie & Scratchie & Marge' situation when you're cool with little children watching Michealangelo's David. If their children aren't gonna grow up to be violent, then in that case they may grow up to be pervs. If you were a true Batman fan, then pray with me that WB wouldn't ruin a future Batman, since they're rebooting the series after 'The Dark Knight Rises.'",Batman & Robin
834,bradenewee,One of the worst films of all time.,1,5 June 2013,"Clichés and puns. Two things that movie makers should never go to. But this film has it all. Every ice pun and stupid clichés the film uses make me cringe. But that's not that worst part. The worst part is so horrifying that it may ruin your love of Batman. The Bat credit card. Words cannot express how awful it is. I still get shudders from it. The acting is simply awful. Never before have I seen actors not care at all. The plot also sucks. It's predictable and lazy.What's strange is that after watching the film, I felt sorry for the Africans. All the money wasted on this awful film. It could've gone to them.",Batman & Robin
835,Muldoon-colin,The 90's Couldn't Appreciate This Movie,8,25 August 2018,This movie was always good. Everyone in the 90's was just too edgey to see how fun this was!,Batman & Robin
836,hansonevan14,This is the worst movie I have ever saw in my entire life.,1,3 September 2013,"This movie sucks. The casting sucks, the acting sucks, the action sucks, the effect sucks, everything about this movie is a mess. I spend one Thanksgiving night watch this shitty movie. I hate this movie so much. The first line of this movie is that Robin said ""I want a car, chicks dig to car"" and then Batman said ""this is why Superman works alone"". It gets worse and worse by the minute.Batman is play by George Clooney, which makes Val Kilmer's batman look like Michael Keaton's batman. Look I like George Clooney he's a good actor, but was he good in this, not at all. He doesn't have the right Batman voice, he just crashed through the window and was like ""hi freeze I'm Batman"". Really, is that the best you could do. Overall, George Clooney is a terrible Batman.Robin is play by Chris O' Donnell. All he does in this entire movie is just complain about stupid stuff. And that's all I have to say about his performance in this movie.Mr.Freeze is play by Arnold Schwarzenegger. One of the worst casting decisions ever. He only said one liners in this movie that consists of puns. And that pun is ice. ""Allow me to break the ice"", ""Okay everyone, chill"" ""Hell, freeze is over"", ""Let's kick some ice"", ""What kill the dinosaurs, the ice age"".Poison Ivy is play by Uma Thurman. She was actually nominated for an Oscar before this movie came out. Terrible performance from her in this movie, worst Poison Ivy.Batgirl is play by Alicia Silverstone. Worst performance in this movie. That's all I have to say.In the end, never see this movie, ever. This is the worst movie I have ever saw in my entire life. I'll never see it again. Oh yeah, who could ever forget the Bat-Nipples and Bat-Asses. Who's idea was that in the first place to put those things in? I hate this movie so much, makes me cringe every time I think about it. This movie is so horrible!",Batman & Robin
837,chrjonaris,Too painful to watch...,1,27 April 2014,"One night while i was watching TV, I started flipping through the channels when i happened to find this abomination on the hub. I had heard rumors about it, and decided to watch it out of curiosity. Well, instead of being hilariously bad like i'd thought, it turned out to be so bad it was unbearable. Seriously, Mr. Freeze's ice puns made my head throb and the dialogue was just awful. I really wonder what the people who made this were thinking. Robin is also a whining p*ssy in this (hasn't he always been in the Batman Animated Series?). Also why did they have to zoom in on their @***s and nipples when they were putting on the costumes? Awkward. Plus, their are parts of this film that are just sexist. Like when Batman and Robin started betting on which women they found most attractive(Batman using a bat credit card?). Considering how creative the batman movies were before this piece of crap came out, this just feels more like a pathetic franchise to make money rather than a movie. Please, don't waste your time or money...",Batman & Robin
838,DrunkenrenoBoya,Not as bad as you might think!,7,27 June 2005,"This movie is like a modern version of the original TV-series! It doesn't take itself seriously, and the actors seems to have a lot of fun while doing their overacting. It's pretty fun, and has great effects (for its time). The moronic use of a great character (Bain - just read Knightfall to see what I mean), and the decision to include Silverstone, are two sore points though. Anyway, if you don't care about continuity, and if you are willing to see the movie for what it is - a modern take of the 50:s-60:s version of Batman, then it's not that bad. I haven't seen Batman Begins yet, but I'm looking forward to it. After a series of over the top Batman movies, it's time to get down to earth. a grittier, more serious batman. I believe it's going to be great, probably the best of the Batman movies. But this movie isn't that horrible, just different. A nice rental. Best served with lots of beer and some popcorn.",Batman & Robin
839,yahwehisagape,Wasn't Batman Forever enough???,2,13 May 2014,"Before I start I'm just going to inform you that I'm about to review one of the WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! So if you are one of those people that despise badly done, over the top, most used clichés in a movie ever... I highly suggest you to leave. If you don't, good luck! The plot is basically a cliché. Its about Batman and Robin starting to become an unstable team and their trying to keep their relationship stable while trying to stop Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy from you guessed it, trying to take over the world. Anther story is that when Alfreds niece comes for a visit she finds out that Bruce and Dick (Ha, Ha Dick.) are Batman and Robin she joins them as the vicious Batgirl. But wait there's more! Alfred gets sick and apparently has the EXACT SAME DISEASE AS MR. FREZZES WIFE!!! So yea that's a lot of story lines. I don't really have to explain the characters its freaking Batman!So this movie was a gigantic flop.

I wouldn't even insult this toilet with this sh!t.The series went downhill when it lost Keaton and Burton, I shall treasure those films as real members of the Batman series!The first two films were based from the comic books. Hence the darker theme of someone trying to find themselves. Also notice the lack of meaningless bad guys, and the lack of Chris O'Donnell. How was Mr. Freeze introduced? Wasn't it something like, ""we've got a new villain!"" Where is the character development in that?Pathetic.",Batman & Robin
842,joshuapetry,Could have been better........,1,22 May 2005,"Batman and Robin's storyline was boring and full of drudgeries. This movie could have been better. (Freeze and Ivy are great characters.) First off, why did Arnold (don't even make me spell it) play Mr. Freeze? The only reason I can come up with is Freeze is a German last name. I also find it hard to believe that Mr. Freeze can be in tears over his wife and, when interrupted, kills a man on site. Mr. Freeze was not portrayed as a doctor, but as a man who was trying to save him wife by physical prowess. Secondly, Poison Ivy was PATHETIC. Uma Thurman could have done a fantastic job. Poison Ivy is a Murderous Mistress not a Pretty-in-Pink Drama Queen that just happens to have a mean side. Her powers were also pathetic. The story needed to be thicker in her case. All I can say was good about poison Ivy is that she was beautiful and somewhat seducing. Finally Graphics and Stunts were awful. Pay attention to the cities freezing scene. Some of the ice looks rubber. I find it hard to believe that Batman can be thrown through a window by a single punch. Poorly done. Badly acted. For this movie, the bat has left the cave.",Batman & Robin
843,mattdowning-1,Like watching a train wreck!,1,3 March 2007,"This movie is, without a doubt, the WORST movie I've ever seen! House of 1000 corpses, Gigli, and Battlefield Earth have nothing on Batman and Robin! I remember being somewhat intrigued by the thought of George Clooney as Batman, and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. While Clooney is a bit old for the role, worse casting decisions have been made in the film industry. I was sure Uma Thurman, meanwhile, would bring the needed sexiness and sultriness to the character of Poison Ivy. I was so wrong on both counts that I am almost ashamed to write this review. George Clooney played himself in a bat costume....and I might add that he did a poor job of playing even HIMSELF! Uma Thurman was just....silly as Poison Ivy. There's really no other way to describe it. And Arnold....the less said about him as Mr. Freeze, the better. Having said all that, I recommend this to anyone who loves watching horrible movies; every time I see this movie on TV, I literally cannot pull myself away. More than that, I call family a friends to tell them it's on, so they can join in the (unintentional, it must be strongly noted) hilarity! The pure camp value of Mr. Freeze's awful one-liners, and Thurman's unbelievably cheesy performance is just so over the top, you almost can't believe this wasn't an intentional attempt by director Joel Schumacher to utterly and completely destroy the Batman Franchise.

Why do movies seem to go downhill with each sequel rather than improve? I mean, one would think that a sequel is opportunity for improvement not deprovement. the bat-gizmo's were bad enough to ruin it without such classically stupid mutterings such as, ""Curses!"", and ""stay cool, bird boy."" Not to mention whats up with the nipples???? The costumes have nipples on them, not to mention butt-molds. Bat-ice-skates?? Bat-heat-rays??

846,colestafford,My thoughts on batman and robin,6,3 September 2017,Spoiler warning I always have a place in my heart for this movie because I use to watch this as a kid. Speaking of that this movie has lots lots of things wrong with it. First George Clooney was okay as Bruce Wayne but as batman he was awful. Next robin in this film just cried and wined in this movie. Next Alicia silveraton bat girl dumb. Arnold Schwarzenegger and uma Thurman are over the top. The plot is also just basic. But the things that I enjoyed as a kid and still do today is that it is fun movie to watch and nice looking movie to. I think what a lot of people may not get is this movie is a lot like the Adam west show. So all of that being said this is probably the worst batman movie but I still sit down and enjoy this movie because I use to watch this a kid. But don't watch this movie thinking it is a dark knight movie because it isn't it is more like the Adam west show. I give batman and robin 6/10.,Batman & Robin

The cliche villain dialogue, lack of character development between Batman and Robin, the tilted camera angles. Sound familiar? It sounds like a Batman episode from 1967. Batman & Robin is a sequel to Batman in 1989, which is clearly a darker setting and tone than the television series set in the 60s. But, WB studios wanted to market Batman better with toys and appeal to a younger audience. Enter Batman Forever... flashy, campy, more action, less character development. Batman & Robin is a direct result of the market scene that WB tried and ultimately failed. Thankfully, we had the animated series to keep Batman the entire franchise from extinction. In essence, Batman & Robin does work as a movie if Adam West and Burt Ward were the respected duo. It wouldn't be a masterpiece, but more widely accented. Unfortunately, this Batman & Robin movie was 30 years too late for the party and we a got a movie we didnt want.",Batman & Robin
852,billmeadows,Makes you want to kick Joel Schumachers ice...,10,7 August 2007,"Batman has long been seen as one of the greatest heroes of all time- Gothic, mysterious, cool, clever- then why, Joel, did you take that image and ruin it? Joel has never been one of my favourite directors, but even I did not believe he could sink so low. Joel Schumacher has taken the batman franchise and transformed it into a live action cartoon- Over the top performances, silly superpowers, and worst of all, the worst puns in history.With these bad points, you may be wandering why I awarded the film 3 rather than 1 out of 10. This is because it does have a few good points- namely, some of the best special effects ever(for the time, anyway) and also features some great and authentic costumes and locations.But thats where any good points end. The rest of the film, for the over-10 year old's watching it, is simply a humiliation to sit through. Featuring some of the most over the top, hammed up performances ever, none of the villains fail to convince the audience of their evilness. After all, how can a villain terrify when Mr. Freeze says 'Chill!' and 'Cool party!'? The villains cause more laughs than anything else in the film, and are the biggest insult to batman fans everywhere.Even the heroes are awful- with the clean cut, smooth ladies man George Clooney playing the dark, haunted Bruce Wayne, Batman himself is ruined by a woefully bad miscasting.So, all in all? If you want a movie to laugh at, then please watch this movie- it is quite simply hilarious in parts ('My condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy'). But, if you came to watch a batman film, and not a pun ridden mess, then avoid this like the plague.",Batman & Robin
853,jussi-23,The only good thing about this movie was on the soundtrack....,1,11 November 2005,"The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack song ""The End Is The Beginning Is The End"", composed by Billy Corgan and performed by the The Smashing Pumpkins. When I saw the music video, I was inclined to see the movie - but the acting was just horrible and the plot was so full of holes. But I still like the video though - for some reason it's not included on the The Smashing Pumpkins 1991-2000 DVD video collection - perhaps due to copyright issues with the Batman-franchise.Arnie wasn't ""bad"" per se, actually the only interesting character in the film, but the plot just spoiled the whole thing for me.

Arnold was great as Mr.Fries and used lots of puns that gave me chills, Uma was a great poison ivy and seeing her and Arnold as ""Adam and Evil"" was beautiful. Batman in this movie at his best, I thought the costume design made him look exemplary and i thought the nipples were bad-ass.

856,gamezcraze-28257,quite possible the BEST movie ever made,10,24 April 2018,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",Batman & Robin

859,wildeman-3,The worst comic book movie of all time.,1,18 April 2006,"BATMAN & ROBIN.STORY: Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy team up to turn Gotham into a frozen wasteland and it's up to Batman, Robin and Batgirl to stop them. Stupid, isn't it? THE GOOD: Oh man! This movie was nothing but a modern version of the 60's series. The only good thing was Michael Gough as Alfred. Enough said.THE BAD: Where to begin? I'll start with the characters. The movie featured a good cast. We had Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, George Clooney as Batman, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy and Chris O'Donnell back as Robin. Of course, the characters ended up awful. Half of Mr. Freezes lines were lame puns, Uma Thurman tried to be dramatic as Poison Ivy, but ends up going way over the top. George Clooney is good as Bruce Wayne, but plays Batman the EXACT same way he played Wayne. Chris O'Donnell played the character of Robin like he was supposed to, which is a bad thing! And lets not forget Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. The character was uneccessary to begin with, but hiring an awful actress to play her made it even worse.The script is awful. Here are the first lines of the movie.Robin: I want a car, chicks dig the car.Batman: This is why Superman works alone.Not only is Robin's line corny, but Batman mentions another Superhero from an entirely different universe! These two lines sum up the rest of the movie perfectly.The main problem with Batman Forever was that the everything was bright and colourful. It looks even worse here. Mr. Freezes lair (which is an abandoned ice cream store!) is filled with the most unnatural blue I've ever seen. The streets of Gotham glow all sorts of bright colours that will hurt you eyes. I thought this was GOTHam City.The only scene I hated in Forever was when Robin ran off to fight the gang that looked like members of KISS. Batman and Robin is plagued with many scenes just like that. The auction scene was awful. The set was awful looking, and the scene housed the infamous shot of Batman pulling out a credit card as he and Robin bid for Poison Ivy. In another sequence, Poison Ivy takes over the Turkish Baths, which is over run by these freaky looking goblins with pointed ears and bright green face paint. You don't see that in Spider-Man.BOTTOM LINE: This movie was an insult to many people in the world. In fact this movie was so bad, Christopher Nolan had to restart the franchise with Batman Begins. Go see that instead, because this is an awful film that will haunt you for the rest of your life.",Batman & Robin

What direction?,3,6 September 1998,"After all the discussion and anguish over who would play Batman, you'd think that there would've been some thought given to actually developing a story, a script, a REASON for the movie in the first place.  A script that contains only occasionally clever remarks with no dramatic, emotional, or involving direction; action sequences that look more like school yard hijinks; and a score that advances nothing -- all these factors combine to kill this movie.  I recall many reviews stating that ""George Clooney may have killed this franchise"", or words to that affect.  Pulleeaaze!  He didn't stand a chance.  To have a franchise, you need characters, a story, and a reason for watching them.

Joel Schumacher has NOT understood the essence of the bat;he has made a loud,shrill,too colourful comic movie with permanent homo erotic undertones,completely dissatisfying actors and lame dialogues.

866,ymi17,Worst of the big budget?,1,10 December 1998,"I, unlike many people, actually enjoyed Val Kilmer as Batman.  So instead of continuing the at least decent plot line, we bring in some huge stars with little acting ability.  (Wasn't Uma Thurman at one time a respectable actor?)  Well, I guess there's a heartthrob for every age and sex, from Silverstone to Cloonet, but this is a motion picture, not a book of posters. (It would, I must admit, make a very good collection of posters...)",Batman & Robin
867,tao,Avoid at all costs!,1,6 December 1998,"As I said above, avoid. This is a sham and a shame, and I don't recommend it even slightly. The acting was as dry as the Arabian desert, the action was beyond belief and tolerance, and the actors-Yikes! The only reason Clooney and Silverstone got the part was because at the time they were popular, a fad as short lived as Chris Rock. Silverstone as Batgirl was pointless and useless, while Clooney was bland and inhuman, I won't even try to tell you how annoying and immature Robin was. However, the actors can't be blamed, just like in photographs, the photographer is the main ingredient, in movies it is the director and writers. Bob Kane, who was one of the best writers for the Batman series, helped with the first two, with Tim Burton, (best director) Danny Elfman, (best music) and, of course Keaton, (best batman.) Bob Kane should be given the job of writing Batman 5, he would do a better job than the writers now could, and not only because Bob Kane passed on a while ago, but because being placed in a blender on ""liquify"" would be more enjoyable than listening the the countless one-liners spewing forth like so much mindless drivel. Joel Schumacher (is that right?) has managed to not only tarnish, but completely trash the Batman franchise made by Burton. With momotonous thoughtless action scenes, and awful characters, this movie, once part of the proud batman series, now goes on the shelf kept in the back closet of Hollywood. You know, the shelf with all the other American film industry whorehouse classics, such as but not limited to: I still know what you did last summer, The Peacemaker, and, perhaps the most frightening of all, The Blues Brothers 2000. All those movies made the fatal mistake of trying rather blatantly to cash-in on the success of the movies that preceded them, and the belief that most people just want idiotic action, and no actual character development. So, in conclusion, do yourself a favor and don't watch it. It is a supreme waste of time. Instead, do something worthwhile, such as lunge screaming into the freeway, or see how many cans of varnish you can drink in one sitting.

I have nothing against Joel Schumacher, he has made some excellent films in the past, however, he really lacks the vision required in under-taking the Batman franchise.  I realize he probably appeals to the studio exec's, with his high concept ""bright"" or ""light"" approach to this brand of film. However, if he had read the comic book at all, he might have noticed that the whole theme of this series is dark, hence the nick-name Dark Knight. I suppose the director should not be held totally accountable for this film's poor showing.  The production team, actors, studio, and writer's all should have said something.  Who really wants to create a multi-million dollar lint ball? At any rate, Tim Burton really had the right idea with the first two Batmans, and I wish he would resume his former role in this out of control franchise, though maybe it's better left dead.

It has long been my opinion that the Batman movies have gotten progressively worse as each new sequel arrived. The good news for those who actually respect Batman is that I can't see the movies getting any worse.  Batman and Robin was the ONLY movie that I could not finish watching.

Mr. Freeze is full of stupid one liner's and Arnold has none of his usual charisma. They also try to pull heart strings by giving 95 year old Alfred a fatal illness. This series should have stopped when Michael Keaton and Tim Burton where taken out of the project. Clooney and Kilmer both miss the fact that Batman is an alter ego of Bruce Wayne which means that both characters should be treated differently like Keaton did.

While possibly an exaggeration, Batman and Robin was, by far, the worst big budget movie ever.  Nothing can come close.  Even Pauly Shore's worst movie couldn't top this turd of a film.  There are many things we can blame for the supreme badness of Batman and Robin:  Clooney, O'Donnell, Clooney, the script, Clooney, God, Clooney.  But, in reality, Clooney wasn't that bad, (except for the head bob, nod, nod, head bob thing).  And while the script was beyond abysmal, you can't really blame it. No, the man behind the mayhem is the big guy himself... Ahnold. I'm not gonna type his last name, cause I couldn't spell it if I tried. Arnold was bad.  Worse than bad, worse than horrible.  Think of the worst thing you can think of, then think of something 100 times worse.  Arnold was worse than that.  Now, it's true, it was the script that had all the horrible ""cold"" puns, but my pet lemur could deliver them better.  Besides delivering bad puns, all Arnold really did was chew scenery.  And, in the end, that's all he's really good at.  For the rest of the movie, it was just a bunch of crotches.  Crotches and laughably bad action scenes.  And a horrible ""feel good"" ending. In all honesty, the only redeeming quality about this piece of filth was seeing Uma as a redhead in spandex.  Mmm Mmm Good.  But even she acted horribly. I saw this movie with a couple of friends.  Not coincidentally, I'm not in touch with any of them anymore.  This movie was so scarring, that seeing each other brought back the memories, and we couldn't take it.  This is a warning to everyone, please please please, don't see this movie.  Don't even think about it, it'll scan your brain and make your head explode.

George Clooney and Uma Thurman? Come on now--they look like they're about to burst at the seams with laughter (at themselves?) in every scene, even the most somber.

I've never heard such an hysterical script. Did the writers even try?  The actors look embarrassed.  However, I must admit that I did buy the video, which I found for a third of the retail price just weeks after it had been released (though it was purely so I could complete my Batman collection, you understand).

I loved Poision Ivy and Batgirl. The story of how Mr. Freeze, why he was he the way he was just was so interesting to me. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger all together.2. the puns where everywhere... I'm a pun person but it can get annoying quickly. Gorge Clooney would be one of the last people i'd see as Batman. He's alright, but something about his acting just seems too cold for me. I know batman isn't excatally a warm and bubbly character but there is a certain charm that Clooney lacks.My big thing is, probably if they did the movies closely together it would be so much better... like star wars (ep 4-6) or the harry potter ones. Spiderman and Xmen are perfect examples... both comic book movies.I do enjoy watching this movie but then again i enjoy watching it when i'm busy doing stuff so i don't focus on it. just look up for the occasional laugh.Nothing can beat Batman and Batman Returns... then again Michael Keaton will always be the true Batman.... since i'm too young to get into Adam West as Batman lol.",Batman & Robin

885,RayLDaniels,Spoiler Warning: Worst. Movie. Ever.,1,21 August 2008,"In reality, there is no way to spoil this movie for someone. In fact, if anything happens to you preventing you from seeing this colossal heap of steaming dung -- you have the ending spoiled for you, you lose your wallet and can't rent the movie, you get hit by a car and are in the hospital, unable to see Batman and Robin -- then you have truly been saved, as if by Jesus Himself. Considering the money, the actors, the director, all the hype, and the millions who have been duped into witnessing this murderous train-wreck of a film, Batman and Robin is in a class of it's own: It is the worst movie ever to spew out of Satan's lower end. Honestly. To think that human beings -- and not some vile and universal evil force -- made this film should inspire fear and awe. There is only one reason to see this movie, and that is to simply witness history. Batman and Robin is not bad in a funny way. It is not enjoyable to watch this film, even just to make fun of it. It is literally painful to stare at the screen as seizure-inducing images pummel your eye sockets and quality actors assault your ears with campy, brain-activity-retarding one-liners. It is a testament to self-determination and sacrifice if you somehow manage to watch all of Batman and Robin. It is history. . . . A kernel of the worst that humankind is capable of. Did I mention that this movie is bad?",Batman & Robin

887,shawn-279,"Not that bad, but not that great.",5,18 July 2008,"OK, I personally think this movie isn't as bad as everyone else says. It has its good and bad points. First, the things I think that are good. I liked the look of Mr. Freeze. It looks like a scientific creation. I also liked the vehicles, as they bared some resemblance to previous ones. Now for the bad. First, too much color. The Batmobile, the Redbird's ""garage"", the museum, etc. The series wasn't meant to be a colorful one, but a bleak and dark one. That has more to do with the studio wanting a family friendly series after Batman Returns. Second, the casting. George Clooney is not, and never could be a Batman. Alicia Silverstone wasn't a badass biker with combat skills. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a scientist. These were probably chosen because of their popularity at the time. Finally, the Bat-Nipples. Enough said from Joel Schumacher.Not a movie I would recommend. But if you find it on a discount rack, i say go for it.",Batman & Robin
888,andrewj-baxter,Nipples?,1,10 July 2006,"Three words... This movie sucked! For one thing, all the ""actors"" in it shouldn't be in films, except for Arnie. The whole premise of the movie was awful. The bat-suit had nipples for goodness sake. This film deserves to die!!!They should have stopped after the first two, or at least kept Michael Keaton on as batman. At least 'Batman begins' rocked, they can pick up where the first two left off.If you haven't yet witnessed this travesty then you are lucky. DO NOT SEE IT!!!

889,teimour2,UNDERRATED - deserves AT LEAST a 6 or 7,10,27 March 2010,"This is such an underrated movie! Of course this movie is meant for the teen age group (unlike The Dark Knight) and it does have a lot of action and even a little humour, which isn't common in Batman films. Add to that great actors like George Clooney and Arnie the Terminator along with Chris Odonell and the gorgeous Alicia Silverstone and you have an awesome Batman movie, which is, compared to all the other Batman films, the most ""fun"" one. This is also a very original film, complete with a new storyline and lets not forget all the special effects that light up the film. The musical score for this film is also something to mention and should be released as an album. What is different about this film is the fact that even though it is a serious-storyline film, it isn't meant for a ""The Dark Knight"" type audience, the reason being that it is kind of a mix of a superhero film and a cartoon. So great movie, VEEEERY underrated, action packed, and very very fun.",Batman & Robin
890,weve_got_a_bleeder,don't watch this,1,24 June 2005,"This movie is less amusing than watching old people screw. Avoid at all costs. My 3 year old cousin made up a story for Batman one time. It sucked, but it was still better than Batman & Robin. That's how dumb it is. Akiva Goldsman should have been exempt from any Academy Award consideration after this travesty. You have got to hand it to Arnold Swarzenneggar. Only he could pull of lines like ""Everybody chill!"" with a strait face and really mean it. This movie is like the equivalent of 80's cock-rock. All flash, no substance, homo-erotic, and completely serious about what it's doing. I'll put it this way: If you gave a monkey a camera, George Clooney, Swarzenneggar, some spandex, and some lighting gear they would make a more entertaining film.",Batman & Robin

i grew up watching old movies and enjoy them so much.. this batman version, for me is fun, colorful, and theatrical. Maybe the only colorful Batman film that ever made.Uma Thurman as poison Ivy is PERFECT, so sexy and seductive.. Mr.Clonney voice as Batman was superb.. thats how imagine batman as real person. Well i dont really like Alicia as Batgirl, hmmm Dick Grayson overly talkative, but Mr.FREZZE! Woooohh i love Mr.Frezze costume and his background story, about his wife and how he made a transparant tube full of water for her body.. aww so sweet ;))And thumbs up for the film set designers, it's AWESOME.. wow artistic, a little weird but still magicalThis is how u should make film.. please use your imagination.. WHY only make dark version of Batman? Superhero film should be fun for kids to watch and boost their imagination.",Batman & Robin
892,Approaching_c,how did this happen,1,8 October 2006,"I'm stunned by the fact that this movie somehow got the go ahead for production. I have felt since I saw this movie that it is the worst I have ever seen. It is so bad that I have probably brought it up in more conversations than many of my favorite movies. I guess that's something I can give Batman & Robin, it has given me a lot of laughter. If I were to assume that Joel Schumacher is a rational man than I would also have to assume that he did not intend his absurd depiction of the Batman universe to be taken seriously. This movie made it clear that it was time for me to give up on a serious Batman movie coming out of Hollywood. I am now reasonably satisfied after the most recent movie; Batman: the Beginning.",Batman & Robin
893,jadey_griff,Batman and Robin WAS GOOD,8,22 September 2006,I think that this is one of the best films out of the Batman Movies. OK so George Clooney wasn't the best Batman (Micheal Keaton was) but the other villains in Batman Returns - Penguin and Catwoman were just pointless. Poison Ivy has got to be the 3rd best villain behind Joker and Riddler. Anyone who says that Joel Schumacer butchered it needs to watch it again. Mr Freeze could have been made better but I don't think it was that bad. Arnie Swartzenneger played him well. And Chris o Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were good sidekicks although she could have had a better name than BATGIRL. That was pretty lame. So the Best Batman was the original but this one is no where near as bad as everyone makes out.,Batman & Robin
894,Phantasmo777,The key I found to actually enjoy this movie for what it is,7,9 November 2020,"Back in the day, I felt dissapointed when I saw it in theathers and I really disliked the movie for many reasons: it wasn't dark like the first two (same thing for ""Foverer""), the dialogues (""chicks dig the car"") the over-the-top silly acting, the props (batmobile, suits, weapons, etc), the goofy villains... However I loved the colour palette and cinematography - it's pure Schumacher of course.
Over the yearss I have watched it again several times and when the BluRay came out I watched it more in depth, kind of I was ""trying"" to like it - and finally it happened. Why? How? Well, after more than 20 years since it was released means that I'm older too and my thoughts about the movie changed as well. Now when I watch it I feel like I'm watching a ""modern"" take on the 60's TV series and it really makes sense to me for the very same elements I mentioned before: goofy villains, lots of colours, over-the-top cheesy acting, family-friendly overall tone. Gradually I started enjoying the movie in this context and I can say that I like it for what it is.
Unfortunately, this was the latest entry in the ""comic-style"" franchise.",Batman & Robin
895,maggiofamily,bad bad bad bad,1,28 August 2001,"Why, why did they make this movie, I mean batman forever was even pushing it and yet the made another one that was filled with one liners that weren`t funny,(the batcard?) the plot was horrible too, just leave the saga with burton`s two.",Batman & Robin
896,seanravenkamp,Absolute garbage,1,18 July 2021,"This movie is atrocious, if not for the hilariously awful scenes of batgirl fighting poison ivy and some hilariously bad Arnold moments this movie is boring and just plain stupid. One of the worst movies ever made.",Batman & Robin

I wonder how much was spent on affects in both films?",Batman & Robin
898,chimp2k1,Oh dear,1,15 September 2001,"Fantastic. Stunning. Thrilling. It is simply impossible to use these words when describing Batman and Robin. It is the most disappointing film  I have seen my whole life; not the worst, perhaps, but the most disappointing.I don't regard myself a huge Batman fan, but, having read a few comics and seen Tim Burton's films (although Returns isn't a particularly accurate account either) I know Gotham City is not how Joel Schumacher represents it. Too bright, too camp and too cheerily comical (Keaton's cynical humour is far more amusing than Clooney flashing a 'Bat-card') B&R was obviously put together by people who simply did not know Batman. The wasting of good characters like Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane (in the comics he is a sadistic, highly intelligent super-villain) due to the wrong kind of comic book performances really gives true Batman, and movie, fans a painful kick in the teeth. Ouch.",Batman & Robin
899,madlovemonkey,Absolute horse.....,1,1 October 2001,"The Batman series was started by a reimagination by Tim Burton. He took his dark style and adapted it to a tortured comic book hero. The results were pretty good. Batman was a fun flick to watch. Batman Returns was too dark, and so when a motion was put forth to lighten up the next film, Tim Burton walked away. Enter Joel Schumacher. Now, not that Joel Schumacher is evil, but he is kinda. His idea to turn Batman into a big-starred parody somehow managed to go by with little scrutiny with Batman Forever. Probably because there was so much hype. And now Batman and Robin. No need for a good actor, George Clooney says he'll do it. The result is a relative disaster, making all believability and style Batman had go out the window. Joel Schumacher just didn't care about the characters, dialogue, integrity, watchability, anything other than dollar signs...",Batman & Robin

We should have.,1,4 November 2008,"When all the crimes of the 20th Century are tallied, The Nazi Holocaust, The Rawandan Holocaust, and Pol Pot's murders with the Kimeir Rouge, (know I misspelled that), The biggest crime won't be an actual historical event, but a film. A film that placed the greatest action hero in a coma for 8 years. Enter Batman and Robin. This movie was the absolute biggest failure in all of humanity's achievements, rivaling even the Hindedburg. I was fourteen when I watched this, and looking back, I'd rather be molested by my uncle again for a whole year than have to watch nanosecond of Batman and Robin ever again. It wrecked my innocence, it wrecked my life. I still wake up once in a while crying ""I'll cancel the pizza"" Why, why, why god why? This movie is why I'm now an atheist. What just Deity would allow this? Why? My phyciatrist said, I needed to confront this past demon. I watched it again, and now because of those men in the ape suits, I wet the bed again, and have public meltdowns that make my Viet Nam vet uncle fall to his knees. (for different reasons) I'd rather see my grandmother naked again, than sit for a millisecond of Mr. Freeze's ice puns. This movie was rape. Joel Shcumacher should have to tell neighbors that in accordance with Megan's Law, that he is a sex offender. All Batfans need a Nuremberg trial, for Joel Schumacher. I hope Bob Kane's ghost, (he is dead right?) haunts Schumacher for the rest of his life. Thank you, now I can move on with my life.",Batman & Robin
901,rdparty-1,Batman on Ice,1,3 February 2007,"I paid my fee to see all the Batman movies in the theaters when they were released. I loved the first one and saw it several times. I was a huge Batman fan!!! The second was okay... I only saw it once in the theater.I noticed a really downward trend when I went to see the third film, directed by Joel Joel Schumacher. It looked like something that belonged on MTV. The only thing I enjoyed in it was Jim Carrey as the Riddler... As with the second, I only went to see it once. I was really disappointed.Then this piece of garbage came out. When you see previews for the movie on TV that make you think this is poor movie, that's a really bad sign. I took advice to those signs and didn't see it in theaters. I made the right choice as it has gone down in history as one of the worst films ever made. It's painful to see it on reruns on cable. The actors were awful, the story was stupid, the sets were (like the previous film) too cartoon-y.George Clooney, you don't owe me any refund. I was smart enough to avoid this film in the theater. I would be more entertained watching paint dry on the wall (it might have a better story as well).Thank goodness for ""Batman Begins"". A return in the right direction for the story.",Batman & Robin
902,rc_pinchey,"Well, at least it's memorable.",1,26 March 2003,"This is the first film that's inspired me to write a review- and I've seen a lot of films. I never wrote a review for the Shawshank Redemption, an unrivaled work of art which I still find captivating after the hundredth showing. I never bothered typing a word for Memento, a film which demonstrates perhaps the best, and certainly the most original, use of cinema in years. I never reviewed Star Wars, or the Godfather, or Citizen Kane... because this film manages something none of those ever did.This film manages to be the worst film I've ever seen.Now, that's a phrase which is used far too often. Whenever someone sees a film they really dislike, they'll cry ""that was the worst film..."" -but you've got to realize, just because a film was a little dull, or badly acted in places, or didn't seem to go anywhere, doesn't make it ""the worst film I've ever seen"". I'm a big fan of cinema in general, I've seen hundreds of films, and I've put a LOT of thought into this.There are worse films out there, true- Secret Agent Super Dragon, for example, or 95% of the stuff seen on MST3K- but no film I've ever seen has left me with the same sense of crushed disappointment I felt at the end of Batman and Robin. I was a huge fan of the first 2 Batman films. I loved Tim Burton's gothic style, and (with the first film especially) I thought he'd brought the character to the big screen perfectly. Batman Forever was more than a little disappointing, but it was still watchable, so when I got the chance to see THIS I was still a fan of the series. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I WAS expecting an enjoyable film. A good film. A film which someone at some point had put the slightest bit of effort into.I GOT ""You vill not send me to ze cool-ah"". I got the travesty that was this film's portrayal of Bain. I got George Clooney, of all people, in the suit. I got neon, I got a nonsensical plot where two super-villains with completely clashing plans worked together for no apparent reason, I got a script that would make a dyslexic chimp embarrassed, I got the shoddiest (and most expensive) acting performances I've seen in years... I got more than a little dismayed. I still, several years after seeing this travesty, cannot fully comprehend the startling incompetence with which this film was made.I don't think I'll watch this film again- I don't think I could stand it. This, coming from a b-movie fan who collects films starring Dolph Lundgren and has seen ""Invasion of the Saucer Men"" twice (along with most of Billy Drago's early work) should tell you everything you need to know.

Arnold was not convincing as a comic book villain.  He was just too much of a good coming through.  George Cloonye, stepping out of the doctor/lover role, managed to pull off a slick and suave Bruce Wayne, but never convinced me as batman. As for the rest of the leading/supporting cast, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone, Uma Thurman were excellent collectively and had great on screen chemistry.

Enough with this the load of bull that you're feeding Joel Schumacher about this movie, I liked it. It was the best Batman in terms of lines and characters, and it was funny!!! In my mind, this is a somewhat comical film. My personal favorite was Chris O'Donnell with ""NOW WHAT, CALL A TAXI?"" I was actually making a list of what I thought were the 100 funniest films ever, and I considered putting Batman & Robin at around 90. And let Freeze kick some ice while he can. I don't think anyone will ever agree what with I'm about to say, but I really believe this was a step from Val Kilmer's Batman Forever. Enough with bashing this movie, it was very good.

The always terrible Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone are at there worst. And words fail how to describe how bad Arnold Schwarzenegger is. But, the worst offender of all is director Joel Schumacher. He makes Ed Wood look like Tarintino. The best performance comes from Jeep Swenson as Bane. Unfortunaely, Swenson died the year it came out. Sad that this was on his resume. The editor needs to be shot. The ""Hockey team from hell"" sequence should be shown to aspiring editors to show them how not to edit. I will give the editing this, the editing on John McTiernan's ""Rollerball"" redux is worse.

Tim Burton was very dark and to some degree true to the comic books but this time around Joel Schumacher had to make a big pile of campy, cheesy jokes...the Adam West movie was actually less campy (and more entertaining).Warning for spoilers but i have to list some clichés and terrible add-ons that were used.Female villain yelling ""curses!"" before getting defeated. Lead villain saying ""First Gotham...THEN THE WORLD!""...also being a doctor and saying ""Take two of these and call me in the morning...""

910,pesr0412,I think it's a good idea to make a quick retrospective of Batman movies...,1,5 September 2008,"RetrospectiveI think it's a good idea to make a quick retrospective of Batman movies taking this film as a center point where we can view the past and the future of these series...Back in 1989 when the Batman by Tim Burton was released, I was very proud to choose this hero as my favorite one, and in 1992 I was quite happy seeing the hero in the movies was doing as the comics depicted him...Just as in the comics itself, the ""and they lived happily ever after"" does not last forever... Ironically, Batman Forever (I, like many others were attracted by the fact of Batman Returns previous plot) was the warning movie from Joel Schumacher that he was planning to undo whatever Tim Burton created in the past... A real culture of batman fans...Anyway, at least in Batman Forever, the movie was somewhat watchable, but of course, Val Kilmer seemed to be a copy of what he showed us on The Saint and did a less-than-fair performance (who could with Schumacher as a director?, even Pacino would get a F- under his direction)... The warnings? here: While the previous movies used only one single foe (The joker, and The penguin - please note Catwoman was a support friend/foe for the plot not a real foe in strict sense-), in Batman Forever Schumacher uses 2 foes at the same level. Ligths? it looks like Batman Forever started to look somewhat NEONized, but only in green this time (not for been environmentally friendly you know), and more unbelievable. Special effects gaining terrain over the plot...That takes us to the center point of this retrospective, the ultimately named Batman & Robin (wasn't robin already on the previous one?, someone may think that with this title Robin could be an introductory character...) Thus the warnings became true, like an horrible nightmare you had last knight for 5 minutes and today you are scared to sleep knowing that it could last longer... Only this time the nightmare included all... excuse me, rephrasing here: INCLUDED EVERYTHING possible to make this an intolerable film and a true what-not a comic based movie should be.Who decides to change at convenience batman suite, or robin's? Who decided to put Clooney as Batman? Why not me? oh sure, Arnold's salary... is either Arnold or Kilmer, hum... let me see? hey! who's that in the TV series dressed as a doctor? Clooney? never heard of him, but he won't cost much and we still can have Arnold, and then we can still have O'Donnell and miss Clueless, and we can add Thurman... And what about the script or the plot? do we have budget for that? no? leave it to me, I, Schumacher can do anything...And now we have 4 villains and 3 pseudo heroes like some freak show, in electric blue and dozens of extras round an around, and NEON everywhere, was that Gotham City we just passed honey?, oh no sweetie, now the call it Neon City...I don't know if US version of Godzilla is worse, but both of these are serious competitors here... I took 6 years to destroy my pride, now I was walking afraid of someone else could come and bully me: ""ha, this is the guy that thinks Batman is a hero...."" After 8 years, Christopher Nolan decided to resuscitate Batman. He now used a true dark actor, Christian Bale (the American psycho) to perform the role of the dark knight... In this role, Bale, in my opinion, outperforms Keaton's representation back in 1989. Returning batman to what is it from the comics where the character came originally. A true piece of artwork if you let me...and just this year, The Dark Knight proves that Nolan did it again with a new version of what The Joker is. I do think Nicholson's is the ONLY characterization that resembles what The Joker is. Ledger's one is marvelous also, but it pales in comparison.Hopefully, if Hollywood decides to deliver a new one, it could be possible to be a good one. In the meantime, I feel satisfied with my pride restored, but deep in my heart I fear that some ""Schumacher"" wannabe may be around waiting for the possibility to destroy what Nolan recreated after 8 years... Nolan should be Batman's hero...",Batman & Robin

I had seen every Batman movie except this one and I heard many awful things about it, but since my movie taste isn't always the norm I decided to watch anyway and go into it with an open mind. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing but I had no idea that a movie could actually be this bad. Let's start from the beginning, from the moment Batman and Robin suit up you can tell this movie will be a complete joke. Director Joel Schumacher shows each body part of each guy tightly suited in rubber (and let's not even get started on the Bat nipples.) As the movie progresses we hear some of the corniest dialog in movie history such as ""The IceMan cometh"". Throughout the whole movie the acting only remains average. George Clooney gives a rather dull performance as Bruce Wayne and Chris O'Donnell just acts like an annoying little kid. It is hard to understand one word Arnold says and Alicia Silverstone manages to make Batgirl even more obnoxious than the idea of the character already is. Despite her Razzie nomination I found Uma Thurman to be the only enjoyable performer of the entire film. The film lacks action, has sets that look like they were made by a high school art class, and has the most idiotic Bane ever. This is movie is a complete mess with an outrageous plot and will probably go down as one of the worst films in history. R.I.P. Batman!",Batman & Robin

This is just ridiculous fun, and if you want a movie to watch when you don't feel like having your brain worked, an emotional tear jerker, or a sappy romantic comedy, this is the best movie.You can tell the characters had a lot of fun being extremely over the top, and that translates for some awful groans from the puns (Ice to meet you), but it also delves the viewer into a comic book world completely separate from reality. The insane sets and the bright lights of Gotham are as brilliant as Batman Forever and Batman Returns, but this movie is just far more corny. I love this movie, and believe the people who are hard on it are movie snobs that don't know how to let loose and enjoy some old fashioned campy fun.",Batman & Robin

Name any aspect of the movie, and it will not only succeed in doing it badly, but doing it the WORST of any movie in the history of motion pictures. Every single actor in it, talented or Alicia Silverstone, gives the worst performance of their career, and coupling that with the unending Ice puns, ridiculous clichés, the horrific special effects, the Bat credit card, the undermining of all of the main themes of Tim Burton's original 'Batman', a sidekick that can only be described as Jar Jar Binks and Short Round put together, and you have HALF of what makes this movie as bad as it is. IMDb, make a 0 rating!!!",Batman & Robin
918,TheBatmanJesus,"I was going to write a Batman related pun for the summary, but this movie just isn't worth the effort",3,21 December 2010,"It's ironic really that one of the only Batman movies that doesn't feature the Joker is naught but a big joke - and whilst it has its moments; this is seriously disappointing stuff from the man who brought us The Lost Boys. Batman and Robin is laughably poor, and I mean that in the most literal sense imaginable. I honestly couldn't control my bursts of hysterics when it came to some of the cheesier and most cringe-worthy moments. I'm not going to lie, the cast is pretty solid, but they all seem as though they're in the complete wrong movie. Most of those actors in like an all-stars film or something, is something I'd be interested to see. I'll talk more about this later, but really the casting is one area that is a particular downfall as far as Batman movies go. Looking back on my list of pros and cons, I was hugely surprised by the incredible amount of positive things I had written down about this movie, considering my overall impressions. I knew I'd been writing them as I went a long, and so obviously wasn't completely keeping track of everything I put, because I was trying to concentrate on the film at the same time. It was only when I realised that at least five of my pros had the words 'Alicia' and 'Silverstone' in them, that it started making sense. In all fairness though, you can't blame me.So the plot line. My question is: what plot line? There definitely is one, but it's so confused, random and complex that even I couldn't cope. I mean hell, I understood what was happening, but I didn't have a clue Why it was happening. It was all just a hapless mishmash of completely unrelated sub-plots that apparently are somehow connected; yet this is in the craziest, most non-sensical ways imaginable. Somehow every single one of these manic and ridiculous plot-threads is geniously interwoven. I have to say, the writer deserves props for that, because it would have taken either a total genius, or a complete off-the-wall, asylum-bound retard to piece the puzzle together quite the way they did. Then again, simply watching this film makes you feel like a complete off-the-wall, asylum-bound retard, so I guess in that respect it really does capture the true spirit of Batman.Back on the subject of the cast, I think they could've done worse, but as I said, they don't really scream out BATMAAAAAAAN. George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger are on usual ass-kicking meets great acting form; Chris O'Donnell plays the whiny little bitch well; Uma Thurman is a little over the top (I mean I know Poison Ivy is meant to be over the top, but in some places she just takes it a bit too far); and Alicia Silverstone is... Alicia Silverstone. Nuff said. However I did have some problems with the cast other than the Poison Ivy bit I mentioned: Commissioner Gordon just doesn't seem right; Mr Freeze won't stop spouting one-liners and puns, which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one; and although George Clooney makes a decent Batman, some segments just take the 'family friendly' nature of the movie a bit too far, with such infamous moments as the bat credit card scene just being overly cheesy. I don't know/care who plays Bane, but the overall look, and performance just sucks. I'm just gonna lay it down, no fluff... it sucks. Although thankfully, this movie can say that it has John Glover in its cast (which it does), which, although his appearance is lamentably brief, is sort of a saving grace. Seeing Lionel Luthor (Smallville) in yet another comic related thing is awesome. Another thing that got me is: when did Barbara Gordon become Barbara Pennyworth?That was my main problem with this movie: the sheer 'cheese factor'. Some of the fight-scenes were just far too badly done, although there is a fairly decent fight with Bane near the end. Most of the fighting just isn't that well choreographed in my opinion, and just enhances the overall cheesiness.One particular scene that really got to me was the one right at the beginning where Mr Freeze is stealing the diamond from the museum. The whole hockey thing. Just didn't impress me, and it really didn't give me a good impression of what was to come, although it does adequately set the tone for the rest of the movie. I must say Poison Ivy and Mr Freeze's escape from Arkham is fairly epic, and that part actually did impress me. Another thing that didn't though, were some of the sound effects. The cartoony *phwiiiiiing*, and such really don't fit with the rest of the movie, and the tone it's trying to set. I mean, as far as I'm aware, this movie is actually trying to take itself seriously - amazingly. So the cartoon style sound effects just don't work.The music was decent, true Batman type stuff, although Danny Elfman's scores will always take the forefront in my mind.Overall, this movie was better than I'd expected. I'd heard some really awful things about it, and whereas it really is a poor piece of cinema, I don't quite think the hate is entirely warranted. Some parts of the story are actually pretty good, and the end is really quite touching... and then they ruin it by doing a slow-mo run with capes billowing in the wind. THE END WAS GOING SO WELL. I was like, thank God it's ditched what has been an ever present feature in this movie to revert to some traditional story-telling... oh no wait, Batman, Robin and Batgirl running, spotlit in slow-motion, their capes blowing behind them. What a way to spoil the end of a movie! Couldn't they have just rolled the freaking credits? Either way, this film is bad, but still not something that's complete bargain bin trash.",Batman & Robin
919,kurtbatz,The biggest waste of money in the history of film?,1,12 June 2003,"This is a shambling, wretched, desperately unfunny, feeble, irritating, dirge of a film. It takes everything that was so great about the first two films in the franchise (the superb goth ambience, dark and intense atmosphere etc) and throws them out of the window, in a return to the ghastly, high camp 'tights and all' style of the original 60's series. Minus the laughs.It has no redeeming features whatsoever, is apallingly miscast and watching the film from beginning to end is one of the worst tortures that could be inflicted on mortal man.Arnie is miscast as Mister Freeze, George Clooney is woeful as Batman, Robin is cringeworthy, the sets are garish and tacky beyond belief... I could go on for days about what makes this film so bad, and still not have it all covered.Do yourself a favour.

When you think of terrible movies you might think of Gigli, From Justin to Kelly, Battlefield Earth, or Glitter. What should come to mind is this piece of crap known as ""Batman and Robin"". It's hard to tell how this movie went bad because there are so many poor spots in it. From cheesie sets to horrific, uninspired acting, there are exactly no redeeming traits about this movie. In fact, it is so horrible that the only way the studio can continue to peddle it is by attaching it to the better two Batman movies in the ""four for one"" pack that you see in most retail stores.

The second thing that made me hate this movie was the ridiculous one liners. I mean maybe it's cool to have like 1 in an entire movie but to have them say one every minute? No.About a quarter of the way through Batman & Robin I just gave up on taking it seriously and just let myself laugh. If I didn't know better I would have thought this movie was a spoof.Not to mention the movies terrible makeup on Bane, I mean, are those supposed to even look like veins? The scene that made me laugh the hardest, though, was when Bane was setting up the bombs and every time he put one down he'd say ""Bommmb!""

Pretend it never happened. As far as I am concerned, there have only been 2 Batmans ever made, one with Michael Keaton with a terrible Prince soundtrack, and one with Christian Bail. The other Batmans should be destroyed. The entire concept of Batman has only been pulled on once, in the latest Batman Begins movie, the first could be tossed into mix for good measure as an after thought so long as we ignore the fact that Gotham isn't aware of Batman during this film.

Unfortunately, this movie is so pointless and nonsensical that it became painful to watch rather then (unintentionally) funny.I've never really liked the Batman movies, but at least some of them had some memorable roles in them (Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman). In this part, only Uma Thurman is passable as Poison Ivy, the rest of the performances is too terrible to mention. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the villain proves once and for all that he can't act and his puns are beyond pathetic. George Clooney as Batman? Aargh ! The poor performances would have been acceptable if there had been any kind of good story or good action. Unfortunately, the story tries to cover way too many things at once (TWO villains, BatGirl & Robin, the disease of the butler) and ends up being mostly boring. In terms of action, most scenes are completely ridiculous, the one-liners are forced and not funny, and the props look like they were taken from the original Star Trek series.",Batman & Robin

Now he's a blue person with a fetish for ICE and saying ""FREEZE"" and ""CHILL"" often! It doesn't make it better with his raging German accent. I see no reason to point out why this movie is bad, because it pretty much speaks for itself. If you ask me if it is worth watching? Only with your friends' company.

I wish I could put 0. Awful isn't bad enough. Disgraceful. Ludicrous. Not a real movie. I wanted to cut myself. I wanted to cut Joel Schumacher. If I had the chance, I would rewrite that script, get new actors, direct it myself and send it out in the world. I can't believe that people say he ruined the franchise because of this because it wasn't a real Batman Movie. I think they should turn the film in for scrap and it should be taken away from the history of human events. I mean there are bad films. Biodome, Butterfly Effect, Episode One, Daredevil, Staying Alive, Rocky 5 but this . . .this is a travesty. This is something I wouldn't even watch to make fun of. I even said this with watching Daredevil but looking back on it, I wasn't devastated when I came out of it. Maybe it's because Batman is my personal favorite superhero and when I saw the film, it destroyed my faith in human ability to have 1 ounce of talent at all times. But even that isn't it. It was just bad. We should ban the movie. And honestly, I respect some of Joel Schumacher's films. I don't even dislike Batman Forever that much. But if I had made this film, I would have never touched a script again. Honestly. Or I would have at least come to terms with my creation of a natural disaster and burned every scrap of film.

I would def. see this movie. Bringing Alicia in the movie as Batgirl was a great addition. Seeing Batman, Robin, and Batgirl all together was great.

Seriously, this movie is too comical, because the director wanted to make it more kid friendly-leaving the rest of us with a really bad movie. The acting is NOT good.

934,sethrat,can you say EWW,1,21 July 2004,"Batman is grim, mysterious, troubled, a little insane and smart. He didn't just get some superpowers and become superior over everybody, he had to work for it. He spent a long time working to become amazing at every aspect of crime solving and crime fighting. And Batman and Robin isn't even worthy of calling the man in that movie a name even close to resembling to that of Batman. First, they got George Clooney to play the part. A pretty-boy wussy who can't even begin to play the part of Batman. They made the whole movie way too emotional. Especially with the whole ""Alfred's got a disease that's going to kill him and we've got to find a cure!"" The script was AWFUL with pathetic puns and horrible little lines that make a truly miserable attempt at humour. With villains as cool as Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy played by Arnold Schawrzenegger and Uma Thurman you'd think at least the bad guys would be good. But they also fell short, but who wouldn't with lines like that? And then there was Bane. If anyone knows anything about the REAL Bane, they'd know that he is SMART. He is skilled in fighting and doesn't just go around and punch things that other people tell him to. The special effects were also some of the worst I've seen. With glow in the dark face paint and stupid looking hideouts for the bad guys. the bat-mobile also had glowing lights--real stealthy. When will they make a GOOD Batman movie?

Alfred Pennyworth is like a father to Bruce Wayne. When a man who is like a father is dying, it's anything but amusing. That was bad acting on Clooney's part and bad directing on Schumacher's part. Two, Batgirl is supposed to wear a cowl like Batman. But in this movie, her mask looks more like Robin's than Batman's. Three, Freeze shot ice out of the telescope to freeze Gotham City.

942,zduvvian,The Most Over-hated Movie In History,7,14 August 2013,"When I see reviews for the movie 'Batman and Robin', people always seem to say that it is an awful movie and one of the worst films ever made. I have seen it, and to be honest, I really like it. It is campy and a little stupid, but it really doesn't deserve to be given the same title given to other horrible movies like 'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie' or 'Jaws: The Revenge'.I'm not saying that people should stop hating on this movie (because I can see what people have against it) but I do think that people need to calm down about it. There are far worse superhero movies out there like 'Superman IV' and 'Catwoman'.Onto the film itself, like I said, I can see what people have against it: ""The acting is awful, the story is campy and the movie overall isn't well directed"".I don't think the acting is that bad. There are a few characters who are terrible (like Batgirl, who was meant to be British but it is obvious that the actress is American), but some characters do pretty good performances. George Clooney does a good job as Batman, Michael Gough does a great job as Alfred, Uma Thurman is a convincing Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pretty funny Mr Freeze (although I do agree that most of his ice puns are painful). The rest of the characters are pretty mediocre, but not terrible.The story is no Oscar-winning masterpiece, but it is still a good story that flows well. The (very) basic plot synopsis is that Batman and Robin are trying to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City and taking over the world. (Of course!)That may sound like a boring and clichéd story, but it is actually quite good. The sub-plots fit into the story perfectly, especially one about Alfred dying of MacGregor's Syndrome.Overall, I feel that Batman and Robin is one of the most over-hated movies of all time and should really be given a chance. Like I said, it isn't perfect, but it really isn't as awful as everybody says. If you watch the movie with the knowledge that is a campy flick, you'll have a good time, just don't listen to the people who say that it is a horrible abomination to cinema, because it really isn't.7/10P.S. - If you want to know what I think of Bane, I think he is closer to the comics than Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' because the inclusion of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength.",Batman & Robin
943,maddoggnwa,What The F#ck,1,17 June 2005,I have been a Batman fan all my life and I thought that this movie was the worst Batman movie that I have seen. All the Actors where not right for the movie. And I hate the fact that they got the story line wrong. I thought that it was wrong what they did to Bane. In the books he was smart but in the movie he was a retard. And Batgirl was not a part of Alferd's family. It was not Barbara Wilson it has always been Barbara Gordon. Commissoner Jim Gordon's doter. And I also think that they got Mr. Freeze wrong. I meen I think that Arnold Schwarzeneggere is a good actor but he was not right for Mr. Freeze. And George Clooney jest was not right for the part of Batman but I will say that he did a good job still.Thank YouMad Dogg,Batman & Robin
944,PCon,Bright side: it led to a restart of the franchise!!,1,13 March 2005,"People say this movie is just the worst batman-related film of all times (probably they don't count Catwoman, anyway). Well, they are right. Sometimes I wonder if Joel Schumacher have ever watched Batman. Maybe he just hates Batman that he just wanted to kill it. Look at Phone booth! You cannot even imagine that they were directed by the same person. Whenever I watched this, I could not help asking myself,'Is some parts of the movie supposed to be funny?' Arnold the Mr.Freeze, Alicia the Batgirl (who is Alfred's niece! Can you believe this??).. The castings are just all wrong! It seems that nothing is considered positive in this movie! Well, but look at the bright side, if there is not Batman and Robin, WB may never restart the franchise and get a all-star cast in Batman Begins.

945,mstafford1284,An absolutely dismal outing,1,22 June 2005,"This film has but one saving grace - that it was so bad it brought about a rethink toward the franchise and led to the subsequent filming of Batman Begins. George Clooney is by no means capable of taking on the complex character that is Bruce Wayne and is far more suited to gracing the pages of celebrity magazines, the costume and set design were atrocious and a gross departure from the comics and original vision of Batman. And look for the scene where Chris O'Donnell appears from the water and the footage is actually reversed to make him seem to submerge - editing at its worst!

I would like to see you try and write a better screenplay or direct this film better than it was produced.I wasn't really looking to ramble on in this comment, but I need 10 lines or more. So, the action and plot in this movie entertained me when I was younger and could still do so at the age of 18.

Good IL' Joel Schumacher appears on the stand wearing a batman suit WITH nipples and Randall's only comment was, ""Man Batman and Robin was so gay!"" which lead to cartoon Joel breaking down and crying.

And by the way you did not need that many puns we get it he can use Ice and poison ivy can use plants and do not even get me started on bane that was horrible I hope Schumacher and even the actors never wanted to do this you have to have your heart into a performance . finally I will say one positive thing about this movie the Bat mobile was kind of cool.,Batman & Robin

All the actors is totally #%¤, and to save the whole thing someone got Arnold to join the making the movie. He just runs around screaming: Freeze, Chill, Cool party, Let me break the ice, and so on! And so much for the duo, when they suddenly finds a black-leather-dressed woman, who of course saves them both. Personally I think that batman is best of by himself, they could at least give Robin a dress in one or two colors, and it would be great if those colors didn't come from opposite parts of the RGB scale.As you might have understood by now, this is not a good film, but you should definitely see it, because you can laugh at its pointlessness.",Batman & Robin

I remember Clooney as a perfectly charming and intense Batman and Arnold at his self- deprecating silliest, portraying a wonderfully funny supervillain.

""The Ice Age!"" - Mr. Freeze tries to give a history lesson, but,instead, becomes Gotham City's #1 village idiot in the homoerotic, eternally hellacious, gangrene celluloid cheese rot that is ""Batman & Robin"" Three words for ""Batman & Robin"".This movie BLOWS.First off, George Clooney didn't kill off the ""Batman"" franchise. He was, in my eyes, the only small saving grace to this gas-bag of a film.My eternal double middle-finger waving will go to director Joel Schumacher for making a homo-erotic (Schumacher has to be gay. Nipples, again, on the bat-suits. What the F***?!?!)irresponsible, fast tracked, plot less flaming piece of bat gwano.""Batman & Robin"" should be avoided at all costs, and the U.S. Government should put a gag order on future production of the DVD, and fine ""Warner Bros."" for entertainment terrorism. Or, better yet, use the DVD as a torture device, by having captured members of Al Quaida watch the film repeatedly until they crack. Trust me, it won't take long.Batman & Robin go up against the ever asinine Mr. Freeze, who is robbing Gotham City of its diamond supply so that he can power his nipple encrusted, metal ice suit & also power his giant ice ray that will put all of Gotham in a permanent deep-freeze.If that isn't enough to have you stopping the DVD and using it as a frisbee, there is the origin of Poisin Ivy, and with her assistant Bane, comes to Gotham City to turn the city into her own private garden.The cast is forgettable. One word for Schwarzenegger. RETIRE. I know he is the Governor of CA, but after he serves his term in office, do you think he is going to go off into the much deserved sunset? Nope. I have a strong feeling that he will continue to make crap like this until people just stop going to see his films (he reached his peak with ""T2"" & has yet to, quality wise, match that film, let alone, surpass it).Silverstone is 2 dimensional as Batgirl & did the film really need her anyway? I was waiting for Batmite to *u*king show up for God's sake! O' Donnell's' Robin was annoying to the point where if Batman gave him a good smack across the face, he would have gone into a fullbody temper tantrum.Uma is sexy as Poison Ivy but can't save the sinking ship.The plot line is asinine and foolish (any plot line from the 60's T.V. series would have been better than this).Using Bane as a supporting character, & worse yet, as comic relief is an abomination. He is without a doubt one of the most dangerous of all Batman foes (possibly right behind the Joker and Hush) & the chance to use this great villain was thrown away.The DVD is a waste, with no extras, not even an apology from ""Warner Bros."" for having this stinking, pile of monkey doodoo released upon the innocent public.",Batman & Robin
953,Johnny-1810,Batman & Robin... and Batgirl?,3,30 March 2008,"Having firmly established a fan-base for the crime-fighting adventures of the Dark Knight in the late 80s and early 90s, I'm sure Warner Bros. released 1997's 'Batman & Robin' with high hopes. With a new Batman (George Clooney), two reliably nasty villains (Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Joel Schumacher - whose previous work included 'St. Elmo's Fire' (1985), 'Flatliners' (1990) and the previous Batman film 'Batman Forever' (1995) - once again directing, the premise looked good.Unfortunately, the product did not live up to the expectations.'Batman & Robin' is a shambolic mess of a comic book movie, with a lazy plot and an even lazier script. The thoroughly uninteresting story follows Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson - a.k.a. Batman and Robin - as they battle against the villainous Mr. Freeze, a doctor who once accidentally fell into a tank of freezing cold ice and water and whose life is now consumed by ice, from his secret frozen hideaway right down to his ice-covered dressing gown. Mr. Freeze is hell-bent on holding Gotham City ransom by covering it in impenetrable ice.Things get worse for our heroes when Dr. Pamela Isley, a scientist, is consumed by her poisonous plants and turned into Poison Ivy, who somehow has the ability to seduce any man by blowing some chemicals in his direction. Ivy eventually joins forces with Mr. Freeze and aids him in his diabolical plans.Meanwhile, Alfred the butler's niece turns up at Bruce's mansion and insists on helping the caped crusaders in their fight against crime. The point of this character is something I've yet to discover, other than to add another female presence to the story. Her character is eventually given an alter-ego - Batgirl. But by that time, the film has long developed into a farce, so the addition of this largely useless character is not surprising.This film's problem - other than that plot - is that it leans too much towards the camp and comical stylings of the TV series from the 1960s. During the opening battle sequence with Mr. Freeze and his ice hockey-playing thugs, I half-expected the words 'POW!' and 'CLUNK!' to appear in big colourful letters across the screen. If the film was intended to be a comedy, this might have worked. But it insists on taking itself seriously, and thus causes its downfall.Of course, this isn't the only problem. The script is appalling. Packed full of corny one-liners - the majority of them from Schwarzenegger (""Let's kick some ice!"") - it almost makes you want to turn the sound off and watch the film on mute. The actors seem embarrassed when speaking their lines; most of all Clooney, who must have thought his career was all but finished after seeing the final cut.Clooney himself is one of the few plus points from the film. He does what he can with the script, and it's an assured, reliable performance as Bruce Wayne. Regrettably, scenes involving Wayne out of his Batsuit are often spoilt by the irritating presence of his partner. No, not Elle Macpherson, the other one. Chris O'Donnell plays Robin like a spoilt, petulant child. A deeply unlikeable character that served as an annoying tag-along in 'Batman Forever', and simply as a nuisance in this film. If anything, I'm glad this ended up being the last movie in the run purely so we didn't have to see O'Donnell in the role again.Schwarzenegger is his usual enthusiastic-but-clunky self, while Uma Thurman is uncomfortably and needlessly over-the-top and has her own share of cringe-worthy lines (""Come join me. My garden needs tending"" is perhaps unintentionally hilarious).Despite its obvious and numerous failings, the film does boast a few positives. The special effects involving Mr. Freeze's various ice attacks are nice to look at, and there is a scene towards the end with Bruce and Alfred that is genuinely touching.These few high points, however, fail to disguise what a disjointed, lazy, and downright ridiculous film it is. Warner Bros. quite rightly cancelled plans for a fifth one after this. To be perfectly honest, it was one film too late.And as for the Dark Knight himself... well let's say he has a certain Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale to thank for saving his image.3/10.",Batman & Robin
954,kingdarthrog,New perspective on Joel Schumacher.,6,23 August 2014,"Before you disregard this review and call me a hack who knows nothing about movies hear me out. Joel Schumacher's infamous re-imagining of the iconic Batman may just be one of the most genius remakes yet. This movie on surface level is complete bunk, filled with horrid one liners, poorly written villains, and a Chris O'Donnell's confused character motivations. But, if you put that aside and picture this film as a homage to the classic 1960's Adam West Batman, then it becomes something completely new. Yes of course the flaws are prominent but as a campy throwback film it's actually a quite genius film.",Batman & Robin
955,josephcurran,Worst Movie I've ever seen,1,3 September 2014,"This movie was more of a failed comedy rather than an action movie. It spit in the face of the Batman movies of the past and nearly killed the series until Nolan made his 8 years later. Every thing about this movie sucked from the acting to the plot to the script and the worst part of the movie was the costumes that made you want to tear your eyes out. Whose idea was it to put the nipples on the bat suit? Uma Thurman's Ivy suit was a failed attempt to make her look sexy, don't get me wrong she is a very attractive lady the suit was too much. The only semi cool costume was Mr. Freeze who was poorly portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Speaking of poor portrayal this movie had pretty promising cast but a major swing and miss. George Clooney I love him but this is his most disappointing movie. Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were both so bad I wanted to puke after I saw them. Uma Thurman was the best one out of all of them but even she didn't do a good job. Don't even get me started on Bane. The plot was lacking to a point where it's Batman and Robin fighting each other instead of Freeze, Ivy and Bane. Now on to the script all the corny dialogue and all the puns got really annoying really fast. How this movie is not in the IMDb bottom 100 baffles me. So in conclusion this movie was ruined by awful costumes, terrible plot line, really bad acting and eye shattering costumes.",Batman & Robin
956,DazzaBrownsword,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,17 September 2014,"When I first saw the ""Dark Knight Rises"", I didn't really like it, but after a few times, thought it was pretty good. I hoped that with Batman and Robin it would be the same. It wasn't... The franchise began in 1989 with Tim Burtons ""Batman"" (1989), and I thought that was awesome! Batman Returns was a bit more Gothic, but Keaton was still good as Batman. I even quite liked Batman Forever, because I like Jim Carrey, but Batman and Robin ruined it all.Freeze: A really low role for Schwarzenegger, with puns like ""Freeze"" every 5 minutes. Not a chilling villain at all (No pun intended)Bane: Could have done a lot with this character, with him being an ultimate destruction machine, but no... He's taken down by Alicia Silverstone and Chris O'Donnell!Robin: Whines on for the whole movie and one of my least favourite actors.Alfred: An actor who had been in the first 3 movies, and in my opinion done a great job. But somehow he is now Dying of some imaginary disease, for which Freeze gives Batman the cure!Batman: I'm not even going to bother...So overall a really bad movie, and I've actually watched it about 3 times, and it hasn't gotten any better with time... To me, It'll always be the movie that ruined one of my Favourite franchises.",Batman & Robin

I don't really do this and this is my first time writing something on IMDb. Of course no one will care about my opinion, since nobody cares about this old movie in 2015 anyways, but I just feel the need say something.Now, first of all, I'm not comic book guy, I know nothing about comic books, I never read one in my life so far. But I like Batman. I like movies, ""Arkham"" game series and so on.So I just finished watching all 4 older Batman movies (1989 - 1997) and I really liked first 3 movies. Then time came to Batman & Robin, ""worst movie ever made"", and I thought this should be bad... But I can't just drop last movie...So there it goes... The reason why everyone hates this so much, is because most of those people are comic book fans or something like that, at least I think so. Yeah, movie was bit cheesy and some parts were like ""WTF"" (and actually made me laugh), like ice skates in bat suit? That is convenient... or air surfing on a metal doors from a rocket? Yeah, that was so stupid, that it was funny. It felt like cheesy comedy about Batman, with all those jokes and one liners. And that was fine by me. Of course it was not as close as good as first one, or as any of 3 movies before, but 1 out of 10? Worst movie ever made? Not by a long shot. There is tons of really terrible movies, and this one just don't fit among them. All those ""1 out of 10"", ""Worst movie ever created"" and so on, I think is just a butt-hurt comic book nerds are talking.Well, that is all I have.

Don't even get me started on Chris O'Donnell possibly the most annoying character I have ever seen. Not let me set the scene... Film opens, video of batman in his suit with nipples, really?? Then the batmobile appears not good either. We then get a line from Robin ""chicks dig cars"" if you think this is bad you should listen to Arnie.

I had to make this review just because it brought on the wave of hate I had the first time I saw it. I love Batman. Ever since I picked up my first comic, he was an instant favorite. Then this movie appeared and destroyed that image of the bat. I have no idea what Joel Schumacher was thinking. Sure, it can remind you of the 1960s show, but other than a tiny bit of nostalgia, this movie is terrible. I have no idea what batman movie the people who gave this movie 5 or above were watching. They honestly have no idea who the dark knight really is. Batman is supposed to be a man that strikes fear into the heart of his enemies. Not some crappy, pun-making wannabe bat. Chris O'Donnell was just an annoying portrayal of the boy wonder and don't even get me started on bat girl. Mr. Freeze is supposed to be an intelligent villain with a superior aura around him. In the movie he's some idiotic meat head shouting out way too many puns. Uma Thurman as poison ivy could've worked out if there was a better director and screen writer at that time, but I digress.

You'd have to be mentally deficient to not understand that all the stuff you criticize it for is done on purpose. This movie is an obvious tribute to the old comic-books stories and to Adam West's Batman. Like the tv-series featuring Adam West, what makes it so fun is the fact that you never truly get if it is intentional comedy or not while you watch it. I mean, like I said you do get it if you have a functioning brain, but it's the kind of comedy that works because they don't throw a bunch of lame jokes at you (*coff-coff suicide squad coff coff*) but they keep it really subtle and you actually have to use your brain a little bit to really get all the absurd and nonsensical stuff that happens and laugh. I also loved the settings, the colour palette, the over-the-top villains and the pacing of the movie. So if you don't have a sense of humour and like to watch hearthless, soul-less movies that feature a bunch of people talking in colourless settings and 3 minutes of actual superheroes doing stuff, go watch suicide squad, the amazing spiderman or batman v superman.

Very predictable storyline, terrible gimmicks and the props were bad as well. Clooney made Batman look weak and he even made the character look short. Batman is suppose to be a powerful figure and Clooney gave the role a pathetically whimpy aspect.

970,hanniballectar87,ouch,4,15 November 2005,this movie had OK music and the costumes looked OK saying that what happened to batman. robin go away you aren't a good actor and this film was boring and batman was to short. the movie was like a real life comic book with all the stupid larger than life stuff in the cities this movie should never made it into the movies. you see batman begins batman and batman returns. very good movies but batman forever started to go the way batman and robin ended up. all the actors walked like they had something up there backsides. i grew up with these movies and this was a waste of money back when it came out. anyway if you are a die hard fan of batman and haven't let seen this then watch it but you have been warned,Batman & Robin
971,simchawaldman,Bandwagon effect,10,9 July 2019,"Batman and Robin is one of my favorite films. The effects are just great. The plot is not dark and scary. As a kid I did not notice the puns through the film.The public and media just love to jump on the ""Bandwagon"" - they can go suck it for all I care.I also cannot understand why many of the cast actors regret it, and how many use this as an excuse to pore hate on Chris O'Donnell - a down-to-earth family person, something which not everyone gets to earn.If I ever meet Joel Schumacher and Chris O'Donnell in my lifetime, I would shake their hands very hard and tell them: ""WELL DONE!""22 years after, I feel very sad that the second film originally planned was cancelled, and that history never made its path through there.",Batman & Robin
972,ulsef,worst superhero movie ever!!!!!!,1,11 September 2005,this is the first of the batman franchise films that i didn't see in the cinema. i taped it on TV and have tried on more than one occasion to watch it. i have not been able to get more than halfway through this piece of rubbish. i love superhero films and i am a longtime reader and collector of comics. i even have some affection for the campy old batman TV show. but this is too much. unwatchable. all the characters are spewing out cheap one liners like some awful upn sitcom. arnold's status as the finest thespian of our age has been put in serious jeopardy by this film. a cardboard cutout could have put more spirit into the role of the dark night than george clooney. other potential superhero film directors should take heed of the miserable failures artistically in this film. this sort of thing should not happen again.,Batman & Robin
973,neillstringer1,A camp dip for the Dark Knight,2,20 June 2008,"One of worst films ever made? Yes. Corny one liners from Arnie and silly coconut head sound effects are an embarrassment.Yet it still has a few interesting set pieces and a great performance from Michael Gough as Alfred. The score by Elliot Goldenthal is actually really good, not as good as Danny Elfman's scores for Batman and Batman Returns but still good.Batman took a real nose dive with this two hour toy commercial which defaced Batman for cheap laughs and big bucks for kids to buy that toy Batmobile with the lighting for the engine stolen from a trashy caberet nightclub.In its defense it does successfully convey the 60s era of Batman with its camp tone but that ain't a good thing. However, the 60s series was never this dire. The plot line for the Batman movies were always pretty thin but this was the thinest of them all, the problem it has too many heroes and 3 villains. With so many heroes and villains none of them were done right.George Clooney was too nice and fuzzy to make a good Batman, yet his suave demeanour works well for his portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell was reduced to making Robin a whiny kid and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl is just a complete waste of time with a crappy origin just to get little girls to see a Batman film.Schwarzenegger was clearly miscast in this movie, all sympathy for Freeze is lost with Arnie's awful ice puns. Puns trying to cash in on his action films from the 80s. I loved his back story about his wife but it worked so much better in the animated series of the early 90s. Uma Thurman's performance was interesting and fun. Her Mae West voice was quite amusing and one of the highlights in the film.On the two disc Special Edition, which is a good package, Joel Schumacher apologises. Strange thing is that this film is one film I always end up wanting to watch when I am feeling down.I recommend watching the film with the riff trax from Mike Nelson.",Batman & Robin
974,rockymarciano-09254,The most over-hated movie in history,10,15 October 2017,"I used to love this movie, and I were 9 years old then. In my opinion this a family movie, movie for children and actually that is what Batman is supposed to be like. There is no such thing as real Batman, and serious Batman story with some deeper meaning, that should require. BATMAN IS A KIDS FICTIONAL MOVIE!",Batman & Robin
975,funkyjon23,Worst batman ever,1,26 November 2005,"OK, where to begin, i saw this movie awhile back thinking it be as good, if not better then the other batman movies.. but i was dead wrong! i think they spent more thought on how man cheese action scenes and corny puns they can fin into a move. George colony is by far the worst bat man next to val kilmer.. he was mediocre.. Micheal Keaton was the best. but anyway, he wasn't serious enough, to laid back. there was no darkness about this movie, he made jokes through the whole thing.. and the bat Mobile.... gets worse every time. now on to robin ( Chris o Donnell) he was OK. not as many corny puns as batman but still pretty bad.. his role was much better in batman forever... and then there is bat girl, aside form her good looks.. still a bad performance. Poisin Ivy's role was done OK, there could have been improvements but it wasn't all that bad. and ill jump to Mr freeze. i think he did an excellent job, Arnold was the man for the role, tough guy attitude yet soft when it comes to his wife, will not stop in order to save her life.Over all i think they could have done a lot better if they actually thought about the turnout of this move. the darkness of batman in the first 2 of the series was great. this was 1 big cheese comedy to me. i don't recommend this to anyone!",Batman & Robin
976,DragonFurry,So corny is cool,8,31 January 2021,"Watching all the 4 Batman movies back to back. They get more and more silly. This one being very silly. Looking more like the old TV show then the others. Crossed with a MTV video. Every actor just seems to be having way to much fun.
The end fight on the streets, is like holiday on ice.
Watching the movie today is just fun.",Batman & Robin
977,suffocate_my_being,one star is too much,1,11 December 2005,"This movie was horrible. Hardly Worth the time and money...i wish it was possible to give it negative 10 stars.. this movie is so horrible it should subtract stars from other movies. i feel like an idiot having seen it. May god have mercy on the souls of who ever was involved in the making of the craptastic film. If you feel like throwing away a few dollars and and an 1hour and 20 minutes of your life i suggest you watch this film. Terrible acting, fake plastic sets, lame low frequency, single digit dialogs. Well nothing else to say. This is pretty much the worst movie ever made it does a disservice to man kind having been made.",Batman & Robin
978,Charlie_Sheen_Vs_Henry_R,This Movie Is TERRIBLE!,1,26 February 2006,"This movie is like a My Chemical Romance Music Video. It's just that Terrible and aganising to Watch or Listen to. This Movie Is Not Even Mediocre. it's just that bad. Don't believe me? The Director Joel Schumacher even had to APOLOGIZE on the Special Features. Bane is one of the most Intelligent Villains. Let me remind you that in the comic he found out the Identity of Batman and Broke his back in the Batcave, Leaving him crippled. In ""Batman And Robin"" he was nothing then a Retarded Ape who Moaned and set Icecube bombs around rooms. Mr. Freeze who is the most mis-casted actor played by Arnold Swarneggar is just hilarious. He's not Homicidal at all. he's a happy-go-lucky Body Builder who says nothing but hilarious Lines Like ""You're Not Putting ME In Da Collah!"" LOL WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? Poison Ivy just pranced around like a Slut (Excuse my launguage but there is no other words I can use to explain her actions in the movie). The Digital Effects were stupid and the actions the characters did was lame. I Mean Flying off into a rocket ship and then using the doors as Sky-Boards to Fly back to earth Safely. I Mean heck, I would of done the same thing in that Situation. and What about that Hockey Scene? Looked like the Freaking Ice Capades. Barbara Gordan has ALWAYS (Since the 60's) been Commissoner Gordan's Adopted daughter. They totally Changed that around and made her Alfred's Niece. prob because they tried everything as possible to Kill of Gordan's Character. All he did was yell ""go batman, Go!!!"" on top of Police Rooftops. Batman Was Complete With Nipples and A Giant Cod-Piece Which was not very Appropriate. This movie deserves to be in the bottom 300. Go See Batman Begins. It's an amazing movie",Batman & Robin
979,junoboy-47177,for the glorious movie critics!,10,11 February 2019,"Give it a break! This movie isn't bad. You were just expecting too much! This is not Les Miserable people! It's supposed to be comical. It's a childhood character, so don't put your adulting to it!",Batman & Robin
980,acexoxo,Worst movie of the Batman franchise!,1,25 August 2018,Recently I had made it my mission to watch all of the Batman movies just under 5 days and I've come to the conclusion that this is most definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Literally 5 minutes into this movie and I knew it was going to turn out awful. I hate that I had endure watching the rest so that I can say that I watched them all. The plot of this movie was completely irritating to watch. It was just a very bad plot line and the only thing that kept me going in this movie was watching Alfred. I missed Keaton when watching this. Clooney is definitely not the best Batman out there. He's Definitely at the very bottom of the list of celebrities that have played Batman. He just wasn't that entertaining and sadly Robin was more exciting than him.,Batman & Robin
981,michaeltbrowncomets,Peasants and fools listen close.,10,9 October 2018,"You truly do not understand the subtle and beautiful cinematography that accompanies a truly thought provoking script lifelike dialogue and amazing acting.How could you miss the inlaid moral message hidden in this master piece. Like Mr. Freeze we all grapple with a need to freeze the world. Keep it contained in our own personal snow globes. Not to mention the obvious gay subplot between batman and robin. Why else would they cast someone so old in the titular boy wonder role. Each interaction between them was so steamy i popped a rock hard boner every time they were on screen. My only complaint is that they spent to much time on introducing this bat girl and trying to turn robin into something other then the gay icon he was meant to be. very poor choice. Also if you don't agree with anything here you have to agree, if it has a Schwarzenegger its a ten. come on now.",Batman & Robin
982,Drachen77,"Yes, it really is THAT bad",1,2 April 2006,"OK, so by now you have read numerous reviews that state this is one of the worst movies ever made. Well, believe them all. This movie is absolutely horrible. I have never seen a movie that does everything so bad: acting, dialog, story, sets, soundtrack, and special effects. One major problem the movie has is that is has too many characters. Three good guys, three bad guys, and then supporting characters like Bruce's girlfriend and Alfred. The stories get so tied up in knots you can't even figure them out. The dialog is really only one-liners and puns put together to create a ""conversation"". Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl is the worst character ever put on film. She can't act and delivers the worst line in movie history; ""Suit me up, Uncle Alfred"". I almost choked on my popcorn it was so stupid. I love Arnold, but holy crap is he worthless in this movie. Don't get me started on Poison Ivy or Robin, talk about a waste of space. And then there is Bane, one of the most important characters ever in a storyline turned into a bumbling idiot. Mr.Freeze and Poison Ivy dying were the two best parts of the movie, since we knew it would be over soon. I still can't believe that someone actually thought this was a good idea.",Batman & Robin
