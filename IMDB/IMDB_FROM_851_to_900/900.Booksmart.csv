0,SnoopyStyle,love the friendship,8,30 June 2019,"It's the last day of high school. Molly (Beanie Feldstein) is an academic over-achiever and obsessive class president. She is proud of getting into Yale and her gay best friend Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) is going to Africa. Molly is horrified to learn others who she sees as slackers are also headed to exciting opportunities. She fears that they have sacrificed socializing for nothing and vows to have one night of partying.This is a very good coming-of-age high school comedy. I love the girls' friendship. There are a few minor instances where I want improvements. There is one moment when I realized that Molly is not nice. On the yacht, she tells Jared that he can't buy friends. At that moment, she should invite him to join them. Her character needs an act of kindness. Otherwise, Beanie should learn from her brother and get run over by a car. She had done it herself. If the character isn't that likeable, we should at least laugh at her. Amy is likeable enough for both of them. Molly should be the clown. As it stands, the duo is great but it could be marginally better.The best scene is the swimming pool. I feared that it would turn out that way and the shock of that moment still hurts. It's a great scene. Both Beanie and Kaitlyn are great and deliver a real friendship on the screen. This has a few solid laughs. It's an amazing directing debut for Olivia Wilde. She has some very good cinematic moves. It's also part of the job to deliver what seems like a happy and fun group. It translates onto the screen. This is fun.",Booksmart
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Struggles at the (more meaningful) center of the story, but surely has its fun moments otherwise",6,23 July 2020,"""Booksmart"" is an American comedy film from 2019 that runs for 100 minutes approximately. Here in Germany, this premiered back in November 2019, so between half a year and a year now, which makes it still a relatively new movie and they were showing it one more (maybe final) time today at the open air cinema. I missed it back then, but my curiosity rose when I saw it got a BAFTA and Golden Globe nomination and I decided to give it a go this time. I don't really regret it. It is alright. By the way, the director is Olivia Wilde and this was her first full feature as the woman in charge behind the camera. She directed other stuff before, short films and, unexpectedly, a RHCP music video, one of my favorite bands. Gotta check that one out. And Wilde is of course a prolific actress herself. Saw her in quite a few things, ""House M.D."" obviously, which was her breakthrough, but also stuff like ""Rush"" and, very recently, Clint Eastwood's new film ""Richard Jewell"". I am just mentioning her a bit more than usual because there were talks about her potentially getting a Director nomination at the Oscars, mostly because she is a female and there is a lot of talk about gender discrimination and so on, but she came short, which is accurate because this film we have here is merely a decent, but not a great directorial achievement. She is still among the rising younger female directors these days, a group probably led by Greta Gerwig, who I like as well, but her Oscar-nominated directing effort was also not too amazing and I am glad she did not get in a second time even and I say this as somebody who quite likes her as an actress. Anyway, I am drifting away now. Back to Wilde's effort we have here. There is a massive amount of four writers credited and all of them are females too. Not a coincidence. This is a very female-centered movie and the quartet managed a BAFTA nomination for their work. Surprises me a bit that Wilde was not part of this writing team. Also, as you can see on the poster here on imdb, the two protagonists are females as well. Beanie Feldstein is the one on the right and she played definitely the showier (and for me less likable) character from the two and this may be the reason why she scored the Golden Globe nomination. I think Dever (the one on the left) would not have been less deserving of a nod. It's alright though. I will be curious to see which directions the duo's careers will be heading. I have a feeling Dever will do better in the long run and Feldstein will perhaps struggle a bit with the challenge to prove that she is not just a dark-haired Rebel Wilson. Time will tell.Now I was worried early on about this movie when they immediately shoved Hillary and RBG in our faces and not much later Warren as well (how's her 2020 campaign going?) that this could be a feminist movie without fun and good narration and plot twists, but luckily they did all this at the beginning and it gets better soon. One thing I liked is that Dever's character's homosexuality is never an issue at all. Very realistic. People are really fine with it, also the parents, or just do not care at all. No need to turn this into a big dramatic emotional coming-out tale. The only reason we really find out about it is because we know right away who she is crushing on and that it is a girl, even one with a pretty male-sounding first name. This is still what they did right, the attraction part. However, as for the romance, they really messed up everything else afterwards and this is what I am implying with the title of my review. Be it the lesbian girl all of a sudden entering into sex, maybe a relationship even, with somebody completely different was as ridiculous as Feldstein's character kissing the other guy at the parade at the end. It was already bad enough how they told us who she is interested in initially. I mean I can deal with the fact that it was the jock, but how she admits after another character randomly says so is pretty embarrassing. How would she not have told her friend before? They seem to talk about literally everything. I mean the part with the lesbian staying abroad for a year and not a month is already difficult to believe that it is a secret, but who Feldstein's character is crushing on being a secret is just impossible to believe. Or that both of their crushes eventually start making out in the swimming pool. With each other!? That is my only big criticism here though or maybe that it does not feel too realistic that we are supposed to believe these two main characters have never been at parties etc. how they are doing, how they are immediately the center of attention and so on also feels a bit difficult to believe and not too authentic. So every time the movie got a bit more serious (also the argument between the girls towards the end had a little pseudo drama to it), it is not doing well, also the part about the other girl being discriminated against with her nickname, but apparently the writers realized that quickly themselves and kept it light again wwhen she admits yeah it is true. It is doing well though whenever nothing but comedy is involved, be it panda abuse, be it Forte and Kudrow (who are both great as always despite very limited screen time), be it Sudeikis' character, especially in the car when he changes the tapes, this film is very funny on several occasions. There is no way I can name them all when I laughed here. It put a smile on my lips so many times. Okay, the gross moments like the sex scene at the end and the wrong hole and fateful drink were not exactly a success, but I can see why others like it. For example, the girl next to me laughed on completely different occasions than myself, but we both laughed, so you will definitely not find everything funny that I found funny, but you will find enough funny for sure. Like one example could be that this is a comedy that, like so many others, delivers through absurdity and going over the top, simply delivering something really unexpected. This description applies pretty well to the two other parties where the girls end up before finding the one they are actually looking for or of course the extended doll sequence that even allowed them to go for a lengthy nudity sequence. That was a truly unexpected moment of animation that was in fact drug-induced, so maybe not that funny if we are strict. I thought it peaked early already when we see the animated arms and nothing else. All afterwards was alright, but not necessary. Okay here and there it was all a bit unrealistic like at the end when they find out about the criminal from the Wanted! poster or also how their principal is driving the car (okay I forgive them that because, like I said, the tape thingey was so hilariously awkward), but the film is charming enough to make it easy to forgive them for these flaws. I think the pretty massive awards recognition (without Oscar nominations though) is not undeserving, but slightly exaggerated all in all. Still, there is definitely some talent involved and I am especially curious about what Wilde will be coming up with next. A pretty good start for her, even better than how some greats have launched their careers. ""Booksmart"" deserves to be seen and also certainly not only by females, but guys can check this one out. Also really good use of music here, some catchy songs included that I have not yet come across. Go watch this one. Certainly among the better comedies of 2019. Thumbs up!",Booksmart
2,nogodnomasters,We are smart and fun,8,18 December 2019,Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) are two smart girls who never partied in high school to make sure they get into a great college. They discover on the last day of school that the kids who goofed off are also going to the same colleges. Molly decides that they are going to go to Nick's party. Molly has a crush on Nick while Amy has a crush on Ryan (Victoria Ruesga) who is going to be there.The first hour of the film is the girl's attempting to figure out where the party is being held. The party was subdued compared to other teen parties in the cinema. The film was humorous with one smile scene after another.Guide: F-word. Sex? No nudity.,Booksmart
3,kosmasp,Olivia Wild(e) at it,8,11 November 2021,"There is a case to be made, that this woman has quite the mind of her own. And quite an imaginitive one too. While this is aimed more at a female (and younger audience), it is fun to watch for everyone and may help some understand some of the trials and tribulations especially girls and young woman go through. Even more so if they are (book)smart.Of course we hope things will change and they are changing. While we have different things we yearn for (some gender specific or non gender specific I reckon) and while we keep learning more and more about us as a species, there is always the goal to keep getting better at helping each other out.But do not fret and don't think this is a movie that is here to be educational and informative - this is does lay between the lines. The overall premise of the movie is the young girls who are growing up and learning things - which we experience with them through a lot of comedy. Weird comedy, but really good one.",Booksmart
4,jboothmillard,Booksmart,6,23 June 2019,"I saw the trailer for this film twice at the cinema, and then I heard about the comparisons by critics and cinemagoers, saying it was like a ""female Superbad"", I was up for giving it a go and hoping for a good laugh, the directorial debut of House actress Olivia Wilde. Basically Molly Davidson (Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill's sister) and Amy Antsler (Kaitlyn Dever) have been best friends since childhood, but are considered more interested in studying and less on having fun by fellow high school students. Amy came out as gay two years ago, and had a crush on Ryan (Victoria Ruesga), Molly urges her to attempt to forge a relationship before they graduate. The day before graduation, Molly overhears fellow students talking about her and Amy in the bathroom. She tells them that they have got into good schools through studying hard, but despite partying and seemingly not caring about studies, the students have also secured places into good colleges. Molly angrily tells Amy that they have missed out on four years of fun working to get good grades, Amy reluctantly agrees to join her in going to an end-of-year party hosted by Nick Howland (Mason Gooding). The pair of them realise however, they have no idea where the party is being held. Molly calls kind-hearted and wealthy classmate Jared (Skyler Gisondo) for help, but he instead brings them to his yacht for his own party. No other guests have turned up, apart from his drug-crazed friend Gigi (Billie Lourd), they stay for a few minutes before leaving. Amy suggests they go home, having fulfilled their plan to party before graduation, but Molly calls ""Malala"", their code for unconditionally doing what the other wants to do, and Amy consents to continue with the night. The girls call a Lyft taxi and are shocked to be picked up by Principal Jordan Brown (Jason Sudeikis). After accidentally playing the sound of pornography through the car speakers, Brown drops them off at the house of classmate George (Noah Galvin), but it's a murder mystery party. The two encounter Gigi again, who reveals that the food that they ate on the yacht was drugged, and both Amy and Molly soon experience a bad trip and hallucinate that they are dolls. They escape the house and get the location of the party from Pat the Pizza Guy (Mike O'Brien). Amy accidentally leaves her phone in his car, and Molly's phone is nearly dead, lasting just long enough to call for help from someone she can rely on. Soon enough, their teacher and friend Miss Fine (Jessica Williams) arrives, gives them a change of clothes and drives them to Nick's party. When they arrive, Amy goes to talk to Ryan and Molly goes to talk to Nick, who she has a crush on. Amy is embarrassed however when after talking to Ryan, she sees her kissing Nick, she wants to leave, and calls her own ""Malala"", but Molly refuses to do so, thinking she has a chance with Nick. In rage, Amy reveals that she plans to take a gap year and travel to Botswana, and she resents how Molly always tries to take control of her life. They loudly argue in front of their classmates, until Amy goes to bathroom and has a panic attack. She is found by Hope (Ma's Diana Silvers), whom other students find cruel. They squabble at first, but then Amy kisses Hope, they almost have sex, until Amy vomits on her and ruins the moment. Molly is driven home by Annabelle ""Triple A"" (Molly Gordon), a popular student with a reputation for promiscuity, and they bond over being stereotyped. The next morning, graduation day, Molly wakes up feeling ashamed of what happened between her and Amy. She sees on her phone that everyone is talking about how cool Amy was for distracting police officers when they came to shut down Nick's party. Molly visits Amy in jail to apologise for her actions, and they reconcile. The two see a wanted poster, and recognise the pizza driver fro the night before, he is a serial killer, they trade their information to get Amy out of jail. They drive to the graduation where Molly improvises a farewell speech and kisses Jared, receiving a round of applause. A few days later, Molly helps Amy prepare for her trip to Botswana, and Hope comes to the house to give Amy her number. Molly drives Amy to the airport and they share a tearful goodbye, but Amy jumps in the car before Molly leaves, saying she has time to hang out before her flight, so they go to get pancakes. Also starring Lisa Kudrow as Charmaine Antsler, Amy's mom, Will Forte as Doug Antsler, Amy's dad, Eduardo Franco as Theo, Austin Crute as Alan, and the voice of Maya Rudolph as the Motivational Voice. Feldstein and Dever are very talented young actresses, making a terrific double act as the straight-A students who want to go all out, it is a nice simple story, good girls gone bad and taking a walk on the wild side, partying before they graduate, it has a great sharp-tongued script and splendid characters, leading and supporting, it does make you laugh at the right moments, and it is visually entertaining as well, including the animated sequence, all in all it is an enjoyable coming-of-age comedy. Good!",Booksmart
5,BandSAboutMovies,Completely hilarious,8,7 June 2019,"Olivia Wilde makes her directorial debut with this coming of age comedy with a script from Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel, and Katie Silberman. It follows a very simple concept: What if two girls who've been friends for life realized that they did high school all wrong? What if everyone that they looked down on because all they did was party and waste their high-school years also made it into Ivy League schools?Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein (who has shined in Neighbors 2, Ladybird and the TV version of What We Do In the Shadows) were cast as the two leads, living together as roommates for ten weeks so that they could build the relationship necessary to make their relationship feel authentic. If Feldstein feels familiar, her brother is Jonah Hill, which makes sense, as many have pegged this movie as a female empowered Superbad. Trust us - it can stand on its own.Amy and Molly (Dever and Feldstein) are considered pretentious by their hard-partying high school peers and even their principal (Jason Sudeikis, Wilde's husband who turns in a great performance as always). And even though Molly came out to her parents two years ago - Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte in a deft cameo that he has some hints of pathos - she hasn't dated a girl yet.The day before they graduate, Molly learns the truth: every single one of the students they've avoided has done just as well - or better - than them when it comes to college placement. They decide to make their last night together before Amy goes to do volunteer work in Africa one to remember. Hijinks, as they say, ensue.The true beauty of Booksmart is that it combines realistic warmth with over the top bawdy humor. It also has characters that are multilayered and defy easy characterization. Jared may be a vapid rich kid, but he wants to be so much more. Gigi (Billie Lourd, the daughter of Carrier Fisher) may live for drugs, but she can also see into peoples' hearts. Even Annabelle, who has been set up as the villain of the story, ends up being a friend to the girls when they really need it. And Mike O'Brien, the creator of the now-canceled A.P. Bio and a former Saturday Night Live cast member, has an awesome small part as a pizza guy caught up in the machinations of our heroines.The music is non-stop and punctuates so much of the film and is put together by the legendary Dan the Automator, who produced Dr. Octagon and the Gorillaz. It's perfect for the film.Booksmart pulls off what I believed impossible: a bawdy, belligerent and yet intelligent and endearing teen comedy somehow made in a year where things get censored by the very young people who should be pushing the envelope.",Booksmart
6,george.schmidt,"More than a 'female SUPERBAD' -the dynamic duo of Dever & Feldstein make this one of the best films, comedies and films about teens of the year (or any year).",10,1 July 2019,"BOOKSMART (2019) **** Kaitlyn Dever, Beanie Feldstein, Jessica Williams, Jason Sudeikis, Lisa Kudrow, Will Forte, Victoria Ruesga, Mason Gooding, Skyler Gisondo, Diana Silvers, Molly Gordon, Billie Lourd, Eduardo Franco, Nico Hirago, Austin Crute, Noah Galvin, Michael Patrick O' Brien, (voice of Maya Rudolph) Hilarious last-day-of-high-school comedy with the dynamic duo of Dever & Feldstein (channeling their inner Joan Cusack and Melissa McCarthy, respectively) as besties who realize at the last minute they have not had a fun time as teens and decide to make one final stab at a classmate's epic party on the eve of graduation. Funny, whip-smart and a great ensemble (Lourd's 'bad penny' of a friend is hysterical recalling Natasha Lyonne) help fuel the shrewd screenplay by Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel & Katie Silberman that echoes John Hughes, Judd Apatow and Cameron Crowe while actress Olivia Wilde makes a humdinger directorial debut wisely allowing her talent cast to get their ya-yas out and revealing her inner Amy Heckerling, to boot. One of the best films, comedies and films about teens of the year (or any year).",Booksmart
7,neil-476,Rather likeable,8,30 May 2019,"Molly and Amy are on the eve of graduation from high school. Molly is an aggressive smart-*rse, Amy is rather gentler. Amy came out 2 years ago, but both girls have been so tied up with studying that dating, partying, sexual exploration and the like hasn't had a look in. But, on discovering that their partying contemporaries have also all secured Ivy League university places, the two friends determine to party the night away.This film has been compared to Superbad. I see the resemblance, but I quite liked this movie whereas, for me, Jonah Hill's character stank Superbad up so badly that I couldn't bear it. It is ironic, then, that Molly is played by an actress going under the name Beanie Feldstein, who turns out to be Jonah Hill's sister.I really have no idea how accurate a depiction of high school graduation in the USA this is, but as a raunchy teen comedy it wasn't bad. The raunchy bits managed to be funny rather than just sleazy as is so often the case, and the characters were mostly nicely conceived and realised.I particularly enjoyed Amy's journey. Her coming out, while significant, has turned out to be unremarkable and now she finally seeks to see how things go, with mixed results. Sensitive, funny, touching.I found this rather likeable.",Booksmart
8,evanston_dad,Wasn't Funny,5,23 July 2019,"A raunchy comedy about the coming of age of two young women? Sounds great! A buddy movie directed by and starring females? Just what we need! A movie from the point of view of anyone other than a straight white man? Sign me up!So why do I give ""Booksmart"" such a low rating? Because it's not funny. It thinks it's funny, and it tries awfully hard to be so. But it's just not. There are moments here and there that made me chuckle, but for the most part this movie was like watching ""Saturday Night Live"" when the first really good opening skit is over and you still have an hour of show left -- a series of sketches, some funnier than others, but all of which go on too long and aggressively milk a one-note joke for all it's worth.And this movie had a great premise. And it had two appealing actresses in the lead, both of which show promise of having comic ability. But it just falls flat on its face one too many times.I have to believe that the only reason critics have been so kind to this film is that it was directed by Olivia Wilde and gives us a story about girls in a cultural moment when people are clamoring for more movies by women and about female characters. But even movies made by women still have to be good.Grade: C+",Booksmart
9,ferguson-6,Olivia Wilde at the helm,7,23 May 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every generation tends to get the high school movie (the movie about high school life) they deserve. Going back to James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955) and Sidney Poitier in TO SIR WITH LOVE (1967), what followed were such memorable films as CARRIE (1976), GREASE (1978), FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982), most every John Hughes movie from the 80's, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986), SAY ANYTHING (1989), DAZED AND CONFUSED (1993), CLUELESS (1995), 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (1999), MEAN GIRLS (2004), HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL (2006), JUNO (2007), and SUPERBAD (2007). It's that last one on the list that this directorial debut from Olivia Wilde is likely to draw the most comparisons to.Kaitlyn Dever (""Justified"") and Beanie Feldstein (LADY BIRD, and sister of Jonah Hill) star as Amy and Molly, two best friends and high school seniors who have sacrificed a social life (i.e. partying) for academics in order to position themselves for the best colleges. Amy has decided to take a gap year doing charity work in Botswana, while Molly wears her intelligence and class ranking on her sleeve and sits in judgement of her less disciplined classmates. She is headed to Yale with her ultimate life goal being an appointment to the Supreme Court (she has an RBG poster up in her room).Imagine their shock when, the day before graduation, Amy and Molly discover that many of their less-disciplined (i.e. hard partying) classmates will also be attending elite schools. The besties immediately scheme to make up for 4 years of nose-to-the-grindstone by attending the biggest party of the year ... and showing others how much fun they can be. Plus, the party affords each the opportunity to pursue their crush: skater-girl Ryan (Victoria Ruesga) for Amy, and athlete Nick (Mason Gooding) for Molly.Although (full disclosure) I was never a high school girl, the one thing that stands out about the film is how the kids seem like real kids. That's not to say most every aspect isn't slightly exaggerated, because it is. The level of gayness in the Drama club is a bit difficult to take, and the teenage body is objectified in more than one shot; however, director Wilde has a knack for making high school look cinematic. Two sequences are particular standouts for the way they are filmed: the swimming pool scene with Amy underwater, and the house party as the characters weave in and out of rooms in the large house
Supporting roles add depth to the comedy thanks to Jason Sudeikis as the school Principal/Lyft driver; Billie Lourd (daughter of Carrie Fisher) as Gigi, who is always popping up and stealing scenes; Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte as Amy's parents; Molly Gordon (""Animal Kingdom"") as the misunderstood 'Triple A'; the aforementioned Victoria Ruesga and Mason Gooding; and star-in-the-making Diana Silvers as Hope - the aptly named rebel who clicks with Amy.Co-written by Susanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, and Katie Silberman, the film presents a realistic friendship between two teenage girls, and mines some common and recognizable personalities for comedy gold. Smart and funny female characters are interesting at any age, and ""no one knows me"" is the anthem of most every high school student since caveman days. The inevitable comparisons to SUPERBAD will likely be favorable to this film, and it will probably be the perfect fit for this generation - even if we hope most students avoid many of the happenings. With Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers, you should prepare for the harsh language high school kids are known for, as well as that 'brazen, yet insecure' blend so common to the age. Of course, we can't help but find the timing of release quite interesting, given the recent college admissions scandal. It won't replace AMERICAN GRAFFITI for me, but with Olivia Wilde having been known as an actress, we now recognize her as a legitimate director.",Booksmart
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Gets an A, even if it doesn't give an F.",8,27 May 2019,"'Booksmart (2019)' is a coming-of-age comedy that, essentially, tells us not to judge a book by its cover, that no-one is better than anyone else and that you should try to enjoy life while you can. Like so many in the genre, it also focuses on a strong central friendship. The difference is that, here, it's a sisterhood - something sadly not seen too often in cinema, let alone comedy. That sisterhood is palpably rendered by its two leads, who are both incredibly likeable - and nuanced - in their roles. When it comes down to it, the film feels like the sort of 'R-rated' teen-comedy they don't really make any more pushed firmly into modern day; it's progressive in pretty much every aspect. It's also consistently entertaining. There's never a dull moment, as it somehow crams everything it wants to achieve into its slim frame. Indeed, the jokes come fast and they come funny. It's laugh-out-loud, at times, and should keep you chuckling throughout. Even when you're not, you'll probably be smiling. That's because it's just charming. The characters and world feel rounded and realistic but also ever-so-slightly heightened and absurdist. Practically everyone on-screen seems like a 'real' person - or, at least, one fully grounded within the feature. It's relatable, honest and, even, heartfelt. It's trying to say several things and it ends up saying most of them rather well. It's always enjoyable, too. It's probably one of the best examples of its genre. 8/10",Booksmart
11,ThomasDrufke,The Surprise of the Summer,9,8 May 2019,"It's not often I get to see movies early, but when I got the opportunity to see 'Booksmart' a few weeks before its release (being that the trailers were fantastic), I knew I had to jump at the chance. If it wasn't already obvious, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein have impeccable chemistry, and always fill the screen with just the right amount of energy and heart, in what could be considered one of the best high school films of the last 15 years. Combining realistic drama with laugh-loud gut busting humor, 'Booksmart' (if marketed correctly) could be the surprise film of the summer. It felt like just the right combination of The Spectacular Now meets Superbad. And believe me, both of those tones work wonder for this movie.9.5/10",Booksmart

At times it felt like it was trying awfully hard with all of its wokeness, which I suppose makes it a product of its time, but at its center are some timeless themes, such as dealing with the cliques in high school, having close friends that help you survive it, and the inevitable transition after graduation.

13,Cineanalyst,A Not-So-Smart Party Movie,6,11 October 2019,"Smart girl learns important lesson that she's not better than her middle-to-upper class peers; she's better than the rest of us.Regardless of the rave reviews from critics, I didn't expect much from a movie that was celebrated as a progressive gender-reversal of ""Superbad"" (2007) for a new generation. And, it's largely just that. I didn't care much for ""Superbad,"" however, nor much of the stuff Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg do. Sure, it was funny in parts, but ultimately vacuous. Ditto the crude humor mixed with sweetness formula also employed for ""Booksmart."" It's another one-night teen party movie starring twenty-somethings--you know, because, apparently, it's a good idea to have some sex appeal in your movie about high-school seniors. The leads let loose for a change, get into some high jinks, quarrel briefly, embrace the bittersweetness of their looking forward to the next stage of their lives and, of course, learn some lessons along the way, such as the one in the paragraph above.I think it's the coming-of-age party formula that's the problem, not the generation and certainly not the reflecting back the values and experiences of the spectator, as much as some viewers seem to care about that sort of thing. I don't know whom you have to be born to get into a high school where half the student body of underdeveloped stereotypes is accepted to the Ivy League or is otherwise going to attend a prestigious university or go work for Google. Molly's home situation is conspicuously underdeveloped, but for those who aren't, they come from wealthy families. In one scene, Molly naively exclaims that, ""You can't buy people's affection."" Jared, correctly, replies, ""No, I'm pretty sure you can, because I've seen it a lot. My parents did it. Their parents did it."" But, it's not as though ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993) is any better because of its seemingly-more-realistic aimlessness and lower-class characters. And, just so it's clear that I'm offending every generation growing up on teen films: John Hughes is overrated, too.At least, ""Booksmart"" is well made--a promising start for director Olivia Wilde. There's a bit of amusing blending of fantasy sequences, which are largely drug induced. The score effectively moves things along. I especially liked the underwater pool photography and its musical accompaniment. The acting is good, too, including some comedy veterans for the adult parts. Kaitlyn Dever is especially impactful in her dramatic character arc even though it's a clichéd awkward sexual adventure. If you're wondering whether the main characters all find a romantic coupling by the end, or whether friendships are mended, then you've clearly not seen many of these movies. ""Booksmart"" is more of the same, and there's nothing particularly smart about that.",Booksmart
14,atlasmb,A Solid Teen Comedy,7,17 January 2020,"Booksmart 7 stars 2019 1/17/2020I decided to watch this film after hearing some very positive buzz. Over the years, I have been a fan of comedies that provide a witty and insightful view into the lives of teens. Films like ""Ferris Bueller"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""The Breakfast Club"". Thanks, John Hughes.""Booksmart"" is about two high school senior girls who decide to break out of their staid and predictable shells on the day before graduation.Molly is a walking cliché. Her bedroom walls are a shrine to her progressive heroes, like Michelle Obama and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. She has her future mapped out: Yale, a brilliant career in law, a seat on the Supreme Court. She listens to affirmation tapes that reinforce her superior self-view and encourage absolute destruction of any opposition. When she goes to the unisex bathroom in school, she corrects the grammar of the graffiti written there. She is class president, valedictorian, and teacher's pet.Amy is basically Molly's minion, though Molly pretends they are equals. Amy is gay and out there, but unassertive, though she buys into Molly's plans for the future. Or does she?Over the course of a night, the girls go on a quest, seeking to redefine their existence. Many films have used that same premise. One may see ""Booksmart"" as derivative, but it forges its own path.Where ""Clueless"" had a heroine who voiced Valleyspeak and ""Legally Blonde"" had Elle, who spouted the somewhat vacuous assertions of the Cosmo-inspired woman, Molly and Amy are primed with the woke, self-referential jargon of the progressive left.The two characters are quite likable in their nerdy quirkiness. We can relate to their naivete in matters outside their narrow life experience. During the night, they run into a variety of wacky characters and learn some things about humility and acceptance (much like ""The Breakfast Club"").The night is triggered by a realization that their entire high school experience was dedicated to the accomplishment of goal-driven objectives while others were enjoying a broader experience and still were accepted into solid college programs. When the industrious ants discovered that the lazy grasshoppers were just as well off, they decided to ""change our stories forever.""The storyline is so densely filled with cultural references that a second viewing is worthwhile. There are some plot holes, but they are minor. And the plot is not totally predictable, keeping it interesting.The acting is solid and features some older comedy stalwarts, like Jason Sudeikis (husband of Olivia Wilde who is making her feature film directorial debut) and Lisa Kudrow. The cast of younger actors includes a few who promise to become stars.If you like the young adult comedy genre, this film is worth a look.",Booksmart

16,ops-52535,ive come to the realisation,5,26 May 2019,"That im too old for these neomodern highschool comedydramas. in this case its wasnt overuse of social media etc, no , its the way the humour funk'æs today. when i grew up it was a good bunch of slapstick humour, and especially i loved comedies where the buildup to funny act could be smelled 3 seconds before it appeared on the screen, me ending up in a bundle at the floor between the seats of the cinema theater near dead by asphycsiation from pure and divine laughter. where have they all gone?yes its the art of verbal epoglytal humour that dominates this comedy, and it comes in such cascades, you might think the hoover dam has cracked open, or they went empty of tobacco and did the weed bare with ice at the end. its just to much for me,english isnt my motherlanguage, so when they drive the alphabetical carousell at the pace they do in this flick, i get grumpy and think they are nerds. ive got a booksmart friend by the way, not so schoolsmart but able to read all 3 books in the tolkien series, the lord of the ring in 12 hours, and that was the english version!!!!! why do i mention him...well he loves these kind of films, and the more he can phrase them the better. that is nerdy, but hes still my best friend.i know im old and grumpy, but smiled a couple of times, and found beanie feldstein super cute it was not so funny for me, it might be fun for you i just wanda how many hours that day they tried to manage all this had?!",Booksmart

Olivia Wilde did an excellent job of directing a new generation high school gem, she's a wonderful actress too, it's cool she's trying something different, and I hope more flourishes from her work!Booksmart is very crude definitely not for some crowds, to whom don't mind it it's a lovely flick about genuine comradery of 2 best friends that just wanna party before they have to grow up.

18,cruise01,One of the best comedies of the year.,10,5 September 2019,"Booksmart (5 out of 5 stars).Booksmart is a great coming of age comedy film that delivers with Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein performance. This might as well be the teenage girl version of Superbad. The plot focusing on these two girls who never broke a rule in high school. And finally graduating. When they realize, a lot of cool kids who got into trouble, partied hard, and who which they thought wouldn't succeed. Are making it into big colleges which they tried so hard to do with focusing in school. They decide to find one of the cool kids parties on the final day of school.It is a great coming of age story. Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) is a lesbian. Her family is easily accepting who she is. But she is afraid to express her feelings towards her crush. Molly (Beanie Feldstein) the school's president and trying to express how she feels towards this one popular kid.The film is straight out hilarious. Olivia Wilde's direction is fast, funny, and it kept the energy in tone so high with humor. It never slows down for a boring dramatic moment. The humor can be stupid, and it stayed focusing on the characters coming of age story. It can be relatable to teenagers. The characters are all fun. Jason Sudeikis playing the principle was hilarious and the girls run into him as he is their lyft driver. Jared (Skyler Gisondo) is a kid who is trying to seek attention but everyone assumes different of him. He is hilarious and great at what he does with his roles.Overall, Booksmart is a great film. One of the best comedies of the year. The performances are great. The script, direction, and story is touching and fun.",Booksmart
19,eddie_baggins,One of 2019's best comedies,8,12 September 2019,"Tackling the high school comedy in a way that's usually reserved for the boys of the world like Superbad, actress Olivia Wilde has excitedly and lovingly crafted her ode to growing up and school based shenanigans with the year's most likable and fresh comedy Booksmart.Showcasing that the girls can in fact be just as crazy, crass and enjoyable as the boys, Booksmart is like a breath of fresh air for the female-centric comedy, one that while struggling unfairly to make a massive splash at the box office this year (meaning it was sadly hard to track down in the cinema here in Australia) will likely be a cult favourite for years yet to come thanks to Wilde's energetic direction and the chemistry of its two leads Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein.Naturally charismatic and gifted performers, Dever's straight edged Amy and Feldstein's academic driven Molly make for one of the year's best pair-ups and bring a verve and enthusiasm to Booksmart that is undeniably impressive and as the two pent-up work focussed best friends finally let loose on the night before their high school graduation, Booksmart takes us on an over the top but also relatable trip to the final days of care free living as adult lives begin to become the aim of the game.Similar to such films as the aforementioned Superbad and classic last day of school based romp Dazed and Confused, Booksmart sets its story up over literally the last days in our protagonists high school lives but thanks to the work of Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel and Katie Silberman perfectly in-tune script that mixes belly laughs with genuinely touching moments of humanity and heart, each one of the characters that come in and play a part of Amy and Molly's wild night feel lived in and full of life and spark.There's no question that this is the Dever and Feldstein show but Booksmart's winning ensemble that includes bit parts from recognisable faces such as Lisa Kudrow, Will Forte and Jason Sudeikis and great career building turns from the likes of Skyler Gisondo, Diana Silvers and Billie Lourd ensures that Wilde's film is filled to the brim with talent and enthusiasm that can only come from a film that that quite clearly provided the environment for creativity and spark to be formed around the basis for what could've been ""just another"" teen based comedy touching on themes that have been explored ad nauseam since the dawn of cinema.Thankfully nothing in Booksmart feels copied or stale and while it's over the top central premise and happenings may not always ring true, Wilde and her team have managed the impossible in today's climate and managed to create something that feels, new and unexplored and in the modern age of increased female-centric features, Booksmart stands out from the crowd as a natural and well deservingly praised outing that just so happens to be side splittingly funny on more than a few occasions.Final Say -Joyously bought to life by Wilde and her lead duo of Dever and Feldstein, Booksmart is a wickedly fun night out on the town and one of the best recent examples of a female led comedy that puts many of its more phony counterparts to shame.4 plush Panda's out of 5",Booksmart

22,paul-allaer,Impressive debut from first-time director Olivia Wilde,8,27 May 2019,"""Booksmart"" (2019 release; 102 min.) brings the story of Amy and Molly. As the movie opens, Molly is meditating in her bedroom (adorned with Michelle Obama's book, a picture of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, etc., you get the idea), before she is picked up by her BFF Amy. It's the very last day before HS graduation, and straight A students Amy (admitted to Yale) and Molly (admitted to Columbia) have made it! But when Molly learns that the party-goers and ""losers"" are also admitted to elite colleges, Molly realizes that they have missed out on so much, and she talks Amy into going to a party and make up for list time... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of actress Olivia Wilde, and what a debut this is! Working from a script co-written by 4 women, Wilde brings a(nother) coming-of-age tale with a decidedly female perspective. Protagonists Molly and Amy are played with fervor by Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever (the new Ellen Page), and their on-screen chemistry benefits the movie significantly. The script is crisp, funny and yes, very raunchy so if that is not your thing, you may want to stay away from this. I thought it all blended together superbly, and so did the rest of the audience, with lots of loud-out laughing and hollering throughout the movie. ""Booksmart"" reminds me in spirit of last year's ""Eighth Grade"", which also brought a fresh perspective on the coming-of-age theme. With this film Wilde has immediately established herself as a director who needs to be reckoned with. I can't wait to see what she will tackle next.""Booksmart"" premiered at this year's SXSW festival to universal acclaim, and it opened wide this Memorial Day weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was a near sell-out, and the audience clearly enjoyed this movie a lot. If you are in the mood for a coming-of-age film with a fresh (female) perspective, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Booksmart
23,jtindahouse,One of 2019's best so far,9,23 June 2019,"If you can see the trailer for 'Booksmart' and not immediately picture a female version of 'Superbad' then you are a stronger person than I am. Even though that film isn't listed as an influence on this film, it had to be in some way. And there's nothing wrong with that. 'Superbad' was a terrific film, and so is this.To be watchable a film has to be over-the-top and unrealistic. It's that simple. No one wants to watch things that they likely see in their everyday life, because there's nothing cinematic or grand about that. 'Booksmart' finds an excellent balance between being completely over-the-top (in a really fun to watch way) and still somehow staying grounded and relatable. There are some low-key heart-breaking moments in this film amongst all the chaos. Also the amount of nostalgia is brought out in me was insane.The two lead actresses are particularly fantastic, but it has to be said the entire cast is tremendous as well. There isn't an unlikable character in this movie (even the ones that are meant to be unlikeable are somehow not so). This a movie I didn't want to end. I could watch this cast and this story go on for days on end. There is also a huge rewatch factor about this movie. I can't praise it highly enough. See it immediately.",Booksmart
24,Turfseer,Witty dialogue trumps predictable plot in enjoyable last day of high school coming of age romp,6,5 June 2019,"Booksmart is actor turned first time director Olivia Wilde's coming of age tale set on the last day at a Los Angeles high school in an upscale neighborhood. The protagonists are Molly (Beanie Feinstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever). Feinstein is Jonah Hill's sister in real life and doesn't rest on nepotism to further her career-she's actually quite talented. Feinstein's Molly, a somewhat portly but real brainy valedictorian is best friends with Amy, ""out"" for two years, who has a crush on a fellow female student, Ryan.
As an overachiever, Molly is dismayed to learn that most of her fellow students are going to Ivy League schools as well, but managed to breeze by without her overly serious and nose to the grindstone demeanor. So Molly convinces Amy that their last night after high school should be spent partying, to prove somehow that they aren't just a duo of stick-in-the-muds.
The Act II adventure begins when the intrepid pals attempt to locate a party thrown by Nick, the class vice president, the tall, handsome dude Molly has a crush on. They're aware it's at Nick's aunt's house but they don't know the address. Their misadventures before arriving at Nick's and at his party, are really only a vehicle to showcase the witty banter between the two principals. This is really Booksmart's primary selling point.
Indeed there is a high level of intelligence in the banter between Molly and Amy especially when Amy delivers (for example) such witty bon mots as to why she's going to Botswana for a summer internship (Uganda is out of the question since she fears she might be executed due to the country's condemnation of gay sexuality; in Botswana she's free to give out tampons for sex education!).
You'll also notice that Booksmart really has no certifiable external antagonists. The usual group of high school bullies is missing and their classmates are a group of ditsy cut-ups, including Jared, a do-gooder whose kind-hearted acts are motivated by guilt feelings about being wealthy; Gigi, seemingly bipolar, who slips drugs into some of Molly and Amy's food while on Jared's yacht, later causing them to hallucinate; and their acerbic, witty gay friend George, who throws a wild (funny!) Murder Mystery party.
There are no real mean adults either which include Amy's overly well-meaning Christian parents; Mr. Brown, their high school principal who moonlights as a Lyft driver and Ms. Fine, a teacher at their school, who picks Molly and Amy up at a crucial moment when Molly calls her just before her cell phone runs out. An opportunity is lost when the film's scenarists fail to develop Amy's parents as fully fleshed out characters. Worse yet, we never meet Molly's parents at all!
Without external antagonists, it's Molly and Amy's internal arcs that drive the narrative. Both at heart are insecure about being successful in a romantic relationship. The second act ""dark moment"" occurs when Molly and Amy have a falling out after Amy accuses Molly of being manipulative and overbearing, always ordering her what to do. Before the inevitable apology, Amy gets involved with Hope, a gay student, who has a reputation for being ""cruel"" among her classmates.
The Booksmart screenplay was written by four different writers and it shows. The plot is wildly uneven and the payoff when they finally arrive at Nick's party is a little bit of a letdown. Some of it is quite amusing (such as the previously alluded to ""Murder Mystery"" play) but not all the hijinks are laugh out loud funny.
Go see Booksmart for Feinstein's and Dever's standout comic performances. And take note of Wilde's directing skills, not only of the actors but in the excellent editing and cinematography on hand here as well. Despite the rather predictable plot, Booksmart features some top notch dialogue, that will keep you amused pretty much throughout.",Booksmart
25,jadavix,"Amusing by turns, and even touching occasionally",7,4 February 2020,"""Booksmart"" gets off to a shaky start, not really allowing you to warm to the characters nor believe what you're seeing. In particular, the characters aside from the two leads are totally unbelievable, and seem like caricatures of a sort of person who may not in fact exist.The plot is totally familiar: over-achieving student(s) realise they haven't gone crazy at high school and decide to change that on one last big night. Of course, most, if not all, of the times we've seen this plot - ie. ""Project X"", ""The Girl Next Door"", ""The 18 Year Old Virgin"" - it was a boy who felt that way. And so what? Does doing the same plot with a girl in the lead really make any significant difference?The catalyst for the girls' decision to cut loose is also pretty unbelievable: they're informed by some cretinous highs school slacker types that they're also going to ""Ivy league"" colleges: Harvard and Stanford. They ALSO hit the books, they just had fun too, which our protagonists didn't.If the two leads are such high achievers, how did they not know that these goons are as well? In my experience doing well at high school puts you in contact with other people who do well. They become friends and rivals, sometimes at once.So all of that detracted from the movie, but I decided not to turn it off because it was occasionally funny, and had some surprising twists and turns. Also it was even touching in one or two moments, but I thought it was just too unbelievable, particularly in some of the characterisations, to connect on that level.I say check it out; I give it a 7.",Booksmart
26,kevin_robbins,This is step down from similar movies with this storyline (Superbad as an example) but it still worth viewing once,7,24 August 2021,"Booksmart (2019) is a movie we saw in theatres during the pandemic.

So they decide to break some rules on graduation eve. The film centers on a ribald night of wild partying by their peers and the lasting effects on these once sensible honor students.Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Deers are Molly and Amy, two ladies in search of hedonistic pleasures and these young actresses are perfectly matched in their roles. Their chemistry and comic timing is assured and very convincing. The supporting cast which includes Skyler Gisondo, Molly Gordon, and Diana Silvers is quite winning also. A shout-out to Billie Lourdes who is very funny as the drugged-up rich party girl. Also on hand are comic pros Lisa Kudrow, Will Forte, Jason Sudeikis, and Jessica Williams. You are in good hands.The film is highly inspired to be the next contemporary American Graffiti slice of teenage life with an over abundance of raunchy dialog, sexual situations, and overt drug usage. The screenplay loses some credibility and becomes rather too excessive and unbelievable as the plot progresses. (There is a drug-induced hallucination scene midway through the film that just does not work.) But the vivid characters are extremely well-written and overcome stereotypes to be convincing and empathic figures.Cleverly directed by Olivia Wilde, Booksmart is a funny and highly entertaining ode to adolescence.",Booksmart

The Hangover TrilogySUMMARY:
Booksmart delivers on the promise of being funny, making sure to jam pack the adventure with as much slapstick and crude commentary as possible. And while much of the writing is geared towards trying to use modern, aggressive comedy of swearing, ridiculous metaphors, and meme worthy phrases, it does so in a manner that isn't the same overwhelming manner that this genre throws at us, okay at least not in the same extent. Booksmart takes the adventurous aspect of the Hangover and curves it to a better plot and more focused on the broader audience. The relevance of the two girl's trials should speak to many, with the other problems exposed branching out to grab the group in a surprisingly entertaining after school special approach. As the world continues to expand, the pace manages to keep in time with it so well, making sure to slow down at key development points, only to speed up again as the next transition begins. Thus, the adventure is gloriously displayed to be both entertaining and meaningful. Yet, the biggest pillar of strength for this tale is the chemistry between Dever and Feldstein, who manage the break the awkward barriers of best friends in high school, and somehow unleash 18 years of friendship in a short time. It's through these two that many political and story-based components are artistically brought out, and with their skills adds that surprisingly deep aspect to a film that looked so ridiculous from the trailers. And perhaps it is that deeper aspect that works so well for me to help ground the silliness.
Yet with all the good, there are some limitations to this film that take away from the enjoyment. First, the lazy writing component. Clever writing and puns for slang and stupidity are enjoyable, but with every word getting bombarded with cursing... that is where you lose me. Overdoing some of the curse bombs gets old and takes away from the imaginative dialogue Booksmart holds and I had hoped for a little deviation. In addition, the extreme acts of stupidity, selfishness, and debauchery of the rules potentially will inspire younger members, but sometimes steps over the lines a little too much that the debauchery was more infuriating than entertaining. In addition, there presentation of stereotypes and other personal, political issues sometimes are a little to full frontal mode, pushing the boundaries to details that may not be as pertinent to the story, but also to uncomfortable levels who don't like displays of affection. And sadly, I had hoped the predictability of where these acts were going would have had more twists, but sadly the trailers have ruined much of the movie's acts, only leaving a little to uncover at the end. It's this factor of how much has been revealed alongside the glorification that breaking rules/acting the way these kids do is the factor of life that adds meaning that probably were the things I enjoyed the least. Thankfully, there are better life lessons to try to overshadow these.
In conclusion, the movie turns out to be a deeper adventure than I anticipated. It's going to hit the teen and young adult audiences well, alongside those that value friendship. Fantastic acting and pacing help spin this tale to better levels and I for one enjoyed the tale presented. Still, the entertainment value that glorified the reckless behavior was probably not the motif to also drown the film in either. It is still got the predictable plot and curse obsessive writing, but this reviewer was happy with the presentation and gives this one the nod of approval for a theater visit with friends.

42,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Booksmart,6,10 September 2019,"""Don't knock it until you've tried it"". So says the wide-eyed character of Molly Davidson when it comes to life and the kinky art of scissoring. Molly and a bunch of other eccentric hoodies cut loose on the last day of secondary education via 2019's Booksmart (my latest review).Anyway, Booksmart is disordered, sometimes funny, slow mo-ed, and a hot mess script-wise. It's a mad-dog (but not mean), HS comedy populated by tonal shifts, exhausting improvisation, a tripped out animation sequence, and a nasty, balls to the wall hip-hop soundtrack (I gotta admit, that's my favorite part).Olivia Wilde (a familiar name who's never helmed a movie before) steps in behind the sun-drenched camera for her nifty little debut. Watching Booksmart, it's apparent that Wilde's swagger was influenced by Can't Hardly Wait, 2007's Superbad, Sixteen Candles, and William Shakespeare's 10 Things I Hate About You. Yeah she can direct if not bootleg. It's also apparent that Liv might have channeled her inner David O. Russell (and/or John Hughes) before shooting began (hey that's just pure speculation).In Booksmart, Olivia Wilde gets good actors who are game (Beanie Feldstein, Skyler Gisondo, Kaitlyn Dever) and fosters enough spark and energy for ten Millennial farces. It's just unfortunate that her out of the box camerawork, flashy bravura, and promotion of DJ Shadow background raps can't mask the film's REM unevenness.All in all, Booksmart is another pic that's Point Grey Pictures-like (that means it's R-rated teenager stuff). It might reveal the modern psyche of today's highschool-er but it's not the one I remember (do 15 to 18-year-old kids, sheltered parents, and suspect teachers actually come off like this?). If for sheer open mindedness or leveled curiosity, I might need a couple more viewings of Booksmart to get into Wilde's raw, possibly misunderstood groove. ""Book"" it. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Booksmart

44,fntstcplnt,Booksmart (2019),7,6 March 2020,"Directed by Olivia Wilde. Starring Beanie Feldstein, Kaitlyn Dever, Billie Lourd, Skyler Gisondo, Victoria Ruesga, Mason Gooding, Diana Silvers, Noah Galvin, Jason Sudeikis, Jessica Williams, Austin Crute, Molly Gordon, Nico Hiraga, Will Forte, Lisa Kudrow. (R)Best friends Feldstein and Dever realize the day before graduation that they spent their entire time at high school worrying about grades and studying and forgot to actually have fun; cue the quest to get out to a wild party and make a move on their respective crushes (Gooding, Ruesga). Overfamiliar setup with a gender twist (and, in one case, a sexuality twist) is fast, funny, and well-acted by a mostly young cast of unknowns and up-and-comers, but not many of its observations are original and the story sacrifices authenticity in order to blaze through the occasional cartoonish scenario and make just about every supporting character an exaggerated caricature (some are quite amusing, like the sassy drama class alpha Galvin and Lourd's capricious, drug-fueled rich girl, but most are too unreasonably odd or one-dimensional). Mike O'Brien has a funny cameo as a pizza delivery driver with an unexpected secret. Directorial debut for Wilde, who injects more energy and style into the proceedings than the average teen movie.74/100",Booksmart
45,arungeorge13,Booksmart shows the evolution of teen movies over the years! [+58%],6,24 April 2020,"There's quite a bit to like in this politically correct, feminist cousin to Superbad that fully takes advantage of its R-rating. For instance, the two leads boast great screen presence and have been written with just the right amount of substance. The film, directed by Olivia Wilde, doesn't shy away from embracing its raunchy overtones. Two high-school nerds in their senior year, Molly (Beanie Feldstein, the sister of Jonah Hill) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) come to the conclusion that they've missed out on life's little-but-essential joys (read debaucheries) on their last day of school. And this one party the night before graduation is their (only) chance at redemption.What makes it interesting is the fact that Molly, who pictured herself as a know-it-all, who believed in discipline over fun, finds it disappointing when her supposedly trashy classmates have also made it to the top institutions that someone like her aspires for. This awakening is passed on Amy (a lesbian), who comes aboard the idea of wanting to explore her one-sided crush on a skater-girl Ryan. Molly also opens up to Amy regarding her attraction to Nick, a jock who's throwing a party at her aunt's.The film is equal parts nasty and nice, but I liked how Wilde focused on revealing the vulnerable sides of characters that we usually write off as one-note. The characters of Triple-A (Molly Gordon), Principal Brown (Jason Sudeikis), and Hope (Diana Silvers), in particular, were more textured than I'd expected them to be. The duo watching porn in the taxi was the funniest scene for me.It's a coming-of-age movie that unravels mostly over the course of a single night, with Molly and Amy learning a few (non-judgmental) lessons about themselves and the world in bittersweet fashion. It takes a little while for them to realize that (how big a cliché it is, still) their friendship is a few notches above all else; it's special. Sex, drugs, and alcohol are only side-missions. The directorial eye of Olivia Wilde is displayed in her choice of contemporary music, an unlikely dash of immersive theater, and dreamy underwater sequences.If the plot is derivative, the treatment definitely isn't. The film subtly lets you know that smartness lies in great observation too, not just textbooks. Maybe, that's why Booksmart makes for relatively fun viewing. It's no Superbad, but it's a solid effort for a teen movie.",Booksmart
46,Abdulxoxo,What is this?,5,1 November 2020,"""funniest movie ever"", ""Best comedy movie of the year"" people kept saying on Facebook, the praise was too much, so I decided to check out this ""funny"" movie.
This movie tried to be comedy, but it failed ultimately, if a sub-genre ""attempted comedy"" exists, this movie would have surely fall in the category. The supposedly jokes were clichè, cringey and didn't land at all. the soundtrack was loud and distracting, the supporting characters were annoying and their behavior were over-the-top bad, but the two leads, at least, were a bit likable. Some scenes were unnecessarily long and stupid like the doll scene what was that? This movie is a knock-off of every other teen movies there is.",Booksmart
47,martimusross,A Really Funny & Quirky Movie,7,30 May 2019,"BooksmartThe joy of this movie was the totally believable friendship between Amy and Molly.

Party, drugs, drinking, learning, school, teachers, parents, etc.It's a good effort. Not the best, and definitely had it's boring moments. A lot of them. But good.6 stars",Booksmart
49,Troy_Campbell,Conventional tale told with excitement.,7,16 July 2019,"Olivia Wilde's directorial debut follows two ultra-vigilant high-schoolers who let loose on graduation night in the pursuit of making up for lost time. Cue awkward parents, sexual awakenings, drunken parties, friendship tension and life-altering epiphanies. The coming-of-age tale has been around as long as cinema itself whilst the one-final-night-before-college storytelling device has become a go-to in the comedy genre, so it's the characters and their relationships that can deliver something fresh. And this is Olivia's Wilde Card: in lead pair Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, as besties Molly and Amy, she has found a charming, hilarious and charismatic pair that the audience can warm to immediately, despite and perhaps even because of, their flaws. As soon as Amy and Molly start dancing on the front lawn without a care in the world in the pre-opening credits sequence, you know that the next 90 minutes with them is going to be a hoot. Their sheer likability pulls you through the movie even when supporting players fail to make an impression and the plot falls back on cliché, both of which become more prevalent in a final act that wraps everything up a little too neatly. It doesn't break through convention or proffer a message on friendship we don't already know, but that doesn't matter, Booksmart is an affecting and joyous yarn propelled by a compelling central duo.",Booksmart
50,Jeremy_Urquhart,"I can understand why it's not for everyone, but for the most part I loved it",8,23 March 2020,"I first saw Booksmart about 9 months ago at the cinemas, and rewatched it very recently, to find it was just as entertaining as the first time. I can see this being a movie that's easy to come back to and enjoy very often. It's funny, stylishly shot, has a great soundtrack, a nice message without ever getting overly serious or preachy, and over-the-top, mostly entertaining characters who are fun to hang out with for a bit under two hours (anymore, and maybe they'd be grating and give me bad flashbacks to my own time in highschool).To enjoy Booksmart, I think you have to get on board with the film's tone. While some moments feel very real and personal, and it does have a message and broad themes that can be applied to real world situations, I do feel like it takes place in a heightened reality. It's not quite fantasy, but everything is bright, exaggerated, stylish and fast, and the film does indeed feature a supporting cast of quite crazy, over-the-top characters. This worked for me because the main characters are more grounded and often comment on the insanity, and also because it felt intentional to me. It was slightly jarring for the first scene or two, but the film is clear about the world it's trying to depict, and did a good job of easing me into it. By the time the film is about fifteen minutes in, I was just about entirely on board, and having a really good time. I don't mean to suggest that it's a weakness for another viewer to not be able to adapt and appreciate the world of this film and its somewhat manic tone, but you need to in order to full enjoy it. Of course, if the humour itself just isn't funny for you, then that's another matter altogether, and you probably won't enjoy this film then either. And given the subjectivity of humour, I'd say that's honestly okay.Booksmart maintains a mostly light-hearted tone throughout and I really appreciated that. There is some slightly predictable conflict in the third act, but it's very well-acted and written so that you more or less buy it, and the film doesn't focus on it too much before a fun and largely uplifting (though again: less than completely realistic) ending. Before this, Booksmart thrives on its fast pace, creative visuals, and insanely good chemistry between its two stars, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feinstein. Together these two are amazing, and you completely buy them as friends. Without their acting chops and their chemistry, the movie as a whole wouldn't work nearly as well.When it comes to supporting characters, they're less well-developed, and perhaps not as strongly performed, but I liked most of them, and found most funny. Billie Lourd's character might be a bit divisive: she's on a whole other level and sometimes I thought she was funny, but sometimes she was just a little too much. Even for a frantic, loud, sometimes manic comedy featuring out of control teenagers, she might have gone just a little too hard. It's an incredibly minor criticism, and even then, I didn't hate her character. She was just the only one I was split on, in terms of finding her funny sometimes, but sometimes a little grating.There are other minor complaints that hold this back from being higher than an 8/10 in my book. Like I said, the conflict is disappointingly predictable, but not as dwelled upon or cheesy as it might have been with less skilled directors and actors pulling it off. Not every joke lands, but there are so many this is another incredibly small nitpick. Also it ends quite suddenly, subverting an emotional ending for a quick and jarring joke that makes me wonder which approach would have actually been more effective.But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what might be wrong with this movie when there's also so much right with it. It's a strong contender for the most fun movie of 2019, and I'd highly recommend it at the moment, if you're feeling stressed or under pressure due to various global circumstances. It's broad and over the top and eager to entertain you, and a great success in this regard. I wouldn't hate the idea of a sequel, but if not, am still excited to see what the two lead actresses do next, as well as watch Olivia Wilde's (hopefully inevitable) directorial follow-up.It's one of the best coming of age/ teen movies in a decade that had a surprisingly large number of good ones. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good, funny, fast-paced movie.",Booksmart
51,vithiet,"As far as teen comedies go, this is a good one!",7,15 December 2020,"I went in not knowing much outside of my friend recommending it. Reading the reviews, I don't think they're really fair one to compare it to Superbad or anything else really... it's just a funny, cute comedy on its own. Others are complaining about the lack of credibility of some situations, which is basically the case for 99% of comedies out there so I fail to see how that is relevant. In the end this was entertaining with some good performances from a relatively unknown cast, so I recommend it!",Booksmart
52,kevin c,Consistent comedy ?!?!,8,23 February 2020,"Coming-of-age high school movie is given a shot in the arm, and a comedy that doesn't run out of steam. Booksmart conforms closely to the typical end-of-school drama while mocking many of the conventions.Amy and Molly really do seem to be friends, and thankfully never lose their powers of observation or their flair for self-deprecating one-liners. Booksmart works as a satire, and as a film about friendship and growing up.",Booksmart
53,muamba_eats_toast,Full of heart and good intentions,8,7 May 2019,To begin with I didn't think I was going to enjoy the film as much as I ended up doing it was quite flat and slow to begin but gradually warmed up into a fresh coming of age tale. Whilst from the trailer I expected a LOL comedy it was far more than that it was corageous and full of heart. That being said given how it was portrayed I would have liked a few more laughs although there're were just about more than a handful of members that I laughed out loud which was ok hut could have been even better. Overall a solidly good coming of age comedy.,Booksmart
54,blott2319-1,Simply not funny,4,11 August 2021,"I've never been a fan of teens-gone-wild movies, so I kind of suspected when I heard Booksmart was like a modern Superbad, that I would hate it. Sure enough this was nails-on-a-chalkboard levels of annoyance for the majority of the runtime. For one thing, I find the very premise of this movie to be ridiculous and dumb. I do not buy that screw-ups and slackers are commonly getting accepted to ivy league schools, in fact I don't even buy that there is this large a quantity of students from the same high school that get into the ivy league. But even if you accept the central conceit of Booksmart there's the general ridiculous behavior of the people in it. I refuse to believe actual teenagers behave in this fashion. I know I'm old and way out of touch, but if this is really how high school looks in this day and age, I shudder for the future of humanity.The nonsensical night of chaos is almost completely intolerable to me and I never once even chuckled. The places they went and the cars they rode in never made for humorous situations in my opinion and felt more annoying than anything else. But then they got to the final destination, and Booksmart turned a corner for me. It's in these scenes where I felt something approaching reality was taking place. The people they interact with and the tone of their interactions were suddenly down-to-earth and relatable. For a movie that was going to be one of my least favorite of all time, the fact that I genuinely started to care about the main characters and what was happening to them was kind of astounding. I can't say that I liked Booksmart, because what it was attempting (comedy) utterly failed for me, but I can say there were moments that clicked and that kept it from being a total trainwreck.",Booksmart
55,reddiemurf81,"Just as good, if not better than Superbad",6,3 January 2020,"While I'm not necessarily a fan of everything that happened in this movie,, I have to say that it was fun to watch. The two female leads were an awesome duo who need to be paired up again. The rest of the cast was very good as well.
If you're thrown off by bad language, drug & alcohol use, sexual promiscuity,,, well obviously this is not a movie you'll enjoy.
If you enjoy raunchy comedies,, then this is right up your alley.",Booksmart
56,kz917-1,Bless their hearts...,5,4 November 2019,They tried.I have to admit I laughed heartily at times. But other moments were downright painful.Billie Lourd is epic and steals the show in her scenes.A girl buddy comedy reflecting on high school and that they should have partied more!,Booksmart
57,aciessi,Life of the Party.,9,9 June 2019,"Booksmart is being compared to many films. Superbad and Bridesmaids just to name a few. I feel that no comparison gives this film any justice. Booksmart is it's own thing, and it's a pretty damn good thing. A brand-new classic hang-out movie. Whip smart, really funny and endearing. This is Olivia Wilde's directorial debut. I have one word of advice for you, Olivia. Please keep making movies.Booksmart is about senior year of high school, and the two most unlikely party crashers, Molly and Amy. Both overachieve in academics and passionately wear their progressive political hearts on the sleeves. They think they have it so good, until they realize that everyone else around them partied just as hard as they studied. The shocking realization sets in that they may have wasted four years of high school by being ""not-fun"". Even worse, it's the last day of school and graduation is tomorrow. Molly and Amy form a pact, that on this night, they party as hard as they can before graduation to prove to the world that they can get down as hard as the rest of the class.Chaos ensues. A wild night filled with memories they will never forget, if those memories include robbing a Pizza boy who happens to be a serial killer on the run, and tripping balls on drugged up strawberries resulting in a bad trip where the girls turn into Barbie dolls. No joke is too overdone, or too gross, or too raunchy. But theres too many of them to count. Booksmart throws so many ideas at the wall, and all of them stick. Why does it all work so well? Well, not only do we have a naturally gifted director in Olivia Wilde (given her mother, could be genetics) and an ingeniously clever script written by four brilliant ladies, but also because the entire array of characters, every last one of them, are three dimensional and fully realized in their own special ways. I fell in love with all of them. The privileged rich kid with a heart of gold, the flirty young teacher, Amy's dorky parents, the pseudo-hipster principal (Sudeikis), the Drama school power couple, and so many more. All are familiar people you might know, and thankfully, none of them are sidelined or relegated to simple cheap shots or stereotypes. Wilde treats them all as equals, and has affection for them. They all bring Booksmart together, within a wonderful, goofy universe that ultimately teaches our two main characters to not be so judgmental and uptight. In the end, Molly and Amy find the healthy balance between hard work and good fun, and all the while, spending time with people they thought they were too good for. Booksmart's moral is quite simple. Loosen up. Guaranteed, it will loosen you up.",Booksmart
58,rockman182,Booksmart (2019),9,27 May 2019,"I may have just found my favorite film of 2019. I loved this from start to finish. It was like a gender reversed but much superior version of Superbad. When I heard that Olivia Wilde was directing this, I soon realized why Jason Sudeikis was attached. No seriously, the trailer for this looked amazing and I was expecting a raucous good time. It is everything you expected and much more. I feel like I can go on and on about everything I liked about this but I'll try to contain my excitement.The film is about two very studious high school seniors who have successful college and career ambitions lined up. They realize that all the slackers of their year also got into prestigious colleges and thus feel like they need to party and break some rules before they graduate from high school. The film follows the pair on their night of debauchery and mischief while highlighting their longing for love and the tests to their friendship. The film stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein.There are three aspects of the film that deserve high praise. First up the soundtrack. Every piece of sonic goodness used in the film is spectacular and fits the moments int he film to a tee. Second, the lively and hilarious screenplay at work. Its a fresh coming of age/teenage partying story. As mentioned earlier, its a lot like Superbad but way better. Lastly, the chemistry between Dever and Feldstein is off the charts. Its like they grew up together. Dever I know from her stint on Justified, so I was glad to see her in a leading role here. Feldstein was great in Ladybird (which I also loved), Feldstein is absolutely mesmerizing in her role.This film is funny almost everywhere. Hardly any dull moments. It just feels so real; from the close friendship of the girls to the high school ""stereotypes"" if you will. Shout out to Billie Lourd who thrives in the role she was pretty much always born to play. I left the cinema with a big smile on my face and a longing to see the film again. We are about halfway done with the year and I can already see this as being one of the personal standouts of the year for me. Well done, all around.9/10",Booksmart
59,jon.h.ochiai,"Does ""Booksmart"" Define You?",10,27 May 2019,"First-time Director Olivia Wilde's ""Booksmart"" is hysterical raunch, yet profoundly sweet. In the acutely aware screenplay by Susanna Fogel, Emily Halpen, Sarah Haskins, and Katie Silberman, Olivia wistfully helms the coming of age tale of high school seniors Amy and Molly, wonderfully personified by Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein. BFFs Amy and Molly, are brilliant 18 year-olds embracing their inner and outer nerd. When Amy picks up Molly for school in her parents' old model Volvo, the two breakout into their campy bad hip-hop dance routine. Kaitlyn and Beanie have the unique loving chemistry that constructs ""Booksmart"".In their focused studies, sacrificing any semblance of social life, Amy and Molly attain their cherished goals. Molly is going to Yale. Amy got accepted to Columbia University- she'll spend the summer helping making tampons for underprivileged women and girls in Batswana. Yep, that's Amy. The social conscious duo's Heroes include Michelle Obama and Malala.In 10th grade Amy came out as gay. Straight Molly leverages this. Molly hilariously tortures Amy's parents Charmaine and Doug, funny clueless Will Forte and Lisa Kudrows. When Amy says she's ""going to the library with Molly"", she's really going to the library with Molly.About her possible college sex-life, Amy reminds Molly, ""Dude, scissoring is not a thing."" Too funny. This too, defines the funny sweetness of their partnership. Amy is in love with iconoclast skateboard girl Ryan, played by charmingly flite Victoria Ruesga. Soon-to-be former Class President Molly is mad crushing on her Vice-President Nick, played by smooth handsome Mason Goodling. Yes, our girls value other things besides books.One insightful narrative of ""Booksmart"" is stereotype. Amy is the unconsciously pretty savant, who follows Molly's every wish, refusing to make waves. Kaitlyn is authentic gentle quirk and vulnerability. She's the 'straight-man' to Molly's comic diva. Kaitlyn is going to be a Star. Beanie's Molly is the almost plus-sized Ivy League genius, who has forsaken popularity to proving that she's better than everyone else. Her wit is her weapon. Therein lies karma.Molly confronts the cruel gossip about herself in the girls' restroom, ""Everything, but her personality..."" Yeah, Molly is going to Yale. So is Triple A, played by haute Molly Gordon, who scored 1560 on her SATs (1600 is perfect). Her tag refers to her reputation for rendering dudes ""roadside assistance"". At least that's what 'others' are saying. Compounding Molly's chagrin: Stoner Tanner, played by Nico Hiraga, is going to Stanford on soccer scholarship, and slacker Theo, played by Eduardo Franco, is starting at Google with salary in the mid-six figures. They all didn't take school nearly as seriously as Molly and Amy. Molly is totally: WTF?So Molly enrolls Amy into one all-night party binge before Graduation. They'll crash Nick's Party. However, Amy and Molly don't roll with the ""cool kids"". They have no idea where the party is. Amy wants to make a move for Ryan. Molly wants a hook up with Nick. Here Director Olivia and Writers kind of go derivative ""The Hangover"", yet in a good way. Olivia wisely sails raunchy seas with surprising heart.There's the signature loser party detour with Molly's rich wannabe popular dude Jared, played by funny geeky Skyer Gisondo, and his overtly platonic companion Gigi, played by amazing Billie Lourd. Not surprisingly, nerds and drugs don't mix- well. Using their hair as facial masks, Amy and Molly attempt to hijack the pizza delivery guy, who warns them not expose their phone password.Watching the suffering heartbreak in Amy's face emerging from the pool, I got it. Amy like all of us, just wanted to be loved, to fall madly in love. Kaitlyn's Amy also wanted the same for her BFF Molly. At times Amy and Molly argue vehemently, that's because they want the other to be happy. When Molly confesses to Amy that she had to ""shove down"" her feeling for Nick, possibly because of how she may occur, Amy says, ""You don't have to shove anything down!"" That's love. That's seeing the other as greater than, when they don't see it. That's what makes ""Booksmart"" something special.There are an awful lot of labels out there. Nerd. Jock. Princess. Smart. Beautiful. Not Pretty. Stereotypes and labels are just part of our deal. In Olivia Wilde's ""Booksmart"", really we're the ones who get to define who we are. Along with Olivia, Kaitlyn, and Beanie: We're just saying.",Booksmart
60,RforFilm,"Booksmart seems like a girl version of Superbad...and that it. It's serviceable, but nothing new",5,3 May 2019,"There are a lot of things that teachers and adults don't tell teenagers before they set out into the world. One of those things is that what happens in high school rarely every carries over to college or anything at all. Is the popular girl the president of ASB? Did someone play catcher on the baseball team and was a star hitter? Was a guy a class clown who also happened to be a good singer in drama? These people can still go on to do amazing things, but once they receive their diplomas at graduation, their social record is wiped clean.And yet, we still tell kids that the ""experience"" of high school is just as important. Is it really? It's only four years in ones lifetime that wont matter if they've found something better to do. This is also a reason a lot of kids goof off in class; they know their childhood is coming to an end and that whatever trouble they cause is unlikely to hurt them as adults. That's not say there aren't consequences, but I still believe that a little rule breaking is okay as long as no one is hurt and doesn't go too far. Two girls experience this in Booksmart.On their last day of school, two best friends, Amy (played by Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (played by Beanie Feldstien) contemplate their roles as star academics and leaders of their clubs while everyone else goes wild with pranks and goofs. They see themselves as succeeding while thinking everyone is wasting their opportunity. It's not until Molly overhears some kids who she assumed would fail are going to big schools and even getting jobs at Google. That's when she understands that everyone worked just as hard as they did, only for them to have more fun then they did.Not wanting to go out as cold and uncool, Molly convinces Amy to try and find a party at a popular kid's place in order to show they can have fun too. Molly also convinces Amy, and out lesbian, that this is her chance to connect with a girl she likes Ryan. What starts with an easy goal turns difficult as they come across weird kids, other strange parties, creepy pizza men, and phones going dead. It's the craziest night the two are ever going to have, but there's also change on the horizons for their friendship.Booksmart sounds like a girl version of Superbad...and that's what it is. It's another shenanigans-style comedy that wants to prove that girls can be just as raunchy as the boys. The good news is that they do have a lot of setups for jokes. The problem is that I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. For example, the girls go to the wrong party that turns out to be a murder mystery dinner. They could have taken advantage of the goofiness and other actor friends, but they take a drug trip instead. It gets a laugh, but why couldn't they have done both.It's not that the actors are trying. In fact, I really like both Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstien (who you may remember as the best friend in Ladybird). They have the chops to land a couple of jokes that I did laugh at. Their at their best when their conversations lead into funny subjects. I think where the script fails is giving that joking plot better pacing. There are moments that I liked, but then things slow down and I start to drift away until the movie figures out the next step.Before anything, I want to also talk about the Kaitlyn's character. I admire the movie for already having her out of the closet and making her like any other high school girl. I even like her goal...which is the same as a lot of other high school comedies. Even when a twist happens, it's a twist that's also been done in a lot of comedies and romance. I can see a lot of people seeing this as new and inspired just because the character is gay. In my mind, no matter what sexuality a character is, I still wish that they try for something more original.I'll give this five school textbooks out of ten. It's not perfect and falls into a lot of cliché territory, but I can see people laughing at this. In a way, while I wouldn't recommend this for myself, I can see a lot of kids and even adults finding this fine. I wouldn't call this revolutionary, but a serviceable enough comedy that it'll generate some laughs.",Booksmart

It was a badly cast hodpodge of everything wrong with american cinema, why would anyone want to watch 90 mins of Beanie Feldstein badly scratching her way through miscalculated scenarios for non laughs. How can we get on her side when she's terrible and her character is terrible.
Yeah, the loud hiphop music, we get it, we've seen it in everything and it has no impact any more.
The only character with any charm in the whole movie was Skyler Gisondo and he was just channeling his santa clarita diet character, which might just be him playing himself.

63,abisio,PERHAPS THE FUNNIESTCOMEDY OF THE YEAR SO FAR,10,10 June 2019,"I must clarify that I am a man and not particularly fond of ""ckick flics"", however my wife wanted to go, I followed and frankly I was pleasantly surprised. This movie follows the structure of SUPERBAD but with young women. I had a few laughs with SUPERBAD but I never considered to good nor too original.
Cannot say the same about BOOKSMART.
The concept is not politically correct by today standards but realistic in many ways; not only for women but for men too.
The last day of high school two boring self sufficient (and not very humble,) ""NERDS"" find out that other high school alumnis achieved similar success without dedicating their best years to full study and no life. and no friends other than themselves.
Obviously they want to live all together in their last school night but things got more complicated and find out that fulfilling not academic things has lot of difficulties that books can not always resolve.
As directed by Olivia Wilde; there very specific women aspects and details that men might not fully understand; however humor; even in the most gross jokes (which are plenty ) is handled with delicacy but is still incredible funny.
I am pretty sure some ""classic thinking"" women might dislike this movie. Aside from the ""inmoral"" message of study but have some fun too; the end is not about love found, losing virginity or just that happy. Is about the value of friendship and growing in oneself.",Booksmart
64,bob-the-movie-man,A panda's eye view of teenage life.,9,13 November 2019,"I tend to struggle to find a really good comedy to add to my top 10 of the year. Last year it was ""Game Night"" that made my list. One that is definitely heading there this year is ""Booksmart"".The coming of age school comedy has been rehashed multiple times. These include films as varied as ""Napoleon Dynamite"", ""Superbad"", ""Easy A"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"". In tone, ""Booksmart"" is probably closest to ""Superbad"", but it manages - under the direction of actress Olivia Wilde, in her debut feature - to establish a quirky likeability all of its own. An instant classic in the making.But it's not for the prudish. The story concerns two BFF's - Molly (Beanie Feldstein, sister of Jonah Hill) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever). They have both spent their young lives trying to score A's at school in lieu of all other distractions. On the eve of their graduation, Molly realises that this was not a binary option. Her school companions have managed to get all of the success without any of the self-sacrifice! She calls ""Malala""! And the duo proceed on a drink and drug-fuelled night to catch up on all the school social life they have missed out on!Part of this catching up includes sex, and with Amy as a naive wannabe lesbian, in awe of tom-boy skateboarder Ryan (Victoria Ruesga), coming out has never seemed so painful.I first saw this on a plane and guffawed so much that I went out to buy the DVD for a family viewing. Watching it again though, it is really very, very rude. If you were to categorize it, I think ""sex comedy"" would be a primary tag. A clumsy but realistic scene between Amy and the ""hot girl"" Hope (Diana Silvers... who really is) is excruciatingly hard to watch. This can therefore prove an uncomfortable co-watch for 'young folks' who - despite all the obvious evidence! - assume their parents / in-laws have done nothing in the past other than hold hands!! 🙂Kaitlyn Dever has cut her teeth with supporting roles on a few B-grade movies this year including ""Beautiful Boy"" and ""The Front Runner"". But here she takes centre stage and is an absolute revelation as the sexually bemused teen. While Beanie Feldstein has the more obvious comic lead role, it is Dever who continually grabbed my attention with her acting skills. This young lady is added to my ""one to watch"" list.This is not to decry the rest of the cast. For this is a great ensemble performance from a pretty unknown cast. The only familiar faces are Lisa Kudrow and Jason Sudeikis, but they only have bit parts.The only role that didn't quite work for me was that of the kooky drugged out hippie Gigi (Billie Lourd). It was all a bit too over-the-top for me in a movie that didn't really needI think this will prove to be a firm young person's favourite for many years to come. Whether you will find it funny or not will probably depend on the setting of your 'crudometer' and your resilience to bad language on screen. For me, personally, I am clearly still 17 on the inside! I loved it. Not only do I think it a good comedy. It is also a feel-good movie about best friends; a coming of age lesbian adventure; and a film that treats the multi-coloured spectrum of modern sexual variety as something entirely normal and to be celebrated.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

65,kjproulx,Hilarious and Authentic from Start to Finish,10,28 May 2019,"From Ferris Bueller's Day Off to Superbad (just to name a couple), the teenage comedy sub-genre has been around forever and are usually among the best of their respective years, in comparison with broader comedies. Booksmart is the latest comedy to hit the big screen and while I see it having trouble catching on with a wide audience, this is easily my favourite film of the year, so far. If you're a fan of comedies at all, but also enjoy great performances and characters, then this movie may end up being loved by you as it was by me. Let's dive into why I believe this movie deserves to be called one of the best of the year.Following two high school seniors, as they are on the brink of graduation, they realize that everyone around them, even those who are popular, have gotten into good schools, the same way they have. Feeling the need to do everything they missed out on in terms of partying, they decide to cram it all into one night. How similar these two behave, while also being incredibly different on the inside is really what sold this film for me, but having two of the best young actresses didn't hurt either.Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein are easily two of the most impressive young actresses I've seen on-screen in quite some time. Their performances sold these characters in such a raw and realistic way, that I found myself engrossed in every moment this film had to offer. The characters themselves were already written well by Susanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, and Katie Silberman, but the devotion to these characters is what sent it over the edge for me, which is how I see many viewers feeling. Also, I would just like to add a little nod to Skyler Gisondo's portrayal of the character Jared. Although receiving very little screen time, his few scenes had me laughing quite hard. I always enjoy seeing him in films.The biggest star of this film; However, is Olivia Wilde in the director's chair. Normally I don't call too much attention to directors, simply because a positive review is really only positive due to the wonderful directing job anyways, but Wilde is someone to watch out for. I've always liked her as an actress, but I'm always shocked when an actor or actress decides to take a chance behind the camera and shine brightly. Her work here from some clear decisions on set to how she pulled amazing performances from everyone involved should not be taken lightly.In the end, Booksmart may have felt like another ordinary comedy about teenagers finding themselves, but from the screenplay to the direction, to how everything plays out so impressively well on-screen, I found myself very impressed. Hilariously throughout the majority of the runtime, while also being very dramatic and heartfelt when it needed to be, this, as of now, has to be my favourite film yet of 2019. Highly recommend checking this one out.",Booksmart
66,AhmedSpielberg99,Unfunny and Unoriginal!,5,10 July 2019,"It has some very sporadic chuckles in its first half, flashes of wit, and striking performances especially from the two leads. But other than that, It's neither funny nor original. I have seen quite few films with this theme, or that are classified under this sub-genre (I haven't even seen Superbad), but I already found everything here quite familiar. The plot itself is clichéd, insipid, formulaic, and oversimplified. And you can clearly notice that at every single turning point in the story. And there are a lot in the second half, for it's very overstuffed, messy, and muddled. And that, of course, caused a lot of tonal imbalances.I'm really frustrated because I thought I would see something like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's fantastic and highly auspicious directorial debut. But Booksmart seems to think it is much smarter then it actually is. I have to give Olivia Wilde points for making such an energetic and colorful film, though. Also, these flashes of wit I've mentioned above are all due to Wilde's direction. I do think she has a quite promising directorial career.(5.5/10)",Booksmart
67,tm-sheehan,Not my genre- A Mad Hatters Teen Party,6,11 July 2019,"My Review- Booksmart 6/10I find so called Professional movie reviewers opinions can differ enormously to your own and while sometimes a good guide and interesting to read they can lead you astray.I always say the best movie critic for your particular taste in movies is yourself and I have a very broad taste in movies but American rom comes like Bridesmaids is not one of them.Booksmart for me was one of those movies until I settled into it when I was debating whether to walk out.
It was like falling down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland and all the characters were there it truly is a Mad Hatters Tea Party but not as interesting and totally aimed at a teenage audience between the ages of 15 and 20.Unlike the brilliant 2017 coming of age movie Lady Bird ,which had plenty of humour and teenage angst this movie relies on at times gross Bridesmaids style humour and an ear splitting soundtrack that even overrides one of the most important scenes in the film.
If I was a parent of a teenager it would scare the life out of me,especially with the recent drug overdose casualties of huge dance party's.It's such an American stereotype movie the parents are cardboard comic cutouts the gay male characters are effeminate and I found slightly offensive and the lifestyle is American Dream home ,no one from struggle town in this film and the teenagers depicted are spoilt indulged brats.After all that criticism I have to say Kaitlin Dever as Amy and
Beanie Feldstein as Molly are excellent together and I believed they could be best friends but this movie was just not for me, judge it for yourselves.",Booksmart

69,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,30 September 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Last year, I missed A Vigilante from Olivia Wilde, and I still haven't watched it. Over time, I gradually lost interest, and I might have even forgotten about its existence. However, after watching Booksmart (which arrived late as hell to my country), I'm definitely watching the former soon. I was never that big of a fan of the young-adult, high-school, coming-of-age type of movies, but some of my favorite films of the last few years (Lady Bird, The Edge of Seventeen) actually belong to that genre. Why am I enjoying these low-budget flicks more than others?Well, it can't be a coincidence that every director that tackled these movies is either tremendously talented or shows incredible potential. In addition to this, all of these films (all directed by a woman) address a teenage story starring one or more female main characters. Now, hang on to your horses: no, these movies aren't good because they're made by women. No, the story isn't captivating or entertaining due to the protagonists being women. These films are great simply because they're made by filmmakers who know what to do with a camera and a story, besides starring brilliant actors... It just happens that all of these persons are women.I'm not part of any movement or hate group. I don't care about politics. I hate people that let their reviews be influenced by external themes, ultimately being unfair to the movie. That said, I have no doubts that these films are better because they have women producing, directing, writing, and starring in it. Booksmart is extremely funny while being as realistic as possible at the same time. Tonally, Wilde seamlessly balances her movie, flowing through each plot point with no major missteps. Although, some occasional detours unnecessarily stretch the runtime, namely a few subplots that didn't really offer anything worth the time, besides being a bit exaggerated.Nevertheless, the main storyline never loses its focus. Amy and Molly smoothly drive the screenplay through entertaining moments as well as grounded, pretty dramatic scenes. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever are spectacular! I can't remember the last time I watched such a phenomenal duo of protagonists, especially when it comes to young actors/actresses. They have impeccable chemistry, and it's quite noticeable that some sequences are undoubtedly improvised. They also deliver one of the best one-on-one verbal confrontations ever put to screen. Just one long take with both giving their all. Outstanding acting, fantastic filmmaking.With these two actresses carrying the story forward, every single scene is elevated. The comedy bits are amusing, but the romantic drama surrounding them is addressed in such a genuine manner. Kudos to each and every screenwriter that worked on the scripts. To Olivia Wilde, I leave my wish of seeing her in more features. She has her own style, and she definitely has a lot to say, so I can't wait for her next films. Booksmart carries enough sweet messages that will surely connect with audiences all over the world, whether you're young, old, men or women. It still carries some cliches from the genre (not trusting your BFF, even though it's clear you're wrong), but it's the play on stereotypes (not everyone seems what they show) that wins at the end.All in all, Olivia Wilde places her name on the list of directors to watch closely for the next few years. Booksmart is a wonderful addition to the coming-of-age genre, one that possesses two astonishing protagonists. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever might become superstars in the future if they continue to display such remarkable performances. With the help of a great supporting cast as well, Wilde shows the exciting and entertaining side of graduating high-school, but also all of the real dramas that teenagers go through, with no restraints. It's a character-driven story, and Amy and Molly are two persons that we should learn a lot from. It's one of the best movies of the genre, even though it still contains some of its famous cliches and a few subplots that don't quite come together. Definitely, give it a watch!",Booksmart
70,cardsrock,Olivia Wilde shines in her directorial debut,7,25 November 2019,"Booksmart hits a lot of familiar beats from most coming of age stories, but a relatable message and Olivia Wilde's terrific direction makes this film worth viewing. I identified with the central theme of the film, but some of the premise was a little tough to believe. The actors were solid and most of the jokes landed, so I could overlook some of the story issues, especially the ending. Olivia Wilde films some excellent sequences though that really add to the film.",Booksmart

More recent attempts tend to devolve into attempts at shock humor. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it is rarely ever character driven. This one? This one felt different. The protagonists were so real and so likable. The decision to zero in on the smart kids, and make their friendship the focal point changed everything. It took a high school party comedy and turned it into a genuinely touching...high school party comedy. It reminded me a bit of Bridesmaids, except with high schoolers. And that is high praise from me. At any rate, it may not have been Ferris Bueller, but it was thoroughly fun nonetheless.",Booksmart
72,apryla-58795,Yeah...cause all of that stuff happens IRL,5,1 December 2019,"Kaitlyn Deaver (Amy) and Beanie Feldstein (Molly) play best friends in high school in Olivia Wilde's (her maiden last name is Cockburn but she doesn't seem to follow the theme of her movie which is to be yourself and don't worry about what others think so she decided to adopt the more exotic Wilde for her professional name) directorial debut. Molly and Amy have spent their entire school career studying and having nil social life just so they can get into good colleges...only to find out that their slacker counterparts got into good colleges too (college admissions scandal poke anyone?) Outraged they decide they are going to live it up the night before graduation with every intention of cramming four years of partying into one night. Thus sets off events that follow Superbad BUT for females.For being her first time directing this could've been worse but it was completely UNORIGINAL and that loses points for me. How many movies are there out there that are just like this?! Too many to list so even if some parts were funny this just felt meh because it's like they were trying to be all woke but it just fell flat.I have never taken a shine to Kaitlyn Deaver. I think she's very unattractive and I don't understand why she's a thing. She can act so I do give her credit for that and I have to say that even though I haven't liked her in anything she's previously starred in I did like her character in this one.I hope to see more of Beanie Feldstein as she's absolutely hilarious and really has great screen presence.I know that Olivia Wilde probably threw Jessica Jones in there to show just how woke she is in order to make sure that all the races were represented and all the LGBTQ stuff was hardcore front and center (as if somehow being a catty and mean homosexual or of color makes you better than everyone else...I'm sorry but mean is mean no matter your sexual preference so why are they holding that up like something to be revered? I'll never understand that) because she loves to present herself as someone who's open to absolutely everything. She would be the type that if a fellow movie star decided they wanted to marry their dog and walk around kissing it openly on the mouth she would actively endorse that...so I don't give a lot of credence to stuff that she does because she's just way too open and accepting of everything-it's like what do you believe in? Everything?! That can be kind of lame so with that being said Jessica Jones was not funny at all. She had no point being in this other than being the flavor of the month at the time this was made and because Olivia Wilde Cockburn Sudeikis wanted to portray herself a certain way. JJ really failed to make the most of her two minutes onscreen-also making fun of teachers sleeping with students is just creepy and gross not to mention...it's illegal. Even if that kid was not underage you cannot have sex with a student. That was terrible and Olivia should be ashamed of herself. Let's see how open she is when her son has sex with his teacher when he's a teenager. I'm sure she'll be singing a different tune then but since it's just a movie she can laugh at it. Predatory illegal behavior is not a laughing matter. It's sick!I do love Jason Sudeikis. I wish he would act more (where even is he now? Is he
Olivia's house husband due to her ""all women all the time"" thing? He gave her kids so he's served his purpose?) because I think he's hilarious but he was not funny in this at all. Totally just there because his wife was directing. That scene in the van was so bad I was cringing watching it.I definitely think some of the best scenes in this movie were in the trailer and the rest was just filler that was not funny at all so don't think I could recommend it because it's just too cliché and unoriginal BUT I have seen worse so it wasn't as bad as it could've been.

74,garethcrook,"Not smart, but fun.",6,22 March 2020,"I fancied a laugh, god knows we need it in the current climate. I can be a bit hit and miss with comedy though, I shy away from the cringey stuff, favouring the satirical and quirky. This falls firmly in the cringe category, but hey give it a go right? Amy and Molly are high school over achievers, who on the eve of graduation decide they've dedicated too much time to academic pursuits and set out to make up for lost time with one crazy night of partying. Of course it doesn't go to plan... or does it. It's pretty predictable and obvious where they're headed (or not headed) as they traverse the ridiculous cast of some of the most irritating characters I've seen on screen. For some unfathomable reason though, I liked it. I'm really not sure why, maybe because of Dever and Feldstein in the leads, who although still farcical caricatures, are entertaining. Or maybe it's just because they're not as annoying as everyone else.
Their goal is simple, get to the cool kids party. Getting there though is anything but. It's overblown the plot having all the subtlety of being written on a brick and bazooka'd into your face. A night of discovery, self realisation and all those other American teen movie tropes. I'll forgive it for the inclusion of LCD Soundsystem on the soundtrack though and the animated doll sequence did make me laugh, but that was about it.

76,andrewroy-04316,Booksmart is a fantastic modern high school comedy,8,23 October 2019,"While the parallels and cliches we've seen in many similar movies are obvious, Booksmart also does feel fresh and honest. The Superbad comparison is quite apt, as they both are high school comedies where two best friends who are struggling with high school coming to and end and potentially separating ways go on an adventure to make it to a big party and make their dreams happen. Booksmart doesn't have as many absolutely hilarious, laugh out loud moments for me as Superbad or 21 Jump Street did, but it's still a strong amusing script and the emotional notes are nailed perfectly. It's a funny connection that Feldstein is the sister of Superbad's Jonah Hill, but it was Dever's performance that elevated the film for me. Feldstein was fun because Molly was such a well written and interesting character, but not a complex character to play, while Amy requires balance in subdued support of Molly while also finding her own path, and Dever is excellent. Many of the funniest moments also come from her (the scene where they turn into dolls and watching porn in the backseat come to mind), and the script really gives the two so much space to play off each other in funny ways. It's clearly set in our modern climate, where feminism and acceptance are crucial, but the writers do a great job of clearly showing it without overdoing it, and also struck a great balance of being a sex comedy without being ridiculous at all. Having a female director and team of female writers that work together to thoughtfully make this movie really pays dividends. The third act is the best part of the movie and what convinced me that it's great. Their confrontation at the party held so much tension because it was in such clear contrast to how they constantly build each other up to that point. Their friendship and chemistry felt genuine and warm, which made the ending so satisfying. Plenty of directorial choices worked really well - the two that come to mind are the underwater scene and the confrontation where sound cuts out and we see everyone in the background taking video. I also often am frustrated in these movies that characters are too one dimensional and unlikable, but while I was worried about that here as many characters can be over the top, they are all also good, understandable people in the end. The movie clearly has an affection for all the kids in the movie that shines through as the audience has to appreciate them as individuals by the end. If Eighth Grade was the perfect comedic movie for capturing the modern tween experience, Booksmart is a worthy follow up for a raunchier modern high school comedy. A great third act, script, and performance by Dever make Booksmart one of my favorites of the year so far.",Booksmart
77,PyroSikTh,Superbad for 2019!,8,21 December 2019,"I've seen a lot of comparisons to Superbad and, honestly, it's not a bad comparison to make. We follow two high school nerds as they seek out the coolest party in town, ending with surprisingly poignant moments of self-discovery. It even stars Jonah Hill's sister, Beanie Feldstein, and shares Molly Gordon as an antagonist and Will Forte as a father with Good Boys, which was another Superbad-alike released this year. Of course the biggest and most obvious difference to Superbad is that our two nerdy protagonists are female; Molly and Amy. Molly is a high-strung girl who's spent her entire school time trying to eek the most out of it to ensure her future placement in a prestigious college. She comes across as controlling, judgemental, and a know-it-all, and how she can manage that and still be oddly likeable is beyond me. Amy is Molly's best friend and shadow, with lesbian tastes, and is looking forward to escaping to Africa to do charity work. In a single moment of epiphany, they realise they wasted their teenage years studying instead of partying and enjoying life like everyone else they know.Again, much like Superbad, the humour is crude and often sexual in nature. Except of course with female protagonists, it freshens up the approach to that sexual humour, offering a feminine counterpart. Jokes about vaginas, boobs, and lesbianism are abound. But the film's humour doesn't solely rely on these more taboo and risqué topics. There's a trove of comedy to be found in the witty and the slapstick as well. For instance the character of Gigi is a bright beacon of laughs, appearing everywhere and acting so off her tits she's impossible to ever take seriously. Big up to Billie Lourd for absolutely nailing that.But the laughs aren't relentless. Once Molly and Amy finally reach the party, the humour gives way to teenage drama and the film shifts gears into something altogether more serious and thoughtful. While I've seen a lot of praise for this segment, and individually I would agree, it feels like it sticks out in the movie too much. It eases off the laughs a little too much and starts to feel like a completely different movie. I wouldn't say it gets dull, but it started losing me. At least until the party was over and the humour crept back into frame once again, and it started to feel like the same movie we started with. But as I said, individually the party segment is pretty great. This is where the meat of the movie's themes takes place, where characters get fully fleshed out, and we start to see some real magic in Olivia Wilde's direction as well.What sets Booksmart (and Good Boys) apart from Superbad is it's closer adherence to real teenagers. There's no stereotypes here at all. Even the supporting characters get three dimensions imposed on them. The popular jock Nick is not nearly as dumb as he seems, and his interests flirt with the nerdy with an in-depth knowledge of Harry Potter. The Asian kid Tanner still has kind words to say amongst his cruelty towards Molly, and welcomes them both with open arms when they finally arrive. The Hispanic kid Theo is older, having been held back a couple of years, but he made up for it with a proficiency in coding, landing him a job at Google. Jared, the typical rich white kid, spends money desperately trying to be liked, concealing a lonely interior with an interest in planes and musicals. He even hints at a darker and lonelier side to Gigi. Even the school slut Triple A is framed in positivity. She owns her sexual experiences with the pride of any feminist, and shows a much gentler and kinder side than her stereotype would usually allow. And the fact I can write these in-depth, analytical sentences about characters with only a few minutes screentime screams volumes to the quality of the film's writing and respect for its characters.On a more technical level, as I mentioned above, the party segment also allows Olivia Wilde to have a bit more fun, and really flex her directing muscles. Amy's revelation in the pool is extremely well-filmed, almost completely underwater surrounded by bare legs, without spoon-feeding the audience as to who's legs they belong to. Once she gets out of the pool and has her argument with Molly, the camera doesn't cut. In fact the camera lingers on Molly and Amy, with the background sounds turned so far down they don't matter. And yet it still manages to make it obvious when the rest of the party starts paying attention to the argument. But what really impressed me was the argument itself. Both Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie exhibit some fantastic performances here, delivering the heartbreakingly written disagreement that never drifts into cliché. But I particularly liked the camera's focus on the recipient of the shouting, as opposed to, say, Marriage Story which focussed on the pain and anger being delivered through words. Instead Booksmart puts the focus on the reaction, on the effect those angry words have. It became an oddly poignant decision.Yes, what people are saying about Booksmart is true. It's hilarious and quotable like all the best comedies, but it also has its more serious moments as it shifts into teen drama, even outdoing the best of them. It's just a shame that the movie felt like it had to shift so suddenly and drastically to get its point across. The party itself also held potential for some comedy gold, without necessarily taking away from the dramatic moments, and vice versa the earlier moments could quite easily have tapped into the more dramatic moments, marrying the two opposing tones more fluidly. Booksmart almost reaches greatness, but the disparity of tones and pacing prevented it from tipping into that. I give it a hilarious and poignant 8/10. Superbad for 2019.",Booksmart
78,sweidman-28016,Fantastic Comedy Directorial Debut,9,28 May 2019,"Booksmart Review:On the eve of their high school graduation, two academic superstars and best friends realize they should have worked less and played more. Determined not to fall short of their peers, the girls try to cram four years of fun into one night. I've just been excited for this film for a long while. I believe it was at Sundance and that's where I heard about it. I didn't know the plot but just that it was hilarious and a great directorial debut for Olivia Wilde. I thought this was a great comedy and possibly one of the best I've seen. Really it's the script, direction, and performances that blend into a perfect relationship. So the script I thought was creative, hilarious, and I'd say it trying to be relatable which it succeeds in doing. By relatable I mean we can understand these two girls and their motives. Obviously I can't relate with dedicating my time and life to school because that's no fun. The crazy situations they get themselves into were fun to watch. There's one scene in particular that I feel was something they put on a limb. It was strange and felt off but like in a good way. It was hilarious and basically made no sense, yet one of my favorite parts. I think it's just the strange humor that made it enjoyable. Also I believe this film has one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a film and I died of laughter. If you decide to see this I think you'll know. Also this is full of vulgar humor so if you're not into that I doubt you'll have a good time. I don't know much about Olivia Wilde but I think this is an amazing way to start out for a directorial debut. She didn't write the script (screenplay by Katie Silberman) but I'm sure Silberman is proud of how she put her vision on screen. Wilde really made the relationships on screen perfect. She pushed the actors to do their absolute best. Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein had a perfect relationship. They felt like real best friends for many years and it never felt forced. None of the acting felt forced. I think this is the best performances by both of them. I shouldn't think about the Globes yet but it would be great to have one of them in best Actress Comedy/Musical. I think they're hilarious and now I can't see them apart. Just watch the film and it'll all make sense. Also Billie Lourd was absolutely hilarious I never single scene she was in. I've only seen her really in American Horror Story and her small scenes in Star Wars. I'm just so surprised at how funny she is and that she does comedies and not more dramatic performances. I want her on more comedies. For technical aspects there's nothing super noticeable. I did like the score by Dan the Automator. Also the choices of songs I thought were good and set the mood. Now for the problems I had, I remember saying I had 2 1/2 problems but I can't think of the 1 1/2. It was predictable. Had there not been movies with similar situations at parties it wouldn't be too predictable. Rather than deleting what I had before I remember the 1/2 problem. So the only trailer I saw was the red band trailer. And it's not the film's fault but the trailer's. The trailer had all the funny scenes and so I could tell what was going to happen next in a particular scene. It also told the story and that's fine but I wish it didn't tell most of it. Honestly trailers are spoiling films now and it makes me mad but that's a rant for a different time. Overall I think this is an excellent comedy and I would highly recommend Booksmart. (You can watch the first 6 unedited minutes of it on YouTube since Annapurna released it if you'd like a taste of what you'll be watching).My Grade: A-",Booksmart
79,funtasticfour,Somewhat fun but overhyped!,6,7 January 2020,"So many people had this on their best of 2019 lists, of course I had to watch it and see for myself. It's a teen raunchy comedy, and its ok. What sets it apart from others? Well, the main 2 characters are girls, which is probably what all the fuss is about. They do have great chemistry together, and I've heard thats because they were forced to live together for a month. Thats a great idea, and a very good way to have chemistry! That being said, the movie floats around and has some laughs but isn't special in any way. I've watched Kaitlyn Dever for a bit on Last Man Standing where she often has the most laughs, and from there I knew she's have a big future. Then I watched all of Unbelievable this year where she was amazing. She definitely belongs on a list of top actors in 2019 but this movie does not.",Booksmart
80,Offworld_Colony,"Hinges on a great premise,",10,20 February 2020,"Booksmart is a modern high school comedy, a much better, more appropriate and current Superbad. Beanie Feldstein is electric and everybody is an absolute sweetheart. The dialogue and acting, the photography, and especially the music is all on point. Olivia Wilde has managed to make a fresh picture with her own voice and variety and yet with a retro vibe. It's raw and forward and it plays with expectations of the cliches of this genre, often having its cake and eating it as the girls pick up anecdotes and jokes on their one night odyssey. Also the film is genuinely sexy.",Booksmart

82,PedroPires90,"Avoid to offend anyone, not that funny",6,29 April 2021,"Well...the film is not as smart as it thinks it is, but obviously the aesthetics, the gimmicks and the social relevance brought by Olivia were enough to convince almost all the critics. Or maybe it was the several liberal references. I hope it was not that because your politics shouldn't change the way you watch a movie, much less the way you review it. But, unfortunately, it's a tendency. And I'm saying this as a leftist.There are a few funny moments, but can people honestly say that this was funnier than some of those so-called ""stupid comedies"" from the past (American Pie, Road Trip, Superbad...)? It's predictable, the acting is not that convincing (lol what the hell was that GG nod for a clearly absurd and unrealistically overacted performance) and doesn't do anything new, with the exact same clichés and structure we have seen several times. Just an average teen comedy, that avoid (at all means) to offend anyone in these times, one or two good lines and an apparent representation (even if some characters are there more like tokens than any other thing).I know a lot of people feel offended by a specific kind of comedy, but honestly a good comedy should make you laugh above everything.

83,theknownames,Expectations,9,20 June 2019,"I immediately lower my expectations when hype drives me to movie. If I had stumbled onto this I would have been so pleasantly surprised. I think because it reminded people of older movies like Juno or Superbad it's being held to a standard that it shouldn't be. It's none of those things and doesn't claim to be. It's not a big budget shock comedy its sweet, nostalgic , entertaining , has decent soundtrack and likable characters.
I get why early viewers wanted to let the world know with high ratings and then ,as usual , others came along ready to pick it apart , time will tell. It's a solid 8 in my book but had I seen it when it first came out rather than literally waiting until the last night it was playing, I may have rated it a 9 . All these 1 , 2 and 3 ratings really ? Really? You would give this a 1? This is a movie review site and I am a supposed to trust your judgment with 1's?

84,bbewnylorac,Not a bad effort,7,27 July 2019,"It's very refreshing for a teen movie to be written and directed by women, and to have females as its two main leads. It's also nice that, as best friends Molly and Amy, Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever play intelligent, studious nerds, and not airhead bimbos. Molly, however, is not a shrinking violet, and when she decides she will spend the night before graduation partying for once, she convinces the much more introverted Amy to come with her to a classmate's mega party. The mayhem that ensues is interesting enough but it's not mind blowing. The script doesn't snap and crackle. The plot isn't amazing. The music and set design are great. The actors are great, too, including Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd in a very fun part as wild and enigmatic party girl Gigi. It's interesting that the writers don't demonise any of the characters. The class lothario and the class rich kid just want to be liked. It's also refreshing that Molly's and Amy's hopes for the night don't end up exactly as they wanted. This is far from the best teen movie ever - that level is occupied with classics like Bring It On, Clueless and 10 Things I Hate About You - but it's not the worst by any means.",Booksmart
85,ethanbresnett,Really fun - but the Superbad similarities are often rather glaring,8,11 March 2020,"I will say I expected slightly more from Booksmart, with it featuring in quite a few people's top 10s of 2019. What was most disappointing for me was the numerous similarities to Superbad.Two nerdy high school best friends attempt to redefine their image through a party. They struggle to get to the party. There's a run in with the cops, an argument between the two friends (specifically about their future plans after school), and ultimately a resolution between the friends .Am I describing Superbad or Booksmart?Don't get me wrong this isn't a major criticism of the film. Superbad is perhaps the best teen comedy of all time, so any other coming of age comedy will likely live in its shadow, and comparisons will inevitably be drawn.There were several points where I felt the film dragging, most notably before they arrived at the party having decided to go. In addition the humour didn't always hit the right notes for me. It was never bad just not sometimes my cup of tea. Humour is very personal though so I'm not counting that against Booksmart too much.What really makes this film shine are the two central characters. They were just fun people spend an hour and a half with, very well written and well thought out. The chemistry between Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever was really enjoyable and believable, carrying the film strongly.Overall Booksmart is a very enjoyable comedy, a heartwarming and funny insight into teen friendship, and refreshing to see a story like this told from a positive female lens (in a somewhat Bridesmaids ish way). Definitely worth watching and easily one of the best comedies of recent years!",Booksmart
86,ofumalow,I don't get it,5,15 May 2019,"Of course, as usual the ten-star advance ""user reviews"" here are from people who ""mysteriously"" have never written an IMBD review before--i.e. studio shills. But ""Booksmart"" has gotten great early reviews, and several people I know who saw early screenings really did love it. So I went in fully expecting to enjoy it, and was dismayed when immediately--I mean, even before the opening title--the film was making ""Funny, huh? Wasn't that funny?!?"" noises despite nothing particularly funny happening. I'll give Olivia Wilde points for making a very colorful and energetic movie that might indeed convince a lot of people through sheer high spirits that it's a great comedy. But instead it felt just strenuous to me, trying too hard to cover the fact that the funny, clever, witty material wasn't actually there.The premise is ridiculous--bookworm protagonists are horrified to discover that after all their sacrifices for the future, all the party-hearty types at their high school ALSO got into Ivy League schools. This would make sense if it took place in a wealthy community where everyone was a ""legacy"" student thanks for their family's donations. But the movie makes a point of singling out two characters as the only ""truly rich"" ones here. Those two, like every character save the two lead girls, are complete ""SNL""-style caricatures. What's worse, they all also seem to be played by actors who are about a decade too old, once again apart from the two lead girls.Even so, the premise and the casting and everything might have worked if ""Booksmart"" were an outright farce. But it seems to be aiming to be sorta-kinda ""real,"" while the characters nonetheless behave like no teenagers past or present. Everything here is so over-amped and contrived for effect, yet the ingenious comedy situations and bright lines that approach might have served are nowhere to be found.Like I said, I don't get it--it's a very lively and well-crafted movie that nonetheless felt completely phony and unfunny to be. It's not boring, but I have no idea what people who like it are responding to, beyond the fact that ""'Superbad' for high school senior girls"" is probably good enough for many. But I liked ""Superbad"" well enough, and this movie just did nothing for me. You could say it aims for a mix of ""Superbad"" and John Hughes, but those movies do a much better job turning recognizable teenage life into farce with some heart, and if Wilde intended something similar (I'm not sure what she intended, beyond punching across every scene as if she might never be allowed to direct again), she misses the mark. A for effort, C for derivative/uninspired content, and D for over-effortfully trying to hide that empty content. It's like a student paper with a very splashy cover but nothing original or thoughtful inside.",Booksmart
87,joelwatchesmovies,Great direction and a great cast capitalize on the poignant high school ensemble script,8,5 June 2019,Feels a little contrived as it sets itself up but the payoff is well worth it: the oddball central duo have great chemistry (see their mutual flattering outside the party) and the rest of the diverse character ensemble all have their moments and even arcs (see Jared's tear-jerking vulnerability). Good writing is made even better by stellar direction: Wilde's theatrical flair (see the ceremony entrance) and excellent use of music perfectly capture the extreme drama and emotion of teen life.,Booksmart

Upon the eve of graduation, they suddenly realise the fun they've missed out on with parties and go on a mission to explore four years worth of wreckless abandon in one night! What makes this one instantly warm feeling is the truly lovely performances from all involved, real star making roles for Feldstein and Dever who have most certainly got a bright future ahead; their chemistry is insanely good and shines off the screen. Every single performance surrounding the two great central ones are brilliant too; Skyler Gisondo as Jared is hilarious! Diana Silvers is amazing as Hope; a character whose layers are revealed really effectively. Miss Fine is a great character played by the super cool Jessica Williams. Billie Lourd is so good as Gigi; a party animal who is almost like the overseer of all the parties happening in the neighbourhood. I could talk for ages about the performances but there's too much to say for one post! It's the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy, Drinking Buddies) who takes an already clever and funny script by Susanna Fogel and Katie Silberman and passionately visualises the whole story through the eyes of two best friends. Being an accomplished actress herself, she of course understands performance and when an actor steps behind the camera, you relax in a pair of hands that know how to get the best out of the cast and the same can absolutely be said here. It was a really refreshing quality to see sexuality explored in such an open and honest way as well; there's a scene involving the first time between two characters that is really beautifully done and encapsulates the tender awkwardness of a first sexual encounter. I was wonderfully affected by its vibrant projection of what it feels like to be young",Booksmart

I think that this movie was written for those of us girls who felt awkward & shy & really had a tough time fitting in at school. The story emotionally grabbed hold of me & I intensely watched to see how they would get thru different scenarios. I loved finding myself emotionally relating to these two. I watched them experience their first time at a popular party & I felt just like they did. I never really wanted to go to parties but wanted the experience & wanted to be invited just like they did when I was in high school. I cracked up at the smaller girl's dry sense of humor. The high school kids were all quirky & brought back memories of all the weirdos I went to school with. It's definitely a chick flick. I really really liked this movie. I think any girl who wants a nice quiet funny film that will bring back memories of high school & the first close girl friend you hung with will love this.

95,movieman6-413-929510,Olivia Wilde does a good job with her first director's work.,7,26 May 2019,"Booksmart is a new comedy directed by Olivia Wilde. This is the first cinema film she has directed. For this she has only directed some short music videos. She is also known as an actress.The film is about the two best friends and fellow students Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (Beanie Feldstein). The two have behaved nicely throughout their high school period, done their homework and achieved good grades. For example, they expect that they can come to better universities compared to the rest of their classmates.
When they later learn that their classmates also qualify for these universities without having had such neat school lives in high school, the two realize that they have missed many parties unnecessarily. They have one evening before their graduation ceremony and decide to do as many wrong and festive things as possible in this one evening to still experience the missed opportunities.With this comedy in which the characters develop to go from high school to university, Olivia Wilde gets a chance to present her first directed cinema film from different angles. In this way she has had the opportunity to visualize different genres such as comedy, drama and even animation.In many situations or introductions of new characters, a modern pop music song is played to indicate the atmosphere of the situation or the personality of the character extra clearly. At the first few times this helps viewers to further explain the situation or to understand what kind of new character they are being introduced to, but if this happens again in the movie for the umpteenth time, it will be a bit unnecessary and too repeatedly.The two main characters appear realistic as best friends. It is nice to see how the characters experience new situations and activities and learn from them. They also look good as high school students, but sometimes their characters and their actions are a bit too exaggerated or written.",Booksmart

Having said that, there's nothing original about the plot, this storyline of a 'night of chaos' has actually been overdone so many times.

99,patriciogl10,"What a miss, since there isn't much to it.",5,27 November 2019,"Frankly, Booksmart succeeded in entertaining at first superficial glance. However I don't believe it is actually all that funny; I found myself chuckling a few times, but that is hardly enough, if not a tad sad. The acting is a major problem, as none of the protagonists seem to know how to convey or deliver anything funny. The story is enjoyable enough to carry you through it, but this is supposed to be a comedy. Beanie Feldstein (had to learn her name) is so particularly exasperating that I thought of poking my eyes out during the many tiresome interventions she has.
I embrace Kaitlyn Denver's Amy because she has some depth, a more serious attitude to her character that makes her more appealing and relatable.
She's one of the few acceptable things we can salvage from this otherwise insufficent effort. Skyler Gisondo plays the goofy flashy fella desperate to be popular who wants to be accepted for being anyone rather than himself. There's also some profoundness to be found in his character, which you didn't expect to find in such a ridiculous portrayal (done right, I might add), so the plot unexpectedly turns to focus a bit on him, to show a different side of these people, who are not always the way they show themselves.Olivia Wilde did a fairly good job from the director's chair, Booksmart is ultimately a story made for those underdogs that don't want to be seen or rather want to be seen for whom the rich and popular want them to be, or in this particular case, how the underdog mistakenly thinks it's cool.
I couldn't quite understand the motivation most of these teenagers have with partying all day and getting mind-numbingly drunk just to 'have fun'. We have seen these oversimplified formulaic takes on huge parties that seem to get crazier and more unrealistic with each movie. I'm not sure if actual booksmarts would even be interested in these overrated social conventions, I don't understand a character like Molly, in fact I thoroughly dislike a character like Molly, and I find the actress' portrayal utterly abysmal.As you can read from my review, this film hasn't got much to provide for your cinematic pleasure, but you can still make the obnoxious effort to sit though this unfunny yet slightly entertaining feature.

100,thenolanfan,Review - Booksmart,5,22 June 2021,"Many like me won't be able to follow the film's pacing. Booksmart is a supercharged coming-to-age film filled with so many themes, tropes, and jokes that it is hard to follow.Olivia Wilde is overdoing it. Her directing style is, despite appearances, pretty conventional, but it appears unconventional because it is overstated. It doesn't hide the film's themes, instead, it lessens their impact. Honestly, the screenplay played a part in this issue, it is too dense, and the pacing, as I said in the intro, is inappropriate considering the film's runtime. In brief, Booksmart is flawed at a different level of filmmaking for making little use of cinema's capability as a distinct medium.There are some things that Book Smart does right though, at least in the acting aspect... Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein insufflate energy and confidence in their roles for their characters to feel different from the nerds you actually see in coming-to-age films. It is also the vehicle for the film's greatest gags.",Booksmart

This authentic (if comedically heightened) reenactment of teenage angst and intrigue during the final days of high school is funny whilst emotionally engaging. Future stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein are inimitable, backed by great casting throughout and clever song and shot selection.As the two girls realise they've spurned their youth studying, they decide to enjoy their final hours as teenagers, attending a party to signify their transition to college. This starts the city-spanning journey of the night, ranging from boat parties to attempted kidnapping.The music in this film is stupidly good. So many songs so carefully selected for every scene is a rarity, and it does ""Booksmart"" no harm to knock the music out the park. The shots are also deceptively good - a lot of intelligent slo-mo and colour is a good way to go for a comedy.Yes, there is a stylistic and comedic angle that not everyone will click with, but I would still say ""Booksmart"" is one of the better teen flicks out there today.

All the other characters are mostly weak and don't offer anything memorable. Nothing to me made it stand out from your
average teen girl Comedy movie. It's predictable, cliche, vulgar, and just plain dumb.The acting is fine, the production values are decent for what it is, but my god the use of music got irritating in places. It follows the typical Coming-Of-Age teenage girl friendship stuff and I just didn't care by the end of it because I did not like these characters at all.

107,peeedeee-94281,Booksmart is not comedysmart,5,31 May 2019,"I'll give Olivia Wilde points for the cinematography, editing, and pacing of the film. I think as a first time director, she did a much better job than, say, a veteran like Steve McQueen who did a horrible job with Widows. But I digress, this movie intrigued me because of the high Rotten Tomatoes. But after watching it, it feels like Critics patting industry favourites on the back, or someone got kickbacks to give it such a high rating.
The main thing wrong about this film is that it's not that funny. It's a comedy with bad comic timing, and no comic energy. There are a few moments that make you giggle, like the pornographic audio on the car stereo, which I totally saw coming. But otherwise, most of the sight gags, or one-liners, just fell flat.
People are saying well it's more of a drama than a comedy to explain this away. No, it was meant to be a COMEDY. It's quite clear. But it just isn't funny.
Another bad thing was the characters. They were either very one dimensional, or you didn't know enough about them to feel anything for them. I feel a good teen angst movie should have characters that make you empathize with them, so you hope they make it in the end. I didn't feel anything for the characters, I didn't care either way whether they made it to THE party or if they connected with whatever love interest.
So while this isn't anywhere near Super Bad or a John Hughes movie, it does look good, and might be a good movie to sit through on a rainy afternoon.
Oh yeah, if you're offended by lots of gay references, or same sex making out, you may want to avoid this.

The movie fit most of the requirements needed for a good comedy: appealing leads, unique and quirky comedy situations, fresh dialogue, and a memorable ending.
The thing I think people will have a problem with is that adults, even young ones, might have some trouble getting comfortable with the humor, dialogue, and even some of the scenes (the teenage sex scene in the bathroom made me pretty uncomfortable...)

I didn't have major fun, but I least had some. Laughed hear and there and enjoyed pretty much every scene. The acting is decent, not bad & congrats for that, movie producers.

113,Padreviews,Orange is the only fruit,8,11 June 2019,"I had heard good things about this movie and was expecting it to be really good .The first half was quite a disappointment to be honest and I expected to be walking out not liking it at all .But the second half was so powerful it really brought the film up to a higher level . I wouldn't describe this as comedy it's not another American Pie or anything like that .It's drama , it's about friendship , love , desire , failure and success . It's about reckoning , it's about love for friends and possibly more - it's about coming out and discovery of sexuality and repression.It has a great script , colourful characters and some future superstars in Bernie Feldstein playing an almost Muriel's wedding type role where she is able to overcome bullying through her confidence. Another huge star in the making not least for her model like looks ( Hollywood still works that way sadly ) is the lesbian interest Diana Silvers ( looking at lot like Emily Ratajkowski fresh from staring in the not so good Ma (2019)If you find yourself like I did in the first half thinking what is this ? Stay for the second half it's worth it - some powerful drama - almost tearful - and a happy ending - happier than it could have been .EnjoyPad.A 8/10",Booksmart

2) There are lots of long takes and tracking shots which shows good direction and cinematography
3) The emotional moment when Amy sees her crush get with someone else and then argues with Molly is good, but it's the only emotional momentNEGATIVES:1) The film is basically just a 1hr 45 min music video: SO MANY SONGS
2) The idea that the chubby nerd would stand any chance with the popular jock is frankly just a feminist dream and a flat out lie
3) Their principal is an Uber driver and their teacher gives out her phone number and shows up to their party and maybe hooks up with one of the students?!?!

I think it's a very well-paced comedy, the dialogue is dynamic and funny, and pretty much every single joke lands. The only real issues I had with this film were its 'MTV show' moments. It feels like there's a song playing over the film every 5 minutes, but it does help that a majority of those songs were, in my opinion, pretty great. Other than that, Booksmart pretty much nailed it.A huge amount of people are comparing it to Superbad, and I do get why they're doing that. I recognize that they do seem to have a lot of similarities, but I think their tones are completely different.I don't think Booksmart is a good comedy because of its Superbad similarities and how aware it is of the generation it's portraying and presenting itself to. I think Booksmart is a great comedy because it was able to feel very much like its own thing despite of its Superbad similarities and how aware it is of the generation it's portraying and presenting itself to.

118,plasticanimalz,Decent For A First Time Director But Fell Short,6,15 October 2019,"The trailer promised hilarious and what I got instead was a mildly amusing film but not much else. It had some good moments...but, was nothing special, certainly not anything I haven't seen repeatedly, with the exception it's girls in the roles usually played by hapless guys trying to fit in. The two leads were very likable, had great chemistry, and I enjoyed their improving. Billie Lourde was great. That part was kind of funny. She wasn't a particularly original character but the fact she kept showing up everywhere was kind of funny. It became predictable, but still funny. Other than that, there wasn't a whole lot going on. It's the same old paint-by-number teen film we've seen a jillion time about the unpopular kids trying to go to a party and finding the person of their dreams. And that can be fine, it just didn't add anything new other than one of the girls was a lesbian, and, if you want to see something along those lines, Love, Simon is a much better choice. It's about a gay teen and not a lesbian, but a good movie is a good movie, and that one was miles better.Basically, all you have here is a pitch meeting where they said, ""We'll make Superbad, but with two girl leads, and diversity,"" and that was that, then they cut and paste that film, along with scenes from Can't Hardly Wait, and the writers thought their comedic wit would be enough, but they're not nearly as funny as they think they are, so, it fell flat. I'm not just blaming the writers, Olivia Wilde is also green as a director, so she couldn't champion the ship in the way the two leads and some of the other actors deserved, and she couldn't tell a mediocre script when she had one. Because Olivia is an actor, the acting itself was very good as was the casting. Everyone was able to hold their own, the story just wasn't great and it was so unbelievable as a high school.The thing that sells a memorable teen movie is that kids can identify it as the experience they are going through, or as an adult have nostalgia about what high school was like. Weird Science or Ferris Bueller, while over-the-top, it's basically a kid's fantasy of reality. Superbad is still a fantasy, as there's no way Jonah Hill and Michael Cera end up with Emma Stone and the other girl, but other than that it's fairly real. In Booksmart it's clear that Olivia Wilde hasn't been to high school in a long time and doesn't have teenagers because I found it more a fantasy high school and pretty unrealistic, which made it hard to connect with anyone. We've all felt like the nerds at some point in our life, like the two main characters, but the high school world they lived in I just don't think exists anywhere, so, it was hard for me to accept the story they were trying to tell, which, frankly, was kind of boring and slow, with some amusing or mildly cute moments.Maybe they were trying to tell too many stories, and so failed to tell one good one. Though, Can't Hardly Wait told several stories and that was a great teen movie. So, maybe they were trying to tell too many stories of too many teens, while in the hands of writers and a director that wasn't capable of that. Also, everything was too on 10. They tried too hard to make everyone so whacky, it just didn't have enough dimension. Like, I liked the gay theatre guys, I liked the rich kid who tried too hard, but, a lot of these vignettes just seemed like the girls moving from one whacky moment to the next with no real cohesion. It was all kind of aimless with a lot of stuff happening. And, where do these girls live? Other than the lead girls, everyone at their school seems to be crazy rich, which, I don't think too many kids can identify with.I wouldn't say to avoid this film, I would just say lower your expectations from the trailer. I think if they would have been more genuine about what they were selling they would get the audience based on the story of the two girls alone. From a first-time director, it's decent, and a good start. Ben Affleck's first film got a lot of praise but I don't think anyone actually enjoyed it, as it was pretty mediocre and not great directing. I would say Booksmart was better than Gone Girl, so, Olivia Wilde has room to improve, and it was a decent first film, just didn't live up to expectations.",Booksmart
119,Jamie_Seaton,Tedious,3,25 May 2019,"The film does pick up in its 2nd half but by that time I built up too much hatred for it. It's noisy, characters are annoying plus a full deck of cliche's.

121,calspers,Creative style hidden in cheap script,6,1 September 2019,"""Booksmart"" directed by Olivia Wilde is about two straight-A high school seniors that seek out a night of fun before graduation. That is the basic and banal plot of this film. The lacking plot or story is compensated for through a load of sexual humour and references, as well as numerous montages that attempt to fill this obvious void of the film. For its entertainment purposes, it kind of works.In spite, I was not impressed with the film. I have to give the film - it being a comedy - credit for making me laugh a couple of times in a stylish way - and I liked the performance by Beanie Feldstein as Molly.Other than that, I felt ""Booksmart"" was close to copying ""Super Bad"" on several levels, but a less successful result.

123,torrascotia,A Girl Focused Buddy Movie With A Hip Hop Soundtrack.,7,30 May 2019,"There are movies which are female led which mainly appeal to females only. While its all well and good that female friendly films are made it doesn't do much for their overall appeal when they deliberately shun the guys.
Luckily this isn't one of them.
This is a teenage party movie in the same vein as Superbad but without the gross out humour.
Its also a nerd movie, a genre which was popular in the 80s with the Revenge Of The Nerds series and more recently with the Big Bang Theory, the twist here is that its female nerds. So far so 2019. The story is that the two protagonists are obsessive study types who have shunned partying to get into the best schools. They enjoy looking down their noses as the rest of their party hard classmates due to their mistaken belief their party lifestyle means they didn't get into the good colleges. It doesn't.
The protagonists fear of missing out drives them to attend the biggest party in the school before college and that is where the bulk of the action is.
This is a movie which will appeal to teens and adults alike due to the humour and the smart writing.
Its not overly hip so that it feels inaccessible to an older audience. But it will certainly appeal to a teenage market who will likely feel the movie is all about them.
The film is held together by the relationships between the many characters who are very believable and the acting is great.
I would also like to mention the soundtrack which was put together by Dan The Automator, a well know independent producer known for Hip Hop.
I would recommend this if you enjoy those crazy party movies regardless of age or gender.
Its one of the better movies of 2019.",Booksmart
124,rmmil,Good but not great,5,6 October 2021,"I feel like this film was a victim of its own expectations.The story is similar enough to ""Superbad"" to warrant parallels, you can tell this was Hollywood's next big attempt to make the ""teenage girl coming of age story"", but I feel like it suffered with its pacing and casting, compared to that film, and the end result was lackluster.It's so obvious what they were trying to do here, even casting Jonah Hill's sister in the lead role (Superbad!).The story is simple: A couple of girls want to attend the party that (they are sure) will change their lives forever. But then, ""stuff happens"", and it's difficult for them to get to the party.What other film does that sound like to you, hmm?Ultimately, though, I think this film vastly underperformed at the box office because it had all the ""parts"" of a successful teenage story, but the film itself just wasn't that funny. The jokes fell flat. It just didn't spark any real reaction out of me when I saw it, one way or another.Meh.",Booksmart

But for everyone else it is a useful term so... This is a comedy, farcical, 'coming of age' movie for teenage girls. Emotions float around overt excitement, occasional depressive slump and rarely anything between. The target audience were hugging themselves with empathetic glee. Everyone else was just glad that's all over.I did agonise over the score because this really hits the mark for teenagers. For this movie (like the opinion of most teenagers) I am almost irrelevant.

130,nikitalinivenko,Chick version of Superbad,6,24 October 2020,"I've noticed there's a certain type of movie: You get a big dumb bro movie, followed by the occasional female remake that just might sometimes outdo it. What Ms. 45 was to Death Wish, or Thelma and Louise was to Midnight Run, Booksmart is to Superbad (with light shades of Dazed and Confused dusted over it). Two repressed besties decide to cut loose and go partying. That's pretty much it. Though the movie takes a dip in the slightly latter half, it was engaging enough for about two-thirds of it, carried by an ensemble of (refreshingly distinct) characters, each one memorable and with their own personality (I especially liked Billie Lourd's character, the drugged-out bimbo who teleports from party to party, and the gay drama geek in spectacles). The script was pretty damn sharp and the character interactions all worked perfectly. Apart from that, there isn't anything particularly new or exciting here, just a slight update of Superbad that was better than expected.",Booksmart
131,Camoo,Kind of overrated but has its great moments,7,26 June 2019,"Booksmart had me in the theater for the first time in months - no small task. What I had been sorely missing recently was being in a theater with people who are all laughing together, so I wanted to give this film a shot, and its insanely great reviews had me in. Now that I've seen it I have mixed feelings about it. I want to champion a film like this, its newcomers, its behind the scenes talent in directing and writing. But when I'm honest with myself - it doesn't come close to the riotous euphoria of a film like 'Superbad' or other comedies it is being compared to.The two lead actresses are really stellar. I cannot even name them off the top of my head because I have never seen either of them, but I do hope to see them again. As a film about friendship full of great chemistry, it works wonderfully. Where it falters for me is its side characters, who were drawn so comically and outlandishly, that the purpose of its plot (that some of these characters have a chance at love with one another) ends up working against itself. What I enjoyed the most was its overall intelligence, the relationship between the two leads, and in its more challenging and important subject matter. A flat out comedy featuring a lesbian high schooler is a rare thing indeed, and I appreciated that Booksmart avoided typical cliches about homophobia and tolerance around sexual identity - we are in 2019, and people just accept these things about one another. The warm embrace of a sexual identity at this age in this sort of film is striking.It has its great moments, particularly the opening dance number, which set a standard which is not entirely met throughout the film, and I genuinely laughed at some points, but I was not on the floor, sides splitting like I had hoped. Perhaps it has to do with how damn nice these girls are, and how nice everybody is overall - none of the characters exudes the kind of dark angry genius Jonah Hill displayed in Superbad, and perhaps that is the point. Stay smart, stay kind, stay open.EDIT: There is obviously some campaign going on to smear this movie.. The IMDB reviews have been filled with hate, often by reviewers who have only the 1 review to their name. I have no bias when I write my reviews. Screw the internet. Good, smart, small movies need to be championed and this is one of them even if it wasn't really to my taste.",Booksmart

I guess my problem with this film was that I really didn't care for the 2 leads here, thought they were trying so hard to become their respective characters and all I saw was Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein yelling at eachother continously.

134,domtaylor,It's extremely entertaining.,8,7 September 2019,"'Booksmart' is supremely enjoyable throughout. While it's not laugh-out-loud funny all the time, (although there are a few times where it warrants more than a chuckle) it's always fun thanks to a witty script and excellent performances from all of the cast. Although this is undeniably about Diever and Feldstein's characters and their friendship, which is satisfyingly developed throughout, every supporting player truly feels like a real person with their own fleshed-out personality. This really helps make the picture feel much more believable, no matter how outlandish it gets, and keeps a firm grasp on character without letting the comedy surpass it in importance. While it can be rather predictable, this never seems like much of a problem because of the very 21st century spin on the world and characters that makes the whole affair feel rather fresh. Olivia Wilde realises this diegesis and its characters so successfully that it's impressive to know that it's her first feature as director. Overall, it's certainly worth watching if you're into coming of age dramas and teen comedies, especially if you want to see an example that feels like it belongs in 2019 and isn't afraid to balance character and comedy. It aces it. 8/10",Booksmart

Overall it is a very good coming of age film, and a particularly great directorial debut for Olivia Wilde, but there have been at least 2-4 other coming of age films made in the last 5-7 years (The Spectacular Now, The Edge of Seventeen, Perks of Being a Wallflower, and The Kings of Summer) that have way more solid footing. The biggest difference regarding ""Booksmart"" is that it is first and foremost a comedy while those other handful of films I mentioned certainly have laugh out loud moments but lean more toward drama.""Booksmart"" allows Dever to show off her fantastic comedic timing and sass (that she was known for doing in Last Man Standing) which is refreshing to see in a movie layout. Beanie Feldstein holds her own as well easily keeping up with Dever and having her own strong moments as well. Gisondo does what he was liked for doing in Santa Clarita Diet, playing the cute but incredibly awkward and nerdy boy (this time with a rich, desperate twist) and shows a lot of promise even if he is being typecast.The movie itself, I'll admit, had me laughing out loud plenty, but let me bring all the folks rating this a perfect score down to earth a bit because the excitement is over-the-top, like the amount of scenes in which Wilde induces us with slow-motion + rap/pop music. This film is more like Superbad than Perks of Being a Wallflower. Is that bad? Absolutely not. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but let's not get carried away claiming ""Booksmart"" is the best of it's genre. It's strong but certainly flawed. The sorority-sisterhood in this works and so does most of the comedy, to Wilde's credit she knows when to stop the jokes before they get sloppy and in the way.Solid comedy with a good directorial debut from Wilde and good comedic performances by Dever, Feldstein and Gisondo.",Booksmart

141,cappiethadog,Don't need a gun,9,26 September 2019,"The cool kids tyrannize the uncool kids, that's the bread and butter for all movies set at a high school. Where are the football players smearing deep-healing ointment on the smaller teammate's jockstrap? Where are the cheerleaders chanting: ""Plug it up! Plug it up!"" to a young girl menstruating in the shower? High school as utopia, that's the concept of Olivia Wilde's ""Booksmart"", a scholastic haven where Lucas(Corey Haim) and Carrie(Sissy Spacek) would be safe. Jocks, especially football players in letterman jackets, don't rule this school. Molly Davidson(Beanie Feldstein), class president, wouldn't allow that to happen, not on her watch. The nerds are safe. She is one of them. Amy(Kaitlyn Dever), too, her best friend. The nerd is the mean girl. Molly, a classic overachiever, treats her classmates with contempt. The school president has the brains, but neither the body nor the looks, or even the parental love of her counterpart, Diane Court(Ione Skye). Wilde references Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"" when Molly tells Amy to ""...go back,"" and continue her conversation with Ryan(Victoria Rusega), the sidekick's secret crush. Diane had the unconditional support of her father(John Mahoney), whereas Molly, established in the opening scene, has motivational speakers on tape as mom and dad proxies. On her bedroom wall, a banner reads: ""Take no prisoners."" Molly is an assassin; her brain is the weapon. That killer mentality comes in handy when she overhears people deconstructing her from a unisex bathroom stall. Although Molly rules this school, at the end of the day, she is still the fat girl. The fat girl, however, possesses a superpower; she's good at ""mo**********' homework"". A scholarship to Yale acts as her shield against derogatory comments. Molly fights back. Because her classmates are party animals, she stereotypes them as losers and burnouts. Molly tells them, point blank, that they have no future. She heads triumphantly towards the loo door before ""Triple A""(Molly Gordon) throws a metaphorical water balloon at this New Haven-bound girl. Like a splash of cold water in her face, Molly learns that Annabelle also has the cachet of being an incoming Yale freshman. Tanner(Nico Hiraga), the token ""football"" player, is going to Stanford on a soccer scholarship. The stoner(Eduardo Franco), got recruited by Google as a coder. The cool kids win again. The cool kids don't just play hard in ""Booksmart"", they study hard, too. Molly's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fantasy goes up in flames. Being booksmart was all that Molly had going for her. It gets worse. Nick(Mason Gooding), the VP, hanging out at his locker, described by Molly as ""hopeless"", was accepted by Georgetown. This time, the overachiever literally gets splashed with cold water. She's collateral damage. The school bestows a reserved parking space for the class president, even her own outdoor table during lunchtime, away from the riff-raff. Now, when it's too late, Molly learns that she's not above water balloon fights in the hallway. Even Gigi(Billie Lourd) turns out to be a formidable opponent. Harvard was her fifth choice. Molly and Amy ate alone because they had no choice. They were the ostracized, not the ostracizers. Nobody invites them to Nick's graduation party. Diane Court had Lloyd Dobler(John Cusack) as a patron. The class valedictorian has a list of phone numbers logged into her cell, but they're acquaintances, not friends. Her calls go unanswered. Amy uses the excuse: ""They probably think they're calling about school stuff,"" because the truth hurts. Instead of a gun shop, the girls go to the library, because they're booksmart, not street smart.Discarded clothes, men's and women's, drape over the croquet set, under moonlight, debauching a well-manicured lawn. Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder), an adjunct member of her school's most powerful clique, tells J.D.(Christian Slater), clad in a black trench coat, her most intimate secret; she's booksmart. Veronica was supposed to skip three grades, but her parents wanted their bright daughter to have normal friends and enrolled the brainiac in a public high school. Not wanting to be outed as an intellectual, Veronica goes incognito, playacting as the ""popular girl"", because nobody wants to be a social pariah, the geek. Veronica ditches her oldest and dearest friend Betty Finn(Renee Estevez) for Heather Chandler(Kim Walker), because being both the smartest person in the room and scholastically relevant, were worlds apart at a school like Westerberg High. A jock, a brain, a pothead, a Goth, and the queen bee wouldn't be caught dead sitting together in the cafeteria during lunch. ""Heathers"", directed by Michael Lehmann, suggests ""The Breakfast Club"", that disparate group of kids who find common ground while serving Saturday detention on library detail in John Hughes' epoch-making film, reverting back to their old selves come Monday morning. Andrew(Emilio Estevez), a wrestler, would be sitting in the jocks' enclave with football players Kurt(Lance Fenton) and Ram(Patrick Labyorteaux), the most toxic of cafeteria cul-de-sacs. Brian(Anthony Michael Hall), the geek; he'd be co-piloting the food drive table with Peter(Jeremy Applegate). John(Judd Nelson), the burnout, would be outside the cafeteria with the other burnouts. Allison(Ally Sheedy), the Goth, however, who received a makeover from Claire(Molly Ringwald), the popular girl, bears a striking resemblance to the manufactured friendship that exists between Veronica Sawyer and Heather Chandler. ""You were nothing before you met me. You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn."" Call them ""The Power Lunch Club"".Unlike the subordinate Heathers(Lisanne Falk & Shannen Doherty), Veronica doesn't abuse the privileges that come with being popular. She does follow orders, though. Despite her protestations, Veronica caves in to the arch-Heather's demand to fool Martha ""Dumptruck""(Carrie Lynn) with a forged love letter from Ram. Veronica doesn't join the chorus of laughter when Martha recognizes the letter as a prank too late, and yet, despite her reservations about bullying the obese girl, she remains Heather Chandler's loyal soldier. Lehmann, as a writer, didn't get the cause and effect right, but the imperfect oracle was six degrees of ""breaking news"". In one chilling scene, we get a tight shot of Martha at the gym, sipping a large-sized soft drink, seemingly watching a basketball game alongside her peers. In the next shot, the camera goes wide, revealing that Martha is alone. The roar of the crowd was canned. The hunted becomes the hunter, that's the connection ""Heather"" misses. Instead of being a copycat shooter, Martha tries to be a copycat suicide. She steps off the curb into moving traffic, because in death, she'll be part of a clique, at long last, whose members are Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelley, and Ram Stevenson, Westerberg's finest. Martha is unaware that her tormentors were murdered. At Heather Chandler's funeral, quite pointedly, Veronica apologizes to God, not her BFF. Although Heather's murder wasn't premeditated, Veronica knowingly allowed her ""best friend"" to drink J.D.'s hangover cure, a cup of blue liquid, unadulterated drain cleaner. ""I just want my high school to be a nice place,"" Veronica tells God. The controversial 1988 film anticipated the high school as slaughterhouse, but the person who pulls the trigger is what ""Heathers"" gets wrong. These days, the alienated teenager does his own shooting. J.D. and Veronica act on Martha Dunnstock's behalf. At the double funeral for Kurt and Ram, Veronica drops the pretense of being sad, laughing openly during a father's eulogy for his dead quarterback son. The school, indeed, becomes nicer. Westerberg's three cruelest students are history. But just like any authoritarian country or institution, when the despot's head gets cut off, another one sprouts up in its place. Heather Duke(Shannen Doherty) carries on where Heather Chandler left off.As aforementioned, Molly and Amy are not street smart. The uber-nerds shake down a pizza delivery guy, a wanted serial killer, as it turns out. They figure out, because they're booksmart, that Pat(Mike O'Brien) knows the address to Nick's graduation party. They attempt an unarmed robbery of Lido Pizza's intellectual property. Initially rattled, the pizza delivery guy takes a closer look at his attackers in the backseat. They're children. The serial killer should be angry, but in the two girls he sees himself at their tender age, and does some quick mentoring instead of killing. ""Did the possibility of sexual assault ever enter your minds?"" he asks incredulously. Unlike the shooters in Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"", Pat knows which types were his enemies at high school. Michelle(Kristen Hicks), a quiet girl with body issue problems, is the first to die in ""Elephant"". The pizza delivery guy intuits correctly that these girls are outcasts. The popular girls know where all the parties are. With artful subtlety, ""Booksmart"" addresses the school shooting epidemic. Pat keeps a shotgun in his glove compartment. When Amy shows Pat the stack of pizza boxes on her phone, his eyes squint in recognition; the parties that he wasn't invited to.The kids in ""Booksmart"" are Veronica Sawyer's crowd. At the end of ""Heathers"", after saving the student body from being blown to smithereens, she notifies Heather Duke that ""there is a new sheriff in town"". She befriends Martha Dunstock. The graduating class in Wilde's film attend the sort of high school that Veronica was reshaping Westerberg into; the high school that J.D., the demolition expert, dreamed about, in heaven. But heaven is a place on earth. ""El Presidente"" and ""The Protest Lady"" are welcomed with open arms. The ""football"" player doesn't spray beer in their faces; he offers to be their Lloyd. Tanner tells them: ""You guys honestly freak me out, but I'm gonna miss you guys.""It's all blood in the Van Sant film.In ""Booksmart"", ""it's all love"".",Booksmart
142,IamROCKAS,Olivia Wilde's directorial debut is a success,9,24 June 2020,"Booksmart can be described as another cliche coming-of-age story, taking place during the last day of school, just before graduation. Just by saying that, most of us can picture what we can expect but Booksmart manages to bring some new light into the genre.Olivia Wilde's directorial debut is a success in my eyes. Even though the dialogue made me cringe or feel uncomfortable during several occasions and several scenes were way exaggerated but it makes up for it with a vast cast of likeable characters. I don't think there's a single character I despised. And, just like with graduation, I kind of feel like I've parted my way with them all at the end of the movie, just to, hopefully, stumble upon them in other works they might appear in in the future.The production and cinematography were better than descent for a comedy movie. Like the skateboarding with a fire extinguisher scene or everything turning into complete silence between the two lead roles, only with faint music and people observing and filming the argument with their phones in the blurred out background, these kind of quality pictures make the movie more memorable in my book.Booksmart is kind of bizarre, even surreal at some moments and that fits the coming-of-age genre like a charm. It may not be perfect, but it certainly is enjoyable to watch on a boring evening to cheer you up.",Booksmart

Most films I've recently read reviews for whether they are iconic (Misery, requiem for a dream) or not too memorable (The dead don't die) have way too many extreme ratings. This film has a 7 something rating yet the 1st 3, 4 pages r mostly 1 star rates with VERY similar critiques (vulgar; it's R!, not funny, female superbad, cliche characters; bet most teens are)
I never got a chance to see this in theaters so when I finally spotted it in Redbox had to get it. Sooo glad I did bc I found this to b great! I totally believed the message was to not judge books by their covers because one twosome was totally unexpected also, didn't expect Amy to be a lesbian. The drug trip doll scene was hilarious as was the pizza delivery car scene. I really thought Billie gave a very humorous performance but my favorite characters might've been the 2 theatre kids; they basically stole every scene they were in.
My volume was a little wonky at the beginning so I was under the impression gigi and jared or Jerry (dude with the boat) and ryan and Nick were pairs of siblings so when I saw ryan and nick kissing I was taken aback til I rewound and realized they weren't related!

153,pamma09,This generation,8,14 June 2019,"I had heard that this was a really funny movie - there are many funny moments.

They realize that they have not had fun in school and it is the day before graduation - so they decide to have fun. And in the course of it all they go to three very different parties and reality of what they have missed from each other and their classmates finally dawns on them. They really did not know their classmates.
I like the fact that Amy and Molly wake up to their friendship and know it is valuable to both of them. The casting of Amy and Molly was perfect. Olivia Wilde first director adventure is good - not perfect but there is hope that she keeps doing it. Teens have a hard time these days and so many of those things were shown.

It's a fun coming of age story with its heart in the right place. It's not an agenda driven movie, when it could've been. I wish they'd made more out of the social divide between the girls and their classmates, only hinted at in the quote I used for the reviews title. I think emphasizing the class and privilege disparity between the girls and their classmates would've given the movie more relevance. The script was whip smart, although not as funny as I would have liked. The direction was not impressive in terms of camera work, but credit must be given to Director Olivia Wilde for getting good performances from her young cast, no small feat.

156,helenbassett,Booksmart Film Review - Olivia Wilde Directs What Happens When It Isn't Too Late To Come Out - And I Laughed Throughout,10,10 June 2019,"Olivia Wilde directs a geeky tale of high school swots Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, who studied hard, and partied less, to get into the right colleges. When they find out that the losers at school are not only joining them at Yale, Molly Gordon's 'Triple A', don't ask, but alternatively going to their first choice of Harvard, playing football on scholarship at Stanford, or joining Google. They got there with hard work and some pretty hard partying too. This is not a dear diary moment. No our Romy and Michele realise that they have to make amends to themselves, and chalk up some serious partying on this last night before graduation. If they only knew where the party was?Beanie and Kaitlyn are Molly and Amy in this sweet coming out story. To be fair Amy is already out, and the girls are literally coming out - to party. In a nice touch Lisa Kudrow, the original Michelle, who plays Amy's mother, along with Will Forte as her father, have planned their daughter's last evening before graduation. But the girls have to bail. It's now or never.And Booksmart isn't like any end of school party I went to, no one was out and proud!, but it crams in the best of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Pretty In Pink and Grease, and it's a tonne of fun.I'm sure I'm not the target audience but I loved what Olivia Wilde has done with her young cast. I would actually say that it was an ensemble piece as the young stars and their classmates were utterly fantastic. I loved all of them, Skyler Gisondo and Billie Lourd at the first party on a yacht. And then unknowingly high on drugs our girls head out to thespians Noah Galvin and Austin Crute's Murder Mystery Party. And a very weird doll size trip. Until they get to The Party. And here is potential for Amy to get with her skater girl crush Victoria Ruesga, and Molly to suddenly have the hots for her Class VP Mason Gooding.And it all goes so well for the girls, until it doesn't. But Diana Silvers, is on hand to guide Amy through her first time. Well that could have gone better. And there may even be some jail time, and a serial killer, just to add serious form to this one night of madness. But Olivia whips it all up with a pizza cutter and with added support from the grown-ups including Jason Sudeikis, Michael Patrick O'Brien and Jessica Williams, we hope they'll all make it through to graduation.I laughed throughout the movie, an ensemble of women writers including Sarah Haskins, Katie Silberman, Susanna Fogel and Emily Halpern, kept the action zipping along, and I would definitely go see what Olivia does next.",Booksmart

158,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Booksmart,9,15 June 2019,"There are a handful of movies that I have always wished I could have seen in the cinema when they first came out. Certain films feel so important and ingrained in the year that they were released that I feel tangible amounts envy towards the people that got to experience them at them at the time they were most relevant. Near the top of this list for me is 2007s Superbad. I was 6 when Superbad was released and so naturally I didn't get to see it until much later, the point of that film would have likely went over my head at that age as well, I wish I could have been leaving high school when that film was out so I could experience it at its most impactful. I can only image how emotional and relatable the story of two best friends trying desperately to make it to the last party before graduation would have been for teenagers who were going through the same types of situations at the time.Well as I said, I was 6 when Superbad was first shown in cinemas. I am about to turn 18 and I honestly feel like I have just walked out of my Superbad. I left high school early but was still invited to my prom which I went to just 6 days before seeing this film, there was a strange feeling that filled the room as if it had only just dawned on a lot of my old classmates that meeting up and hanging out was going to made a lot harder after this summer due to everyone having different plans. Although I didn't stay for my final year at that school I would be lying if I said that this wasn't a feeling that hit me too at a certain point in the night after running into some old friends I hadn't spoken to in a few months.To get more to the point (and actually talk about the movie I'm meant to be reviewing) that is the feeling that I got while watching Booksmart. This film expertly captures the feeling of moving on after high school in a way that most films aimed at teenagers completely fail to do.The characters feel like real teenagers, with real teenage problems. The performances are all fantastic especially from the two leads who are both destined to become stars after this. The tone is far from bleak despite what my intro may have had you think. I compared this to Superbad for a reason, it tackles it themes of separation and moving on in a mature way but it is still absolutely hilarious. The interactions between Dever and Feldstein are continuously funny, aided by what appears to be a heavy focus on imporv. The side characters also offer a lot of comedic potential that is rarely missed. Despite not appear much in the film Jason Sudeikis is at the top of his comedic game whever he is on screen however the best moments tend to come from Billie Lourd as Gigi. Lourd is a complete scene-stealer in all of the best ways as she commits 100% to a character that, if handled poorly, could have become insanely irritating. Honestly considering that I had only seen Lourd as Lieutenant Connix in the recent Star Wars sequels, a pretty forgettable role that she was given because her mother was Princess Leia, I did not expect her to be this great.This is also the feature debut for actress turned director Olivia Wilde which you would not guess from how well this film is put together. I would not be at all surprised if Wilde decides to change course with her career much like Greta Gerwig seems to have opted to do.I don't see this film garnering much awards buzz at the end of the year but, with the risk of spoilers for my 2019 retrospective, this is absolutely my favourite film of the year so far. I only really had an issue with one scene in particular where the score takes over way to much but that is all I will say about that so as to avoid spoilers. I highly recommend checking this out although I do admit that this may have just been the right film at the right time for me personally, but Isn't that the real joy of film?",Booksmart

Although it's unfair to compare it to Superbad since it deals with far deeper questions and topics, the humor does seem to be kind of similar.Admittedly, some of the acting was definitely sub par, but the whole story was anchored well by two strong central performances of young talents to look out for, surrounded with some very good character actors.",Booksmart

167,andrewburgereviews,Superbad?,8,9 September 2019,"Despite the similarity in its premise, this is not gender-swiped ""Superbad"". Olivia Wilde's directorial debut is actually a movie which bifurcates more and more as it goes on. Sure, they are both embedded in the coming-of-age roots, but ""Booksmart"" takes a surprisingly heartwarming turn--one which for once claims that reality is actually better than imagined.The movie follows two students, Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (Beanie Feldstein) on the eve of their high school graduation as the two inseparable BFF's aim to squeeze in years worth of fun into one final cathartic graduation party. The two are instantly lovable. From their first scene together in which Amy picks Molly up from her house. The two start a sudden witty street dance-off and their chemistry is perfect with spot-on interactions and dialogue between them. From here, you can immediately see their inexperienced attempts at rebellion and ""cool"" which makes them silly more than anything else. But this if fine, you only like them more for it.The movie follows the two protagonists and you discover more at the same pace they do. Molly views her classmates as immature, irresponsible brats and looks down on them. She can almost imagine them in menial jobs and unfulfilled destinies due to them lacking her motivational mumbo-jumbo (which includes an audio-book by Michelle Obama to which Molly listens every morning). Wilde manages to convince us of anything the protagonists believe. Their truth becomes our truth. It is an incredible feat coming from a first-time director. Not soon enough, though, Molly has a realization. She finds out that her classmates--the irresponsible ones--also got into great colleges, like her and Amy. This entire discovery is shocking both to her and to the viewer. Is not because is hard to believe that people who have fun are not responsible, but because of the personal and connected view we have to the protagonist.From this point on, ""Booksmart"" goes away from ""Superbad"". It constantly puts the two protagonists in unexpected situations, but is the most heartwarming when it comes to the actual party. There, Molly and Amy are greeted better than expected as if the film says: ""See, is not that bad? All you have to do is try!"" This message is more explicitly said by the two students' favorite teacher, Miss Fine (Jessica Williams) who advises them to live their life otherwise they'll regret it and burn themselves out. It is a message to them, but is also a message to everyone. A warning for the better. At the party, Amy and Molly experience all the emotional landscape of the high school years that they never did. They feel happy, fall in and out of love, experience love (sort-of), heartbreak, anger and forgiveness.In the end, ""Booksmart"" is quite the catharsis. But how can it not be? Amy and Molly are so uptight that they exteriorise to each other in great manner! They over-compliment and tease one another in extraordinary ways! Of course, ""Booksmart"" occasionally delves into over-the-top teenage ridiculousness and there is one particularly uneasy scene in a pizza delivery guy car, but overall it basks in actuality and not to mention great casting.",Booksmart

170,alexqueens,The perfect high school party movie that means well,9,30 October 2019,"I scoffed at this when it first started making the rounds.
Why would I, a 40 year old, wanna watch a high school comedy full of juvenile silliness? Especially after enduring my fair share of high school movies over the years.
Turns out, there's a lot to appreciate and enjoy here. And I even laughed out loud once. Or maybe twice.Although, had I known beforehand that it was directed by Olivia Wilde, I would have watched it a lot sooner.
In either case, much respect to her. This was a dope move.What I took away from this movie:For a high-school flick, absolutely no one is mean to anyone. No body-shaming, no name-calling. Everyone's beautiful in their own way and everyone respects each other and it somehow feels so genuine. Like, why can't the real world be more like this?
This perfectly demonstrates how you can still make a pretty funny and heartfelt high school comedy without including bullies, toxic masculinity, mean girls.I fully predicted Beanie Feldstein (Jonah Hill's sister) to be the funny goofy one, but wow.. did not expect the otherwise serious looking Kaitlyn Dever to be so funny, silly and a naturally happy-go-lucky kinda gal. And their relationship felt so real, I'll be crushed if you tell me they're not the best of friends in the real world.Kudos to Olivia Wilde in casting her husband Sudekis as the school principal and Lyft driver.

That one kid was way too stupid to get a job at Google making triple figures straight out of college and while there are plenty of kids who get into good schools, to think that a large contingent of stoners and slackers are getting into top universities, especially when the movie shows that they aren't wealthy is unbelievable.",Booksmart

174,mc1382,Count me impressed,9,16 June 2019,"Booksmart was a lovely surprise, so much is fantastic about it. The chemistry between the two leads was ""palpable"" and they did some of the best acting I have ever seen. If this isn't the most realistic protrayal of teens I don't know what is. The other characters get moments to shine too and by the end you feel no stone has been left unturned. The film hammers you with joke after joke and while it can be a bit much at times, I was so caught up in the enegry of the film that it didn't bother me that much. The film detours into surreal moments which I felt were a bit hit or miss. The stop motion sequence was a bit jarring for my taste but the Molly dance with Nick scene was the best out of them.Where I feel the film falters is in the third act. The film up to that point presented YA cliches, subverted them and put them into a heightened reality. There's a plot point where the characters have conflict and it felt like the film was changing back to the cliche YA films it pulls from. It didn't present anything new and felt a bit lazy. It went against the spirit of the film for me. The film also gets a bit overindulgent with it's character arcs (One word: Jail). Luckily it picks up later and ends on a high note. Despite that this was a blast. If you haven't seen Booksmart yet go see it. In the YA genre it's one of the best films I've seen.P.S.

It is a completely different story. That being said, this review may be a bit bias, when I watched Booksmart originally I had literally just watched both 21 Jumpstreet films and Superbad, I was expecting a comedy. This is a coming of age Drama Comedy. It does have funny parts, but at its heart, it is a drama.While the film was entertaining, some scenes were sexual and it seemed to have a political overtone. Other than those things, I only have a few artistic choices that I personally did like, but that should not affect one's choice to view the film.

First of all, it is supposed to be a comedy, but it isn't funny at all. I have no idea when you were supposed to laugh. There was nothing new at all, and what there was wasn't done well.
The first hour is just a bunch of people acting like they are all on crack and it is mostly made like tiny montages. And then there is the usual phase where things go a little bad before it is all good again.
84 metascore!? You must be f...king kidding me. I don't even get the user rating. This can only be entertaining if you are 16 and have never seen any movie like this before.",Booksmart

It is mainly the two main characters first time going out after studying hard for five years straight with no partying at all. The sex scene between Kaitlyn Dever and Diana Silvers was so empowering as you never normally see this on Films And TV Shows as often especially it going wrong on an drunken night out at a party and recovering and saying it is OK to make mistakes even in romance and Sex as we are all human, which is so important as taking the mick can be really cruel and bullying.

183,nightwishouge,A tonal mishmash,4,25 May 2021,"I wanted to like Booksmart. I even defended it for a while against my girlfriend, who proclaimed as soon as the credits rolled that she wasn't a fan.I was lying to her. I was lying to myself. I didn't like Booksmart.The biggest problem is that Olivia Wilde, a first-time director, does not have the confidence and steady ability to navigate the extreme tonal shifts. Tones CAN shift in a movie, and rather successfully--Django Unchained, for example, is a masterclass in flexible reality. Booksmart just feels like a number of disparate movies pasted together.The first half is heightened to the point of absurdism. Think of those Adam McKay-Will Ferrell comedies. Nothing is real and there are no stakes to anything; the real world is left behind as implausibilities mount on implausibilities. I wouldn't mind this too much except a) none of the jokes really land and b) the plot has nowhere to go. It's just two girls trying to get to a party and winding up at the wrong place, over and over again. Don't get me wrong: the notion of being frustrated in one's efforts to get somewhere CAN make for a good, worthwhile story, but there still has to be a certain progression. In, say, Planes, Trains, & Automobiles, the two characters have a dynamic relationship that moves forward even as they themselves go nowhere. This section of Booksmart is just a sequence of comedic sketches stitched together with bad improv.When they do finally get to THE party, suddenly we're supposed to be in the real world (or at least the big-budget indie version of it), and the cinematography and soundtrack get all elegiac. I started to get sucked in to this part of the movie, in spite of myself. Characters actually do start to take on depth and dimension here, and our protagonists do start to learn something about themselves, to grow and develop compassion and become better people.Then something contrived happens, because we need to kick off act three (usually signified, in buddy movies or romcoms, by your two main characters having a devastating fight). The movie bounces back into nonsense for a while and ends unmemorably.As a kid who did work way too hard in high school for no real gain in later life, I was primed to relate to these girls. I couldn't relate to them, though, because they are rarely presented as real people. Maybe Wilde thought it would be too sad a movie if they seemed real. But after Bo Burnham's masterful Eighth Grade (also a directorial debut) manages to truthfully capture the junior high experience in all of its melancholy and pain and confusion and still remain optimistic, I just can't help but think Booksmart could have accomplished so much more.If nothing else, though, the movie is worth seeing for Billie Lourd.",Booksmart

But don't get me wrong: those films were entertaining but the adlibbed dikk jokes run their course after one watch. For whatever reason, that formula worked very well for Booksmart.There were a few times during the film that made me laugh hard.. and a genuine cackle is one of the most difficult things a movie can do for it's audience nowadays. Booksmart was packed with LOTS of little edits, stop-motion animation, slow-mo shots that were actually cool, enjoyable characters (I'm not watching ""characters"" being performed but instead I'm watching kids/young adults acting as stupid as I did in highschool).. emotional reactions are conveyed thru unique/stylistic editing & music to keep you engaged throughout the 90-something minutes. It's funny as hell and never takes itself seeiously nor does it hammer in any social justice filler (don't listen to these a-hölez.. they're just uncomfortable with the idea of a lesbian lead role being portrayed as a full-fleshed human being)..Highly recommended, even for the easily offended, because they'll be laughing too.",Booksmart

188,briefexistance,amazing,10,14 November 2020,"This is great in so many ways!!!!!! yes, it's a movie for teenagers BUT it's so smart and fresh it's impossible to not enjoy it. So, main highlights:It has POC and queer representation (non-binary, gay)
It doesn't vilify handsome, popular people as one dimensional beings, rather humanizes them, as much as humanizes our main characters
It shows friendship as a constant struggle for being ourselves with the other person, but what's the limit? in one scene we can see how lack of communication, grudges and selfishness floats under the surface, even though they are best friends, well no relationship is perfect and I'm glad the movie shows it
Shows different parenting styles
Shows how important it is to follow your dreams, even though they're different from your best friends' (or anyone, really)
Shows how every teenager is insecure in its own particular way, but deep down, we're all good human beings. This is a weird stage of life but it does get easier, when you don't bully others, you're faithful towards yourself and try to be as clear in your communications as possible.
Presents the possibility of being a social human being but also a serious person who cares about their future.
Also tells teens how important it is not to be reckless with strangers! (Even though, adults can be so ridiculous sometimes)I just love it, I'm glad Olivia Wilde decided to give us the teen movie we need for the current times.

One thing I kept hearing from viewers was that it was ""realistic"" and I just found that untrue. High school dynamics are very hard for adults actors and directors to replicate on screen. Obviously the chaos that unfolds is not meant to seem normal, and that was not an issue. The interpersonal dynamics just didn't seem natural, and Amy and Molly's relationship wasn't even my favorite to watch. There were definitely funny moments- the bathroom scene for instance, but something overall felt off in the film's rhythm.",Booksmart
191,nehpetstephen,"Enjoyable, but overrated",6,10 June 2019,"BOOKSMART was marketed a bit overzealously as the ""female SUPERBAD of this generation,"" but for my money I'd say 2018's BLOCKERS was (quite surprisingly) the sex-positive, female-centric party romp that fit that bill with much more humor, emotion, and focused plotting . BOOKSMART has plenty of pleasing moments, but it seems like it was written by too many people (four, in fact) who weren't quite on the same page in terms of what story they were trying to tell.Case in point, I'll limit myself to discussing the character Jared, played by Skyler Gisondo. Jared is a character of secondary importance, and he plays a role that's fairly crucial to the climax/resolution. He is presented as having a full character arc, but the only thing I can definitively say about him is that he's the richest boy at school. Other than that, it's unclear what he's meant to represent, and he in no way resembles any actual teenager on this earth (silly caricature or otherwise).He's presented as a huge loser, but it's completely unclear why that would be so. For one thing, Skyler Gisondo is gorgeous (check out his abs on Instagram if you don't believe me), yet he's presented as reviled by his classmates. I can forgive that, since attractive actors are cast as losers all the time in teen media (see Dylan Minnette in 13 REASONS WHY, Logan Lerman in PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, etc.), but when you combine that with the facts that he also appears to be 1) loaded, 2) intelligent, 3) generous, 4) kind, and 5) outgoing... then what exactly is going on? He throws a party on a yacht that absolutely nobody goes to. He makes a polite pass at the main character and is dramatically rebuffed. At one point they make it seem like his problem is that he believes he can buy friendship and coolness when in fact he should simply trust in his authentic personality... as if that is a problem that has ever been seriously faced by any wealthy, attractive, friendly, intelligent teenager at any point in the history of adolescence. You'd think the other kids would at least be taking advantage of his munificence, yeah, instead of avoiding him like a plague? Towards the end, he has a heart-to-heart in which he reveals his true aspiration in life... which is completely random and makes it seem like scenes were accidentally cut out of the film.The whole film is kind of jumbled like that. Scenes don't really cohere. Premises are totally implausible. Picaresque side plots appear, amble about for a few minutes, and then vanish. The stakes don't quite make any sense, and resolutions suddenly arise that are completely absurd. An argument that is apparently the emotional climax of the movie comes from left field and apparently is so inconsequential that the scene simply ends with the swelling of the orchestral score instead of even attending to what the characters are saying.It's pretty funny here and there, but it's also quite forgettable. (Billie Lourd, though... she's hilarious.)",Booksmart

217,TheJohnnyPHreak,"Well Directed, Hilarious, Fun and Classic Teen Comedy",10,25 May 2019,"There is usually a movie once a year (sometimes more than one movie) that really gets me. It's a film that pulls me back into being younger when I was falling in love with films. Last year, it was Sorry To Bother You. This film hit me where I live. It had all the elements of such good filmmaking and storytelling. It was my favorite film of 2018 and I hope more people see it. (It's streaming on HULU right this second) I had high hopes for Olivia Wilde's directorial debut Booksmart. It was a teen comedy right up my ally. I'm a sucker for a one-night movie of antics, debauchery and good characterization. Superbad is one of my favorite movies of all time. I still champion that film to this day. Booksmart was more than I could ever hope for. Let me explain why this and Superbad are brother and sister not just ""Superbad with females"".Kaitlyn Dever (Justified) and Beanie Feldstein (Lady Bird) start as Amy and Molly, two best friends finishing up their high school careers. They have been the two studying, getting the best scores and the highest grades in order to further their futures in a positive direction. One the last day of school, it is revealed that all the kids that were out partying, having fun and being social, some of them got into the same schools. It dawns on Molly that she and Amy have ""wasted"" their high school lives being book smart. They set to rectify this is one night by attended the biggest party of the year. Their one night adventure leads some hilariousness, chaos, self-discovery, and self-realization.Dever and Feldstein are incredible together. Their chemistry pops off the screen. It's so genuine you really would think that these ladies have known each other for years. You can feel every emotion and all they go through in the film. At a certain point in the film, you are 100% on board to ride or ""die"" with these ladies. And it's a great feeling. But the cast surrounding them is excellent as well. Wilde's fiance Jason Sudeikis shows up in a small role as the school principal. Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte show up in a couple of scenes as Amy's loving and very awkward parents. Also, scene-stealer extraordinaire Billie Lourd shows up as very open-minded high schooler. Every scene she shows up in she takes over. I would say her character needs her own film and there's a great way to make that happen. Every main speaking character gets a moment, with some getting more than one. The performances in the film are excellent across the board.This script is so smart. It's very 2019 in all the best way. The dialogue bangs coming out of every actor on screen. It feels natural, know that the audience watching it is smart enough they don't have to spell things out. One thing that hit me in all the right ways is that Amy is lesbian but it's not done as that is her only characteristic. The LGBTQIA community is played for a crutch, it's natural and normal. (Like it should be in life, I'll get off my soapbox now) There are gay supporting characters that are not played as side characters, but support the story, the main characters and not played as a joke. I know this is more an indie film but it's an indie film that is opening in quite a lot of theaters and screens this weekend. I'm happy that Wilde got representation so well.Wilde's direction is what sold me so much on how much I enjoyed this film. She shot the film like a film, not a comedy. Many of these comedies don't shoot their comedies like an actual film, filmmakers stage lighting and shots like a comedy. I would almost call it the Apatow/Rogen effect if you see most of their comedies that have a certain aspect ratio with certain types of shots and lighting. Wilde shot Booksmart like a Scorsese film. There is specific drab light, close up that express emotion and tell the story in a characters looks or reactions. There is a scene near the end of the film that is critical to the characters. I think most directors would have shot this with cuts back and forth, maybe showing some reaction shots. But this scene is shot in one take and she lets the scene evolve and develop. I am very excited to see what she does next because her first effort is a knockout.I see everywhere that Booksmart is being compared to Superbad and rightfully so. The two films have a lot in common. Their films play off similar story beats with similar tropes and ideas. But they differ as well. I would say that the brother and sister relationship would better fit these two films. They make for a great double feature. You could interchange which one you watch first and you'd still feel the impact of both. One that is glaring about the films is that Superbad is a love letter from Goldberg/Rogen where you can tell they were the ""losers"" in school. Booksmart plays mostly everyone as equal. Amy and Molly are shunned as outcast which is very nice to see and gets over the troupe that the ""loser can be cool too"".Booksmart is a film that if it isn't a financial success, that's okay. Because this film is a success everywhere else. I know the movie business is a business but this is one of those films that is so good it should be seen by as many eyes as possible. Olivia Wilde direction along with the performance from Dever and Feldstein and the rest of the cast make this, (in one person's opinion) one of the best teen comedies of all time. I can't praise the film enough for its excellent direction, characters, inclusivity and I forgot to mention the soundtrack. This soundtrack is banging, hip hop infused with little pop and indie sprinkled here and there. If you aren't dancing in your seat, I'd be shocked. Booksmart is one of the best films of the year. It's taken the award (as of now) as my favorite film of 2019.",Booksmart

(9.5/10)Olivia Wilde nails her directorial debut by putting a fun, fresh and female spin on the high school coming of age story with a hilarious script and fantastic performances from the leads.
The high school coming-of-age comedy is a subgenre unto itself, with each decade delivering movies that have become classics, like American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Can't Hardly Wait, Superbad, Easy A and more recent films such as The Edge of Seventeen and Lady Bird. Now comes Olivia Wilde's directorial debut, Booksmart, which follows two straight-laced students who decide to get in all the partying they missed throughout high school on the night before their graduation.
Booksmart is an authentic story about two young women, starring young women, told by women. That authenticity shines especially in the script for Booksmart, which is sharp and funny, nailing the characters of Molly and Amy while effectively developing their friendship as the emotional core of the movie. Booksmart manages to deftly balance the more over-the-top - and, at times, unbelievable - comedic moments with genuinely touching dramatic beats. Altogether, Wilde and the screenwriters Halpern, Haskins, Fogel and Silberman collaborate to bring something new to the high school dramedy genre.
In front of the camera, Feldstein and Dever are easy to love as Molly and Amy, respectively. The success of Booksmart rests on their shoulders and both actresses prove adept at carrying their leading roles well, bringing empathy and humor to their characters. Though Molly comes off as a caricature of a dedicated student at times, Feldstein's performance adds much needed depth to the character, especially in the second half of the film. But throughout the entire movie, Feldstein and Dever have a charming chemistry as friends that shines in Booksmart.
In a genre as crowded as the high school coming-of-age comedy, it's tough for new movies to stand out and offer a fresh perspective on this particular time in a young person's life, but Booksmart does just that. Booksmart is worth a watch for anyone interested in coming-of-age high school comedies. Even viewers who are far removed from their own high school days will find something to relate to in the hijinks of Molly, Amy and their classmates (or, at the very least, in the adults who populate their world).",Booksmart

229,dwremy,Superbad 2019...and it's good.,8,21 September 2019,"Booksmart is a HS movie built for this era and one can't help think of Superbad. Of course they switch things up: 2 girl best friends are the leads(coincidentally Jonah Hill's sister Beanie Feldstein is one of them), and there is a 2019 HS atmosphere to the film. Gay and straight students hang together in a normal manner with barely any acknowledgement to their sexual orientation. And after that all sorts of shenanigans ensue with everyone.
Like Superbad there is the examination of the relationship between the best friends and how their lives will be taking a turn. I won't get into all of the story but I'll say the movie is entertaining. Is it better than Superbad? It's just different in a good way. See it for yourself.",Booksmart

Writing was above average nothing extraordinary some parts were really funny but mostly it wasnt. I didnt really buy the premise. There was no real goal for the lead characters so you kinda dont know for what and why you should root for. This movie will do good in streaming but not in theatres.",Booksmart
232,tomfeller,Two high school girls have some fun,9,7 August 2019,"My parents always told me that while I was ""booksmart"", I was not really good at dealing with people. Although I studied hard in high school, I also took time to have fun, unlike the two main characters of this movie. Molly (Beanie Feldstein) is her class's valedictorian and president (I found the latter implausible considering her lack of social skills), and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) is her best friend. Both were so studious that their only social life was hanging out with each other. Molly has been accepted by Yale with plans of becoming a lawyer, and Amy by Columbia with plans to spend the summer in Botswana. During the last day of school, not having any interest in their other classmates, they only now find out that some of them have been accepted into prestigious schools such as Yale and Stanford, and another has accepted a job directly out of high school writing program code for Google. Molly is especially appalled to find that the girl with the worst reputation in her class for sexual activity (Molly Gordon) was accepted by Yale. They decide to spend their last night in high school partying and eventually attend three of them. This film is very funny, although vulgar, and a smashing debut for director Olivia Wilde. The two girls not only get to have some fun, but they also learn that the people they looked down upon during high school are really worth knowing. The young supporting actors such as Diana Silvers (an unfriendly girl), Billie Lourd (the weird girl who somehow gets to all the parties before the two main characters), Skyler Gisondo (a rich kid), and Victoria Ruesga (a skateboarder) are all excellent, and they are ably supported by veterans such as Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte (Amy's parents), Jason Sudeikis (the school principal), and Jessica Williams (one of their teachers).",Booksmart

It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and one of the most hyped, did it live up to the massive hype? I would say it absolutely did. I thought it was a great coming-of-age film consisting of amazing performances from the two main girls (one of them is actually Jonah Hill's sister IRL) and the characters were very well-developed, and surprisingly not one-dimensional. This was a very good directorial debut for Olivia Wilde and succeeded in making a fantastic movie, while also putting a new spin on the high school comedy genre. I loved the chemistry between Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, the two were great together. And Billie Lourd was also very funny.

I really don't get those bad reviews from the audience when a movie like this can not only convey emotional moments but also when it can teach you things about life. It really brought me to think about my life, like, really. Of course, the plot seems like a bit of ""not really realistic"" but the emotional goals are reached so it doesn't really matter. Since Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name, this is the most experimental picture about youth I've seen.

There are people out there who sincerely think ""Jack and Jill"", Adam Sandler's brutally un-funny 3.3 rated 2011 comedy, is good.With High School party movies, which movie you prefer probably depends on what years you were in high school. I graduated in '98 and still look back fondly at ""Can't Hardly Wait"". A decade later gave us ""SuperBad"". A decade earlier and you're looking at films like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or two decades earlier ""Animal House"". Yes, those were college-based, but let's be honest, that was a different time and there's no way they would've been allowed to show high-schoolers do those types of things!So I sat down excited to watch this generation's high school grad party comedy. I chuckled at a few moments early on but quickly made the realization that no one else was laughing. My theater was silent. And I'll admit, very few parts made me actually laugh out loud. At times, I felt like an outsider getting a glimpse into the secret code of modern teenager humor.So I found myself a little let down by the humor, but not enough so that I didn't enjoy the movie.

The character development for both the major and minor characters was clever and cunning. The soundtrack gave this film color and kept it moving, but the characters gave it life.

249,hnapel,Colorful movie that attempts to trash some cliche's and succeeds by proving that can be refreshingly entertaining,8,2 June 2019,"At face value this is just a high-school movie in that peculiar ooh-la-la genre where students are supposed to have their first sexual experience with lots of those all too familiar cringing situations of shame by proxy. But while it is still a familiar stew the ingredients are a bit different with an attempt to break some cliche's that would otherwise render the attempt to churn out another reel of sameness quite pointless. The main deviation from the norm is the spice provided by the fact one of the main characters is gay and her attempt to land at an experience involving two vagina's is quite entertaining, if not for the unexpected appearance of a stunner named Hope and that she is, gay or not, you'll love her. Aside from the girl-on-girl passion the humor is quite funny throughout and it's not just the one-liners but also the absurdity of the whole plot that can put a smile on your face even when you overthink it later. The story goes that two 'booksmart' girls realize just on the night before their graduation that they missed out on all the extracurricular fun their peers indulged without it affecting their chances on a good follow up college, so why not have both if even for one night and they set out on a rampage to find the hottest party in town and on their journey to do so learn more about each other, their fellow students and the love interests they set out to conquer.

Katie Silberman are geniuses, and these actors were perfect...all the different teenage characters were great (so much more real and complex than in other ""teen movies"" in which kids are caricatures with one-sided personalities...the bully, the deb, etc), but especially Kaitlyn Dever (who had a memorable role in Bad Teacher) and Beanie Feldstein...wow, gorgeous, fearless actors.Naturally (because this film depicts real teenage life, with all its challenges--yes, including raging hormones) the fundamentalist internet trolls have ganged up to give it 1-star ratings. I am against giving the films that I like 10 stars merely to try and even out things (you can see my past reviews, I give between 6 and 8 stars to most of the movies I like)...but this film truly and independently of anything else deserves a 10-star rating, so that's what I'm giving it.Wonderful, just wonderful.",Booksmart

Ms Wilde has promise, but sometimes close-ups can ruin a scene, not enhance it (in my opinion). So a little more wide shots and less close-ups. Also, in what Los Angeles high school do they have co-ed bathrooms? I must have missed that when I attended high school in Los Angeles. I did like the trick with the girl popping up in scenes when you least expected it. That was very funny and timed just right. And the use of the Ms. Wilde's husband, Jason Sudeikis, as the Principle of their school and a part time Uber driver was very good. But, in my opinion, the story was not original and the execution not great. And in fact, not very funny. A few funny scenes, but nothing hilarious.

The films seems stuck between two central themes - is it a comedy, or is it a drama about the life and challenges of being a teen.On the first count, it succeeds reasonably well. There are genuinely funny moments, even if they aren't sustained throughout the film, but overall it's a enjoyable ride. As far a getting under the surface of the stresses of the teenage years, it is a very shallow dive, barely scratching the surface despite some pretentions to go further.The movie is sustained by a real star turn by Kaitlyn Dever, while Beanie Feldstein is OK as the other of the pair of teenage girls.

It's not just along the same lines either the main events in the film (tent poles) almost mirror each other....thats why I don't like it.... Its lazy. Don't get me wrong if you are going to rip off a film there are a lot worse films.... But come on....at least try and make it look a little original. I don't think it's a really bad film, it's OK, I just think of all the time, money and talent that is effectively wasted, they could have made a really good film here but completely missed the opportunity.",Booksmart

Maybe it was not that engaging and predictable but also you get driven by the emotions of the characters they're going through. That's where you're indecisive whether you like this movie or not. I thought I will watch this movie maybe in two bits but I watched it in one go so maybe it has something that keeps you going with it.Characters are too, like, realistic can say or let's say we have these kind of people around us so yeah you might find it relatable. I won't talk about performances here because it was as if they're living their own lives in the movie and you could do it too if you would've been there, but whatever, an appreciation!",Booksmart
266,jacobconnelly-47681,One of the Best Teen Comedies in Ages,9,1 August 2019,"Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein light up the screen with their winning chemistry in Booksmart - the newest film from Olivia Wilde (who shows a flair for wacky comedy and moving friendship drama)Amy and Molly are two overachieving high schoolers who never once stepped out of line or took their eyes off the prize (of getting into a great college.) When they realize that most of their seemingly party-obsessed classmates have also managed to get into top schools, they realize that maybe they need to have one wild, crazy night before graduation to get it out of their systems. Of course, nothing goes according to plan and the two friends find themselves all over town experimenting with drugs, sex, and several wacky characters.In some ways, Booksmart feels like a teenage After Hours with our two leads exploring the L.A. nightlife and getting themselves into several wacky and bizarre scenarios. The entire supporting cast is strong, but Billie Lourde steals the show as a rich, spoiled and completely inane classmate who keeps popping up at random times.",Booksmart

The fat one even kinda looks like Seths character from Superbad, and just found out it's actually Jonah Hill's real life sister, how much more evidence do you need?? The only difference between these two films, is Superbad was totally original, and absolutely hilarious, and didn't require a token black, gay, trans to pander to this generation.

But the best thing for me was the upbeat energy of the whole movie, which credit has to go Olivia Wilde's direction.

281,fpcholcomb,Superokay,6,13 June 2019,"As a drama Booksmart does alright, but as an outright comedy the movie is hit or miss. The colorful cast of characters are well acted but miscast as they look and act nothing like actual teenagers. They are also apparently geniuses attending one of the finest institutions in the country judging by the colleges they will be attending.The friendship between the two main characters was well done but their banter often felt contrived. Moreover, outside of a few jokes involving a stuffed bear I just did not find their interaction as funny as it could have been. The writing for the secondary characters was even worse. Each of the side characters is set up as a kind of high school archetype, the jock, the promiscuous girl, the rich kids, the artsy girl, the partygoers. Then these stereotypes are shirked off to try and teach the audience to not judge books by their covers, commendable but ultimately forced and phony. These characters also often go on diatribes with nothing interesting to say leaning heavily on stereotypes for humor.Some scenes hit the mark, like when the kids are dancing in the street or have a creepy interaction with a pizza guy, but many more miss comedically. As for the direction, the movie has an interesting use of color but some scenes lingered too long and often felt padded and forced. The fact that it was a freshman effort was quite obvious.There is something to like in Booksmart, it has a good message, some heart, and a few laughs, but pound for pound it is absolutely dwarfed by its contemporaries in the genre of teenage coming of age comedies and will likely fall into the depths of obscurity.",Booksmart

286,dswhitcomb,In what school is everyone this confident?,6,27 November 2019,"I just watched Booksmart on Hulu. I was excited to see it listed there as this movie has been on my watch list for this year. I'm giving it 6 stars because it tries hard but falls flat in a lot of areas. I'm older but I don't think that teenagers talk the way the kids do here. They always have an answer and that answer is always politically correct. The plot touches upon bullying but never goes anywhere with it. There is one rich kid and no one wants to be friends with him? Uh, yeah. At that age kids can be bought especially if he has a car and buys iPads for his party goers. The supposedly ""hot"" kid dates the ambiguous girl with glasses and an overbite? Riiiiight. The teenagers are all fine with the gay students and don't make it hard for them to talk about it? My daughter is bisexual and she still has trouble feeling comfortable with that around her peers. Where are the parents at the graduation? No introduction for the valedictorian? A 45 second speech from her isn't realistic at all. There are a few clever ideas in the movie but they don't carry the whole movie. Everything is just too easy for the two leads when trying to get out of predicaments. The ending is silly as well as if the parents wouldn't be taking their daughter to the airport as she leaves for a year long trip to Africa. I understand what Olivia Wilde was trying to say with this movie but it just misses the mark. I gave extra stars for camera work and some originality with scenes but again, it just wasn't enough to make the film one to remember. Another thing I found completely implausible was the teacher having party-ready outfits in her car ( and they fit both of the girls who are way shorter than Jessica Williams and very different body types). I'll put this movie in my file as eh, one to watch if there is nothing else on and you are snowed in for a few days.",Booksmart
287,gigitville,Made Me Nostalgic for High School and I Hated High School,9,30 May 2019,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be anything all that special, since decent modern comedies are few and far between. But this was actually a really funny, accurate depiction of high school that had heart and style to top it off. Not to mention it avoided a lot of the cliché tropes from other high school based comedies. This was Olivia Wilde's directorial debut and she did a great job. There was some great cinematography, the casting was great, and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it. Plus, there was some social commentary and progressive messages that were handled in a respectful way, which I hope results in people actually listening to said messages.The performances by Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein were great and they had a very convincing friendship. That was the kind of thing that could make or break the film, since it revolves around their friendship, but it definitely made it.If I had a critique, I'd say the pacing sagged a bit in the middle. One of the reasons this stands out though is because the pacing in the rest of the movie is so spot on.I definitely recommend this film since it's the first modern comedy that's actually made me laugh and was smart, heartfelt, and felt like the person making it was actually passionate about what they were making. 9/10.",Booksmart

290,captain_dimpf,Scriptdumb rather,3,8 July 2020,"The acting, the camerawork, the directing, the editing, it's all average, it's not particularly bad, so normally I would give it a five out of ten. Well the script is bit of a downer, but it would still be a four. What makes this movie so unbearable to watch, is it's pointlessness, it's redundancy and ultimately the bad name it gives female driven comedy. See it's sets out to be a female version of your typically Highschool Nerd flick like Superbad, and it is desperate to prove that nerdy girls can be as funny as nerdy boys, when in fact it proves exactly the opposite and that is devastating for the gender equality movement. But I finally get the South Park jokes where Cartman claims that girls can't be funny and when the try nonetheless, the say vagina a lot. But we all know that girls can be funny. Emma Stone, is the first that springs to mind, but the moment a movie relies on one of the protagonists to be fat, in order to be funny, you know they're in deep trouble. Casting a fat girl just doesn't make her a female Jonah Hill. It's not that simple.I felt boredom throughout this cringeworthy movie, and writing about it a day later is surprisingly hard cause I forgot about it almost as soon as the end credits rolled in. Mental self-defence, I guess. But this much I remember: In it's total predictability, it strings together one stereotype and cliché to the the next, be it characters or key scenes, all of which you have seen a million times before and far better at that. The acting is permanently way over the top, leaning towards a slapstick humour that is generally associated with cheap teen flicks from the seventies. At first I had hoped it was done ironically, but that turned out to be wishful thinking.
So yeah, pointless at best but ultimately really a severe setback, when you as a feminist like me, try to advocate for more female directors and script writers.",Booksmart

I suspect this is simply by the same virtue that every month the top movie in theatres creeps in to the 'Greatest films of all time' rankings on IMDB. I knew it probably wouldn't be the best of the decade, but still figured it would at least be 'good'. It had been awhile since a new comedy came along that worked for me, and I was in the mood for light viewing so decided to give it a chance. I went in to it blind without any trailer beforehand... but I literally could not make it 5 minutes in, the cringe was so unbearable. It reminded me of a bizarro version of 2001's ""Ghost World"", except with intolerable characters and jokes so bad that I felt embarrassment transfer... it was like watching an amateur stand-up comedian bomb on stage.

So they have one last night before graduation, and plan to party for the last time they could. This movie is very self-aware and knows to not take itself too seriously. It's purely lighthearted and fun throughout. Throughout the movie you learn a lot more about the characters in the movie, and many of these things are very relatable, having been things that are commonly dealt with or things that everyone has experienced at least once. Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein do an outstanding job with their performances in this movie as the 2 main characters. However, sometimes the movie takes things too far and drags a little bit just for a joke, it can also feel repetitive at times, which if you've seen the movie then you'd know which scenes I'm talking about. It can feel a little bit rushed with the way characters get brief introductions but play a big role in the movie later on though you don't know much about them. However, this movie is overall great and teaches life lessons in a different way. The jokes are funny for the most part and many of the comedic scenes are played out well.

312,christianolivarez-78828,I LOVE Amy.,7,20 June 2019,"Hello. How are you? Great. We're talking about Olivia Wild's director debut Booksmart. No spoilers here because I really think you should see it. So, Booksmart is a movie about Amy (played by Kaitlyn Denver) and Molly (played by Beanie Feldstein) who spent their whole high school careers studying diligently and not going to any parties with the goal of attending an Ivy League school. It's the last day of school when they find out that the students who partied also got into these schools. So they decide that they are going to go to the best party that same night to redeem themselves and get some experience prior to graduation. All caught up? Cool.So the movie does a really good job on establishing Amy's and Molly's friendship. It's kind of odd because there's not much about their past, but the chemistry from the two characters really shows through and brings you to the understanding that they have been through a lot and have a great friendship. The performance throughout the entire movie is actually really great if you ask me. Molly is more of the aggressor whereas Amy kind of plays the part of doing whatever since Molly is her best friend. The dialogue is pretty in your face but not so much in a way that feels forced. Now that doesn't mean that this movie is absolutely realistic but that's okay. Their role in school is shown right away as kind of the geeks that no one hangs out with because they are so into their studies. The way Molly finds out about the others getting into the same schools is well done and seems like something that would happen. So here's where Molly convinces Amy that they are gonna go out that very night.I really liked this movie because of the urgency aspect since the majority of the movie is all in the same night so it feels like you're there. I would compare this feeling to Superbad as the set up is relatively similar. I also really liked how much music they used throughout this movie to set the scene and keep things flowing. Well done. So the events that occur are pretty out there but the writing of the movie and the way they use all their characters to their full potential helps with the movie not getting dull. You know. How many times can you hear ""we need to find this party"" before you find yourself saying ""can you get to the party already"". They do this a couple different ways. There's some love interests and they play on it really well i thought.The movie does have a good build and the character arcs are very good too. However, with all the events that are happening through the movie, I wouldn't really say there's a climax. There's a scene where there's an argument and that might be the climax, but honestly there's so much that happens afterwards that it makes the movie somewhat of a roller coaster. The good thing is that by the end of the movie you can really connect with both of the characters. I found myself wanting the best for them and was invested in the outcome of the night for these two.The last quarter of the movie is pretty great and i found myself happy with the way things turned out. It's all in the open for everyone and things are pretty clear. The part that I didn't love all too much was the closure for each of the characters. Yeah, things came out great but it does kind of go from devastating to happy real quick. I would have liked a little more insight to where these things kind of shifted. The same goes for the very end. Everyone gets what they wanted from the night before, but the vision of what might happen next was kind of a loose end so there's that. One other criticism i would have is how much the movie felt improvised. Don't get me wrong, a lot of it was great but at times the dialogue kind of tried to pull out a laugh when the laugh wasn't there. That's the thing with comedy though. It's subjective and it may have really worked for others.

Instantly, I regret it. 10 minutes into the movie, and i could tell that the trailer was a misrepresentation of the movie. The movie seemed fast-pace, exciting, hilarious. The actual movie was slow, boring, and not at all funny. I probably smiled once. The plot which seemed fresh, also kind of felt like a one-trick pony. I was expecting complexities, more to the plot than meets to the eye, enganging subplots. But we get none of this. To top it all off, the ""super original premise"" I thought is a rip from a movie called SuperBad. Not watching comedies very often, I hadn't watched it, but decided to watch it after watching this one. Although not a favorite, I'd rate that movie a 6 star. It was quietly funny, competent and I'm sure had I seen it 12 years back, the humor would have felt fresh. I could see how much more this idea shined in the hands of the original writer. I really wanted to like the story. I love movies with female cast, I think these actresses are so talented, but the story wasn't there. Super disappointed!",Booksmart

Olivia Wilde & Co. have taken the sub-genre and turned it on its head, and done so brilliantly, breaking 20th century rules of film, and engineering twists and turns that simply worked. I was totally on board for the emotional ride with the different characters from start to finish.

This is as bad as it gets. I suppose I'm much too old to find any of this funny or enjoyable.
Every cliché from the past 5 years is thoroughly represented in this movie.
Dialogue sounds fake, and is not as witty or funny than in other comparable films, characters are cheaply written, skin deep and annoying...just derivative from start to finish.
You know those cliché obnoxious sarcastic teen characters we've been getting by the truckload ever since ""darla"" was a thing?
This film pretty much amounts to nothing else than this : an hour and 40mns of self intitled whining and witless dialogue.
You think ironic slo mo montages with gangsta rap playing in the background is getting old and obnoxious? Wait till you see this film. Or don't.
As said before, take Superbad, remove the sincerity, the humour and the originality and you end up with this.
Back to the drawing board Wilde : next time try to come up with things of your own instead of rehashing stuff that was already made 10 times better by other more talented -and sincere- people.",Booksmart

Unfortunately there was too little comedy that made me laugh. Basically there were two good, funny scenes surrounded by nonsense.The plot is your usual smart but lacking social life characters decide to let loose storyline. I read reviews saying it was really realistic. Maybe I've been out of high school too long, but very little about this school seemed real. Kids skateboarding in the hall, throwing water balloons, and a rich kid throwing graduation party on a mega yacht isn't what I remember high school like. But besides that point, the main problem I had was the movie just lacked anything funny.I also had a hard time liking the main characters. They were mostly one dimensional stereotypes (ie rich kid is really rich, theatre kid is really into theatre, etc). There was hardly any background and little that made me like anyone in the film. It seemed the writers tried to overcome a lack of good jokes and/or humorous situations by just making the main characters cuss and talk about sex. This has been done before, so it isn't new and honestly felt way too forced and lazy in this film. At times the vulgarity didn't even seem to fit the characters, which made me like them even less. Your opinion may differ, but I wasn't a fan of the movie.",Booksmart

I don't really care about that. But, just don't understand how they couldn't have made this more original and more geared toward girls/women instead of trying to make girls/women like boys/men. Women and high school girls can be so much more interesting. And I am not so sure about the acting of Beanie (sp?) she is okay, but I think the director may not have given the girls enough to do to be more of standouts.

I mean, that must have been the pitch for this one right? This is the type of movie that I should love and yet, I couldn't help, but feel that there wasn't a single original thing in this whole film. What made Lady Bird and Eight Grade so charming was their hyperrealism. It felt like a true, genuine portrayal of teenage life in contemporary America. This film wanders into unrealistic farce, but then wants to turn itself into an intense indie drama halfway through.

There is a kernel of a story here that at least has the potential to be interesting: the two smart girls who are graduating from high school and haven't ever had any fun, till they go over the top the night before graduation. But if they're so smart, why are they so stupid? Why don't they have any real wit? If the audience can tell in advance exactly what's coming next, why are the ""smart girls"" so oblivious? How difficult would it have been to make this movie actually funny or clever? Looks like they didn't try very hard. A cascade of F-bombs and v-words isn't all that hilarious, especially when that's all there is. Oh, yeah, they get wet in the pool, too. Ha ha.

The story felt too superficial with the viewer not even properly getting to know the characters (and at times in a forceful way) and things starts happening all in a single day and night..

And then...nothing. Yeah, there was sort of a weak bit of maturation tacked on there at the end, but you'll miss it if you blink or more likely, have fallen asleep by that point of this incredibly tedious and predictable high school comedy. The characters are universally odious characters with the possible exception of the one or two that were supposed to be odious but in fact provided the only vaguely entertaining moments of the story.Worst thing about this movie? It plays it safe. It could have mercilessly ripped on these fine young twits, but it never takes even a mild swing. The ""helping Africans make their own tampons"" line, for example, actually turns out to be serious; if the script can't swat a hanging curve like that one, there is no hope whatsoever.If Fast Times at Ridgemont High is bit too real for you, try something like Orange County or Easy A, two films that operate in the same milieu as Booksmart, but have the advantage of being rip roaringly funny and wicked smart, too, factors completely absent in this less than mediocre comedy.

333,pwbeatty,The 'Mean Girls' of the Next Generation,8,15 August 2020,"'Booksmart' is directed by Olivia Wilde and stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein as Amy and Molly, two soon to be high school graduates that spent their entire school years focusing on academics, and forgoing the 'traditional' high school experience of partying and getting into trouble. The week before graduation they discover that all their fellow students were able to have BOTH, getting into great schools and being able to party. Now Amy and Molly decide they need to have the high school experience they missed out on all in one night, hilarity ensues, etc. While yes, this is a very similar plot to the Greg Mattola classic 'Superbad' but where 'Booksmart' stands apart is in it's lead performances and smart a clever directing by Olivia Wilde.In the first act it's very clear they are following the same story beats as 'Superbad' and many other coming of age films where the objective of the main characters is to ""get laid"". I don't want to harp to much on that because really, there aren't many films that can execute a story THIS well, so even if there are parallels, they do enough with the story to make it not feel like it's trying to imitate something else.The performances by both Dever and Feldstein come very naturally to them, you believe that these two have been friends for a really long time, and the chemistry and back and forth between them are as strong to me as a Tina Fey/Amy Poehler dynamic duo. I think their characters were explored really well, I particularly loved Devers performance as the ""trying to get laid"" character. It's a change of pace to not only see a lead female character be comfortable with her own sexual preferences, but to also know what they want and are willing to act on it is really empowering and I just really appreciated seeing that on screen.There are also a few standout performances from the side characters. Jessica Williams as the 'cool' teacher 'Miss Fine' and Skyler Gisondo as the dweeby kid that shows the real side of him later on in the story. I loved their performances and thought they brought alot of the humor to the story. The MVP performance that I did not expect was from Billy Lourd, daughter of the late Carrie Fisher. I think she was absolutely hilarious in this role, she was able to just go crazy with it and I wanna see more of her in future comedic roles.The movie is shot pretty well, utilizing some fun camera tricks and trying to give each shot a more visually pleasing look, rather than how many comedies end up looking because there isn't enough focus on the technical aspects but with this, Wilde was able to do both very well.I had such a good time seeing 'Booksmart'. It's got heart, laughs and a great pair of leading actors. While it borrows from many of the coming of age films before it, 'Booksmart' stands apart as a very well shot, funny and entertaining film that could stand the test of time as being this generations 'Mean Girls'.",Booksmart

Amy and Molly realise that throughout all of high school, all they ever did was study. They thought that that would get them in better schools, which it did. But the people who were out partying got into good schools too. So they have been missing out on many parties throughout the years, just to end up at the same schools as those who did party. Molly decided that they, on their last night before graduation should go out and party hard, to which Amy reluctantly agrees.That's the plot of booksmart. With this plot you could make the most cliched, boring, safe teenage comedy ever. And even though this movie has it's cliches, it also has some new things. It explores every character very well. Very few character in this movie are one sided stereotypes, with the only exception being some theater boys. But everyone else get to have more than just one side. Not every character is explored equally, but they all get to show different sides of themselves and break stereotypes. That is a very nice thing to see in teenage movies, because often there will be a little too many stereotypes.Now this is a comedy. The most important thing for a comedy is to be funny. So is this movie funny? I certainly think so. Now comedy is obviously subjective, but i found this movie very funny. To me, most of the jokes landed. They were used perfectly and not drawn out too much. Much of the humor also stems from some relatability. A person that could be very hit or miss in this movie would probably be Gigi (played brilliantly by Billie Lourd) who is a rich and very over the top girl. Even though she is not that realistic and kinda over the top, I still found her very funny and the character didn't take anything away from this movie.That does bring me to another thing. Is this movie realistic. Not really. Some characters, like Gigi and the situations created by her are often unrealistic. Many other situations the characters end up in are not that realistic either. But these situations are there to either be funny or make a point and they all do that very well, so I don't mind the fact that they aren't realistic, because it works good in the movie. Some situations could however, be very realistic and relatable. Many of the dilemmas and themes explored in the movie, are definitely relate to many teenagers. Since this movie uses it's unrealistic situations so well, I don't mind them.Olivia Wilde directed this movie and for a debut movie, It's pretty darn good. It looks good, the acting is good and taking on a comedy as a first movie is brave, but Olivia WIlde pulled it off. This is not only a hilarious movie it also explores many themes and dilemmas relatable to the viewers. Overall a well executed movie with few flaws.8/10",Booksmart

The settings of stories such as Dazed and Confused, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Empire Records, are so swaddled in a blanket of reminiscence and rose tinted memory that it is easy to miss an authentic showing of current young culture as is offered up to us in Booksmart.An episodic movie, we follow Amy and Molly on their hi-jinx filled night of calamities and accidental parties as they attempt to make up for a lack of partying in their high schooling lives. The drive of the film are the characters fantastically made flesh by Dever and Feldstein, the charm of the film certainly lives in the tangible, almost magical, connection of friendship between the two.A well paced story this odyssey-by-night plot line is well maintained by strong, on point and in the zeitgeist humour that can cut generational divides, even as it stretches to the bounds to an oddness that may alienate some.

I mean it's not a bad movie, acting is not bad, it's done well but it's just too much Superbad coloured with a bit of 2019 politics and ideology. The characters resemble those in the mentioned movie, the story too, even the setting of the movie... Nothing special.",Booksmart
364,lewisblackhall-17157,Modern day Superbad,7,7 May 2019,"Went to a preview screening last night and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie, it really made me laugh at times and thats all you can ask for from a comedy. Both of the main characters are great in their roles and you end up caring about what happens to them along the way. There are definitely some elements from Superbad used here but with more of a current day vibe to them. I would recommend this movie to a friend.",Booksmart
365,jcaamaya,Hilarious,8,5 June 2019,The acting was solid. Casting was on point except for the character who played Ryan (super annoying).The girls have instant chemistry.I laughed out loud countless times.Super impressed by Olivia Wilde's directing.(I think people will be turned off because one of the main characters is a lesbian. Who cares? As if a lesbian protagonist isn't plausible. No one is telling you to agree with their life style. Just watch the movie and enjoy.),Booksmart

367,ebrahimeysam,Bravo Olivia Wilde...,9,13 September 2019,This movie was very good in story. It had some defects but most of story and scenes were extremely beautiful and familiar. Love it. Try to watch it in high stoned condition :) One of important scenes was in WC when other students showed their success opposite of Molly's thoughts. This made me to watch it completely. Also the end of movie cant be guessable.,Booksmart
368,p1nn,Hilarious yet solemn,7,27 June 2019,"I think the funny scenes are well contrasted by the sadness in the entire story. Two girls who spend their high school life working hard yet not getting the reward they deserve, fully encapsulating the concept of work smart not work hard. The story is also about growing up and though the movie didn't cover this, but as someone who has gone through high school, I fully understand how this seemingly tight relationship between the best friends will inevitably come to past as time passes and college approaches. The story is as much about cherishing the relationship we have in that moment since everyone will ultimately grow apart with time, distance and life. Making all the hilarious and fun moments the two best friends have experienced together the more valuable and sad.",Booksmart

Laughed a lot, even had tears in my eyes, was not bored for a second, will watch it again.It is beautifully shot in many scenes (no spoiler: that one shot during the escalating conflict) and breaks with a lot of clichees without reminding you every 2 minutes that it breaks with clichees. And if you do not like it because it talks about periods and normalizes please grow up. I have to think really hard to even find a movie that deals with these topics remotely as naturally as Booksmart.You cannot complain about Hollywoods uncreative filmaking (reboots, franchises, etc.) and then hate on a movie like this. Sorry this is what we ask for and Olivia Wild and her team delivered.",Booksmart

371,nkgenovese-1,The kind of movie they don't make anymore,9,28 May 2019,"This was something I had given hope for a long time ago: The smart, well-acted theatrical comedy that doesn't seem to get made anymore in the era of Netflix. This film doesn't reinvent the wheel: The plot (Two girls attempt to attend the last big party before high-school graduation but are constantly thwarted by a series of comic set-pieces) borrows from other similar movies, especially ""Superbad.""Though the film doesn't tread any new ground plot wise, it makes up for that in genuine great comic scenes and great acting from the two leads. The main characters are both broad comic archetypes and, at the same time, relatable. It reminds me of high school as it really was, a place where students tested boundaries and yet were often just trying to figure out their lives. Every character in this movie seemed like someone who may have actually gone to school with me and that leant it an emotional honesty that I think even ""Superbad"" lacked.",Booksmart
372,scoobyjack8,Clueless for my generation.,10,7 May 2019,"Since I started watching movies through an adult lens, I've been waiting for the film that would capture the modern high school experience in the hilarious and heightened way that Clueless did for 1995. This is it! The movie is a laugh riot, the writing is sharp and the characters have so much heart. I feel bad for underestimating Olivia Wilde, she has been in a lot of bad movies but she is clearly a smart woman with a good understanding of how to direct an actor correctly. Speaking of performances, all of the actors here are spot-on. Billie Lourd and Beanie Feldstein are the obvious standouts but Jessica Williams, Kaitlyn Dever and Skyler Gisondo match them every step of the way. Overall, everyone should see this movie - it's destined to be considered a classic of our time in years to come.",Booksmart

374,Lord-Bigglesworth,More drama than comedy,7,24 May 2019,"This is a pretty solid film, and I can see it becoming something of a cult-classic the likes of The Breakfast Club (a film that strongly strikes a chord with some people, but not so much for others), but frankly I was a bit let-down. I thought the trailer was absolutely hysterical, but, sadly, most of the funniest bits are in that very trailer. Maybe the jokes hit harder with a different demographic, and, to be fair, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but it just felt like there was also a lot of dead air. Almost like something that had just happened was supposed to get a big laugh and didn't. Fortunately, the pacing of the film is quick enough to not let any potential misfire moments like these linger. And there are a veritable smorgasbord of entertaining characters (Gigi is MY queen!!) and set pieces to keep things moving at a pleasant, enjoyable speed.While the movie may not be firing on all cylinders in the comedy department, it excels on the drama side of things. Part of the reason why it reminds me of The Breakfast Club is that it feels that the film's real strength lies in what it has to say about US, society, and the generation to which the film is aimed. You'll come away from Booksmart wanting to be a better person... or at least we hope you will.",Booksmart
375,adam-m-fontenot,A messy but fun coming-of-age story,6,27 May 2019,"To make one thing clear right away, Beanie Feldstein (Lady Bird) is a great actress, and definitely the best part of the movie. Kaitlyn Dever is great in it as well. Most importantly, the majority of the comedy worked for me. There are some great quippy lines, and some fun comedy set-pieces. There's a clever drug-induced visual sequence as well (vaguely reminiscent of Climax). Despite the issues I had with the movie as a whole, I consistently found myself laughing along.Unfortunately, the script is full of problems. Tonally the movie is a bit of a mess: we swing back and forth between drama and comedy much too quickly. Most of the time the film strikes an appropriately goofy tone, but the moments when it tries to be serious happen at random and generally feel unearned. When problems arise for characters or they argue, the script doesn't establish these conflicts beforehand. There's an extremely predictable dramatic twist (you'll know it when you see it) that's bad enough to elicit an actual groan from me.The first twenty minutes is rough, as it's mostly montage of characters doing ""teenage"" things, and the acting from some of the younger cast members falls pretty flat here. The film picks up with the introduction of the real premise: Molly and Amy want to prove that they aren't as boring as they appear. This provides enough of a foundation to carry the rest of the movie - though one or two scenes near the end don't work and should have been cut.The characters are written to be over-the-top (which is fine). The problem is that they're over-the-top in ways that don't really work for the purposes of comedy or character development. For example, both main characters are absorbed with many different social justice causes, but this aspect of their personalities is taken to such an extreme it seems at times like the film is mocking them. To be clear, I don't think it intends to do this, which leaves this whole aspect of the movie in limbo. On on hand, the film can't use the many scenes that illustrate their interest in social justice for any serious or dramatic purpose because they're just too unrealistic. On the other, they aren't really funny either because the film doesn't find any risky humor in them being ""too"" attached to those causes. The same is true for most of the other characters as well: they're weird, wild, and fun, but they're not weird, wild, and fun versions of high school students. So while the movie gets a lot of mileage out of the funny characters, it never quite feels like a comedy about high schoolers.The soundtrack doesn't help at all; it's one of the worst I've heard recently. That's not because the songs themselves are bad - there are two (misused) tracks by Run the Jewels that I like, and a score by Dan the Automator - the problem is that the editor used the songs as a blunt instrument to set the mood. There's no personality to the music and it adds nothing to the movie. It's as if they had a quiet playlist and a loud playlist, and they picked random songs from each to play behind different scenes as appropriate. As a result, the worst parts of this movie are a sort of high school version of a trailer for ""Bad Moms"".I do want to return to what for me was the most important thing, which is that most of the comedy does land. The worst thing for a comedy is to be dumb or boring, and so for me the success in this area covers a number of sins in others. The parts of the movie that work are charming and whimsical, and the portrayal of the friendship between the two leads is nicely executed. It succeeds in making a simple point near the end about the dangers of stereotyping which, although a little hamfisted, gives the film as a whole a nice structure that allows for some character development. You could do so much worse in a teen comedy, and so I recommend seeing Booksmart to fans of the genre or if you like Beanie Feldstein.",Booksmart

You have these two bestfriends who are super dedicated to school and are on their way to have fun for the first time in their lives. It is so incredibly relatable AND realistic.
Not only does it have a take on all the doubts and fears teenagers have when they go into the world for the first time ever, it also steps on so many stupid stereotypes.

The characters are nonsensical, the adults are absent or laughably ludicrous, and the jokes are so the final death knell to Lineorama style comedy. This movie is why we can't have nice coming of age comedies. The relationship between the two leads is sweet at times and then so painfully staged and written and overly directed at times that it's cringeworthy. I can't for the life of me understand how people are falling over themselves to say how great this is.Except for a few solid scenes, this is one of the most trite things ever put on the big screen.And the music is incessant. It comes every 10 seconds to try to punctuate a scene that fell flat because there was no truth to it.This makes Can't Hardly Wait look like a cinematic masterpiece.

393,livitsanis,"Booksmart is Blissful, Beautiful, Brilliant",10,27 May 2019,"This stupendous solid gold masterpiece is superior to pretty much every teen high school comedy that precedes it. You don't loftily intellectualise emotional responses to movies. You feel it right away. You know when a film works. It's a vibrant, energetic sensation that lifts you up and has you floating away on a cloud of delight. That's how I felt as soon as Booksmart began and I stayed on that cloud for the whole movie and didn't come down for several hours. I'm still there, actually. Every time I recall a stereotype- shattering moment from this piece of genius I float up a little higher.From the first scene with Molly and Amy dance-greeting each other I was with the movie all the way. I get this completely. I know exactly what this movie is doing and I love it in every way possible. These characters are alive and real in a way that high school movie teens almost never are. They still inhabit a stylised movie world but their interactions are so precise and witty that every clever exchange reminded me how so few movies even try to be this smart or funny, especially when it comes to how TEENAGE GIRLS are depicted in teen comedies.This movie shows how it should be done. Most movies are intended to fulfill fantasies, right? But they only fulfill a very narrow range of fantasies. Finally here's a movie - ONE movie - that comes close to presenting the world as it should be. Where people are multi-dimensional, where no one is a one-sided caricature, where everyone has layers and nuance and rich full lives that can't be summed up in cheap, lazy assumptions. I hope that in a few years there are many more movies that do what Booksmart does. I'm impossibly grateful for what Olivia Wilde and everyone involved in Booksmart have achieved. Contradiction in terms it might be, but this is an instant classic. It's wonderful.",Booksmart

I genuinely believe this will be a teen classic in the years to come. (Probably not a cult classic because it doesn't have a unique feel to it in terms of style but it's still a well done film)It's a comedy, it deserves to be analyzed as one (and not by comparing it to Superbad or Bridesmaids.)

396,seymourpantaloons,Overrated,5,3 April 2021,"Nobody is likeable and there isn't much good humour. The leads are great at reminding me of the worst kinds of girls in high school, but I don't enjoy remembering them. They're quirky activists who suck up and look down on fun. I understand that they have to start out as Lisa Simpson impersonators, but it's just annoying. And there really isn't much change in their characters, so you just know that they'll go back to being annoying in college next year.Another problem is that this movie grounds itself in real life way too hard. Mean Girls and Superbad are both fantastical the whole time, but the characters are still likeable and real. This characters in this movie remind me too much of real high school kids. It's not fun anymore, it's just obnoxious. And it's not realistic enough to be praised for that either, it's just annoyingly accurate to real life. Maybe if it was funnier, it could get a pass for the obnoxious accuracy.There's not really a point to this movie. They go for a midway friendship twist like Superbad, but I hated both of the characters involved so it wasn't important. And you just know that they're going to get back together, because Superbad did the exact same thing in 2007.This movie was predictable, annoying, and honestly just boring.

The rich cute boy with the lack of taste and the false reputation for sleeping with prostitute then who had almost no one show up to his graduation party tore up my heart until he got his redemption at the graduation ceremony.

The story was one we have seen before, but the writing had enough twists and the cast was energetic and believable. It was almost derailed by the intrusive, nonstop hiphop music that simply did NOT belong on this film. Maybe the producers loved that style of music or something, but none of the characters even mentioned such music. As a matter of fact two main characters make a point about how much the love classic and Broadway musicals. But every few moments we had to endure this ridiculous music. This film would have been better suited with high energy pop, some classic new wave, maybe even 80s tunes. The girls are funny and have genuine chemistry and it's better than it really has any right to be. Look forward to seeing more from the people involved, just hold the hiphop next time.",Booksmart

415,cpuser999,"Very good for what it is, but it could have used one final edit.",8,31 May 2019,"I quite enjoyed it, and the audience I saw it with did too. Olivia Wilde for more or less her directorial debut in a mainstream release keeps the audience engaged with chemistry-driven dialogue or action.The problem I saw, as a film editor myself, is that the film seemed to have been finished or rushed out and used as least one more draft.Two major problems that should have been cut:1. Some of the jokes just don't land. Many of the interactions with parents or the kid hosting the murder mystery party, the jokes just didn't register with me or the audience. Anything that doesn't push the story should be CUT, rewritten, or reshot, or a combination of those.2. The chemistry between the two leads was great, but there were WAYYYYY too many extreme close ups on the girls' faces. They dominate almost every scene and it seems like the cinematographer has a compulsion towards framing faces REALLY REALLY CLOSE. While film has matured over the years, you do need to mix it up with a share of wide establishing shots once in a while, medium shots, OTS, high/low angle, etc. 90% of the film is ECU on the mains, and it leaves a different memory of the film than what I think Wilde was intending.I've heard people say this was a female version of Superbad. Superbad was based on real events in the lives of the writers (Seth and Evan), but this script seemed to be contrived from THAT story. And sometimes, a copy of a copy is not really as good as the original. Several scenes worked very similarly, with almost identical mechanics to SB. There was a lot of fresh, intelligent, female-empowering, and yes even controversial dialogue, but the source material could have refrained from attempting to look like it was 'covering up a stolen plot' and gone off on its own direction a bit.Still, if the film were to be re-edited following the two points I made above, audiences may be forgiving in an era of remakes, sequels, spinoffs and flat-out copycat films.",Booksmart
416,Burgess_Kris,Fairly Decent,7,29 December 2019,"A comedy coming of age film with female leads is refreshing and looked like a promising follow on from Superbad and Project X.

418,riddhimanroy,Funny and Heartwarming,9,21 August 2021,Booksmart is an amazing teen comedy of our ages. There is never a single dull moment throughout. It showcases Olivia Wilde's talent as a director. The core theme of the film feels so authentic and relatable. It takes us on a nostalgic ride by deeply exploring the beauty of high school friendships and their complications. Also the story excels at so many levels and is backed up by great performances. The awkward jokes are all so incredibly hilarious and play so well with the context. I would absolutely recommend this for anyone.,Booksmart
419,kobe_q,Feminist Superbad,9,5 June 2019,"It's not very original to compare this movie to Superbad but what can you do?This movie has all the makings of a bad movie - just like Superbad.This movie has two main protagonists who (either) want to get laid or get drunk.There is police involved and a lot of unintentional scenarios with random people giving lifts to said protagonists.All is just like Superbad.It's raunchy as hell, there is a lot of talk about masturbation and there is a sex scene with vomit.But it's also a good movie - just like Superbad was.Only thing is, I'm a guy. I can relate to that, while it's a lot harder for me to relate to this.All things said, Superbad was a good movie and relatable to a lot of people.
This movie is just good. Maybe it's equally relatable but less so for the regular moviegoer.Still, I recommend you to see this one. Of all the movies with a feminist twist these days this one makes sense and is very funny.",Booksmart

By OlIvia Munn Booksmart is one of the best comming of age movies iv ever seen (and iv seen a lot). I could go on for days about how good this Movie is... It's hilarious, Charming, Extremelly well acting and most of all, relevant.
Despite what you think of this generation of Comming of agers, this is the movie they deserve.
Yes, it's got a similar premise to superbad and they are both comming of age movies with very similar set ups...but this movie stands on it's own two feet. It's not a ""Rip off"" by any means, this movie gives a voice to characters that usually wouldn't be given a voice. It has something for everyone to relate to.
Plus, it has Jason Sudekis in his funniest role for years!

It's definitely NOT that. If you go in expecting the teen version of a Judd Apatow movie, you're not going to get that. It's much more fitting in the vein of John Hughes, but for 2019.Also this movie is very specifically targeted at young Millennials and Gen Zers. If you don't get it, that's probably why. It's not a film for everybody, and that's fine.Olivia Wilde's directorial debut is extremely solid. Her tone is great.

The first review I saw here (also titled ""I don't get it"" and also 5 stars, summed up my feelings, so I won't repeat all that it said. (Except, and I suppose a minor point, but as that other review mentioned, some of the actors are way too old for the roles, e.g., Billie Lourd is 27 and looks 27.) And it strains plausibility at times. (Miss Fine just happened to have a sequined dress in Beanie Feldstein's size in her car?)I read two glowing reviews, on AVClub and Vulture, and it has a 97% critical consensus on RottenTomatoes, so clearly critics are liking it. I just don't understand why.I don't have know how many times I've seen Lady Bird, a far superior high school movie (in which Beanie F. costarred). This isn't a bad movie; it's a bit scattered tonally, and I kept reading that the characters weren't the usual high school stereotypes and were fleshed out, when actually that's not true.It is...mildly witty. I guess see it and see what you think if you're curious. Word of mouth will be the ultimate determination of its success. For me, it's vastly overhyped.",Booksmart

It tries to be all three and loses some of it's identity.I think although it was trying to be mature it's audience is the late teens. I should have loved this film, I normally love this genre but my attention kept wandering. Everytime it tried to be poignant or sentimental it suddenly had to good out not allowing it's true meaning to come through.

I've not seen a single in between review which really described what I felt watching this movie. I don't even think this is gonna be read by anyone, but I just want to get this of my heart.While watching a movie I have never ever felt as embarrassed as I have been watching this one. Trust me if you can make fun of yourself and just absurd parts of the movie without finding it bad, you're gonna enjoy this one. But I also get the point some others mentioned, that they don't get what should be so funny about the movie. Some parts are just fun because of the absurd lines the actors say to each other and some are hilarious because the story is so absurdly unrealistic. And while some might criticize that, it's exactly what I can laugh about. In the end I rate a movie by how much it has entertained me and this movie did a good job at that.I won't tell anyone not to listen to the critics because they sure have they points and rating this movie in a coming up age genre it sure is a good one, trying to entertain with a just a tiny bit of depth. I also understand the people who hate the movie and give one star reviews because they thought it was crap and they just couldn't enjoy the absurdity of the movie. I rarely get both sides of the coin but this movie is the first one I truly do.I laughed so loud I woke my family up and I fell back into my chair finding it really hard to keep my eyes on the monitor.

Most high school comedy movies aren't capable of providing an allusive plot with interesting characters that can actually make an audience laugh. Not did this movie make me laugh hysterically but also make me feel a more serious tone about relationships, growing up, and fitting in. I generally don't watch many comedies due to their inability to provoke me into really caring about the story. Booksmart stayed well structured and well oriented, there were never moments that felt overly played out or trying to create unnecessary moments to evoke a laugh. This movie also has a great soundtrack to accompany the awkwardness and real-ness of our characters. It's directed beautiful displaying all the right ideas/themes at all the right movements.

The jokes are funny, the lead actresses are great together and the pacing and editing are perfect, even the photography is really nice. Enjoyed the small roles played by big names in comedy, a nice bonus if you like their work in SNL and other movies. The humor and characters' personalities represent teenagers today very accurately, especially in los ángeles, as well as superbad did when it came out. Times change and it seems the people giving this film bad reviews are people who want things to stay the same as they were when they were young and it's rather sad this mentality prevents them from enjoying a decent film.

And surprisingly the best part was not even the humor but the warmth found between the characters that, I think, subverts the expectations of most high school coming of age comedies. Love and fun and true friendship that reminded me of the joy of being in high school...how damn much your friends mean to you at that time, and the silly times you had. By bringing surprise with the character, and getting to the warmth between the characters, I found some scenes downright transcendent with joy, especially the ending sequences. I think the use of music was also so well played. The scene where Amy dives into the pool, with the use of the song, is actually poetic. After finishing the movie, I watched the whole thing again.

How about we make an original funny movie with female leads instead of a ripping off something that people will compare the film to?

Was laughing all the way through and thought the performances had good depth- appreciated all the characters and memorable moments.

Hilarity ensues. It actually does too. The film is impressively funny. It's not a great art piece but it is highly amusing and it delivers in being funny.The main and ensemble characters are quite human, likeable and funny.

453,yungnoclout,Made me want to bash my head into a wall,4,25 May 2020,"Booksmart wears its inspirations on its sleeve and fails to meet the quality of any films that it's *heavily* inspired by. The movie is essentially an indie girl version of Superbad and it's so infuriating to watch because you hate everyone in the movie. At least if the writing had some self-awareness of how awful the people are in this movie it might not have been so bad, but it doesn't have that, the movie is blissfully ignorant of how terrible its characters are, while simultaneously trying to make you feel bad for them at the climax of the movie. I think the cast does a decent job considering what was given to them, but the writing is so bad that even a top tier performance couldn't save it.Olivia Wilde's directing style is non-existent, the cinematography is basic and generic, the production design is bland, and everything is predictable; this movie just feels like a low effort Netflix original with a ""progressive and inclusive"" twist.Some people might like this movie, but the critic's ratings of it are not accurate at all. It had a couple funny moments, but the film is fundamentally lazy in its inception and execution; the plot is a carbon copy of Superbad but executed way worse on every level. It genuinely blows my mind that 4 grown adults collaborated on this screenplay together and this was the best they could muster up.Just because a movie has some political undertones that you agree with doesn't make it a good movie.",Booksmart

455,jsalinas-22364,"Superbad, if it were super-meh",5,23 April 2020,"I'm a massive cinephile, and I always try to watch as many underrated movies of the year as well as the most popular. I'm the kind of person who will watch anything as long as it sounds interesting to me. I heard that this movie was considered one of the most underrated movies of the year, so I decided to check it out. Overall, it ended up being a mediocre movie with a few good things in it, almost as if Olivia Wilde watched Superbad and tried putting a progressive spin on it.Starting off with the pros of the movie, our 2 lead characters. While they're not as charismatic as other better teen comedy protagonists, Beanie Feldstein and Katelyn Dever have a fun and endearing chemistry that makes them quite easy to root for. In fact, a couple of other characters manage to be admittedly likable, even if they didn't have much showtime. And I'm sure Amy will make an excellent role model for LGBT teens thanks to her confidence and self-acceptance of that aspect.Unfortunately, the 2 main characters are the main good thing I can think of (except for one thing I'll mention later). The movie's main problem is that it doesn't capture the true essence of high school horrors. The awkwardness is very scripted and forced, the jokes are nowhere near as funny as people said they were (I didn't laugh once, except for one joke that admittedly had an amusing payoff), the other high school characters are unrealistic and played by actors who are very obviously not teens anymore (or close anyway), and aside from Amy and her love interest, the rest of the gay characters seemingly exist only to add more progressive appeal. Long story short, the movie is not an immersive, relatable experience; it's just a regular movie.However, there was one moment of the movie that I'll admit was not only, but great, and that's the pool scene. Everything about it was flawless: the cinematography, the lighting, the acting, the music (especially considering the rest of the film's rather generic soundtrack), and its emotional resonance resulting from all of the above. Plus, it leads up to one notable game-changer in the plot that I cannot spoil. This scene alone was a masterpiece in an otherwise mediocre movie; it could've even worked as a standalone short film!To conclude, forgettable teen comedy a little too reminiscent of better films of its genre. But it definitely still has great leads, positive representation, and proof that director Olivia Wilde has got more filmmaking potential.",Booksmart

I had not seen any ads nor looked at reviews - thankfully not at the reviews on here. Maybe the ads/previews make this look like a typical, fluff, teen party movie, I don't know. I kind of thought that's what it was going to be. I was so surprised! This movie is wicked, sweet, smart, sarcastic, fun! We laughed - a lot. The soundtrack even was fun. The cameos cracked me up. The girls cracked me up.Is it perfect? No, but it's really good. There are a couple things to quibble about, but it's meant to be over the top, and scenes like ""the trip"" are just freaking creative!I agree with a review much farther down that if you aren't gen y or z, yeah you probably won't get it. However, we're boomers, and we get it. But we think we're pretty dang woke, so there is that. There's a subtext to the negative reviews on here, and they won't come out and say it, and probably would even deny it. That's all I'll say about that.I am not a studio shill.

I've been seeing this movie as an option for a long time but always avoided it so when it randomly came on I didn't expect to be laughing and enjoying this so much. The writing and acting is good.

475,Lailinia,I get it. I'm sorry you don't.,8,2 January 2020,"There are so many reviewers saying that they don't get Booksmart, as they were expecting it to be like other final-day-of-highschool movies like Superbad or Dazed and Confused (which are both great). And Booksmart does, in fact, succeed in being a funny, extremely relatable, and inventive addition to that category. As someone who graduated high school in 2017 and was in pretty much the same situation as Amy, this movie hit me hard and I really really enjoyed it. Does it follow a familiar premise? Yes, but this is the first mainstream, female led, LGBTQ+ coming of age film to do so. Maybe it doesn't resonate with you because you graduated high school a while ago, maybe because you're not a woman or LGBTQ+, or maybe you just don't think it's funny (which are all valid reasons, you're totally entitled to your own opinion), but if you say you don't ""get it"", at least try to understand that Booksmart is actually a really important film for my generation, women, queer people, and those of us who may have wasted too much time worrying about what's next rather than ever slowing down to enjoy high school. Booksmart is a lot more than just some dumb screwball comedy, it has a lot of heart and I know that those who ""get it"" really get it. Also it's not ""woke"" or pandering to have a diverse cast.",Booksmart
476,bhardwajajit12,A Self-Righteous yet Great Coming-of-Age Fun,9,25 August 2019,"I haven't got anything bad to say about the movie except that it could've been more well paced, through the middle it feels like dragging for a bit there but before and after it's just pure joy. Exhilarating

and Noah Galvin is an actor to watch for!",Booksmart

Haters gonna hate, but most of these low-scoring reviews are written by illiterate snowflakes. As Gigi would do, I give them all the middle finger dance 😘",Booksmart
478,Dreamer_Disease,I'm Superbad At Being Booksmart,8,25 May 2019,"Is it wrong to say that I didn't see all of Superbad? In truth, I was never one for teen movies. Nowadays I would say I relate more to Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, so that reveals my age. The film Booksmart is a lot more modern and plenty stupider, but in this case, it's not a bad thing as it's a laugh riot. More like it would start one I'm not sure which. I watched a few people walk out on the advance screening I saw. It won't be everyone's cup of tea.If you liked Superbad and said to yourself, ""what if the leads were girls,"" then you have Booksmart. The same basic tropes, partying, looking to hook-up and plans over the summer. Minus the fetch quest for alcohol. Some adventures got left out of the trailer. You could be one of those types that watched Freaks and Geeks. You might have said it was a more accurate representation of any high school. More than say Saved By The Bell. My school days are long past, but I buy Booksmart more than Zack Morris no question. Are you only looking for a laugh with some funny women? Kaitlyn Dever ""Amy"" and Beanie Feldstein ""Molly"" bring it. Should I be thanking Olivia Wilde and Will Ferrell instead? The movie's cast was new to me except for Billie Lourd ""Gigi,"" Lisa Kudrow ""Amy's Mom"" and Jessica Williams ""Ms. Fine.""As for what you know, two smart girls are all Fuddy-duddy for four years. Then they discover this netted them nothing. Yes everyone appears to have bright shining futures ahead of them as well. Who would bother to bribe their way into college, yeah I couldn't resist. So with four years of no mistakes. Molly the pushy one and Amy the reserved intend to make all the crappy decisions they can. On one night at one party and so let the hilarity ensue. There is also a touch of The Breakfast Club. Only not resigned to the school. Yes, we are meeting several characters throughout the last day of their class. And the morning after.Don't get your hopes up; there are a few promises of sex. The humor is all over the place, and if you've ever looked at a Barbie, a particular type of way *drools*. Nope, there won't be any nudity. Still, I wouldn't advise bringing the kids unless their headed high school way. I would call this movie an original piece, but somebody was a fan of the genre. Again, if you put these girls against the Superbad guys, I think you would have one great movie. It would work out.Choosing between the two leads of Molly and Amy, I couldn't. So I pick Gigi. Lisa Kudrow doesn't have more than ten minutes. Jessica Williams will bring a bit more naughtiness. Only Billie Lourd's character popped up everywhere and often. Other characters were a bit underdeveloped and were the standard stereotypes. The jock, the drama geeks. The ""Village Bicycle"" though that's harsh as I'm talking about a high school movie. Gossip, and rumors, attempting my impression of a movie critic?Now there is a lack of most character stories in part to be sure. Such friendship building shows brilliantly. You see Molly and Amy, who are besties at the start; you see how they both come into their own. Then run back to each other with everything happening. Jared and Gigi were another. Especially when you hear how Jared tells it and talks about a relationship. I won't spoil any of these for you, because I'm not that kind of guy. Second, you saw some coming, and others were like okay a twist. Some we hear about on the news, but again this was high school driven. So when ""him"" and ""her"" come together well, the ending adds a bit to the humor. As always though people always find something to complain about these days, don't we all know right.Again Gigi was my favorite, and I adore Molly and Amy. Only the Pizza Delivery Guy played by Michael Patrick O'Brien. He reminds me how most people look at my studies. Relax I'm a writer and when the guy was talking which was in the trailer. Let's say he knows a lot about certain things. Principal Brown acted by Jason Sudeikis, might resonate with teachers if Ms. Fine doesn't. Though as a guy, most guys are asking, ""where is my Ms. Fine?"" Principal Brown had one of the funniest scenes when it comes to the ""mechanics"" of sex and finances. There's no over the top sexualization of women. Well unless we're talking about toys again showing the range of the leads. Still, they were in the roles of high schoolers.For a movie full of new faces for me, while not mind-blowing if I saw them in another film, I'd be that more inclined to watch it. Now I don't mean to offend anybody, though truth be told if it wasn't for the free ticket? It did open me up to a whole new genre since the last ""teenage"" oriented movies I cared to see. They were about rebellion and dystopian futures. I watched the young women from those franchises blowup into household names. For these women, they indeed show so much promise no doubt.If this were Fandango, I would give it a four out of five stars. So that's what eight in IMDB and don't get me started on Rotten Tomatoes as with the state of schools. That's something I don't quite understand yet, not that Booksmart is confusing at all. The highest praise I can give this is the fact that I would have paid to see it. Only no promises I'll go and see it again, but the point is I'm thinking about it. Warning, you should turn away now if you don't want a taste of the spoilers. I'm finally going to lay down here.As for a favorite scene, I'll have to go with the pizza place because it reminds me of my job. Not pizza, again writing and how the guy explained all the things that could happen to Molly and Amy. You figured that was way too much information, I've heard the term skeevy for a lot less. Again Gigi, nothing but love, still with the funniest scene involves something of hers. The aftermath of Molly and Amy as dolls. Amy is getting into herself with the prospect of remaining in such a form. The ending is a bit lacking but quite sweet, one of those gushy moments. I laughed during the credits; the wrong generation ha.Unless you're sure of the ""maturity"" of your kids, they should stay home. Now as for those first-year students and of course, seniors. Both high school and life will laugh their heads off at this movie. Your grandpa might have a few choice words. I'm not that old. Now the Mothers and daughters who have that BFF type of relationship? Wow was Molly sort of like Amy's mom; what Amy's actual mom did with that panda. Hell, what Amy did with that panda. Something they should have shown, okay I'm back they were good girls. Despite Amy getting arrested for helping everybody. The only thing I can say I didn't like about this movie is along the lines of standing with Molly. That everybody getting drunk, high, and plenty stupid got into college. Imagine Modern Family. Haley and Dylan are getting into the same school as Alex and not only that but graduating with honors.Of course who was looking for realism? Though Booksmart has a basis in reality or I hope so but my time is long past. Perhaps that's the best thing this movie did is give me feelings of nostalgia for my days in school. For now, at least I can't say I'm Superbad At Being Booksmart.",Booksmart
479,starksjason,Thinks it's Superbad... is just super-bad,8,4 June 2019,"With the exception of the leads being female, this film doesn't even try to disguise itself from being a blatant rip-off of Superbad.I liked it ok.

I just wanted to say, that I thought this movie was terrific. Kaitlyn dever was amazing as always. Beinie feldstien was great too and billie lourd was hilarious.It is reminiscent of Superbad, which I love. However, in Superbad, the characters all end up getting exactly what they want. This movie does have a happy end but the characters don't get exactly what they've been hoping for throughout. I'm sorry but when it looked like molly was going to get with nick, I couldn't help but think that would never happen in reality. A bit like Emma stone and Jonah hill getting together.If you actually think the movie is bad based on something other than you just don't get it or it's not your sense of humour. And you'd like to stop others from disappointment, then you should leave a review. If you simply didn't get it, I don't know why you're here.

This is one of the best coming of age comedies I have ever seen. Brilliant on so many levels: casting, script, soundtrack, and most of all, direction. Who knew Olivia Wilde had this talent? Characters are developed and their individual quirks are endearing. You get pulled along for a fast paced joyride through their last night before graduation. Yes, the high school students look better and older and have more confidence than in real life, but the actors make it work. If you can look at this with a youthful heart you will be in for a very enjoyable movie that can make you laugh and cry and feel better than you did. ""Booksmart"" looks smart.",Booksmart
483,HumphreyLebowsky,Surprisingly mature and beautiful,9,12 February 2020,"The protagonists are two very hardworking girls, they are surrounded by what seem to be steriotyped highschool teenagers. This movie overcame my expectations when the steriotypes are revealed to be masks that those teens use to hide their own insecurity, the movie really explores the complexities of the personalities of each one. It is not an idiot teen movie, it discuss every kind of subjects, like friendship, social acceptance, love rejection and much more. This is the first movie ever directed by Olivia WIlde, it is a great start, she is clearly very talented. There is this absurdly beautiful long shot near the end that shows all the talent as a director Olivia has.
The connection between the two friends is great, the way they see the world is very reasonable considering their age and experience.

It could be implied that the parents of Molly's slacker peers were complicit in the College Admissions Scandal in which the elite and wealthy parents of underperforming high school students were exposed for paying bribes in order to get their kids accepted into Ivy League schools.

That's probably because the chemistry didn't translate well onto the screen. And then there was just too much trying to be forced in I think, and taken to extremes. I mean, two smart girls who all of a sudden think they need to go out and party hard because others they considered stupid or unmotivated made it into good colleges, like that's all that matters? Then a lot of little things, like how the first party they end up at is >completely< void of people beyond the two hosts. Then, even though neither girl is rich, they leave gift bags with iPads behind? Heck, I'd be stuffing a bunch from other bags into mine before I took off!! Then the drugs that they unknowingly took so long before all of a sudden kick in at the same time on both of them, and although they're hit hard by them, they wear off at the exact same time just outside the party they were at. And the scenes with the principal and graduation scene, like where the car arrives. A bit too much, who can drive around town like that, bust through a fence and not have anyone say a word?Don't get me wrong, I laughed, found it entertaining, but it's never going to live up to classics like Superbad or American Pie.

Beanie Feldstein, Billie Lourd, Molly Gordon and all the cast were funny and made me laugh with their various characters. I literally lost it at some points and missed two scenes ahead because of that. The story was straightforward and it didn't fail to make me laugh.

In the 80s it was so common to come across to films that were supposed to be real telling stories about teens trying to go through their stuff, but, although I love some of them, they seemed very phony.

As if a person turned a corner into real life when finalizing the confrontation with puberty. Huh-uh. We lead rich and complex lives when we're 10. We lead rich and complex lives when we're 50. What consensus society throws at us, we deal with. We are all human and we are all dealing with it. Anyhow, I digress.

That is the only way to explain the countless raving ""professional"" reviews for this sophomoric drivel. From the creepy long shots lingering on teenage bodies (lots of up the shots) in the swimming pool to the idiotic dance Scene that seems to be prerequisite for quite a few movies associated with Will Ferrell, this movie really tapped into those hackneyed techniques. Visually pretty, good trailer, and a few refreshing characters introduced (then not developed effectively), but downright irritating much of the time.

I can only think that the bad reviews here are trying to balance out the super positive ones. Because there's no way that many people couldn't find it funny. Aside from the excellent visual storytelling and filmmaking, the soundtrack was also brilliant. Dan the Automater chose a bevy of obscure tracks that enhance the atmosphere and narrative expertly.Here's how I see the movie: American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, Dazed and Confused, American Pie (a seniors graduating comedy that everyone saw), Superbad, and Booksmart.",Booksmart

How cheap can a writing get ? How could a writer make such a choice ? It was the best part of the movie and they ruined it. They ruined it ! It was such a predictable turn out of events. Tease the viewer with the possibility of seeing a very funny yet cathartic lesbian sex scene and then take it all away in the most anti-climatic of fashions. Urgh!This movie sucks.",Booksmart
516,erik_eklof,"An exaggerated, well directed, and fun introspection on the emotions of one's teenage years",8,2 September 2021,"I remember thinking to myself when this movie first came out, that while it piqued my interest, it simply didn't look like a movie that was made for me. Similarly to how an action movie about well-dressed gentlemen smoking cigars and driving sports cars isn't exactly *made* for teenage girls. It's not that teenage girls can't enjoy a movie like that, or that I wasn't going to enjoy this movie. It just didn't seem like something that would be tailored for me. So I put off watching it for the longest time. Once I finally began watching, I went into it with that attitude... ""No... this isn't really made for me."" And for the first few minutes, that's how I thought the whole film was going to be like. Boy, was I wrong.Booksmart, while most definitely exaggerated in places when compared to most real-life instances, accurately captures and brings forth the emotion and the atmosphere of life as a teenager. One empathizes genuinely with the involved characters because the involved characters are *you*! (Or at least once upon a time, they were...)I was particularly hard-struck by what I would describe as the most concise recollection of young love I've ever seen, heard, or experienced so far. The pool scene. In one fell swoop, we are brought through the full spectrum of young love from start to finish. Witnessing the love interest of the story take off their clothes in front of the main character from a (rare for this film) point-of-view shot, which really emphasizes the feelings of admiration, particularly 'from the outside'.The euphoric and dream-like excitement of falling in love, represented by the ever-striking Kaitlyn Dever slowly drifting through the ethereal waters of the in-ground pool with a smile on her face - putting the natural work of art that is the female form on the pedestal it deserves to be put on. Perfume Genius' 'Slip Away' acts as the perfect amplifier, turning the visual dream to an exciting audiovisual experience. The energy, the tempo, the monumentality, followed by meditational breaks and pauses, perfectly punctuates this once-in-a-lifetime defining experience for this character. And as the score builds, and the piano begins to play, she discovers the worst possible outcome - her love interest, the girl she's after, is mooching on her absolute best friend's love interest. Heartbreak.One Scene. One Experience. One Fell Swoop.In just the same way this scene captures young love, the whole film captures youth. A genuine and authentic, though exaggerated exploration of the emotions surrounding teenage experiences.Thank you, Ms. Olivia Wilde & Co. For providing me with this retrospective on the years I won't get back. It was beautiful, it was painful, it was defining. Thank you for proving me wrong.",Booksmart

Ironic that these productions are filled with people who didn't want to go to college. It's actually insulting to most colleges and college graduates in the world. (Now that that ramble is over) This movie was absolutely hilarious. The cast was great and we didn't have to deal with famous cast trying to experiment with themselves in an independent film. The girls are brilliant. The school is realistic. The parties are realistic. People don't bully you as a group at parties. They just don't. They think the bully is a jerk too. (Spoiler) Thankfully this movie didn't do that. It's a phenomenal film. Olivia Wilde should be proud. The movie made me feel like they talked to actual young people about the dialogue. Why it's not a bigger deal is beyond me. It's a female Superbad, but smarter. The world seems to fight against an all-lead girl cast being funny but they won't win.

As a current high school student, I found it hilarious and relatable. The only un-relatable aspect of this film was that a ton of kids got into ivy league schools, which oftentimes is not the case. When I walked out of the theater, I wanted to yell, ""Finally! An accurate depiction of Gen Z kids! No more 'phone bad book good' stories and let us rejoice because they didn't make social media the focal gimmick of the entire film!"" As someone who cares a great deal about their schoolwork, the possibility that I am wasting my youth away on SAT prep and studying is a persistent and scary idea, one that doesn't always get portrayed in a real, honest way. This isn't a 'nerds-gone-wild' movie. It's a story about an incredible female friendship, one that is not corrupted by tropes or toxicity. I already recommend this movie to nearly everyone who asks for a recommendation, but I understand that this kind of film isn't for everyone. So. If you enjoyed Ladybird, Superbad, and/or the show Gilmore Girls, you will probably like this movie. If you love strong female relationships, you will probably like this movie.

Their classmates have been written in a way that veers away from crueller, crasser archetypes found in the likes of Mean Girls and American Pie.

With that said, it's not as good as any of them.I did think there were a lot of funny moments, though and I think the overall plot was good. I laughed out loud at the dance moves at the beginning and I could def relate to Molly waiting for her crush to return to her at a party and then he ghosted her another girl.But certain things really bothered me that made me give this a lower score than it might've been.Right off the bat was, why are these kids wearing turtlenecks, tights, blazers and layers in Los Angeles in May/ June?Also where were Molly's parents? And why was Molly -- 17/ 18 years old -- the one who got Amy out of jail? In real life, she would have at least had one of her own parents with her to help (if Amy didn't want hers knowing where she was).Similarly, why was it MOLLY who dropped Amy off at the airport? Realistically, Amy's parents would've been the ones to do it (and they probably would've gone into the airport to wait with her at the terminal).And don't even get me started about the girls changing into Miss Fine's clothes in the back of the car and they just happen to fit (Jessica Williams is 6' tall).It's little unrealistic bits like this that could easily have been dealt with and made the film better than it was.

I also especially liked how quirky Kailyn Dever's character was.The music stood out to me and I had to check the soundtrack list after to save some to my playlist.The only negative I can think of is that there might be a few to many sex jokes about one character in particular.The plot is not the most original but it has enough going for it to stand out.

The comedy aspect of the movie is just badly done and trying to make it fit as a comedy makes it feel like it doesn't work overall.

FUNNY... CHARMING... wonderfully SINCERE little gem.Maybe the people who ""don't get it"" are only fresh out of high school. Maybe they're dudes, dwelling in the basement and clueless to nuances of female friendship. Maybe it's both? I don't know.But as thirtysomething man who hated high school and loves to hear my straight-laced wife reminisce about all of the earnestly goofy, silly things she and her friends did when left to their own devices back in the day, I feel like this movie perfectly hit on that cross-section between what high school was really like, and what people wish it could have been.The two leads are unassumingly charming, and their friendship is one of the most accurate portrayals I can recall in recent memory. Also, the movie had me laughing out loud.This is a film that sees high schoolers as they are, rather than what they're idealized as, and those calling it an ""inferior Superbad knock-off"" are ignoring the unique foibles this film has, just as that overly-glossy (but still really well-made) film has a unique take on its friendship it portrays. There's room to allow both to be good, people.This movie is the real deal. All a movie REALLY needs to do to succeed is suspend an audience's disbelief, and this one made me feel like I got to know specific, intimate details of two people's personality to the point that I feel like I know that as well as my own friends... except unlike my friends, they don't actually exist. That's a level of character development that only 5 out of 100 movies ever achieve.Whatever. It's a good movie. A total classic.

Its really a shame so many movies are implementing this ""short attention span"" movie style with no time for build up and reflection.",Booksmart
569,deniskomaromi,"A solid, good movie if you're able to let yourself enjoy it",7,5 June 2021,"Not really original, some cliches are broken and many stay the same. The gay guys are overly sassy, the timid girl is timid, there's an argument between the best friends as is apparently necessary in every single one of these movies etc etc
There's a decent amount of jokes and most of them are pretty good. Some made me laugh fairly hard, others not much. Also was a bit cringey because it's another one of those high school movies where no one is a realistic highschooler, they're all clearly high school characters written by adults. Sometimes it works but most of the time it's a bit cringe.But it still manages to be pretty good in my opinion, if you're able to forgive the usual stuff that's wrong with this type of movie, it's still better than a lot of high school comedies.",Booksmart

571,dinakarallis,Ignore bad reviews this film is brilliant,10,8 February 2020,I haven't enjoyed a movie like this for a long time. Stop comparing it to other teen movies. It's a little different from your usual teen movie and it does not try to shock with too much sex and unnecessary gross out scenes. It's quirky and sweet and thoughtful with plenty of clever giggles. The two main characters were brilliant. I was actually sad to see it end. Loved it,Booksmart
572,modemaged,It's simply one of my favorite movies right now,10,21 April 2020,"Many would disagree with me, but take a closer look at the movie before judging it. Although it's a comedy movie, but bit for me it was way beyond just comedy. Yes I laughed so much in the movie,but the movie have also carried many lessons for me for example the idea of not having to work so hard when you can just be average and still have fun. Moreover, the real meanings of friendship with all the ups and downs and for the people who are willing to try new things they never experienced just for having fun and the courage to try getting close to the people you have a crush on and the many things that you discover while getting to try this things and that's what life is actually about.",Booksmart
573,Taxationistheft,Franz Ferdinand was executed better.,2,24 July 2019,"I hardly, if ever, review films. I can tolerate a good deal of Marvel stuff without a peep because it's basically just inoffensive and bland.
This was offensive and bland.Visually, the film is incredibly nice to look at with beautiful settings and a nicely composed vibrant atmosphere. The soundtrack is also pretty well put together and helps to convey the tone.Aside from those two elements, the film is lacklustre and milquetoast, with lazy writing and most of the humour stemming from awkward moments which (while delivered well) stop short of a substitute for actual humour. Something which helps a film like Superbad, which this film directly copies. As two characters, one meek and one obnoxious and overbearing traverse from one ill-fated party to the next in the hopes of finding the one party where they can both end highschool on a high note. In Superbad, the characters are redeemed of their traits as after the fight over the exact same quarrel in the film is resolved. The obnoxious character manages to relax and comes to terms with the world around him in a holistic way as the more timid characters have a more refined depth to them. With character development missing, the main duo in this flick are fuelled by their own narcissism in a way that leaves a sour taste in my mouth.Shots seem to linger on far longer than intended before cutting, without any purpose whatsoever. The side characters which are initially supposed to be mocked are infinitely more likeable and well rounded than the two here.I hope that the alternative ending (if someone put that much thought into this project) shows the final car ride ending a la Thelma and Louise.Save your money.",Booksmart

577,jiimusta,Very entertaining teen movie. Ingredients for a cult movie.,9,13 October 2020,"I didn't know anything about this movie when i decided to pick this for a movie night with some friends.
I was scrolling down the comedy list of a VOD service and just by reading the description of the movie, i gave it a try.
And surely it was fun to watch and very entertaining. The humour and mood were refreshingly ""off the beat"", which was a positive
surprise, because i had a slight doubts this one being just another teen movie smoosh à la Netflix.
Yes, it has a good amount of the classic jokes and gimmicks of a high school movie. It also has a variety of stereotypes from 80's and 90's high school movies.
But the thing, that made this movie good in my opinion, is the way director Wilde flips around those stereotypes to make things differ from the average.Some decent acting also from young actors, especially Kaitlyn Dever stood out. This is a good comedy movie about growing out from school, having a deep
friendship, getting some new friends and views of life. If one have enjoyed high school movies and teen comedies back in the day. I recommend this one.
I guess you'll get a little bit more out of this movie, if you happend to be a female.P.S. Ignore those 1/10 reviews, they are just He-bots botting around the net.",Booksmart

584,warrenurbina,Snoozefest,1,9 October 2020,"I might have laughed at a couple things but overall this movie had very poor character development. Seeing some characters appear from one party to the next all within the course of a night was not too immersive and felt weird. The story really doesn't have much depth to it and has a thematic message that overall bummed me out about future generations. Sure you can view the message as to ""not take life too seriously"". But the message I got was that it is okay to drink and do drugs in your youth. While that should not be scrutinized so hard I still think it should not be encouraged. Anyways, this movie gets a low rating because after watching it I was kinda mad that I did. And the theme did not sit well with me. And it did not make me laugh too much at all.",Booksmart

Sure - I get it but where Superbad was crass, Booksmart was not only funny, it was also honest, aspirational, fresh and genuine. It's not just a night of bad life decisions but how those decisions are part of one's life story, of one's success and growing. It also showcases an incredible friendship - the two leads are absolute stars and the ensemble provides some positive portrayals of folks who don't always get that type of screen time.

587,Pippip321,Too smart for its own good,5,8 February 2020,"Before seeing the film, I read a statement from Olivia Wilde discussing the film's poor performance at the box office, where she said something along the lines of ""people just don't get it, it's too intelligent"", and to an extent I agree. It's a coming of age comedy that is so aware of its own smartness and yet so predictable with it, that as someone who likes being wrong-footed by a film, to me the whole thing feels forced and dull, despite (or even perhaps because of) its oh-so-witty and bubbly surface persona. At its heart, it's actually that kid at school who discovers a cool band, then proceeds to buy the t-shirt, cap, and name drops said band into every single conversation. That's not to say there isn't merit in being deeply uncool as a film, but ultimately it's just not funny or enjoyable when you're being nudged repeatedly every time you're supposed to laugh, or react in a prescribed way. It's all just a bit cynical, precisely because it talks down to its audience. If you want an example of how to do this eternally-adolescent-millennials-tell-gen-z-ers-what's-cool genre with a degree of genuine wit and and heart, see the series Sex Education. *DISCLAIMER* This review was written by an eternally adolescent millennial who is just trying to grow the up.",Booksmart

589,rjrarrick,A Waste of Film Stock,1,31 October 2019,"It took me only 14 minutes to hate this movie.
Why?
1.) Molly, given her personality, would never be listening to a motivational tape that says, ""**** those losers.""
2.) Everyone in that high school acts like they are on acid. Which is ironic, as this happens to the girls, and on acid they still act more normal than their classmates. And acid does not wear off that quicky.
3.) In real life, everyone in high school knows where everyone else is going to college way before the final day of school. Especially if those students are going to Harvard and Stanford.
4.) Those students they showed going to Harvard, Yale, and Stanford were never getting into Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. Well, maybe Yale. That place is not impressive.
5.) No principal of a school sending that many students to top colleges has to drive uber. Principles in my district all make about 80 to 90 grand.
6. There was one good line, but I forgot it already.
7. I like the concept that the girls keep arriving at non parties, but not enough interesting is happening at them.
8. At 45 minutes I realized that this is just the high school girl version on ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle."" Replace White Castle with Nick's party. We need Doogie Houser in this movie.
9. I can't believe Olivia Mund went on all the talk shows pretending this was good.
10. The only thing keeping me watching this is to see if the movie somehow redeams itself before it is over.
11. Gigi looks like she's 35 years old, not a high school student.
12. I'm now looking for a setting on my laptop that will allow me to watch the final 40 minutes at double speed.
13. Ugh...I'm turning this off and watching the Knicks. And they suck.
14. My advice: Just watch ""Heathers"" instead.",Booksmart

The movie flows smoothly, with fun moments coming one after another, constantly. With a swath of SNL alums in side characters, and a strong cast making up the students, especially Beanie Feldstein who plays Amy. And of course all of this put really well together by debutante director Olivia Wilde.
This must have been talked about a lot, but my favorite aspect of the film is how inclusive and progressive the film is, while not being preachy at all. One of the lead characters is an out lesbian, but that's not the defining characteristic of the character, it just a person with a different sexual preference than her friend.
The film isn't a deep piece exploring teenage anxiety, FOMO, sexuality, etc. Its just a fun well made, well written, well acted film which gives the viewers a delightful time.",Booksmart

I saw a lot of the low reviews mention how there's alot of cursing or too many sexual references but unless you're in high school or teach it, you wouldn't know that that's literally how high schoolers talk to one another and these are the type of conversations they're choosing to have with one another. The film is definitely directed towards highschoolers or people who've just gotten out of it, taking in that all the people who lower rate it don't seem to understand the current dynamic of it all.

While boys prefer the amusement of sci-fi or the violence of action movies, girls tend to go for softer options, like romantic comedies for example. ""Booksmart"" belongs in this last category and no wonder it appeals to a young female audience; it has what any teenage girl would want: the prospect of acceptance by peers, the idea of everlasting friendship and romance, plus the confidence given by ""girl power"". As in most comedies where characters and situations may vary widely from real life, in this film adults are represented poorly, understated and almost ridiculed by their actions and decisions while teenagers are portrayed strongly and with well defined personalities. This would naturally delight anyone who's under 21. Also and despite differences of race, appearance, sexual orientation, etc, they're all accepted by their peers when it's well known that bullyism and gangs are common problems in real schools. There are scenes that appear to be only an updated version of 80's style coming of age movies and perhaps the inclusion of lesbian characters in the stereotypical motley crew of students is the novelty here. All in all, ""Booksmart"" provides a distraction from reality and a laugh, nothing more should be expected.",Booksmart

This film isn't funny, doesn't make you care about any of the characters or the situations they find themselves in and you really don't care about how it all works out in the end for them. The reason for this is that it doesn't resemble any real experience you would have had in high school or any of the people you would have ever have encountered there.It's all so fake trying so hard to be relevant or quirky that it loses any authentic or honest moments, there's no real dilemma that pushes the plot along,there's no one there who poses any real problem for the characters, you know they'll all be OK in the end. I know this is just a film and is a heightened version of reality but there is not one single genuine moment that creates any empathy or connection to the characters or their situation, but even if it is completely unrealistic it could still have had some funny moments but it just doesn't. Even as a complete fantasy it doesn't work because you just don't care and it becomes tedious very quickly.

No other movie made me feel that way. in the end, the characters and the audience are to realise that nothing is made to last forever. And it's so sad to think that. But that's okay, because it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. And that journey had been wonderful.Most of the story takes place inside a day and in that day they told their friendship in the best way they could. From the first scene we see the main characters on screen, we'll believe that they've known each other for years. The rest of the movie is all about their growth and self reflection and that is all inside a single day. They made it so believable.The cast is fantastic in this movie.

All films of this genre have things you could criticize, and no filmmaker goes in thinking about winning Academy Awards in this category. It's just a funny coming of age movie, so make sure you like that before venturing out to see it. The chemistry between Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein works well, with both characters really open with each other about sexual matters. And both really care that the other succeeds in that area.

622,amyjensmith,A strong debut from Wilde,7,14 June 2019,"The acting in this film throughout is great, and it is the talent on screen that sells a lot of the humour. All of the students actually seem like high school students, even if they are exaggerated, which I am really pleased about. The highlights of this film for me though are Kaitlyn Dever, whose character goes through the most development, and Billie Lourd who is a complete scene stealer as Gigi. Whenever she appears on screen, you know you are witnessing something special.This film comes in at 105 minutes, and the pacing of it is spot on. Despite the film taking place in such a small amount of time, the film never dragged on and each scene moved on as quickly as it needed to. Whilst I did not care for every scene and some of the film felt like filler just to have some character development, it never felt too long or boring and this is down to the tight screenwriting behind the scenes.I did have my issues with the film though. In general, I did not like the humour that came about with the students. Whilst I understand the choice, the students all felt a bit too cliché and stereotypical for a film that feels so fresh and current. All the jokes about the musical kids to the stereotyping of the jocks and the nerds feels outdated and overdone at this point, and almost feels like the behaviours of people starting school, not leaving it.",Booksmart

I popped in to see it today as I had a few hours to spare, and came out with a smile that lasted all day.I thought this was a gem of a movie. Yes, I could see links/nods etc to the likes of predecessor generational films like Superbad and Pretty In Pink, but it never felt like a copy of anything.The strongest points were the lead actors and the look/style the director went for. It's not without its cliches, but I'd still say its probably my favourite film of the year so far.",Booksmart
624,kyleeavery,A movie that will define this generation,10,30 June 2019,"This movie defied all of my expectations.
It elicited genuine emotional reactions at so many points. I laughed so hard I cried, I covered my eyes involuntarily at the amazingly done awkward moments, and I felt the pain of the emotionally hard moments. This movie is a brilliantly done comedy from start to finish.
I have never seen a movie that captures female friendships as well as this movie does. Not only that, but I have also never seen a movie that so perfectly captures the beauty and awkwardness that comes with being a young lesbian. It takes this subject very rarely captured and normalizes it in a way I wish I could see in every movie.
The forward thinking tone of being accepting of each other no matter what our differences are, was refreshing. I wish I had had the privilege of attending a high school like this.
The acting by the main two actresses was so flawlessly done that it is easy to forget this wasn't just a film of two people's real lives.
I wondered if there would be a movie like Mean Girls or John Tucker Must Die that would be revisited for years to come by this new generation- and this is IT.
Despite the media that has plagued this movie, it is hilariously written and perfectly executed.
Must watch.",Booksmart
625,clexuan,Teen classic,9,10 July 2019,"I enjoyed this film a lot. I don't understand the poor ratings because I and a large portion of the theatre were in hysterics laughing. My theory on why this movie appears so divisive here is that some imbd reviewers either really related to the characters portrayed while others could not and/or viewed the diverse characters and cast as being SJW propaganda in disguise. I say disguise because the movie itself has no political message. It's a somewhat simple comedy about two high school students trying to compensate for studying too much in high school after finding out the cool kids also got into reputable colleges. The premise and style of humour is simple but the execution of the comedic timing, editing, cinematography, and soundtrack is exceptional. I didn't give the film 10 stars because some parts of the storyline were not realistic or believable but that is something which I could at the same time overlook because I was just looking forward to the next laugh. Billie Lourd's character Gigi is a standout in this film. Overall, a funny and very quotable film which I believe will make this a classic",Booksmart

633,joyliuq,"I am a high school senior, and I find the portrayal baffling",3,12 December 2019,"For a movie that was going for ""realistic,"" Booksmart fell short. Really funny movie, but completely unrelatable.
1. Okay, I understand it's senior's last day, but where are all the other graders?! That's 3/4 of the school. During the ""school day"" part of the movie, all of the students were acting like maniacs, but the 9th/10th/11th graders should still be having class normally and also stressing about finals.
2. Speaking of finals, for many schools, the seniors' last week is finals week.
3. **The movie is underplaying how hard it is to get into the Ivys. It's not just about being ""booksmart"" nowadays, and having an entire school of T20 is nowhere near realistic. (Unless they're all rich/legacies/both.)
4. Harvard is one of the students' 5th choice? And she feels ashamed because of it? If she expressed that at an actual high school, people would flame her to death because that's just flexing and making others feel bad.
5. One of the kids got a job straight out of high school to code for Google for 6 digits. Caricature.
6. The lead characters are only friends with each other. Even though they only know the other people from class, I just find it unrealistic that they don't become friends with anyone else. Surely, they don't share every single class together. Surely, if one party can make them friends with other people, there's got to be ""fun"" moments in class where you bond. Literally, the ""us"" vs ""them"" mentality is too extreme.
7. Risking prison to bail people at a party? That's going to stay on your permanent record, and schools like Columbia are for sure going to rescind your acceptance. I can't imagine the lead (I forgot her name and it's only been half an hour) risking not going to college for kids she just met at a party.
8. Faking college ids to get into libraries?! Who even does that? Everything's on the internet. rEaL nErDs borrow their (ex-senior) college friends' accounts to get into NCBI research papers, scavenge across shady websites for private(ish) data, and maybe, just maybe, sneak into private rooms at the local library. Faking ids is unnecessary because, most of the time, nobody checks so it'll be overkill.
9. The two ""truly rich"" kids. No further explanation needed.
10. Do you know how much work it actually takes to be on top of school? I don't mean how much time spent. I'm talking about time, mentality, and grit (Doing homework is draining. Unless you like homework, in which you would be a weirdo.) Also, to get into good colleges, like I said in #3, you also need extracurriculars that you love doing. While you love them, your extracurriculars will also take a lot of planning and a lot of work. I just can't see someone balancing grades, extracurriculars, and still be the type of person that fools around in the hallways, deals drugs/alcohol, does not take their student council duties seriously, or drives around to give random people lifts and ""special services.""",Booksmart

640,larocqueella,A Funny Way to Show the Importance of Balance and Staying True to Yourself,7,26 January 2021,"""Booksmart"" directed by Olivia Wilde, starring Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein is a funny coming of age story that we did not know we needed. This successful movie was exciting and refreshing. Set and costume design made it feel like you were right back in high school.
On the last day of high school Molly (Feldstein) and her best friend Amy (Dever), who will be attending Yale University and Columbia University respectively, discover that their peers were accepted to top schools as well. Having perceived their peers as partiers, all play, and no work, they are disappointed to discover that their efforts did not get them any further ahead. On the night before graduation Molly and Amy plan to party to live it up like their peers.
The performances of Feldstein and Dever were stellar. They perfectly portrayed two academically focused high school students that want to break free. Together they bring excitement and fun to the story, yet their experiences and tribulations provide insight into the complex lives of teenagers. Their characters are often contrasted against Gigi (Billie Lourd) and Jared (Skylar Gisondo). Gigi is a free spirit and Jared is a rich student constantly looking for approval. Gigi randomly exists scenes in the film and awkwardly reappears in time sequences that do not make sense. Jared is an annoying character who viewers cannot seem to connect with. He monopolizes too much screen time, a poor choice from Wilde.
""Booksmart"" has great music that keeps the atmosphere light and viewers upbeat, excited to see what is to come. The sound effects are realistic, nostalgic, and familiar, having the ability to bring any viewer back to their high school days. The sounds of a skateboard in the hallway and the slam of a locker are just a few examples. The editing is superb, and the tracking is strong given there are many fast-paced scenes. ""Booksmart"" is an enjoyable movie, that shows viewers it is important to balance both work and fun.",Booksmart

You know, like real life?This isn't the grosses, loudest, coolest or offensive teens partying movie, but the depth of character, the overall message and the friendship portrayed felt real to me.

Wonderful coming of age movie.,10,30 June 2019,"After watching Booksmart, I thought it would be a great idea to read the reviews on imdb, only to find out that quite literally everyone thought the exact opposite of this movie as I did. i love coming of age movies because they are always so relatable since we are always evolving, and coming of age is not a one time event. Take Rushmore, for example. It's not a movie you have to google afterwards because you didn't get it, it's a movie that makes you feel hopeful, thankful and just plain jolly, and makes you genuinely care about the characters (same goes for this film).Booksmart may be a little rough around the edges and has a couple of things that didn't quite pan out (NOT A SPOILER: when Amy and Molly are fighting at that party and everyone is recording with their phones, but where the heck do those videos go?) but it doesn't mean it's not worth watching. It honestly made me feel as if I could do anything and made me value my friendships, as if I could do anything BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS MEANT TO DO, GIVE YOU HOPE. I get it, it's not an arthouse film blah blah blah, but, well, neither is fricking Avengers and you all still seem to enjoy it. Don't be so cynical and try to relate, and you might actually like this film as much as I did.And also, yes, I agree that some actors are a little too old to play high school kids but Billie Lourd did a fantastic job as usual, and Beanie is PERFECT for this part although she is 26.

This movie is one of the best things 2019 could provide for us.
No, it isn't an unforgettable masterpiece of all times, but it's simple, intelligent, sympathetic and even touching.
It's not that kind of movie you laugh from the start to the end. It's just that it has a light touch, without that heavy melodramatic atmosphere people would expect if the producers had chosen to call it a drama.
Maybe people that didn't get it used to be bullies at high school?
I myself was more like those two girls: never one of the cool kids. Could that be the reason some people could tell what the girls felt?
That bathroom scene where Molly confronted those three guys about their future was a slap in the face. It's sad but true. We (nerds) spent all the time believing that all the sacrifice of studying and abdicating the parties and all would at least bring some sort of ""justice"" in the end, but it doesn't! People can be bully and smart at the same time!
Maybe there's no place for a 100% nerd. Balance is required and, if we ignore it, time will take it's toll (like what happened to their teacher who tried for years to compensate what she didn't enjoy in the past).

I was looking forward to the release, because the previews looked really funny. But the actual movie I found very difficult to connect with, or empathize with the main characters. The plot that took the viewer from one non-sensical party to the next, seemed like just an obvious ploy to highlight certain colorful, weird or social reaching characters without a thread to hold it all together. Parts of the doll vignette were pretty funny... but that was about it, I'm sorry to say.Also, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my pet peeve with some of the modern ""girl-power"" movies or shows, of which this is one. That is the hyperbolic sycophantic mutual complements the leads lay on each other that reach a ridiculous level. STOP! That's not girl empowerment. Being real with each other is empowerment. Supporting each other is empowerment. Not back-biting each other is empowerment. Blowing hot air up each others skirt is NOT empowerment.

In a world where there are so many rubbish modern comedies being churned out I think Booksmart is a beacon of light, if only a small one. It's fun, quirky enough and colourful. The moral is super obvious and simple but it's worthy of fleshing out and reiterating, which in the end makes it a movie to watch. Give it a go!",Booksmart

682,annieYke,"Funny, clever, quotable",9,4 May 2019,"I saw Booksmart more than a week ago and I still chuckle at its jokes whenever I remember them. During the showing, it kept me laughing for multiple minutes straight many times. I wasn't keeping count, but I did walk away from the movie feeling physically taxed from all the laughter, in a good way. The humor is a mix of smart kids doing dumb stuff, ""dumb"" kids doing dumb stuff, kids in general saying surprising insightful stuff, and characters reminding the audience of what it means to be human and how fun it is.
Booksmart is script-heavy, which means listening to the movie and understanding the jokes is a major part of the viewing experience. This makes sense for a movie about two cerebral teens, and understanding how nerds banter makes the movie even funnier. Having been a teenage girl also helps, as Booksmart centers around the friendship of its two protagonists.
This movie transported me back to a younger self from four years ago, but it also reminded me of the present and how to cherish the current people in my life. I left the theater happy and hopeful.",Booksmart

The seeming hodge podge cast, actually comes together perfectly.The humor consistent, energy is high, and the characters are lovable. Skyler really delivers as secondary in this cast. Many may know him from the Santa clarity diet and he doesn't disappoint.Probably not something you want to take young kids to. Teens in high school will relate and love the level of humor. As a parent I wouldn't mind my kids seeing this if only to give
Them perspective on life after high school.",Booksmart

696,colts_obsession,So much potential...,2,2 June 2019,"So much talent was available to make this movie good but it fell super flat with me. I've never walked out of a movie but seriously considered it about 5-10 minutes in. I thought once they got to the ""party"" it would pick up but it stayed dry and awkward. The good ratings had me excited but I was ultimately very disappointed.",Booksmart
697,dikkexilly,"In our time we had ""Super Bad"" Let these kids have there ""Booksmart"".",8,1 December 2019,"Ok so after watching it and reading a lot of reviews, I can see why everybody is so divided on this movie.First of all; it's not a very original idea and it is indeed hard not to make the ""Super Bad"" comparison. But at the same time, it is a genre movie and I think we can all establish that ""Non-popular kids that want to go to a party but run into various obstacles along the way that interfere with them going to the party"" is a pretty strong genre on itself nowadays.Also, this is Olivia Wilde's directorial debut and obviously it shows throughout the movie. The script is far from perfect and because of that, some sections in the movie felt a bit too long and/or unnecessary. But then again, directing is an art and you don't master it when you are making your first film.People also said that they found it disappointing that the movie was shot in such a commercial way, meaning they would rather see the movie be more like ""Lady Bird"" or ""Dazed and Confused"". And while I get why people would like that (it would certainly be interesting to see how Olivia would approach that kind of movie). I also really like the fact that she didn't choose that route and gave it a more commercial feel. Cause this way she could spread the message to a bigger audience as well as paying kind of a homage to this type of genre movie's that also has a more commercial feel.And talking about the message in this movie. Here's where I think it really shines and why it was also a highly enjoyable movie. I found that the characters were all really refreshing. Everybody had their own thing going on so off course nobody liked each other but I didn't get the feeling that anybody in the movie was really bullied.
Even in the bathroom scene, where Molly is on the toilet overhearing a conversation about herself, the two guys also said some negative things about her because of her some personal traits she possesses but they also said a lot of positive things and it didn't feel like they said all those things just to be bullies.The main philosophy of this movie I also find very interesting. So these two girls behaved themselves all through high school so they could get into the best colleges only to find out that everybody who they though only partied all year and were interested in anything but school, also got into those colleges. Now, this may not look like a big massage but how many people from high school don't we know that live there lives exactly like that, basically missing out on all these great life experiences. For them, this is a pretty big message I take. And in this day and age, where most of our social contact moments are on a phone screen, a welcome one.Now can I also say that it was very refreshing to see a movie that featured the lgbtq+ so casually (like it is in real life I might at). Lots of characters were gay or floating in between, and it was just there. For me, the way it was portraited felt very much like my surroundings. It wasn't a big deal. It wasn't a search for answers about the character's sexuality like how a lot of movies would approach it when integrating this subject. And if you're a white male (like myself) and you're thinking to yourself right now ""why does everything have to be about lgbtq+ nowadays?"". Its because we have already seen all the movies about the white male protagonist from every angle and philosophy imaginable and frankly we all grew a little bit tired of it, That's why!And there are smaller clever things in ""Booksmart"", like the big fight scene with was very well shot. Also, wacky scenery moments that pulled the viewer out of reality for a second added a kind of surrealistic aspect to the movie.So all things considered: I really enjoyed this movie! Was it a masterpiece for cinema, no I don't think so. Does that matter? Not at all. Cause you can tell that this movie did what Olivia was set out to do; Make a fun movie to inspire highschool students and implement some fresh and interesting ideas to a genre we all grew up with and love. In our time we had ""Super Bad"" Let these kids have there ""Booksmart"".",Booksmart

They're not even playing with solo cups and they're sitting?!!? Not to mention that it looks like they're using multiple different kinds of cups.

And all that feminist propaganda was unbearable at times. Like seriously, the two main protagonists have a code word ""Malàla"" when they want the other one to do something with them without asking? Wtf?! Why movie, why.Yes, there was some good stuff. It did realistically portray high school, although most of the actors were per usual too old to play high schoolers, but I guess it's really hard to find actual teenagers to play teenagers, well. For example Billie Lourde, who's performance was the best part of the movie, is 27 and looks 27, the movie just loses credibility with that. And Beanie Feldstein was just so damn annoying, I guess that was the purpose of her character so kudos for the good acting, but she was just way too unlikable, at least for me.Overall, it wasn't an entirely bad movie, above all, it did have a good positive message in its core, I can't deny that, but it certainly doesn't deserve all the praise.",Booksmart

It completely took me back to that age when I had very intense friendships with other girls, and we sometimes got too wrapped up in each other, along with the fear that growing up and moving away meant losing something special.It was also good to see a high school movie where there aren't any Machiavellian villains, just kids who are all basically nice and trying to get along and I also loved the character Gigi - instantly iconic.

This movies has the same loose structure of Superbad but that's about where the comparison ends.This movie however is very good coming of age story carried by a ton of amazing performances.

Essence of Superbad, yes...thankfully, less raunchy...but equally clever writing, casting, and laughs. Of course, it had its share unrealistic HS scenarios (that car would never make that far up a walk way, let alone past our 700lb protective planters) but in our adolescent minds we rocked it it just like all of the personalities in this movie.Give a shot with an open mind.

724,dincuadriana,A teen girl's opinion,9,6 September 2019,"I've seen a lot of people comparing this movie to ""Superbad"", heard of it never seen it, and talking about how it wasn't funny. Well as an 18yo girl who just graduated highschool and will hop on a plane to college in exactly 5 days I disagree and it might be because the people giving it bad reviews might not be the target demographic?I found a lot of what happened in the film quite relatebale. Even as someone who actually partied in highschool their search for Nick's party was relateable esp because as a highschooler you're always looking for the next big chance to go crazy. Another thing I identified with was the way they reacted to the knowledge that they'll be apart for some time, even if I'm not that dependant on my best friend we did cry togheter today over going to colleges in different countries. Even the way they complimented each other, albeit exagerrated for comedic value is similar to the way me and my friends gas each other up before a night out.Anyway I actually liked this movie and I won't lie I was apprehensive going in because I honestly thought I'd dislike it for numerous reasons that proved to be untrue. I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I do hope you will try and enjoy this movie as it's very hard to like something you set out to hate.Sorry for any grammatical errors that might have snuck in, english isn't my first language.",Booksmart

But the best situation was spoiled in trailer.I felt a little adventurous vibe of the movie. Some situations made me smile, but generally it was teenage cliche movie. It is like soup opera of it's kind.Remind me childish movies, but with some lightly spicy scenes so children can not watch it. What I personally did not like is how this movie generalizes young people with they opinions and worldview. I think people in ages of the students which are in prom year, won't be so much surprised by the movie and the plot.Also was disgused of the political correctness which they were suggesting by every aspect of the movie, you couldn't even dodge, it was part of the plot, of the scenes, I was like, is it not an irony?",Booksmart

In this case I liked the movie enough, and didn't see the opinion that I had really represented much in the other plentiful reviews that seem to have a...theme? Anyway.I haven't laughed out loud at a movie like this in a long time. As an awkward nerdy woman who was once an awkward nerdy teenage girl in high school, I don't think I've ever seen a ""high school movie"" that felt so much like my experiences before even if those experiences happened decades ago. Sure, I never had these exact things happen, that would be wild. But in general, the sense of falling into the self-imposed pigeonholes of social roles when everyone around you is just another regular kid with a lot more in common than you really have that separates you is really well explored here, and I can't think of another movie off the top of my head that I've seen that really nails this theme like this movie does. It seems like it's such an easy trope for movies to fall into, pitting the nerds against the popular kids, the geeks against the jocks, authority figures like parents and teachers against the kids that they hold back.But I've never seen it put so simply as it was in this movie that people can put themselves in those roles and fall into tribal or self-defeating mindsets when really...we're all just people, just getting by as best we can? Maybe the jock gets down with Hufflepuffs. Maybe the girl that is really good at that one thing that the guys go after her for is also super, super smart. Maybe the girl who seems like she's just using that guy for his call is actually a ride-or-die loyal friend. Your teacher probably has a side-hustle, and maybe they wish they had more fun too. Your parents are probably huge doofuses, but they just want you to be happy. And maybe the kids who are pushing themselves to excel at the cost of having a social life could afford to chill out a little.Granted, just the message and the truth of the theme alone wouldn't have made the movie as good as it is, top notch sharp writing, acting, and hilarious characters is what did that. It's just so rare that I see a movie about teens in high school that actually makes me feel better about people, all people, where no one is really the 'villain' or oppressive and awful, where reversals of social roles don't have to have winners and losers. Can this get to be a thing? Can we have a hundred movies like this instead of revenge fantasies for people who imagine themselves to be wrongfully oppressed nerds? I'm eagerly looking forward to what basically everyone who was involved in this movie have in store next.",Booksmart

The sound track.. INCREDIBLE, I'll be downloading it tomorrow.
The acting.. IMPECCABLE, I'm an actor and the acting in this movie is so on point, so real, the Director must have really been allowing them to relax for it to look so natural. I followed every characters journey.
The comedy.. SO FUNNY, I rarely burst out laughing when watching movies but I kept bursting out laughing with this. And that's because the laughs were REAL, they weren't silly gags, not one.
The story.. AMAZING the story line was so nostalgic and took me back to my youth, my days at school..
The cinematography.. SO GOOD. This films reminds me of the shoot style of Euphoria, you dont even notice it unless your'e taking special note of the camera angles, the difference in tone of sound and... that Barbie animation sequence, OMG too good, I was in stitches..

People are comparing it to Superbad but why should these 2 movies be even mentioned in the same sentence? Yes theyboth have similar themes but it is disrespectful to cinema to compare every high school movie to a cult classic. Even though this movie doesn't rise above Superbad, doesn't mean this movie is super bad (pun intended). Olivia Wilde did an amazing job at portraying the modern youth with obviously some exaggerations. She created a setting where the 'minorities' didn't feel forced and the relationships between humans were natural. Wilde took an old and frequently used concept but gave it her own and modern touch.

740,jba-07289,It's pretty good...,8,20 November 2019,"Ignore all the bad reviews about this movie. Sure, it's a typical teen comedy. Couple of high school outcasts trying to have one last blast before graduation. We've seen this a million times. But it's actually pretty funny. There's nothing wrong with telling this familiar story from a contemporary perspective. Have a couple beers and watch it. It's free on Hulu,",Booksmart
741,slb-59280,Unrealistic and all over the place,4,8 July 2019,"Plot felt disjointed. The supporting characters were very caricature-esque and way over-acted to the point of it being distracting. Especially the Gigi character. For me the doll drug trip was just dumb and felt out of place. Overall, not as funny as I'd hoped for. The premise has promise but it wasn't executed well because the plot was all over the place. I did. Like some of the camera work and it was quite bright and beautiful aesthetically speaking. I would like to see what Olivia Wilde could do with a plot that was more fluid",Booksmart

745,letthemusicmoveyou,"A High School Movie that gets it right, but is not for everyone.",9,2 May 2019,"I saw this movie last night at an advanced screening and absolutely adored it. Great directorial debut for Olivia Wilde which captured perfectly the relationships and struggles of modern day teenagers. The chemistry between the two leads was superb because it felt natural and genuine which was very refreshing to see on screen.
In regards to flaws, there were sometimes that the comedy fell flat and was forced. This movie is definitely not for everyone due to the fact that it is very much a period piece dedicated to today's generation of youth, which will probably not hold up in the next couple of years. However, I say it has the great potential to be a cult classic.",Booksmart
746,christiancollins-60086,Not Funny,1,22 August 2019,There was nothing redeeming about this movie. It was an hour and forty-two minutes of wasted time.,Booksmart
747,andrearose-80694,Not for me,6,6 February 2020,"I'm not the biggest fan of coming of age movies as I dislike the intended awkward teenage interactions but Booksmart didn't have too many of those for which I was pleasantly suprised.I didn't, however, like or relate to the main character at all which tarnished the whole movie and all interactions with her in it. Understandable her negative personality traits where part of the coming of age but I didn't feel she really grew either. Just apologised and then carried on. The rest of the characters where likeable but felt a bit one dimensional. They called Molly out for her negative behaviour early on in the movie but still were really kind and welcoming at the end?! No one thought it was weird they did a 360 on their behaviour?But all that said it was a relatively fun watch.",Booksmart
748,hughe-25394,Wow-ed by advanced screening (hilarious and beautiful),10,25 April 2019,"This is not another teen movie. Very smart writing that reflects how teenaged people actually talk, act and break stereotypes. Every character is endearing and fun to get to know - so well-developed that you want to follow each of them off to college, not just the protagonists. The main characters share a deep friendship that felt very familiar to myself and fellow movie-goers and was full of the off-best silliness bestfriendness (akin to Superbad but with more complex character development). As a filmmaker, film scholar and culture writer, this film felt like breathing (when I wasn't choking on my laughter). Olivia Wild is a talented director and you can feel the influence of her previous experience directing music videos and short films. Beautifully hilarious. I laughed during 80% of the film. But, also engaging to watch. There are some fun editing, creative uses of camera angle and film tricks to get more laughs and tears. The panda. The pool scene. The awesome use soundtrack. You gotta see this film. Will be buying and teaching this film in my classes for sure.",Booksmart
749,kamaom,Couldn't finish it,2,14 December 2019,"Like others have said, this movie didn't live up to the hype. I read all the rave reviews from people I whose opinion I've respected and waited for this to come to a streaming platform. Now I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I didn't find any of the characters likeable or find any reason to want to know them better. I quickly found that I didn't care if the girls made it to the party. Maybe because it's so much like Superbad that I couldn't get invested in this, but it's nowhere near as funny or touching as that film, or Easy A (as teen coming of age films go)",Booksmart
750,blair-m,Juvenile Capers,1,31 May 2019,"What a torrent of unlovely language. We have heard it all before and get incredibly bored with the repetition. Not one laugh. A horrible thought, is this the way U.S. teenagers normally converse. As film buffs we normally wait until the end of a film. Here for the first time we left early

751,kenmooney-67618,Wish I could rate a negative...,1,30 June 2019,"This movie is bad. Was hoping to see ""American Pie"" or ""Road Trip"" type of funny but instead wasted nearly 2 hours of my life that I can't get back. Don't waste your time too!",Booksmart
