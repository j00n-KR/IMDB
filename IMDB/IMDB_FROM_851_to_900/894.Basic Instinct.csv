0,bkoganbing,Murder All Around Her,8,9 February 2013,"Although most reviewers have concentrated on the leads, Basic Instinct has some other fine performances in it. Still Michael Douglas as the sex obsessed cop and Sharon Stone as the amoral, multi-sexual woman who seems to have murder all around her give some iconic performances.A couple of SFPD detectives who played TV detectives, Michael Douglas in Streets Of San Francisco and George Dzundza in Law And Order, get assigned to the homicide of a former rockstar icon. The man had as the story tells us the 'coital moment of the century' before he died and as Michael Douglas finds out with Sharon Stone his prime suspect.It's not like Douglas hasn't any issues himself, he's seeing the SFPD shrink Jeanne Tripplehorn. One of those issues apparently is professional detachment as gets involved with both Tripplehorn and Stone. Far worse with Stone as she is a suspect.Murders in the past and murders in the present seem to pop up whenever Stone is around. She's an heiress to a fortune, a psychology major from college and licensed and an author of lurid novels. She knows how to press the buttons of both sexes and soon enough Douglas is in her world.The only one keeping a professional detachment is Dzundza who is not thinking with his male member. Even when an Internal Affairs cop who is investigating Douglas is murdered, Dzundza sticks by his partner. See what it gets him.In fact Dzundza and Tripplehorn don't get near enough credit for their work here. I think most know Tripplehorn as I do for playing Tom Cruise's wife in The Firm. She too is a woman with a lot of issues. As for George Dzundza as the only one in the film actually who seems to be normal, the others all seem to play off him.Still Sharon Stone's career was launched with what she did in Basic Instinct. This woman will wind up President of the USA or on death row, no middle ground for her. And you can believe she's every man and woman's coital moment of a lifetime.I don't know how successful or how good Basic Instinct 2 was, but seeing this has given me an incentive to see the sequel.",Basic Instinct
1,Leofwine_draca,Graphic Verhoeven showcase is one of the best of the psycho-thriller genre,9,16 October 2015,"For fans of Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi actioners such as ROBOCOP and TOTAL RECALL, this is the same but not the same. For instead of having explicit violence to carry things along, Verhoeven goes along with explicit sex for the thrills here (a formula he repeated later in his flop SHOWGIRLS before going back to the violence with STARSHIP TROOPERS). Of course with a film like this there was a big fuss when it was first released and it achieved a certain notoriety for the infamous leg-crossing scene. Sadly when most people mention this they tend to forget that aside from the sex there is also a pretty good thriller plot to enjoy.The makers of this film tried to give it a film-noir style, perhaps even going for a Hitchcockian influence. What they did do is succeed in making a powerful, intense whodunit which keeps you guessing as to the identity of the murderess right up until the end - and even then, a final twists means that it's all still ambiguous. As well as all the sex that's going on, Verhoeven still finds the opportunity to put in some of his trademark graphic violence in the shape of a pair of icepick murders which see blood flying everywhere in an extremely grisly fashion.Michael Douglas is well-suited for the role of the cop on the edge, with slicked-back hair to make him look younger. I know that his nudity in this film is a basis for a lot of people to make fun of him, but when I think of other male actors around at the time I can't really imagine anybody else in the role. While Douglas has the fairly straight and unexciting role, Sharon Stone on the other hand is a revelation: extruding an icy cold air and totally in control of herself and just about everybody else, her seductive siren instantly made Stone a star - and put her into the mainstream eye, away from the bit parts she had previously had in the likes of NICO: ABOVE THE LAW. It's safe to say that this film contains Stone's best performance and that she's never lived up to it since, except maybe in her believable portrayal of a drug addicted wife in Scorcese's CASINO.In support, George Dzundza is good as a comic relief cop while Jeanne Tripplehorn also gives an excellent performance as Douglas' psychiatrist. BASIC INSTINCT is well worth a watch, and not just because of the obvious reasons. Fans of thrillers should check it out.",Basic Instinct
2,SnoopyStyle,Unforgettable scenes in unimpressive story,6,24 November 2013,"SFPD detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) investigates a murder that leads to mysterious crime novel writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). She proves to be a manipulative woman. And Nick had some previous problems with IA. He was investigated by Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but is now having a sexual affair with her.There is no denying that the team of director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas has given the world iconic movie scenes. The interrogation scene will probably be around forever. And who can forget the ice pick. This movie has unforgettable moments.But the moments don't add up to a suspenseful drama. The pace is grindingly slow. They are trying to film a soft core porn movie and pass it off as a Hitchcock mystery. The constant innuendos and sexual perversions gets very exhausting. In the end, trying to follow the investigation is a waste of time. The movie deserves a 5 but I'll add another point for the scene. Any scene that gets so much parody deserves the point.",Basic Instinct
3,claudio_carvalho,Still Magnificent After Almost Thirty Years,8,16 December 2020,"In Los Angeles, the retired rock star Johnny Boz (Bill Cable) is stabbed by an ice pick and murdered tied to his bed during an intercourse. Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and his partner Gus Moran (George Dzundza) are assigned to the case. They head to the beach house of the psychologist and writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), who was Boz's girlfriend, to interview her. They find a cynical and intelligent woman and soon Nick suspects her of the crime. Det. Curran has recently killed two tourists in a shooting and his wife that committed suicide and is forced to visit the police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn), with whom he has a love affair. He continues his investigation and soon he has a sexual involvement with Tramell. He is sure that she is the killer when other evidences shifts him to another direction.Watching the erotic thriller ""Basic Instinct"" again after almost thirty years is still magnificent. The story has not aged, and it is great to see the cast younger and younger. Sharon Stone seems to be more beautiful and hotter than never in the role of the amoral Catherine Tramell. The Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is really an exciting experience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Instinto Selvagem"" (""Savage Instinct"")",Basic Instinct
4,kosmasp,Love or Sex?,9,28 July 2021,"Or is it murder? Well while the US (censors) do not mind violence too much - they are quite leniant when it comes to the degree that they allow - when it comes to sex and nudity ... well they are quite prude. Which when it happens, does backfire on the actresses - like it apparently did on Sharon Stone. She was marked one might say. And misstreated because people could not tell the difference between her and the character she played.On the other hand no one forced her to play the role ... a second time. And while I can't judge the sequel (would have to watch it first), I think it's safe to say that it was not nearly as good as the first one. The shock factor was gone too - well shock for the Americans that is. Who only got an R-rated cut anyway.But whatever version you watched (and I would say go for the uncut one), it is the pulp story that works its wonders. The mystery ... even if at the end you say, I knew it all along. But did you? Or rather do you? Is it that conclusive? Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.One thing that I could tell, even before I listend to the audio commentary and watched a few behind the scenes interviews, was the fact that the first time we see Sharon Stones character talk (to detectives), she seemed out of it ... like she was not the confident character the lines where suggesting. It felt like she didn't feel the role ... that struggle gave her performance something though - maybe something good or something bad, depending on how you feel about it. Especially now that I mention it and the stories tell us, what I felt: she wasn't in her role ... she didn't feel the character yet. Verhoven helped her though and everything went smoothly after that.Well almost everything ... because there is that one scene ... I mean there are a lot of scenes (the forceful sex which some can't stomache because of the borderline rape inclinations it brings up, to name just one other), but the leg crossing interrogation scene ... well, there is something to cherish (or not). Now Stone says she couldn't tell back then how that scene would look like on the big screen and what would be visible. I did not pause or freeze frame or even zoom - but it is obvious you can see something. And Verhoven being a European (Dutch) director, does not have issues with nudity (it is being said that he got naked on the Starship Troopers set, because some actors felt uncomfortable doing the shower scene) ... so the backlash might have been quite bad, but you can't really blame the director in this case too much.He handled everything in an open way and always talked about things. He even told every actor that auditioned about the amount of nudity - something that Douglas was not too fond of, him being the producer as well as the lead actor. And while his presence and some themes have been said to be sexist - the movie actually puts Sharons character on a pedastal. She triumphs over the men. She is in control most of the time (all the time?) ... while the men show a real ugly side.So while she may act out of lust and boredom - things that can or have been attributed to males - she is quite pure in what she wants. And she knows exactly how to get it too. So in a wicked way she is quite empowered ... so not really anything like Fatal Attraction ... not at all I'd say.A wicked movie, that might not see the light of production day ... today! Because everything has to be clean and non-offensive ... good thing we got this in and have something to talk about then, yes?",Basic Instinct
5,classicsoncall,"""You can put that in your book.""",8,11 May 2014,"If you're into steamy erotic thrillers and intriguing murder mysteries, look no further, but don't expect an ending short on ambiguity. Take it on faith that Catherine Trammell's (Sharon Stone) principal characters always end up dead, and Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) is a goner some time after the end credits roll. It's just that you don't get to see it.""Basic Instinct"" is high on adrenaline and a snort of cocaine or two, and Sharon Stone's interrogation scene will be talked about for years on end. It's the writing that keeps this thriller humming, and I can say for certain that I must have missed a nuance or two with the way the story developed, which means I'll have to catch it again at some point. The diversion with Jeanne Tripplehorn's character was an unexpected twist of sorts, and verges on being almost too coincidental to the other events going on, so it's not unusual to be left a little confused with the story's outcome. If it's all in the eye of the beholder, then this film has multiple interpretations and it's anyone's guess.But as a classic film fan, you know what really blew me away? That was Dorothy Malone in the lineup as the family serial killer Hazel Dobkins. I first saw her opposite Bogey in that hoot of an Acme Bookshop scene in ""The Big Sleep"". A quick check of her IMDb bio shows she's still kicking, although this was her last film appearance. She still looked pretty classy playing a murderess, and with a little ingenuity, she could have been made a pretty good suspect here as well. Why not drive Michael Douglas just a wee bit crazier?",Basic Instinct
6,gavin6942,Surprisingly Good,7,16 November 2015,"A police detective (Michael Douglas) is in charge of the investigation of a brutal murder, in which a beautiful and seductive woman could be involved.I thought this was going to be a 1990s thriller, nothing too special, sort of a companion to ""Fatal Attraction"". I mean, come on, both have Michael Douglas getting attracted to the wrong sort of woman, with plenty of sexual activity and his butt freely exposed to the world.But I actually think this was far more clever, almost even a satire of itself, if that is possible. The melodrama, the over-the-top nature, the fine line between thriller and horror with the nasty death scenes... this is a cut above the rest and may be something of a modern classic.",Basic Instinct
7,lee_eisenberg,Get ready.,10,12 March 2006,"""Basic Instinct"" is one movie that truly blows your mind. You've probably heard about the interrogation scene, but there's of course more to the movie than that. As Det. Nick Curran, Michael Douglas seems to be channeling his character in ""Fatal Attraction"" somewhat, and preparing for his role in ""The Game"" a few years later. But it's Sharon Stone, as author Catherine Tramell, who really makes the movie what it is. Along with the interrogation scene, she's like a combination of every femme fatale throughout movie history.But overall, I can't do this movie justice by trying to describe it. You have to see it to understand it. One of the reasons that it's so good is that you can never really tell who's on which side. As for all the sex (which probably takes up a quarter to a third of the movie)...well, that's part of what makes the movie so good. But I should remind you that this movie is very likely to completely blow you away. Also starring George Dzundza and Jeanne Tripplehorn.Considering that Paul Verhoeven directed ""Soldier of Orange"" in his native Netherlands, then directed ""Robocop"" and ""Basic Instinct"" here (and even ""Starship Troopers"" was OK), why did he degenerate into ""Hollow Man""?",Basic Instinct
8,jboothmillard,Basic Instinct,6,8 July 2005,"I have seen many adult thrillers that both get your heart beating, and you get to see a lot of bits that you want, but this is one of the best ones I've seen. Not just for the sex and nudity, but it has a really good story, from director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, RoboCop). A man is brutally murdered and Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) from FBI homicide is assigned to investigate. They question the man's ex-lover Catherine Tramell (Golden Globe nominated Sharon Stone), and ""coincedently"" she writes murder stories. Either someone was inspired, or the writer did it! Unfortunately, Douglas obviously falls for the suspect, bad move! The most memorable part is obviously Stone uncrossing her legs in front of Wayne Knight and Douglas, I know what I saw, and after saying one of my favourite lines, ""Have you ever f***ed on cocaine, Nick?"". It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe Best Original Score. Michael Douglas was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Sharon Stone was number 60 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Good!",Basic Instinct
9,ccthemovieman-1,"However You Label It, It Does Get Your Attention!",8,13 January 2007,"I've heard this movie labeled ""soft porn"" and perhaps that's correct. There are a number of sexy scenes in here including one famous one with Sharon Stone giving a glimpse of anatomy that usually isn't seen on mainline movies. The general question of the story is regarding Stone's character ""Catherine Trammell."" Is ""guity of a crime or not guilty? As viewers, we have to guess, and they don't make it easy.Along with the sex, you get a healthy dose of profanity and gore, too. Needless to say, this is a pretty intense and gritty film. (Many call it sleazy.) To its credit, it's a movie not easily forgotten. Michael Douglas co-stars as ""Det. Nick Curran."" In his prime film years, Douglas played in a lot of movies like this, with a lot of sexual stuff and intrigue.Every character in here is a rough-edged one, which is typical of a Paul Verhoeven-directed film. It may be his best movie (but I don't think much of him).It was interesting to see Dorthy Malone once again, even if it was just a cameo appearance. The 1950s movie star still looked pretty good to me!",Basic Instinct
10,Tweekums,A sleazy but enjoyable erotic noir,8,13 July 2017,"As this erotic thriller opens a blonde woman is seen having sex with a man; she ties his wrists to the bed then his pleasure turns to terror as she repeatedly stabs him with an ice-pick. Detective Nick Curran is in charge of the investigation and his only real suspect is the victim's girlfriend. She is Catherine Tramell, a bisexual crime writer whose latest book includes a murder that is identical to the one Nick is investigating. He is convinced that she is the killer but there is no actual proof and she is soon playing mind games with him. It turns out that many people who were close to her have died violently and she seems to be attracted to killers. This might include Nick as he had previously been investigated after the accidental fatal shooting of two tourists. As the story progresses Nick gets caught up in a relationship with Catherine; he is already in a relationship with the police psychiatrist who just happened to have known Tramell when they were both studying at Berkley. Nick later gets suspended from the case when an Internal Affairs officer is murdered shortly after confronting him.There is no denying that this film is best known for one scene where Sharon Stone shows that she isn't wearing any knickers; this is a pity as the film is far more than that one 'blink and you miss it' scene. The story is enjoyably sleazy with plenty of twists and turns. As the story progresses the suspicion moves between three possible suspects. We are constantly wondering whether Tramell is an intelligent killer who is playing games with everybody around her or whether somebody else is targeting people around her. Michael Douglas does an impressive job as Detective Curran but it is Sharon Stone who dominates the film as the seductive Catherine Tramell; a character who is almost playing with the audience as much as she is playing with the other characters. The supporting cast are solid as well; most notable George Dzundza as Nick's Partner and Jeanne Tripplehorn as the police psychiatrist. Nobody will be surprised that there is a fair amount of sex and nudity in this film, there are also some moments of intense violence that may disturb some viewers. Overall this is a solid thriller that should keep the viewer guessing till the very end and possibly one will still be wondering what really happened as the credits roll.",Basic Instinct
11,BA_Harrison,Classic Verhoeven outrageousness.,8,30 September 2012,"Despite being built around the most 'basic' of plots, erotic thriller Basic Instinct remains director Paul Verhoeven's biggest commercial success, being one of the highest grossing titles of 1992. Unperturbed by the protestations of gay activists and uptight censor-happy moralists, who objected to the film's provocative cocktail of graphic sex and violence and its portrayal of bisexuals as crazed killers, the general public flocked to the cinema to revel in Verhoeven's heady concoction of wanton lust and cold-blooded violence.Written by Joe Eszterhas of Flashdance fame, the script is slick Hollywood nonsense, a flashy, trashy, twisting, turning tale clearly inspired by Hitchcock and the film-noir genre. Frequently teetering on the brink of preposterousness, its is precisely the kind of far-fetched nonsense that only a true maverick like Verhoeven could do justice to—and boy, does he pull out all the stops here...Never one to do things by halves, the Dutch director opens his film as he means to go on, with a brutal murder that takes place during intercourse, a physically flawless blonde viciously stabbing her lover to death with an ice-pick. Scorching sex combined with gut churning nastiness, it's a real shocker (use the freeze-frame check out the outrageous shot of the pick going through the victim's nose!!!) and a clear indicator that this is to be no run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller.The remainder of the film follows troubled detective Nick Curran (Michae Douglas) as he investigates the murder, stupidly becoming involved with his prime suspect, scorching hot, super intelligent, highly manipulative crime novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), who may or may not be lining him up as her latest victim. Cue plenty more raunchy, near the knuckle nookie (including some rough rumpy-pumpy with the very sexy Jeanne 'gives me the' Tripplehorn), a few more gruesome deaths, a smidgen of exciting, pulse-pounding action, and the film's infamous blink-and-you'll miss-it shot of Stone's kebab as she uncrosses her legs during a police interview, all of which adds up to a whole heap of unmissable, jaw-dropping, eye-opening, big budget fun the likes of which we might never see again (unless Verhoeven can get Hollywood to forget all about Showgirls).",Basic Instinct
12,moonspinner55,"""What are you gonna do? Charge me with smoking?"" (charge her! charge her!)",5,4 June 2006,"Sharon Stone struggled in supporting roles in mostly unsatisfactory movies for years before she became an ""overnight sensation"" in director Paul Verhoeven's rather inelegant crime-drama. Contrived plot about a brazen, bisexual novelist who may have committed murder isn't particularly witty or clever or fresh, but it takes sexual matters head-on, and this managed to titillate a lot of viewers. Michael Douglas is the police detective who is drawn to Stone's writer despite or because of her scary straightforwardness, but we never get a sense of him as a character: is this hard-working guy (with an amazing amount of free time at his disposal) so benumbed by his profession that it takes a she-demon like Stone to turn him on? If so, wouldn't this affect his relationships with other women? (colleague Jeanne Tripplehorn seems not to notice). Stone's bisexuality is just window-dressing, as are the sex scenes themselves, mainly because the story itself isn't fully fleshed out (it resorts to the hoariest of clichés, like dragging out the protagonist's college graduation photos!). Verhoeven's direction is predictably wired but not especially tantalizing--the film plays like sub-Adrian Lyne--and the film's high budget doesn't account for the depressingly flat look of the picture, including pulpy-cartoon set-ups and lighting that seem to invite unwelcomed laughs. The whole film is a tacky titter. ** from ****",Basic Instinct
13,Quinoa1984,Sharon Stone gives something memorable,7,13 July 2000,"This is a film that had many boys in the early 90's (and probably still today) wondering during the film ""where is the hand lotion"".  But seriously, this film gets a big boost by it's incredible sexuality by it's two female leads (Jeanne Tripplehorn and Sharon Stone) who help the mystery and passion in this thriller about a ice picck killer and the cop trying to track him (or her) down.  Very suspensful, as Michael Douglas (who plays the cop) gives one of his best performances along with Sharon Stone's performance (not to mention something that will have everyone sweating even in 32 degree weather).  Paul Verhoven brings some great fun, especially in the director's cut which shows a lot more nudity and plot.  A",Basic Instinct
14,edwagreen,Basic Instinct: Go Back To Psychology 101 **1/2,4,2 July 2011,"The film begins to go down in quality as it becomes a psychological-thriller. This invariably leads to the guessing game phenomenon.Kudos has to go to Sharon Stone for his outrageously wonderful performance as a sex starved woman who you really can't make out. As devious and obnoxious as they come, she is a teaser in every sense of the word.Stone is equally matched by Michael Douglas, the frustrated cop, whose life becomes quite adversely affected when he gets to know Stone.Jean Tripplehorn stars as a psychologist with her own private agenda.As the bodies pile up, the film falls into a state of confusion.

And, it's easy to see why. Introducing herself by slipping into something more comfortable, Ms. Stone likes to smoke while heating up the police station by letting interrogating detectives see she doesn't wear panties. This scene is early, but short, so have one of your hands on the ""replay"" and ""pause"" buttons. ""Basis Instinct"" is about sadomasochistic sexual desires, so expect violence with your intercourse.While Stone is sexy, and keeps the movie going with her performance, the story itself is unsatisfying. It's best seen as a teen viewer's coming of age film. Mr. Douglas plays a recovering user of alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco. He seems to handle his vices well. At one point, Douglas gets hit by a car - twice - and shows absolutely no physical side effects. Douglas takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And, his hair looks great. Stone and the film's other women are super-bisexual, hot to trot, and like it rough. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Leilani Sarelle lend firm support.

During the investigation, Nick meets Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a crime novelist who was Boz's girlfriend when he died. Catherine proves to be a very clever and manipulative woman, and though Nick is more or less convinced that she murdered Boz, he is unable to find any evidence. Later, when Nilsen, Nick's rival in the police, is killed, Nick suspects of Catherine's involvement in it. He then starts to play a dangerous lust-filled mind game with Catherine to nail her, but as their relationship progresses, the body count rises and contradicting evidences force Nick to start questioning his own suspicions about Catherine's guilt.Basic Instinct had sex scenes were memorable.The K mart bought ice-pick would always be the most memorable object of the film.And interrogation scene will always be remembered as the sexiest moment of that decade.But overall,Basic Instinct is a story that toys with me with its story and screenplay of whodunit for it just gave me two possibilities that was fully supported in the entire film.All the moviegoer has to do with the story is to flip the die and go home satisfied.",Basic Instinct

19,hitchcockthelegend,I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.,7,12 December 2012,"Basic Instinct is directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhaz. It stars Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, George Dzundza, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Denis Arndt and Leilani Sarelle. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Jan de Bont. Nick Curran (Douglas) of the SFPD is strung out and under investigation by Internal Affairs, last thing he needs is to be drawn into a dangerous relationship with a sex crazed blonde who may be a murderess...Time hasn't been kind to Verhoeven's soft-core porn thriller, where once was shock and awe killings (the film opening with a brutal mini ice-pick murder), steamy love scenes and a famed and controversial crotch shot, now is ludicrous orgasms, iffy effects and Michael Douglas' unappetising ass! Hell there was even protests during the film's initial theatre run as the gay community went up in arms about the portrayal of bisexuals possibly being mad murderers?Yet for all of its taming over the years, Basic Instinct can at least now been seen as the hugely efficient mystery thriller that it is, one that is propelled by some very good performances by the principal actors. The strength in the story is not in the sex or blood, but in the character arcs of Nick Curran and Catherine Tramell (Stone). Curran is a man perched on the edge of doom who is controlled totally by the women around him. He is by definition a quintessential film noir protagonist, in so deep he ultimately will be resigned to his fate. Catharine Tramell is a ultimate femme fatale, beautiful and seductive, she's always in control, leading all male characters where she wants them to go. There's a delicious kink to the narrative, with Verhoeven gleefully pulling the strings, a smirk no doubt etched onto his face. This is very good story telling, with a plot of substantial twists and turns. True, it does carry some soft-core baggage that can steer the restless away from the character strengths within, but for the neo-noir crowd there is much to enjoy here. 7.5/10",Basic Instinct
20,Theo Robertson,Apart From The Sex Scenes What's The Fuss About ?,4,28 August 2005,"In 1992 BASIC INSTINCT was a media event in itself with right wingers and gay groups standing side by side picketing outside cinemas and mainstream critics gasping as to what Hollywood studios would depict next on screen . Ah you see you'd forgotten all about the controversy hadn't you ? Perhaps that's because the people who called this movie "" depraved "" or "" homophobic "" quickly woke up and smelled the coffee and realised they'd made fools of themselves while Paul Verhoeven , Joe Eszterhas and the studio bosses laughed all the way to the bank I suppose somewhere down the line BASIC INSTINCT was planned as a modern film noir but it's important to note that film noir is a sub genre that is darkly lit . Why then does Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont insist on using bright and garish colours throughout the movie ? Remember the neon lighting in TOTAL RECALL ? That's the exact same style we see here and you do have to wonder if anyone involved in this production had any inkling of the literal _expression of "" Film noir "" ? But lets not be too critical since this movie was hyped as containing "" the most explicit sex scenes ever seen in a Hollywood production and you can even see a front bottom if you look closely enough "" . You do get the feeling that some people need to get out more All in all a very average movie that without the controversy would have probably disappeared quickly from the box office and seems lame and cynical in the 21st century . You might be surprised to learn that there's a sequel planned for release next year which will no doubt be released straight to DVD",Basic Instinct
21,jotix100,"""Baring"" the truth",8,28 June 2005,"This 1992 film will go on record as being one that decided to present in a realistic way the sex one sees shown on the screen. After all, most studios, up to this point, would give the viewer a teasing account of what they perceived as a way to deal with the subject in a tamed way.Well, enter Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch director who decided not to leave anything to the viewer's imagination, making a graphic movie that is pure and unadulterated explicit sex account of the screen play by Joe Eszterhas. Mr. Eszterhas is a man with a vivid imagination who can write a story not shying away from all the gory and sexual details some others shun away from.The film keeps reminding us of other, more accomplished films, but what makes this movie work is the pure raw magnetism that Catherine Trammel, a mystery writer, shows at all times one sees her on screen. Ms. Trammel, is a suspect of the murder of her boyfriend, who is found dead. That brings the SFPD to investigate. Det. Nick Curran, who is a man that has killed in the line of duty, is being investigated by Internal Affairs. Curran is under the care of police psychiatrist, Dr. Beth Garner. Sex has a lot to do with what makes Nick Curran tick. He is a man who loves to have kinky sex, as we witness him doing on the screen. Nick falls for the enigmatic Catherine, who could be the killer he is hunting and who has killed two of his colleagues.The film works basically because we are sucked into the action by the allure of that gorgeous creature, Sharon Stone, whose performance in this film is the best thing going for it. Michael Douglas is equally good playing with intensity the role of the detective Curran.

22,preppy-3,Over the top erotic thriller,10,26 February 2005,"A man is viciously stabbed to death with an ice pick while having sex--by the way, that's the opening scene! Det. Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and his partner (George Dzundzu) get involved with the case and its prime suspect--Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). Then the story kicks into high gear with many twists and turns...One of the most talked about films of 1992. This movie REALLY pushed the R rating to its limits (a sex scene and killing were cut by a few seconds) and started controversy over supposedly being homophobic. I'll deal with that right away--I'm a openly gay man and proud of it. I found nothing homophobic about this film back in 1992 and I still don't. SPOILER!!!! Yes Stone's character is bisexual and she is a killer. Yes, her lesbian lover dies. But does anyone realize that Stone is the most likable character in the movie and that Douglas and Dzundzu are foul-mouthed jerks? Also Stones sexual inclination is never a specific plot point--she just happens to be bi--it's treated casually. And it's just a movie! I have many other gay friends who saw it and have no problem with it either. SPOILER END!!!!The plot is intricate with many turns you don't see coming--I had to see the film THREE times to figure it out completely. Here are a few random thoughts about this:It has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith. Starts right out with a sex murder wasting no time! There's absolutely stunning cinematography by Jan de Bont. Well-directed by Paul Verhoeven. I love Stone's look when she heard about the first murder. The constant references to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" were numerous-check out Stone's outfits. Dorothy Malone pops up in a small part. The interrogation scene with Stone is just superb--and look close when she crosses her legs! The sex sequence between Douglas and Stone is VERY explicit. Douglas should think twice about ever doing a nude scene again (there were giggles when I saw it in a theatre).Acting is great too. Douglas has played this part before and he's WAY too old but he pulls it off. He is very convincingly loosing it at the end when things start unraveling. Stone is just incredible as Tramell--sexy, frightening, just unbelievable. Her best performance so far. Jeanne Tripplehorn (in her first movie) lends strength in a strong supporting role. Not all of the cast likes this film. Stone has said it's a stupid film and Douglas still won't talk to Verhoeven or Stone and Tripplehorn won't talk about it at all. Also Joe Esztherhaus script is twisty but the dialogue is pretty laughable--it seems dumbed down so everybody will understand it.Still this is a sexy, violent, strong thriller--one of the best ever done. Try to see the unrated version. Avoid (at all costs) the TV version.",Basic Instinct
23,LeonLouisRicci,Unsatisfying,7,11 March 2013,"There is so much here that is unresolved that it leaves an empty, unfulfilled feeling that the viewer has been suckered. Endless nude and sex scenes intrude on the mystery plot and in the end it is all for not much.Infamous for its explicit exploitation of said sex and nudity and forever frustrating for that's pretty much all there is. The soft-porn aside it can be a somewhat sultry, trashy ride with enough intrigue to keep the interest but not enough to make it a totally engaging entertainment.The biggest problem is the ambiguity about most of what unfolds. There are dangling plot elements and shallow, confusing side shows. In all, it is a murky, muddy, and thin piece of Pulp that has modern machinations and push the envelope displays of Crime Fiction laced with so much pomp that it's rendered impotent.The Movie has enough sizzle to attract viewers but cannot justify all the indulgence and will most likely be an unsatisfactory guilty pleasure.

24,writers_reign,Crotch On The Rocks,6,3 May 2015,"Whenever a film achieves notoriety for a given scene/sequence as is the case here, and is, on the strength of the scene/sequence and word-of-mouth surrounding it which, more often than not, results in it becoming a hit, the question we need to ask is, how is the rest of the movie, i.e. if the scene in question were omitted would the film itself hold any interest; for example if the car chase sequences were removed from both Bullitt and The French Connection would the rest of those films have the same cachet. Basic Instinct is firmly in the niche of fast-paced thrillers with a large whodunit element like, for instance, Jagged Edge.

The suspense is nail-bite-inducing. We are treated to an incredible script full of twists and turns, and most viewers will be puddy in Verhoeven's capable hands. Yes, there are a few plot holes, but this really doesn't strain credulity that heavily, and it certainly delivers if you accept the minor oversights. The acting, other than Sarelle who is over the top here and there, is spot-on. Stone practically melts the screen. The way this, and the people in it, play games... you will *not* be bored. Characters are largely credible and well-developed. This keeps a fast pace. The editing and cinematography are rather effective, with the camera often being tight and close, in a sort of ""intimacy"". Dialog is well-written and delivered well, and can be quite funny, clever and sharp. There is a lot of graphic, nearly explicit sexuality(also in the lines) and nudity of both genders, a bit of moderate, bloody violence and disturbing content, and some strong language in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, particularly its director. 8/10",Basic Instinct
27,gridoon2021,Crcakerjack erotic thriller - still the best of its kind,7,26 April 2020,"""Basic Instinct"" is an example of Hollywood moviemaking where everything comes together and works in harmony with everything else. This ""everything"" includes: Paul Verhoeven's driving direction; Jerry Goldsmith's bombastic, Bernand Herrmannesque score; Jan De Bont's sleek cinematography; Frank Urioste's pulse-pounding editing; sweeping San Francisco vistas; tight pacing; edgy, sometimes hilarious dialogue (""he got off before he got off!""); a vigorous Michael Douglas; Sharon Stone's career-defining, iconic performance as a woman who challenges patriarchy, authority, law and morals; George Dzundza's enormously likable, blue-collar sidekick. You could argue that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas basically recycles the same formula he used in ""Jagged Edge"", just with the genders reversed, but this time he goes one step further: the investigating officer does not really care if the main suspect is guilty or not; in fact, the possibility that she might be a psychopathic murderess - and that his next orgasm could be his last - turns him on even more! For all the controversy the film caused, this is probably the kind of thriller that Hitchcock himself would be making if he were alive in the 1990s (he was already heading down that path with his 1972 ""Frenzy""). ""Basic Instinct"" is extremely well made and supremely entertaining. Skip the sequel. *** out of 4.",Basic Instinct

31,Mr-Fusion,"Naughty, sleazy and extremely silly",4,3 September 2014,"Up until maybe an hour in, BASIC INSTINCT isn't bad; kind of an average Michael Douglas police procedural with an icy blonde playing head games. It's as if this movie switches gears at the halfway mark into absurdly hammy psychological thriller mode. Just goes right over the cliff. I know these sex scenes were provocative twenty years ago, but now they're lost in the misogynist script and bad Michael Douglas performance. It's funny, the only person I cared about in the movie was George Dzundza. Douglas comes off as a cartoon most of the time and Stone is just sex appeal (to her credit, she plays that to the hilt). My problem with the whole thing is that I didn't care about most of these people, which is bad when the movie's constantly asking me to guess who's doing the killing. Aside from some great Rob Bottin effects, there's not much here. It's excessive, runs long and and is manipulative garbage right to the very last shot. 4/10",Basic Instinct

So that's three things I don't have in common with most people and to make matters worse (or better) it is probably the film I have watched more often than any other (Don't Look Now might give it a good run). And the crazy thing is, of course, that it is a thriller with lots of suspense and 'who did that?' moments all the time, so how can it be watched many times? The answer is, that this is so well done that you can't help getting caught wondering and double guessing or simply not caring and just enjoying the fabulous visual, the fantastic score (not the only echo of Vertigo (there's one more I watch fairly frequently - how strange) and Sharon Stone. Verhoeven does not shy away from sex scenes, actually he must love them to direct them with such care and attention to details. Clearly Stone shares some of that passion and together star and director produce some red hot stuff here. There are also scary car chase scenes, gory kills, moments of amusement, a real sense of mystery - hairs on the back of the neck style and just a sheer love of cinema oozing from those lush and carefully chosen set-ups. Love it.",Basic Instinct
33,JamesHitchcock,Black to play and mate in five,6,24 May 2011,"There are certain films which have become famous on account of one sexually provocative scene. ""From Here to Eternity"" is an excellent film, which deserves to be remembered for many things, but it lives on in the public imagination as the film where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr make love on the beach, even though that scene only occupies a short part of the film's running time. ""The Seven Year Itch"" is remembered mostly for Marilyn Monroe's skirt billowing around her legs. And the more recent ""Wild Things"" is best known for the kiss between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, although to be honest it has so few intrinsic merits that it deserves to be remembered for little else.""Basic Instinct"" is similarly best remembered for a single scene, although by the early nineties the definition of ""sexually provocative"" had changed somewhat since the fifties. In ""The Seven Year Itch"" it was sufficient for Marilyn to show a bit of leg; contrary to popular belief she never reveals her panties in the film itself. In 1992, however, a girl showing off her legs- or even her knickers- would have been far too tame to catch the public imagination, so Sharon Stone had to cross her legs to reveal- well, you'll have to watch the film to find out what she reveals.The film centres on the investigations into the brutal murder of rock star Johnny Boz, stabbed to death with an ice pick during sex. The main suspect is Catherine Tramell, Johnny's crime novelist lover. Suspicion falls upon Catherine because she just happens to have written a novel in which a rock star is stabbed to death with an ice pick, but she points out that she would have to be very stupid to murder someone using a method she had already described in one of her books and claims that someone is trying to frame her. The plot is far too complex to set out here, but it revolves around the three-way relationship between Catherine, Nick Curran (the police detective investigating the murder), and Dr. Beth Garner, a police psychologist who once had an affair with Nick and who may have had one with Catherine. (Both women are bisexual).Around this period Michael Douglas seemed to specialise in appearing in erotic thrillers; I used to wonder whether he had a clause in his contract guaranteeing him at least one sex scene with an attractive co-star in every film. See also ""Fatal Attraction"" (Glenn Close), ""Shining Through"" (Melanie Griffith) and ""Disclosure"" (Demi Moore). ""Basic Instinct"", however, is sexually explicit far and beyond even Douglas's normal standards, and several leading actresses, including Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan, refused the role of Catherine for this reason. Even Greta Scacchi, who throughout the eighties had rarely managed to keep her clothes on throughout a movie, turned it down.This opened the way for Sharon Stone to appear in the film which made her a star and launched her, at the surprisingly advanced age of 34, on her career as one of the leading sex symbols of the 1990s. In 1992 Stone was not particularly well-known, although she had taken the female lead in films like ""King Solomon's Mines"" and ""Total Recall"", but made the most of her opportunity. Camille Paglia called her performance ""one of the great performances by a woman in screen history"", although I suspect she was being deliberately provocative of those gay activists who had pilloried the film because of its alleged stereotyping of lesbian and bisexual women as twisted and evil. Certainly, few professional critics would have agreed with Paglia, although it must be said that Stone makes her character supremely seductive, reminiscent of the great femmes fatales of film noir. (Rita Hayworth in particular comes to mind). For all her glamorous good looks, however, it is difficult to understand just why Nick is so smitten with her, as it ought to be obvious to anyone that she is, as Lady Caroline Lamb said of Byron, ""mad, bad and dangerous to know"".Although the film made a star of Stone, it failed to do the same for Jeanne Tripplehorn, who plays Beth and whose subsequent career has been rather patchy. This is certainly not Douglas's best film, but he does at least manage to suggest something of Nick's troubled back-story, including accidentally shooting two people while high on cocaine, an incident which has understandably blighted his police career.The film as a whole is on one level a reasonably well-done thriller. Yet on a deeper level it fails to work for the reason that it lacks any human warmth. It works as an intellectual puzzle, the cinematic equivalent of those chess problems which ask us to work out how black can force checkmate in five moves. As a human drama it does not work at all because the characters are simply the component parts of that puzzle; they only exist because you cannot have a chess problem without chess pieces. 6/10",Basic Instinct

35,Red-Barracuda,Sex and violence mainstream Hollywood style,6,27 January 2010,"This erotic thriller caused quite a sensation back in the day, and it's not necessarily hard to see why. There is so much excess in this movie that it was pretty much impossible to ignore at the time. As a thriller it's barely average but it makes up for this with a surprisingly high sleaze factor for a big budget Hollywood product. In fact it could be said that this film's success and notoriety is based on Sharon Stone crossing her legs. Very rarely in cinema history has a movie's reputation been based on a two second sequence, although admittedly, it is a wickedly daring and audacious scene. Even to this day it is extremely rare for a top actress to so blatantly flash her under-carriage at the audience in a mainstream movie. In fairness, director Paul Verhoeven isn't exactly renowned for his restraint, and here he seems to be in his element using his subtle-as-a-brick approach to maximum effect. The film is bookended by a couple of extremely violent murders that would not look the least bit out of place in a slasher movie; and there are a number of explicit sex scenes throughout.Basic Instinct is almost a hybrid of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill. It has the protagonist's fatal obsession with a dangerous blonde of the former, combined with the extreme violence committed by a mysterious peroxide killer of the latter. Moreover, the San Francisco setting and Sharon Stone's outfits mirror Vertigo, while the steamy sex and brutal murder in a lift echo Dressed To Kill. In all honestly though, Verhoeven's film is not as good as either of these two movies; it lacks the depth and intrigue of Hitchcock's mystery or the sheer cinematic style of De Palma's sex and violence opus.In the final analysis it's really Stone's film. Her role as the ultimate femme fatale is one that she proves to be highly adept at playing. She is the undoubted focus of the movie and transcends the film's sometimes bad dialogue. Everyone else is OK but this is really a vehicle for its lead actress. In terms of plotting, the film is highly convoluted and never very realistic but this isn't something that seems to have been a priority and is a feature of this particular genre in any case. At the end of the day, if you want to see an example of a 90's Hollywood product that pushed the envelope in terms of explicit content then Basic Instinct is a good place to start.",Basic Instinct

Those erotic and sleaziness elements of the film, though, did wore me off, as it did made me uncomfortable at times. However, aside from the sexual materials in the film, the plot about the criminal investigation and the seductiveness of Trammell in trying to cloud Curran's mind and interfere with the investigation is quite intriguing. This all leads onto a tense game of cat and mouse that leaves the movie unpredictable until the every end. Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone gave off quite a fascinating performance.

37,sddavis63,Solid Murder Mystery With Good Acting,7,28 January 2002,"There are twists and turns galore in this erotic thriller starring Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas that keep the viewer off balance and not really sure who the criminal is right up to the very end.Douglas plays Nick Curran, a disgraced San Fransisco police detective who takes on the case of a man stabbed to death with an ice pick. Stone is Catharine Tramell, the chief suspect, a spoiled rich girl with a background in psychology who spends the movie toying with Curran's mind. There are good supporting performances from George Dzundza as Curran's partner Gus, and from Jean Tripplehorne as the police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner.This movie of course became famous because of some steamy sexual content. I watched the sanitized version this evening, with the sexual content (and even the bad language) removed. I wondered at first what this movie would be like without those scenes. But I discovered that this movie is built on much more than just controversy. It is a truly good murder mystery that keeps the viewer involved. It's truly fascinating to watch Curran's descent as he gets more enmeshed in the case (and more involved with Tramell) to the point where his life begins to parallel hers in many ways. Stone also shows a good range of acting skills, playing everything from the stone-cold (excuse the pun) manipulator to the emotionally fragile and vulnerable young girl in need of comfort.This is certainly worth taking the time to watch. I'd suggest renting it, because I still think the full version is better, but even the sanitized version is pretty good.7/10",Basic Instinct
38,thesar-2,Basically I think this is one of my all-time favorite (guilty pleasure) movies!,10,9 January 2010,"Ah, my favorite guilty pleasure of all time and the movie I've probably seen 40 times. I loved Basic Instinct for many reasons, but number one: Catherine Tramell (Stone.) Tramell is the prime suspect in the murder of a mayor-loving, retired rock 'n' roll star Boz after its realized she's not only his lover, but she wrote a book years back on exactly how he would die. Curran (Douglas) is not only suspicious of her, but deeply falls for her, even though Tramell tells him he's her new character to be bumped off in her forthcoming novel.The movie proceeds with the investigation that goes deep into Tramell's past as well as everyone else around her and Curran. Curran also runs deep into his involvement with his suspect. People are used, victimized and played as all part of Tramell's deadly game of whodunit and who-will-do-it.It's common knowledge this movie was ""controversial"" for its use of a lesbian killer and a (potential) murderer bisexual by the gay community. Please. Please stop. Really? This movie is worth protesting? Would it be alright if both mentioned characters were straight and then everything's alright and everyone picketing would go home? Isn't that like a thief in a movie that happens to be played by a black male, so the NAACP goes out in full force until that character's played by anyone other than black? I think this shows all humans – gay, straight, bi, black, Asian, white, whatever – are flawed. I pity and disavow any protest these homosexuals showed.As for Tramell, I loved everything about her and Stone's portrayal. Not a second did Stone get out of character, not a second passed where she wasn't in complete and utter control of herself, her surroundings or people near or far. She was rich, incredibly smart and bored with a simple life. Also, Tramell did have a degree in psychology, but I think it was her perfect instincts to read and manipulate people (guys and gals) to exactly how she wants the situation to unfold. In conclusion, I'm raving about a super-human and omnipotent character, or girl that just wants to have fun. (She would probably win the majority of poker games if she ever would be involved in what she would probably consider too slow of a game.) Other than Tramell that ranks high (if not #1) on my favorite movie-character list of all time, I'm always a fan of Douglas. Though not his best performance, he really moved the story along and had excellent chemistry between himself and Stone.In addition, I loved the mystery, the never-ending whodunit storyline – it's been told the real killer was revealed, but I don't care, I don't want to know. It's probably the fact that I don't want Tramell to be the killer since, in my mind, that would make her even smarter as she was able to organize this gigantic ruse without even picking up an ice pick. (Okay, she did at one time, but only aimed it at actual ice.) Also, Tripplehorn (in her fabulous theatrical debut) and Dzundza were perfect in their roles. And Sarelle pegged the psychotic, jealous and angry lesbian to the tee.I could go on and on further about the different aspects of Basic Instinct I loved the most. Okay, I will. I absolutely loved the fact that aside from some minor details – such as the computer, the movie is practically timeless which is always a product of good film-making. It's now 18 years later and it's as if the movie could've been released now. Also, the score (one of my all time favorites; I've probably listened to it 600+ times) is excellent as well as the soundtrack. I loved the music played, namely in the fantastic club scene – a scene I would be completely involved in immediately following the year's release.I can't forget the gorgeous scenery and cinematography. Never a moment passed where I didn't feel I was in San Francisco or the surround areas. And those views! Those houses! And the views from the houses! Positively breathtaking. I'm sure it's no coincidence that the movie is very Hitchcockian, and it's based in San Francisco where Hitchcock loved to film.And finally, I absolutely loved the script and dialogue from everyone, but one character (obviously) stands out in my mind. Not only do I love the dialogue from Tramell, but I can practically quote her every line.""I'm a writer; I use people for what I write. Let the world beware."" SEE THIS MOVIE.",Basic Instinct

40,ElMaruecan82,Basic Trash transcended by the film-making Instict ...,7,2 April 2014,"Basically, ""Basic Instinct"" didn't have a plot, but it had a purpose and it sure knew how to sell it.The way I see it, on the surface, ""Basic Instinct"" is like an elegant and sophisticated lady, you know with high heels, a large hat and a cigarette-holder à la Audrey Hepburn, but at the end, you realize that she's nothing but a whore, it's not even about sex, it's about money. Yet for some reason, you can't resist her charm and you're ready to pay the big price. We're part of the same hypocrisy but when our senses are aroused, it's hard to say 'no'.This is why I believe that the greatest trick ""Basic Instinct"" ever pulled was to rise above its content, which can objectively be described as basic trash, and make people believe it had a plot, something easily disguised under the soft and silky drapes of a half-glamorous half-Hitchcockian directing, that's the film-making instinct, its one-salvation merit. Paul Verhooven is not a director renowned for his subtlety, he knows why most people will buy the ticket, and why no less will inevitably buy or rent the VHS, but after all, if you're going to make trash, why not do it with some style? Speaking from my own experience, back in the 90's, I remember ""Basic Instinct"" was the cinematic incarnation of the forbidden fruit. I was about 15 or 16 when I lamentably avoided eye contact with the VHS vendor, but obviously she knew I hadn't the profile-type of the movie geek. I saw the film waiting for the infamous leg-crossing interrogatory, then for the first sex scene between Michael Douglas and the fittingly named Jeanne Tripplehorn and then my virginal senses culminated with the climactic sex scene needless to say that I couldn't care less about the plot; I cared for the purpose and its visually educational value, so to speak.And I guess my own experience works as a perfect defense against the allegiances of manipulative writing- manipulative here doesn't refer to the kind of plots that leads us to believe something before getting us with a 'aha' revelation, but rather the plot that doesn't ruin or elevate the film, no matter what happens - At the end, it's not about Catherine Tramell being the ice-pick killer or not  it's just about a cop, finally succumbing to his most basic impulses, and selling his soul to the devil. It's his presumption of a definite killer's innocence that seals his status as a passive character, but his weakness was the only possible driver for the sex scene. If plot there is, it only serves the purpose.The plot serves the purpose, not the opposite, indeed, but are you really surprised? What would you expect from a cop who accidentally killed innocent people, who lives alone, who's not bad-looking and who realizes he's the subject of one of the most beautiful women's fascination? -well, because besides being sexy, Sharon Stone is extraordinarily stunning and Verhooven's camera knows how to value it - the investigation, the horrific crime, the whole suspense, it all leads up to one thing : sex, sex and sex, and from the film's perspective: money, money and money. And for us: pleasure, pleasure and pleasure. That's the symbiotic triptych that makes the film works.Of course, this is not to diminish the cinematic merit of the film. It's easy to see in ""Basic Instinct"" some elements borrowed from the film-noir genre with Tramell as a modernization of the femme-fatale archetype. On that level, we're literally hooked to Stone's sex-appeal and during the interrogation scene, we can tell that the policemen in the room looks at her like we do, a piece of unreachable woman, a living fantasy; she's rich, she's beautiful, sexy, she has no boundaries when it comes to sex, she loves having new experiences, so many qualities that make her being a potential killer : a chance many of us would take, let alone, a flawed and loose cannon like Douglas' character.So, as we follow the mystery, the evolution, wondering if she or her lesbian lover or any woman who idolized us in the past committed the crime, we realize that these considerations hardly matter, because at the end, the 'hero' slept with her before the investigation was over. The plot reminds of ""Sea of Love"" but there are reasons why ""Basic Instinct"" stood out for posterity (besides the leg-crossing), its Sharon Stone and the way this cloud of false ambiguity never ceases to surround her. But as if it was victim on its own take, it's so ambiguous it never wants to take the chances to reveal us, who done it. Is it a flaw or strength? Again, does the pay-off make the film any less enjoyable? After 22 years, the film isn't as crude as today's productions. If I was a teen now, I wouldn't probably need to rent the DVD, with the Internet and the globalization of pornography, the standards of fantasies have been raised to infinitesimal summits  and for some reason, it deprives the material from the 'trashy' core that repulsed the critics. We look at it like a movie about a cop being alienated by his own lust, and making the line between crimes, sex and moral thinner and thinner. It's all about these 'basic' instincts, and that look in Sharon Stone's eyes on the iconic poster.Well, on a basic level, the film works, the directing is smooth and confident, and maintain an atmosphere of eeriness and mystery thanks to Jerry Goldsmith's score, one of the most defining of the 90's, and it launched Stone's career, making her the top-off-the-head star when it comes to define sexiness. So, just like a film of the same year, ""The Bodyguard"", it's not a great film, but if it managed to enter Pop-Culture providing new defining images of Cinema, well, it certainly achieved something.",Basic Instinct
41,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Fatal attraction.,7,3 October 2020,"Initially, this pulpy erotic-thriller seems schlocky in a rather distracting sort of way, content with shocking its audience simply for the sake of it. However, as 'Basic Instinct (1992)' moves further and further into its twisty narrative, it starts to feel like a dollar-store paperback and it becomes oddly compelling in its own way. The dialogue isn't especially clever but, once everything has clicked together, it just sort of works. The mystery at the heart of the piece is, essentially, revealed very early on, but the movie does a good job of introducing doubt into the fray; its outcome isn't as obvious as it may initially appear. Unfortunately, the film is one shot too long. This final moment removes any sense of ambiguity, something that would have made the ending - and, even, the entire affair in retrospect - actually rather interesting. Still, the experience concludes in a fairly satisfying way. In the end, the picture is entertaining despite its flaws. 7/10",Basic Instinct
42,g-bodyl,Must Be Hard to Find the Truth!,9,29 June 2015,"Basic Instinct is possibly the best erotic thriller to come out in the past three decades. It's up there along with another 80's classic, Fatal Attraction. If you strip away the outer levels, this film has the makings of a classic noir film, easily comparable to 50's noir films. Although it does feature graphic nudity, blood, and several plot twists more commonly seen in recent films. This is a very engaging movie with memorable performances and a fantastic ending. Paul Verhoeven's film is about a detective named Nick Curran who is assigned to a murder case of a former rock star. While investigating the case, he meets this author named Catherine Trammell, who was the girlfriend of the rock star and comes across as very manipulative. Nick is convinced that she is the culprit. But as the investigation moves deeper, he begins to second guess himself on whether or not she did the murder. The film is full of fantastic performances. Michael Douglas must have a thing for erotic thrillers as he starred in both this film and the fore-mentioned Fatal Attraction. He was outstanding in this role, which was a challenging one. The real standout here is Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammell. A very seductive, manipulative woman with some secrets. I also liked Jeanne Tripplehorn's performance as the police station's psychologist. Overall, Basic Instinct is a very seductive erotic thriller that is entertaining and shocking. This is how you make a very good movie dealing with seduction. The movie is not perfect, as I felt this film is a borderline porno with the graphic nudity and it distracted me from the story a little bit. That being said, I loved the story and I loved this film which reminds me of noir films from back in the day. My Grade: A",Basic Instinct
43,lesleyharris30,"Exciting Film that keeps you Thinking,",8,7 June 2015,"Basic Instinct is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very thrilling film in which we follow Michael Douglas as a detective investigating a very peculiar case, it's completely unpredictable, but if you're like me you will find yourself trying to guess what's going to happen, and getting it completely wrong, it's an original story that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The film does have many flaws, I think it jumps around too much, Nick Curran makes many different decisions on this case that it becomes hard to keep up with, and his many different mind changes and decisions can get a bit tiring at times, I also wasn't impressed with the anti-climatic ending, the story dosen't feel wrapped up and there are still many loose ends. Sharon Stone delivers an irresistible performance as Catherine Tramell, I would consider this to be one of the highlights of her career, sexy and creepy seems like a very hard thing to do, but she does it with pure class, she clearly studied her role and really became the character. Basic Instincy may have many weaknesses, but that dosen't take away from the fact that it's very exciting and will keep you entertained, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller. A detective falls for the chief suspect of a murder case, a writer whose novel depicted a killing identically. Best Performance: Michael Douglas Worst Performance: Wayne Knight",Basic Instinct

I actually thought she gonna kill him, the dramatic music really make it sound that she will definitely kill him in that bed!The music was absolutely brilliant, it gave ya that fuzzy vibe with a bit of romance and naughtiness throughout. I really applaud both Douglas and Stone for doing their sex scenes well because, I doubt no other actor could do the undressing for this film. They were so brave in letting the crew to look at them for five days. Gosh, that must have been exhausting!I really did enjoy the film, I think this is one of Douglas' and Stone's best. It might not be best to not watch this with your parents though, or else it will be super awkward for you enjoying the movie!",Basic Instinct
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Well remembered, but not a classic",7,31 March 2006,"At the time, Basic Instinct was considered shocking and new. In retrospect, in a world where much harder pornography is so commonplace, it's not got much sex appeal going for it. What I do like is the OTT game of cat and mouse between Stone and Douglas.Catherine Tramell is a writer of sleazy novels who lives out her pulp trash after she's written it. This would be fine if she wrote about saving the children or building churches but Tramell writes about sex, murder and betrayal. She's accused of murdering her Rock-star boyfriend by icepicking his head 86-times during a massive shagathon. She feels no guilt and no sadness and Detective Nick Curran regards her with utmost suspicion even though she passed a lie-detector test.Determined to find the truth among Catherine Tramell's web of pork-pies, Curran falls into her world of sin and seduction. Already a bad cop well on the way to cleaning up his act, all of his nasty habits come flooding back to him. The drinking, the snorting, the smoking...all because of a blonde. I would be impervious to this.In fact, Jeanne Triplehorn, who plays Curran's psychiatrist, is a billion times more sexy than Sharon Stone. Especially when she wears her glasses. But that's just my thing.One can accuse Basic Instinct of being contrived, overly-complicated and over-plotted but they'd be missing the point. I do feel that the irony of gutter-level fiction becoming real within gutter-level fiction would have been more appropriate and perhaps louder if Basic Instinct were a book, but as a movie it makes its point despite the high level tawdriness that most audiences are going think is all the film has to offer.Paul Verhoeven takes a Hitchcockian approach to the material as there are already a few connections to Vertigo. At one point in the film, Sharon Stone even dresses up in an outfit identical to Kim Novak (hairstyle and all). You can't help but notice the sleaze sometimes though. Like Michael Douglas walking around a nightclub in a horrible V-neck sweater or the 'infamous' leg-crossing scene with is only really notable for its unsubtlety.There are also some parts of the film which kind of date it badly. The production design and fashion is sooo early 90s. It's not the kind of story that oozes class but the outdated look kinda distracts. But the one amazing thing Basic Instinct has going for it is Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully haunting score. Truly one of his best in the latter part of his career.Add it all up and Basic Instinct is wildly inconsistent in terms of quality but the sheer OTT nature of plot is enough to keep it afloat. And all these years later, when we have mostly become impervious to titillation, people still remember all the skanky publicity and the aroma of sleaze will never quite die away. See past all that and you'll find a clever thriller underneath.",Basic Instinct

48,atlasmb,A Stylish Neo-Noir,8,28 October 2013,"Basic Instinct is a very stylish murder mystery, filled with attractive people and ambiguous clues that keep the viewer guessing until the final scene.As has been mentioned, there are echoes of Hitchcock's Vertigo throughout the film, including the San Francisco setting, the attire of the female lead (Catherine, played by Sharon Stone), the styling of her hair, the background music, the shots of interior stairwells, and the lead character (Nick, played by Michael Douglas) following Catherine around the city in his car. The apartment of Beth (played by Jeanne Trippehorn) might also remind one of Rear Window.Many of the characters have emotional/psychological problems like addiction, dependency, or worse. This makes it more difficult for the viewer to determine the motivations of the suspects. Nick--the filter through which we see all evidence--is flawed. We learn that he has had problems with cocaine and alcohol. Sexually, he is ripe for exploration and, maybe, manipulation.The film walks a fine line between revelation and obfuscation. In the course of the story, murders are committed, and we are given just enough information to pull us deeper into the mystery, but not enough to reveal the truth. Even the ending leaves the future ambiguous.This is an excellent mystery for the nineties. The acting is excellent, especially that of Sharon Stone who plays the rabbit we gladly follow down the rabbit hole where the rules of the game are confusing and constantly changing.",Basic Instinct
49,ironhorse_iv,"Bill Hicks and my Basic instinct was right, it's an unpleasant film.",6,7 February 2013,"It's sad to say that sex sells. Basic Instinct without a doubt sells, but it's just a sexy thriller that's got plenty of libido but not nearly as much brains as it thinks it has. It's extremely misogynistic and is very predictable. I was very disappointed with the whole movie, and had figured out the murderer within about 30 minutes into it. It's titillating, even exciting at times, but ultimately collapses under the weight of its own stupidity. The movie contained a lot of graphic sexual acts throughout the movie that makes it more of a soft porn movie in disguise & less than a film noir. It could have been better, if it cut down on the exotic a bit, and focus more on the story and give us a challenge. In the film's opening, Rockstar Boz is stabbed to death by a blonde woman with an ice pick during sex. We never see the woman's face -- just her blonde hair and, of course, most of her lust-inducing body. By just looking at the body of the killer, you can pretty much know who did it. The police find the dead body, and Det. Nick Curran, (Michael Douglas) was put on the case whom slept with his police-appointed shrink Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Triplehorn). Rather than getting a DNA test on the number one- suspect, Boz's girlfriend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a famous crime novelist, the cops interview her. I know DNA testing was still in its early stages in the early '90s but convicting using DNA evidence alone has been proved fact since 1988, four years when the film was set. Well, Catherine use the interview to make fools out of them. The way she manipulates psychology was superbly awesome. Without Sharon Stone as femme fatale, this movie is nothing. Still, most people would remember from this scene just the famous leg switching, and not the acting. Although, the detectives were too stupid to realize that there is something about her that doesn't add up. We sees Catherine using it to break ice during the film. She even mentions how her book is about a detective falling for the wrong woman and that she kills him. Isn't it very clear who the killer is? Sooner than later, Nick get into Catherine's sex life. The movie moves with the suspense involving Nick and Catherine. He's supposed to be following this woman as a suspect but is actually falling for her deadly charm since Nick is dumb like the other cops. Clearly this film points out the men are just horny dumb pervs who slept before duty. The film tries to do a lot of dumb red herrings such as Beth is revealed to have had a past sexual encounter with Catherine, that according to Catherine developed an obsessive fixation on her as Beth copy her. The audience is suppose to wonder whether Beth killed Boz as is described in Catherine's book to frame her. Not once in the film, does Beth show any bit of bi or lesbians feelings. Catherine does with a girl name Roxy (Leilani Sarelle). The film was strongly opposed by gay rights activists, who criticized the film's portrayal of bisexual women as a murderous sociopaths. The featurette Blond Poison reveals the uproar the film caused during the San Francisco filming. They deplored it as being ""anti-gay"" and a reinforcement of Hollywood homophobia due to typecasting particularly lesbians as twisted and evil, or just act lesbians to get men's horny. I think the heterosexuals can also be equally offensive, as some feminists like Camille Paglia starts breaking things down to banal symbolisms, the opening killing with the ice pick is interpreted as, ""Woman steals man's penis and uses it against him."" men find themselves involuntarily cringing. Freudian Pscyhoanalysts have retained the term instinct that the film refer to human motivational forces (such as sex and aggression), sometimes represented as Eros - life instinct and Thanatos- death Instinct, but the real term is motivational forces or drives to correct the original error in the translation of Freud's work. Psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, & therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does. So the film should be title 'Basic Drives"". It's clear why Joe Eszterhas was paid 3-million bucks for his script with its clever plot construction. Still there are pointless sequences like where Nick and Catherine engage in a car chase for no discernible reason other than to serve as a dire attempt to jack up the energy level. The film also has unlikeable characters. The hero Nick viciously rapes Beth in one scene. They're perfectly acceptable in the art of film, but Basic Instinct did go a little overboard with that sex. The film does good with its abstract images, the way it's shot from different angles, made it a little more elliptical, a bit less direct. The eerie Jerry Goldsmith theme gives the film a creepy tone. Basic Instinct was to transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, but the results are so-so. Following the success of the film, Ezsterhas & Verhoeven went on to collaborate on Showgirls. (Another horrible mess). Since release, the blue-ray version add more graphic violence & sex into the film.This film is an affront to taste. It's an over-baked mind control fantasy, brought to life by a horrible script, and relieved of meaning by a hair brained plot. It's all Tougue in cheek really like a perv. It's depends on your kicks.",Basic Instinct
50,The-Sarkologist,Psychological Manipulation,5,18 July 2021,"This is another one of those films that I have heard a lot about but never actually watched, probably because of the explicit sex scenes (and of course the particular scene where Sharon Stone crosses her legs, which is pretty much the one scene that everybody talks about in this film). However, as is the case, because this film does have a cult following (probably because of the leg crossing scene, though we don't see Michael Douglas do that when he happens to be in the hot seat), I thought it is probably one to watch, despite the gratuitous nudity and the quite explicit sex scenes. Then again, I suspect that half the reason for this is because the film makers were basically looking to push the boundaries.The film is what you would term as a psychological neo-noir, though I also suspect that this is just a title that is basically thrown about because people love to categorise things. Still, it is pretty dark, and in part does follow the trends of the original film noir classics, though of course they are attempting to bring it into the modern world, or at least into the 90s.Basically an aging rockstar is murdered in bed, and his girlfriend (for want of a better word), had written a crime novel that is pretty much the exact same circumstances. It doesn't sound as it she is a particularly famous novelist though since she made her money because her parents died and left her a fortune. She also has this habit of hanging around with convicted murderers, though she claims that it is to get into their head so that her novels can be realistic. Oh, she also had a double degree in literature and psychology. She certainly does play this quite well, and it is also interesting to note that she isn't the only psychologist in the film.At first the film looks like the story of how this cop spirals down in a descent of madness, but the reality is that the more we look at Shooter's character, the more that we realise that he is already on edge. He has quit smoking, drinking, and doing cocaine, namely because he had been implicated in the accidental shooting of two tourists, and had been let off as long as he gets his life in order. Mind you, the fact that he is sleeping with his counselor certainly doesn't help. Mind you the film has him take these habits up again pretty quickly, so there certainly isn't much of a descent with regards to the character.Rather, it seems to be more based on how Shooter is being played by Catherine, and the fact that everybody knows that he is being played by her except for him. Even the end of the film, where they are talking about shacking up together, you sort of wonder whether she has finished with him or not. It is clear that the counselor didn't kill the cop because that meant that she would have had an advance copy of the book - the only person who had read the ending to the story that Catherine was writing was Shooter, but it is interesting that nobody else picked this up.It is clear that Shooter was never going to pick this up because he had already made up his mind, and of course the clues that had been left about were enough to convince the police that the counselor was the murderer. However, notice that the only person that uses the icepick properly is Catherine, and the only other person that attempts to is Shooter, and he is pretty bad at that as well. That doesn't necessarily mean that because Catherine can use an ice pick means that she is the murderer, but it is a subtle hint that is peppered throughout the film.Also take note on the differing reactions she has to the death of the rock star, and the death of her lesbian girlfriend. She certainly seems to be impacted a lot more by the death of her girlfriend as opposed to the death of her lover. Then we have the idea at the end that she will no longer be sleeping with Shooter because she has finished the book, but we sort of wonder whether that is really the case.I won't necessarily say that this is one of the greatest films out there, but the film makers still really seems to be pushing the boundaries that existed at the time. On the other hand you really can't deny the fact that it has become a cult film, and Douglas and Stone certainly do make an enticing duo, especially since it is clear that Shooter is being manipulated throughout the entire film. It is interesting, and it certainly is now a movie that I can mark off of my list, but I won't necessarily say that it is one of the greatest.",Basic Instinct

52,johnnyboyz,"Manipulative, dominating and although somewhat incidental; the films holds up thanks to its concentration demanding plot and lead characters.",6,22 November 2007,"At a time when the world of film in America was moving out of the 1980s and into the 90s; fast and often confusing, perhaps poorly made and soon to be dated, mass produced films that had that aged grain and relied on a lot of adrenaline for most of the time films were being fazed out and a new 'sort' of film language was perhaps entering the fray. Films like the Rambo trilogy; Schwarzenegger films such as Commando, Predator and quite possibly even Verhoeven's own Total Recall  films like the Halloween sequels and the Nightmare on Elm Street series dominated the bloodthirsty calls from audiences  was it Reganism or was it merely a blip on Hollywood's vast radar? I have heard people talk and write about the 1980s perhaps being the 'worst' cinematic decade since sound was even introduced into cinema.True, the 80s did throw up the odd classic that has aged well over the years; films like The Shining, Raging Bull and Platoon but Basic Instinct is a new beast altogether. Where previous films were cheap and nasty looking, Basic Instinct looks fresh with characters that bounce off the screen; where previous films were very violent for the best part without too much thinking behind it all, Basic Instinct shapes its violence, builds its violence up in an eerie way and then releases it in a fit of mad and realistic fury; cleverly using it all very rarely and where bog-standard narratives revolving around revenge or last stand ideas were used as an excuse for lots of action and violence, Basic Instinct tells a tale that is clever (perhaps too clever) without actually giving us a satisfying climax.Strange then, that Basic Instinct should actually feel (at least to me) like a horror film of some sort. There we are with 'slasher' horrors that dominated the bloodthirsty audiences of the 1980s and there's me having an eerie sensation that Basic Instinct is actually a horror film. I felt this because of the bizarre instrumental music that starts up at various points, especially in the opening third. There is also an odd atmosphere of desperation throughout the film as Nick (Douglas) tries to crack the case whilst trying to ignore the heat building up around him and of course; the character of Catherine (Stone). There is also the clever use of the blonde hair iconography after the first murder takes place; shortly before we are introduced to two blonde women: one is a lesbian and one is bisexual although they are both lovers so already you're in eerie water and all of this combined gave me the feeling that something was not right  good and effective film-making.On the whole Basic Instinct is a film that is seductive; maybe too seductive if that's even possible. Catherine Tramell may be a bisexual, professional author who is qualified in psychology with her presence built up on screen whilst she is very much off it but here, she really does play some games whilst epitomising the femme fatale tag noirs carry; Basic Instinct falling into the 'neo' category. The way in which Catherine talks and acts to just about everything in the relaxed and carefree manner in which she does suggest 'psycho' and yet she can seduce, hint at her possible crimes, smoke in a building full of police officers when she's not supposed to and possibly even stab someone to death she loves with an ice pick suggests damaged goods. The character is clearly one right out of a male fantasy and thus; the seducing and dialogue she has feels incidental after the fourth or fifth time. This made me feel a little frustrated as it became so clear in what she was trying to do that it became obvious and how Nick continued to fall for her, being the smart and professional guy that he is, was disappointing as it was incidental.There are several times in which Catherine continues her game and yet it is obvious to us but not to Nick. We are seeing the film from Nick's point of view and yet he cannot crack the case; he is asked if he's ever taken cocaine or had an affair by Catherine (one person) in front of half a dozen strong fellow police men: does she really have the power to sit in a room and ask a question that will make a police man GIVING the interrogation squirm? All Nick needs to do is say 'No', truth or no truth. Basic Instinct is a film that will not appeal to everyone due to its complicated plot but may appeal to those who do not mind graphic sex scenes; likewise, people who will watch it for that reason and Stone's Tramell character alone will not enjoy the actual narrative. It's a film that is muddled in its target audience and its approach and yet it remains compelling for the best part of its runtime with standout acting performances and several good scenes despite its graphic content although it's not a film you would want to watch twice in quick succession; even if the plot does demand that you do so.",Basic Instinct
53,filipemanuelneto,Almost pornographic and overrated.,3,21 December 2016,"This movie revolves around the mysterious murder of a celebrity and the attempt to discover the killer. The main suspect is Catherine Tramell, a fiction writer who wrote a similar crime in a book. But she is intelligent and manipulative, as well as a sexual predator, and will not hesitate to seduce Detective Nick Curran. The film features the memorable interpretations of Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone, in the role that made her famous.The script is interesting but flawed and far from perfect. In fact, it has several plot holes, as the fact of completely ignoring DNA forensic evidence. The crime, moreover, loses importance throughout the film, as Tramell seduces Curran. In the end, nobody remembers the guy who died first. The hottest scenes are very choreographed, look spectacular and must have been very exciting by the time the film was released. Just remember the famous cross-legged scene, the most famous of the film and one of the rare occasions when an actress's vagina appears in a frontal scene with nothing covering it. Stone looks well in her role, although it was the only film where she shone. Douglas makes a good cop but does not build any erotic chemistry with her.Its an erotic thriller with ambitions of a police film, whose content grazes pornography in a dangerous way.

57,Vartiainen,"Games of lust, vice and intrigue",7,25 September 2020,"Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) gets assigned to a case involving the murder of a famous rock star. The lead suspect ends up being the girlfriend, a successful murder mystery author, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). Things start to heat up when Tramell develops a fixation on Curran, wanting to model her next lethal writing on him.Director Paul Verhoeven has always played with censorship. He's not afraid to show nudity and his characters are often quite sexually aware. Likewise in this film where sex and lust play major parts in the murder mystery and in the eventual relationship that develops between Curran and Tramell. And I think the film is better for it. Douglas and Stone have amazing chemistry together, but part of that is the script and the heights its willing to go ascend in search of that thrill.The film also has this great neo-noir style and feel to it. People smoke like chimneys, everything is grimy and filthy (the femme fatale excluded, of course), the protagonist is a cop about as dirty as they come and there are no real winners in the end. Only those that manage to trample others beneath them.If I had to name a flaw, I'd call the ending a bit subpar. It's not awful, but it's in a bit of a hurry and the audience doesn't learn relevant detail soon enough for it to feel earned.Still, this is a great film. Sexy, tighter than a violin string and filled with great acting. Classic for a reason.",Basic Instinct

59,GOWBTW,Twisted and sadistic!,10,10 March 2010,"When you have the finest stars in this movie, you can go no wrong. ""Basic Instinct"" has the gratification of sexual intimacy with a touch of wickedness and murder. Sharon Stone plays Catherine Trammel, an author who has the taste for sex and murder. Micheal Douglas plays the detective who suspects Trammel of murdering her lover. The best part of the scene was what else, the interrogation scene. She puts on that white dress with no undies and she shows her ""world"" to the instigators. However, there is another woman running around the city emulating her moves. The detective does have a steamy interaction with her, kissing her, tearing off her clothes, you know the rest. Seems like she would be innocent and so would Trammel. But the question would indeed pop up, ""Who is the ice pick killer?"" Some are definitely point the finger at Trammel, while others think is the copycat who's acting like her. Now that's a mystery. This movie is highly intriguing and indeed fun to watch. All I can say, it's for mature audiences only! 5 stars!",Basic Instinct

(Movie Quote)",4,20 June 2015,"Let's face it, fellas (and, yes, lesbians, too) - Once you've watched Miss Sharon Stone's famous leg-crossing scene - Is there really any other reason for sitting through the remainder of this over-hyped and underwhelming mess of dirty laundry to the bitter end? Well, is there? If you ask me - Basic Instinct is the sort of film that demands that the viewer believe that they are actually watching a intensely penetrating psychological-thriller, when, in reality, what they are seeing is a story that is about as shallow and predictable as you could possibly get.Here are 2 things that really irked me right off about Basic Instinct - (1) The on-screen chemistry between Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone totally sucked, big-time. It really did! (2) The unbelievably annoying in-fighting that took place amongst the big-wigs of San Francisco's police department. Man, these guys and gals were at each other's throats, non-stop! And, finally - I found Basic Instinct's 2-hour/10-minute running time to be almost unbearable to sit through. This film's budget was $50 million.",Basic Instinct
61,dee.reid,Quite possibly the hottest movie of the 1990s?,10,3 July 2012,"***This review is based on the unrated director's cut of ""Basic Instinct"" (1992)***To say that 1992's ""Basic Instinct"" is ""hot"" is an understatement. It's quite possibly the hottest movie of the '90s. ""Basic Instinct"" is a movie that offers a lot of exposed flesh - male, and, especially, female - but it is also a highly watchable and compelling, blood-soaked whodunit murder mystery. This last part shouldn't surprise us, since, after all, this movie is coming to us from ""RoboCop"" (1987) and ""Total Recall"" (1990) director, the controversial Dutch maestro of ultra-violence, Paul Verhoeven.""Basic Instinct"" was Verhoeven's fourth English-speaking vehicle, and his third major Hollywood feature overall. 20 years later, it's also his most financially successful effort to date. Part of that success, of course, can be attributed to its skin-factor and Verhoeven bringing his European filmmaking sensibilities to a sex-crazed American public. It's also Verhoeven's first non-science fiction effort since first coming to America in the mid-'80s, and is a return to his Dutch roots and the sexually explicit erotic thrillers he made in his native homeland of Holland (like ""Turkish Delight"").""Basic Instinct"" concerns the gruesome murder of a retired rock star named Johnny Boz with an ice pick. Suspicion immediately falls upon his blonde-bombshell some-time girlfriend, the highly successful crime novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). Investigating the case, are San Francisco homicide detectives Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and Gus Moran (George Dzundza). Matters are complicated because Boz's murder occurs in the exact same fashion as was described in Tramell's latest book. As Nick dives deeper into Tramell's mysterious past, he comes to fall into an intense and torrid sexual affair with her, just as the body count skyrockets.It all boils down to two questions: Is Catherine Tramell a sociopathic killer, or is someone deeply obsessed with her and trying to frame her for several gruesome murders? The list of possible suspects is endless: Could it be Tramell's jilted lesbian lover Roxy (Leilani Sarelle), or could the killer be Curran's police psychologist - and on-again/off-again lover - Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn)? Evidence continues to pop up at every turn to suggest two completely different conclusions. (Sounds a lot like Hitchcock, doesn't it? Verhoeven channels him quite skillfully here.)""Basic Instinct"" is quite a mind-blowing experience of a film. That it's coming from Paul Verhoeven shouldn't be a surprise. Verhoeven's films have always existed to provoke, while also simultaneously stirring up heaps of praise, and controversy and derision (just ask anybody on their thoughts about how eerily prescient 1997's ""Starship Troopers"" is post-9/11, and those who claim Verhoeven's version of the movie is a perversion of Robert A. Heinlein's original novel).I've always loved Verhoeven's movies (""RoboCop"" is one of my top-10 favorite movies of all time - #6). His movies have always been provocative and highly intelligent (which is often lost on American viewers, in my honest opinion), which is why I've always held ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall,"" and ""Starship Troopers"" is such high esteem. ""Basic Instinct"" is in another class in Verhoeven's career, because it's a return to the more simple productions of his earlier Dutch work. It has been said that ""Basic Instinct"" and the ill-fated ""Showgirls"" (1995) were attempts to create a wave of erotically charged, sexually explicit mainstream Hollywood features. ""Basic Instinct"" may have been Verhoeven's most successful attempt at bringing his esteemed European sensibilities to an American audience, but other movies that tried to follow in this mold were mostly failures (""Showgirls,"" namely).In terms of performances, the film has some great moments. Douglas is good as the troubled Nick Curran. He provides a forceful emotional center for the film, but it's really Sharon Stone's show. Her first interrogation is what has caused this movie to really earn its controversial reputation (the ""leg-crossing scene,"" and the unflattering portrayals of lesbians and bisexuals) and she really knows how to play up her sexuality in order to play on the desires of over-sexed men (and women). She's a new breed of femme fatale, a cunning and manipulative predatory woman who will stop at absolutely nothing to get what she wants.""Basic Instinct"" is quite a film experience. It's clearly not for everyone, but for those willing to take the plunge, it'll be an experience you're not likely to forget any time soon.10/10",Basic Instinct
62,Lechuguilla,Slick And Glossy,5,29 May 2010,"Set in contemporary San Francisco, the story pivots around a murder case in which an unknown woman stabs her lover to death in bed with an ice pick. Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) investigates, and soon confronts an attractive young woman named Catherine (Sharon Stone), a very wealthy playgirl. Is Catherine the murderer, or is the villain someone else? Complications ensue when Nick becomes physically attracted to Catherine. And the plot gushes steamy love scenes between the two, over and over ... and over.As a thriller and whodunit mystery, the film keeps the viewer guessing. From the start, we sense the film is playing games with us. And it is ... just as the characters seem to be playing games with each other. And that can be fun.Except in this case the characters are not very likable. Aside from Gus (George Dzundza), they're all savage sophisticates who reek of post-modern amoral selfishness. They're nothing if not clever and self-assured, just a tad too clever and self-assured for my taste. The Catherine character veritably oozes nervy slyness. And they all spout dialogue that's too artificially adroit to sound natural. The script's characters are as strikingly slick and glossy as the film's production values.Indeed, this is a big-budget film. The visuals look really good, with effective lighting and smart camera shots. Film editing is good. And Jerry Goldsmith's sultry score enhances a mood of stylish elegance.Casting and acting are generally acceptable, except for Michael Douglas, who looks too old to play the role of Nick. Further, he displays the very same facial expressions here that he does in most of his other films. Sharon Stone conveys the impression of an expensive hooker.""Basic Instinct"" tries to be a clever Hitchcockian thriller. But the script's underlying premise is rather silly and not at all believable. And the genuinely artistic look and feel of the production gets wasted because the characters are so off-putting. Overall, this film is worth watching, once, mostly for the plot's whodunit element.",Basic Instinct

This has a great supporting cast surrounding this sexed-up duo & all give excellent performances, especially Douglas & Stone. Yes the sex scenes are now famous & very Erotic but that's not why i love this film so much, it's because it's such a well made & beautifully filmed Detective Thriller & i love those!!!
Fact: movies like this (Thrillers) looked a million times better back in the 1990's & here the film is rich with stunning cinematography & a beautiful & exciting Thriller score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith (Gremlins, The 'Burbs, Sleeping with the Enemy & many more) so he gives the movie a Classy Suspenseful Classic Thriller theme throughout & his work in movies in apart of Cinema history in itself.

This was because they were so snobby! Nick (Michael Douglas) was a very attractive, good-looking, strict, and business-like guy in my opinion. I loved his style. The most gruesome and scary part in my opinion was when Johnny Boz (Bill Cable) got murdered. That was almost too gruesome and scary for me to bear, but I managed to sit through it. My favorite part, though, was when Nick yells at Dr. Garner. That was very entertaining.

That's another I like about the film, it keeps your attention until the end. The script is alright, I will say that it's not the best, but it's not bad writing either.

From the derivative, cliché-welcoming mind of Joe Eszterhas comes this overwrought Skinemax entry dressed up with Hollywood gloss, name actors, and a load of pop-psychology terminology (that fails to convey a brain under all the cop-thriller conventions). Yet with the creative force of Paul Verhoeven (""Robocop"") at the helm, ""Instinct"" seems to at least have a shot at being transcendent of its shallow pulp roots; unfortunately, the motives of director and writer clash, resulting in a beautifully-designed film where potentially interesting sexual (and, by default, psychological) politics are turned into exploitative fodder for prurient titillation. Additionally, Eszterhas' script traffics in a barrage of out-of-place sophomoric humor that further cheapens any pretense at a serious tone. But there's just something about this multi-million dollar pile of excess: perhaps it's the investment of credible actors like Michael Douglas, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and yes--even Sharon Stone--in roles churned out of a dimestore detective novel; or maybe it's the extended sex scene midway through (the one sequence that succeeds in prurient titillation); it could be the dialog, which is so ridiculously contrived it makes Michael Bay's action potboilers look true-to-life by comparison. But it's probably just the sex scene...and the now-legendary shot of Stone uncrossing her legs during an equally unorthodox interrogation scene.

75,nycritic,That Woman Stone,8,15 June 2006,"When have mystery writers looked this alluring? Not in recent memory -- the lot of them are average looking, ""handsome"" women that are better with words than with their looks, and anyway, they're not in it for the sexiness inasmuch as for getting paid for typing tens of thousands of words compiled in paper and Times New Roman print.Paul Verhoeven is a boy with a lot of dreams. Looking into his movie BASIC INSTINCT, itself a remake of an earlier movie he directed DE VIERDE MAN which told the similar story where a blonde woman stalked and insinuated herself into a man's life with dubious intentions, you would think he was trying to splash his fantasies on the big screen.He succeeds. Here the blond is not Renee Soutendijk but Sharon Stone, and Stone looks, talks, and acts quite a bit like Kim Novak at the time she made VERTIGO. Stone is by far the best thing in the movie and would it that she'd been born twenty years earlier: Hitchcock would have had a field day with her. She's the ideal cool blonde for the Nineties, the woman that is sensual but can be cruel and detached and men just love her the more for it. She's a fantasy waiting to explode unto men's pants, and she is fully aware of her power. I don't think that there's ever been such an actress, and it's too bad she hasn't been allowed to shine in memorable roles: there's an old Hollywood about her, something that says she's above it all, inaccessible, glamorous even when unkempt, the stuff that makes female icons. In Catherine Tramell, whether she liked it or not, she found her best role to date, and even though she would go on to CASINO, her work there is uneven but devours her male co-stars anyway.As Catherine Tramell Stone throws herself into the role and makes it her own. She has one of the most memorable movie entrances as a dispassionate woman who could care less what the authorities thought of her -- that if you don't count the first scene, which evolves from an abstract mess to a ferociously coupling man and woman whose blond hair covers her face. She later takes full control of an interrogation scene, and from then on, the movie is basically hers and no one else's. Michael Douglas has little to do other than act angry, bewildered, be in danger, lose control, and show that he had to work his a** off -- literally -- to compete with Stone's rock-solid body. Stone, on the other hand, had that voice, that thing around her swirling like moths to a flame, that just ignited the screen around her. It's never really a mystery as to the whodunit, but Verhoeven is fulfilling a fantasy of his own and letting the audience in on his dirty little secret. All he wants to do is to tease, bring in two more young babes, and let the sparks fly.And fly they did. A good yarn despite the plot holes, sudden hairpin turns of the story, and its ultimate resolution, BASIC INSTINCT is erotic in a raw, aggressive way that sets it light years from the more cerebral works of eroticism. It's great fun, because nothing can spawn more enchantment than seeing a battle of the sexes with the odds in favor of the woman, and in this case, a woman who is in power, in full command of her body, her mind, and willing to go to inhuman extremes to get what she wants.",Basic Instinct

Being an adult now, I thought this would be better recommended for me and... I really can see why. The film focuses on a detective who was problems involving drugs, sex, women and a female writer suspected of committing a murder. From that perspective, the story delivers a lot of tense and mysterious situations, making spectator wonder what was in Trammel's head when she writes those realistic books. Is she trying to get away with murder or is someone trying to set up for her? Along with a well written plot, there is a strong directing that helps the movie becoming suspenseful, even if using some old fashioned techniques-- or maybe they weren't old fashioned back then. Also, acting from Michael Douglas is AWESOME, making it hard to imagine him as someone other than Detective Nick Curran. Sharon Stone is great as well, and very sexy.

77,PredragReviews,Beyond good and evil...,9,11 May 2016,"Basic Instinct is far-and-away the best porno movie ever made. Judging it as a normal film, it is probably one of the best psycho-sexual thrillers ever made. If Alfred Hitchcock wasn't burdened by the stuffy censors, Basic Instinct is undoubtedly the kind of tawdry mystery he would have liked to direct, Frenzy being as far as he's ever pushed the envelope. Paul Verhoeven, however, presented to the MPAA what may have been the most sexually explicit wide-release film at the time, and he took great pride in it. Basic Instinct is about manipulation! The concept of transgression is translated into a modernized setting in a way that embraces film noir values, but at the same time feels utterly non-derivative. Much of the plotting and dialogue is wonderfully complex and subtle, and Verhoeven gives the whole thing a uniquely perverse spin. The music is worth a viewing by itself, as it is stunningly effective. In a film like this, you don't expect a score so lush and romantic, but it works. The film has perhaps two knocks. It is, when all is said and done, a whodunit, and carries all the negatives of that genre, the worst of which is the plethora of hints dropped to implicate this character or that. The other knock is more serious. There is a giant hole in the story which becomes apparent at the very end. The film features some truly gorgeous and moody cinematography by Jan de Bont (who would become a director in his own right with Twister and Speed). Every shot is carefully lit and the lighting is especially great during Nick and Catherine's big sex scene. The music gets a little bit over-dramatic at times, but overall really helps to accentuate the film's brooding feel quite nicely.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Basic Instinct

I suppose you could call that daring, but most of all it's just a really easy way to stir up controversy. With that aside, it really worries me how much I enjoy watching this movie. The thriller aspect is rather predictable and leaves plenty of plot holes, but I couldn't care less. I do believe I was supposed to question the killer's identity though, which I couldn't get myself to do. It's just rather obvious. The climax, which really consists of just one ending shot, is one of the best I've ever seen though, brilliant conclusion. As for the sex scenes, well I don't have anything against them, they're sort of well done. The hottest scene to me is the interrogation though, it's almost melting of the screen. It's what makes Catherine Tramell such a great villain. The musical score to this movie is also pretty much perfect. A masterpiece within its genre.",Basic Instinct
79,elliotjeory,Great film,10,21 October 2021,A classic 90s thriller. Very enjoyable and well written. Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are excellent and I loved the plots twists and turns. It feels old fashioned now but it has a retro feel to it and it's awesome.,Basic Instinct
80,tomsview,Basic BS,7,26 May 2016,"When I first saw ""Basic Instinct"" back in the 90's the thing that surprised me most was not the over-hyped sex scenes, but rather how stylish the rest of the film was.Although most of the attraction of the movie at the time was to see what all the fuss was about, I found that I was drawn into the story by Paul Verhoeven's classy direction.20-years later, the sex scenes, although not exactly tame by today's standards, now seem more routine, especially when almost every HBO mini-series has a nudity and sexual activity warning at the beginning of each episode.When you take out the leg uncrossing and the action in the bedroom, the actual story of ""Basic Instinct"" probably wouldn't fill out an episode of ""Columbo"", despite the feeling that Joe Eszterhas, if his autobiography ""Hollywood Animal"" is any guide, considers himself a pretty hot writer. Mind you with lines like: ""He got off, before he got off"" and ""That's her p#ssy talking', it ain't your brain"", who needs ""To be or not to be"".The energy one gets from the characters in the film is antagonism – everyone seems angry with everyone else – even buddies are angry with each other, and the sex is definitely angry. Charged up with that feeling, Michael Douglas delivers an over-the-top performance, creating an edgy character to say the least. Sharon Stones gives an understated performance – except in the bedroom – which gives her character the appropriate sense of danger. Beautiful Jean Tripplehorn quietly steals the show in the thankless role of Dr Beth Garner.One of the strongest elements running through the film is the police procedural aspect. It's this that Verhoeven makes work so well with his fluid camera that almost feels like we are gliding through the movie. Photography and direction plus Jerry Goldsmith's inspired score lift the film from what otherwise could have been a pretty ordinary entry.Jerry Goldsmith had produced an amazing body of work in the 60's, but just when you thought you had heard everything the guy had to offer, he reset the bar with works such as ""Chinatown"", ""Star Trek"", ""Alien"" and this amazing score. For many film music buffs, he is still The Man.Despite an ending that shouts that they didn't know how to end it, ""Basic Instinct"" holds up as a stylish mystery/thriller – although its good points are pretty well overshadowed by its reputation.",Basic Instinct
81,mjw2305,Definitely Not a Cheap Erotic Thriller,8,16 January 2005,"Catherine Tramell is probably one of the sexiest characters ever portrayed. Yes this movie is EROTIC! Yes this movie is a THRILLER! but don't fall into the trap of combining these words and thinking that this is a poor film with some naked flesh on view like so many movies before it and since.In my opinion this is the finest erotic thriller ever made, the erotic content is entirely justified, and is key to the plot. Make no mistake this isn't a cheap film, it is by all accounts a complex, thought-provoking thriller, that uses erotisism as a powerful weapon, and it achieves this without question.Both Stone and Douglas give incredible performances, and all the supporting cast are more than satisfactory.Watch it8/10",Basic Instinct
82,DeeNine-2,Near the apex of the sex/slasher genre,6,25 June 2004,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)We might call this trash, but if we do we'd have to call it very clever trash, the sort of trash one might find dumpster-diving in Beverly Hills.It stars Michael Douglas (who, by the way, has eclipsed the Hollywood power, if not the screen presence, of his dad, Kurt Douglas) and Sharon Stone who, as usual, finds herself in a part that requires that she take off her clothes and spout hard-edged one-liners: she does both with a certain delight that makes us think she is having a good time.He's a San Francisco homicide cop named Nick Curran with some questionable shootings hanging over his head, hence his nickname, ""Shooter."" She's a rich best-selling trash novelist named Catherine Tramell (pen name Catherine Wolfe) who likes kinky sex and other deviancies. It seems that her latest boyfriend (depicted in a blood-splattered opening scene) abruptly, shall we say, met his maker while in the arms of Venus, something predicted in Catherine's latest opus. We are made to believe that she could very well have been that Venus, although of course keeping us in the dark is part of the seduction.Jeanne Tripplehorn plays Beth Garner, police Internal Affairs shrink who just happens to be Nick's latest main squeeze. It seems that Catherine and Beth had a one-time intimate liaison while undergrads at UC Berkeley. We are led to believe that she too might have done the killings.So Nick has a choice, whom to believe about who's responsible for all the dead bodies, the blonde Catherine or the brunette Beth? Both seem a little wacko/sexy. He tries them both out, and we see a lot of skin and hear a lot of fast breathing, and are kept on the edge of our whoopee cushions until the very end--and after, actually, as though the purveyors were already counting on the sequel. I am reminded of a lyric from Elvis Costello's ""Everyday I write the book"": ""Even in a world where everyone was equal/I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.""In other words, what this film is about is money--money for the producers, director, actors, crew, etc. It's an extreme sexploitation thriller diabolically done with absurd plot twists and plenty of dead bodies and some diverting chase scenes (did I mention sex?); indeed I suspect that Basic Instinct will be recognized by future film historians as one of the primo examples of the sex/slasher genre, that is, as soft porn with a sick edge.But wait, why did I watch this? Uh...Sharon Stone amuses me like a comedic actress, but she ain't exactly funny, is she?Also it's interesting to notice that in these late eighties/early nineties sexploitation flicks it's the women who are the aggressors (I'm thinking also of Single White Female from the same year) while the men play a little tagalong. Michael Douglas is particularly adept at playing the sort of male who seems natural being dominated by Sharon Stone.Bottom line: mass mind trash, but worth seeing for its ability to define the Hollywood mentality circa 1992.",Basic Instinct
83,KUAlum26,Rent a porn instead,3,14 June 2008,"Writer Joe Eszterhaus was a name I was not familiar with before I caught this movie at the campus film showing in the fall of 1992. I would be cursing it after I saw this.While I have hardly anything against nudity and gratuitous sex in movies(and for that mater,seeing Sharon Stone being a part of it),i still found this film to be a long,repetitive exercise in misogynistic fantasy,spliced with bloody,agonizing murders. Michael Douglass(An actor who has worked long enough to do both ends of the spectrum of movie role)seems to be just thrilled to be involved in plenty of sex and action as the detective tracking Stone's murder mystery writing suspect. Jeanne Tripplehorn is his one-time love interest who may or may not be a suspect herself.Director Paul Veerhoeven would try one more time with the ""sexy"" movie theming in 1995's Showgirls,and while that movie would become code word for both bad and campy films,at least it would have some sort of naughty fun attached to it. This movie has,to me,never made explicit sex movies involving hot actresses seem less joyless or seductive(aside form the infamous interrogation scene that Miss Stone had ""no idea"" was filming without her undies). The plot takes you over 120 minutes to get you to an ending that will probably be,at best,only mildly satisfying and,at worst,right down aggravating.If you want to see movies with plenty of sex and some mystery to it,a soft-core porn or Skinemax movie would be a better bet than this two hour waste of time.",Basic Instinct
84,frankde-jong,Forgettable who done it or respectable neo noir?,8,28 June 2021,"Paul Verhoeven is probably the only Dutch director who really made it in the USA. After an historical drama ( ""Flesh+Blood"" , 1985) and two science fiction films (""Robocop"", 1987 & ""Total recall"", 1990) ""Basic instincts"" is his first American film in contemporary time.""Basic instincts"" is known above all from the scene in which Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is interrogated by a couple of detectives while she isn't wearing any underwear. This scene turned out to be a blessing in dsguise. It made the film famous, but (in conjunction with the opening scene) also gave the film the image of (too) heavily erotic.In the summer of 2021 the Dutch film museum had a summer program about film noir which ended with ""Basic instinct"" as an example of neo noir. So ""Basic instinct"" has to be a little bit more than just a sexy movie. In effect it has obvious characteristics of film noir with Catherine Tramell as the femme fatale and detective Nick Curran as her prey.In a film noir the legal world is not necessarily superior to the underworld. Nick Curran has private and proffesional problems and is a far cry from James Bond. In effect he reminded me more of Will Dormer (Al Pacino) in ""Insomnia"" (2002, Christopher Nolan). Funny thing is that in ""Basic instinct"" suspect Tramell is doing as much research about the detective as the other way round.Catherine Tramell is the femme fatale. She is dangerously attractive, an attraction that is only heightened by the fact that she is a suspect in a murder case. On top of that she is very intelligent (graduated in ... psychology of course). There was some criticism on ""Rain Man"" (1988, Barry Levinson) that autism does not always goes hand in hand with exceptional mental abilities. Of course Catherine Tramell is a very different character than Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman), but director Paul Verhoeven goes at great length to let us believe that also inside her a healthy brain (graduated) and sick mind (psycho killer) are living together.""Basic instinct"" is not just neo noir, it is also neo Hitchcock. Just like ""Rear window"" (1954, Alfred Hitchcock), the film definitely is about voyeurism (from another character and from the spectator!). Hitchcock combines vouyeurism with crime, Verhoeven with sex. Before the above mentioned interrogation scene detective Nick Curran had seen Catherine Tramell dressing herself. He, and the spectator, therefore knew that she was naked under her dress.Apart from the voyeurism theme there are few other Hitchcok trademarks in ""Basic instinct"". The haircut of Catherine Tramell is in some scenes very much like that of Madeleine in ""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock). In other words Shaton Stone is the ""Hitchcock blonde"" of ""Basic instinct"". Last but not least the scene with the hairpiece towards the end is almost a movie quote from ""Psycho"" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock).Not very Hitchcock-like is the way the story is told. Hitchcock liked the situation in which the spectator knew more then the lead character. The spectatcor knows who the murderer is, and is anxious to find out if the detective will also discover this ... in time. This is clearly not the way ""Basic instinct"" tells his story. Yes the clues pointing to Catherine Tramell are overwhelming, but is this in itself not suspicious? There is always the possiblity B that someone else is playing tricks with Catherine, and Paul Verhoeven keeps this possibilty in the air right untill the very end.According to Roger Ebert the final scene (is possibility A or B true?) so becomes a rather random choice. He maybe right. I don't subscribe however to his conclusion that ""Basic instinct"" is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in."".",Basic Instinct
85,Maciste_Brother,A midlife crisis masterpiece,2,13 July 2007,"In 1984, Paul Verhoeven directed a film called THE 4TH MAN in his home country of Holland. The story was about a writer, who happens to be a bisexual man, who gets his groove on with an alluring but icy blonde babe, who may or may not be a killer. The writer also ends up being attracted to her hunky boyfriend and a short-lived but steamy threesome of sorts takes place between them until all is reveal at the climax. The film was okay. Nothing earth-shattering about it but it was entertaining and original in its blunt depiction of bisexual desires of a middle-aged man, wonderfully played by Jeroen Krabbé. The film became a hit with critics and art-house audiences. Eventually, Hollywood beckoned and Verhoeven moved to California and made films in the US, mainly for US studios. Bad move, Paul. Success went to Verhoeven's head. In my opinion, all of Verhoeven's US films are tacky and trashy, and that includes his ne-plus-ultra trash masterpiece called BASIC INSTINCT. Unlike his other Hollywood films, including the film which derailed his US career, SHOWGIRLS, BASIC INSTINCT got good reviews and some actually think it's good. It's not. It's just a trashier, stupider remake of THE 4TH MAN.Verhoeven teamed up with infamous screenwriter Joe EsterHACK. Both took all the ideas from THE 4TH MAN and flipped them : the male bisexual writer in 4TH MAN became a female bisexual writer. Killings occur. Blood is spilled. The object of fear comes from a smart blond female killer. BASIC INSTINCT, unlike the Dutch film, which was actually daring even if the thriller story/film itself was average, is pure bloated cornball. Nothing more than an elaborate celebration of men in midlife crisis mode. It's supposed to be a thriller but the thrills are few and far between. An average Italian Giallo from the 1970s is more thrilling than this dud. TENEBRAE by Dario Argento, which is about a writer who's books ""inspire"" bloody murders is more satisfying as a thriller than this big budgeted affair.If the thought of watching men around the age of 50 or 60 getting their groove on with younger women excite you, well this film is for ya. The sight of Michael Douglas' ass is the stuff of nightmares. Seeing Michael disco dance with Sharon is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my entire movie-going life. That scene is even funnier than anything in SHOWGIRLS. The dialogue is just plain stupid (""The **** of the century""...sure). Even the famous ""flash the beaver"" bit is nothing to get excited about and I simply cannot believe how much press it got. The story? There's no story. Just people walking about, saying stupid dialogue with straight faces. In the end, BASIC INSTINCT is more about a witch hunt of sorts: it's more preoccupied with trying to catch which female character has had sex with women than trying to figure out who killed whom. Even if it takes place in San Francisco, the film actually makes the place look very macho and the only homosexuals you see are murderous lesbians/bisexual women. BASIC INSTINCT is as bad as SHOWGIRLS. In fact, it's worse than SHOWGIRLS because remove a game Sharon Stone and the evocative score by Jerry Goldsmith and you're left with nothing. At least SHOWGIRLS is endlessly entertaining in it's ""so bad it's good"" way. BASIC INSTINCT is just a bloated, slow story about men going through midlife crisis created by men who were simultaneously going through midlife crisis in reality. And there's nothing sadder or more pathetic than seeing grown men go through that phase.You're better off watching THE 4TH MAN than this hunk of old Hollywood cheese.",Basic Instinct
86,inspectors71,Pubic Domain,4,14 April 2014,"I was watching the mildly imbecilic Fox & Friends this morning (when they're good, they actually are; when they aren't, the channel guide on 47 is easier to watch) and a young woman came on to sing The Star Spangled Banner. She has been working toward performing our National Anthem in all fifty states before a certain deadline--for reasons I missed.Anyway, she was awful. Her pacing was off and she was flat (although that couldn't be said for her personally--two reasons she got some air time). The worst part of her performance was that hideous singing style perpetrated by the late Whitney Houston: The 31 octave, all over the road, bouncy-ball vibrato that is supposed to indicate emotional intensity but, instead, promotes bruised facial muscles from a raging case of emotionalitis. The girl's mouth was so contorted she looked as if she was riding a centrifuge for astronaut training. Her eyes were squinched shut, causing me to fear they would pop out the wiring holes in the backs of her sockets and squirt out her ear-holes, the only openings available.I have seen so many, many singers doing this Whitney Houston shtick. It's become the norm, the uber-emotional cliché for women and men singers. Houston made it popular, and a quarter century later, you can't get away from it.Much like Paul Verhoeven's quintessentially perverse and parodied Basic Instinct. BI is (and the initials were an unintended pun) not only iconic in its style and Sharon Stone's pubic flash, it has spawned from Verhoeven's diseased cranial womb a litter of copycats in content.Unless you can only--and I mean singlemindedly--think of Stone's spread legs or Jeanne Tripplehorn getting sodomized, I would strongly suggest you avoid this stylish petri dish of soft porn.The world is vulgar enough already.Which brings me back to Whitney Houston, a talented and tortured soul whose music was and is popular, and much imitated. I think it's time to move on from the quasi-Gospel warbling she made so famous. I also want to think--but don't expect--that the Verhoevenesque slickeries of cinematic sex and sadism have run their slime-covered course.",Basic Instinct
87,baumer,the sexiest movie ever made,10,16 June 1999,You know a movie achieves its objective when you think that a character is sexier than the person that plays her.  That is exactly what Catherine Tremell does.  She exudes sex and that is exactly her game.  She knows that she can play with people's minds by using her beauty and her sex appeal. And she does it so well.The epitome of this is the interrogation scene.  Much has been made about nudity in film but this is one of those movies where every breast and every shot of someone's crotch is done so to further the plot.  The famous scene that we have all witnessed now is a major part of Tremell's M.O.  She knows there are a room full of men asking her questions and she uses that sexuality to play with them.  And it works.The cast and the script and the direction are top notch and the movie feels like it is one big game.  And Catherine Tremell is the ultimate game master. I really loved this film and I rate it a perfect ten.,Basic Instinct

89,mentalcritic,Just goes to show how undersexed the American populace is...,8,10 July 2001,"Joe Eszterhas decided to plaigarise De Vierde Man, simply turning the bisexual author into a woman and making her the murderer in the process, so Paul Verhoeven decided to make it more the way Americans would have seen the original: a horror film. Throughout the film, all of the characters are cursed with aberrant sexual desires, relentless sexual desires, or sexual desires that might well get them killed. So the basic notion of this film is that one or two women in this film are extremely manipulative and sexual creatures who will kill each other or so-called innocent third parties just for the sake of manipulation.It really comes as no surprise Paul Verhoeven would only work on one more film with Eszterhas, given that the latter can't seem to see women in general as anything other than whores, nymphs, deviants, punching bags, or general tools for the men to use. I only know of one Verhoeven film besides Basic Instinct and Showgirls where feminine characters are displayed in such an utterly negative light, and in that one, Starship Troopers, the characterisation is more based on actual events in the lives of army recruits than a pointless, disabling fear. Mankind may well be afraid of the unknown, but women have existed at least as long as men, which makes misogyny like this hard to take at all seriously.Then there's the plot twists. Granted, this would be an utterly boring thriller if the same suspect was actually the killer all the way through the film. The best way to look at the sequence of murders is to believe that different people killed each victim. It makes things a little easier to digest, since the final plot twist pretty much negates every other in the film unless you look at it in these broad terms. I think Eszterhas was just trying to be clever for a change instead of hateful.Michael Douglas is right in his element as the burned out detective who lives from day to day without really caring about his work. Michael's easy-going, apathetic style of acting suits this role right down to a T, and it's a wonder he didn't get an Oscar. Sharon Stone is in her element as well, portraying the typically heartless woman who dominates the world of Basic Instinct. George Dzundza lends the film a bit of heart, and Jeanne Tripplehorn makes a pretty good stripper, but in the end it is just a tour-de-force of lines that are supposed to ""turn you on"" but instead make you giggle, primarily between Michael and Sharon.It is somewhat a historical irony that the films Paul Verhoeven is best remembered for, this one and Showgirls being the best examples, are far from his best work. His best English-language pieces created a massive buzz around the time when they were released, but their lack of promotion or publicity since then, at least before the DVD releases, has ensured that you already have to be a fan of Verhoeven to be completely aware of them.All in all, I would recommend you give Basic Instinct a look if you're not too worried about the rantings of a man who needs serious therapy brought to life on screen. It's clear from the outset that none of the actors sympathise in any way with their characters, but that's partly what makes it all work. Just don't expect anything nearly as interesting as De Vierde Man.",Basic Instinct
90,sharky_55,What is with you and this broad?,4,8 January 2017,"Everyone and the audience in Basic Instinct has seen a noir, or a Hitchcock. That is, except for our lead detective protagonist, who walks right into danger's arms and willingly embraces it. The first half and hour or so of the film is full of furious winking at the viewer. We have to play along with what seems like parody. Stone's reveal is with a knowing smirk on her face, as if she knows what everyone knows, that she will curl him around her fingers and get him to do whatever she wants. She might as well have a big, blinking sign floating above her head reading 'FEMME FATALE'. There is a bespectacled therapist ripped straight out of The Big Sleep, and who isn't fooling anyone; she immediately takes the glasses off, and is revealed to be another sexy conquest of Nick's after they air their dirty laundry out in the open. Catherine's massive inherited mansion seems to be eternally lit with shadowy rays of light bouncing off the pool - a perfect noir storm. She opens the door in revealing clothing and then proceeds to flaunt her naked body anyway in full sight of the detectives. No wait, that's not obvious enough. Later on she tells Nick a couple of key facts: one, she's not wearing any underwear, two, he'll pick up the drink and cigarette again, three, she's very good at lying, and four, she's going to kill him. Nick's partner, a bumbling, heavyset oaf, is oblivious to the searing sexual tension in the car. They're basically having sex from the first time they lay eyes on each other, and the dialogue is the foreplay. It's a wonder the actors can wrest with lines this heavy with a straight face. Every word is twisted, double edged, laced with the suggestion of ""we're gonna bang"". 'Sex' is actually only used seven times in the whole script, but with Verhoeven's penchant to linger on their sultry stares for a second or five too long, it seems like hundreds. Yet one could never accuse Verhoeven films of being straightforward - look to those who missed the point of Starship Troopers. This one's a little tricky. If you know Verhoeven you have to give him some benefit of the doubt. The first half of the film plays like a B-movie noir parody - not just once, but twice, Stone has an excuse to get out the ice pick and get stabby stabby. Haven't these people ever heard of an ice tray? The movie world is where a degree in psychology means you can pull a man's mind apart with ease - she knows Nick's whole history, his vices, his temptations. Beth, the actual shrink, sort of flails around helplessly. So Verhoeven shows that he knows the genre inside out, and that he's self aware. But the second half takes itself far too seriously. Having shown all its cards, it doesn't know how to conclude, so it just shoves the pair back under the covers. And after two hours of suggesting that there is more than meets the eye to this girl, it goes back on its word. Oh, she was serious when she announced out loud that she was going to kill him? I thought she was supposed to be the smart one.",Basic Instinct
91,aciessi,Overrated,3,9 April 2017,"Basic Instinct is campy, schlock-cinema. I was embarrassed throughout the entire film. It's a film set in 1992, written like a cheap knockoff of an Edward G. Robinson 40's film noir, laced with f- bombs. If a throwback was the point, maybe they should've done a much better job. All this film had going for it, and precisely why it was a popular in the 90's was Sharon Stone's sex appeal. She's a beautiful woman, yes. She crossed her legs... OOOOOH HOW SCANDALOUS.

92,Stampsfightclub,Inconsistent but interesting erotic thriller,7,18 March 2008,"Paul Verhoven's (Total Recall) Basic Instinct is exciting, erotic and entertaining throughout. However I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed come the end of the film.Sharon Stone (Casino) stars as Catherine Tramell, a sharp and smart novelist who is the prime suspect in a murder case after her boyfriend was murdered in bed with an ice pick, a similar situation which is used in her novels. Stone portrays her character well being very sophisticated in her own personal style.Douglas (Wall Street) is perhaps a stereotypical detective, being both moody and negative with a lot of situations.The plot so fairly consistent with Douglas' character Curran going purely on instinct rather than on solid fact. In someway it is inevitable what will happen though the film does provide a few twists and exciting moments such as car chases and showdowns to justify the genre.The ending was really puzzling for me as with everything that went on, it wouldn't make sense who the actual killer was, but then I suppose that's the fun side of the film, letting you figure it out.The direction is good but not great from Verhoeven. His close shots and fast changing style are creative if not always consistent. The famous interrogation scene was pretty poor direction in my opinion but the controversy is still quite heavy.It's a very erotic film with numerous sex scenes, hardly any of them really necessary to the plot but does give a sense of the passion of the characters and the situations in which they are in.",Basic Instinct

95,ivo-cobra8,My favorite Paul Verhoeven and Michael Douglas neo-noir erotic mystery thriller flick,10,28 April 2017,"This is my fourth favorite Paul Verhoeven film and my favorite Michael Douglas film it is a mystery psycho thriller that it is also neo-noir erotic thriller with Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. I always was been a fan on this film I have the unrated version on Blu-ray disc and I always enjoy this film. It is definitely one of my favorite Michael Douglas films. I think Michael Douglas does a great job as Detective Nick Curran also his acting performance is very solid. I think Sharon Stone does a brilliant acting performance as Catherine Tramell she is one of the best fictional character and main antagonist. Sharon Stone also did a cameo scene portraying her character in Last Action Hero (1993) Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. I love this movie to death and it is my favorite psycho thriller. I am not seeing the sequel because to me the sequel is a peace of sh**t movie and I hate it to death! I rent this movie in a video store on VHS tape when I was a teen in a high school and before that I watch it on TV and I like it and I enjoy it.Plot: A former rock star, Johnny Boz, is brutally killed during sex, and the case is assigned to detective Nick Curran of the SFPD. During the investigation, Nick meets Catherine Tramell, a crime novelist who was Boz's girlfriend when he died. Catherine proves to be a very clever and manipulative woman, and though Nick is more or less convinced that she murdered Boz, he is unable to find any evidence. Later, when Nilsen, Nick's rival in the police, is killed, Nick suspects of Catherine's involvement in it. He then starts to play a dangerous lust-filled mind game with Catherine to nail her, but as their relationship progresses, the body count rises and contradicting evidences force Nick to start questioning his own suspicions about Catherine's guilt.I love this mystery thriller, Jerry Goldsmith does a wonder music score that I love it. I love this movie to death. It is a bout a brilliant killer if you watch the unrated version you see a beautiful naked girl who stabs with an ice pick a rock star and it is a gory death, she takes an ice pick and she stabs him once through his neck once trough his nose, and once trough his chest. This is a really good nice nasty effect, it is pretty decently graphic and I think Rob Bottin did that effect who worked before with Paul Verhoeven.I love when Catherine Tramell re-crosses her legs to show that she is not wearing underwear beneath her short skirt, she smokes a cigarette in a white dress and she sits on a chair in the police station, man o man she is so sexy I would so love to date her. I would definitely fall in love with her like Nick Curran. Anyway the movie is such a mystery that even I am skeptical like Dana Scully from The X-Files, which I am one of those people who believe that Catherine Tramell did not murder people but she did manipulative others to murder for her. I am actually convinced that Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn) murder her husband, Johnny Boz and even Detective Gus Moran (George Dzundza).For 1992 it is definitely my favorite films the movie was nominated for 2 Oscars for best editing and best music score. I think it is excellent directing from Paul Verhoeven. Basic Instinct: The Director's Cut adds a couple quick ""cuts"" of violence in the movie's opening and extended sexual scenes. Basic Instinct really is the quint essential ""Who Dunn it"" film with more twists and turns playing on the audience than most. The acting is superb all around and Sharon Stone does a masterful job adding this enveloping and persistent tension with each encounter. What does shine here is the musical score. The main montage is a beautiful and haunting piece that is subtle yet very powerful almost on a subconscious level. Basic Instinct is a true movie of entertainment augmented by excellent directing, acting, music and plot.This movie has also actor like are: Bruce A. Young I remember him from The Sentinel (1996) Canadian TV series that my mom loved to watched. I thought I saw Mitch Pileggi in it from The X-Files, Shocker and Three O'Clock High (1987) and he is in it. It is Mitch Pileggi in a cameo scene. George Dzundza does a really solid job as Detective Gus Moran he is really likable. Jeanne Tripplehorn is also sexy and a fine job as Dr. Beth Garner. I also love that you have more serial killers in this movie more murders than just one. You have one car chase, you have beautiful women and I love the mystery's and backgrounds that Nick is investigating and chasing I loved it. The rating I give to this film is 10/10 Hitchcock would have been very proud of this effort. It's a very dark and sexually explicit modern day thriller. Sharon Stone is perfectly cast as the demented femme fatale it is my favorite film. Basic Instinct is a 1992 neo-noir erotic thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas, and starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. The film follows a police detective, Nick Curran (Douglas), who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy rock star.

96,Vivekmaru45,An erotic murder-suspense thriller about a woman that kills her lovers in the act of sex.,5,31 December 2010,"This film stars Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. It should have starred Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie. But you know CASTING in Hollywood SUCKS BIG TIME.Stone looks like an OLD B*TCH in the film and Douglas and OLD F*RT.The story could have been even better but no, after the opening and the mediocre sex scene between Douglas and Stone it gets worse and worse. I think even Lolita (old and new) is better than Basic Instinct and even The Realm Of The Senses, an erotic Japanese film based on a true story. If you have nothing better to do, go out for a meal or a walk than waste time on this.The film is handicapped by the censorship. Anyways who wants to see Douglas and Stone in uncensored positions. Cruise and Jolie would have been more tasty......Plot: a wealthy former rock star, Johnny Boz (Bill Cable), is brutally stabbed to death with an ice pick during sexual intercourse, homicide detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) is sent to investigate. The only suspect is Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a crime novelist who was the last person to be seen with Boz on the night he died. During questioning at police headquarters,Catherine engages in provocative behavior, refusing to extinguish her cigarette and uncrossing her legs under her short skirt, revealing she isn't wearing underwear.Because he accidentally shot a pair of tourists in an earlier case (while high on cocaine), Nick also attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner.Nick learns that Catherine's parents were killed when she was an adolescent, leaving her a fortune, that when she was majoring in psychology, her counselor at college was also murdered with an ice pick, and that Catherine's fiancé, a boxer, was killed in the ring. He also discovers that Catherine makes a habit of befriending murderers, including a woman who stabbed her husband and children for no apparent reason.During a visit to her house, Catherine taunts Nick with information that should be confidential. As police psychologist, Beth is the only person with access to that information. When Nick confronts Beth, she admits that she handed his file to Nilsen, who threatened to discharge Nick if he couldn't evaluate Nick directly. An enraged Nick storms into Nilsen's office, assaults him, and accuses him of having sold Nick's file to Catherine. Nilsen then suspends Nick, who goes home, spending the evening drinking. Beth visits him, but after a heated argument, he throws her out. Later that night, Nilsen is found in his car, dead from a single gunshot to the head. Because of their recent altercation, Nick is the prime suspect.A torrid affair between Nick and Catherine begins with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. Catherine explains that she will base her next novel's character - a cop falling for the wrong woman only to be killed by her - on Nick, while at the same time he declares his love for her and his unchanged intention to nail her for Boz's murder. A jealous Roxy tries to run Nick over with Catherine's car, but after a car chase she is killed in a crash. Her death reveals that she too had a murderous past. After Roxy's death, Catherine seems genuinely shocked, which makes Nick doubt her guilt. Catherine also reveals that a previous lesbian encounter at college went amiss, when the girl became obsessed with her. Nick, trying to learn more about the events, identifies the girl as Beth Garner, who acknowledges the encounter, but claims it was Catherine that became obsessed. When checking on Beth's background, he learns that her husband was shot several years earlier under unsolved circumstances, that Beth had another lesbian affair, and that Nilsen had investigated these connections the year before.When visiting Catherine, she explains that she has finished her book, and coldly ends the affair. Upset, Nick meets Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at a hotel. As the suspended Nick waits in the car, Gus enters the hotel and is stabbed in the elevator by a hooded figure, in the way described in Catherine's new book. Nick figures out there is trouble brewing and runs into the building, but he arrives too late to save Gus from bleeding to death. Hearing the floor creak, Nick grabs Gus's gun and turns to find Beth standing in the hallway, explaining she received a message to meet Gus there. However, Nick suspects that she murdered Gus, and as Beth moves her hand in her pocket, he shoots her. With her final breath, Beth tells Nick that she loves him. A dejected Nick checks her pocket, only to find her keys. The police arrive, and in a staircase discover a blond wig, a SFPD raincoat, and an ice pick, the weapon used to murder Gus, concluding that Beth ditched the items when she heard Nick coming up. A search of Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to brand her as the killer of Boz, Gus, Nilsen, and presumably her own husband - the matching revolver, Catherine's novels, and photos chronicling the writer's life.Nick returns to his apartment, where he is visited by Catherine. She explains her reluctance to commit to him, but then the two make love. Afterward, the conversation turns toward their possible future as a couple. While talking, Nick turns his back on Catherine as she slowly reaches for something underneath the bed. Catherine stops when Nick senses her stillness; he looks around with distrust in his eyes, and she throws her arms around him and the two resume making love as the camera slowly pans down to show what she was reaching for under the bed: an ice pick. Conclusion: Rent it if you're a Stone/Douglas fan. Otherwise go bungee-jumping or parachute off the Empire State Building. Score Douglas: 6/10. Sharon Stone: 4/10. Film: Average 6+4/2=5.",Basic Instinct
97,MihaiSorinToma,A great thriller with a great idea,7,27 December 2017,"A very wealthy, sexy but devious woman is accused of murdering a former partner and the case is being handled by a detective with a troubled past and an insecure present. He becomes attracted to her but as the time pasts, more and more people with connections to her get killed without a clear reason. As the story progresses, the detective is thrown away from side to side, not knowing who to blame or what to believe. He'll have to face his own problems first in order to get to the bottom of the mystery and this will prove to be a big challenge for him.It's a thrilling movie which throws the viewer into the middle of a puzzling killing spree, with an apparently clear murderer which nobody seems capable of convicting. Although it has very good actors and very good story, it evolves slowly and apparently without any direction, maintaining a slow pace for about half of the movie. Its finale is also unexpected and leaves room for controversy but also for a sequel which, in this case, is actually a good thing. It indeed contributes to the mystery but I would have preferred a bit more pace. Despite that, it is a very good movie overall.",Basic Instinct
98,russem31,Sexy!,8,2 April 2006,"Basic Instinct is another great film by director Paul Verhoeven (I thoroughly enjoyed his Total Recall which he made 2 years before this film and Robocop from 1987). He teams up again with Sharon Stone, who had a supporting part in the aforementioned Total Recall. This time Stone is the central character, properly cast as the sexy and risk addicted Catherine Tramell, who ends up seducing Michael Douglas' character Det. Nick Curran (also very properly cast). This sexy thriller, expertly written by Joe Eszterhas, also has many special scenes (especially the famous police interrogation scene where Stone ""sits"" in the chair - you know which scene I'm talking about!). And of special mention is the superb score by the late Jerry Goldsmith - this is one of his best scores (another great score is for Verhoeven's Total Recall). This is highly recommended - 8 out of 10.",Basic Instinct
99,Ben_Cheshire,This tongue in cheek sex thriller is probably one of the cleverest Hollywood genre flicks in a long time.,7,3 August 2004,"Sharon Stone's lover, an ex-rocker, is found dead, the weapon: an ice pick. Detective Michael Douglas is disturbed when he discovers (at the beginning) that Catherine wrote a book about an ex-rocker who's lover kills them with an ice pick. When they take Stone in for questioning, she teases Douglas, and tells him, creepily, that her next book is about a detective who falls for the wrong woman.I'll bet you a dollar that Paul Verhoeven's trashy Hollywood genre flicks will be rediscovered and fought for by movie buffs in years to come, the way the films of Douglas Sirk, Josef von Sternberg and Sergio Leone have.On first glance it seems like a generic, trashy detective thriller - but certain things point otherwise. Notice Goldsmith's score, which references Hitchcock's Vertigo and Psycho. Notice the similarity between Stone's hair and makeup in the famous beaver scene and Kim Novak's look in Vertigo. Notice the intentionally larger-than-life performances, the high-octane energy the scenes play out with, and, most importantly, the device of a writer who seems to be dictating the events of the movie. This makes you realise just how self-aware and self-referential the whole thing is.Not only is it that terrific thing: a genre picture that relishes in the genre, as well as sending it up a bit... Not only does it not take itself seriously at all, but its pulpy surface suggests all kinds of things about fate and the act of creation.The whole thing is wonderfully tongue in cheek, and just downright clever. Any snobbish critic would be deceiving themselves if they didn't acknowledge how great this film is.5/5. Not only thoroughly thrilling, but an immensely clever genre flick with a terrific premise, superb leads, and an incorrigable tongue in cheek self-referential attitude.",Basic Instinct
100,FloatingOpera7,A Classic Early 90's Thriller Which Made Sharon Stone A Star,10,10 April 2006,"Basic Instinct: Starring Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, Jeanne Tripplehorn, George Dzundza, Leilani Sarelle, Wayne Knight, Denis Arndt, Chelcie Ross...Directed by Paul Verhouven, 1992 Basic Instinct remains a popular thriller 14 years after its release and it's garnered fans, its DVD Collector Edition still sells and it made Sharon Stone a star. Now that Basic Instinct 2 is out, people are looking back to the original film. Released in 1992, it was highly successful at the box office and overall, its' a great film. I recall that at this time a lot of movies were crime/sex thrillers. Michael Douglas himself had appeared in such films as ""Fatal Attraction"" in 1987 opposite Glenn Close and only about a year after Basic Instict he was in ""Disclosure"" wit Demi Moore. In both films, Douglas was the victim of sexually powerful and truly evil, psychotic women. Sharon Stone took on a risqué role but instead of acquiring Oscar buzz, she merely accomplished the fulfillment of sexual male fantasies on screen or even tapped into the psychology of some women's repressed urges. Katherine Tramell is a bisexual novelist who is quite possibly a cold-hearted murderer. Various bizarre and brutal murders transpire in San Francisco and they seem to mirror the murders Katherine writes in her novels. Detective Nick Corran (Michael Douglas)is assigned the investigation of these horrific murders. The Interrogation Scene, now famous, was originally longer, but it was cut for the release. Stone uncrossed her legs and made 90's cinematic history, launching several comic parodies of the film, water-cooler talk, became a hit on late night HBO and Cinemax and developed a huge fandom. Detective Corran soon falls under Katherine's spell of seduction and intrigue. Her lesbian lover Roxy (played by Leilani Sarelle..whatever happened to her ?) is discarded and she soon becomes a possible suspect in the murders. But it's interesting to note how the story unfolds. Only those who knew Katherine intimately or in a level of friendship or family have died. The script may be tacked-on so that the writer Esterhazas didn't know what the truth was himself and was fooling around. No one knows who the real murderer is. It's hinted that Katherine killed her parents like the heroine in her novel, it's likely she's murdered ex-lovers and friends but it's also very uncertain. Other suspects show up. Nick Corran himself becomes trapped in this fatal world of illusion, deception, sex and murder. As Jon Corelli, a San Francisco cop, is Wayne Knight (Newman on Seinfeld) who had also appeared in Jurassic Park). George Dzunza as Gus Moran is a great role as is Jeanne Tripplehorn as the therapist and Nick's ex-girlfriend. This thriller explores human's inner darkness. The music by Jerry Goldstein is dark, brooding and haunting, though melodramatic. This is a classic in every level. It's too bad its sequel was not as good.",Basic Instinct
101,jessegehrig,"SEX! yes, like what goddamn animals do",2,22 April 2014,"This movie was made solely for eleven to thirteen year old boys of all ages. Sexually retarded. Not thrilling. Sharon Stone's character is impossibly unrealistic, completely f*cking silly, criminal genius femme fatale . Michael Douglas's character manages to be sadder and more pathetic than Sharon Stone's- he plays a tough veteran homicide detective on the edge. How was this ever entertaining to anyone? What the hell movie were THEY watching? Movie tries to be gritty and instead achieves high-gloss, movie tries to keep the viewer guessing even after the credits roll instead the movie should have worked harder on capturing the viewer's interest. It's like its a movie made by a guy thrice divorced, y'know, like maybe it's time to take a Women's Studies course at the community college.",Basic Instinct
102,eibon09,Psychological Nonsense,4,15 June 2001,"The acting in Basic Instinct(1992) ranges from average to very good. Michael Douglas perfects a kind of character he played in other films like Fatal Attraction(1987) and Disclosure(1994).  Clint Eastwood played a similar character like Det. Curran with better results in Tightrope(1984). George Dzundza plays the only sympathetic character in the entire movie.
The notorious interrogation sequence is the film's sole brilliant moment. Plays on the libido of the male characters in the scene as well as the male viewer in the audience.  Sharon Stone makes the scene work with her way of combining intelligence and sexuality.  Reaches the point of orgasm for the male viewer once Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs.
Basic Instinct's attempt at the Sadomasochism angle is tame and by the numbers.  The S & M angle is poorly executed and the scenes involving S & M are so dull that they make the Marquis de Sade bored to tears.  Mario Bava portrayed a more disturbing and shocking sadomasochistic relationship in The Whip & the Body(1964) then what's depicted here.  Its interesting that Det. Curran watches Hellraiser(1987), a horror film that includes a similar sadomasochistic structure.
The sex scenes in Basic Instinct(1992) are steaming with sensuality but strangely enough aren't much provocative.  They are not daring or envelope pushing to be in the same league as the sex depicted in Last Tango in Paris(1972), The Man who Fell to Earth(1975), In the Realm of the Senses(1976), Crash(1997), Romance(1999), or the controversial Korean film, Lies(1999).  The sex here is mainstream fare disguised as NC-17 material. Henry Miller wrote more erotic and envelope pushing material sex in his books then what is present here.
Sharon Stone gives one of her two best acting performances in a motion picture she has starred in.  Her other standout performance in a film is on Martin Scorsese's Casino(1995).  Sharon Stone in the film is a dead ringer for the character Madeline played by Kim Novak in Vertigo(1958). Sharon Stone plays Catherine Tramell with a cold and intelligent sexual allure.
The ending uses a plot twist that is irritating as well as manipulative. The writer reuses the plot twist of the much better, Jagged Edge(1984). That film uses the final scene plot twist with better results because its not forced on the audience like in Basic Instinct(1992).  An ending that fails to satify or surprise in a convincing manner.
Basic Instinct(1992) rips off many basic ideas and themes from Dario Argento's Tenbre(1982).  Its take on censorship, media violence, sexual tension, and the soul of the artist isn't as deep or thought provoking as in Tenebre(1982).  More annoying and pretentious than Tenebre(1982).  Basic Instinct(1992) in an inferior take on Tenebre(1982) that lacks the flamboyant directioral flair of Dario Argento.
Nothing more than a water down reworking of Paul Verhoeven's The Fourth Man(1984).  The only difference is the role reversal of the two main characters.  Lacks the daring style that made The 4th Man a masterpiece. Basic Instinct and The 4th Man are examples of the differences between filmmaking in Hollywood and filmmaking in Europe.
A film with a mystery that Sherlock Holmes would solve in five seconds is not a very good movie at all.  The sex turned rape/sodomy sequence is the only scene that is inspired by disturbing passages found in the works of Henry Miller and the Marquis de Sade.  Dorothy Mallone gives a memorable turn as a murderous friend of Catherine Tramell.  Sharon Stone dressed for Basic Instinct(1992) in the same order of clothes Kim Novak wore for Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958).
Homage to Vertigo(1958) with the beautiful San Francisco scenery. psychological tension, and erotic obsession.  Kim Bassinger was the first actress picked to play the role of Catherine Tramell.  An NC-17 feature that doesn't have any of the gutsy quality of other NC-17 movies like Henry & June(1990), Damage(1991), Bad Lieutenant(1992), and Crash(1997). Basic Instinct(1992) is a typical Hollywood film that never is as cleaver as it makes itself to be.",Basic Instinct
103,Horror-yo,"Timid thriller, ultimately disappointing",6,19 October 2017,"I remember looking at the ratings and thinking they were oddly average for a 90's thriller (they're usually very good) with excellent lead actors Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone, just as great in this one. I knew it had at least one very controversial scene, and couldn't understand why the subpar general opinion.It turns out the film is brilliant thriller cinema for an hour - very good acting, memorable scenes, honestly excellent dialogue, and coherent and accessible - but seems to drop what it's been doing for that hour as the later developments draw closer to a different sort of feel, and quality. The film starts to become pretty self-indulgent, as the intrigue slowly becomes more convoluted and complicated to follow, with too many characters now to remember and too many dynamics between them. It fell into the trap it set up for itself, of wanting to be unpredictable continually throughout two hours of playtime and constantly evolving as it reaches the deeper ends of the plot - but it feels just too complicated in the end and whatever expectations are stemmed earlier in the viewing are gone as it progresses in the second hour. The ending just doesn't match the quality of the first hour.Now on the more philosophical aspect, the film is in the end too timid. Its over-the-top sexuality and explicit depiction of lust don't serve a purpose we learn at the end if not a weak aesthetic of its own; and as I've read somewhere the film merely 'exploits' the dark side and never 'explores' it.5.5/10",Basic Instinct
104,braddugg,"A taut, erotic thriller and indeed one of the finest murder mysteries ever made.",8,17 August 2014,"A taut, erotic thriller and indeed one of the finest murder mysteries ever made.Sharon Stone steals the show by seduction and eroticism. The film is known for the erotic scenes above everything else. It has the most paused moment in cinematic history, which is the the leg crossing scene of Sharon Stone.There is lot of eroticism which I suppose was needed for the plot, as the protagonist Catherine Tramell seduces men into her plot and uses them as tools for her own written plot. So no qualms, with the nakedness of characters in this. It never seemed that it was over the top or it could have been avoided. This marks the ingenuity of the writer. It is called smart writing by embedding some real erotic scenes to make it more interesting.Murder mysteries if written well are generally interesting, but this was had the oomph factor with Sharon Stone as protagonist. She did go the full throttle and dug deep into the character. She made the enigmatic writer into a well balanced and a reasonable character. That enigma which she carried on screen transpires even in the viewers mind. At least it did drive my mind, so I rate her acting in this very film highly. Never before and never after did I see such a composed performance from Sharon Stone and probably I never will again. But what she did in this film alone is enough for her lifetime. She made Catherine Tramell one of the most memorable characters in Cinema History. I am surprised that Sharon Stone overshadowed a star like Michael Douglas in the film. If written well and acted with complete submission, the roles becomes supreme and raises above the script. Taking the script itself to greater heights.The credit for this film must go to the writer Joe Eszterhas and the director Paul Verhoeven. every dialog is terrific and the choice of words is meticulous and apt. Technically, I loved the editing and it's cut at the right moments with right space between each scenes. The transpiration of emotions is well conveyed and the acting indeed by all is great. Just that Sharon is above others in this means she is just greater by an inch above others. The production values are good and it makes a film stand long and I suppose, even 20 years later, people will watch it with same reverence as they did 20 years earlier (from now, 2014) when it was initially released.A 4/5 for this, undoubtedly for the lines and Sharon Stone.",Basic Instinct
105,bregund,Ridiculous,3,9 March 2020,"Each scene is more ridiculous than the previous one, but the film lost all credibility when a middle-aged Michael Douglas in a muscle shirt walks into a dance club surrounded by people half his age. Thank god he didn't dance, although I'm sure it was in the script. I can understand the appeal of Sharon Stone in this film, she has the perfect amount of edgy lunacy for this role, her voice and eyes are amazing...she's like a high-octane version of Joan Crawford in her youth. It's too bad the rest of this film is so dopey, clearly Joe Esterhazs or whatever his name is has never seen the inside of a police station and learned everything he knows about cops from watching television, as Michael Douglas's character breaks rule after rule in a never-ending series of improbable scenes. No detective would ever be allowed to break this many rules without facing severe consequences. As I've said before, San Francisco is a marvelous location for filmmaking, you can point the camera in any direction and get some breathtaking backgrounds, it's too bad that most of this film comprises claustrophobic interior shots, characters are always arriving at someone's house or leaving someone's house or sitting in someone's house, with a car chase scene thrown in every once in awhile to keep you awake. One gets the impression that Douglas tried to repeat his groundbreaking role in Fatal Attraction with another Crazy Blond Chick storyline, but the effort here falls flat. He was only forty-seven at the time but closeups reveal that he has probably spent too much time in the California sun all his life, which makes the sex scenes rather uncomfortable to watch. If that isn't bad enough, throughout the film he attempts to ratchet up the drama by shouting or lashing out at his partner, the suspects, his boss, etc, a signature move for Douglas, which isn't half as annoying as Al Pacino's tendency to scream his lines, but it seems a rather transparent attempt to make more of the ho-hum storyline than it is. Character actor George Dzunda follows Douglas's lead and joins in on the shouting at several points, and the other actors all follow suit, but shouting doesn't legitimize conflict, it just looks like shouting to keep you awake, the verbal equivalent of car chase scenes.",Basic Instinct

107,acedj,"A well done, dark thriller",8,13 November 2019,"I always wonder how to review a film. Some people talk about the plot, where I like to talk about my reaction to the movie itself. I guess I will start doing both, This movie is about a cop played by Douglas, that is lead detective investigating a brutal murder. The lead subject played by Stone, is very much a femme fatal. She is an author, who writes, you guessed it, murder mysteries. There are several sub plots that I won't get into as they contain spoilers.
This movie is excellently executed. It was mainstream, but right on the cusp of being too explicit with the sex scenes to be called that. I have watched this movie quite a few times, and find new things to appreciate in in it every time. It should be noted that this movie is what made Sharon Stone a household name, and not just for her apparent ease appearing nude on film. She breathes life into her character and does it very well. To me, her performance in this movie is akin to Heath Ledger's Joker portrayal. Not quite on the same level, but very close.The best part of this movie, again to me, is that the end is sort of ambiguous. It does not directly say boom here is your killer.",Basic Instinct
108,pfgpowell-1,"B*gger the critics: if you like film noir, you'll love this",8,16 June 2017,"I first came across Dutch director Paul Verhoeven when I saw Robocop in the late 1980s, and I found his sly, quietly satirical humour appealing. I didn't catch Basic Instinct when it first came out in the early 1990s, to all-round notoriety for 'that scene' and was generally panned by the critics, and the next Verhoeven film I caught was Black Book, which did not impress me much at all. I thought it was cheesy and derivative and ordinary. As for Starship Trooper and Total Recall, I haven't been there yet, but plan to in the next few days. But Black Book rather put me off Verhoeven.Last night I watched Basic Instinct and the admiration was back, though not just for the quiet, satirical humour, but for the man's utterly successful recreation of film noir. He has it off to a T: everything, from the convoluted plot, the snappy 'cool' dialogue', the incessant, urgent background score and, of course, the irresistible femme fatale who you just know is a total wrong 'un but, like the male lead, just can't help falling in love with. In addition, and more subtly, he has the camera perpetually moving, nothing is static, which makes for far more interesting shots, but which also adds to a certain intrigue.I caught the uncensored version which features rather a lot of sex. I gather the cinema release was rather more restrained and I have to say I don't think the film particularly gains from the extended sex scenes. Some might prefer more rather than less of Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone writhing this way and that, but to be frank I can take it or leave it. I'm not at all offended, but there is a suspicion it is all just a little gratuitous. But what the hell.The convoluted plot is, of course, entirely ludicrous and utterly implausible, and once you get a moment to reflect - though that moment is quite delayed by the enjoyment of Verhoeven's success in carrying it all off - it doesn't really bear scrutiny at all. But as is oddly the way with these films, Basic Instinct has somehow won you over - especially if you like, as I do, all those hard-bitten film noir - and you just think 'oh, what the hell'. 'Why would so-and-so go to all that trouble just to...?' - oh, what the hell. It's that kind of film.The critics didn't much like it and had it not had Michael Douglas as one of the leads, they all suggest would have been banished to B-movieland. But the fact is, it did (have Michael Douglas as a lead) and it wasn't.Especial mention must, though, go to Sharon Stone for her performance and, game lady that she so obviously is, 'that shot' (you know, the one which so excites adolescent boys). I also caught her in Scorsese's Casino in which her performance won here an Oscar, and I'm not at all surprised that she was honoured (she was nominated for her role here, but didn't win). There is in Basic Instinct - although not in Casino - an amused, detached quality to everything she does which is wholly appealing, but which doesn't undermine the film but add to it.So there you have it: if you like film noir - melodrama squared, snappy lines and all the rest - go for it. By me, at least, Basic Instinct comes highly recommended.PS Even the - equally ludicrous - final shot of the whole film which pretty much makes a nonsense of all that's gone before can't be faulted. As I say, one of Verhoeven's attractive qualities, for me at least, is his quiet and understated satire.",Basic Instinct

110,supertom-3,More than just sex scenes!,8,23 July 2004,"Sure its dirty minded, and extremely violent, but underneath all of Paul Verhoevens trademark sleaze there is a great film noir thriller to be seen. The film has a sense of an old 40's or 50's film noir, but of course with the 90's boundaries in taste and graphic nudity. The story is quite involving and there are plenty of twists and turns and unresolved endings. Michael Douglas is good in his role and must have really enjoyed film shagging Jean Tripplehorn and Sharon Stone, while it is Stone who steals the show as the writer Catherine, whose books write about murders that are apparently being copied by a murdering female. Its very steamy but the cinematography and the score are all very good and the film is more clever than merely T&A.

The Journey To The End Was Sexy And Satisfying",8,17 September 2019,"Sharon Stone stars as a femme fatale in this movie entitled,""Basic Instinct"". Michael Douglas and Jeanne Tripplehorn co-stars with Stone in this murder mystery that is full of sex scenes and memorable dialogues that made this a memorable movie more than 27 years ago at its time of its release.When a former rock star Johnny Boz was murdered,San Francisco police detective Nick Curran finds himself in a web of lies and deceit upon solving the case that involves suspect such as psychologist/novelist Catherine Tramell and his personal psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Garner. As Curran tries to find the murderer,he himself gets involved with both Garner and Trammell in more ways than one that involves sex and entanglement. Although both Tramell appears to be a guilty one,the screenplay near the end swings pointing towards Garner as the person who did it.But in the final scene,we get to see the memorable ice pick under Tramell's bed while she and Nick were making love. In the end,screenwriter Joe Eszterhas present the viewer two possibilities and the viewer has to toss a dice to take his/her pick between Garner and Tramell.While the conclusion could be controversial,the other elements of the movie such as memorable lines and the sex scenes that involved a high amount of nudity are enough to satisfy the viewer especially if one is trying get entertained in a movie and who is not looking for a masterpiece. In this regards,the movie delivers indeed.",Basic Instinct
112,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,THE ULTIMATE EROTIC THRILLER! ICONIC! LEGENDARY!,10,14 March 2021,"In one sense, I am really glad I waited until I was 36 years old to watch this movie for the first time (in 2021). In another, I cannot believe I slept on it. In the last decade I've become a massive fan of Paul Verhoeven as a filmmaker, but somehow this one managed to go without being seen until now. I've known ""about"" it since it came out, and still! Verhoeven's widely slept-on 1973 masterpiece, Turkish Delight, is one of my Top 10 favorites of all time, and Total Recall has been one of the most iconic movies of my entire existence since it came out. Now, you can add Basic Instinct to the collection of what I would consider ""my favorite movies"". Verhoeven has now got 3 of them in there.First of all, this is the ULTIMATE erotic thriller. I have never seen another erotic thriller that even comes CLOSE to capturing what is accomplished in this movie. Every single piece of softcore trash cinema and sexy thriller that came out through the rest of the 90's wanted to be this movie so badly, and none of them ever came close to touching it. Everything is turned up to 11 and it's so over-the-top I was cracking up for the majority of the 2 hour and 10 minute runtime. The dialogue is a riot all the way through - it's like fiendish poetry. The Jerry Goldsmith score reaches maximum levels of epic dramatic. The violence goes way beyond what I expected my whole life. The sex is as gratuitous as it could possibly ever be in a high-budget R-rated movie - it is pretty much the highest budget softcore film ever made, and the most effective one, with so much more to offer.On that note, Sharon Stone... what in God's name... did that woman sell her soul to the devil? How could one person be so captivating, so ultimately sexy with one single performance? Her body is flawless. The pacing and the beats of her performance.... her expressions, her looks, her outfits, her delivery of lines.... it is literally one of the most captivating acting performances I have ever seen. I never could have understood what she truly achieved here if I had watched this as a kid in the 90's - NOW it makes so much sense. This is 100% iconic. Legendary. She is a queen. And everyone else adds just as much to the cast. Michael Douglas is equal parts despicable and someone you're rooting for - complete duality, just like real people. He truly brings the intensity and complexity to this masochistic character. Co-star Jeanne Tripplehorn also brings an extremely memorable, dynamic, and intense debut performance as well, managing to make a serious mark even amongst two explosive leads.I don't even know what else to say other than I FEEL COMPLETELY INSPIRED by this fantastic, legendary piece of cinema, and if you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you do immediately! Also, read about the all the back story stuff! It's fascinating! This movie was extremely controversial when it came out, and there were tons of activist groups straight up rioting over it upon it's release. 13 women rejected the film due to it's sexual content before Sharon Stone had a chance at the role - Verhoeven pushed for her and had to do a lot of work to convince Michael Douglas to be down. IT'S ALL FASCINATING!",Basic Instinct
113,asb_deutsch,This is probably the silver standard of erotic thrillers,6,10 July 2017,"Took me till 2017 to finally see this. Not as shocking or sleazy as expected but Sharon Stone definitely lights up the screen, and this is one of her best roles. Basic Instinct is a non stop thrill ride from start to finish and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end. Paul Verhoeven has made better films, but Basic Instinct is still a well acted film. It is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, and between eroticism and exhibitionism.

Occasionally Basic Instinct receives airings on cable. If you have seen this movie then you know it was responsible for making Sharon Stone who she is today. The scene when Sharon spreads her legs while being questioned is my favorite I just say oh yeah. The scenes of passion with Michael Douglas are so hot and steamy that you are kept well in suspense during the entire movie. Basic Instinct is certainly a movie that will go down in history for the sexy feelings it inspired.

117,Pookyiscute,Celebrity porn...,6,19 January 2006,"This was an interesting film. A bold, and daring piece from a European's directorial perspective. Although there is an interesting, enticing and creative premise of a story that lies within this film, that does not go without saying that there was a bit too much sex. From the opening scene until the very end, we see naked breasts, buttocks, and even some female genitalia. It leaves you feeling a little dirty, being inside this character's world, seeing what she goes through, during the entirety of the film.Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas star in 'Basic Instinct', which should tell you right away what their basic instincts are. A man is dead. He has been stabbed to death during intercourse with an ice pick. The culprit, a beautiful blonde, whom we suspect is Cathryn (Stone). However, throughout the entire film, we are never really sure or clear 'who done it'. The story is well-written, and keeps you guessing, wondering if it was Cathryn, or if we are just led to believe that.I would say that since Michael Douglas, usually just stars in films, and never actually acts, this was a good role for him, because he just needed to show up for shooting. However, Sharon Stone, was excellent, and quite possibly the best role and work she's ever done in any film. The role really was made for her, and it shouldn't even need to be said, that she was absolutely stunning in the movie.Jeannie Tripplehorn, was also in the film, and was the not only the most beautiful I've ever seen her, but also the most noteworthy. She, aside from Stone, was probably the best actress on set. It's a shame she hasn't become more popular than she has. She is a very talented woman, and should be noted on her work. Especially in this piece.It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's good. It does keep you guessing, which is something I like about a movie, nothing too predictable. However, it can be slow at points, and is nothing compared to, 'Fatal Atrraction', which is the best Douglas film ever. However, if you like watching stars have sex throughout half the film, and like watching people get murdered, then you just might like it.",Basic Instinct

The plot was very interesting and kept me intrigued till the end which had a twist that I had to search the meaning of on Google as I wasn't quite sure about what it meant. I see this movie has gotten mixed reviews from both critics and audiences; one of the reasons could be because of the explicit nudity and sex scenes which there was quite a lot of. Morally this is a bad movie, however it's very intriguing and would definitely recommend anyone to watch it; Just make sure to watch it alone and not with any family members obviously.",Basic Instinct

120,jonathanruano,Basic Instinct,5,24 November 2017,"The main criticism levelled at Basic Instinct is that it does not work as a ""who done it"" movie, because the evidence suggests that either of the two characters committed the murders. But I never cared about the ""who done it"" aspect of this movie anyway. Basic Instinct is really about how the basic instincts of two people - Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and Catherine Trammel (Sharon Stone) - brought them closer together. Over the course of the movie, Detective Curran slowly realizes that he does not like staying off cigarettes, alcohol, and cocaine and being a good cop. Instead, he wants at a deeper level to break free of the shackles and release his basic instincts -- which include aggression, uncontrolled rage, wild lovemaking, and much more. There are a number of important events early on in the film, which indicate that Curran is headed in that direction. He is chided by Catherine Trammel to start drinking and smoking again. His aggressive, dominatrix lovemaking with Dr. Elizabeth Garner suggests that they are not a good match. Finally, Curran becomes the object of Trammel's seductive and complex mind games. The unfolding of this plot halfway into this movie is masterful. Sure the scene where Trammel reveals to the police officers that she is without panties is something of a climax. But even then, watching Detective Curran fall to pieces and revert back to his basic instincts is fascinating. But then the second half of the movie broke down for a number of reasons. At the half point, all the creativity and invention (which made the first half so enjoyable) had been exhausted and all that was left was a dumb-down and sleazy screenplay. Screenplay writer Joe Esterhaz ran out of good ideas and basically came up with a second and third act which sabotaged what could have been an elegant and highly intelligent psycho-drama. Lines like ""f*** of the century,"" ""that's her p***y talking,"" and ""f*** like minks and raise rugrats"" are really beneath the dignity of the intelligent actors uttering this dialogue. Equally disappointing is the unmotivated violence. I am not against very violent films in principle. But when the violence is unmotivated or lacking a convincing rationale, then it ruins the film. Why not come up with something more intellectually challenging for the actors and the audience, rather than just inserting a bunch of sleazy trash? Unfortunately, once Esterhaz' screenplay took this turn and then added all those silly ""who done it"" elements, Paul Verhoeven's excellent direction could not save this film from the trash heap. A pity really, because the director and screenwriter were really onto something with their premise.",Basic Instinct
121,Panamint,Effective Thriller,7,20 November 2006,"Effective thriller with Michael Douglas at his dark-side best. If not for Douglas's suffering dark-side portrait, this film would probably not be nearly as watchable.Sharon Stone is nowhere near Douglas's acting league but is adequate for this rather one-dimensional role. Her character doesn't really break any new cinematic ground. We have seen this pretty girl/mentally unbalanced stuff SO much in movies. For example Rebecca DeMornay ""Hand That Rocks the Cradle"", Teresa Russell ""Black Widow"", Laraine Day ""The Locket"" (way back in 1946).You will really enjoy the great supporting cast. They are all terrific in roles ranging from sleazy to heroic. Even long-ago Oscar winner Dorothy Malone is used to creepy effectiveness in a non-speaking part.The score is effective thriller music. The dark cinematography is fine, and the sets are way above average and are a great accomplishment.Will definitely hold your interest but rates no better than a ""7"" because it is so utterly devoid of any worth or believability other than entertainment value.

Though it's not mentioned in the interviews of either star or director, the wonderful car chase brought to mind that 'other' car chase Frisco Bay movie, 'Bullitt'. But given the remarkable landscape of the area, why not? One would be a fool not to push the stylistic envelope as far as the censors will allow. A film that would have made The Master of Suspense proud, methinks, and one that he himself perhaps would have done, had Joe Eszterhas' very fun script been around, during, say, the time of 'Frenzy', when Hitchcock was at his cheekiest. A fantastic date movie too, by the way...",Basic Instinct

Basic Instinct is glossy entertainment via director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Esterhasz responsible for the equally loopy Showgirls and Starship Troopers. Basic Instinct is Sharon Stone's movie, and it's her only performance of note, and it's a good one. The film probably wouldn't be half as good without her. Her character is the element that makes it click and Stone's performance makes it memorable. Just compare her to Madonna in the Basic Instinct ripoff Body of Evidence and you'll appreciate Stone's sexy cool. The plot hardly matters, and the rest of the cast does a good job of appearing to take it all seriously which, fortunately, is something that the audience doesn't have to do.",Basic Instinct
125,Old Joe,A brutal murder. A brilliant killer. A cop who can't resist the danger.,10,31 January 2002,"The 90's was a decade that was blessed with many great movies, yet there are none greater than that of Basic Instinct. It is a truly great film. With Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone heading a wonderful cast, this was one of the great thriller movies I can remember watching. It had everything a movie could want, a bit of mystery, sex, intrigue and murder. There will need to be a pretty good movie to replace this classic from the top as one of the greatest all-time thrillers. Nick Curran is a disgraced San Francisco police detective who helps investigate the murder of a prominent city official. Curran has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse although he is clean now. Catherine Tramell, the chief suspect, a spoiled rich girl with a background in psychology is toying with Curran's mind. When Curran is taken off the case, he enters into a dangerous relationship with Tramell, which could have bad implications. Soon everyone Curran comes into contact with turns into a suspect.Undoubtedly, this movie is most famous for it's high level sex scenes that it contains. While I did enjoy them, they are overrated just a fraction. I must admit Sharon Stone has an incredible body and she certainly knows all the moves. These scenes also turned Michael Douglas into a sex manic of sorts and partially ruined his first marriage to Diandra Luker. Yet they create quite a mood for this film and are the main reason why it was the success it was. The cast was great in this too. Michael Douglas is a Hollywood legend and this film only made him even more popular. His role as a the down and out cop was great. Douglas has some great films to his credit. These include Romancing the Stone, Fatal Attraction (not to similar to Basic Instinct), A Perfect Murder, and of recent Traffic (alongside his second wife Catherine Zeta Jones) and Don't say a word. Then what do you say about Sharon Stone? Before this film she was virtually an unknown, then she stormed on to our screens, without letting audiences take a breathe. Her film credits include The quick and the dead, Total Recall and The Specialist.
Other cast members include Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Curran's ex-wife and Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Garner. Her role made me feel very anxious to realise what was going to happen. The sex scene involving her was a little hard to take. Then you have the good guy of the film, Gus, played by George Dzundza, but the way we see him go is also too much to handle. One other actress I did recognise, was Leilani Saralle, who played one of Catherine Tramell's gay lover's, Roxy. Basic Instinct had a very good director, that being Paul Verhoven. He made this film extremely well and any other director might have got it wrong. He has made some other good films including Robo Cop, Starship Troopers and Total Recall. He did do one big flop, that being Showgirls. He commented on that film by saying `I think it was bad too'. I am sorry Paul, but you were right. Basic Intinct's script was pretty good in how it left you dangling. It was like you were in a big game of cat and mouse. I can understand that some people might not like it for that reason, but I thought it was good. The movie also had a great musical score attached to it, giving the movie a chilling feel to it. So, all in all Basic Instinct is a film that I will always remember. It was so controversial that where I come from, I remember people needed to show there ID to get into the local cinemas, because of its sexual and violent content. I don't blame the cinemas for doing so, because it is not suitable for young eyes to see. If you want to watch a great thriller, then sit down and watch Basic Instinct. Trust me its nice'!Rating: 5 stars or 10/10",Basic Instinct
126,Ziya90,"Clean film, dirty thoughts",7,2 January 2010,"Some critics criticize Basic Instinct as if it is different from other thrillers in a bad way or as if it is bizarre. Good or bad, the point is that the film is a 'normal' thriller. A critic says that it segregates against females (as if this is the only movie in the history of cinema which the killer is a female!) It is a cheap, pointless, homophobic exploitation movie and he gives two out of five. This is one of the most ridiculous and malicious reviews ever written probably. It is also written that there are some dialogs which the audiences should react against. I don't remember, but as he writes, Douglas says something like I hate myself, because I slept with a woman together. Hmm. This means that the film hates women? Firstly, let's suppose that in a movie, the killer is a male. Does it mean that the movie is man hater or feminist? In a movie, the killer is female, does it mean that the movie tries to say that women are bad and have a tendency to be murderer? What a ridiculous and irritating thought! What is the solution then? Serial killer movies no more. Or the killer must be an alien comes from outer space or an animal like Jaws? Basic Instinct is not a homophobic movie, they say this so that there is no male frontal nudity? I won't comment on it. They tell lie, I don't know why, but probably because they are angry about the movie. Basic Instinct is not an exploitation movie. Are all the movies which shows us sex scenes exploitation movies? At least this is not. By the way, there are only two or three sex scenes that is also necessary except the one in the beginning. The rest is suspense. By the way, I see Disclosure, Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct as a trilogy, there is Michael Douglas in all of them and three of them are about a man who is troubled with a woman. Returning to the film, it is stylish visually, a good thriller. In addition, it gives men even a lesson. To me, It says that be in possession of yourself !",Basic Instinct

129,blakiepeterson,A Trashy But Stylish Erotic Thriller,8,23 May 2015,"""I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid,"" mystery novel writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) purrs to a room full of doubtful detectives. Being investigated is the murder of Johnny Boz, a rock 'n' roll star slashed to death during a round of cocaine-fueled, sadomasochistic sex. ""Basic Instinct"" opens graphically with his demise, a voluptuous blonde the killer. Tramell, his girlfriend, is, as it so happens, voluptuous and blonde. Coincidence? ""I wasn't dating him — I was f*cking him,"" she elaborates to the police. She didn't care enough about the victim to commit a heinous act; why waste her time jeopardizing her well-being on a wealthy lay? Clever as Tramell is, though, we aren't so sure of her innocence. So ""Basic Instinct"" spends the rest of its duration toying with us, unsure whether to label her as another red herring in the whodunit puzzle or a murderer waiting to be verified.""Basic Instinct"" caused quite a stir back in 1992, fought against by gay activists for its ""evil"" depiction of lesbians and bisexuals and threatened by the MPAA for its explicit scenes of sex and violence. The non-stop controversy only lead to box-office domination — audiences were dying to see what all the fuss was about — and viewing the film nearly 25 years later is a guilty pleasure, a treat in the erotic thriller genre. Everyone will find something to be offended by here, but taking ""Basic Instinct""'s unsubtle portrayals of the sex and death 101 trope seriously is a mistake. On display is a stylish, sometimes deliriously entertaining modern day film noir, ready to titillate, manipulate.Michael Douglas portrays Nick Curran, a troubled cop heading the investigation of the above mentioned murder of Johnny Boz. Though Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, sexually wily psychopath, is the leading suspect, Curran immediately finds himself obsessed with her, despite knowing that she might be an ice-pick killer. The two embark on a torrid, often dangerous, affair — and as things heat up, murders reminiscent of Boz's death begin to pile up.With his split-screen techniques and emphasis on slow-motion and close-ups, one can only imagine what Brian De Palma could do with material like this. But Paul Verhoeven, a master of seedy storytelling, makes ""Basic Instinct"" so deliberately (and masterfully) noiry that merely focusing on that moment in which Stone may or may not have exposed her vulva (I'll get to that later) is a travesty. Most modern audiences remember the film for its soft-core sex scenes and slightly giallo slashings, but some critics, me included, hold ""Basic Instinct"" in high regard for its exquisite style.Sure, the sex is provocative and the violence is thrillingly over-the-top, but those who view ""Basic Instinct"" as a shameless would-be porno are missing the point. I can't say that the film is so smart that it would avoid covering the camera with Vaseline to highlight its inherent steaminess, yet Verhoeven's meticulous neo-noir flickerings make the film distinctly unforgettable instead of laughably arousing.Famous film noir trademarks include the decoration of rooms by the shadows of Venetian blinds and rising cigarette smoke, and not a scene in ""Basic Instinct"" goes by without masking itself with at least one of the two. Every inch of the police station is nicotine-laced and hazy, and Tramell looks lost when she isn't curling a Lucky Strike in her manicured fingers. If one were to consider what a 1950s era film noir would look like without the censors, without the black-and-white shimmer, ""Basic Instinct"" might be the answer. Yes, the film can be trashy, but it's too precisely designed to shrug off as trashy trash. It's divine trash, on the spectrum of carnally subdued art with its coffee-stained cinematography, its sweeping score.Even the infamous interrogation sequence, a staple in those ""most-paused movie moment"" slide shows that adorn spam websites, is a truly fantastic scene. Take away that nanosecond in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and deftly reveals a nude nether region, and you get a superiorly shot sequence of filmmaking, an unforgettable moment in '90s cinema. The room is almost metallic in its placidity, the detectives as nervous as they are curt, the central Tramell a femme fatale goddess with her white minidress, white jacket, white cigarette, white pumps. The scene is fraught with sexual tension, a superior Stone cooing slick jabs (""What are you gonna do, arrest me for smoking?"") at a handful of men sweating their libidos off. Though lasting just a few minutes, the entire sequence is absolutely stunning in its hush-hush game of sensual cat-and-mouse.Douglas' portrayal is perhaps too unlikable for someone who is supposed to be the hero (he's much too prone to yelling, insulting, having existential crises to actually enjoy being around), but Stone is the only actor that matters — in the process, she steals the film and creates one of the most unforgettable female characters in noir history. ""Basic Instinct"" is sleazy, all right — but it isn't the tactless blockbuster you may remember it as. It has flashes of brilliance and flashes of unpleasantness and brutality — never, though, will you find yourself watching the clock.",Basic Instinct
130,smellthecult-com-1,"Sex thriller, apparently",5,24 December 2009,"Every so often something courts controversy for, well, no discernible reason. This movie is one such example.At time of release, much fuss was made, not only about the sexual content of the movie but also, perhaps mainly, the fact that the protagonist of violence was bisexual, as if penning such a role is somehow a blanket statement that all bisexuals are serial killing, novel writing femme fatales. Which is clearly true.So besides the teat count and sexual politicking, is it any good? Well, not really. The plot itself involves a gradual obsession building between detective and suspect, and the manipulative games we play between genders, here amplified to the nth degree.Verhoeven handles graphic violence well, and there is plenty of bloodshed here, with necks attacked with some venom, usually whilst naked but, the odd moment of brutality aside, there is little here to enjoy.The infamous upskirt shot is worth a look, I guess, assuming you don't have a broadband connection, but is hardly a reason to watch the damn movie in the first place.Stone is perfectly competent in her role, with Douglas his usual self and, I must confess, I felt compelled to fast forward the scenes with him copulating as it reminded me too much of a frog mating ritual I saw once on Wildlife on One.The film noir leanings are only slight and, disappointingly, it is crippled somewhat by an absolutely atrocious score by the usually highly reliable Jerry Goldsmith.Disappintingly average all round, kids.",Basic Instinct

132,MF210,Very Entertaining,8,8 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Basic Instinct is not a great movie, but it is an entertaining one. Paul Verhoeven has done a good job with the movie, and I think it is one of, if not his best film. It is a bit Hitchcock like and there is one scene ripped off from Psycho, but Verhoeven accomplishes more than De Palma ever would with his Ripoff movies. Basic Instinct has a similar story to Vertigo, but not in a real obvious way like De Palma's Body Double. It is about a cop and cool, Icy blonde but doesnt involve any claustrophobia or anything. There not ending is definitely not the same. Basic Instinct is a mix when it comes to the acting. Michael Douglas is fine, but he overdoes his role a bit. Jeanne Tripplehorn is awful. Sharon Stone is the real reason to see this movie, she does a great job as an Icy, Cold blonde. Theres not much character development to her, she just does things by Instinct, which is the reason for the title.
Basic Instinct is violent but not overviolent. The Violent scenes are very far apart. Though they are a bit bloody, I dont think they will make anybody get sick. Verhoeven has done worse with Violence. Basic Instinct has other technical aspects to it. It has a very suspenseful original score, beautiful Cinematography, and is a well edited film. Basic Instinct does have other problems, like the relationship between Tripplehorn and Douglas is not believable at all. But for the most part, the movie will keep you interested.",Basic Instinct

I wonder if HOLLYWOOD COULD MAKE THRILLER MOVIE LIKE 'BASIC INSTINCT' ANYMORE?",Basic Instinct

What a hilarious moment in cinema history !I don't understand the haters of this movie, they are probably just taking it way too seriously, or are not very comfortable watching these types of risque movies !This is an intriguing film , I have seen it several times, and it never fails to thrill me ! Just watching Michael Douglas does that alone anyway ! And as for all the male viewers, I would imagine that Sharon Stone does likewise .Great story / plot , good acting , and good direction / camerawork . It's got everything.A must see for everyone , a classic murder mystery thriller !!",Basic Instinct
135,The_Orenda,Two Thumbs Up.,3,18 July 2004,"I barely liked this movie. Everyone I know gets hyped about 'Basic Instinct,' says it's great, Sharon Stone's hot and you see a little something extra. But, so what? Past everyone's favorite bit and the ridiculous, borderline insulting sexuality, which nothing resulted from me personally, there were other parts that you could like, something of which just pushes it above being just another disappointing joke.A retired rock star gets a rock n' roll murder in the wrong way, with an ice pick the weapon at the scene. Cop Curran is on the case and suspect #1 happens to be rocker Boz' girlfriend. Unbeknownst to the detective, is that Catherine already has plans for him.'Basic Instinct' has a unique art that gels and sets a mood for the viewer. It's a style perfect not only for the audience, but it makes the acting more convincing, the writing more easy to digest, and the critics more readily to accept. Stone and Douglas are perfect in their roles and everyone still loves Catherine's interrogation by the cops. Do not expect too much, only during the sexuality, and you may enjoy it.",Basic Instinct
136,ohlabtechguy,"Far-fetched, open-ended and with no likable characters",5,5 November 2014,"Just saw this movie on TV. Story line was totally unbelievable as the major character, a homicide detective, engages in a sexual relationship with both his murder suspect and his police mandated psychoanalyst. Total loss of professional integrity here. Can't even begin to like the Douglas character. The story gets convoluted and twisted as it develops. Never quite sure who the murderer is, but it appears as if Stone is all along. The last scene leaves you wondering if she eventually will kill Douglas or not. Typically, the villain gets what he deserves in Hollywood movies. In this case, it appears the villain gets away with murder. It gets bonus points for uniqueness here, and for decent acting by the cast, but the visuals of the movie are low tech, gritty and boring. And there are NO likable characters with any integrity.",Basic Instinct
137,HorrorFan1984,Basic Instinct,8,25 July 2020,"A police detective gets wrapped up in a twisted game of cat and mouse with a mystery novelist who is the main suspect after a series of murders occur in San Francisco.The film starts with a man having sex with a blond woman whose face we don't clearly see. As they are having sex, the woman picks up an ice pick and stabs him 31 times, killing him. Police detective Nick Curran is assigned to the case and the main suspect he investigates is the dead mans lover Catherine Tramell. Not only was she sleeping with the deceased, but she wrote a mystery novel years prior which had murders committed with an ice pick making her look even more guilty. As the film goes on, a few more murders are committed and some secrets are discovered. Is Catherine this psychotic genius who is tricking the SF police force, or is the killer someone else completely? All is revealed in a classic twist ending.Sharon Stone as Catherine is confident, sexy, and seemingly dangerous throughout the whole movie. She outsmarts the detectives so well when questioned for the murders. Michael Douglas is great as Nick Curran, battling the fight for justice, the fight against alcohol, and the struggle between loving and hating Catherine. The cat and mouse game played between Douglas and Stone is so compelling and intriguing. They ooze sexual chemistry in every scene. I also really enjoyed the performance by Jeanne Tripplehorn who makes her film debut as police psychiatrist Beth Garner who is all tangled up in Nick/Catherine.All in all, Basic Instinct is a thriller that delivers in the mystery and psychological departments. The way Tramell toys with Nick is done in such a smart way which speaks to the direction, acting, and writing of the movie. Highly recommended.8/10",Basic Instinct
138,tequila101,A Powerful Thriller that Achieves Greatness at every Minute,9,12 January 2011,"I saw Basic Instict not too long ago and I thought it was really good. At one stage the story had a similar twist to the 1974 classic Black Christmas and most of the time it was a creepy hit and run. The film was very psychological and i had some trouble with the ending but that was OK. Trust me this film has many good things going for it and the premise is just sexy and chilling.Michael Douglas who is detective Nick is on a search for a Killer who has sex with them and then murders them with an ice pick by random. As Sharon Stone who plays the sexy, spicy, charming Catherine is questioned, Nick seems to get mind played and seems to fall into her trap at every corner, making it close for her to have him finished. Then as the story progresses we see many others things arise which adds a sense of power to the story.If you haven't seen the film yet, I won't pull off any spoilers: As of that, Basic Instict does it job well with the amount of lovely sex scenes and the amount of eeriness it shows us. The film in all ways was very powerful because at times it felt this was going to happen. It was also hard to get. Even if there's quite a bit of blood, like I said some of the scares are kept up well. I give it a 9/10 P.S: I give it a 9/10 because this is Sharon Stone's best acting ever. I just couldn't get over how well she did in this film, mainly by an evil character. Her role was just so overwhelming. And Jerry Goldsmith (from Link & Rambo) is doing the score for this film and like those two films, I really thought this music had charm,sadness, sometimes depression and some sequences of brutality.",Basic Instinct
139,jmillerdp,"Overcooked, Overwrought!",6,30 October 2014,"Overcooked Joe Eszterhas-scripted film that basically features occasional sex and lots of yelling! Paul Verhoven is the perfect director for an overwrought movie like this. For goshsakes, he directed ""Showgirls!""Michael Douglas is also perfect for this, since he's as melodramatic an actor as his father, Kirk. Sharon Stone's entire career is based on her pantie-less uncrossing her legs from this movie.There are, of course, supposed to be lots of twists and turns, but none of them are surprising. Kind of defeats the purpose of having twists and turns!The redeeming feature is Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, giving the movie a LOT more class that it deserves! Jan de Bont's cinematography is very good, as well.This movie is for anyone who wants trashy thrillers, with less sex than you usually see on Cinemax!****** (6 Out of 10 Stars)",Basic Instinct
140,refinedsugar,"Silly story, some sizzle",6,17 February 2000,"Basic Instinct at its heart is basically a big-budget T&A flick with a cast straight from the ""A"" list. Although it's directed by Paul Verhoven, a script from Joe Esterhaz (writer of Showgirls) gets downright silly at times and is b-movie routine. 'Detective working on murder case - prime suspect is some drop dead fox - the detective knows she's probably guilty, but proceeds to have sex with her in numerous scenes' that I've seen many times before. Admittably Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are good and the chemistry between them is pretty hot, but in the end the whole thing is underwhelming. The only thing that distinguishes this from any number of Satuday night b-movies is the cast. Tune in for the atmosphere, the tone and for Douglas and Stone because the story is a washout.",Basic Instinct

142,vasco_cid,Sharp as the Ice Pick,10,12 October 2006,"14 years have passed since Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone made the iconic erotic thriller that definitely defined the genre. There is was a lot of controversy when the movie came out regarding how explicit the sex scenes are and the way lesbians are depicted on screen. It is very sure to say that today that controversy isn't gone. What everyone seems to agree is that the great majority of films that become iconic are so either because of their thematic or for the fact that they are ground-breaking in a particular issue. Basic Instinct is definitely this case and rightfully so. It is one of my favourite movies not only because it is on of my favourite genres but also because the movie is stellar in many aspects. Paul Verhoven is a good director and this is a great example of that, the way he shoots the sex scenes is sexier, the way he shoots car chases is memorable and his camera moves only when it should. The screenplay plays games with your mind, the cinematography is top notch, and, of course the main theme is one of the most memorable there are. But over all these praises the reason why the movie is as good as it is, is because of Sharon Stone. She was born to play Catherine Tramell, her wit, her charm, her beauty, her sarcasm are perfect, and I assure no one else could do that, the interrogation scene with the famous leg crossing is a perfect example of that. I think I'm not exaggerating when I say that Catherine Tramell is one of the best and most memorable characters in movie history. Also, I think what makes the movie so good is the total openness of the ending. We are never told exactly who did it, and although many people have their secure theories, the movie is well written enough to accept both theories. But if you want to dispute, you can watch the movie over and over again, which is precisely my case...",Basic Instinct

145,K-Slicer,Why I liked this movie,10,10 April 2002,"This is the best movie to have ever come between 1990 and 1995.  This is the masterwork when it comes to erotic suspense.  I believe it inspired the flood of sexual suspense B-Movies in the 1990's.  Micheal Douglas plays a formerly drug-addicted San Francisco detective who investigates a murder where the killer seems to ""get off"" on bloody murder.  As he investigates, he becomes entangled with a seductress of an author played by Sharon Stone and a seductive police psychologist played Jeanne Tripplehorn.  The trail includes jealousy, betrayal, and loads of rough/wild sex where it inevitably climaxes and goes down to a shocking but seemingly correct resolution. Throw together the excellent direction of Paul Verhoeven, Joe Eszterhas' exceptional, caustic, and biting screenwriting, Jan De Bont's revealing and tantalizing cinematography and the awesome performances of Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and George Dzundza as the detective's partner along with other well-done performances by some of Hollywood's well-known character actors, and you are left with ""Basic Instinct"".  If you take a slight risk and see this movie, you will be in for a wild ride.10 out of 10.  One of my all-time favorite films (#2).",Basic Instinct

Masterful foreshadowing. Fantastic acting, in a way that really jibes with the weird mixing of genre. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding. It's noir, it's erotica, it's a procedural, it's satire, it's high-brow kitsch.No wonder it's a cult classic and people only came to appreciate it much later. Nothing quite like it. I don't think this movie gets made today. Not even close.",Basic Instinct
147,MattHankinson,Sexy and suspenseful.,8,25 July 2020,Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are incredible in this. Unbelievable sex scenes. Cat and mouse. Keeps you guessing right until the end. Still can't make my mind up even when it does finish. Ambiguous. Can see why it's iconic.,Basic Instinct
148,mbhgkmsgg,Basic Instinct,7,18 January 2021,"Bacis Instinct is as grimy and dirty, thrilling and exciting as they come. It weaves a web that twists and turns when you least expect it to and reaches a conclusion both impactful and satisfying. Unfortunately, however, those twists and turns are often quite obvious in nature and thusly lack the desired impact.The thing that I liked perhaps the most was the way it began. These types of films often begin with an introduction to the killer. And while Basic Instinct does that as well, it does so in an atypical fashion. Normally, it's made explicitly clear who the killer is, and the focus of the film is on catching him or her. However, the way it was done here not only added a twist of its own but also kept me on the edge of my seat. The way Basic Instinct introduces the killer is one of mystery. While we are given glimpses of what she looks like, there is never a clear shot of her face. As the movie then proceeds to introduce us to the ensemble of characters, it isn't perfectly clear who the mysterious killer is. It's easy to guess who she is, and indeed it's almost obvious at first, but as the twists and turns start to stack up, the identity of the killer becomes shrouded in a web of uncertainty. This decision to keep the identity as a mystery until the very end added an extra layer to the kind of film that Basic Instinct is. As said, I often feel like others in its genre focus only on the process of capturing the perpetrator. This one, however, made me do a guessing game of my own, and in many ways, it made it easier to fall into the story and mystery.Unfortunately, though, it's not all good. While the film does manage to introduce a level of uncertainty by hiding the killer's identity and creating a twist that could lead some to doubt about said identity, it didn't work for me. I thought it was very obvious from the get-go who the killer was. And it was simply due to the fact that none of the twists, even the most significant ones, felt plausible. Although Basic Instinct relies quite heavily on the plethora of sudden twists and turns, none of them felt particularly impactful. While I didn't perhaps see them coming, once they arrived, they didn't convince me. The film portrays the assumed killer in such a way early on, that I found it impossible to think that it could've been anyone else. Some moments did raise an inkling of doubt, but ultimately, there was no question in my mind about who the person behind the murders was. The result of a lack of impact in many of the most pivotal moments was a film that often felt unnecessarily slow. The story, while seemingly complex, is actually quite straightforward, and I couldn't help but feel that some scenes could've been shorter or even left out. Because of these scenes, Basic Instinct often lost its tempo, which I feel is crucial for these types of films. For me, it's the high pace and thrill of the chase that make them work.That isn't to say that there isn't a lot of great things here as well. Indeed, one of the things I adored the most was the mood and feel of this film. It often felt almost Michael Mann like, with its dark and grimy cityscapes and beat up cops chasing criminals through a game of cat and mouse. The few action scenes that were present were also great. They consisted mostly of fantastically thrilling car chases that felt completely out of place but somehow added just that little bit of something extra to the final product. And then there is, of course, the interrogation scene, which is nothing short of iconic. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I realize that the individual pieces that this film was built from were all great, but for some reason, once they were put together, the resulting product just wasn't as impactful and exciting as it should've been. It's still a good film, and it has a ton of great moments, but as it relies so heavily on the mystery, I felt that it was never mysterious or unpredictable enough.All in all, though, I quite enjoyed Basic Instinct. It certainly offers a fun ride throughout and even a fair bit of tension at times. While I didn't fall into its story of deceit as much as I would've liked to, I thought that there were plenty of things that were fantastic. Indeed, mostly I'm just disappointed, as I felt that this could've easily been even better than it was.",Basic Instinct
149,thespeos,Excellent Blending of Film Types,8,20 June 2021,"As to murder mysteries, this is a good film.As to ""cops n' robbers,"" it's a good film.As to erotica, it's a good film.But what makes this story and film (somewhat) unique is the amalgam of the three (3) types. Well done.STORY:
As mentioned above, this story combines elements of diverse story types and does an excellent job of blending them.This is, frankly, very hard to do without one of the three (3) elements taking over the story. None do, as it's always
about murder, police work, and erotica.ACTING:
The acting as whole is fine, but Stone carries the film. Douglas is just being himself (the usual narcissistic pr!ck),
but Stone steps into and fills out her character with perfection. Aside from being unable to show genuine grief,
her acting here was stellar. Then again, maybe the inability to express genuine grief was ... part of her character.TEMPO:
Excellent pace end-to-end, though the film tends to pivot far too much around Douglas (surprised?).CINEMATOGRAPHY:
For the film's ""type,"" it's just OK. Not great. Not bad. The car chase was unnecessary, and didn't add to the story.DIRECTING:
Neither the director nor the writer have much of a (impressive) resume, but they combined well here.Overall, it's an excellent work that unfortunately is a ""one hit wonder"" for the pair.",Basic Instinct
150,MikeWindgren,Just perfect.,8,13 August 2020,"This is a movie that Hitchcock would have made if his time and age would have allowed it.It has the twists, the camera work (thanks Paul Verhoeven) a director who always got more out of his actors, it shows in this one.There is no need to talk about the interrogation scene, well known. And still sensual.The action is on point, story is perfect.In fact, this is a classic thriller. Don't miss it.",Basic Instinct
151,MovieLuvaMatt,A first-class erotic thriller,8,26 June 2003,"Contrary to popular belief, I feel Paul Verhoeven is a fine director.  Sure, he tends to go the whole nine yards when it comes to sex and violence, but what do you expect?  He comes from Europe!  Not only that, but he comes from Amsterdam!  ""Boundaries"" is like a gibberish phrase in that country.  At least you have to admire the guy for being daring.  I know eroticism can be communicated well without excessive nudity and graphic detail.  Blah, blah, blah.  However, at other times graphic sex scenes can be erotic, and that was the case with ""Basic Instinct.""  And the sex scenes served a purpose. They weren't just there to get a quick rise from the audience. 
Michael Douglas is always fun to watch, constantly gracing the screen with his super-suave demeanor.  Watching this film, I was reminded of how dead sexy Sharon Stone really is.  Recently, she's kept out of the limelight, so I haven't gotten the chance to see too much of her.  Boy, does she have a smokin' body!!  And I don't think anyone could've played this femme fatale role with the same finesse.  I thought of her portrayal of Catherine Tremell as an homage to the classic film noirs, and the sharp dialogue (composed mostly of slick one-liners) pays homage as well.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is delightful to look at too, in her first feature film role.  She has quite a challenging role, and pulls it off amazingly well.  I even enjoyed George Dzunda as Douglas' partner/best friend.  This has to be his best role, as he provides great comic relief and likability.  Joe Esterhas wrote a terrific script that kept me guessing at every turn, building up tension with every scene.  Verhoeven did an amazing job at directing, pacing the film perfectly and throwing in some nifty Hitchcockian elements into the mix.  And who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's score?  It's so unique and sets the tone perfectly.  If I heard the score without watching the movie, I'd know immediately that it's from ""Basic Instinct,"" because it's so original.  When a movie generates this much controversy and buzz, there's bound to be people who take pride in bashing it to death.  I'm not going to jump on that bandwagon, because I honestly think it's a wonderful film.  Those who haven't seen it must check it out!  My score:  8 (out of 10)",Basic Instinct
152,Chuck-149,Michael Douglas is the luckiest guy.,10,10 January 2000,"""Basic Instinct""'s biggest problem is the way it was criticized by the critics.  Everybody thinks it's just some dumb sex thriller in which Sharon Stone has sex with Michael Douglas.  Yes, there is a lot of sex in this movie but, that's not all there is to it.  There is a good murder mystery at the same time.  People are very prejudice when they haven't even seen it. Well maybe you should let go of your prejudice and give ""Basic Instinct"" a try.  The movie starts off fast.  A famous retired rock-and-roll star called Johnny Boz is murdered and the principal suspect is his girlfriend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone).  The detective investigating this case is Nick Curren (Michael Douglas) and his sidekick and at the same time best friend Gus (George Dzundza).  Along the way, the two detectives discover a lot about Catherine and her past.  For one thing, she inherited 110 million dollars when her parents were killed in a boating ""accident"".  She is also a writer and appeared to have written a book about a retired rock-and-roll star who gets murdered by his girlfriend and is writing another one about a detective getting killed by his girlfriend and Douglas is the main character for this book.  There is much more to the movie than what I have written in this summary but I figured that if you were going to watch the movie you wouldn't want to know too much.  Michael Douglas gives a strong performance and Sharon Stone dominates the screen with dangerously seducing personality.  After watching this, it isn't hard to believe she won those prizes at the Blockbuster entertainment awards for best actress as well as most desirable female of 1992.",Basic Instinct
153,Criticalstaff,An homage to V-neck t-shirts,8,6 July 2020,"For the longest time I never had watched this movie in full, only bits here and there, but I was always impressed with the power of its images.
It is a beautiful neo-noir film. Of course, the film is entirely an homage to the classic 40s-50s Noir films. But interestingly it feels fresh and modern. It can be seen as a deconstruction of the genre but also as a prime example in its own right. Because it uses all the techniques and aesthetic tropes of Noir not as mere references but as tools to tell a story.The story is a rather classic murder mystery. It is classic in the sense where it is rather quaint. There is a murder and the cops investigate. Watching it in 2020, it is refreshing to have a straightforward police inquiry, banal almost. There are no sudden plot-twist, no big revelations, no hidden conspiracies, no gimmicks. It is a rather quaint crime-mystery.The style is predominant but its actors define the movie. Everyone is perfectly cast and great in this. Douglas plays convincingly the washed-out cop who is one-step away from suicide/mid-life crisis, but he plays it with charm and wit. An anti-hero type. His character seems so chill and restrained and then suddenly he erupts into furious rage, then only you see that the grey suits are only the surface of the volcano (as in V-neck).Stone plays the best Femme Fatale ever. She is the devil and she is woman. She is the villain of the movie and you can see that her character enjoys that. She plays with all the other characters; manipulates them, uses their emotions against them. She uses sex as a tool. She does it with such aplomb, that you want to hate her for it but you can't (prime example: the police interrogation scene). You know she is bad, but you love her for it. Jeanne Tripplehorn is also a crucial part of the film. Her performance clearly a negative of Stone's, she delivers a sort of ambivalent innocence that (almost) sells you on the mystery bait and switch.I do not see any issues with this movie. It is rather violent, but I was more affected by the psychological violence of Catherine mind-games than by the graphic violence. Of course, now this type of sex and violence are ubiquitous, and for the longest time this movie was the sexiest ever. Again looking for the future I am glad that the more controversial parts of the movie are now quaint, because it allows to focus on the plot/characters/themes.The movie is obviously an homage to Alfred Hitchcock. Vertigo especially: it takes place in SF, all the scenes at Nick's apartment, the blond woman etc... I have to admit that it is very satisfying that not the only the style is repeated but also the themes and the tone. It is as if Hitchcock made a movie in the 90s, which would be the last great erotic thriller.",Basic Instinct
154,CalDexter,"Silly, enjoyable thriller with loads of stupid porno sex",5,4 December 2006,"I was 16 years old when i first saw Basic Instinct in 1992. For a mainstream Hollywood film its sex scenes were really explicit and shocking. Now its rather tame compared to the other violent and sex mad movies which have surfaced in the last 14 years.Some of the film is still entertaining, but i just found Michael Dougla's Nick Curran a pain in the ass imbecile who lets Sharon Stone's Catherine Trammell wind him up big time. And the nightclub scene is one of the best laughs in the movie. Dougla's V neck sweater is a fashion disaster and the way he pulls Stone towards him while they are dancing would make any other woman break his jaw.Still its enjoyable mindless rubbish that does not get better with each viewing.",Basic Instinct

156,KillerLord,"A ""Tightly Done"" Movie!",8,5 October 2008,"I saw this movie years and years after it was released. I happened to hear about it from some friends and yet chose to ignore it because most of the times they were more interested in describing its sexual content rather than the story. The story about Sharon Stone's controversial scene in the movie made it sound like the movie was more of an erotic movie without a story and a plot. This delayed the movie but finally I decided to see it for myself. And I was taken by surprise, the movie is surprisingly interesting and captivating. The movie is about a cop played by Michael Douglas who has been recently cleared of charges of shooting out at two people and is under strict watch for drug and alcohol use. Starring opposite him is Sharon Stone, who plays the role of Catherine, an author with a major in psychology, who is suspected of carrying out the murder being investigated exactly as she herself has described in her own novel. The murder takes place post sex with the victim and hence the movie is full of erotic scenes. Parents should be careful in keeping their children away from this one until they are old enough to comprehend it. The movie has a very tight screen play until it gets a little out of control in the end. The movie essentially starts out with Catherine almost laying her cards open. Her body language and her choice of words clearly reveals one message - ""I killed the man but there is no way in hell you are going to prove it."" The ending of the movie does not seem to harmonize with the starting of the movie. I shall not bother to reveal the end of the movie. But let me tell you that it is not the ideal way to end the movie. Catherine plays the ideal mind game with Nick (Douglas) and Nick is taking up the challenge. The plot thickens! The intelligence of both characters is revealed. You are at the edge of your seats, not because of the bedroom scenes but because you want to hear each and every dialog that can offer clues as to what is happening and what is going to happen. And the end of the movie, you might enjoy your experience or you might not enjoy it. To be honest, I did not find the end so good, definitely not as intelligent as the rest of the movie. Overall, this movie is not bad. It deserves a watch especially by those who like ""Who's done this?"" kind of movies. Whether you cherish the experience is purely dependent on your mode of thought and your expectation from the movie as it develops scene by scene. But I'd advice you to ignore the reputation of the movie as a cheap erotic one. It is an intelligently done movie with decent acting from all cast members.",Basic Instinct
157,padiyark,Waste of patience and money,1,1 September 2011,"Come on all! I really don't get it what all the great reviews are about! This was a horrible film, and I like Verhoeven! If you want a better take on this film, see ""The Fourth Man"", Verhoeven's earlier film with many of the similar elements, but creepier, gorier, and (darkly) funnier. Watching this film was pure torture, from watching Sharon Stone perform ""necrophilia"" (on Douglas), to Douglas' saggy bottom, to some stereotypical ""gotcha""'s. As for performance, Sharon Stone was decent, but Oscar-worthy? No way! Michael Douglas gave his same middle aged, sex-driven role he has done in other films. Jeanne Tripplehorn was also good as an actress, but wasted as it appeared the director had a hard time deciding what to do with her. As for the no-panty scene, just over-rated; this may have been big in the 90s, but with paparazzi getting these same shots out of current starlets, this is no big deal; it wasn't like there was this big vessel of awe in there--many other European movies have shown the same thing.

158,Juan_from_Bogota,Who killed him?,8,28 April 2007,"A remarkable and thrilling experience i had trough this good movie; i felt like on a Hitchkook film, but in a more actual scenario. The story kept me tied all the time, the acting performances where captivating and the sensuality and erotic scenes of the film complement it well. But definitely, what i did like most, was an incredible intelligent script that kept me frozen trough all the film. Is amazing how anyone can make an excellent film around the common and very used subject: Who killed him?. Well this is an example of how a movie can be unoriginal on its basis but still become a good and ""original"" film; is a pleasure for the ones that like thrillers, and this one puts an erotic additional touch that make the movie even better. I liked the acting performances too much. Douglas plays an insecure, somehow innocent, decided but not very intelligent cop with some shadows in his past. Great!, Stone plays one of the greatest cold, manipulative, intelligent characters that i have seen so far!.About the Movie: Michael Douglas plays here the role of detective Nick Curran, a police officer that has been assigned to a case where a former rock star, Johnny Boz is found murdered on his bed, naked and tied. Nick, with his mate Gus (Goerge Dzundza) traces the main suspect of the murder, the beautiful writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), girlfriend of the star, who almost a year before described on a book an exact type of murder. Nick get involved too much in this case, and particularly in Catherine's way of living! that has a particular like for sex with men and women. Nick also faces shadows of his past, some of them are the reasons why some people call him ""shooter"", and he is rehabilitating also from alcohol and drug problems of his past, his former girlfriend and actual therapist Dr. Beth Gardner (Jeanne Tripplehorn), help him trough this rehabilitating process. In the story, Catherine writes also her new thrilling book. All this story where a lot of people is related and to find finally the one who really did it!8/10! and one thumb up for Verhoven!",Basic Instinct
159,ichabod81,Stylish and very intelligent.,8,15 July 2003,"Basic Instinct doesn't underestimate the viewer. The film is very intelligent and it seduces with its wits. Or Sharon Stone's tits. No, I'm just kidding. Several things are accomplished very effectively: Jerry Goldsmith's hauntingly beautiful score, Verhoeven's on-the-moment direction, De Bont's brilliant photography and great performances by the cast (but especially by the leading pair). The scene at the police station is a classic. Of course it has been spoofed over and over again, but the fact remains that it truly is a gripping scene. The police are questioning Tramell, but she turns the tables and manages to grill the detectives literally to sweat. I don't understand why so many people think this movie is out-dated. I don't think so. In fact, I like this movie so much that I know it will remain as good for a long time.**** / *****",Basic Instinct
160,ranblackman,A sensual panting game of passion and nail biting suspense.,8,14 May 2019,"Micheal Douglas and Sharon Stone make this movie. Their complex love story is genuinely interesting and twisted. It fills this movie with beats of tension and investigative antique, then gives it a passion filled, sexual passionate aroma and pays worth that in spades. Throughout the murder mystery, you know Douglas Nick is a flawed character, you know he is obsessively determined, and has a certain liking for odd sexual kinks, as does his killer. That's where interest comes from, that is where it makes itself presented as one dark, depraved, and fully sexual story of primitive passion. The sex scenes are very graphic, almost violent in their quality. It is not here what it usually is. It is not pointless objectification. It has a meaning to their relationship, our two leads. The ending caps this off in a beautifully haunting way. This, in the end, is simply one of those movies that are fun to think about.",Basic Instinct

Trust me, you have to watch it more than once after seeing it. This is one of my favourite suspense thrillers and really draws you in and gets you involved with the murder mystery plot which features several clever twists.Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone give great performances as the leads but the supporting cast including George Dzunda and Jeanne Tripplehorn also does a fine job and have significant roles in the story. I don't want to get into the plot too much as its quite thick and heavily detailed, but it basically starts off with a rock star getting stabbed too death with an icepick, but soon goes further with many other elements and sub-plots involved that relate to the murder and the suspect who Stone plays.This film is very well-made particularly thanks Joe Esztherhas' terrfic suspenseful screenplay and flashy Direction by Paul Verhoeven. However there's also good Cinematography from Jan De Bont and some wonderfully creepy music by Jerry Goldsmith. Although its two hours long it moves at jus the right pace to keep you hooked.This movie is a classic and the ending will either shock you or it won't but you'll certainly want to watch it again and it'll leave you thinking after the credits.10/10 Give it a watch!",Basic Instinct
164,eti55,Soft Porn Passed Off as a Whodunnit,6,24 April 2021,"Nothing against soft core porn, but that's what this movie is. The plot, such as it is, is an excuse for the sex scenes, of which there are many.Said plot involves Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), a San Francisco police detective with a borderline personality and a history of substance abuse problems. Curran is on probation and mandatory psychiatric observation after having been involved in a questionable shooting. He's been assigned to a bizarre murder case involving a retired rock star who was brutally stabbed to death with an ice pick while engaging in carnal activities (the scene where this occurs is graphic. We don't see the murderer's face, but we do see her generously displayed body, and the fact that she's a blonde).The prime suspect is Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), an author whose stories have a strange way of coming true (the murder in the beginning of the movie followed one of her books verbatim). She has a background in psychology and is very bright and manipulative. She toys with Nick's mind from the moment he meets her. Curran knows she's playing with his head, yet even though she's the main suspect in the murder, he's attracted to Catherine..an attraction which crosses the line into obsession. You get the idea that at least part of that obsession is with the danger itself. Another angle to the story, which angered a number of gay activist groups, is that Catherine is bisexual.Meanwhile, Nick has been having an affair with Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn), the police psychologist assigned to him after the aforementioned shooting. It turns out that there's more to Beth's story. We find that out Beth has a history with Catherine..and might also be messing with Nick's head. Jeanne Tripplehorn is my favorite part of the movie. She is SMOKING hot in this. Sharon Stone has nothing on her.Between the sex scenes, mind games and brutal killings there isn't that much time for the actual plot. The movie does keep you guessing as to who the murderer is until the very end. Problem is that the ending is completely arbitrary. There's no real explanation given. It's just boom, here it is. Unfortunately it's not the first time that writer Joe Eszterhas has taken the lazy way out. He did the same with Jagged Edge, toying with the viewer before just saying at the end that person X did it (though Jagged Edge was a much better film).Alas, what could have been a great thriller too often just settles for cheap thrills. Again, nothing against cheap thrills, but they prevent Basic Instinct from being the truly great film noir it had the potential of being.",Basic Instinct

While there are a few lacking moments, such as when officer Nilson is killed by a .38 revolver and det. Curran is suspected and his gun is checked (a .40 caliber automatic), I cried foul. However, I cried murderer at the screen when I thought I'd figured it out, and I was wrong too.A well crafted, well paced, sensuous story from beginning to end, Basic Instinct is that mysterious, sultry woman from across the club. Don't cross her though, or you might end up in her next book.",Basic Instinct
166,SanFernandoCurt,Leave it to beaver!!!,1,5 June 2005,"Oooo-eee. No thumbs up, but we gotta wave a big stinky finger at this one: Without question, it is one of the funniest movies of the 1990s.You can pretty much boil it down to the legendary ""Guy Who's Never Seen a Pussy Before"" scene with Michael Douglas. Cutting to the chase: He deserved an Oscar for that scene alone. Acting, schmacting. He sweats, he palpitates, he looks like he's just about to jump out of his skin! I know what you're thinking: Michael Douglas frequently looks like he's about to jump out of his skin. But in this one, he tops it all by quivering moistly!!! (There's quite a bit of that in this movie.)And kudos must go to the director. You think of the giants - Hawks, Hitchcock, Truffaut - who attempted ""Guy Who's Never Seen a Pussy Before"" scenes. Well, compared to ""Basis Instinct,"" they all fell short. Nosirree, it took a true-born HACK like Paul Verhoeven to give it the glistening meatiness and pinkish texture it deserves.Folks... this isn't some throwaway Brillo patch.

167,filmbuff-05706,An Erotic Thriller That Lives Up To Its Genre Title.,10,20 May 2021,"I first saw Basic Instinct back in July, 10 months ago. I watched the Unrated cut today and I enjoyed it even more. Basic Instinct by genre is an erotic thriller, and it highly suceeds on both ends- it is extremely erotic and very thrilling.The plot centers on Michael Douglas as a police detective named Nick Curran. A new case has begun. The crime? A woman had sex and brutally stabbed her partner with an ice pick. Interestingly enough, a sex-thirsty author named Catherine Tramell(played by Sharon Stone) has just published a book which describes that same exact crime. Did she do it or is there a copycat killer?Catherine claims innocence, but if she didn't do it, then who did? That's what Nick must find out, with Catherine's help. And as they develop the case, they develop a very sexual relationship on the side.That's the plot at it's core. There's other layers to it, but let's not complicate things or give too much away.What I like best about Basic Instinct is how engaging it is. From the first scene, the movie grabs me and keeps me interested and questioning until the end. The pace never seems to slow down and time seems to not exist as I watch. Movies are meant to entertain, and this movie greatly succeeds in that area.It can get a little complicated, but just focus on the lines, rewind if necessary, and do your best to pay attention. Multiple viewings help as well, something Basic Insticnt deserves.As a result of the mystery and suspense, Basic Instinct is very thrilling. For example, Catherine doesn't admit to the murder, but she uses an ice pick often to chip ice for her alcoholic beverages, something the camera focuses on. Does that mean she lied? (She takes a lie detector test early in the movie and passes, but tells Nick on the way home that it's easy to get around lie detectors.)Basic Instinct is of course known for how erotic it is throughout the movie, even more so in the unrated version, the one I just watched. I generally don't care too much for nudity in movies, since they don't seem to do much for the story and I believe as a general rule that private parts should remain private and not displayed on a screen.However, since the genre of this movie depends on such scenes, it seems rather hypocritical to criticize a movie of this nature for that. Criticizing an erotic thriller for being erotic is like criticizing a musical for having singing.And, as embarrassing as it is to admit this, for lack of a better phrasing, Basic Instinct offers some good sensual moments. If you don't like nudity under any circumstance, this is NOT the movie for you. But if you will allow for it, prepare to be very aroused. (The scenes actually got me very hot and sweaty too, I should note.)And, while on the topic of the erotic scenes, there is a debated scene that I would like to add my 2 cents to. In the most infamous scene, Catherine is being interrogated by the police with her legs crossed. Before she goes with the police, she changes her clothes and takes off her underwear, and at one point, she switches her legs, showing what she has underneath to the policemen.It is debated, believe it or not, whether or not we can see her um...femimine stuff. When I saw the R Rated version, I decided only her pubic hair was visible. When I saw the unrated cut today, I concluded that more than that can be seen. This may be a result of the different cuts(which differ in length by a single minute), but that will always be up for debate I bet.The ending is also very mind-blowing, more specifically, the last shot. I will not spoil it, of course, but I have watched the movie twice and both times it had me re-evaluating the entire movie. Film critic Roger Ebert actually gave the movie a negative review because he felt that this shot was a cheat, but I highly disagree. The end is one of the most genius conclusions I have seen in a film.So even though high sexual content isn't really my thing, Basic Instinct is still an effective thriller with great mystery, suspense, action, and yes, even great erotica. Is it a materpiece? Maybe not by definition, but it is what it is and succeeds as a result. For anyone who wants a thrilling mystery and can handle the sex, Basic Instinct is highly recommended.Note: As you can see, I have not written a review since January. I apologize for this, but I tried uploading a few and they wouldn't, plus I have been busy with other things so I haven't been able to write new ones. I do intend to write more, but I may not do it as frequently.",Basic Instinct
168,helencmm,A powerful erotic thriller,8,17 March 2020,"""Basic Instinct"" is a classic erotic thriller, which I enjoyed very much. It has a very catchy plot and a strong cast. I think if other actors would involve it would look really cheap and I think its IMDb rating would be around 4 or 4.5. Luckily, though, it was the right choice of actors since Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are masters of the subgenre (erotic thriller).This film has many things that made it enjoyable to watch. In addition to the above (strong cast, catchy plot), it contains violent and particularly gruesome, bloody kills, in an original way and an original weapon. We have not seen the icepick as a murder weapon in many films. Especially as the mark of the killer. There are many erotic scenes that some might enjoy. Personally I would prefer it to be a little less, but when I decided to watch the film, I knew what I was going to see, so I didn't consider it so bad, but if somebody feels uncomfortable with such things, then this movie is not for this person, because it offers a huge amount of nudity.The plot is as catchy as I mentioned, but definitely not more than that. Theoretically, It's not such a special film, just because this particular genre (erotic thriller) blossomed in the 80's and started disappearing in the early 90's, they weren't released so many erotic thrillers, so it was not difficult for ""Basic Instinct"" to stand out, since out of all this range, this one is without a doubt one of the best of its kind. After all, it's no coincidence that the scene with the Sharon Stone cross legs became legendary.This film is for sure inspired by Italian gialli. The photography is very beautiful and the direction is meticulous. The score is also nice, not only for the film, but also for its time. This movie has a strong 80's aura. Very intense. This may be a negative element for some, as they may not consider it as timeless, but I believe the exact opposite. I find it to be of its era, from the score to the hairstyle and clothing of the actors, but equally timeless. I personally like its aura.The main negative to me, is that there was no twist. Personally, at least, it was obvious from the beginning who the killer was and that all the rest were just red herrings for the viewer. It was all premeditated by the killer, who was a genius I can tell. I would like the protagonist (Nick Curran) to be a little more dynamic and independent and not so ""easy"".Overall I liked the movie a lot. Of course there are flaws, but we are talking about a very good job, especially for this subgenre, because they tend to exploit many things, but the particular one ""exploits"" in a seductive way and has an interesting plot. It doesn't rely solely on the nudity, though the bad thing is that the erotic scenes are the ones that will stand out and not the plot. Still, I recommend it for lovers of this genre!",Basic Instinct

Michael Douglas is the cop who is sent to investigate, and falls for Tramell and they begin a steamy love affair.Basic Instinct definitely does not leave alot to the imagination when it comes to its graphic sex and murder scenes. Stone and Douglas have incredible chemistry and sexual tension between them. Probably the best chemistry I have seen between two couples in a movie. Even in the scenes where they are not having sex, you can sense a strong attraction between them. Some of the plot may be predictable, but the movie has a great pace to it and never gives up.

172,Nolamoviedude,Crotch shot heard 'round the world,4,15 February 2019,"Basic Instinct is the erotic drama that made Sharon Stone a star. The movie opens with a very erotic sex scene that soon turns into a gruesome murder of the male lover with an ice pick while in the throws of passion. Enter Michael Douglas (Nick) as the lead homicide detective who's dealing with his own internal affairs issues for a shooting.Stone plays Catherine Tramell a romance/thriller author who's latest novel is about a rock star getting killed by her lover while tied up with a white scarf with an ice pick. Stone was dating the guy who was killed and he just so happens to be a washed up rock star. The cops take her in for questioning and there are like 6 policemen in the interview room including Newman from Seinfeld. This is the infamous scene where Catherine uncrosses her legs revealing that she doesn't have on underwear. It was a huge deal in 1992 but it's not nearly as vulgar as I remembered it being.Nick's former girlfriend plays the police psychologist who he's forced to see due to his involvement in a shooting. Catherine gets him all worked up so he has really rough sex with his ex girlfriend. The movie kind of dies from here until Nick and Catherine finally hook up. It's soon revealed that his ex and Catherine had a lesbian affair back in college. Catherine gets in Nick's head about his ex being a crazy stalker. In some crazy convoluted ordeal, Nick's partner gets stabbed by an ice pick. We don't see the killer but Nick's ex shows up and Nick shoots her thinking she's the killer. He goes straight to see Stone and they have sex because that's what one does when one kills a former lover?

175,gorgonite,Hitchcock for the 90's,10,5 April 2010,"Basic Instinct was notorious upon release due to a combination of it's graphic sex scenes, along with an infamous close up shot of Sharon Stone.The film is an entertaining thriller with plenty of suspense. For a Hollywood film it seemed to break some barriers in terms of the portrayal of it's sexual content. Together this makes a film that wouldn't be out of place had it been directed by Hitchcock. In fact Verhoeven purposely included touches from Hitchcock's Vertigo!Michael Douglas plays Nick 'Shooter' Curran, a cigarette smoking, liquor drinking, cocaine sniffing cop who has accidentally killed 2 members of the public on duty. This incident was duly covered up.Stone plays Catherine Tramell, a blunt, seemingly care free, book author whose current 'buddy' has been murdered whilst participating in a crazed sexual orgy. Shooter proceeds to investigate the case and keeps biting at bait thrown down to him by Tramell.Upon release I watched this film twice at the cinema as it's visuals, musical score, plot and overall thrills were enthralling. 18 years onward the film has morphed into a clever comedy thriller!Stone's acting at the beginning of the film seems to portray Tramell as some sort of souless replicant/robot. This along with several odd one liners were funny. Also the sex scene involving Douglas and Tripplehorn was hilarious. Even one of Las Vegas's finest actors would probably struggle to find the target as accurately as Shooter's exocet missile!Basic Instinct's plot is deliberately ambiguous leaving it up to the audience to draw their conclusions. This coupled with an implausible plot has drawn much criticism for the film. However it is certainly no documentary and the plot encourages several alternate scenarios which made an enjoyable viewing for the film in 2010.Pros - Sexy suspense thrillerCons - Characters not really very likableOverall - The Sex Bomb******************************************************* ******************************************************Here's my take on who was responsible for the murders in the movie.Garner's death by Shooter is an accident. Clearly Tramell set up the situation as Shooter had been shown the latest printout from the book. As this printout was yet to be published, a likely scenario would have been to subsequently destroy it with the intention of messing with Shooter's head.Garner was still at the scene after the last murder had taken place meaning that the chances of being caught were high! Therefore it could be concluded that Tramell did the murder, leaving Garner at the scene with a highly implausible alibi. Also Tramell had arranged for further evidence to be planted in Garner's apartment. Had Garner committed the crimes, she surely would not have dumped the gun behind a cupboard in her unlocked apartment!The murder of Garner's husband could have been arranged by Tramell. Subsequently either Garner killed the rock star at the beginning to implicate Tramell, or more likely Tramell was high on cocaine and enacted her book.Nielsen must have interviewed Tramell whilst investigating the murder of Garner's husband. Tramell may have arranged for Nielsen to be paid off to halt any further investigations, whilst simultaneously providing information for her new book. After Shooter alerted Garner that Tramell was aware of his file, Tramell arranged for Nielsen to be shot dead to mess with Shooter's head.",Basic Instinct
176,willwoodmill,Generic 90's crime thriller,5,19 April 2016,"Basic Instinct is a mystery crime thriller directed by the famous action film director Paul Verhoeven. The film is about the murder of a famous rockstar and the subsequent investigation by detective Nick Curran, (played by Michael Douglas) a former alcoholic who has a complicated relationship with his therapist. Curran and his partner Gus start by interrogating the last person he was seen with, and that person is Catherine Tramell. (played by Sharron Stone.) A multimillionaire, who has a degree in sociology, and writes murder novels on the side. And as it turns out she wrote a book a year early about a rockstar who gets murdered in exactly the same way. Naturally she becomes the prime suspect. As the police keep digging they find several dirty secrets from her past, and at the same time Curran begins to ""fall in love"" with Tramell. Basic Instinct can be described as, ""generic crime thriller."" The odds are you've already seen everything Basic Instinct has to offer. But just because it's unoriginal doesn't mean that it's bad, unoriginal movies can still be fun, and Basic Instinct luckily has some pretty fun parts. The plot, while generic, is serviceable for the type of film Basic Instinct is, but it's nothing special. And towards the end of the film they take so many twists and turns that it made just sort of stop caring, because I just assumed that every piece of information the film was giving me was wrong, and was gonna be proved wrong in the next 2 minutes. So I decided to just wait for the big reveal at the end of the film. Which had so many fake outs that I started to get really annoyed.Douglas is pretty good in his role, nothing amazing, but it seems like he put effort into it. And Sharon Stone is great as the seductive temptress Tramell. But some of the other actors were questionable, especially George Dzundza, who plays Nick's partner Gus in the film. A lot of Gus's lines are so awkward and stupid that you can't tell if your supposed to take the film seriously, for example ""that magna cum laude pussy is screwing with your brain, Nick."" And not only are there really stupid lines, there are also really stupid scenes, the dumbest of which is an incredibly out of place car chase that comes out of nowhere. Maybe that's just Paul Verhoeven being Paul Verhoeven, but god it did not fit at all with the rest of the film at all and just destroyed the films tone. Oh and as long as we're still on the subject of stupidity, let me just say that Basic Instinct does not know what the word 'alibi' means a pretty big issue considering its a crime film. Then again most Paul Verhoeven films are kinda stupid, but unlike some of his other films Basic Instinct doesn't have the excuse of being a satire to hide behind.You get exactly what you'd expect from Basic Instinct, a fun, even if it's a little dumb, simple crime thriller. If you're looking for something frightening or challenging I'd recommend something else, but if your just looking for a little dumb fun you can do a lot worse than Basic Instinct. And if your into crime-thrillers you'll probably get a kick from Basic Instinct. 5.4/10",Basic Instinct

178,EdwardCarter,What about the DNA???,1,6 November 2013,"The DNA database has existed for criminal investigations since 1984, and DNA evidence alone was used to jail Colin Pitchfork for murder in 1988. This film was set in 1992, the year of its release, and completely ignores DNA. If Catherine had really killed Johnny Boz while they were having sex then her DNA would have been all over the bed. Since she was the last person seen with Boz before he was murdered, the police would have simply got the court to demand her DNA sample. If she had refused, then she would have been arrested and charged with obstruction of justice. DNA would have proved that Catherine was with Boz at the time of his death.This is just an overlong, badly written, trashily risible porn movie with Michael Douglas far too old to play Nick and Sharon Stone displaying plenty of skin but no acting ability. It's hardly surprising that her career did not take off after this, with ""Total Recall"" being her only other hit. Stone never was an actress and she only became famous in her mid-30s by revealing her silicone implants and shaved crotch for the whole world to see. Aside from the terrible acting, vile dialogue and boring car chases this is just a stupid film with nothing to recommend it. Nobody would have gone to see it at all without the exploitive sex scenes.Douglas was clearly too old and ugly for a film like this. It is too far-fetched that a multi-millionairess would have fallen for a heavily-lined, 50-year-old chain smoking alcoholic drug addict. His sagging buttocks are simply too funny. Wearing tight jeans was a big mistake as his sagging behind is still very noticeable. A younger actor should have been cast as Nick.A film like this would never be made now because the Internet has killed off sex and nudity in films. With so much real sex available for free online people don't need to pay to watch simulated sex in movies. ""Showgirls"", an even worse film, flopped at the cinema partly because porn was widely available on video by the mid-1990s.SPOILER: Perhaps if they wanted a mystery they should not have used Sharon Stone in the opening sequence?0/10.",Basic Instinct

Gay groups protested this because it portrayed lesbians as diabolically evil, but every other character in the film is equally ""offensive"".  The characters played by Michael Douglas and George Zsundza aren't exactly model cops.  When I first saw the film on the day it opened, I knew that Sharon Stone would become a star.  She commands every scene she's in, not just the interrogation scene or the sex scenes. Joe Eszterhas' screenplay keeps your interest throughout.  It's not very credible, to be sure, but it keeps you guessing, and the characters aren't stupid like they were in JAGGED EDGE and JADE.

180,Chris-999,Not Bad Sex Thriller.,7,11 August 2000,"Michael Douglas turns in his usual ""Regular guy meets sexy woman has sex with her a few times and terrible things start to happen"" role, but Sharon Stone makes a steamy breakthrough performance as Catherine Tramell. She is the prime suspect of killing her Rock-Star boyfriend with an ice pick the same way as she wrote in her latest novel. They question her(I think we all know what happens there), she takes a lie detector test, she passes. But now she's writing another novel about a detective who falls in love with a woman and she kills him. And  as he starts to find out more about her past and she starts to find out about his past , he gradually falls for  her(Who Wouldn't!). Then more murders mount up and he is determined to find out if she did it or not. Highly erotic,but still a pretty good thriller. Enough violence.

182,grahamcarter-1,The Fourth Man,9,14 May 2017,"Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992) is Euro Trash schlock in many ways, but because it has an enormous budget, and an at the time big star in Michael Douglas, it was able to be mass marketed to the hordes and became a very big hit indeed. In order to sell this lurid tale to the U.S some obvious changes were made from Verhoeven's earlier 'The Fourth Man', such as losing the cocks and adding more breasts, and removing the homosexual men and adding lesbians.The film centers on police detective Nick Curran, who is investigating the brutal murder of an ex- rock star. During the investigation Curran becomes involved in an intense relationship with the prime suspect; the beautiful and mysterious Catherine Tramell. Ex-smoker, ex-alcoholic (and ex-coked up) Curran is nicknamed 'Shooter' as he accidentally killed two tourists, an act that achieved him notoriety as well as headlines. Forced to undergo psychological evaluation, he sleeps with his therapist Dr Beth Garner. In regards Dr Beth, Curren's partner Gus states; ""Boy when that girl mates, it's for life."" Gus gets to voice other points of insight such as ""She's got that magna cum laude pussy on her that done fried up your brain,"" although there he refers to Catherine, and not Beth.As in 'The Fourth Man' (and Dario Argento's 'Tenebre'), Catherine is a pulp fiction writer whose work causes people to die under circumstances similar to her narratives. She knows all about Curran, keeping press clippings on his notorious shooting and subsequent investigation. Worryingly for Curran, all of her prototypes for previous novels have ended up dead. Also, she is planning on writing a novel titled 'Shooter,' a story about ""a cop who falls for the wrong girl."" As in 'The Fourth Man', this both excites and frightens Curran. Verhoeven altered his stylish 'Giallo' look of 'The Fourth Man' to the slicker, glassier, blue tinted more metallic look of a Hollywood thriller. Some shots, such as when Curran voyeuristic-ally watches Catherine undress, remind one of Brian DePalma's 'Body Double'.The opening scene explicitly links sex and violence, as a woman, possibly in a blonde wig, ice picks her lover to death at the point of orgasm, a very 'Giallo' death indeed. Argento like tropes such as doppelgangers are employed, as when Curran's interrogation mirrors Catherine's. To add to the mix Curran also has an alibi that matches Catherine's; ""Would I storm into a guy's office in front of everybody in the middle of the day and kill him that night?"" However, Curran is put on enforced leave and in the Argento tradition becomes an outsider who has to perform his own investigation. As a result of Catherine, he is seeing and not seeing.Argento colour schemes are employed, with the film having a predominately cold blue look, that changes to hues of red as danger starts to creep in. At the films first possible conclusion we get what adds up to a classic Argento set piece. Gus is in danger. We know he is in danger as he is entering the building alone, and the colour scheme has morphed to red hues. About to exit the elevator a black cloaked and hooded figure performs a frenzied ice pick attack on the unsuspecting victim. The elevator setting reminds one of Argento's 'Deep Red' and Brian DePalma's 'Dressed To Kill'. Like the best of Argento, anyone could be guilty, and in many ways everybody 'is' equally guilty. Argento 'alternate killer theory' may have been on the writers mind in the concluding scene Curran and Catherine 'fuck like minks,' and the camera lowers to under the bed revealing an ice pick. Was Betty framed? Or is looking for logic just silly? Probably.",Basic Instinct
183,Clothes-Off,"Pushes the envelope, with no substance to back it up.",5,17 November 2007,"When word came out that one of the highest prices to date was paid for this screenplay, many excellent screenwriters must have been scratching their heads in disbelief. But the studio got a return on its investment, in dollars if not in quality.Kudos to Michael Douglas for accepting a daring part at this stage in his career, but for all he and Sharon Stone give to their roles, the script lets them down, with poorly-developed supporting characters and a very unsatisfying conclusion.Then there's the gay/bisexual angle. This film angered some gay activists because of its negative portrayal of female sexuality. I don't think there was any disrespect intended, but it seemed that way because of the careless handling of the female characters. The character of Roxy, a girlfriend of Stone's character, would have been much more fleshed-out in a better film.So for all the thrill of the sex scenes and the suspense, the viewer is left at the end saying merely, ""Okay, I've seen it."" And that's all I'll say as well. It's worth seeing once if you're curious, but once is more than enough. It does not hold up in repeated viewings.",Basic Instinct

What do I think?Well, some of the scenes are so ridiculous it's hard not to love them, like the car chase near Tramells house- entirely inconceivable and ridiculous but I think Verhoeven knows it. Sure, this film has detractors and for valid reasons- imagine if Hitchcock decided Vertigo needed to be corny, sleazy, sexually charged and violent (which I mean Vertigo didn't need to be any of those things), but Basic Instinct is riotous and ridiculous fun. I need to watch more to say this with complete accuracy but I genuinely feel as if Verhoeven might be one of those directors who cares more about having a good time than making bona fide art and I'm good with that.",Basic Instinct

From the get go, you know Sharon is behind the whole thing, but director Paul Verhoven twists an intricate web that really makes you doubt the obvious. His erotic nature, his crude eye for the sexual really works and puts a stamp on this film like no other has ever been able to do since.Michael Douglas is great but is no eye candy (you'll understand when you see his turkey ass a wibble wobble) but he works as a gritty cop with a previous history that takes the interest of Miss Tremmel.if you want a good thriller for your Saturday night thrills, shot perfectly by Mr. Jan De Bont and a good cast then check out Basic Instinct",Basic Instinct

190,davdecrane,Film noir by way of Europe,8,31 March 2010,"Inaccurately labeled a suspense thriller, BI is really more of a classic film noir. A cop with a tragic flaw (guilt over killing innocent tourists) is exploited by a beautiful woman who is the major suspect in a string of murders. He falls off the wagon in every way, losing his job, reverting to alcohol, cigarettes and anger mis-management. The shadows are every bit as dark in San Francisco and Stinson Beach as they were in the classic noirs of 1950s LA, and the music and mood (and dangerous blondes) purposely conjure up a Hitchcockian milieu. The plot – not just Joe Estzerhas's best but arguably his only really strong showing – is wonderfully complex but always comprehensible; there's no Big Sleep-like descent into total confusion. Michael Douglas is great and the other actors more than capable, with the exception of Sharon Stone. But her contribution is very real because BI trumps its genre (and its cousin, the Hollywood thriller) by exhibiting an unmatched level of eroticism – or just plain, enjoyable prurience. Douglas is seduced by Stone and her charms and so are we, sure of ourselves at first, then casting aside doubts as we play a dangerous game with the most fatale of noir-ish femmes. The movie probably couldn't have been made from a native American's script, or directed by anyone but a European, or acted by any Hollywood ladies except ingénues with reputations to make, not protect.",Basic Instinct

203,moviestar26,Sharon Stone's finest hour,6,26 November 2012,"'Basic Instinct' was a film that rebooted the noir genre after it became rare in the early eighties. Prior to this the Coen brother's 'Blood Simple' attempted to revive the genre, but the industry was changing with the shift in audience's movie preferences. However this is more akin to being a sex thriller which also happens to incorporate a suspense element. 'Basic Instinct' takes the viewer back in time to the golden era of cinema when the femme fatales were glamorising the screen and became every male's dream fantasy. The film has been considered a classic and has not dated with time. The theme has been beautifully been One of my cult classic favourites from the 1990s. Whenever I catch a scene randomly on television, it brings back nostalgic memories of my childhood. I can still remember waking in the middle of the night just so I could record this movie secretly on my VCR. This is the movie that catapulted stone's career to international stardom. She immediately became a sex symbol and every man began dreaming of her. She immortalised a role that was so deep in characterisation. 'Catherine Trammel' was someone that was not only devious but smart, clever and manipulative. A role model so to speak that will certainly serve as an influence to many aspiring actresses and writers in the future. The role possessed every element that a negative character would have. Joe Esterhas is the writer. Previously he wrote 'Flash dance' and 'jagged edge' Most of his themes are similar. All negative roles about killers and murderers. 'Showgirls' and 'Jade' were also adapted for the screen. Unfortunately they failed at the box office and did not work. I think the audiences had higher expectations. 'Basic Instinct' has a fantastic script. This is the reason why the film worked. And then there is Paul Verhoeven who is a well known director in his home land. He has beautifully combined sex with the suspense genre. I am not very familiar with his Dutch movies. But he always had the style of depicting the theme of 'sex' as a weapon. I enjoyed the movie immensely, and being more of a reader than a movie- goer I jumped at the chance to read the book subsequent to seeing the motion picture. However, I feel that much of which made the movie great owes gratitude to the incredible soundtrack, imagery and skill of the actors; sometimes movies can be successfully novelised, but with Basic Instinct being the stimulus-rich move that it is I feel this was a failed attempt. The characters come off as threadbare and unexplored, lacking in depth or substance of any kind, and the seductively dark tone of the movie is lost on the page; it becomes rather humdrum and glancing, as if each page were written to keep up with the flow of the movie to be read within the hour. Where I was hoping to see some of the twisted, genius logic of Catherine Tramell explored on the page instead I found her to be de-powered, humanised and lacking of a great deal of her appeal as a result. It's worth the read for big fans of the Basic Instinct movies if only to explore the idea through a different form of media, (SPOILER) A San Francisco police detective who is investigated the murder of a retired rock star. The main suspect happens to be a novelist. She is under suspicion. She is released due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile the detective has maintains his belief that she is involved. He decides to pursue her and monitor her movements. The deeper his investigation proceeds, he succumbs to her charm and falls in love in spite knowing he is risking his life. His infatuation distances him from people around him and he refuses to listen to others. People he know become murdered. Eventually he finds it difficult to accept that she is a murderer as he begins to doubt his psychiatrist's past. (END OF SPOILER) The film is made with a sexy noir thriller tone. It brings back memories of Lawrence Kasden's 'Body Heat'. This was the last time a lead actress made an impression with a memorable role. Kathleen Turner became a popular star. At many moments the film feels like a horror thriller. There are many scenes that evoke a frightening feeling. What makes 'Basic Instinct' so unique is we are watching a women manipulating us with her attractive appeal that makes us want to believe she can be a killer. Her seductive charm works on the male protagonist, which leads to confusion. At the end we are eager to want to see her apprehended because we are disgusted how someone can desire to get away with murder for no reason. The sex scenes were unique and were the closest that could be categorised as 'soft porn'. This was one of the appealing factors that mad the film a success. 'Basic Instinct' has sustained it's quality over the years. It has managed to preserve it's quality and has not paled in front of movies that released recently. Due credit goes to Sharon Stone's performance and a winning script by Esterhas. The movie does follow true to the noir conventions. Anyone who is familiar with this will be able to notice them. However some of the typical noir rules were missing. There was no themes related to adultery or blackmailing. But it's relevance or lack of it doesn't seem significant as the this was a character driven film.Jerry Goldsmith's background score is specifically suited to the film's mood and atmosphere. It is still memorable and has different shades throughout the movie. It blends well with scenes and evokes the intriguing and haunting feeling.",Basic Instinct
204,Good-Evening-Clarice,"Soars and crashes in violent bursts of emotions, sex and violence",10,4 August 2002,"I'm sure everyone has at least heard of BASIC INSTINCT, the 1992 erotic thriller in which Sharon Stone, a relative unknown, crossed and uncrossed her way to megastardom.

Once it gets going there's no stopping--nonstop curse words, drug use, savage sex scenes, fatal car chase scenes, brutal ice pick slayings, ruthless shootings, lies, deceit, treachery, malice--if the movie stops in the midst of all this, it will crash. So although it steps wrong at times such as with the dialogue (""She uses people, she manipulates people!"") or plot points (Catherine colored her hair like me/no, it was Beth who copied me), it so breezes past these errors that we don't even have time to look back on them. Douglas offers a good performance and really has the lead, but this is all Sharon Stone's show, and she delivers a brazenly sexy performance. Give it a try. I mean, there IS the crossing/uncrossing leg scene, isn't there?PS: I own the secondly released DVD version which contains some 45 seconds originally cut from the film, both from the opening ice pick killing to the big Douglas-Stone sex scene which is a lot more, well, oral than the original version.",Basic Instinct

Jeanne Tripplehorn is pretty good as the psychiatrist, and the rest of the supporting cast are solid as well.However, special mention must go to the character of Catherine Tramell. This character is simply one of the best and most original ever written for a woman. Her wit is quick, her sex appeal is undeniable and her love is fierce. Sharon Stone is amazing in the role. She gives an unflinching portrayal of a strong and independent woman, who uses her incredible intelligence and insatiable sexuality to full advantage.An excellent thriller, made even better by a one-of-a-kind female protagonist.8/10",Basic Instinct

211,moviedude-72,"Not a very realistic premise, but a very entertaining and top-notch thriller.",7,23 April 2007,"What can I honestly say about Basic Instinct that has not already been said? The film opened with an enormous bang in 1992  it was one of the most commercially successful films of the year, and it was surrounded by immense hype. It soon became of the defining films of the '90s, because of the grotesque sexuality and violence it so graphically portrayed. But once you get past that, it's a top-notch, highly entertaining thriller. It combines the stylish aspects of the classic Hitchcock production, Vertigo, a long-time favourite of mine, right from the San Francisco setting, to Sharon Stone wardrobe choices and her calculating, evil and cold persona (a substitute for Kim Novak in Vertigo).Everything about this movie is astounding, it even continues to evoke a ""wow"" factor today, well into the 2000s, and that goes to show much about its audacity and high-risk dares it took on, and subsequently conquered back in the early 1990s. Sure it's not a very realistic premise  but it's an amazing visual and artistic achievement that is pinned firmly into cinema history. It merits a well-deserved status as a modern classic, something you rarely come across today.Stone is marvelous as the sexy, devious and manipulative femme fatal heiress Catherine Tramell, who was unfairly under looked at the Oscars ceremony in 1993. Her presence is amazing; she steals the show from the first scene, right on to the very end, when it is revealed she was the perpetrator of the murders. She resembles one of the great temptresses of neo-noir, back in 1940s and 1950s cinema. Douglas is also at top-notch as the washed up and perhaps a little too vulnerable detective, prone to falling into Catherine's seductive, saucy charms  to her pure intentions. Supporting cast is also wonderful, featuring the screen talents of Jeanne Tripplethorn and George Duzanda among others. The direction by Verhoven (of the equally fantastic science fiction thriller Total Recall) is very inventive  he certainly knows a lot about the Hitchockien intrigue. He has all the plot twist of Hitchock, the visual style, its all there, but the copious sexuality was quite Hitchcock's vice in film.An excellently entertaining, elegantly composed and directed top-notch thriller, however it certainly is not for the faint hearted or immature. I may be a little young to watch it, but I'm mature and understanding when it comes to cinema. You where warned, now see it if you want a dazzling thrill ride.7.8/10",Basic Instinct

Unfortunately, once you get past that, there's not much else here. The plot is so convoluted that even Joe Esterhaz, the guy who wrote it, wasn't sure who the killer was or what happened. The film did make Sharon Stone a star, but did not help her in the long run. Aside from Casino, has she made one good movie since Basic Instinct? In a way, it did for her what Dracula had done for Bela Lugosi 61 years earlier. Yes, the roles made them famous and immortal, but also typecast them leading to careers in generally inferior films. The gay protesters who objected to the film's negative portrayals of lesbians missed the mark. What they should have objected to is that all of the characters are unlikable or unsympathetic.

Still it remains more than decent in its excellent whodunit fashion, its splendidly cast Douglas and, of course, its fortune in having this talented bombshell as its femme fatale. (Truth be said Stone is a bit overtly narcissistic, but all is forgotten when legs are crossed.) Furthermore, 18 years after its first screening, Instinct stands as a fine indicator of how the graphic elements are gradually dated (the sex is still bolder than most you've seen ever since, but back then the hype was relentless) benefiting more essential stuff.

Can't remember what they were? Well, if you guessed ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Basic Instinct,"" then you are 150 percent right.""Basic Instinct"" has a lot in common with ""Fatal Attraction,"" and here are the ingredients. We take one Michael Douglas, a lawyer in ""Fatal"" and a cop in ""Basic,"" the hero or antihero, depending, who makes a very impulsive mistake of falling for the wrong woman and getting into dangerous trouble for that. We add one lethal sexy blonde. For ""Fatal,"" that is Glenn Close, kinky curls and all, and Douglas' mistress who stalks him persistently after wanting to let her go and return to normal family life. For ""Basic,"" that's young Sharon Stone with straight hair in contrast to the older Close's curls, in a starmaking role as the femme fatale who wears no underwear, flashes to Douglas in the interrogation scene, and will do anything to do him in. Then there is a dash of the brown-haired good wife or spouse of Douglas, both who share the name Beth and both of them cheated on by Douglas with the bad blondes . Yes, Anne Archer with curls was Douglas' nice but cheated wife who is willing to protect him and his daughter against Glenn Close in ""Fatal."" In ""Basic,"" young Jeanne Tripplehorn, also with straight hair in contrast to the older Archer's curls, is Beth, not a homemaker, but a police psychologist who has a stint of rough sex with Douglas and is more tense about him than Archer was in ""Fatal"". And for comic relief, Douglas had two rotund best friends and colleagues in both movies; meek Stuart Pankin in a small but funny role in ""Fatal"" as a lawyer who spurts one-liners but cops out in the library scene where Douglas tells him his troubles, mumbling ""It ain't good."", and macho, hilarious George Dzundza in ""Basic"" in a larger part as Douglas' urban cowboy partner who cusses, charges about, looks to nail Stone and it would seem that Dzundza, with both weight and muscle, could easily squish Pankin anytime. But there are no small children or boiled rabbits in ""Basic,"" unlike ""Fatal."" As far as ""Basic"" goes, this movie, as well as ""Fatal,"" goes without controversy. This one has a tougher edge and deals with lesbianism and kinky sex. Stone as Catherine Trammell is a bisexual novelist who is charged with murdering her boyfriend a nightclub owner with a icepick in bed in the throes of passion. Douglas as Nick is assigned to the case, and beds with her of course. All his colleagues are worried about him, including Dzundza as partner Gus and Tripplehorn as Beth, but Nick carries on with the affair and here, unlike in ""Fatal,"" won't let go. Then there are other suspects, such as Catherine's lookalike girlfriend, Roxy, and even Beth herself. Hmmmm, seems tricky now. And the plot thickens then on.""Basic Instinct"" is a very hot movie, with Douglas giving an even harder edge, and if I had to choose between ""Fatal"" and ""Basic,"" I'd think I'd take ""Basic"" anytime, because in ""Fatal"", the characters for Douglas, Archer, and Pankin seemed somewhat mousier than Douglas, Tripplehorn, and Dzunda in ""Basic."" Yes, in ""Basic,"" Douglas toughened up his character as Nick in contrast to lawyer Dan, because although they are both adulterers, Nick takes a walk on the wilder side than Dan has. Yet, Douglas handed the steamy stuff to both Close and Stone as those two hot femme fatales, and Stone, who may have lacked Close's witchy curls, is scarier than Close.",Basic Instinct

He was representative of what we were feeling.Just because you couldn't wrap your head around doesn't mean it didn't make sense and you can obviously choose to ignore the scenes you don't quite like.

219,Cinesnatch,This is the only film with Sharon Stone you ever really need to see.,9,20 May 2003,"King of smut screenwriter Joe Eszterhas gives us his most inspired screenplay, amid most of the garbage he's contributed to film history. A project that is completely aware of how truly awful it is, it still retains high respect for its audience. What we get is some premium, grade-A trash. Paul Verhoeven spares no dollar on his lavish locales and lush score. At the center of the whole production is Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammel, the high-profile paperback novelist who is the main suspect in the murder of a wealthy San Francisco businessman. She quickly reads and hooks the detective on the case (Michael Douglas) into her web of potential danger.So what if the film's views are misogynistic and insists that a woman whose in touch with her sexuality must be seen as a threat? Stone's style is shallow and unnaturally melodramatic, but given the context, she achieves rare heights as the smooth sex-pot. The sex in the film is violent and overdone, perhaps necessary to remind the audience of the deliberate nature of its crassness. Without it, the film may suffer, but the carnal interludes are little more than diversions from richly cheap dialogue and an audacious performance by Stone. This is a film not to be taken seriously, but seriously quoted. It's a shameful, fun romp, complete with one-dimensional characters operating in a world with no sense of reality . . . but done with real style.",Basic Instinct

The reasons? Well for one Verhoeven is too commercially focused in his approach and the dialog the twists and the whole atmosphere of the film is too clichéd and hollywoodish and too manipulative even, for it's own good.Without being able to sustain a finesse that saviors other similarly flawed but more ""classic"" attempts in some film noir ..Some seem to believe that the acting was fine.Well it was not...The dialogues are unnecessarily rude often annoying and wooden and they convey in a cold manner the attitude of the characters which is very ""ninenties"" like, that is, over macho and supposedly ""cool"".In result the characters just appear selfish and over-stylishly empty.You can relate to them i suppose if you are easily impressed or if you can adopt such a self centered emptiness..But why should you?If you found yourself over-enjoying this film and you are over 25 then i would think that a reevaluation of your system of values would be in order....",Basic Instinct

Certain scenes drag, and there are many more with plot points or a that lack common sense. I dont know how this movie was percieved when it came out, but with todays eyes it just looks like the makers of this movie tried way too hard, and put way too much effort into making it adult and dark, instead of making an enjoyable experience for the viewer. And that is how i would best summarize my feelings of this movie, it kept my attention for two hours but it was overall disappointing and not all that enjoyable.TLDR: The movie is ok but tries a bit too hard with being adult, is kinda stupid, but it does keep your interest even though certain scenes drag.

The trail leads to Catherine Tramell, former girlfriend of the rock star and a brilliant writer of murder novels with a dark past. Turns out that the murder was completely described in one of her books, which makes her one of the suspects. She's writing a new one by the way, about an L.A. cop who falls for the wrong woman.... 1992's most successful film -not in the States, but the rest of the world loves this kind of trash- that made a superstar out of Sharon Stone. And it's got a lot going for it. Technically marvellous, D.P. Jan de Bont shows his stuff in the car chase, slick editing, blood & gore, curtesy of Rob Bottin and a great, great score. As long as you don't take the story too seriously, you're in for a good time. But it's about sex, plain and simple. The interrogation of Miss Tramell must be the finest example of this. The way in which she takes control of the situation, holding power over al these men, D.A's and other hotshots, by uncrossing her legs and showing a glimpse is simply brilliant.And exactly why was the gay community so outraged upon its release? Isn't it a sign of true integration and acceptance of gays/lesbians when one can be a seductive and murderous character in a movie??? Just proves that they're just as human as the next guy/gal.

Of course we loved it and this has become a guilty pleasure movie for me ever since. I now love it for everything else besides the sex scenes. It's a great thriller with great acting from every one involved. Sharon Stone was perfect for this role and I really love the way Michael Douglas plays his part. Tripplehorn looked the best I've ever seen her in this and Denis Arndt is great as Lieutenant Walker.I've read a lot of arguing over the years as who the real killer ended up being with many people believing it was Catherine. The movie definitely leaves it open to interpreting it all on your own and it's like the bible where you can read a passage but get different meaning out of it. I always took it like Dr Garner was working with Catherine or Dr Garner was working alone and Catherine was just going along with it.

I was drawn in mostly out of curiosity and simply craving the retro feeling and California locale. I mainly remembered how scandalous this seemed when it came out, that it was sexy and daring, and that was about it. Well, and the...weapon. And the interrogation. But wow, I frankly don't think we (and certainly the critics!) fully appreciated this movie back then. Daring indeed, I don't think the world had quite seen a woman as such embodied by Stone before, she was the ultimate incarnation of sexuality, confidence, and evil brilliance. I am not sure it has ever been matched. Simply perfection. I love the way the movie was shot, it was on the one hand informal like a cop buddy murder mystery movie, but that was merely the backdrop to the incessant tension and stimulation between Stone and Douglas--it was also rich with cinematography, you could taste San Francisco and the salt of the coast, while transported to a very different time, now far in the past. They captured it perfectly. But the story, the drama, the intrigue, the nail-biting and simultaneous arousal--it was to me an evolved take on--and much sexier version of--a Hitchcock film.

233,sinatra-11,And God Created 'Basic Instinct' for Sharon Stone,8,28 November 2007,"In my opinion, 'Basic Instinct' is one of the most well-known movies in the world. People remember it for lascivious images of Sharon Stone's exposed slender leg and an attractiveness that could attract any man. Like Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone created her own persona Catherine Tramell.After watching the film, I changed my mind about blonde girls. Before watching the film, I thought blonde girls were cute, buxom and kind. There brilliant's was not a issue. Catherine, however, was more brilliant than I expected.She can brain-wash others an even control them. Although I saw it many times, I am still confused who is the real criminal. Maybe murder itself was not the issue. One thing I can sure about is that she made people confused very often. Because she sometimes spoke very ambiguously.Anyway, I learned that the most kind of brilliant criminal is a girl, because she can use her sexual charm. I think that through it, Sharon Stone created a new persona and developed her career as an actress.Marilyn Monroe is famous for the image of her dress blowing up above her waist by passing train underneath the subway grate she is standing on. Like her, Sharon Stone is famous for crossing and uncrossing her legs revealing the fact she was not wearing any underwear while being questioned by the police.I would say, 'Niagara' made Marilyn Monroe a star and God Created 'Basic Instinct' for Sharon Stone.",Basic Instinct

To begin with, the film begins with a murder and grabs you from the beginning, from that moment the film does not stop at almost no time and the short time it stops is when the film becomes slow and boring, but when the mystery resumes the film returns to its incredible rhythm. Perhaps the main flaw of the film is that the protagonist is not so interesting and his personal problems are not very interesting.
Michael Douglas does a good job, but Sharon Stone is the one who carries the film forward with her incredible performance.

238,tmensamaster-2,Classic Verhoeven,9,1 November 2002,"Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite directors. His movies are so damn entertaining. They always, well I should say most of the time, have wit and intelligence [Forget 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man', any director can make mistakes] and have either graphic sex or violence or both. 'Basic Instinct' is in the latter category. It is so erotic and Stone and Douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an Adrian Lyne film, you see them for the crap they are.Basic plotline has Stone's character, 'Catherine Tramell', accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. Douglas's character has a strange attraction to her, which may not lead to good things..... Paul Verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's  classic masterpiece 'Vertigo'. In fact, Stone wears, in sequence, the same wardrobe as Kim Novak did [which makes you wonder, was she wearing panties under her clothes]. That brings us to the interrogation scene, which is the best in the movie. Stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great, Stone releases it by playing 'peek-a-boo'  with the space in between her legs. Every male viewer cherishes that scene, simply because it is so sexy. That word can be used throughout the film, as Stone and Douglas do the mattress mumbo. At the time, the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing un-simulated sex. The film is still quite sexually daring today and  has an intriguing spider's web plot too. The plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether Sharon is innocent or guilty..........The film's only misstep occurs at the end, with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid, contrived game. But it's not. It keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end, which is what a good erotic thriller should. Actually, the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone, as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....The film is great Verhoeven. It has his usual, hilarious, seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. The fact that Verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful film-making. Well, have I said 'sexy' enough times? Then go rent it.........8/10P.S. If you like this one, check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically.",Basic Instinct
239,Spinal-Column,Great if you're 14!,4,1 February 2003,"I had fond memories of BASIC INSTINCT because, when I was about 14, I thought this was the sexiest film ever made! Looking at it now, the movie no longer has the same appeal. BASIC INSTINCT really delivers in the pert breast category, but if you want anything more than that in a movie then I wouldn't bother with this.The movie is very much inspired by classic film noir. But the main difference is that film noir of the 40s and 50s was subject to very strict censorship laws (the Hayes Production Code). Now that film censorship is much more relaxed (except in Britain, it seems) we can see a lot more gore, sex, nudity, violence and swearing. BASIC INSTINCT provides all of these things but nothing more.I can understand why many lesbians found the film offensive -all of the lesbian characters are manipulative and violent. Perhaps this wouldn't have been a problem if Hollywood balanced things out by featuring nicer, more normal lesbian characters in some movies, but that doesn't really happen.I liked BASIC INSTINCT more than Verhoeven's Dutch film in the same vein, THE FOURTH MAN. At least this isn't so pretentious and pseudo-arty. Just remember that the only real reason this film exists is to showcase Sharon Stone's fantastic boobs -if that is enough for you then order your copy today!4/10",Basic Instinct

242,Jagged-11,"sleazy, amoral and worryingly entertaining",8,3 August 2003,"How does one begin a review of what is arguably the most controversial movie of the 90's? Perhaps I should start by saying that although Basic Instinct is complete trash with nothing residing beneath its glitzy surface(despite the claims of Camille Paglia there are NO subliminal meanings and the phallic symbolism of the ice pick is purely coincidental) it's also a riveting psychological thriller with Doublas and Stone providing an impressive double in a refreshingly gripping film.I will not go deeply into plot detail, as the story is practically part of hollywood folklore, but in summary volatile cop Nick Curran(Michael Douglas) falls in love with murder suspect Catherine Trammell(Sharon Stone) who may,or may not, have brutally murdered her lover with an ice pick. If the plot sounds familiar its probably due to the fact that Basic Instinct is essentially a combination of writer Joe Eszthera's film 'Jagged Edge' and director Paul Verhoeven's film 'The Fourth Man', both of which had their fair share of sex and fashionable violence. Despite this Basic Instinct still is enjoyable and having seen either of those films will have no affect on the unpredictability of the film.At the centre of the film is Stone's performance which is actually quite superb(though in the long run this film's been more of a curse than a blessing to her film career)as although she's easily the least probable femme fatale ever to grace(or poison to be more accurate) the silver screen, Stone plays her with such zeal that we can't take our eyes off her. That said it should also be pointed out that she becomes rather less intriguing after the first 40 minutes when she becomes involved with Michael Douglas, as her character loses a great deal of her mystique and her personality has less bite. Then of course is the infamous scene (which practically every other reviewer has mentioned and I am going to be no exception) where Tramell is being interrogated by the police and coolly turns the tables on them by exploiting their libidos and reducing them to drooling idiots, totally ridiculous but easily the film's best scene and certainly one that is not going to be soon forgotten (no doubt to the chagrin of Sharon Stone).The rest of the cast are fine, with Michael Douglas doing the character he does best(the rather thuggish white male who constantly gets involved with the wrong kind of woman), Jeanne Tripplehorn doing an adequate job as Nick's pyschologist and George Dzunda manages to be the only half-way likable character in the movie as Curran's best(and only)friend. Unfortunately Leilani Sarelle is under-used as Catherine Trammell's enigmatic girlfriend(I forgot to mention Catherine's Bi-sexual).The film is, of course, not without flaws. No-one (not even the director) could deny that Basic Instinct has such big plot holes you could park a car in them as for some of the events in the film to make sense characters would need to be either clairvoyant or in possession of other-worldly powers. The endings also a bit of a cop out (no I WON'T reveal it) as it was clearly engineered so that it could be easily changed with a single edit if preview audiences were unsatisfied with it.It is also impossible to ignore the huge controversey that surrounded the films release with a particulair furor being caused by feminists and lesbians over their portrayal in the film. In truth the jury's still out on wether Basic Instinct is homophobic, but I personally don't think it is as the characters' sexuality is never really an issue although in fairness it is used as a somewhat cheap plot device to titillate the audience. The case made by feminists is much stronger as all the women in the film are portrayed as dubious and potentially dangerous. The main defence against all this is that, frankly, all the characters are unpleasent and devious , with perhaps one exception, and no discrimination is given in any way. The other issue was, of course, the sex scenes which ,although explicit, are really rather passé these days.The film is stylishly filmed, expertly paced, brilliantly directed and has a superb music score from Jerrry Goldsmith. I'll give it a high score(by my standards) of 8 out of 10",Basic Instinct

Keep in mind that this film is 50 percent nudity and 50 percent suspense. So don't watch it with your parents and definitely don't let your grandmother watch it. Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone make a great protagonist and antagonist respectively. It also helps that Sharon Stone looks her best. The movie is full of twists and suspense and a who done it all the way through to the end. This movie is twenty years old now and can still hold water to any thriller released today.

246,zionnoizrecords,Proves that you can confuse people into thinking you're deep by distracting them with sex,4,12 March 2016,"If this movie had no sex, it would be the most pointless, predictable 'thriller' ever. So what about with the sex included, is it any better? No, the sex scenes are super awkward and gratuitous, obviously in an effort to push the boundaries of what was considered graphic in the early 90s. Meanwhile we're meant to be pulled into this world where there's kind of danger and sex matters more than anything else in life. Not only is that not true for anyone who isn't a sociopath, the mere suggestion that it's our most basic instinct to recklessly mate with whomever attracts us regardless of the threat of, um...DEATH is pretty laughable.Who wrote this movie, my best friend when I was 13? I was hoping for something with intrigue, this was complete trash. Any parts of it that had potential were completely abandoned in an effort to be edgy and provocative. Basic Instinct is neither of those things, it's just a poorly written 'thriller' (yeah right, hard to be thrilled when you're just waiting for someone to put their clothes on and actually behave like a normal person for two seconds) full of weak, ephemeral, and completely unnecessary plot-points, which neither resulted in a good mystery, nor a provocative look at the baser human urges. Just because this movie gets referenced a lot in pop-culture (just for the nudity and sex scenes mind you) doesn't mean it's worth watching, it's not. Save your time and watch a porn if that's what you're into, this movie is just porn for people who like to feel that there's some deep beauty to their narcissism. P F F T4/10",Basic Instinct

Nevertheless, there is interesting characters, genuinely good mystery and much tension to be had if you watch this movie.",Basic Instinct
248,gordon_brennan,"Good movie, great sex and tons of Sharon Stone",8,21 September 2009,"Oddly enough, Basic Instinct to me is in the same league as Jaws and Psycho: something from the film literally impacts the culture. How many times have you gone swimming and hoped a shark wouldn't come? Or whether somebody's outside your shower curtain? And of course we always hum their respective themes, whether we're going after someone in a pool/lake or making a stabbing motion with that irritating-but-effective high pitched Psycho theme. Well add silk scarves and icepicks to the list. Detective Nick Curran is investigating a case of an old rocker killed in bed while tied up and repeatedly stabbed. Their trail leads them to his ""girlfriend"" Catherine Tramell, a novelist. Interestingly, a character in one of her books is killed in the precise manner as the rocker. So is someone framing her, or does she know that people would think she's nuts for killing someone in the exact way she wrote it obviously naming her the killer? Then Nick starts to get obsessed. The sexually charged presence of Catherine affects him, making him smoke in non-smoking buildings and even having rough sex with his girlfriend. He also has to deal with Catherine's girlfriend(and not in the ""girl and she's a friend"")Roxie, who's quite jealous. So the question becomes is Nick dating the killer he's looking for? Or is Catherine's lover a little too obsessive? The film was extremely controversial when it first came out. Not only for the sex filled narrative but also the ""treatment"" of gay and lesbians. Some gays and lesbians aren't crazy? We're not always that idealic view that we have. In a special feature on the Desperate Housewives set, Felicity Huffman recalls the scene where a woman asks ""isn't it great being a mom?"" Well yeah if you don't factor in the sleepless nights, frantic running around and calling for babysitters and housework. Same idea here. Sure Roxie is slightly off and a bit obsessive but isn't some of them? Like Norman Bates said, we all go a little mad sometimes. Now the sex in the film is never explicit. We don't see anything that'd get the film NC-17 but it sure implies a lot. We got implied oral on male and female, standard positions, tons of nudity and even some girl-on-girl lesbian kissing(sorry guys, no love scene with those 2). The unrated version just merely extends shots by a few seconds or changes the camera angle, such as Nick and Catherine's first sexual encounter. As for extra features they're not bad, including one feature that shows what was cut out(which really needs to be implemented more in these unrated editions). The commentaries are OK except you might find famed feminist author Camille Paglia a bit irritating since she's so university-lecture and overemphazing things. For example here's something she mentions about the interrogation scene: ""The intensity of looking in this scene, looking on the part of the men, on Catherine's part, on our part, raises the temperature in the scene. There's a kind of sadism as Catherine plays with her prey. There's a kind of evocation of great movies about St. Joan, where in this case, the perverse saint, a Mary Magdalene figure, is defying her interrogators."" Um, lady it's just a scene.

263,nickmiller95,Basic instinct is a classic who-dun-it,7,21 December 2020,"So, who is guilty?In a broader sense, is it the women who claim to love us, that support us every step of the way? Are they actually twisted and manipulating us into loving them? Or is it the ones who openly play games and won't accept the role of a good little girl? Oh, they must be evil since they represent forbidden fruit (they are capable of bringing our worst desires out, but are simultaneously worth whatever the outcome might be). In the end it's easier to say the former... or is it the last?Notice there are two fade-outs - therefore, two possible endings. Well, for us, but as far as the detectives in this film are concerned, the answer is the former. It's 'cause they are men and men always blame whoever it's the easiest to (it's their basic instinct). Eh, feel free to disregard that one. But, of course, this mayhem acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy, making women thus capable of the roles created for them. Sure, there is more than just this feminist take on the movie, and that's why, as limited as the last part of it make its whole out to be, it is albeit an interesting one. What's the most probable answer for audience?Could be that Catherine did it - because for everything to go smoothly she had to correctly assume that Nick is, indeed, quick on the trigger and will shoot anybody, even somebody he is intimate with (provided that she messes with his head enough). And Catherine definitely does have the psychological arsenal needed to make the correct assumption. Whereas Beth is truly gullible - clever and capable otherwise, but at that exact moment she is hopelessly in love and therefore as dumb as they come. She above all trusts Nick and that ends, well, badly for her. Any other explanation would have to involve her either wanting to die or playing a game with Catherine as to see which one of them Nick loves more - but that's stretching it too far. Also, this solution satisfies the question about the title - Nick in the end acted on his basic instinct to kill which is something he shares with Catherine and something Catherine is obssesed with observing in people. That could also be the reason why she didn't finish him off in the end - they being akin and all (although it eludes me as to why that should be the case, given that the character of Nick is no match to Catherine's and comes across as terribly dull - but that could be just my sentiment).Well, the only thing left for us to do is **** like minks, forget about this movie and live happily ever after!",Basic Instinct
264,LussvonTrier,The grandiose portrayals of sex and violence in here aren't backed up with substance whatsoever.,1,9 April 2016,"Well, I have to confess, the movie did keep me on the verge of my seat the entire time. And while watching I even caught me on the thought that this actually is a brilliant creation. Guilty. It was only after the final cliffhanger, the very final scenes, that I genuinely felt disappointed and tricked into something overly fake and pseudo- artistic. There are a couple of elements in here, though, that I salute, one being Sharon Stone, of course. I mean, my god, she redefined ""sexy"" in this film and the now-classic interrogation scene was fantastic. I also think that Jeanne Tripplehorn's performance was majorly underrated. She was amazing and it's a pity she didn't really get to do anything noteworthy after that. I also loved the music and sound editing. In fact, the whole sound department did a great job transmitting the energy and intensity to the viewer. But, let's admit it, even the most engrossing atmosphere in a movie should sustain a plot, coherent, connected, fulfilled. There is nothing of the sort in here. In the simplest form, the movie is stupid. It's supposed to be an erotic detective/thriller. And while it succeeds (at least relatively) at being erotic it fails at being detective. Throughout the film there are two major homicide suspects and it does a great job maneuvering between them and keeping you guessing until the very end. But in the end, when the cards unfold, you realize that the director and the screenwriter simply didn't do their homework very well. They give you so much details (sometimes intertwined) about the past actions of the two suspects that,in the end, whoever the real killer might be, there will be major plot holes and at least one mentioned murder left unexplained. And even if (you think) the two of them did it together still huge blanks will be untouched. As I mentioned I loved Sharon Stone which cannot be said about Douglas. Before Basic Instinct I didn't like him. He was basically okay. But, my god, I hated him in here. He was supposed to portray a violent, smart, intelligent, daring character and he ended up portraying a complete pu**y unable to make up his mind. He was terrible at action sequences as well as dialogues as well as, hmm, sex. And yeah, about sex, though, I genuinely welcome the then-new (erotic) approach to the thriller genre I thought it was too pretentious, histrionic and fake. The annoying multiple death teases during sex were the worst. Basic Instinct is actually a poor assembly of fine ingredients: Music- Check, Intensity-Check, Atmosphere- Check, Sex-Check, Violence- Check, Idea- Check, Realization-...Ups...Error. The movie really needed a David Fincher to make something worthwhile out of it. And what seems groundbreaking and smart in here is basically a simulation.",Basic Instinct

This was and still is in my opinion the benchmark for all erotic thrillers. Paul Verhoeven gets this sexy, edge of your seat thriller bang on the mark with his slick directing and Joe Ezterhaz' script summed up what movies in the early 90s aimed to achieve.... shock, awe and excitement.Mchael Douglas is perfectly cast as Nick, the ""burnt out cop whose best friend is the bottle"" character we all know too well. His character has a real believable edge to it though as he struggles with his demons as a disgraced police detective put in charge of a murder investigation involving sex and murder. Prime suspect is the beautiful and sexy Catherine Tramell, played perfectly by Sharon Stone. In the role that made her, she exudes the kind of sexual energy (the interrogation scene) that no man could resist and this is what makes her character so interesting.As the movie progresses, so to does the attraction from Nick towards Catherine and Catherine who is a novelist begins to manipulate Nick to her own ends. The chemistry between Douglas and Stone is palpable and the movie has an enormous erotic charge with a real hint of danger to it which adds to the excitement.Sharon Stone is the main reason to watch this movie, she is beautiful, dangerous, cold, calculated, intelligent and completely sexy. But is she the killer? More suspects surface as the plot thickens. There is also a sort of ambiguity to the film that is in someways what makes it more dark and mysterious.Much was made of the sex scenes when the movie was originally released and I would just comment that they are very well done and have an animalistic charge, which is indeed what the movie is all about. When the attraction between Douglas and Stones characters comes to a height we get the most erotic and sexually raw encounter I have come across in this kind of genre.Other performances of note are that of the lovely Jeanne Tripplehorne (Beth) who is more than just counselling Nick, the beautiful Leillani Sarelle (Roxy) who is Catherines lesbian lover with her own ""skeletons in the closet"" and George Dzundza (Gus) Nicks police partner and only real friend.I would just say that they don't make em like they used to and Basic Instinct is testament to that opinion. A lot of twists, turns, mind games, sex and violence is what constitutes this thrill ride with a brilliant music score and sensual nightclub tracks too boot!

At one point, Douglas gets hit by a car - twice - and shows absolutely no physical side effects. Douglas takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And, his hair looks great.

Best to see this before getting into other film noir's or Hitch's works. The overemphasis on how glamorous Sharon Stone is lets it down a bit. She ain't glamorous enough for the script over emphasising how great she is.Toned down somewhat the script would have been more convincing and the results more satisfying. This is a cult film and criticism will not dent that. The interrogation scene alone has given it this status to the bemusement of some.,Basic Instinct
274,the_dark_gift_,Basic Instinct (1992),9,11 October 2002,"This movie was an exciting erotic thriller. Stone plays her role exceptionally well as the snappy, sexy Tramell. Michael Douglas does a fair job of playing his role as Detective Curran but he's done better. (Checkout Wallstreet or Traffic) The movie is a murderous thrilling mystery yet twisted in are some highly entertaining/shocking scenes in which the main characters acting are put to the test and I'd definetly give them a passing grade. I recommend this movie to all movie goers for it's abundant entertainment and especially anyone who loves Stone.",Basic Instinct
275,blacktear95,A porn with a story,5,22 July 2009,"I don't know why so many people say:""That's a brilliant thriller with hot sex scenes.You must watch it, it's one of the best movies which are ever made""!WHAT !! The story is not a new and the sex scenes are hot at the first time, but not 5 times the same. Sharon shows all ,but no talent for being an actress. Douglas doesn't play better as her and I have to laugh all time when somebody call Douglas ,SHOOTER.I think it's a 08/15 thriller with one erotic sex scene and bad actors and actresses.I don't say it's one of the worst movies ,but not one of the best,too. If you want to see a brilliant thriller ,then you have to watch Lucky # Slevin.",Basic Instinct
276,sayno-23,I can not agree with the 6.9 grade for this exciting movie.,8,22 June 2011,"Dear readers, I can not agree with the 6.9 grade for Basic Instinct. The movie is exciting and has a mysterious aura around it from beginning tell end. Sharon Stone plays this woman with verve! The scene with the interrogation of Sharon Stone is really strong and convincing. Not only the man who are interrogating her are at the edges of their seats, but also you at home or behind a screen is being captured by her.The plot is great. The title of the movie says it all, but detective Nick Curran and you as a spectator are greatly manipulated and put on a leash by Catherine Tramell until you really start believing in her faked goodness. But only at the end of the movie you get a glimpse of the possible answer to the first murder with which the movie all started. The rest you're just guessing.And then the scenes and all powerful aura of wealthy places, people, Picasso's, clubs, sex, acting, talking, hunting after each other does it all. Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are not alone, no you are also there capturing and living it like they do.So the most strong points are the excitement, the acting especially of Sharon Stone, the mysterious murder, the icepick and the manipulation all during the movie.A weaker item of the movie is the murder of Curran on his ex-wife. That scene, when she is walking towards while grabbing in her pocket while Curran is pointing a gun at her, seems a bit too stupid for a psychiater and anyhow any men to do in such a situation. You get on your knees and show your hands.A great movie, which you should see on special occasions and at a maximum once a year.Zeno Snoei",Basic Instinct
277,GuardianAngels,Twist and highly unorthodox,10,20 March 2006,"The credits already show the ambiguous atmosphere of this thriller thanks to the beautiful music written by Jerry Goldsmith as well as the light plays, the moving human shadows in a mirror effect and the lozenges reminding you Picasso's cubism. The next scene sets the tone : the worst and the best, the pleasure and the cruelty, savagely filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Even the protagonist hated that scene - nearly fainting to see all this fake blood and tired to be sitting for hours on an extra. The next stage, the investigation can start : car chases near the coast worthy of Hitchcock's movies, manipulation, to play someone's game, suspense, new development. We must not forget the cult moment of this movie - the questioning scene - being filmed by the cops for investigation purposes - a movie within a movie. The actors were conscious of the fact they played a great moment that will leave its marks in cinematic history. A masterpiece that keeps you in suspense during 2 hours until the last frame !",Basic Instinct
278,suicehyde,Weak,6,29 August 2014,"A rather underwhelming movie with a weak plot. The writers, it would seem, were more concerned with the sex scenes & sex chats -- Not that those were impressive either. They got really old, really fast and I was more interested in the general plot outside the humping and grunting but to my despair, I found out that this movie is nothing more than a pretentious, high-strung porno movie. It had potential to be more than that but the writers were just lazy.I would say this movies is overrated and a bit on the boring side but it does get good in certain places were the focus is on Michael Douglas' character trying to solve the crime. However, how the writers chose to tie up the story was gratingly stupid and ruined the movie. What were Catherine's motives? Sometimes it helps to leave some things to the viewers' imagination but in this case it just fell flat. The whole movie and the characters were just there to facilitate the sex scenes. Disappointing.6/10",Basic Instinct
279,stuart_copeland,As hot as it gets!!!!!!!,10,18 August 2005,"I've seen this movie often but every time I watch it I think it's getting'sexier. I could not explain why but this movie makes me sweat even if I don't see a picture of it! ""B:I"" mixes up gory murders with sado-masochistic sex-scenes which were never seen in cinema before. This was brave and even though I really hate Paul Verhoeven I had to say ""Well Done Dude!"" cause I was so impressed! But the best thing is - Sharon Stone: such a beautiful, sexy and desirable woman don't even live on mars (if there's any life out there - maybe we find out one day). Michael Douglas is a great actor honestly but this role is one of his least performances. But who could have made it better than he? The story is old-fashioned (I've seen it million times before ) and the surprisingly end was not helping out with that problem. Mr. Eszterhas should learn how to write a screenplay without the famous clishees about detectives and femme fatales. To the sequel crashing in 2006: it's gonna be impossible to top this sensual thriller even if Mrs. Stone has a body double for her bed scenes. But it will be interesting what Catherine Tramell is going to do now when Nicky's away. Whatever happens: this two hours of film history will last about 20 years till we all forget what we've seen",Basic Instinct

281,Wes-13,Just Love It (original director's cut),9,23 December 2000,"I first saw this movie at it's theatrical release and then later stumbled upon the original director's cut video(red box) at Best Buy.  This is absolutely the one to see. I watched it again last night, and then went to this data base to review other viewer's comments and finally to vote (9) myself. The director's cut is fabulous as far as I am concerned. The acting (esp. Douglas) is super, the tight hard boiled dialogue and dramatic scenes are excellent, the music score is ""eery"" and perfect for this type of movie, and the whole production design keeps the viewer spellbound throughout. The only real hangup is the icepick at the very end. It ""throws"" the viewer into a state of limbo and leaves the ending a bit unresolved in the viewer's mind. To be sure, those who have seen this one either loved it or hated it, but on must view the director's cut on it's own terms: that is of good sound, well done movie making regardless of the subject matter.",Basic Instinct

The acting, story and dialogue are all fantastic.
This movie also has very graphic sex scenes which are used very well for plot and character purposes but I'm sure wont be seen that way by some immature teens, probably anyone under 16, or older if watching with friends. So it's not something I would watch with the guys, my parents or kids (if I had them).",Basic Instinct
284,btbshining,What A Film!,9,18 September 2001,"This is one of my favorite films, even though it has some problems.The film caused controversy with some of the gay crowd (who didn't like the negative press) and for the graphic sex (with bedroom violence). It became a box office winner, that made Sharon Stone a star, and yet was basically p****d on by the critics! The word is the film is better than your average B movie skin flick, only by the quality of the actors, and Verhoeven's ability. I feel the film is still not given the respect it's  due. I first saw the R-rated version, which is very good, but now you can get the even better Unrated Director's Cut, which has even more graphic content! If you don't like erotic-thrillers, then don't see it. But anyone with taste will enjoy the thrill ride of events that take place in Basic Instinct. The script by Joe Eszterhas was highly thought of in Hollywood, and if not for the graphic nudity, a top star like Michelle Pfeiffer would have taken the role made famous by Sharon stone.Does the script go too far at times? Yes, but that's part of the films charm, and after all, the now 'classic film moment' of Sharon Stone's leg spread interrogation, likely would have been dropped in a conventional film. Still though, I wouldn't have minded seeing a few less people getting killed off, to keep even more suspense and realism. The score is also beautiful, and fans of Hitchcock's great ""Vertigo"" can appreciate the homage that Paul Verhoeven has included. The film has a lot of eye candy, but Jeanne Tripplehorn deserves special mention for her impressive supporting role (sadly she hasn't done much of note since). Michael Douglas does a solid job also, but I can't help wondering if a better actor like Clint Eastwood could have brought more to the table. The dialogue is not up to the level of ""Pulp Fiction"", but it's still interesting and fun. I highly recommend this film for fans of adult mystery.",Basic Instinct

Its even possible that ""Cowboy"" Gus, Nick's partner, could have killed LT Marty Nilsen, no-one seems to remember that. Sure theres no clues he did, but who knows? Dr Garner seems to be the killer of Gus at least but if you pause the film near the end you can make out the outline of the killers hooded face and it sure aint Dr Garner! But did she kill her own husband in years gone by? There are so many variables, it almost leaves you to decide for yourself. Superb.

304,longtake,Problematic but Intelligent thriller about the the relationship between audience and cinema,8,30 January 2005,"Basic Instinct was an entry into the neo-noir genre of the 90's (The Last Seduction, Fatal Attraction etc ) that tried to update 40's/50's American film noir as well as bringing in elements of Hitchcock's Vertigo. On this level Basic Instinct is a brilliant conveyor of noir themes that portrays an unstable detective out of control in an intricate unfathomable plot with a femme fatale, Hollywood mansions, dark shadowy rooms, smart cynical dialogue and smoking. It is also flawed on this level with its unnatural characterisation. However, the artificiality of the plot, genre, characterisations and the look creates a distance between the viewer and the film. When you take this into account along with the constant references to watching in the film, outlined below, the film moves to a different level. It is no longer about whether Catherine Tramell is the killer but is more about the spectatorial process of watching a (Hollywood) film.For example, Catherine Tramell(Sharon Stone) is a writer whose murder plots exactly follow the murders that occur in the film. Her coolness and openness about these killings gives her a sense of being in control of Nick Curran's(Michael Douglas) destiny. In this way, she is like cinema itself spinning a predetermined plot line that the audience represented by Douglas just follows.Throughout the film, the detective seems resigned to his lack of control, totally in awe of Catherine Tramell ready to go along with her. This is similar to the way the audience submits itself inside the cinema to the control that the screen exerts. However just as we do, Curran attempts to predetermine the plot with his own expectations. He tells Tramell that he has his own idea how it will end - ""The cop survives"" - The final question of ""What do we do now, Nick?"" is met with ""F*** like minxes, raise rug rats, live happily ever after."" another idealistic expectation of the cinema audience. However the ambiguous final shot reminds us that Douglas/the audience may not get the ending he wants - only cinema decides whether that ice pick under the bed will be used.Another parallel with the cinema experience is the way Nick Curran seems to identify with Tramell. At the start he is a recovered smoker and drinker and Tramell gets him to start again. Over the course of the film his attraction to Tramell's character makes him take on more and more of her traits - aggressive sexuality, risk taking, use of her dialogue and more and more leaps into fantasy. He is almost merging with her and this is reflected in his interrogation scene being shot identically to Tramell's earlier one. Again this development mirrors the way cinema audiences identify with the film narrative. The Hollywood ideal is that the viewer leaves his/her outside of the cinema in order to temporarily identify with the fantasy characters on screen.Another main aspect of the cinema experience touched on here is the voyeuristic process of watching itself. Curran is constantly in a spectatorial position. It is most obvious where he watches Tramell through a window that looks like a cinema screen itself. Another scene where he is trying to find out about Tramell on a computer sees him reprimanded by a colleague for ""jacking off to the screen"". This likens Douglas to an audience member watching the film in a similarly voyeuristic way. This is the reason why Hitchcock is such a strong influence on this film - these are classic Hitchcockian themes.My final comparison is the bi-directional aspect of cinema touched on in the film. The interrogation scene where Tramell manipulates the audience of detectives is the only time where Tramell has point of view, reminding us that cinema watches and manipulates us as well. Also the fact that throughout Tramell knows so much about Detective Curran's past is a similar device. Tramell uses what she knows about Curran to make her murder work, just as Hollywood exploits what it knows about our desires of movies in order to sell us their product. (And those desires may have been partly contrived by Hollywood).The female murderers (who look like old film stars) that Tramell hangs around with represent other archetypal Hollywood stories - maybe these could have been other films that Nick Curran watched before when he took up smoking before.Is it a coincidence that the words ""cinema theatre"" can be found in the name Catherine Tramell and the word ""audience"" can be found in ""Detective Nick Curran"" ? Probably.",Basic Instinct
305,christopher90045,a thriller with an interesting twist on the old detective vs. a suspect who happens to be an irresistible babe as well as a hard as nails dame.,10,26 December 2004,"I gave this film a 10 in part because 12 years after seeing it for the first -- and only -- time, it still evokes a spontaneous ""wow, it was great"" whenever I think of it. The screenplay was truly excellent in its genre, leaving you guessing and revising your guess throughout the film. It should also be commended for daring to portray an ""uber""- homosexual with no apology to either conservative homophobes or the zealously politically correct.Douglas merits praise for this performance, which was so good that I was able to put my intense dislike of him for personal reasons aside and worry about the safety of the character he portrayed in the film.As for Sharon Stone, it only takes one performance like the one in this film to make an indelible mark. Superb. I had no idea who Sharon Stone was when I went to see this film and I left the theater as mesmerized by her screen presence as I had been by Faye Dunaway's in Bonnie and Clyde and Kristin Scott Thomas in Brideshead Revisited. The caliber of her breakthrough in this film matches that of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential and Angelina Jolie in Girl Interrupted.In much the same way as Glenn Close set the standard for a certain character type in Fatal Attraction, Stone established the standard for another character type against which all subsequent interpretations should be measured. If it were only to see how beautiful Stone is in this film it would be well worth the rental.

It has loads of suspense, high tension, catchy and memorable dialogues, great actors, fabulous music score and an excellent director who didn't get scared off by protesters and other hypocrites. And yes, they are hypocrites in my mind, people who watch this movie are meant to be mature, thus denying sex is either hypocritical or prudish. If that's not your thing okay, then don't watch it but don't rate it low just because you can't handle it. Because the sex scenes are really just a few minutes long (I'm European and they're really aren't that strong) but make up a large part of Catherine's character and are a fundamental part of the plot. The film would be unthinkable without them but shouldn't be reduced to them either.

They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and if so ole Alfred must be very flattered indeed - everything about this movie oozes Hitchcock.

311,maxx01_23,maxx01_23,10,19 July 2005,"I love this movie. I think Sharon Stone is one of the most sexy women in the world. I also think that Michael Douglas's performance was great. I regret that I don't have a copy of this film. The cast was brilliant and also the plot. In my opinion, Basic Instinct is one of the greatest American productions ever and I hope that movies like Basic Instinct will be produced in the future. I would have nominated it to Oscar if I would have the occasion. It was a great idea that Sliver was produced, but it was not a ""second part"" of my favorite American film. Thanks for reading my message and HI to everyone on-line!",Basic Instinct
312,i_van_dobbenburgh,enchanting all the way through,9,29 April 2017,"The suspense and building of tension is off the charts in this Paul Verhoeven movie. As a fellow Dutchman I am proud of his work! The erotic feel throughout the movie is very appealing, as well as the intellectual conversations.I saw the movie in the cinema and it was mind-blowing. Not one dull moment because of the mysterious Catherine Tramell. The flirting and courting between the two lead characters is very sexy. The jealousy and mind games are nice to watch as well as the raw emotions that cause death and betrayal. A masterpiece that fitted Sharon Stone as a glove. Her best work I think. The movie music is just right and adds to the mysteriousness.A must-watch movie that has survived a lot of controversy!",Basic Instinct
