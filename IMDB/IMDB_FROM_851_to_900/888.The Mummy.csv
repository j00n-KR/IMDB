0,TheLittleSongbird,Lacks lustre in almost every department,2,2 July 2017,"Despite concerns (such as whether Tom Cruise would fit), 'The Mummy' did have potential. Some of the previous 'Mummy' films, particularly the instalments with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee and the 1999 film, wasn't crazy about a few of the Lon Chaney entries and 'Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' was a mess. Unfortunately, so is 2017's 'The Mummy'.Before anybody jumps down my throat and accuses me of following the crowd, an accusation that is becoming tiresome and ridiculous and says more about the person making the accusation than the people they're attacking, as said 'The Mummy' did have potential and personally really wanted it to work. This is also coming from somebody who does find herself many times agreeing with critics, but has just as many times gone against the grain, thinking that negatively received films are not that bad while acknowledging their faults and also thinking that acclaimed films are not that good while acknowledging the things it does right. Usually am very encouraging and try to be perceptive, do not take pleasure in bashing films that don't do anything for me.'The Mummy' is such an occasion where to me the critics are on point. Not irredeemable but is lacking in almost every department. Its best things are two good performances. The best performance comes from an imperiously chilling Sofia Boutella, doing such a good job with what she's given to work with, and Annabelle Wallis does decently with relatively little. Some of the scenery is striking and some of the photography is slick and stylish.Sadly the rest of the cast do not work. Tom Cruise is embarrassingly miscast in a role that both doesn't suit him and is long in the tooth for, he also feels out of kilter in the setting. Russell Crowe phones in his performance here, looking miserable and awkward and not making anything of his lines. Cruise and Wallis' chemistry is non-existent. Then we have Jake Johnson providing irritating and very poorly placed comic relief.Not everything works visually either. The way 'The Mummy' is photographed and edited can be too frenetic and the special effects veer on the cheap. The music is generic at best and Alex Kurtzman's direction is muddled and without any kind of soul or a sense that he knew what to do with the film's tone.One of the worst aspects of 'The Mummy' is the dialogue, full of clunky exposition, unfunny and childish humour and often a clichéd shambles it's laughably bad. The story is dull, disjointed and confused, while also tonally a complete mess. It tries to be comedy, action and horror, too many elements, and fails at all three. The comedy is sporadic and none of it is remotely amusing let alone funny. The action is completely lacking in excitement and choreographed in a scattershot and leaden way. The horror elements have none of the chills and scare factors, hurt by its predictability and being unintentionally funny. The ending is one big anti-climax.In summary, a complete mess that fails in almost every department apart from moments of good visuals and two above serviceable performances. 2/10 Bethany Cox",The Mummy
1,bkoganbing,Unwrapped,3,5 February 2018,"Having Tom Cruise head the cast of The Mummy in its latest incarnation certainly
guaranteed some box office. Still this 21st century version of one of Universal's
classic monster genres is nothing to write home about. The Mummy even gets
a sex change.It's the princess who was the object of Boris Karloff's affection back in 1932 that
is our Mummy here. For dabbling in the black arts this royal person was buried
alive and they took her way over to Mesopotamia to bury her. Now it's Iraq war soldier Tom Cruise who discovers the tomb while fighting 
whomever in Iraq, literally falls through. So Annabella Wallis the archeologist
is sent for.For all his disturbing of the dead Tom Cruise gets a big old curse put on him by
the ancient princess Sofia Boutella. Not someone you want to disturb while
she slumbers.As a very big fan of the original Mummy that Boris Karloff with those classically
trained tones gave us that incredibly sad and powerful portrait of Im-Ho-Tep
down to Tom Cruises's All American smirk. Face it Tom, you just didn't belong
here.Russell Crowe is in this one too. I'm strill trying to figure out what his role
exactly was.Leave this Mummy Unwrapped.",The Mummy
2,Leofwine_draca,Flawed but fun,6,11 December 2017,"THE MUMMY is the latest horror reboot from Universal and a deeply flawed Hollywood blockbuster. It stars Tom Cruise who plays something of a bumbling, idiotic lead, a man who inadvertently awakens an Egyptian mummy from her sleep, bringing a curse into the modern world. The film is tonally inconsistent and dominated by big, brash, expensive CGI set-pieces as dust storms and zombie swarms dominate London, but the real surprise is that I actually enjoyed all this to a degree.Not that I should have, not really. The acting is generally sub-par and that comes from someone who doesn't usually mind Cruise. Annabelle Wallis is the worst culprit; I had enough of her in PEAKY BLINDERS and my heart sank when I saw her here. Her acting hasn't improved any. The film suffers from weak writing, including a mixed-up and silly twist ending, and direction from someone clearly inexperienced. On the plus side, the action is quite fun and amusing at times, and I really liked the inclusion of Russell Crowe's character; he seems to be having a lot of fun with his role.",The Mummy
3,SnoopyStyle,bloated world building,5,4 July 2017,"Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) are attached to the American military going behind enemy lines to retrieve ancient artifacts in war-torn Iraq. Nick steals a map from archaeologist Jennifer Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) and discovers a mummy. It is the body of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), an Egyptian princess erased from the records. She searches for a dagger to resurrect the Egyptian god Set. She brings down the plane but Nick somehow survives without a scratch. Chris is dead and his spirit tells Nick that he has been cursed. Nick and Jennifer escape Ahmanet and are rescued by Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) and his men.Universal plans to start a whole Dark Universe. I would prefer a small horror but this is a gigantic action adventure. There are some creepy crawlies but nothing scary. It is mostly a Tom Cruise action flick. The airplane crash is terrific which makes for a good start but it begins to grind down with too much exposition. There's no need for some of it. There is also a desperation to set up the franchise like introducing Dr. Jekyll which only muddles the movie. This could have worked if it simplified a couple of things and relaxed on the world building.",The Mummy
4,Prismark10,The Mummy,5,23 November 2020,"Universal once had a stake in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They made the Hulk movies.Now they cast an envious eye at Disney who purchased Marvel Films and do Universal along with Paramount lost the Marvel characters.Universal has responded by going back to its basics. The Universal monster characters of the 1930s and launched the Dark Universe.The Mummy is part of this and even features a monster mash.Universal already had success with the Mummy trilogy launched in 1997. They were more adventure films with comedy. This is meant to be somewhat grimmer with PG 13 horror.Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) are American soldiers who are sneakily looting ancient artifacts in war torn Iraq. Nick steals a map from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) and discovers the tomb of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) an evil Egyptian princess who was somehow buried in Iraq.The spirit of Princess Ahmanet is still alive as she searches for a dagger that has been recently been unearthed in a mass graves of Crusader knights in London. She plans to resurrect the Egyptian god of death Set.The plane Nick, Chris and Jenny is travelling in crashes. Chris dies, Jenny escapes in a parachute but Nick somehow survives. However Nick sees his dead friend's spirit who tells Nick that he has been cursed and is now undead. Nick is being used by Princess Ahmanet to be reunited with the dagger.Jenny all along has been working for a secret organisation which hunts down supernatural threats leds Dr Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) who plans to use Nick to defeat Princess Ahmanet and Set.The Mummy is a rollercoaster ride with no heart and no fun. It borrows too much from other movies ranging from The American Werewolf in London to Lifeforce.There is some good action set pieces such as the plane crash scene. However the characters are so two dimensional that you hardly care about Nick. Although it turns out that he is actually The Mummy.",The Mummy
5,claudio_carvalho,Tom Cruise's Ego Might Be Satisfied Becoming Young and a God,5,6 August 2017,"""The Mummy"" (2017) is not a remake but a messy and terrible version of the classic storyline. The film is supported by great CGI since the story is weak and the characters are awful and non-charismatic. It is ridiculous and even funny to see the fifty-three (53) year-old Russell Crowe calling the fifty-five (55) year old Tom Cruise of youngster. Tom Cruise's ego might be satisfied becoming young with CGI and Photoshop effects and a god. My vote is five.Title (Brazl): ""A Múmia"" (""The Mummy"")",The Mummy
6,kosmasp,Not a classic,6,2 September 2017,"So I guess after DC universe, Marvel Universe and apparently the Conjuring universe (not in that order and not listed to highlight favorites), we are supposed to get a ""Monster"" universe. And I say supposed because numerous other movies have been announced with quite a few actors attached to them. And all that before the Mummy even got released ... who knows what they would have made with that rather poor Box office results that this movie got in the end? We'll never really know, but right now they seem to be committed to go on.So this has some really good special effects. And has some good actors attached to it. And while Russel Crowe plays a character that is very likely to be featured in other movies, you still wonder if it was necessary casting. And to intermix some of the themes and ""monsters"" if you will. But if you don't mind all that and just want to have a fun ride, the movie provides on that front. It doesn't make much sense, does not have the same sense as the old movies had, which are considered classic ... so always keep that in the back of your mind",The Mummy
7,classicsoncall,"""I think we have angered the gods!""",7,17 September 2019,"I just watched this latest version of ""The Mummy"" right after rewatching the 1999 entry with Brendan Fraser. You won't consider this a remake after seeing it, as it takes the mythology of the 1932 Boris Karloff original that Fraser's picture hung on to, and completely alters the identity of the title character by replacing the Pharoah's High Priest with his lover, in this case, renamed Ahmanet as opposed to Anck Su Namun, and credibly portrayed by Sofia Boutella. I really didn't have a problem with the modification, having long given up being a stickler for continuity among movie sequels. Action and horror fans will most likely find the picture to their liking as well, as there are some intense and harrowing scenes that triggers one's adrenalin. The out of control airplane that crashes right after Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) dispatches Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) with a parachute is one such scene, and virtually all of the mummy sequences are chillingly effective. I thought there would be more desert action as was found in the Fraser picture, but the tone here was a lot darker and didn't call for that much open space and sunlight, preferring those eerie caverns and underground tombs. I also thought Tom Cruise might have slipped in some Jack Reacher moves during his tight spots, but thinking about it, that would have been out of character for an adventurous mercenary like Nick Morton. Still, he had decent chemistry with Ms. Wallis as the Egyptologist Halsey, and the finale sets up a sequel of sorts, knowing that Cruise's character is now not all that he seems to be on the surface. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that score.",The Mummy
8,jboothmillard,The Mummy,4,25 June 2017,"I heard there was going to be a reboot of the Mummy, I assumed it was just remaking the films originally starring Brendan Fraser, in fact this movie is the first in a reboot of all the most famous monsters from Universal Studios, the beginning of the ""Dark Universe"" franchise. Basically, in London, Crossrail workers discover the tomb of an English crusader knight, buried inside with the corpse is a large ruby, authorised to investigate the uncovered find is a mysterious man. Hieroglyphics on a circular mural in the tomb, dating back to the New Kingdom era, tell the story of the ruthless Princess Ahmanet (Razzie nominated Sofia Boutella), in a flashback we see her story. Ahmanet was first in line to succeed the throne from her father Pharaoh Menehptre (Selva Rasalingam), until his second wife gave birth to a son, determined to claim the throne for herself, Ahmanet sold her soul to the Egyptian god Set (Javier Botet), his spirit transfers into a special dagger, she murders her family and attempted to sacrifice her lover to give Set physical form, but she was captured, mummified and buried alive in a sarcophagus for eternity. Back in present day Iraq, mercenary Nick Morton (Razzie winning Tom Cruise) and his partner Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) accidentally discover the tomb of Ahmanet, following a staged airstrike, archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), who had a one-night stand with Nick, joins them to investigate the tomb. After correctly concluding the tomb was a prison, they extract Ahmanet's sarcophagus from a pool of mercury, Nick's superior Colonel Greenway (Courtney B. Vance) has the sarcophagus put on a plane bound for England. Vail was bitten by a camel spider while the group were inside the tomb, he becomes possessed by Ahmanet's power, he attempts to open the sarcophagus, stabs Greenway and attacks the others, Nick is forced to shoot him dead, then a huge swarm of crows invade the plane, causing it to crash, Jenny parachutes, but Nick is still onboard as it hits the ground. Everyone was killed in the crash, but Nick awakens in a morgue in Oxford a day later, Vail's ghost tells him he is cursed by Ahmanet, he will become a replacement vessel for Set, meanwhile Ahmanet's mummy awakens, escapes the sarcophagus and begins regenerating her decomposed body by feeding on rescue workers, who are turned into zombie minions. Ahmanet lures Nick and Jenny into a trap, surrounding them with minions to fight, they are unsuccessful trying to escape, Ahmanet also recovers the blade of the Dagger of Set, but at the last second, unknown soldiers appear and Ahmanet is subdued. The leader of the soldiers, Dr. Henry Jekyll (Razzie nominated Russell Crowe), explains that Jenny in an agent of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats, these are contained under the Natural History Museum of London, such discoveries include a webbed hand and a human skull with fangs. Dr. Jekyll confirms Nick was cursed when he unlocked the tomb, but the doctor wants to allow Ahmanet to complete her ritual and for Set to possess Nick, in order to destroy Set and end his evil forever, meanwhile Ahmanet is able to possess a Prodigium technician and release herself from captivity, wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in the process. Jekyll himself has dark impulses, Nick rejects his offer of an alliance, and takes his serum away, allowing Jekyll to transform into his murderous and psychotic alternate personality, Edward Hyde, Hyde attacks and nearly kills Nick, before he injects him with the serum, suppressing his evil side. Nick and Jenny escape from Prodigium, while Ahmanet steals back the dagger, she summons an army of deceased English crusaders to serve her, and creates a giant sandstorm to ravage London, the undead knights slaughter the Prodigium soldiers in the tomb, allowing Ahmanet to find the ruby for the dagger's pommel, which can free Set. Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground, Nick is guided by Vail, but Ahmanet's minions attack, Ahmanet captures and drowns Jenny, Nick fights back, but gives up and allows Ahmanet to seduce him, but this is a trick so he can steal the dagger and stab himself, Set possess his body and proceeds to uphold his end of the bargain with Ahmanet, but he sees Jenny's body, Nick regains control, and uses Set's power to suck the life out of Ahmanet, turning her back into a shrivelled mummy. Nick harnesses the powers also to resurrect Jenny, he says goodbye before becoming overwhelmed with Set's power and disappears, Jenny regroups with Dr. Jekyll, they discuss if Nick, now fused with Set, will succumb to Set's influence, Ahmanet's corpse is lowered and locked in a pool of mercury within Prodigium, and it ends with Nick, and Vail who has been resurrected, setting out on an adventure. Also starring Marwan Kenzari as Malik and Kill List's Neil Maskell as Dr. Whemple. Cruise is miscast, and as producer has made a bit of a shambles, Wallis (apparently the main star of the proposed series) is fine, Boutella is alright as the evil villainess, and Crowe is a bit up-and-down. The special effects department do their job, creating sequences with monsters and things falling apart, but that's really all the film is good for. It lacks substance, it has silly dialolgue and many cliches, and it tries too hard to be thrilling or scary. No wonder it didn't do well at the box office, and effectively any plans for the future franchise were scuppered, a disappointing just about watchable action adventure fantasy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Director for Alex Kurtzman and Worst Screenplay. Okay!",The Mummy
9,paul_haakonsen,Welcome to a new world of gods and monsters...,5,11 July 2017,"At first impression, I was thinking that this seemed like a very unnecessary reboot or remake, especially since the older version was actually adequate. But still, I decided to give it a chance, because it is a movie with mummies in it after all, and usually Tom Cruise stars in some relatively good movies.The make-up and special effects in the 2017 version of ""The Mummy"" were, of course, quite impressive, especially given the budget of the movie. I was rather impressed and entertained with the special effects and the particular type of visual path they opted for.""The Mummy"" was a tad too dark, and I don't mean in terms of a dark story or dark humor, but it was literally a dark movie, with many scenes shrouded in shadow and a general lack of adequate lighting. Sure, it added to the atmosphere of the movie. But I hate it when movies do that and keep most of the scenes shrouded in darkness. I pay to watch a movie, I don't pay to see shadowy silhouettes of what is going on and having to guess my way to the rest.Now, the mummy Ahmanet herself wasn't particularly impressive or scary. There was some good special effects when she was decayed and mummified, and it looked good when she was regenerating. But in overall, then it was a fairly weak approach that they had to an iconic character such as the mummy. I will say that the mummified servants that she made along the way actually looked rather interesting and had great effects, as did the skeletal crusaders. It was a step down the intellectual ladder when Ahmanet suddenly started to speak perfect English, after only having spoken ancient Egyptian throughout the movie up to the point of suddenly being fluent in English.The cast in ""The Mummy"" was good, and the reboot clearly survives primarily because of the big names that flourish on the cast list; that being Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, of course. Sofia Boutella did an adequate job, despite fighting an uphill battle as her character was generic, bland and downright anti-climatic.The obvious nods to Dracula/vampires and the creature from the Black Lagoon was a nice touch, so I assume the tie ins in this ""Dark Universe"" reboot might actually work out well enough for the better. I didn't know that Dr. Jekyll was a part of that universe, so it was a bit of a surprise when that name was dropped.The music score for the movie was quite good, and it was a very interesting and well-composed atmosphere and ambient that really fitted well to the movie.This 2017 version of ""The Mummy"" is rather unnecessary, just as I had anticipated it to be. But sure, it was still entertaining enough for what it turned out to be - a fast paced action adventure where you can disconnect your brain and just lean back and enjoy the ride. Don't expect anything grand or overly innovative from director Alex Kurtzman. A visually impressive movie that proves to be little more than a hollow reboot of an already well-functioning franchise. And it was also a rather predictable storyline, with no twists or surprises for the audience along the way.While it was entertaining enough, ""The Mummy"" is hardly a movie that you will watch more than a single time.",The Mummy
10,tavm,This new version of The Mummy was quite exciting to watch!,8,14 June 2017,"I'll admit right off the bat that I wasn't really as excited to watch this as my movie theatre-working friend was but this was quite an exciting movie to watch so, yeah, I enjoyed viewing it. I smiled, but not laughed, at some of the humorous wisecracks involving Tom Cruise and his leading lady before things took a turn concerning Cruise' character that permeated the rest of the movie. Russell Crowe also had some good scenes with what he does here. The last 30 minutes of non-stop action was pretty exciting. If the movie does well enough, I'd indeed be looking forward to the sequel. So on that note, me and my friend recommend this version of The Mummy.",The Mummy
11,Coventry,M:I - Mummy Impossible!,3,21 January 2020,"Did I read that right? Universal Studios is planning to remake all its legendary monster-movie classics from the 1930s in the next couple of years? ""The Mummy"" is only the first of a new series, and titles like ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" are already in production? As a fanatic admirer of old-fashioned horror stories, I know I'm supposed to feel enthusiastic. But as a cynical critic and a heavy adversary of CGI-effects, I just know the revival of this monster cycle will only result in fancy-looking but substantially void and boisterous action vehicles full of atrocious computer effects and popular actors that are hopelessly miscast. I went into watching ""The Mummy"" with an open mindset, but my fears nevertheless got confirmed rather quickly.The plot and screenplay are all over the place. Literally, in fact, as the film takes place in Iraq, Egypt and the London Underground. How can there possibly be Egyptian tombs in Iraq and London? Why is Dr. Jekyll investigating mummies and ancient Egyptian mysteries, even though he still hasn't found a remedy to permanently annihilate his evil alter ego Mr. Hyde? Why does Tom Cruise look more mummified than the real mummy? Cruise is more than 20 years older than his love-interest, but behaves like a spoiled and pimpled teenager most of the time. He depicts his characters as if he's starring in another installment in the ""Mission: Impossible"" or ""Jack Reacher"" franchise! The running gag with Tom Cruise's dead and gradually decaying buddy Vail is blatantly stolen from ""An American Werewolf in London"". On the positive side, I'm glad the titular monster is female, for a change. Princes Ahmanet definitely is one bad mother, and her background story at the beginning is easily the atmospheric and narrative highlight of the entire film. Admittedly there's a lot of violence, gore and special effects, but it's all computerized - as feared - and thus not the least bit unsettling or shocking. Even ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons, or those childish mummy flicks starring Brendan Fraser, looked scarier than this.Okay, I realize I sound like an old and embittered sourpuss here, so why don't I just board my time-capsule and send myself back to the 1930's?",The Mummy
12,michaelRokeefe,A typical Tom Cruise escapade,5,22 September 2020,"This is not your mommy's Mummy; not your grandmothers' unless she has a thing for Mr. Cruise. But no , there is no mummy roaming around with his wrappings dangling. And the action has you on a slow motion sand plow. Curise (Nick Morton) is a soldier of fortune plundering dig sites seeking gems to sell to the highest bidder. Accidentally unearthed is Ahmanet, (Sofia Boutella) a betrayed Egyptian princes who was entombed deep under the desert. The resurrected Ahmanet begins on a furious rampage in and around London. Morton intends to stop her. Cruise has his usual daredevil stunts. This may just not be the movie you expected.The cast also features Russell Crowe, Courtney B.

13,sunwarrior13,Arguably The Worst Tom Cruise Starrer I Have Ever Seen,2,14 October 2017,"After watching ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" a few months ago,I asked this question to myself: Is Tom Cruise approaching the period of downward slope of his extremely successful movie career? When I made the review for Jack Reacher,it was reported that the movie earned $160 million worldwide so I stated that he wasn't going down yet.But considering that his movies normally earned like $682 million world-wide for his latest Mission Impossible movie - Mission Impossible:Rogue Nation, I do believe that his movies should be placed in a different standard considering he is a megastar and on another level as a movie star.Then came ""The Mummy"" which was shown this year. Normally Tom Cruise movies are considered money earners and critically acclaimed.Too bad that this movie ""The Mummy"" isn't. Despite the fact that it earned $409 million worldwide and it earned $172 million on its opening day globally which happens to be a record for a Tom Cruise movie,it was critically thrashed and many critics saw it as a very poor movie.Before going to the review proper,let us discuss what ""The Mummy"" is all about.The new Tom Cruise movie is a reboot of ""The Mummy"" movie franchise and it is the first film made.It stars Cruise together with Annabelle Wallis,Sofia Boutella,Jake Johnson,Courtney B. Vance and Russell Crowe.This film directed by Alex Kurtzman tells the story of the Mummy,who has fascinated many cultures since the dawn of civilization.Apparently,the said creature is safely entombed deep beneath the unforgiving desert.Then an ancient princess led to its awakening that that brought with her malevolence grown over millennium and terrors that defy human comprehension.From the Middle East through modern-day London,the Mummy brings new intensity into the existing gods and monsters.Apparently,the critics thrashed this new movie franchise that Tom Cruise is in because it lacks fun and entertainment.Added to that,it was even considered worse as compared to previous movies of the previous ""The Mummy"" franchise which were also considered trash and unimpressive.Many also are not impressed with it and this new movie does not provide any new reason on why people should watch the reboot this time with Cruise in it.No question that this is actually the worst movie I have seen Tom since I saw him first in ""Top Gun"" three decades ago.No question that while Tom Cruise has remained a movie megastar,his movies will continue to earn money and people worldwide will continue to watch anything that he is on with his presence alone.But I must say that he is definitely reaching a point that he must start thinking about the future movies that he is going to make to continue becoming successful as a movie star being more than 50 years old and sustain moneymakers after three decades in Hollywood.It was obvious that his last two movies - ""Jack Reacher:Never Go Back"" and ""The Mummy"" - have become poorly rated movies and did not earn as much as his Mission Impossible movies that earned at least $600 million with Jack Reacher earning only $162 million and the first Mummy movie earning $409 million after the producers spent $120 million producing it.Compared to an ordinary movie star,they are still impressive.But for a star like Tom Cruise,who commands more than $20 million in salary and should be placed in another standard, they are not really impressive.It is about time for Tom Cruise and the producers to realize that his presence alone in movies is no longer enough for people to flock in theaters.Definitely,Tom Cruise must be in the right material for them to do so for they do care nowadays whether his films are good or not.",The Mummy
14,hitchcockthelegend,Disappointingly unoriginal and average.,5,29 October 2017,"So here we go, then, Universal begin their rebirth of the Universal Creature franchise (Dark Universe) with a crack at old bandage features, The Mummy, sadly the result is very average at best. You would think that with so many ""Mummy"" films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us, well, something new to gorge on, but what we actually get is a painfully familiar.From a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work, it's loud, rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage, but Cruise is going through the motions, Crowe is laughably miscast (with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery), while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects work.It's neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone, in fact it at times is very dull. There's also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures, a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled, whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancake.There's some nice touches, the ""Mummy"" design is sharp (love those eyes), a plane crash is exhilarating and the film's stand out sequence, and the tomb/prison design is neat, but after that you start to scratch around for positives, which in itself tells a story. At least it looks and sounds great in HD, the colours and sub-woofer shakes a treat for the senses.It's all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films, but the creators here make that inevitable. Lifting the plot from one of the 1940's films, and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making. It's unoriginal and as an opening salvo for a franchise it leaves Universal with a hell of a lot of work to do to make it work. 5/10",The Mummy
15,CinemaSerf,"Pretty banal all round, I am afraid.",5,5 December 2019,"This is pretty dreadful. This time it's a princess awakened after millennia to unleash a plague of unspeakable evil on mankind. I was trying to guess if it was supposed to be reincarnation (sorry!) of Karloff, Christopher Lee and/or Brendan Fraser - or is it just an attempt to be original as it flails around without any real direction save a heading for the inevitable conclusion as steadily as the RMS Titanic went for the iceberg. Tom Cruise is about as unlikely an hero in this film as it's possible to get; and he gets next to no support from his co-stars or the writers. It almost makes ""Great Wall"" look good.",The Mummy
16,utgard14,Unimpressive in every way,4,2 July 2017,"Universal's attempt at launching their own version of Marvel and DC's shared universe of superhero movies is off to a weak start. I guess this would be their second attempt at starting this idea since the previous Dracula Untold was supposed to be a part of it but has since apparently been removed from the continuity of whatever this is supposed to become. I think Universal would be better served by just trying to do good horror movies based around their classic monster characters rather than these action adventure movies. Yes, I liked the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies (the first one, at least), but that was a fresh idea then. Now they just look like they're copying themselves and doing a poor job of it. Make no mistake about it, this is a pretty generic movie with no special or unique qualities to brag about. Not one performance, scene, line, special effect will stay with you once this is over. It's just utterly routine in every way.If you enjoy Tom Cruise movies (and I often do), you might like this more than most because this is as Tom Cruise a performance as Tom Cruise can give. I'm disappointed by it, but I probably shouldn't be. This movie, and this whole shared universe idea, had disaster written all over it once they brought Alex Kurtzman on board. But I don't want this to turn into a rant so I'll leave my feelings on Kurtzman be. As a lifelong fan of the Universal monsters and as someone who frequently defends Tom Cruise movies, I was hopeful they could polish up this turd and give at least an entertaining movie on the level of the Fraser Mummy films, even though that's not the direction I personally feel they should have gone in. But this isn't entertaining. It's just a way to waste a hundred minutes of your life. Is it watchable? Sure. You probably won't storm out of the theater in a rage. That's the nicest thing I can say about it.",The Mummy
17,zardoz-13,"Nothiing Crummy About This ""Mummy""!!!",9,24 June 2017,"The latest incarnation of Universal Studios' classic horror chiller ""The Mummy"" doesn't deliver the same caliber of silly, scatterbrained shenanigans of the Victorian-Era, comedy of errors ""The Mummy,"" with Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah. Director Stephen Sommers' ""Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) amounted to a tongue-in-cheek homage to the sinister Boris Karloff/Christopher Lee accounts of that timeless tale of evil unwrapped. Comparatively, the new ""Mummy"" is neither grisly nor will it afflict you with ghoulish nightmares. ""People Like Us"" director Alex Kutzman and three scribes—""Jurassic Park's"" David Koepp, ""Jack Reacher's"" Christopher McQuarrie, and ""Burn's"" Dylan Kussman--provide audiences with plenty of action, a roller-coaster pace, and a shorter-than-average running time, ten minutes under two hours. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise stars as an amoral Indiana Jones opportunist in search of antiquities. The newest spin amounts to a careening joyride of spectacular set-pieces with surprises that veers erratically from giddy light-comedy to gritty light-horror. Some movies are remarkable from fade-in to fadeout without a single bad scene to mar them. This new ""Mummy"" racks up one memorable scene after another, but this breathless yarn begins to implode under the weight of its complex 'Dark Universe' scenario. Critics and audiences alike haven't embraced the spirit of this madcap melodrama that christens Universal Studios' efforts to forge their own cinematic horror universe. Marvel Comics/Disney and DC Comics/Warner Brothers have created universes for their respective phalanxes of superheroes so they can cross-over without stepping out-of-bounds. Unfortunately, ""The Mummy""—the opening gambit in Universal's Dark Universe—stumbled at the starting gate. Historically, Universal established its reputation back in the 1930s with its Golden Age supernatural creature features: ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Wolf Man,"" ""The Invisible Man,"" and ""The Mummy,"" later adding ""Creature from the Black Lagoon."" Ironically, Universal has appropriated Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" ostensibly a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer property, to cross-over with ""The Mummy."" Since Stevenson's story molders in the public domain, anybody can adapt it without fear of copyright infringement. Oscar winning actor Russell Crowe takes a peripheral role in ""The Mummy"" as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Basically, he constitutes the equivalent of a behind-the-scenes Bruce Wayne with deep pockets to do as he sees fit. Presumably, if the Dark Universe endures, we may learn more about enigmatic Dr. Jekyll's ambitions.""The Mummy"" begins with an Egyptian Prayer of Resurrection which states nobody really dies. Instead, they can be reincarnated. Whether this is derived from a genuine Egyptian prayer, it makes for a dramatic way to start a sinister saga like ""The Mummy."" Initially, you'd think a movie with such a title would occur in the land of the Pyramids. Instead, the new ""Mummy"" unfolds in modern-day Northern Iraq. Two U.S. Army ""long-range reconnaissance"" scouts, Nick Morton (Tom Cruise of ""Jack Reacher"") and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson of ""Let's Be Cops"") are pinned down by insurgents in a harrowing firefight. Vail blows his cool and calls in an airstrike. U.S. launched Hellfire air-to-surface missiles scare off their adversaries but explode a colossal crater in the terrain that has concealed an Egyptian tomb for centuries. Predictably, their cantankerous commanding officer, Colonel Greenway (Courtney B. Vance of ""Terminator Genisys""), reprimands them for their suspicious sortie a hundred miles away from the enemy. Archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis of ""X-Men: First Class"") chastises Nick for stealing her map after a one-night stand. Greenway orders the guys and gal down into the cavern. They discover the tomb of a notorious Egyptian princess, Ahmanet (seductive Sofia Boutella of ""Star Trek Beyond""), whose life and legend was thought erased from history. The only daughter of an anonymous Pharaoh, Ahmanet trained night and day to prepare herself for the throne until her father married a handmaiden and sired a male heir. Refusing to sacrifice her inheritance, Ahmanet not only murdered the infant male, but she also slashed the throats of both the Pharaoh and his wife. Ultimately, for her treachery, she was cursed and buried alive thousands of miles from her native land. Our heroes hoist her sarcophagus out by helicopter, load it aboard a C-130 Hercules, and fly it back to Europe. Along the way, Vail suffers miserably from a poisonous camel spider bite and turns into a zombie. He stabs Colonel Greenway to death after take-off. Nick shoots him three times, and Vail collapses. Just when they imagine everything has returned to normal, thousands of crows collide with the C-130. Nick manages to strap Jenny into a parachute as the plane loses both altitude and engines. Nick rides the Hercules down as it crashes outside of London. Nevertheless, unlike the other ill-fated mortals aboard, Nick survives the tragedy. Pronounced dead on arrival, he awakens alive and kicking in a body bag. Nick cannot understand what has happened. Neither can he fathom those bizarre visions where Princess Ahmanet cavorts with him in the Sahara Desert. The new ""Mummy"" resembles a breathless Indiana Jones escapade. Nick and Jenny team up to track down Ahmanet. They learn Ahmanet wants a wicked ceremonial dagger of Set with a ruby in the handle that an English Crusader Knight stole when he liberated it during the Second Crusade. Princess Ahmanet is a coldblooded sorceress who must recover that dagger with the ruby intact. Tattooed from head to toe with hieroglyphs, this ashen-skinned wench emerges as a titan of terror. She runs amok around England, searching for the Crusader Knight's tomb, when she isn't sucking the life out of innocent bystanders like the female vampire in ""Lifeforce"" (1985). Moreover, she plans to sacrifice Nick to resurrect her dead lover Set, the God of Evil. Like an Indiana Jones' epic, our hero and heroine leap through one flaming hoop into another to defeat this dame. Cruise seems more sympathetic than usual because she has cursed him. Russell Crowe's Henry Jekyll enters the picture and recaptures Ahmanet, but he professes sinister designs of his own. ""The Mummy"" is a far cry from crummy!",The Mummy

While the committee-by-command screenplay cobbled by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, Dylan Kussman, Jon Spaihts, Lenny Lumet and director Alex Kurtzman (who employs some of the previous franchise's reboot of CGI skulduggery to the nth degree of bloat) attempts to mix mirth with menace (with mixed results at best), Cruise continues to control the proceedings at hand including an ill-fitting Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll (as in Mr. Hyde - the worst on screen visualize conception by the way since Spencer Tracy's wild mugging of the past).",The Mummy
20,neil-476,Resoundingly average,7,9 May 2018,"An underground discovery in London leads to an ancient Egyptian flashback introducing duplicitous princess Ahmanet and her efforts to give death god Set physical form. We then move to present day Iraq, where mildly crooked Nick and sidekick Vail discover Ahmanet's tomb. Hot archaeologist Jenny determines that this is a prison. Ahmanet manages to escape, and also kills and revives Nick as a receptacle for Set. An organisation called Prodigium - effectively monster hunters - gets involved before everything goes to hell in a handbasket.Universal had a long run in the 1940s featuring most of the classic movie monsters, and they still hold the rights to them. They intend to create a Dark Universe bringing back modern versions. Despite a couple of false starts, The Mummy is the first solid entry.The story doesn't hold any huge shocks - Mummy preserved, Mummy discovered and goes back to work, efforts to defeat Mummy - but there are a couple of moments which are nice surprises. If you manage to avoid character lists, Russell Crowe's character comes as a surprise, for instance. And what happens at the end isn't what I was expecting. Although the film resolves satisfactorily, there are threads which can be picked up in future films.Annabelle Wallis' Jenny should have been the lynchpin for this, and future, films. She is feisty, intelligent, but realistically scared when supernatural happenings start. However, Tom Cruise's star muscle overwhelms her. Unfortunately, Nick is written unsympathetically before his expected character change kicks in. It is difficult to like him initially. The Cruise charm does eventually work its magic, however. Russell Crowe has huge fun as the head honcho of Prodigium. But Sofia Boutella stole the film for me. Although she has far too little to do, Ahmanet physically commands every scene she is in, and many in which she is not.I've heard criticisms of the effects: to me they seemed OK. Maybe the sandstorm-type effects weren't 100% convincing. The desert locations were spectacular, the London locations were, well, London. The sets did their job, without being showyIt's not especially scary. There is no bad language. In many ways, it's quite a family-friendly ""horror"" film though less so than the Brendan Fraser version. And I found it entertaining. It's a matter of taste, though - if a film only has 2 viewers, it is guaranteed that one will love it, the other will hate it.And what of the Dark Universe? It all depends on box office. If The Mummy does well, then I imagine there will be at least one further instalment. If Cruise's star puts less bums on seats than usual, then who knows?",The Mummy
21,AlsExGal,What a dumpster fire of a film!,3,24 November 2018,"This is no real CGI extravaganza with bombastic effects, and it has no final battle. But at the same time it's not a dark somber thriller on the verge of horror, and also it's not really an action-adventure with funny quips. It's also not a low-mid budget monster hunting action-thriller.This movie is a rushed Frankenstein monster, you can clearly see that. It starts with an action-adventure vibe with jokes and snarky characters, then it suddenly turns into a pg-13 horror-thriller and then to a monster horror then into a disaster movie and then into some kind of dark drama but then comes back into the same beginning with jokes and quips. I can easily imagine producers telling the writers ""Just make it happen, the charts say people want this, this and this! Don't worry about it, they will eat it up.""The problem with this movie (goes for all similar ones) is that it is supposed to be the first movie in a Cinematic Universe. But! They do things in a way much different from Marvel. They want to create what Marvel created, but Marvel made movies which could stand on their own. You could basically start to watch Iron-Man 2 and you wouldn't really feel like you do not understand it at all. Or even Iron-Man 3 (which is after Avengers!).But going into this movie, you are force fed that this is a cinematic universe. You are introduced to so many characters which are obviously supposed to have bigger story arcs in later movies, and in all of that cinematic universe introduction, there is some random Mummy plot thrown into the mix, so that something could hold all of these loose ends together. There are just too many unanswered questions, and too many seemingly random characters. It feels like you are already watching some later movie, maybe the 5th one in this whole cinematic universe, and this one just happens to have a mummy in it.Caution: Do not turn this film in to a drinking game where you take a shot every time you miss Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. You'll be dead in twenty minutes. I give this film three points for technical competence and for Sofia Boutella as an awesome female mummy.",The Mummy
22,Uriah43,An Action-Packed Mummy Film,5,11 December 2017,"While scrounging for priceless artifacts in parts of Iraq, a U.S. Army sergeant by the name of ""Nick Morton"" (Tom Cruise) and his friend ""Corporal Chris Vail"" (Jake Johnson) accidentally stumble upon the sarcophagus of an Egyptian princess named ""Ahmanet"" (Sophia Boutella). Although all he wants are things he can easily carry with him, his hopes are dashed when he is discovered by an archaeologist by the name of ""Jenny Halsey"" (Annabelle Wallis) who just happens to be accompanied by Nick Morton's military superiors. To that end, she insists that the military transports the sarcophagus to England for further evaluation. Of course, what none of them count on is the fact that this is no ordinary mummy within the sarcophagus and that Ahmanet has plans for Nick which include not only conquering the world but immortality as well. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay film which could have been much better if it had followed the standard mummy outline rather than deviating into a fast-paced action film. Quite frankly, like too many films produced today it had too much action and CGI and not enough suspense or horror-and not even the presence of Tom Cruise or all of the millions of dollars spent on marketing could save it from mediocrity. That said, while this certainly wasn't a bad movie by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",The Mummy
23,Wizard-8,Best kept under wraps by all concerned,3,3 August 2019,"When this movie first came out on DVD and Blu-Ray, Universal Pictures did their best to try and urge people to buy it, saying, ""Won't be on Netflix for years!"" Well, I just watched this on Netflix, but I estimate about 24 or so months had passed since the announcement, so technically ""years"" have passed. Anyway, I thought this attempt by the studio to start their announced ""Dark Universe"" movie genre was an inauspicious start, to put it mildly. I guess some of the special effects are passable, and there are a few short bursts of okay action. But the movie's few merits are bogged down by its many shortcomings. One big problem I had with the movie is that there is far too much comic relief. Some comic relief would have been okay, but the movie not only goes overboard with it, it's not particularly funny to begin with. This overabundance of humor may be why a badly miscast Tom Cruise seems befuddled and unsure of what tone to play his character. Not only that, he and the rest of the cast are burdened with a script that simply does not make any of their characters interesting or worth caring about. In the end, the movie makes the Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies seem like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in comparison, and it's no surprise that Universal has apparently put the Dark Universe franchise on hold.",The Mummy

When Nick and his partner come under attack in the Middle East, the ensuing battle accidentally unearths Ahmanet, a betrayed Egyptian princess who was entombed under the desert for thousands of years. With her powers unleashed and constantly evolving, Morton must now stop the resurrected monster as she embarks on a furious rampage through the streets of London, and destroying a fair few landmarks on her way.....Slow down Tom.....It's true, The Mummy has probably made Universal put a 'wrap' for the second time on their proposed 'Dark Universe', but for a failure, it's highly entertaining trash, in the vein of The League Of Extraordinary Gentleman, Hudson Hawk, and the recent King Arthur film.These are the type of films that by just seeing the trailer, you have that incline that the film will not be as big as the studio wants it to be.Their first Mis-step is having Cruise as the lead. It takes focus on the world that Universal are trying to build. Cruise is arguably the biggest star on the planet, and no matter what you think about his personal life, his films entertain, and for some reason, this feels so wrong for him, even though he's good in his role as Nick.But really when you think about it, all he does is run away from special effects or Pyrotechnics, so if you have a fetish for seeing Cruise run, this could be you new favourite film. He also shows again that he has some really effortless comic timing, especially the scene in the church after the ambulance chase.Russell Crowe pops up as Basil Exposition, explaining to Cruise why he survived the best set piece of the film (and it's not because it's in the first act), and is almost like a Gothic TV game show host, explaining to the audience that this is the first of many films.It's not scary in the slightest, it uses cattle prod orchestral manoeuvres to make you jump, which gets really annoying very quickly.But it's a spectacular mess, both wonderfully bizarre, and bizarrely wonderful in the same instance.But one feels that this will be a damp squib of a year for big films, with regurgitated sequels, a re-re boot, another franchise killer, in the form of Arthurian legend.But there have been some spectacular turkeys this year, and along with The Great Wall, I am proud to say that I enjoyed this for all the wrong reasons.Worth seeing, but this will be a cult film in years to come.",The Mummy

The producers flirted with the idea of ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) being part of the Dark Universe, and the epilogue of that movie set in the modern world suggested this, but the idea was dropped. While ""The Mummy"" garnered $410 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted it.I found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s-40s of the previous trilogy; it prevented it from being the same-old-same-old. I also didn't mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt, e.g. northern Iraq and England; even Hammer's version from 1959 started in Egypt, but quickly moved to England. I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing. So the flick gets points for NOT being one-dimensional and hackneyed.I enjoyed it for the most part, although it coulda been more compelling in the latter portions. It has the same spirit of high adventure of the 1999 movie mixed with gothic horror (including creepy zombies) and a bit o' comedy, but not too much. While the curious inclusion of Dr. Jekyll (Crowe) smacked of pushing the new franchise, it didn't ruin the viewing experience.

Why director Alex Kurtzman agreed to take on this hodgepodge of a film stretches the imagination.

28,zetes,"Dare I say, not that bad really?",7,26 June 2017,"It definitely has a lot of flaws and it can feel like a generic Hollywood blockbuster at times, but it's fairly competent and has some good action. It has two major problems right up front: 1) this is supposed to be the start of Universal's new ""Dark Universe"" shared universe, dredging up its classic monsters for the studio's version of Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. This doesn't exactly sound like a good idea, especially with these being action movies and not horror flicks. 2) Tom Cruise stars, Tom Cruise has creative control and he wants it to be another Tom Cruise movie. Tom Cruise! Just had to say it once more to satisfy Tom Cruise's ego. This is also just a bad way to start a new franchise, especially one in which Tom Cruise is probably not going to pop up in every future installment. ""Tom Cruise movie"" is just not the way to go with the initial film in your franchise. So, yeah, this film definitely has elements at odds with each other. It still kind of works, in my opinion. Tom Cruise is certainly getting past his sell-by date and I think another star may have worked better, but he's not bad and he can still do action stuff, like the thrilling plane crash showed prominently in the trailers and the many, many chase sequences. The monsters are pretty decent, too. Nothing you haven't seen before, but pretty cool, jerky undead monsters. And Sofia Boutella is quite good as the main villain. Jake Johnson is also kind of fun as Cruise's sidekick, often used for comic relief. As a huge fan of Johnson from New Girl, I love seeing him in these movies even if he doesn't belong. Russell Crowe is also very good as, well, it's easy enough to see on the IMDb page but let's just say he's the major expansion of the Dark Universe in this film. Annabelle Wallis isn't bad as the lead actress, but she doesn't have all that much to do. My major gripes with the film are its clunky opening exposition and especially the way it ends, which is just kind of confusing. Obviously it was going to end going towards a sequel / the expanded universe, but I could have used a bit more info here.

But a bit later it's again all action packed.The effects used were amazing especially the possession or even zombiefied in stead of mummified victims.

Well acted Cruse never has a weak performance. Crowe's acting/narration style captivates the audience. Wallis is a strong supporting actress, who guides a lost lead character through the unknown. The director keeps a fast entertaining pace. What did not work: Cruse becomes a zombie fighter aka The Walking dead. The concept is getting old because of the zombie T V series. When The Mummy story-line hits the secret compound the story could be a mystery, but a regrettably but turns into anther formulated super hero movie. The Mummy's strongest character Crowe (who just shines) is not in enough scenes. The ending is a predictable all ends tie up with the flawed hero concept.

Another positive point is that it's not a remake of the first movie. It's a total different story and that's always good because I don't see the point of remakes. But the negative parts are like I said a majority. Russell Crowe isn't a great actor and in this movie it shows. The story line is weak and that because of the over-exaggerations all the time.

I also liked the 1999 Mummy movie, where Frasier was a forgettable hero, kind of like Cruise here, but I really enjoyed Arnold Vosloo's performance despite the lackluster script.And in the end this is what makes this mummy film just as mediocre, the script. It's attempting to jumpstart a Dark Universe franchise much like Ahmanet resurrects dead people, as incomplete soulless zombies. There is no flesh in it, just bones and rotten cliché. I mean, even Cruise was probably cast in this because he played much the same character in Edge of Tomorrow, a vastly superior film, BTW.I don't think Universal realizes that their biggest competitor is a British TV show called Penny Dreadful that was better than what they can ever do in movies and still was cancelled.Bottom line: I enjoyed it.

This film has Tom Cruise battling an evil ancient princess, that he awakens from her mummified state (buried beneath the desert in a crypt). The movie also stars Sofia Boutella, Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson and Russell Crowe. It was directed and co-produced by Alex Kurtzman (who also co-wrote 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III', also starring Cruise) and it was written by David Koepp, Dylan Kussman and Christopher McQuarrie (who's also worked with Cruise multiple times before). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also underperformed at the domestic Box Office. I'm pretty disappointed with it as well.Two American soldiers (Cruise and Johnson), serving time in Iraq, unwittingly unearth an ancient princess (Boutella), buried beneath the Iraqi desert in a crypt (by calling in an airstrike). They're then assigned to assist an archaeologist (Wallis), that one of them previously had an affair with, investigate the newly discovered crypt. While investigating it, they also awaken the mummified princess (of course). The soldiers are also then cursed by the evil mummy, and then forced into an otherworldly adventure like nothing they've ever been through before.The film has some decent effects in it, and a few cool mummy fight scenes. Cruise is also (like usual) a great action hero in it as well. Other than that though, the movie is mostly forgettable. I love monster flicks too, so I really wanted to like it. There are definitely a few thrills here and there, but they're mostly forgettable. I hope the next Dark Universe film is a lot better than this one, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/KR0HDeT91m0",The Mummy
34,thesar-2,An American Mummy in London,4,12 August 2017,"Was the World really asking for a remake of Suicide Squad, so soon?Kidding aside, that's not a bad ideaFirst, the horror. Then, the slapstick adventure. Nowthe action? Personally, if they wanted to reboot the Universal Monsters of the long- distance past, I believe I don't stand alone as disappointed they didn't return to its roots: horror. Fine, there are horror elements here. But, the same you would find in any Indiana Jones adventure, i.e. family-friendly.A military thief stumbles upon an ancient evil and becomes the chosen one to rule the Earth in darkness, I suppose. The motivations were fairly vague and the entire operation could've been concluded 5,000 years prior if this evil princess mummy had just killed her (half?) brother in secret to gain her power back. Yeah, every movie has its plot holes, but this one was pretty big. The princess is in line to inherit the 3,000 BC equivalent of billions, but is thwarted when her daddy has a son who, in turn, would get the fortune and power because, well, male. Instead of doing the obvious: killing her only roadblock to the rich and famous lifestyle, she makes a pact with the devil and kills her daddy and (half?) brother. Too little, too late.I digress. Because of the crimes she chose not to hide, she's mummified until today's time and is after the thief to bring the devil to life. The good: the action and sets were pretty good. Nothing wildly original, but enjoyable. That part of the movie was SOOO Tom Cruise. The bad: the said motivations, the incredible letdown of Mr. Hyde's lame appearance and a real lack of threat to all mankind. Hell, even the enormously similar Suicide Squad had higher stakes.Backing up, as mentioned, this movie has Tom Cruise all over it and was both a blessing and curse. I AM a Cruise fan, most notably for his Mission: Impossible films (namely 3-5,) Edge of Tomorrow and A Few Good Men, just to name a few of the many I love. But, here he brought his latest and highly entertaining action pieces to a movie that didn't warrant it. If they were trying to actually reboot the Brendan Fraser series, I can see the need for the action/adventure scenes, but they left out the slapstick fun and heart, not to mention a strong and deep female lead. (Oh, I forgot, this female half-of-Cruise was just plain awful.) Again, I wish they would've rebooted the original and stick with just plain horror.It's not necessarily a bad film, but in no way was it a very good one. It works and I pray that both: they continue this ""Dark Universe"" with the other Universal classics and that Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde had his one and only appearance.***Final thoughts: 1) I have heard they're remaking An American Werewolf in London, as well. Consider this movie and one of its main themes a preboot. 2) I haven't seen the original since I was a little one. I remember thinking it wasn't too scary, probably because the Mummy was so slow and yet everyone just stood around waiting for those hands to plant around their necks and strangle them. I have, however, recently bought the 1999 rebooted series in a Bluray boxset and revisited them all. While not perfect, they were 10x better than this movie. So, without revisiting the original (or its inevitable sequels) I just recommend sticking with the Brendan Fraser takes. So much more fun.",The Mummy

After all, many of the reviews said it was inferior to the 1999 Mummy, but at the time that very excellent movie got it's share of pans. The Mummy begins with a scene set in ancient Egypt. The mood was too glum and serious for something with the campy knife-wielding naked lady trope, but a lot of good action movies start with a dumb hundreds-of- years-ago scene, so I was only a little worried.Then we transition to the modern age, with Tom Cruise playing a soldier who freelances as an antiquities thief who also robbed his antiquities-authority one-night-stand (in traditional Hollywood style, no need is felt to have any middle-eastern characters in a movie about middle-eastern antiquities). It's a weirdly unsympathetic role for an action movie hero, which may be why the movie, after having him act really stupid for a while, starts making him a nice, pretty noble guy without dealing with all his horrific character flaws. The movie soon becomes quite disjointed, as though the producers wrote down a bunch of action scenes - car chase with mummies, underwater scene with mummies, building disintegrating in the wake of a supernatural being - and then wrote transitions based on scenes from other movies (pretty much everything in this movie is derivative).What makes it worse is the action scenes are lifeless. The direction is flat and the lack of character development makes it hard to care if anyone lives or dies.There are a couple of surprising turns in the movie. While you'll know how it ends before it ends, you probably won't guess where it's going earlier, because it's too stupid to consider. In the same way, a certain fictional doctor is a surprise, but one that comes completely out of left field.I considered giving up on this movie about a half hour in, but two things kept me watching. One was the vain hope that once all the early stupidity was pushed out of the way there'd be some decent action. The other was that I just kind of wanted to see how many different terrible ideas could be poorly crammed into one movie. Ultimately, that is the main reason to watch this movie; just to see how a movie shouldn't be made.",The Mummy
36,FeastMode,my notes,4,24 July 2019,"One REALLY amazing action sequence. other than that this movie was meh. couldn't keep me into it. most of the other action was pretty useless. a lot of him running, and some really weak fights. the special effects were great. the comedy was mostly misses. the guy who plays nick in new girl was pretty annoying for the most part. and i really like him in new girl. although i hated let's be cops. most of the jokes fell flat. and the tone was so inconsistent. the first action scene in the movie makes you think this is going to be a fun, not meant to be taken seriously kind of movie. but then it tries to get really serious and dark and it just doesn't work.

37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Not that bad, but not that good either.",6,11 May 2018,"After an opening expository dump in which the dulcet tones of Russell Crowe almost send us to sleep, 'The Mummy (2017)' introduces us to our protagonist with a scene that seems ripped straight out of Michael Bay's 'Transformers' (over-saturated orange explosions and all). The flick then settles into its own odd mix of over-blown action, broad comedy (that rarely lands on both feet but also rarely annoys) and darkly-lit horror. Incidentally, it's the 'scary' moments which work the best, though the amount of horror in relation to everything else isn't balanced too well. The piece is mostly trite, the story being stupid schlock worthy of many a sigh right until it's semi-open ending - which is almost certain to leave you rolling your eyes - but I can't deny that I had some fun in a 'B-movie' kind of way. It isn't badly filmed, either, with some decent cinematography and relatively convincing visual effects. I think its been put through the wringer slightly too harshly, as there are plenty films worse than this released in 2017 alone, but you can see why audiences would start to be tired of studio mandated movies made only to kick-start 'cinematic universes' with little thought to their quality or underlying passion. It's not terrible, though, and probably worth a watch once if this is your kind of thing, but it isn't as good as most of the previous 'Mummy' titles either. 6/10",The Mummy
38,bowmanblue,"Not as bad as people make out, but I can see why it failed",7,12 June 2019,"Wouldn't it be great to see Iron Man fight it out with Captain America? Of course it would! And it was! Which is just one reason that 'shared universes' are so popular (and financially successful!) these days. I'm guessing that the film studio 'Universal Pictures' saw the success Disney was having with their superhero movies and thought they'd do a bit of 'shared universe' creating. Only with old monsters. And lo the 'Monsterverse' was born. And, after 2017's 'The Mummy,' it's pretty much as dead as its titular star. Shame really.Despite having mega-star Tom Cruise as the lead, 'The Mummy' bombed at the Box Office. I didn't watch it at the cinema, but I was well aware that it didn't make enough money to guarantee the various other movies the studio were planning, i.e. all those others with 'classic' monsters such as Frankenstein and the Invisible Man etc.However. now I've seen it on DVD I actually quite liked it. It's certainly not as bad as many make out and yet the reasons it flopped are all apparent. First of all, if it just did its best to tell a story then it might be a lot 'tighter.' As it was, it spends a great deal of time giving us - the audience - a hell of a lot of backstory and exposition as to the 'world' the characters are living in. It's about two hours long and I'd say that every quarter of an hour, the story grinds to a halt in order to one character to drone on about something which could have been cut, but has only been included because it relates to films that haven't even been made yet.Secondly, 'The Mummy' was already made in 1999, starring Brendon Fraser. Yes, many argued that it was a 'poor man's Indiana Jones' rip-off. And they'd be right. However, it was just so damn fun that many people seemed to forgive the likeness and just enjoy munching popcorn to it. Plus, despite being released about twenty years ago, its special effects have aged well and hold up just fine when compared to this new version. In short... the audience had its 'Mummy' film and we didn't really want another one so similar so soon.But, saying all that, I did enjoy what was there. Tom Cruise has proven himself time and time again that's he's more than capable of carrying a film on his shoulders and he does that here (even if he does take more punishment than all his 'Mission Impossible' films put together and still get up again without so much as a bruise!). He has a 'love interest' who I will call 'love interest.' Not the actress' fault. She does her best with what's there, but is only really there for Tom to save. Russell Crowe pops up as 'Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde' to (a) deliver exposition and (b) you guessed it... set up his own film in the universe. The real star is the mummy herself. Sofia Boutella smoulders (sometimes literally!) as the villain of the piece and can even manage to upstage Tom himself when she hisses her way on screen.Overall, if you like Tom Cruise and you're into anything from big budget action films to supernatural, er, action films (yes, there's plenty of action - some good CGI and some not so good) it's worth a watch, especially now it's on DVD and you can skip the bits that are basically 'filler' for what was meant to come, but probably never will now.",The Mummy
39,ThomasDrufke,Dull Start to the Dark Universe,5,9 June 2017,"We now live in a world where a movie about Aunt May was considered as a Spider-Man spin off by Sony at one point, as just about every studio is desperate to create their own shared cinematic universe. Universal's 'Dark Universe' sounded like a fascinating idea (and to some extent still does), but The Mummy is definitely nowhere near the opening act Universal hoped for when deciding to kick-off the series a few years ago.'The Mummy' actually has far more scares than I thought, but also far fewer high-octane action scenes than one would come to expect from a Tom Cruise led film. In reality, the movie lies somewhere in the middle of an action-horror, and that's where the film's flaws tend to reveal themselves. Although Universal has been planning this universe for years, it doesn't seem like they knew the right tone to set for the set of films. I realize going the rated R route would be a bigger risk financially, but I think there could have been more done creatively instead. Why make a Mummy film if it's just going to be a safe action thriller with nothing new to add to the lore?Alex Kurtzman, who has done some great work in both writing and producing in the past, was given a big task with directing The Mummy as his second feature film. He's not entirely to blame for the blandness of the script and direction, but he certainly didn't add anything refreshing to the long running franchise. In fact, pretty much every aspect of this film is just okay. But that isn't the type of film you should lead your entire franchise with. You should come out wanting to see more from the universe. I'm not opposed to seeing films like The Bride of Frankenstein, The Creature of the Black Lagoon, Dracula, or The Invisible Man, but they need to re-establish a more fitting tone going forward.The cast is likable, as expected. Sofia Boutella continues her streak of blockbuster success (after Kingsman & Star Trek) and does well as the creepy and seductive titular character. Annabelle Wallis is serviceable as a scientist of sorts to Dr. Jekyll's (Russel Crowe) Prodigium. And Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. The only character I felt to be out of place was Chris Vail played by Jake Johnson. He always seemed to be popping up at the wrong place and wrong time in this movie. Perhaps proposed as a comedic relief character, Vail's comedy never lands, and I hardly think it was because of Johnson's acting.Overall, I think The Mummy is a missed opportunity for Universal and their hopes of a new universe. With nothing new to add, grim tone, and a bland story, The Mummy isn't the beginning to Dark Universe I had hoped.+Acting-Tone-Dull5.0/10",The Mummy
40,MLDinTN,Tom Cruise has just lost IT,5,27 March 2018,"Whatever Tom Cruise had that made him a big star is basically gone. He just doesn't have IT. I think a lot of people are turned off because of the whole sciencetology thing with him. Any ways, he plays some army dude stealing ancient artifacts in the middle east. That doesn't even make sense. Anyways, they find a tomb of a cursed Egyptian queen whom turned evil. He's the chosen since he cut the rope, causing her tomb to be found. They take the tomb back to Europe and she causes the plane to crash where this cursed dagger is hidden. Nick (Cruise) dies but comes back to life and his body is in perfect condition. So him and the archiologist Jenny come across the evil Queen and her dead servants. The queen is captured in a silly way because you could not do that to something super natural. Any ways, Nick is taken to the guy in charge, Dr. Jekyll. What, since when did Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde show up in a Mummy film. So weird. So of course there is a late fight and Nick must become the chosen and then easily defeats the queen. How is that he is so much more powerful than her. Did not make sense. Any ways, it ended set up for a sequel, but it didn't do that well, so who knows if it will get made.FINAL VERDICT:Silly, but ok special effects. Teens will probably like it.",The Mummy
41,Cineanalyst,"Run, Tom, Run",3,2 October 2018,"""Dracula Untold"" (2014), the previous misstep in the launch of the Dark Universe, was an utter debasement of its monster's literary heritage in favor of remaking the bloodsucker as a kind of Dark Knight, in the image of another Batman, the comic-book superhero, but, of course, with the enviable success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in mind. But, at least it was somewhat character driven. This ""Mummy,"" on the other hand, is star driven, and they selected the most action-intense movie star out there to lead the way, Tom Cruise. He runs, CGI stuff happens, and he runs some more. The benefit of ""The Mummy"" franchise is that it's a cinematic invention, starting with Universal's first 1932 iteration starring Boris Karloff, so it can be anything; there's no novel to be held account to, just a lot of conveniently semi-mysterious Ancient Egyptian history. Jekyll and Hyde, based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Gothic horror novella, is another beast, but this movie doesn't concern itself much with that, and so this new start for the Dark Universe continues the literary debasement. And, for what? For a kind of Dark Knight remaking of the monsters into comic-book superheros, with the success of the MCU in the back of the mind, again. It's no wonder that the failure is repetitive if they keep doing the same thing over again.Character motivations are very thin, even for the Egyptian mummy, despite her elaborate and repetitively-played backstory, she's essentially just evil and power hungry. Cruise's Nick Morton is an adventurist, but Jenny--it's hilarious that running Tom's love interest shares the name with that of Forrest Gump's--tells him there's a good man in him. Jenny's just here for Nick, and Dr. Henry Jekyll is just here to establish the shared cinematic universe and to do a lot of exposition and foreshadowing. Lots of talking. Cruise dutifully tries to listen, but he looks like he's got ants in his pants, always anticipating the next action scene--at one point while listening to Russell Crowe's Jekyll, he looks like he's preparing to be interviewed by Oprah or something. Regardless, Nick will repeat this information in his head later, as he also just does what Jenny told him to do, as Cruise does his one-note movie star thing.""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003) and, to an extent, ""Van Helsing"" (2004) also tried to remake Jekyll and Hyde into a comic-book superhero or villain. In those cases, he was similar to Marvel's the Hulk--a scientist who became a giant enraged monster from time to time. That had nothing to do with Stevenson's novella, either, which is about a man who loses control to a kind of drug addiction and shapeshifts into another appearance to entertain his repressed perversities. That's not who movie star Crowe is, though, either. He's a star who can do a lot of intense talking and even throw in a few jokes, but who has a serious anger problem if he doesn't take his meds. Crowe's Hyde isn't even significantly distinguishable in appearance from his Jekyll, although they have different fingerprints somehow. If this Hyde committed the crimes in Stevenson's book, everyone would've known it was Jekyll from the start--rendering the character pointless, in other words.Some of the CGI-packed action scenes are rather entertaining, to be fair. I thought the underwater sequence was especially intense, and I probably would've enjoyed the airplane one more had I not already seen practically the entire thing in the trailers already. But, the repetition of Tom running, saving damsel-in-distress Jenny and fighting monsters from mummy to mummy's zombie horde to Hyde is tiresome. Moreover, it's not just a disservice to the literary legacy of horror, but also to Universal's own classic monster movies, no matter the quoting of the ""Gods and Monsters"" line from Dr. Pretorius. Haphazardly, Universal managed to create cinema's first shared universe with their 1940s monster rallies that, while not great films, were better than this--beginning with ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943). At least, they were character driven, had atmosphere and, while frustratingly inconsistent at times, were more faithful to the legacies of their monsters than this.While spared an MCU-inspired after-credits scene, the end credits do begin with a bunch of Easter eggs for other monsters. And watch the ending of ""The Mummy"" and watch the ending of ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) again. It's shameless how much this film rips it off. Sure, the story particulars are a bit different, but it's the same tone: the derivative music, editing and speech inflection. This is not the hero we need right now, and it's not the one we deserve, either.",The Mummy
42,ericstevenson,Two pupils aren't cool,3,14 June 2017,"Well, it's sad to say that this is the movie that I spent most of that gift card on to watch. Then again, it's probably better this way because I still won't technically have wasted any money on it. I admit to not caring much for the Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies. They're just kind of meh. This one is total crap with how uninspired it is. None of this makes sense. There's one scene where Tom Cruise's friend tells him that he's angered the gods but later she doesn't believe in the gods! The plot is way too simple. A mummy is coming back and using Tom Cruise as a vessel to create a god.That's really it. There's an amusing line or two but it's pointless. Why is Dr. Jekyll in this movie? Oh wait, according to other reviews, they're trying to make a cinematic universe out of this. At least the DCCU struck gold with ""Wonder Woman"". Don't worry, this is still better than the awful Uwe Boll movies I've been watching. You think there's going to be a big climax with a mummy army, but there isn't.

44,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Dummy,5,13 June 2017,"What were Universal thinking putting out an exceptionally poor product such as this from an inexperienced director known mostly for mechanical scripts? This movie is a lesson in how NOT to do virtually everything.Tom Cruise is a woefully miscast here. This is not a character that fits him and this is not a genre he belongs in at all. It seems that Universal just rushed this nonsense into production as soon as he signed up without painstakingly planning it in advance. If this is supposed to be the first of a shared universe they could not possibly have started it off with a worse movie than this.The Brendan Fraser Mummy movies were fun adventures with mild horror and a sense of high escapism. They were tightly directed and attractively shot with scores by Goldsmith and Silvestri that even managed to generate their very own successful low-brow spin-off series. Universal already had their shared Mummy universe.This one...ugh! Besides Cruise being miscast I will stick to just two huge problems we have to suffer with this 2017 reboot. First of all the script is one of THE absolute worst examples of modern movie writing. Even worse than anything Lindelof has done. The dialogue is so head-bangingly poor that it defies belief. In my review of Alien: Covenant I said that the dialogue was so bad that it made the earliest of Scooby-Doo episodes look like Masterpiece Theatre. I thought that Alien: Covenant might represent the worse of the dialogue that might offend my ear drums this year. Sadly, no. The Mummy is EVEN WORSE. Many scenes are assembled with appalling voice-overs explaining what we are seeing. We don't need this. A competent director would use a visual narrative to guide the audience. Even Paul Anderson is capable of this. Not Kurtzman. He is so unable to bring this movie to life (pun intended) that he feels the need to turn the descriptive words into actual dialogue in case we are not smart enough to get it.Newsflash! Audiences do not like being condescended to. If you treat us like we are stupid you will not get a favorable response.There is also the possibility that the poor dialogue is an attempt to make this more appealing to foreign markets who can paste their own nonsensical interpretation of the story over the uninspiring images. If this didn't sound bad enough they repeat themselves over and over and over and over too. I swear we saw the same flashback happen about three times. If you actually go see this then pay attention to Tom Cruises lines. All he says for the entire movie is ""Huh? Wha? Who? Where? Wha? Which? Huh? Buh? Wha? Who?"" His character Nick Morton (a lame gag if you dissect it) comes across as a senior citizen suffering from Alzheimer's. Or maybe Cruise had no idea what movie he was in and was genuinely uttering these words of confusion.Second - the cinematography. Oh my good heavens...it's appalling. The darkness has been turned up in post-production (no one here had the ability to actually create an atmosphere in-camera) to the point where you have little orientation most of the time. Couple this with very bad editing and you'll struggle to find a sense of place or geography in most locations. There is a scene in a...thing, I'm not sure what it is, where Ahmanet is sucking the souls (or whatever) out of a couple of British bobbies. I have no idea where they were supposed to be. Was it a sewer, a pit, a dry dock, a graveyard, a river bank? No clue. I had absolutely no idea what I was looking at.The clunky, cumbersome, clichéd components that are crudely clumped together to create this crapola are the most basic, childish fantasy tropes you can imagine. This is the kind of trash that barely passed for stories in 80s kid's cartoons. Universal are actually passing this off as a tentpole summer movie in 2017? They expect this to be acceptable for the start of an on-going franchise? It took SIX writers to come up with this?If you are a fan of the Brendan Fraser series, worry not. It seems that Universal are not erasing those movies and are keeping it in continuity with this one since it features the book of Amun-Ra. However, its presence will just remind you that you could be watching a better movie.Despite my complaints (and many others I won't torture you with) I didn't hate this movie. It could have been scary and exciting if a better director and better writer were pulling the strings. This should have been low-key, it should have attempted some kind of modesty instead of arrogantly declaring itself the start off a new franchise as it seems more like the 2003 bomb The League of Extraordinary Gentleman than it does its own self-contained movie.A complete misfire and I can't recommend it at all.

She selects a soldier (Tom Cruise) to become her master's vessel. However, a clandestine monster-hunting society headed by Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe) has other plans for the princess and her god of destruction.The latest reboot of the desert monarch that serves as the cornerstone for Universal's shared Dark Universe, this muddled revival of the 1932 monster flirts with a few interesting ideas but ultimately unravels under the weight of its own exposition, franchise staging and bad CGI.Incidentally, being possessed by a god means you can never call into work sick ever.

48,ironhorse_iv,That's a wrap! This movie probably killed Dark Universe before it really started. The Mummy reboot just wasn't any good.,6,17 June 2017,"This spectacular action-adventure inspired by the classic horror film from 1932 of the same name lacks focus and fails to blend its horror heritage with blockbuster action. While, I wouldn't call, 1999's version of 'the Mummy', a masterpiece. At least, that remake, knew, what it was going for, and how best to fit the story with its direction. After all, the cheesy 1930s's pulp magazine 'Indiana Jones' treasure hunting adventure style does suite the story about an undead Egyptian priest, causing havoc with archaeologists that dare to interrupted, his slumber, best, even if highly clichés. In 2017 reboot, its direction is all over the place. One minute, is a modern day funny/buddy adventure trip with actors, Tom Cruise & Jake Johnson playing modern day, soldier-of-fortune as Nick Morton & Chris Vail, then the next minute, the film turn into a pitch black Gothic horror movie with the mummy turning everybody into zombies, and if you past that, it becomes a futuristic 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' style comic book superhero film. Don't get me wrong, I like, how the movie tries new ideas, like having the majority of events take place, outside of Egypt and giving us, a variety of different undead zombies. However, the mish-mash of wildly vary tones and plot strands is way too jarring for me. One big example is the introduction of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats led by Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe). Not only does it strays too far from the classic Egyptian source material. It also insulting to anybody that read, 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' by author Robert Louis Stevenson, because how many artistic liberties, the film made with the character. Honestly, the movie would had made more sense, if it was Abraham Van Helsing. At least, that character, indeed hunted creatures similar to the undead mummy. In the end, it doesn't make any sense, why Dr. Jekyll is hunting monsters, when he 'technically', is one, unless he looking for a cure for his madness, which the film never established. Another problem with the film is how much, it borrows from other, yet better horror films like 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London'. Already, it's pretty jolting to have Nick sees the disturbing apparitions of his deceased friend informing him that he is curse. However, it never really established, why, his deceased friend is helping him, seeing how Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) has control of Vail, the whole time. Also, if Ahmanet curse the two men; why didn't she curse, Dr. Jennifer Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), as well, seeing how she's the one, that help led Vail & Morton, to unbury the princess from the mercury in the first place. Also, it never establish, who and when, she can possessed people, turn into ghost or turn into mindless zombies. It makes sense for the main leads to be curse, seeing how they unleashed her, but some random technician, later on the film. Why didn't she choose him to be, Set's body. It never established, that Set, needed to be, in Nick's body in the first place, when in truth, the god of violence can be transfer into any corporeal form, even a female host. I guess, Ahmanet just had a thing for Nick's well-toned body, even if she always trying to damage him. Added to the head scratching, without spoiling it, the ending of the film was such a cop out. A really bad, Deus ex machina that makes the whole conflict, pretty pointless, seeing how Morton had that power, the whole time. None of it makes any sense. Also, the obvious pressure to lay the foundations of a wider universe has an immediate impact on this movie as well, with cliffhanging style ending. The film feels the need to shoehorned plot points, setting up, future films, than telling a good stand-alone film. Another problem with this movie besides the incoherent narrative, is the way, it repetitive dump exposition of the same information, through flashbacks & hallucinations, without giving anything new to follow. It's so bad, it might as well, be written in hieroglyphics. I got so tired of seeing the same scenes of Ahmanet's backstory, being retold by another character, that I walk out to the lobby to get more soda to drink; which I rarely do, just to not hear it again. It's that tedious. Despite that, the mummy herself wasn't that bad. I found Boutella's performance, very creepy. She was a formidable villain. As for Cruise, he was alright in the role. It just that, his character was so classic adventurous that it was derivative and out of place in the modern settling. It barely seem like a real character. Plus, Cruise's getting old for these young roles. It's getting more jarring as the years go on with the May/December relationships with female co-stars. As for the rest of the supporting cast, I have to say, they were nearly forgettable, even with Crowe with his awful CGI full make-up, with Wallis being the worst. She can't act, scare. Yet, there were some moments to enjoy. The action scenes were alright even if we seen it, before in other adventure films. The humor, laughable. The scary moments, frightening & visuals, watchable, even the local cinematography was crap. Overall: 'The Mummy' isn't completely rotten. Although, the Universal's first installment of revival of long-running Universal Monsters film series didn't do well with audience and critics, domestically; international, the horror film stands as the biggest global debut of Tom Cruise's career to date. So, there was some appeal. For me, it was tolerable at best. So it doesn't deserve to be buried. It just needed to be said, that it could had been a little bit better. Mad hope, the other movies in the Dark Universe, outshine this black hole of a film in the future years. Not the best way to restart your reboot horror franchise, Universal. Get better at it! Don't need another 2014's 'Dracula Untold'.",The Mummy
49,The-Sarkologist,Goes Nowhere,4,12 June 2017,"A part of me was a little surprised to discover that another mummy film was to hit the screens so soon after Brendan Fraser's exploration into the realms of the Egyptian undead. However, I probably shouldn't be, namely because firstly we are dealing with one of those popular creatures that seems to come back to the screens time and time again, and also I'm probably at that stage in life when pretty much everything seemed to have happened yesterday, so since it is like 18 years since Bredan Fraser took on the undead pharaoh, I guess bringing the concept back, and having Tom Cruise play the title role (and honestly, he doesn't seemed to have aged one bit since Top Gun, but then again he probably really is The Vampire Lestat).Well, this iteration of the mummy is a lot darker than the previous ones, which was more of an adventure movie than anything else. Okay, the Brendan Fraser ones did have the mummy being this really nasty undead creature that seemed to be impossible to beat, but then again Brendan Fraser seems to have that feel about him that makes his films much more softer and light hearted, and the fact that they brought him back for a sequel suggests that this worked reasonably well. However, eighteen years later and all of a sudden the mummy returns, however as a Facebook friend mentioned, it is good to see that we now have a woman playing the role of the mummy.Anyway, as with most movies involving mummys, it begins with an Egyptian monarch who sells her soul to Set, so they decided to grab her and bury her thousands of miles away. Well, thousands of years later we have a couple of grave robbers – not, not archaeologists, grave robbers – disappearing from their regiment in Iraq to try and find some loot to smuggle back home and sell on the black market. Well, the loot they uncover happens to be the mummy. Anyway, they take her back to England, she gets loose and starts rampaging everywhere, Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde make an appearance, Tom Cruise comes out on top and the movie ends. Yeah, that is basically how you can put it down as such.Well, in the end I'm going to have to admit that there wasn't all that much that really stood out about this film. In fact it turned out that it wasn't all that great. It was entertaining, sure, but beyond that it simply seemed to be a rehash of an old story, and one that seemed to only exist to give Tom Cruise something to do. What is interesting is that the concept of the mummy wandering around covered in bandages doesn't seem to be a thing, or much of a thing, anymore. Rather, what we seem to have now is an ancient Egyptian, usually a monarch, subject to a curse, that has been brought back and runs havoc around the world. I guess the days of the bandaged creature with its arms raise up in front of it are long gone.",The Mummy

It also has great special effects. 5.8 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie that 5.8 is underrating it. I give it 10 out of 10. This is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. This is one of the scarier movies I have seen. See this movie it is one of the best horror movies ever. This a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movies ever. Tom Cruise is a great actor. This is scarier then A Nightmare on elm street. And that is not easy to do. Sofia Boutella is a great actress.

52,Reno-Rangan,The first in the Universal studio's 'Dark Universe'!,6,4 November 2017,"If you see the history, the reboots usually fails. It has to be at least half a century old to reboot like 'King Kong'. So the technology advantage would play a major role. It was less than the 20 years, the last 'The Mummy' film had released and pretty impressed everybody with modern visual effects. Even today's young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television. Comparing this to that, there's nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D. In my opinion, they should have waited another decade.It was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film. I mean the character designs. Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession. Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand. The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England, but the plane crash down. Since then, an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men. Fighting against it, followed by how the story ends comes in the later parts.When I first heard about the reboot, I said oh no! Hearing about Tom Cruise's involvement, it became double no! Actually, he was good in the film, but the film was unnecessary at this generation. Even though it did good at the box office, it was considered a decent run. But the studio has a bigger plan, that you would know if you watch the film, that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long. If needed, it would add more in the latter. I feel that's a bad idea right now. Watching it one time is not bad, but no special at all.5.5/10",The Mummy

Bad storyline; bad pacing; bad acting (Tom Cruise in particular); mediocre effects; just bad on every level! It's just not credible at all. The film plays like a spoof - only it's not funny. What did they spend the big budget on? Tom Cruise's salary...? 'The Mummy' with Brendan Fraser was by no means a masterpiece, but it was indeed far more superior to the Tom Cruise version. Who was Russel Crowe's character actually? What was his real purpose? He is not very well explored at all. The Jenny character is just downright silly and so non-funny that it won't even be suitable for slapstick comedy.Next!",The Mummy
54,tomgillespie2002,"A show-all, CGI-laden mess",3,22 August 2017,"Alex Kurtzman's The Mummy marks the arrival of Universal's 'Dark Universe', the studio's attempt at re-branding its flagpole monsters from the archives as a kind of flawed superhero team who will no doubt be brought together to face off a big bad sometime in the future. With a plan to introduce the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and The Phantom of the Opera, The Mummy seems an odd choice to start, given the recent not-so-well received trilogy starring Brendan Fraser that kicked off as recently as 1999. It's a humongous task, but one need only look at the success of Marvel to learn that billions of dollars can be raked in if enough care is taken when building the expansive world from the ground up, teasing the characters and events to come while telling a satisfying self- contained story at the same time.But one can also looks at DC's venture into universe-building to see how it can fall flat on its face, although it now thankfully seems back on track after the success of Wonder Woman. The Mummy makes the grave mistake of laying all of its card on the table, trying to be everything from a horror to an old-school adventure to a Tom Cruise blockbuster, while never convincing as any. Tying this new world of gods and monsters together is Russell Crowe's Dr. Jekyll, the Nick Fury who will eventually unite the team under a secret society called Prodigium, the Dark Universe's version of S.H.I.E.L.D. Shortly after he introduced, he fails to get to his drugs on time and turns into Mr. Hyde, a type of evil Ray Winstone only with super strength, in a scene that verges on the downright embarrassing. Is it not enough to simply mention the name and let the audience generate their own excitement? No, as The Mummy aims to be nothing more than a show-all, CGI-reliant Michael Bay movie that throws so much s**t at the screen that it becomes impossible to care about anything you're seeing.Tom Cruise plays Nick Morton, an unconvincing cheeky-chappy antique hunter-cum-thief who also works for the U.S. Army in some capacity. He's in Iraq with his assistant Chris (comic relief Jake Johnson), and it isn't long before the town around them is torn apart in a hail of bullets. In a stroke of luck, they uncover a massive Egyptian tomb for Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). Nick just wants the loot, but as eye-candy archaeologist and exposition-machine Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) informs us, the discovery is big news. Nick's impatience gets the better of him and he accidentally releases the tomb in a splash of mercury and CGI spiders. It's love at first sight for Ahmanet, who takes an instant liking to Nick's botoxed face and wants him as a vessel for the return of Egyptian God Set. And so begins her vague plan to destroy London with an army of CGI monstrosities and fart clouds, as she sets out to recover a ruby found in a recent excavation.The Mummy is made all the more frustrating by offering tiny glimpses of the film it should have been. A stand-out plane crash set-piece and an impressive performance from Boutella (who was a badass in Kingsman: The Secret Service and stole the show in Stat Trek Beyond) hint at an exciting and modern adventure-horror movie, but the script by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman seems more concerned with pandering to a mainstream crowd and bending the story to the strengths of its lead actor, despite this being one of his worst performances. It switches between horror, comedy and action, often within the same scene, cramming in baffling exposition and universe-building on top. 1999's The Mummy had many of the same problems, but the first film at least had a goofy charm. What this means for the franchise going forward is anyone's guess, although things to seem to be moving forward despite this film's critical and commercial failures. But will anyone seriously want to see a stand alone film about this interpretation of Dr. Jekyll?",The Mummy
55,cruise01,Its a summer blockbuster film that entertains with action and opening up this dark world universe. But it ends too soon when it reaches the climax.,8,9 June 2017,"The Mummy is a blockbuster adventure and the start in Universals film series known as the Dark Universe. May not be a great movie. It does its best in entertaining with some exciting action sequences, some decent visual effects, and Tom Cruise taking the lead in this adventure story of Gods and Monsters universe. In all comparison, this film does take itself way to seriously which does make you miss the humor and fun that Brendan Fraser had in his first two Mummy movies until the third one was a complete waste of time. But seriously, the action and the humor of the first two movies is what made it work. The plot follows a treasure hunting soldier Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and his buddy Chris (Jake Johnson) being caught in the middle of a battle in Iraq. Only to discover a hidden buried tomb underneath a small village. Brings the attention of the military and archaeologist Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) who wants to bring the tomb back to London to study it. Only to unravel the tomb of princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) who was mummified after she murdered her father and his new newborn for being the next in the heir. She awakens to release evil in the world and wants to resurrect a god of death. What I liked about The Mummy is the film was very fast paced. Clocking in around an hour and forty mins. There was plenty of action and lots of seeing Tom Cruise running on screen again. It never slows down until the mid second act of meeting Henry (Russell Crowe) and his organization that has a hidden agenda of hunting monsters. Which does make the direction of the movie feel a little weird since this is a Mummy movie and it is opening up a world of other existent monsters. Like the role that Russell Crowe is playing which is a good choice. Yes, the direction may be rushing of showing us this universe and may be at times incoherent. It is an adventure movie but tries to be scary when it is not. Also, has that American Werewolf in Paris feel when Nick is talking to a ghostly figure of a character that is guiding him the direction he needs to go. If you could put aside with all this set up for this universe and enjoy it for what it is trying to do. Tom Cruise is an awesome actor. I love most of his movies. I am curious to see the direction his character has for this universe. Sofia Boutella is amazing. After seeing her in Kingsman and Star Trek. She portrays a good villain. Annabelle Wallis was decent as the archaeologist. Russell Crowe plays an interesting character. That I am excited to see more. The action sequences like the plane crashing and seeing Tom and Annabelle in a zero g stunt. It was thrilling and exciting. Plus seeing these characters fight against the undead that Ahmanet keeps rising after she sucks the life out of these people is also exciting. Then, some more running in London as Ahmanet is chasing them with her sandstorm destroying the city. The one thing I did not like with The Mummy is the first two acts did well building up the suspense and cramming up a lot with this universe. The action in the climax was pretty short. Action in movies is suppose to get more exciting as it reaches the climax. When it came to Nick fighting with Ahmanet, it was short and ended to quickly. The climax was not as exciting like the first two acts. Felt like the director Alex Kurtzman wanted to end the movie a little too soon. Overall, The Mummy is a good blockbuster film, it may take itself too seriously leaving out the humor that the original trilogy had. Tom Cruise may seem out of place as the cocky character. The film has plenty of action and fast paced. May not be a smart move in making it a fast paced if they are trying to build this Dark Universe. Its worth checking out if you are looking for escapism this summer and need to see a blockbuster movie.",The Mummy
56,eddie_baggins,One of Tom Cruise's worst films,2,11 September 2017,"As a potential franchise and extended universe starter, The Mummy is about as bad as it gets.As a film judged in its own rights, The Mummy is sadly equally as dire.I still remember viewing the Brendan Fraser starring Mummy's during my childhood and while those films are the very definition of popcorn entertainment, they had a certain charm and energy about them this Alex Kurtzman's Tom Cruise starring flop has so little of.Kurtzman's film is so devoid of any form of spark or enthusiasm, that the whole thing should've been wrapped up in cloth and bound and thrown into a very deep tomb for the world never to see but for some reason this non-event was billed as one of the year's biggest blockbuster events.Reception and box office receipts attest to the fact that that was not to be the case and it's not hard to see why audiences failed to warm to this below-average experience despite the presence of its normally bankable leading man.One of the main problems with Kurtzman's film, of which there are many of, is the fact that if you've seen any of the Mummy's over their cinematic history you've seen this iteration done before and while the filmmakers try to hide their generic plot line with the addition of Russell Crowe's Dr. Jekyll or an abundance of action sequences (of which only a plane crash stands up as being exciting or inventive), it doesn't help save the films inability to make us warm to it or make us care in the slightest about what's happening.Lumbered with a dull and tiresome role as the films central figure Nick Morton, Cruise seems to have come to terms with himself to the fact he signed the wrong contract and delivers one of his most charmless performances as the supposedly roguish Morton It's not likely you'll ever hear anyone admit to this but so bad is Cruise's role and so tired his delivery, that you'll be wishing for the good old days of Fraser's antics and surrounded by an uninterested looking cast that includes Jake Johnson, Annabelle Wallis and Sofia Boutella as the films terrible big bad Princess Ahmanet, Cruise and the whole acting ensemble bring nothing to The Mummy's table and fail to save a film that's drowning in a sea of uninspired ideas and executions.Final Say – Almost everyone has called The Mummy out as being not only one of the year's worst films but a potential killer to Universal's Dark Universe series and even with an open mindset and a will to be entertained, The Mummy fails at almost everything it does, which includes killing Tom Cruise's usual power to elevate films his a part of.1 zombie friend out of 5",The Mummy
57,leonblackwood,Could have been so much better!,4,2 January 2018,"Review:
After hearing about the Dark Universe, I was really looking forward to this movie but it just turned out to be a typical Tom Cruise movie, with Cruise being the hero. The beginning reminded me of the old school Indianna movies but not in the same class, and when the Witch gets involved it switches to a mysterious, dark movie, which wasn't that well done. Cruise plays Nick Morton, who seeks for ancient treasures so he sell them for a high price on the black market. After stealing a map from an archaeologist, Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), Nick and his close friend, Sgt. Vail (Jake Johnson) come across a mysterious tomb which is deep beneath the desert. Now that Jenny has caught up with Nick and his sidekick, they decide to ship the tomb back to there homeland, so they can investigate. On there journey, the ancient princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who was buried alive due to her evil behaviour, comes alive and seeks vengeance as her destiny was unjustly taken from her. As Nick brought her back from the dead, she picks him as her new love but he refuses to cross over to the dark side. There are many other elements to the plot but I decided to keep it simple. Some of the action scenes wasn't too bad but it's hard to see the attention to detail, because it's all shot in the dark. The director tried to add some wit to the project, especially the beginning but it didn't seem to work with the tension that was present on screen. On the plus side, the cinematography was on point and some of the stunts from Cruise were pretty impressive. I was hoping for more from the first movie in this franchise, if they do decide to go on with the Dark Universe and I think they need to rethink the director, who really could have done much more with this all time classic. Disappointing!Round-Up: 
This movie was directed by Alex Kurtzman, 44, who also brought you People Like Us starring Chris Pine and Michelle Pfeiffer. As this was his second project, he wouldn't have been my first choice to bring this all time classic to the big screen, and judging by the result, the audience agree. The storyline really wasn't on point and Alex didn't push Cruise to the limit. After seeing Tropic Thunder many times, I'm surprised that Cruise hasn't gone in another direction with his acting, to prove that he can cover every element. He seems to be stuck in a rut at the moment, and all of his movies just seem the same. Don't get me wrong, he is good at what he does, and he really does love a challenge when it comes to action but enough is enough. Although this movie made a decent profit, the studios have questioned the future of the Dark Universe, due to the poor reception of this film. I just hope that they go back to the drawing board with the whole franchise because it hasn't had a good start.Budget: $125million

61,paul-allaer,Movie fails on many levels,4,11 June 2017,"As ""The Mummy"" (2017 release; 107 min.) opens, we are in ""England, 1127"", where a crusader is buried. We then shift to ""England, Present Day"", where a large crusade burial chamber is discovered while constructing a new subway link. Then we flash back to ancient Egypt and the story of Princess Ahmanet. AFter that we shift to ""Iraq, Present Day"", as we get to know Nick and Chris, who are keen on finding artifacts for resale on the black market, and in a parallel path we are also introduced to Jenny, a British archaeologist. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest firm from producer-director Alex Kurtzman, best known for having (co-)written a number of big budget action movies (including The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Star Trek Into Darkness, etc.). Here Kurtzman reboots the Mummy franchise, with Tom Cruise as the front person. Cruise is omni-present in the movie, and in virtually every frame. I went to see this based on the tantalizing trailer which made it look like an incredible action movie with over the top stunts. And indeed there are a few of those scenes (best one is of course the airplane stunt, featured prominently in the trailer, which comes about 20 min. into the movie. Alas, after that, it's mostly CGI that dominates the film. No to mention the plot, which is as paper-thin as it is nonsensical. The supporting cast includes a small role for Russel Crowe as...yes, Jekyll/Hyde, I'm not kidding! ""The past cannot remain buried forever"", warns Jekyll early on. British actress Annabelle Wallis, who was in another big budget movie earlier this year (""King Arthur""), plays Cruise's female sidekick Jenny. I went to see this with my 30 yr. old son, and he was equally disappointed with the movie. ""I'm not sure what exactly the problem was, but it simply didn't jell"", was his comment to me as we were leaving the theater.""The Mummy"" opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but just okay for being on opening weekend. If you like big budget action/adventure movies that are heavy on CGI, you may like this, or not. I love most of what Tom Cruise does (already looking forward to his next one ""American Made"", whose trailer played before ""The Mummy""), but I felt let down, to be honest, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this.

62,subxerogravity,"So-So Blockbuster for Tom Cruise, and the lackluster start to the Dark Universe.",6,13 June 2017,"I love the Dark Universe logo though, and It was cool seeing elements within the Mummy that showed us what the Dark universe was going to be like and the connections between them.I guess this is something that all blockbusters might need to do now in order to get into the billions. They all needed to be a part of a big connection. The big diff with the dark universe is that it's not based on a comic book, it's based on universal monsters, which was a film franchise from the Golden age of Cinema that was revamped at one point by Hammer films who redid all those classics and now they are about to go through a superhero movie influenced reboot.This movie concentrates on the Universal Monster the Mummy, somewhat of a remake of the trilogy that started in 1999. Tom Cruise, who I would have not expected to do yet another franchise (A sign of a falling star?) stars as a tomb raider (Not the noble Laura Croft kind) whose greed caused him to become the attraction of a 5,000-year-old queen of Egypt who needs him to be the host of The god of death in order to fulfill their pack.It was kind of cool if not all that creative how they were able to write in the Iraq conflict with the film stating that the mummy was bury away from Egypt as a means to erase her evil from the history books.Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise in the movie: a charming persona whose good at running and likes to take his shirt off, it's getting repetitive that he does all three in each movie lately, but I must admit, I'm impress with what I see, after all we all hope we look as good as Cruise when we are his age. I'm guessing Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher are not enough to keep the last of the movie stars on top of his game, and considering he was once up for the role that's making Robert Downey Jr. someone to care about, I'm sure he would like to get into something like that, but honestly from what I saw he should have picked something else.The more interesting character to look at is Russell Crowe who plays what I can only believe to be the Nick Fury in this new Dark universe, but he is no Nick Fury. Does not really give the presence of cool and importance that Sam L. Jackson brought to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I don't want to forget the Mummy herself. Out of the four movies the original mummy is still the best but this Queen of Egypt is OK. I feel she's more misused. It's like the movie is called the Mummy, but It feels like she was maybe third on the list of importance behind Tom Cruise and the Dark Universe overall.It's a fun action packed adventure don't get me wrong. It has the kinetic energy that Tom Cruise is known for in his features and I loved the dark elements of classic horror that the mummy was doing, but it's missing the cherry on top that would make this a summer hit.Maybe the other movies in the Dark universe will be better?http://cinemagardens.com",The Mummy

This is a reboot of the Mummy series-they even have a female mummy for the first time-that is not connected to the previous ones, but there are several Easter eggs scattered throughout this film-The Book of the Dead from the 1999 Mummy is seen, as well as a skull with fangs and an amphibian arm. Tom and Jake play a couple of special-ops soldiers that moonlight as treasure hunters. Annabelle is an archaeologist along for the ride that is looking for something more specific. They find Sofia, buried in a sarcophagus, which of course, is soon set loose. Sofia wants a magical sacred dagger to bring an evil god to life, in Tom's body. Russell plays Annabelle's boss, who runs a special team of monster hunters-and wait until you find out his character's name.

But it's definitely not as bad as I was told it was. Tom Cruise never ages, maybe he should've played the mummy. But casting a woman in the role of the mummy was clever. There are nods to the 1999 mummy series all through, but you can't turn your head otherwise you'll miss them. Keep your eyes peeled during the scene in Dr. Jekyll's library. This movie had a lot of surprises in it and then I realized they were making a ""monster universe"" with this- that's an idea that universal should maintain, they should definitely make more of these. And despite the bad rating, it definitely made its money back and then some.",The Mummy
72,alindsay-al,An average remake that is a disappointing start for the dark universe,5,10 June 2017,"With universal trying to launch there dark cinematic universe they have decided to reboot the mummy and I thought this film was very forgettable but not terrible. The premise of this film sees a group of people come across a tomb of a mummy who is hell bent on achieving her destiny. Tom cruise plays the lead in this film and he is really good in this film, he oozes charisma in the role and I also found his character pretty funny and that is die to his talent as an actor. He does his best with what he is given and I found him the best character in this film. Russell crowe is in the film and he did a good job, his role is very interesting to watch and I like how he may be involved with different properties in this universe. Sofia boutella plays the mummy in this film and I thought she was great in this film, she totally sells her role perfectly and I thought she actually added quite a bit of depth to her character. Annabelle Wallis plays the love interest in this film and I call her that because her character was completely useless in this film, she was incredibly bland and I found her character boring especially when you are watching cruise. I also thought Jake Johnson was over the top in this film and actually quite irritating to watch. The story is weak, for a film called the mummy this film hardly focuses on the mummy and spends a lot of time trying to world build and it doesn't focus enough on its main plot to really make you care at all. The script as mentioned before has a lot of humour to it and I was pleasantly surprised to laugh as much as I did during this film. However, I do feel it affected the drama in this film and I didn't feel like it hit like it would have liked to. The style of the film works when it really does spectacle and I found some of the action scenes good to watch. But this film does use horror clichés and I found them quite irritating and I didn't feel like the stakes felt high enough in the final act. Overall this is a OK film but I don't have any motivation to ever see it again and I don't think it is really worth a watch.",The Mummy
73,CubsandCulture,Why? Just Why? Tell a story before building a universe.,3,10 June 2019,"The Dark Universe was utterly scuttled by this dreadful film. (Through given that the film turned a small profit maybe universal is going to try again) It is humorless (abet it tries really hard to have comic relief moments) , witless film that captures neither the action adventure fun of the 90's remake or the creepy horror of the 32' original. The main issue is the film is not telling a single story but trying to set-up an entire franchise. The studio really put the cart before the horse here with this whole idea. There was no solid ground to anchor this concept.Also this is minor but my God Crowe looks fat in this film.",The Mummy
74,Fluke_Skywalker,Should've stayed buried,5,17 October 2017,"Plot; An Army Sgt. and an archaeologist team up to save the world from an ancient Egyptian Mummy.Meant to kick off Universal's Dark Universe (their equivalent to Marvel's MCU), the Tom Cruise lead The Mummy was harshly derided by critics and all but ignored domestically (it fared better abroad). Reports have since circulated that Cruise more or less took over the production of the film, gearing it to focus on his character at the expense of the titular mummy and using director Alex Kurtzman like a puppet. Whether or not any of this is true I don't know, and frankly I don't care. All I want from a vehicle like this is a good time, or at least a 2 hour distraction, Cruise's baggage and Xenu be damned.Like Marvel's first two Iron Man films, The Mummy has a lot of heavy lifting to do. It has to tell its own story while also pulling back the curtain to reveal that there's a larger, stranger world beyond it. In the end it manages these two things, but in a somewhat ham-fisted way. The clumsy storytelling serves to undermine the film's action, which is loud and constant, but without stakes or dramatic consequence that really matter.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise. He can do more when it's pulled out of him, but here he's content to just be himself. The script seems to want his character to be a selfish anti-hero, but Cruise never fully commits to it. I think the movie would've been a bit more fun if he had. Russell Crowe--sort of the Dark Universe's Nick Fury--does yeoman's work, but you can't make a filet mignon out of Spam. Sofia Boutella might've been a very effective villainess had the film not treated her like an afterthought. FYI to Universal. It's called The Mummy, not The Nick Morton.Whatever its many dramatic shortcomings, the biggest sin committed by The Mummy is that it just isn't any fun.",The Mummy

76,jimbo-53-186511,A darker Mummy film that doesn't really work,4,31 March 2018,"US Soldier Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) inadvertently awakens an Egyptian princess from her crypt after she has been buried there for over 3000 years. Once she has been awakened Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Bouella) sets her sights on fulfilling her destiny which she was unable to achieve all those years ago. Nick starts to fear for his life when he starts to learn that he is part of her big plan...I was a bit apprehensive about this latest Mummy film being given a darker treatment - after all part of the reason that the Brendan Fraser film worked was because it was fun and charming. Like the recent Fantastic Four reboot this latest offering of The Mummy just goes to show that darker isn't always better...For a start the storytelling is rushed and rather muddled and at times I struggled to get to grips with what was going on half of the time - various characters seemed to get cursed, but for different reasons. Sgt Vail (Jake Johnson) as far as I can recall got cursed from being bit - erm I thought this was The Mummy not The Walking Dead and I wasn't entirely sure why Tom Cruise's character got cursed - was it because he cut the rope and was thereby the chosen one? Who knows because very little was explained here. The lack of explanation can be further extended to Russell Crowe's character; a doctor who seems to be cursed (or so I assume as there was no explanation or backstory for his character) but seems to have some kind of antidote that suppresses the curse. Tom Cruise has to be careful though because if Crowe doesn't have his antidote/serum or whatever it is then he gets all angry, goes into attack mode and starts talking like Ray Winstone - this was actually funny, but for all the wrong reasons. To give Russell Crowe such a worthless role is a waste of his talents. The same thing can be said for Sgt Vail (Jake Johnson) a man who gets killed early on and keeps popping up at random intervals adding nothing to the film.Aside from being fun and charming, one of the other strengths of the Brendan Fraser film lay with the chemistry between the actors; Fraser and Weisz were great in that film and were fun to watch. In this version of The Mummy Cruise and Wallis are unable to get anywhere near to Weisz and Fraser - although they are perhaps held back by the stiff and rather more serious storytelling in this version. The film doesn't even shine in the SFX department and doesn't really improve all that much on those that we saw in the 99 film.Like The Fantastic Four reboot The Mummy is another dark interpretation which fails to improve on the original. The acting isn't great, the storytelling is messy, the characters in the film are either pointless or due to weak development are difficult to give a damn about. You're better off sticking with the Brendan Fraser version because despite some of its faults it was at least a fun old fashioned adventure film with a likeable cast. The only minor positives about this film is that it was fun and quite enjoyable at the start with Cruise and Johnson starting to form a potentially interesting double act (perhaps the writer's shouldn't have killed Johnson's character off as him and Cruise may have been able to conjure up some workable chemistry). There were also odd moments dotted throughout the film which were enjoyable too. It's interesting that the producers employed 6 different screenwriters - 6 REALLY??? (a couple of whom have written screenplays to films that I have enjoyed), but perhaps in the case of The Mummy it's possibly a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth...",The Mummy

Cinematography of the movie also could've been made better.Acting is decent and Tom Cruise was as usual perfect but Sofia Boutella was surprisingly superb and in my opinion in few scenes she had outshone Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis was a disappointment and Russell Crowe was underused and considering his talent he could've been utilized much better.Climax and the end of the movie also doesn't excites much, for me an average movie which could've been with better with some good writing and crisp screenplay but can be watched once.",The Mummy
78,r96sk,"Nothing diabolical, but a fair distance from good too",6,22 November 2020,"A disappointment.'The Mummy' begins with promise. I initially enjoyed the duo of Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson, the plot set-up and the location choice of London. Russell Crowe is a standout name too. However, sadly, the film gets progressively worse throughout the 110 minutes.The premise kinda just falls into itself, with any interest disappearing pretty quickly. The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome, as does all the comedy in the film in truth - there's a few chuckles, but nothing laugh worthy. The zombie vibe doesn't fit, either.What also doesn't help is the fact they're blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort, which they put too much focus on. I found the effects hit-and-miss, I feel like they could've used more practical stuff rather than relying so much on CGI - for the make-up et al. at least.Cruise leads ably and does a decent enough job - he has done far greater of course. Crowe never really gets going in my opinion, though does have a couple of cool to look at scenes late on. Sofia Boutella is alright, as is Annabelle Wallis.

Tom waking up naked in the morgue - wow his body looks incredible. On the flip side Russell Crowe as mad scientist Henry Jekyll refers to Tom as a young man.

One sinister guy is in charge looking for something specific. Earlier we saw some some crusaders bury some stone way back when.Then we're in Egypt were princess Ahmanet is about the obtain all power for herself, except that somehow now there's a newborn brother of hers that she has to eliminate. So she makes a deal with the god of the dead, Set. During some ceremony to summon him she's captured, mummified and transported far away to ensure her evil will never resurface.Well, in the present in Iraq two goofs are running around looking for valuable relics when they're chased by terrorists. They order an airstrike and are rescues. Turns out they are actually military. Then some annoying English chick shows up and she can somehow boss the US military around. Turns out the missile strike revealed some archaeological site, namely, Ahmanet burial-site/prison. They drag out the sarcophagus and on their way somewhere, one of the goofs who was bitten by a crab turns into a zombie. Anyway, the plane crashes in London.The other goof, named Nick, wakes up in the morgue somehow unharmed. He starts having visions of Egypt and Ahmanet and keeps seeing his zombie friend who informs him that he's Ahmanet chosen one. But of course at the crash site the mummy has awoken and is feeding on the living to gain strength. Nick and the English chick make it to church were the mummy is. Both the mummy and the chick are looking for a dagger, namely the dagger that Ahmanet was going to use for her evil ceremony. And she actually finds but it's missing a stone and now plenty of zombies are after the pair who escape thanks to a bunch of paramilitary who show up out of nowhere.In charge of them is the sinister guy from the subway intro. He's Jekyll and Hyde apparently and explains everything to Nick. His group wants to use him to allow Ahmanet to finish her ceremony and then once and for all kill Set. By then though our mummy captured by Jekyll manages to escape, and retrieve the dagger just as workers find the stone in the Crusader tomb.Ahmanet now causes havoc around London after having raised an army of dead crusaders, tries to complete the dagger and summon Set. Nick of course will have to confront her one and his curse.Most reviews here focus on corporate strategy or movie history instead on the actual movie. The Mummy is a decent action adventure flick that, to me at least, was better than expected. As long as you don't expect a classic or some such thing. This is your typical efficient, CGI-intensive summer movie. And it's not the case that it lacks story. On the contrary perhaps they could have tightened and shortened things a bit. Of course the director could have done a better job of focusing on the story. The main problem with this mummy movie is that the mummy isn't much of a character here and does very little. The other problem is the setting in London doesn't work at all for an Egyptian Mummy movie. The action is fairly good, Cruise and the rest of the cast do a good job. The Mummy is entertaining and hardly as bad as most ""reviews"" would lead you to believe.",The Mummy

84,aharmas,A Boring Mess,2,16 June 2017,"Universal released many of the classic monster movies in the 30's and 40's, and they were fun. Yes, we might say they were loaded with superb CGI or fantastic special effects, but they scared the little ones and few adults, and if that didn't happen, we still managed to have 90 minutes of solid entertainment because the people who made them knew how to make that kind of movie, working with a simple but serviceable script. Eventually there were sequels, not as good as the originals, but I don't think I have ever encountered the disappointment which the new incarnation of ""The Mummy"" shows.Just recently, ""X-Men Apocalypse"" had an introduction to explain the ties of Gods and super heroes/mutants in that movie. It felt like a B- movie reminder of how the Mummy movies started. There was a sarcophagus and everything. Yes, the new movie has a sarcophagus, but it's anything but imposing or scary. I found it laughable and a sign that things were not going to improve.It's never clear literally and figuratively who finds these scripts and productions worth filming. The story is confusing and weak, and there is nothing here I could recommend to someone who wants to go for a couple of hours of light escapism. It's not that it's loaded with complex ideas, either. Yes, there's a bit of an interesting proposition by changing the gender of the ""mummy"", but the curse is well cursed from the beginning.Another aspect that is extremely bothersome is that the film makers seem to believe that dark is scary, and yes, that could work if there's something scary to present or threaten the unlucky members of the expedition or audience. Here, it's not light or dark, but a really weird shade of blue that hurts the eyes and can induce a headache quite effectively.It's been fun watching Tom Cruise play someone who is trying to fight back, but maybe it's time for him to find a better script or something more appropriate to a man of his age. Somehow, this factor also weakened the entire premise. The man might no longer be a matinée idol.",The Mummy
85,Enchorde,Too much subplots and too little main plot,5,1 August 2018,"It is probably impossible not to compare this to the most recent Mummy-series launched in 1999. But it isn't really fair. The latter was an actionadventure with a heavy dose of comedy and devil may care-charm. The former and newer, a start to the movie series Dark Universe is shifted to be just that, darker. It is more of an action... something. On imdb it is said to be adventure and my cable said horror. It is a little of both, but not really either. And that is the problem.I like the backstory and Sofia Boutella cast as the Mummy. Her Mummy is powerful and vengeful, but also devious and driven by a desire that gives the character much more depth (I like Ahmanet more than Imhotep). But unfortunately the story is not really exploring Ahmanet, nor really letting here take her place as the main antagonist. It is not her or her powers our heroes flee from or combat.Because, somewehere, to me inexplicably, the movie turns into a zombie-movie. Don't know if it is an attempt to bring originality to the mummy-series. But to copy another horror motif, that people becomes zombies, sorry mummies, if they are bitten by another mummy/zombie is not a succesful way to do it. And then throw in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (whom our hero just must have a fight with), it is no wonder Ahmanet doesn't get any scream time (and too much of it she is just chained up). I get that Crowe's Jekyll probably is set up as some bureau director (like Avengers Nick Fury) that have some part in the Dark Universe to connect the different monstermovies. But if it is a subplot, then he shouldn't take over the part as main antagonist, let it be a peripheral character until his own movie (again, like Nick Fury).With the mixed and underdeveloped plot this becomes mainly an generic action, unfortunately augmented by Cruise. He knows how to do those action roles, but can't carry the tongue in cheek thiefsoldier he is set to play (now it is the movie itself that compares with the earlier Mummy-series). Lastly I liked Wallis, but I am not sure of her role and character. Is she the expert assistant and sidekick to Nick, or is she just an innocent bystander caught up in the events (and love interest) that Nick needs to save? She is both, and she is neither.I really hope the Dark Universe continues. I even would like see more of the Mummy, especially Ahmanet. But there must be stronger plots that doesn't try to do too much.",The Mummy
86,aidanratesmovies,Very Underrated,7,2 April 2021,"Although it certainly has its rockier moments, The Mummy is a solidly entertaining and action packed little creature flick that harnesses some great storytelling elements even if it can't help but be a bit stuffed by the end. I feel this film is criminally underrated, it wasn't anything great, nor was it quite as good as the 90's flick, but it certainly proves to be a worthy adversary and I enjoyed many things about it. The look of the film is fantastic, a haunted gothic daydream that proves to be continually beautiful shot after shot. The GGI can be a bit noticeable at times, but most of the action scene are incredibly well done, and most can be rather intense. None of the actors are great, but they all seem to be having fun with their respective roles. I wish we got to see more of the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, but Cruise does manage to be an entertaining lead as always, and Crowe and Wallis do prove to be fun little side characters. I'm a huge fan of Jake Johnson from New Girl and even from his underrated little comedy Let's Be Cops but he does not fit the vibe of this film, and every time he is on screen, the film shifts its tone to fit him with wonky dialogue that just seems too forced to laugh at. Some of the dialogue in general too can feel a bit forced, mainly towards the beginning, and the pacing a bit slower towards the end. In the end though, I enjoyed The Mummy for what it was, a solid little action flick that creatively reimagines yet another classic story.My Rating: 7.25/10.",The Mummy

Still, I tried to go into it with an open mind and a willingness to...Yeah, this isn't good.This was such an obviously desperate attempt to scramble into the 'Cinematic Universe' venue and it seriously hurts this movie. The ending is absurd, which is a shame because it was nearly something. Characters are forced in, which is a shame because I actually rather liked Crowe and his whole thing here but nothing else really works. Nothing is explained at all, things just happen and no one is really acting it up enough to drag it out of that mire. Cruise is trying something but he's in the wrong movie, thinking he's working on something better when he's not. Boutella is here, doing her thing, and I actually like her in other things but wow does she seem to know how to pick bad movies.It's not all bad, it's just that none of it tracks so there's no real sense of understanding or sympathy for anyone. It's really not as bad as some of the criticism, but this is a mediocre attempt at best. Frasier did it better years ago and now this... I guess if it's streaming somewhere?

After bumping right into you...So it's important to mention that The Tom Cruise MUMMY is, in its core, almost exactly like AN American WEREWOLF IN London, arguably the greatest werewolf picture ever and, directed by John Landis, centers on two doomed vacationing hikers: one gets killed by an initial attack, the other injured: The latter has ominous, foreboding dreams while his not-very-pleasant-looking dead friend appears randomly, offering spooky yet cordial reminders that he, the living, must also die to lift The Curse... After a little while, the same thing occurs concerning two American soldiers in Iraq. Tom Cruise and his reluctant buddy — a whiner so saturated with fevered sarcasm you would think he'd remain the comic relief sidekick (like John Hannah in the 1999 version) against Tom's Indiana Jones-like determination to make digging up artifacts a number one priority... Soldiering be damned...Of course there's a beautiful girl. Actually, two. One is the ingenue and the other, as you probably already know by the promotions, is our title antagonist: an ancient and lustful, tattoo-faced black widow who literally gets inside old Tom's head. He even says at one point: ""She's in my head.""Leading to surreal moments where the director attempts combining a Mind-Trip- Thriller Sub-Genre to the Action-Fantasy Mainline — along with a few violent battle scenes with the frantic pace of THE WALKING DEAD, WORLD WAR Z or any sinewy CGI zombie outing, it's impossible to distinguish who or what should be feared most since they all look alike, and do the same thing: Attack and Attack, and Attack some more. The plot-line, having to do with our flawed hero attempting to reverse this particularly personal Mummy's Curse, is contrived, forced. And then there's Russell Crowe, who narrates the prologue set way, way back during The Crusades, only to return as... get this... a doctor named Henry Jekyll in the present time. Funny thing is, the surrounding characters are actually surprised when it's revealed what he's been... Hyding all along...Crowe's entire role is a banal, superfluous distraction to one of the most unnecessary reboots ever. And it's no surprise that, being a Tom Cruise vehicle, when it comes down to it, everything's about him. Like in the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE — what had been an eclectic ensemble becomes a one man show. It's more like THE DADDY than THE MUMMY. Or perhaps THE DUMMY since he makes all the wrong decisions, and is hardly someone to root for or care about. In fact, along with the pouting love-interest, no one on board has anything to say, or add to the overall mindless void of it all. Somewhere, though, Brendan Frasier is smiling.

(So is its movie audience).SYNOPSIS: The mummy returns and she is one really angry woman.JIM'S REVIEW: Be forewarned: Stay in the safety of your homes, dear moviegoers! The pestilence has arrived. Pandora's Box has been opened and it released The Mummy, a 2017 reboot of of the 1999 reboot of the the old Boris Karloff 1932 original film. Old legends die hard. Yes, there are some new twists in this updated version and lots of CGI to mask its flaws (of which there are many). Unintentionally, this is a horror movie in many ways.￼This time around, Tom Cruise is our swashbuckling hero, Nick Morton. Now Nick is a handsome daredevil type and he stumbles on an ancient tomb and accidentally unearthed the body of Princess Ahmanet, the Pharoah's evil daughter. In this version, this mummy has trans-gendered into a female force to be reckoned with (and I don't know if that is really a step forward in gay terms). Sofia Boutella is that evil force, who somehow has a deep crush, bordering on obsession, on Nick, who has a deep crush on an pretty archaeological assistant, Jenny Halsey, played by Annabelle Wallis, who feels a similar reaction as well. One can't blame either dame as Mr. Cruise still possesses the fit body of a 30 year old, even though he is nearing his mid-50's. Why, any evil-deadly deity or live female could go stark raving mad over him! Can you blame them? But Nick is of stoic stock and resist he will. The entire movie is spent on this ill-matched relationship and the havoc it causes. (Match.com could have easily solved this dilemma.)￼According to this dim-witted plot, she is hellbent in getting Mr. Cruise's character to reciprocate her fatal attraction. Nothing will get in her way...no London landmark...no thousands of tourists...no bad screenplay. Stand back world, she's coming through...nothing can stop her now! And she's bringing zombies too!￼The direction by Alex Kurtzman is barely adequate. The film is stunt laden and energy leaden. There is little suspense or scares, just lots of action that disappoints as it follows its overworked formula and digs itself deeper into a bigger hole of logic as the story goes on. The chase sequences are plentiful and the action is non-stop, from well staged stunt-work and good but unmemorable CGI, the best involving a tense plane crash and the worst (and I mean laughably bad) being an underwater chase with zombie Crusade soldiers that looked like a water ballet in slow motion. The special effects, for the most part, aren't very special.￼Mr. Cruise is in typical action hero mode. Ms. Wallis plays another spunky damsel-in-distress. Only Ms. Boutella makes an impression...but when you are a sexy independent woman with tattooed hieroglyphics decorating your bluish skin, who wouldn't! Also on hand are Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson. Mr. Crowe takes his melodramatic cues well and Mr. Johnson adds the comic relief. ￼But the screenplay-by-committee of six, led by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dylan Kussman is so dumb, It mixes monster themes and genres to create a ""dark universe"", one that is being highly touted by the studios as its next big franchise. This may indeed lead to a Penny Dreadful mix, but this first entry is only dreadful. That this may be first of many is the film's real horror. ￼The movie ends on one of the most ludicrous and unsatisfying endings for any motion picture in recent years. Granted, an action fantasy film deals with the world of the unreal, but it still needs to make sense and follow a logical course as it goes from Point A to Point B. The movie is all over the place.

I've only made one film and it was a little-known drama but trust me, I'm ready to go the fantasy/thriller route.Production head for Perfect World Pictures: That's the spirit Alex. We are with you 100%.Chris Morgan (producer): Wait. I'm not 100% on board with this thing. Those Mummy movies with Brendan Fraser weren't that great to begin with.Kurtzman: True, but I have Mr. Tom Cruise as my lead. He'll guarantee a box office hit. We'll put him through the ringer. He'll get his butt beat to a pulp and then he'll get right back up again. Of course we'll have to add a little bloody makeup to his face. Production head for Perfect World Pictures: Cruise is dope.Morgan: I disagree. He was a box office champ maybe 15 years ago. I mean isn't he a bit long in the tooth? And let's face it, won't he be labeled as miscast here? Cruise has never really done anything like this before. This ain't Top Gun the mummy version people.Kurtzman: He's Cruise and he's still a reliable movie star. As for his appearance, well he doesn't look 54 since he's been dyeing his hair.Production head for Perfect World Pictures: That should help since his female romantic interest is about 20 years younger than he is.Kurtzman: Oh and Tommy boy saw 1932's The Mummy as a kid. He was inspired by it and showed interest in coming on board.Morgan: I don't know guys. This might come back to bite us on the butt.Production head for Perfect World Pictures: Chris, it's all good. We have $125 million in special effects and the PG-13 crowd will have their eyes popping out of their heads. Oh yeah, and we're gonna make sure Cruise is running for his life like usual. Plus, Russell Crowe is on board as an Uber-villain. Alex, make sure we have Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe getting down and dirty in a fight scene.Kurtzman: You know it. I'll also be sure to add an epic, Cruise-like plane crash as well. Cruise is gangster doing his own stunts.Morgan: What about the script? I heard we're using three writers. Isn't that a bad omen in Hollywood?Kurtzman: We'll be fine. Cruise's screen presence is decent even though his acting has been paperweight ever since Magnolia. And wait till you see the CGI we're throwing down. I'm talking camel spiders, rats, and crotchety zombies. A summer 2017 release will certainly help.Production head for Perfect World Pictures: Oh I forgot to tell you guys that Jake Johnson is being added to the cast. He's Cruise's comic foil and sidekick. Jake is excited.Kurtzman: He was funny in Let's Be Cops.Morgan: I think he's a little bland. I saw his Drinking Buddies and that film really stunk up the joint. What if he's labeled as miscast too?Production head for Perfect World Pictures: Chris, you sure are in a negative frame of mind. We're solid bro. Trust me.Morgan: Fine. So what is this new Mummy reboot gonna replicate? Are we going for a tongue-in-cheek Raiders of the Lost Ark?Kurtzman: Exactly.Production head for Perfect World Pictures: Yup.Chris Morgan: Sh*t. Okay, here we go. Let's make a freaking movie.Rating: 2 stars.",The Mummy
92,rannynm,"Adventure, Action, Fantasy and Horror Combined",6,8 June 2017,"The Mummy impressed me with its spooky horror, top level stunt work and spectacular direction. The storyline follows Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), who finds the crypt of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) and flies her crypt via airplane when things go amuck. She is awakened and then controls Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) to crashes the plane. He crashes the plane to curse Nick who wakes up despite the plane crash. Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) then hunts down Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) who is also looking for Princess Ahmanet and is the only who can cure Nick. However, when Ahmanet is fully formed, Nick needs to stop her from destroying London and goes to extreme levels to defeat Ahmanet and save Jenny (Annabelle Wallis).Tom Cruise is versatile in his presentation of Nick Morton who cheats people because of his own selfishness. In the battle scenes, Cruise excels in his stunt work. Sofia Boutella as Princess Ahmanet is creepy, especially as The Mummy. She really suits the character of a princess relentless seeking power. Jake Johnson as Chris Vail provides comedic relief. Annabelle Wallis as Jenny Halsey clearly presents determination in tracking down Princess Ahmanet. However, she still falls to the trope of damsel in distress. Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll is my favorite character because he impressively presents the transition of his character.The direction by Alex Kurtzman is splendid. The pace from scene to scene is superb and kept me at the edge of my seat. My favorite scene is when Ahmanet attacks London. The special effects are outrageously impactful. My only problem is that the movie's finale is quite anti-climactic. Despite this flaw, Tom Cruise fans will rejoice at this movie.The movie's message is, even if you cheat others, you can always change to be selfless. Nick, though a thief, finds himself in the ultimate selfless sacrifice to save mankind. I give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 because of its intense horror. The movie releases in theaters on June 9, so check it out for one fast-paced thriller.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Mummy
93,justin-fencsak,Van Helsing was much better than this...,5,30 September 2017,"When it comes to monster movies, no one has done it better than Universal. The studio's monsters have left a legacy on audiences and filmmakers since the studio's inception more than 100 years ago, although recent efforts have failed to please critics and audiences. Case in point, the 2017 version of The Mummy, a franchise that peaked in 2001 with The Mummy Returns and dropped off like a cliff with the first entry in Universal's soon to be killed Dark Universe, which is this turkey. The mummy in said movie is the sexiest ever put to film, portrayed by Sofia Boutella, known mostly to American audiences in such big budget films as Kingsman 1 and Star Trek Beyond. As for the other star, Tom Cruise, he ain't no Brendan Fraser. So is Annabelle Wallis, who is currently dating Chris Martin of Coldplay fame. Skip this movie and watch the original Mummy trilogy.",The Mummy
94,Kingslaay,I had high hopes,6,29 June 2017,"I was very excited to see this film. I was a huge fan of The Mummy series that started in the late 90s and continued into the early 2000s. Brendan Fraser was a natural and everything worked in those films. However not everything works in this film despite a talented and likable cast. The film starts out strong but gradually loses credibility and intrigue as it goes on. There were so many elements being thrown in this film that one would struggle to piece it all together. The Dr Jekyll/Hyde component was excellent and perhaps badly used, even more so with the talent of Russell Crowe. Perhaps Dr Jekyll could played a more critical role and added mystery to the film. The fellow soldier Vail played by Jake Johnson could have been better used with more dry humor. The Mummy storyline could have been developed more as it seemed very thin and reused. An ancient Mummy coming to life to wreak havoc had already been exhausted in previous films. Sofia Boutella made a beautiful and terrifying Mummy but a better plot or story could have made it really stand out. I saw great elements that were used poorly and an overall plot that didn't come together too well despite decent acting.6.5/10",The Mummy
95,Rob_Taylor,This is the best they could manage?,6,21 July 2017,"This version of The Mummy, meant to launch an entire new cinematic universe (God I hate that term!) is not very convincing.For a start, Tom Cruise is entirely the wrong actor for this role. You needed someone much more self-aware of the ridiculousness of the material he was working with. Someone who could inject the right amount of humour into his lines and even his facial expressions. Someone with decent comedy chops and acting that could do the silliness justice. Someone like, say, Brendan Fraser! Oh, but wait, they made that version of the Mummy already. So it boggles the mind that this Cruise led vehicle tried so desperately hard to ape the action-adventure style of that earlier movie.Cruise is not Fraser. He seems incapable of doing anything but intense. Light-hearted is not his forte.But I can't blame him. It was a big role, with future outings in the contract. A good paycheck and he probably thought it might be a good film.However, it is not. The Mummy tries to be that older incarnation badly, but without the humour, it has nothing left but a monster and a load of action set-pieces. Nor did it go the other route and try to make it a tense, scary production. There is nothing frightening in this film. It is about as formulaic and by the numbers as you will get. As a starting point for a new franchise, it is sadly well below par.Also not helping, are the deliberate plagiarism of imagery from the Fraser movie. People having the life sucked out of them, a giant face in a sandstorm. It is all rather pitiful, to be honest. No doubt the makers of this film will call them ""homages"", but let's be honest, if your creativity only extends to thinking about what scenes you can steal from your predecessor, then your creativity is lacking.So, if we ignore the other (better) Mummy, does it stand up as a film in its own right? Not very well, I'm afraid. So much nonsense. Mercury that flows like water and drips from stalactites; a convenient Raise-Mummy-from-the-depths mechanic; underwater crusader tombs where the corpse hasn't rotted away to nothing over the centuries of immersion; air crash sites (in England) that rate no site security and don't have hordes of looky-loo's hanging around...You get the idea. It was written by someone for whom the real world is full of inconveniences. Inconveniences that can be overlooked in the name of plot convenience.All this, plus a tired looking Russell Crowe who is positioned to be this franchise's version of Nick Fury. In fact, given the nature of this movie, I suspect that Universal is going to try and make this the monster equivalent of the Marvel universe in every way possible. Crowe heads up an organisation of monster hunters that... you know what... I don't care. As with everything else in this film, it has been done before. In this case in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. At least that movie tried to have fun with its premise.As the start of a franchise, I can't help but think they would have been better off sticking with Dracula Untold. Not the best movie by far, but at least it tried to be different. This... this is just a textbook example of cut-n-paste film-making.If there is a choice of Mummy movies on TV in the future to watch, make this your last port of call. Yes, even the hideous CGI-Rock Scorpion King is better than this.SUMMARY: Let's remake The Mummy without someone charismatic and funny to lead it. Let's not make it scary or funny. Let's take ourselves far too seriously. Let's steal from those older movies though. Let's not pay attention to details. Let's not care.",The Mummy
96,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"I've debated for two days now, what to say about this one, and how to review it.",3,11 June 2017,"I wanted a horror film, what with the title, The Mummy, but what I got was a bizarre mix of genres, with action star Tom Cruise playing action star Tom Cruise, in a CGI-heavy, glossy fantasy/ scifi, allegedly somehow related to the old horror film from the '30s. Six screenwriters are credited: Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet wrote the screenstory together, then Jon Spaihts rewrote it, then David Koepp wrote the screenplay based on that screenstory, and Christopher McQuarrie rewrote the screenplay, and Dylan Kussman rewrote it again, and it seems like each writer wrote an individual character, without even reading what had been written previously, so it's no wonder it seems like each character comes from a different film.This entire film, while occasionally fun ( I liked the plane crash opening, and Cruise does well throughout ) , feels like it exists solely to set up a potential on-going series, without any substance or depth to build upon, and Crowe's character exists solely to explain the plot, likes he's reading the promotional press kit to the audience.Odd moments of ( unfunny ) comedy are thrown about, along with melodramatic garbage, in this overly complex plot, which begins well enough but quickly collapses under its own weight.",The Mummy
97,bkrauser-81-311064,What a Mess,4,16 June 2017,"The Mummy often feels like a nightmare. Not an interesting or memorable nightmare mind you, but the kind where you wake up mind boggled by the various avenues your stream of consciousness went sloshing around. It's just a mess - a huge, blundering, skin-festering, cliché-riddled, desperate mess.The first sign of trouble occurs before the film even has a chance to introduce us to its characters. The Universal logo inverts its blue/green globe revealing an eclipsed Earth, with ""Dark Universe"" scrawled in big, bold, overly-confident gold letters. The hubris of a promised extended universe is then immediately undone by Tom Cruise's soldier of fortune, Nick Morton and his compromising exchange with franchise female dead-weight Annabelle Wallis. From there the movie sputters on the same broadly drawn characters and sweeping barrage of action set pieces that would have felt more at home in the 1999 Brendan Fraser movie. Yet while that movie played up its clichés for cheeky laughs and cheap scares, this one wants you to take in the first twenty minutes like you're sucking down prized Kentucky mash.Once the smoke has cleared both figuratively and literally, the movie introduces us to its titular monster, a cursed, soul-sucking Egyptian princess played by a very game and oh so terribly utilized Sofia Boutella. As refreshing as it may seem to have a female mummy, Universal's only real ace in this faux franchise so far, having her play this specific monster with sexual moxie is like asking to make high cuisine out of coprophagia.But before we even see her face and can recognize her physical presence, we're forced to experience a farcical amount of brittle zombie attacks and really cheap looking CGI which makes you wonder where the $125 million it took to make this movie went. It clearly didn't go to making this movie look good. Principal photography took place in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England but it might as well have been shot in a hollowed out missile silo for all the under-lit, flat-looking and dull frames that assemble this movie. I was seriously wondering if I was watching a big-budget spectacle or an Underworld (2003-Present) movie.What's left of this quivering mass of insipidness has its neck snapped by the halfway mark. The movie stops cold to fully explore the minutia of Prodigium: The Dark Universe's analog to S.H.I.E.L.D. Only instead of it being a welcome distraction (the best possible scenario by this point), it more or less ends up being a sad reminder that Russell Crowe, the Oscar winning actor of high repute, actively doesn't give a s**t. And yes, Russell Crowe is in this movie and yes he does play Dr. Jekyl/Dr. Jekyl with a Cockney accent and yellow eyes. His choice to play the dual role like a drunken rendition of The Green Goblin is actually kind of admirable if you put the right lens against it - like Jesse Eisenberg in Baman V. Superman Ice Cream (2016) only with slightly less to do.I'm honestly at a loss at this point. Despite many attempts, not a single major studio has managed to match the chops of the Marvel Extended Universe, and I'm starting to think it's not even possible anymore. The Mummy has thrown both figuratively and literally the elastic man himself Tom Cruise at this problem and the only thing that came out of it is a busy, bloated and offensively dull movie with one of the most disappointing non-endings since Pushing Daisies (2007-2009).",The Mummy
98,mhorg2018,This is the reason Remakes shouldn't be made,1,22 August 2017,"This is why Hollywood stinks. They take an idea, already done to death really, have a terrible story written. Hire a fading star in Tom Cruise, whose ego ruins the film, pour money into it that they lose. This is just a terrible film on every level. If they'd actually come up with a decent idea AND perhaps did a little research in Egyptian history (it was a patriarchal society - no women ruled), and made things even remotely looked Egyptian, that might have been a start. Not wasting Russell Crowe might have been a good idea as well. Just another worthless remake that should be consigned to the dust bin of history. Utter Trash.",The Mummy
99,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Mummy"" (2017)- Perhaps the production was cursed? This new 'Mummy' is so wrapped up in contrived world-building, it simply cannot stand on its own. A complete mess.",2,11 July 2017,"You gotta give director Alex Kurtzman's 2017 reboot of the popular ""Mummy"" franchise some credit! Why? Well, because now there's no rational way anyone could possibly say ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" was the worst Universal ""Mummy"" movie... Nope. Not anymore. At least that one got a couple chuckles out of me here and there and had characters we knew and loved... This one? Well, let's just say this is one 'Mummy' that should have stayed buried...For 85 years, the ""Mummy"" franchise has been a staple in the world of horror. From the iconic and classic 1932 Boris Karloff masterpiece... through the wild Hammer flick and it's own follow-ups... and indeed to the incredibly popular 1999 Stephen Sommers film which retold the tale of the mummy's curse in a modern and adventurous way... ""The Mummy"" has always remained a recognized and relevant part of popular culture. So it should come as no surprise that when Universal decided to try their hand at creating a ""cinematic universe"" based on their various monster and creature franchises, a brand-new ""Mummy"" would serve as the first chapter.Unfortunately, this newest reboot is a complete mess. It's far too wrapped up in contrived world-building and completely unfocused on doing anything to allow it to stand on its own. Director Kurtzman and his small army of screenwriters have delivered a movie that honestly left me a bit dumbfounded. Yes, it boasts all the pretty special effects you come to expect from a modern-day blockbuster. Yes, the cast is made up of actors and actresses who typically light up the screen with electrifying performances. And yes, it does do some new and vaguely interesting things with a concept that some could argue has already reached its peak long ago. And yet... I did not for one single moment care about anything that was happening on-screen. It's a joyless slog that only exists to set up a potential franchise, and relies on tired old clichés and tropes to pad out its run-time. It's a glorified, feature-length commercial.Superstar Tom Cruise stars as US military officer and treasure- hunter extraordinaire Nick Morton, who accidentally helps to uncover an ancient tomb in modern-day Iraq. With the help of his painfully annoying comedic-relief sidekick Chris (Jake Johnson) and beautiful archaeologist Jennifer (Annabelle Wallis), Nick investigates his mysterious discovery and finds it to be something of a prison... As it contains the cursed sarcophagus of the vile Ancient Egyptian Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella)- a conniving and devious figure who sold her soul to the dark god Set and murdered several others in a ploy to ascend in power. Upon being released from her tomb, Ahmanet returns to life and launches a devious plot to take over the world. But Nick will not be alone in his fight against this dark force, as he soon comes to meet a mysterious doctor (Russell Crowe) who is part of an ancient monster-hunter organization known as the ""Prodigium""...""The Mummy"" really is a glaring example of failed potential. This particular franchise could benefit wonderfully from a modern retelling with new filmmaking technology and fresh blood behind the cameras. After all, that's what made the Hammer films and the Stephen Sommers movies work so well! But that's not what this is. This is studio-mandated, written-by-committee hack garbage, cynically conceived to cash-in on the trend of ""cinematic universes."" It's far too cold and clinical in its execution, lacking any real sense of humanity or artistry. Characters are written as one-note, dumbed-down to be massively appealing and completely non- challenging. Dialog is robotic and inorganic, only serving to either supply attempts at humorous quips or provide near-constant exposition. And the structure is suspect at best, feeling more like it's going down a corporate product checklist than trying to be an honest film. Opening flashback? Check! Set up the dashing hero and quirky comedic-relief sidekick? Check! Mandatory ""every 10 or so minutes action-scene""? Check!Too much of the movie is devoted to setting up the so-called ""Dark Universe"" and it feels really tacky and out of place. It's what gives the film that uncomfortable overlong-commercial feel. But fear not, because the rest of the movie is equally as bad, but in its own way. The film has a complete lack of focus or narrative structure, and the story-line is awkwardly confusing and often changes the rules whenever it's convenient for the screenwriters to write themselves out of a corner. Nothing really works together in a cohesive way... the writing is just mind-boggling. It's like everything that's there to set up the ""Dark Universe"" is soulless and dull, while everything else seems hastily cobbled together from about ten different drafts of the script. And as for Kurtzman's visual guidance? Uh... it's OK, I guess. It's basically visually indecipherable from most other generic studio- fare, and the few standout moments are the scenes lifted from previous ""Mummy"" movies. I wouldn't really recommend he quit his day-job to become a director...Oh, I almost forgot! What did I think of the cast? Nothing. Nothing at all. Because clearly none of them thought much of the film, based on how bored and dreary they seem. I guess maybe Tom Cruise got in a few zingers here and there? And I guess I could see Sofia Boutella being a good villain with a better script? But other than that and the fact I will actively avoid seeing movies with Jake Johonson in the future after finding him insufferable here... I don't have a single thing to say.Let's not stretch this out. ""The Mummy"" (2017) is a complete trainwreck. It's dull. It's lazy. And it's the very definition of hack-filmmaking. This series and this iconic monster deserve better. My recommendation? Just go back and watch the 1932 film or the 1999 flick. They're far superior to this corporate product nonsense. I give it a terrible 2 out of 10.",The Mummy
100,Luigi Di Pilla,It was really not necessary to create this film,4,26 November 2017,"I expected much more intelligence in developing this mummy movie. I was wrong. Hey, how it is possible that Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe decided to appear in this mess? The story went over from one scene to the other without any emotions. Some sequences were ridiculous and illogical when you know what I mean now. One star I give to the good special effects. The second star to the fine music, the third for the nice location, music and atmosphere. Finally, the fourth one is for I didn't felt asleep. All In all disappointing and no substance, just a great disaster. A film that never should have been done! Save your money and see therefore the best Mummy movie from director Stephen Sommers.",The Mummy
101,tomsview,Unwrap with caution,4,27 September 2017,"OMG! What happened? How can a ""Mummy"" film end up this bad? I really wanted it be good; the trailer looked like they'd nailed it.But no. This one got lost in a sandstorm or most probably in a brainstorm; just too many ideas crammed into one hapless movie.The danger with all ""Mummy"" movies since Hollywood mastered the brilliant special effects, is that you get hit with so many dazzling effects you eventually become numbed out.This one starts with promise with a bit of business about buried crusaders and the ancient Egyptians setting up yet another curse for the ages. This is in the form of Princess Ahmanet played by Sophia Boutella who makes a hot evil presence; up to this point we are going along just fine.Then we arrive in modern day Iraq and Tom is introduced. He plays Sergeant Nick Norton and in an exchange of Tomspeak with his buddy Corporal Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) we realise this ""Mummy"" is already pitched at a low level. Not long after, the mummified Princess Ahmanet is dug up, a bit too quickly to allow much tension to build, and a lot of weird stuff happens. Of course Princess Ahmanet wakes up mean as expected, but she releases dark forces that cause hallucinations all around. These are introduced with jumpcuts, bang, we are in the hallucination and then bang, we are back to the present; just like a movie in 1947. What happened to those rows of CGI computers? Maybe the inspiration for all this was a bad party experience by one or more of the filmmakers, but none of the hallucinations are all that clever in this film, they are just jarring.If they had just gone with a straight-through story and built the expectation and tension first it may have worked, but instead the bad ideas just keep coming, ""What about if we did this?"" It seems like the team who made the film reckoned no idea was a bad idea. That could explain how Russell Crowe was brought into the story as Dr Henry Jekyll no less. The last exchange between Tom and Jake Johnson's characters places ""The Mummy"" on a par with ""The Road to Morocco"", which just about sums up the chaotic thinking behind the whole thing.",The Mummy

103,arungeorge13,Dark Universe feat. Ethan Hunt! [+39%],4,2 September 2017,"Towards the climax of the first entry in Universal's Dark Universe, 'The Mummy', Nick Morton (played by Tom Cruise) exclaims ""I don't know what I'm doing!"". This is an apt gist of the entire movie. No one really acknowledges what they're doing in the film. First of all, wrong choice for protagonist. A 55 year-old Cruise playing a character on the lines of Nathan Drake from 'The Uncharted' series. What exactly was on the writers' minds when they wrote the character? He's a sergeant, a thief, loves being part of shoot-outs, enjoys infiltrating locations and indulges in flings with gorgeous women. Wow. Cruise seems to have fixated on his 'Ethan Hunt' persona so much that it almost feels like he's on 'autopilot' here. It takes a courageous director (like Doug Liman maybe?) to shut out the 'M.I' side of Cruise and lend some distinctiveness to his character. Unfortunately Alex Kurtzman isn't one. So much so that the viewer is inclined to feel for the antagonist Ahmanet (played by Sofia Boutella - a wild mesh of incredible seductiveness and menacing persona) and her unholy intentions than rooting for Sergeant Nick and Archaeologist Jenny (Annabelle Wallis). The romantic interplay between Nick and Jenny is where the film falls to its demise. It is not one bit convincing, the chemistry is lacking, the age-difference is too apparent, plus the writing never elevates either character.As Jenny, Wallis is never compelling as a striving archaeologist in pursuit of her goals and her constant undercurrent of admiration for a one-timer like Nick only make their affair a funny matter and her character, a sucker for (falsified) gestures. Come to think of it, even the bond between Fraser & Weisz in Sommers' Mummy movies appears immensely adorable in comparison. Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll, although taking up only like 15-20 minutes, manages to leave an impression with his screen-presence. He even towers over Cruise in the few scenes that they share. Boutella is a good choice for the antagonist, and one feels she would've done infinitely better under a veteran director. When the writing is already two-thumbs down, the CGI alone doesn't manage to accentuate the viewing experience. Cartoonish on most occasions, the visual effects barely showcase the grandeur of a big-budget production. 'The Mummy' is an assemblage of most things viewers have loved about supernatural monster flicks in the past, yet the coherency is lacking big time. Utterly unoriginal, and with very little thrills to boast of, this one bites the dust in no time.Verdict: High time Cruise stops Ethan Hunt-ing!",The Mummy
104,Abdulxoxo,Flawed but enjoyable,6,14 May 2021,"This film felt like, it was somewhat of a slow burner. The opening scene, which told us of Ahmanet's back story, wasn't all that interesting and just felt like needless exposition. The first half of the film was boring Eventually however, the excitement level grew, thanks largely to some impressive CGI and action scenes. Sofia Boutella was captivating. Whenever she was on screen she had a presence that not even her co-star could compete with. She brought sensuality to the role that disturbingly made a partly decomposed corpse far more attractive than it had any right to be. Of all the actors in this film, she's the only one who can walk away with her head held high. This is undeniably a Tom Cruise movie, as it's built around his usual tropes. Amazing 'Mission: Impossible' style stunts, charming rogue falling for a younger woman and of course there's running scenes. He had no chemistry with his love interest Jenny. I think it's questionable that he's still playing these type of roles. The film would have benefited from a younger actor. Russell Crowe who played Dr Jekll. He hammed it up big time, making the most of his screen time. But would also have been better if he were younger. Overall, the editing of the film is ok but it's the script that has to be blamed. The film's story is subpar, there is no actual flow in the story as well. Technically, the film is OK.",The Mummy

106,Screen_Blitz,Alex Kurtzman's attempts at rebooting the Dark Universe transpires to laughably flawed results not even Tom Cruise can redeem,3,9 September 2017,"With the action adventure trilogy of the same name starring Brendan Frasier far into the rear-view mirror, Hollywood has decided it is time to resurrect the Dark Universe (consisting of The Mummy, Frankstein, Dracula, etc) in the structure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with an introduction that binds more faithful to the classic source material. For director Alex Kurtzman, writer of the first two 'Star Trek' films and the first 'Transformers', however, such a pleasant feat is easier said than done. This reboot, bearing virtually no connections to the original trilogy other than a few general plot elements, pulls an unfortunate stunt of not only butchering its source material with a lumbering mess of a script, but oddly makes an unsettling accomplishment of sucking lead actor Tom Cruise dry of his charisma. The final result is a lifeless action fiasco that leaves the often-charismatic Cruise and his co-stars adrift in a sea of more unintentional laughter than pulse-pounding thrills. Although there are a few bursts of humor from Cruise and Johnson throwing in some goofy one-liners, most of which come to flaccid results. It is a film that is only entertaining in bits that come few and far in between. This film centers on an ancient Egyptian princess Ahmanet (played by Sofia Boutella) who was betrayed by her father and put to rest in her coffin 3000 years ago. Present day, military recons Nick Morton (played by Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (played by Jake Johnson) and fellow archaeologist Jenny Halsey (played by Annabelle Wallis) plunged in the underground where her coffin rests. When the trio unexpectedly awakens her evil spirit and Nick becomes cursed, it is up to them to defeat her as her soul begins to dominate Nick's body. The only one that can help them is Dr. Jekyll (played by Russell Crowe). The original Mummy movies starring Brendan Frasier were nothing resembling masterpieces (especially the third installment), they at least made a fortunate delicacy by providing solid guilty pleasure thrills to keep the adrenaline pumping. This one struggles to even make reach at level of entertainment. With the Alex Kurtzman working behind the wheel, what transpires is some action sequences showcasing Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson dodging bullets and later the former and Annabelle Wallis fending off against creepy monsters such as poisonous spiders and grotesque-looking ghouls from the prehistoric age, but with a severe shortage of thrills at hand. The action and the visual effects alone should be solid enough to keep the adrenaline fed. Unfortunately, this is an aspect that can barely even make up for all the overarching flaws that lie within the rudely inert script composed by a trio of writers including Christopher McQuarrie and David Koepp who have wrote scripts for other Tom Cruise incarnations in the past. That is not the say it is hard to get a kick out of watching Cruise perform his own stunts in one sequence involving a plane crash. The comedic banter between Cruise and Johnson, who is horribly miscast, never lands and the interaction between the stars including Wallis is sorely tainted by dialogue that is so cringe-inducing, it is hard to see how the actors are able to keep a straight face. And that certainly does not help when Cruise is desperately trying to land one comedic line after another after another, it only sucks the charm out of the normally-appealing star. As for Sofia Boutella, she is passable as the evil princess Ahmanet who completed with mostly make-up and CGI, while Russell Crowe, on the other hand, is given very little to do other than to serve as a setup for the next entry in the supposed Dark Universe franchise. The Mummy definitely does not have the Dark Universe on a healthy start nor does it leave a good note on the iconic lead star's career. Although the film may not have brought an immediate death warrant on this conceived franchise, it definitely leaves a blemish. This film is a disappointment and is only worth sitting through if you are willing to withstand a near two-hours in unintentional laughter while everything else goes awry.",The Mummy
107,cricket30,Tom Cruise continues to share with us his insights . . .,7,12 June 2017,". . . on Scientology, a growing religion where he serves as some sort of Vice Pope. In this follow-up to his EYES WIDE SHUT expose, Mr. Cruise provides further details about Scientologist Sacraments and Rituals throughout THE MUMMY. Though some if not most of these Services may strike the uninitiated as being akin to Tawdry Sex Orgies and Ultra-Violent Misanthropic Outbursts, viewers should keep such thoughts TO THEMSELVES. Chief American Trump has never said that he's NOT a Scientologist, and he sure looks and acts like one. Trump's position on Scientology is totally unknown to the American Public. If it turns out that Trump is a fellow Vice Pope to Cruise, or perhaps an even higher-ranking member of the Scientology Hierarchy, then ANY criticism of THE MUMMY's precepts will be tantamount to Hate Speech in the eyes of Our Government. Even a mildly negative review of THE MUMMY could be enough to trigger jack-booted FBI, CIA, and\or NSA thugs crashing through YOUR door!

108,Troy_Campbell,Dull and uninteresting despite its potential.,4,9 June 2017,"Arriving not long after the bland Jack Reacher sequel, this remake gives Tom Cruise a one-two punch of misfires. It's hard to tell whether this movie falls flat because it has miscast the Cruiser, or because it fails to capitalise on his charisma by surrounding him with b-grade trimmings. The first act is thrilling, opening with a rip-roaring set piece full of bullets and explosions before culminating in a spectacular free-falling aircraft sequence that sees Cruise and co-star Annabelle Wallis perform some mightily impressive stunts. But from there it is all downhill, and at a rapid rate. The tone and atmosphere shift dramatically, going from Indiana Jones-esque perilous delights to non-spooky Gothic terror that maximises its dreariness by hiding under a gloomy colour palette. Going hand in hand with the awfully drab cinematography is a sudden over-reliance on cheap CGI, the herky-jerky undead are tremendously off-putting for all the wrong reasons, whilst the London-destroying climax is a pure mess of pixels. The presence of a plethora of screenwriters is felt too, the main plot is disappointingly rote—especially considering Universal are hoping this kick starts their new intertwined monster universe—and the film's internal logic is flimsy at best, resulting in many of its own rules being broken for the sake of easy narrative progression. Cruise is in default enthusiastic mode, which enlivens proceedings sporadically, and Wallis is a likable hero full of pluck, however Russell Crowe is wasted as a shadowy task force leader and Sofia Boutella is reduced to hissing and shrieking as the eponymous ancient princess. The promising start demonstrates the potential The Mummy had to deliver a rollicking good time; unfortunately it only serves to highlight just how dull and unsatisfying the rest of the movie really is.",The Mummy

This movie really wasn't good. I blame whoever decided to cast Scientologist Tom Cruise. He does not belong here. He came off as too awkward, it'd be like putting Jason Statham in a Dracula movie (I hope this doesn't get to Hollywood) One good thing about this movie is that Sofia Boutella as Princess Ahmanet was pretty sexy. This movie tried to start a Classic Monsters Cinematic Universe, like the good 1930's horror films such as The Mummy, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman, and eventually bring them all together like The Avengers. Cool concept, but it's probably already crashed and burned thanks to this movie. Not even Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde could save it. Do yourself a favor, and skip this movie.

There were times when this felt like a good old fashioned B-Movie and there were times were it felt like something a lot more contemporary with adrenaline filled action shots. Tom Cruise got his standard 'running' sequences in, and Russel Crowe gets to fight. This is pretty much a chase, reveal, chase chase, fight film - and it's enjoyable to not make me want to leave the room. Some parts had action, some had fun, some where good chuckles. There wasn't that much depth that you had to concentrate or know backstories, it was what it was, but saying that, people with a keen eye could get a lot more from it (take for example the easter eggs pointing towards future Dark Universe films).I won't compare this to the 90's Mummy film's as they are clearly a different entity (and I thought they were too cheesy anyway). This film was ok, it kept me entertained and it kept my missus happy too. I'll happily give this a 7 out of 10 as it was a good date night movie.",The Mummy

116,rockman182,The Mummy (2017),5,3 August 2017,"The Universal Monster's Universe/Dark Universe is a thing now and we have to live with it. I do like a few of the original Universal monster films. Dracula, Frankenstein, Phantom of the Opera, Creature from The Black Lagoon; all quite enjoyable films. The trailers for The Mummy didn't exactly look amazing but it seemed like we could be getting a solid summer popcorn flick. Unfortunately, the film was dreary, overabundant with computerized imagery, and has nonsensical and weak story writing.The film is about the revival of an ancient Egyptian princess named Ahmanet. She is accidentally revived and is after Nick Morton (played by Tom Cruise), who she wants to make immortal or something like that. The plot of this film is actually pretty confusing and messy. They writing reeks of overwriting and over-complicating what should be really simple. The main weakness of this film is just how mediocre the writing is. There is no comical humor (as with the Brendan Frasier Mummy trilogy) the film doesn't have fun anywhere.I don't mind Tom Cruise action films but this and Jack Reacher 2 have really missed the mark. I liked Sofia Boutella as the lead mummy because she has an alluring and sometimes nefarious look in her eyes. Jake Johnson and what happens with his character and how he is present throughout was just weird. Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll is a bit of a head scratcher and his Mr. Hyde was a massive disappointment There is a lot of undead action and some of it looks great. For example, the smoke coming through the city and causing mass destruction. Everything else, not so much.The film just felt like a majorly shoe-horned attempt at creating this universe (obvious calls to the other monsters in the universe didn't exactly help). The ending sucks and isn't worth the payoff after wasting your time for a near two hours. The universe will have the time to get better. The DC Extended Universe was off to an awful start and then Wonder Woman came along and it put it back on track. It could happen here too. Lets learn from this mistake though. Ominous signs though as it seems no one is sure what to do with this Universe. Wasn't Dracula Untold supposed to be the start of it?

118,RforFilm,The Mummy has no clue on what kind of movie it wants to be. The only thing unraveled was that this is a Tom Cruise vehicle first.,4,15 June 2017,"Universal Pictures is in the middle of trying to bring back their classic monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, etc) within a shared cinematic universe. It is a daunting task, but not impossible as the original Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. creatures were in something of a shared worldloosely, but still shared to the point that it allowed crossovers. After a failed attempt to jumpstart the series with Dracula Untold, they had to go to the drawing board to see where they went wrong. A new plan is in play that is supposedly planned for a while, with the first movie being The Mummy.Unlike Dracula and Frankenstein, which were based off of novels, the original Mummy had no source material and was produced at around the same time King Tut was unearthed and the idea of curses being scary. Though it was something of a remake of Dracula with mummies, it was a hit an spawned several movies, including the Brendon Frasier centered Mummy franchise. While none of them were really great, they had a lot of atmosphere and carried that mythical tone that the other Universal monsters had. With an all new The Mummy, we'll see if is a good resurrection.In present day Iraq, Nick Morton (played by Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (played by Jake Johnson) are scavengers who raid to find ancient antiquities and sell them on the black market. The two accidentally stumble upon a tomb when an airstrike opens it. Nick, Chris, and archaeologist Jenny Halsey (played by Annabelle Wallis) explore it and discover that it's a prison for ancient Egyptians, but mostly for the Princess Ahmanet. The military extracts the sarcophagus and everyone gets on a plane to London, but not only does Chris seemed to by possessed, but the mummy's curse sends crows to take down the airplane. Though Jennifer was able to get a parachute, Nick ends up going down with the plane, but he miraculously wakes up in a morgue. It's discovered that Princess Ahmanet (played by Sofia Boutella) has awakened, is sucking the life out of people to make herself more human, and has placed a curse on Nick. Nick and Jennifer attempt to get away from this mummy, though are given help by a company called Prodiguim. Though Prodiguim's leader Dr. Henry Jekyll (played by Russell Crowe) insists that Nick's curse can be fixed, the mummy escapes and is intent on making the world hers again.I love the idea of trying to make the Universal monsters relevant again, but with The Mummy, what a bad way to start things. My problems with it stem not with how the monster is portrayed, but with the people around her. It feels like that The Mummy was written as a Tom Cruise vehicle rather then a monster movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the Mission Impossible franchise and a lot of his work, but not only is Cruise playing himself, but even he seems to be sidelined halfway for Dr. Jekyll.It's clear that The Mummy has no idea what kind of movie it wants to be; an adventure, a comedy, a horror, or fantasy. The comedy from the 1999 Mummy movie was campy, at least the whole movie kept a similar tone throughout. A character here might spout a joke while dark horror elements are going on. I wouldn't be surprised if the film had been reshot several times. Going back to the tone, the film was actually the strongest when it was trying to be legitimately scary, with it's use of shadows and dark corners. I respect that they tries to make the mummy a scary character again, but the film needed more focus. I'll give this movie credit for making the mummy the best character in the whole movie. She's intimidating and her design looks good. Sofia Boutella might have given a performance that rivals Boris Karloff, had more attention been given to her. What's weird is that we get a long backstory of her in Ancient Egypt and her rise to power and eventual mummification, but that all stops the moment when Russell Crowe comes in to build exposition for more monster moviesand it goes on for a half hour before The Mummy resumes its story.I'll give this four mummies out of ten. While it's not a disaster, its clear that The Mummy has too many cooks in the kitchen trying to make it several styles. If your looking for a simple action movie with horror elements, they are there, but its rarely consistent. Lets hope that Universal can find the right tone they need or there'll be no monster mash in the future.",The Mummy
119,juliankennedy23,Mummy do you think they'll drop the bomb.,5,30 March 2018,"The Mummy: A gender-swapped Lara Croft(Tom Cruise)finds a cursed mummy (An excellent Sofia Boutella) while looting treasures in Iraq one step ahead of Isis (The terrorist army not the Egyptian Goddess). Cruise and his mandatory love interest (Annabelle Wallis) fly the Mummy back to London. The mummy escapes and Cruise finds himself recruited by a shadowy organization led by Russel Crowe to get the Mummy back before the world ends or something.The Good: The Mummy has some pretty good scenes all conveniently located for your viewing pleasure in the first forty minutes or so of the movie. The first forty minutes has a good breezy pace, Cruise's character seems fun and well thought out, the action scenes are great and the mummy protagonist is a sexy and dangerous foil. One can seriously start to wonder why this fun movie got so much critical flack?The Bad: And then Russell Crowe shows up. Dr. Jekyll would argue that Mr. Crowe does a fine job but is let down by a poor script and characterization. Mr. Hyde would say Russell is a large ham who makes a poorly thought out character even worse. While I agree with Hyde I don't think anything could have saved this character. It is simply bad because it exists in this story.Crowe scenery chewing isn't the only thespian stumble. We also have Annabelle Wallis as the least charismatic Cruise love interest since... well maybe ever. There is furniture in this movie I am more invested in than this character. If a bad guy ties her to a table we're more worried that no one is using a coaster.For a movie called The Mummy, the titular character doesn't seem to get a lot to do after they settle in London. Some (including the studio) blame Cruise for hogging the limelight but in reality, it is the world building with Prodigium, which is supposed to be the Scooby gang that links all the Dark Universe movies together, that sucks up all the running time and all the films energy. (The Mummy was supposed to be the first of a series of Dark Universe films that are threatening us with, among other things, Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man. Fortunately, the whole enterprise seems to be on life support so expect another reboot soon.)There are other fails. The Crowe's Jekyll/Hyde does that thing where Jekyll speaks with an upper-class accent so we know he is good while Hyde pours on a cartoonish lower-class Cockney accent, that would make Dick Van Dyke blush, to let us know he is now evil. (If one thinks about it it really should be the opposite). This seems to be taken from the Dr. Jekyll musical of all things and Crowe does seem to threaten to sing Les Mis' Stars at any monument.The movie um... finds inspiration from other films as well, everything from The League of Extraordinary Gentleman (See Prodidium above) to An American Werewolf in London where the film out and out copies entire scenes.In Conclusion: It is rare to see a movie, let alone the supposed start of an entire Universe filled with tent poles, fly off the rails so badly. Like Superman Vs Batman it seemed more concerned letting us know about upcoming projects and setting up ""the Universe"" than just being a good movie so we would see another. Raider's of the Lost Ark did not try to create a franchise with its film. It just was a very good movie that made people want more.They had a great villain, a solid action hero and a decent budget. They easily could have made a fine Mummy film. And if it was successful they could have followed it up with some mediocre sequels that take place in China and have a new actress playing the wife in the third one. Heck, you could even do a spin-off series with horrible CGI Scorpion Man hybrid that eventually goes straight to video. The blueprint was there you just had to follow it.",The Mummy

121,Anurag-Shetty,Your money's worth of entertainment.,8,12 June 2017,"The Mummy is the second reboot of the 1932 film of the same name. It is also the start of Universal Pictures' Dark Universe, which is a shared universe for all the monsters of yore like, Dracula, The Invisible Man, Frakenstein's Monster & many more. Military personnel & a group of explorers dig up an ancient tomb. What lies in the tomb, awakens in the present day & unleashes unspeakable horrors upon our world. The Mummy is a great movie. It is a good start to the Dark Universe. However, it had the potential to be flawless. Director Alex Kurtzman doesn't keep a fixed tone for the film. It starts off as a horror movie, then an action film, then a comedy & finally back to horror. This prevents the film from achieving perfection. It tries to do too many things at once. The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are mind blowing, with my favorite being the plane sequence. The comedic situations work, for the most part. However, The Mummy(1999) starring Brendan Fraser, was more hilarious. There are quite a few jump scares in the movie. Only one or two of these have the desired effect. The rest are very clichéd & expected. Tom Cruise is the highlight of the film, as Nick Morton. Cruise's stunts & one-liners get you totally involved in the proceedings on screen. Russell Crowe is fantastic as Dr. Henry Jekyll. Annabelle Wallis is superb as Jenny Halsey. Sofia Boutella is spectacular as Ahmanet. Boutella continues to give us unforgettable performances after Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014) & Star Trek Beyond(2016). Jake Johnson is effective as Chris Vail. Courtney B.

123,fernandoschiavi,"This new adaptation does not amuse, it does not scare, it does not start a new arc of films well",5,5 July 2020,"When Universal Studios decided to start plans for its ""Dark Universe"", in a series of interconnected films of its most famous monsters, similar to the shared universe Marvel, it seemed to be a really incredible idea and of extreme potential. The first film chosen by the studio to start the saga was ""The Mummy"", a new version of the classic of the 1930s and which also won a successful version in 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.The intention was already that ""Dracula Untold"" and ""I, Frankenstein"" were part of this shared universe. The quality (or lack thereof) of these films, however, spoke for itself, causing Universal to postpone its project, which, now, in 2017, wins its first official entry, entitled to a name, Dark Universe being shown soon after the studio. Much falls on the shoulders of The Mummy, therefore, the newest reboot of the franchise after no less than nine Universal-only films since 1932 - a figure, therefore, more than established in the popular imagination. Initially, the studio called Andres Muschietti to direct the remake, which later disconnected from the project. After Andres Muschietti left the direction of the Mummy film, Universal Pictures put in the direction of Alex Kurtzman who had also been hired to make Universal's monster movie franchise, which he planned to do in addition to the mummy films, Van character films. Helsing, Werewolf, Invisible Man, among others. Filming then took place in Oxford, Surrey, London and Namibia.This new version is extremely contestable. Here, we have fled the first half of the 20th century and see ourselves today. The work begins by telling us the story of the mummy in question, the daughter of the pharaoh who had made a pact with Set, but who ended up being mummified alive and buried far from Egypt. Having finished this story, which works as a prologue to the work, we left for Iraq, where the story begins to unfold. The script had a great risk that the text would show a greater concern for establishing the shared universe than developing its own story and that is exactly what happens. Everything that involves these characters not directly linked to the mummy sounds disconnected from the main plot to the point that we feel as if we are watching two films in one, with entirely dispensable sequences and that add absolutely nothing to the main plot. Do they open the way for the establishment of future films? Of course, but at the cost of expanding the narrative, making it tiring and fragmented. Within these ""extra"" sections, we met dr. Henry Jekyll, played by Russell Crowe, who brings us a really scary approach to the character, but that just doesn't match the rest of the work. It sounds like the movie is paused and suddenly another story starts to be told, making this bridge very bad, we are abruptly introduced to the new, and apparently meaningless, world of Universal's monsters. Not that the integration of a film into a universe is necessarily a bad thing, the problem here is that it should be done in such a forced and anti-climactic way, to the point that, if removed, the plot is not needed at all. On the positive side of this crossover between monsters, it is possible to remove the Prodigium organization and the easter eggs released by Crowe's office. If you still don't know how to work these properties, at least Universal has set it up in a way that allows you to present several other creatures with greater ease.
The incongruence of the text starts right at the introduction, with the story of the princess, it is born incoherent from the moment when it is never clear why she needs to appeal to an evil deity, in order to become queen. As well as the mutant personality of the character of Cruise in the plot is discrepant. He can either be a boon to sleep with a girl and steal her the next morning, or he can be a great hero and save this same girl by putting her life ahead of yours. As these changes are not at all subtle or organic, it becomes difficult to believe in the protagonist's motivations and resolutions. Cruise, by the way, does not bring anything new and even shows some tiredness. There is an attempt to insert doses of humor throughout the narrative, especially through the personality of the protagonist, but the script does not seem to know whether to decide which atmosphere to focus on. The result is a film without an identity, which moves through genres without establishing itself in any of them - we have neither a horror film nor an adventure film, but a faulty hybrid of the two. You can say with conviction that the role of ""seductive scoundrel and joke"" may not be the beach of our Hollywood hero. And it's not! Totally out of his comfort zone, Cruise disappoints and probably delivers the worst performance of his career. If Cruise doesn't find his tone, the rest of the cast suffers from even greater deficiencies. Crowe is pathetic in his version of ""Doctor and Monster"", as well as Annabelle Wallis, she delivers a very old-fashioned ""girl"": beautiful, permanently well made up and always willing to be saved by a man on duty.Sofia Boutella is, without a doubt, the best aspect of the film, with a penetrating look that lends a distinguished fury to the antagonist. The makeup work also draws attention, being original and showing a lot of attention to details, such as your nails and the bandages that surround it. In fact, the film trusts this portrait of the creature and soon dispenses with computer graphics in its decrepit form, favoring the work of the actress. When changing the sex of the monster, now experienced by Sofia Boutella, The Mummy puts itself in the position to explore new possibilities and bring a different vision to the tale. It is not what happens. The script focuses more on Tom Cruise's curse and transformations than on ex-princess Ahmanet's dilemmas. Boutella, although well in the film, is here only a charismatic and well-made face, which serves to set the future of Nick, the true protagonist of the film. Were it not for the few moments of suspense at the beginning of the appearance of the Mummy, it would be possible to say that the girl is in the background in history, since Dr. Jekyll also appears.The need to do something great, exaggerated, guaranteeing extraordinary powers to the antagonist, but which are only used briefly, without any explanation. Photography, which is excessively dark at certain points, also does not help, devaluing all the work of makeup and production design, since we are unable to see almost anything. However, the feature has production merits. Some scenarios are well explored and it is well filmed as a whole (although a considerable part is lifeless, and the lifeless is not a metaphor for the situation). Highlight for the plane scene: tense, causes dilemmas in the characters and has a busy action, it is worth mentioning the 3D there, just there, by the way.... With more situations like that, the film would gain new life and be much more profitable. The beginning of the plot - at the present time - slips into something like that, at the moment when our heroes are cornered. The first act, by the way, is the best in the film. Basically, until the title character actually appears, the film works in a certain way. The second act is drowsy and the third is lazy - the latter, triggered, the worst.Owner of some good action scenes - like the zero gravity plane -, full of predictable scares and expressions of astonishment beyond Tom Cruise's bizarre, as well as the star's unexpected lack of comic timing, the new ""The Mummy"" too much failure. It does not amuse, it does not scare, it does not start a new arc of films well and, to make matters worse, it does not surpass in quality any of the several previous adaptations of the same story. Alex Kurtzman's great sin is not to arouse urgency or tension in any sequence of confrontation and danger. The Mummy's own threats and powers have no impact, although the scope of her magic is clear. Kurtzman is unable to represent the power of the character on screen, which has an interesting look, but is limited to resurrecting soldiers and conjuring sandstorms.
The twisted start of this new world is due to the poorly structured replication of recipes explored by Disney and Warner, for example, in the cases of Marvel and Godzilla / Kong. The difference is in the command and idealization of these proposals. While some have a signature and care in the narrative and construction of heroes and villains, others think only of emulating a recipe that is not infallible - and that is the case with A Mummy. The production company, which introduced the first effective shared universe of theaters so many years ago, seems to want to shoot everywhere, without hitting any target. When deciding to focus more on external elements than those essential to the quality of the film itself, everything ends up becoming a huge mess, bringing us a tiring narrative, which makes it seem like the work has more than three hours, although it has less than two.After the monumental failure at the box office of the new version of The Mummy, Universal gave up on creating a universe shared with all the classic monsters, including Dracula and Frankstein. The studio initially wanted to bring all the monsters together in a series of films that would link up with the Marvel style. The idea didn't work out and the first two films in this franchise were financially disastrous. Because of this, Universal proposed new paths for the franchise, which will now have isolated films, made by directors with a subscription and no connection between one and the other.",The Mummy

125,dave-mcclain,"""The Mummy"" is ridiculous and just plain dumb.",1,9 June 2017,"""The Mummy"" (PG-13, 1:50) is the first film in Universal Studios' modern Dark Universe franchise. And why not? There's a lot of money to be made taking characters and properties with an established fan base and turning them into a string of modern feature films. Marvel Studios has its Marvel Cinematic Universe, Warner Bros. has the DC Extended Universe and Disney has Star Wars. Universal's plan to get in on the game? Updating the horror, suspense and science fiction movies that they've held the rights to since before movies could talk. As the silent film era waned and talkies replaced them, Universal released classics such as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (both starring Lon Chaney, Sr.), followed by ""Dracula"" (starring Bela Lugosi), then ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Mummy"" (both with Boris Karloff). Universal's original Dark Universe series continued through the 1950s, with several other monsters – and sequels to their more popular movies. Then there were sporadic cinematic appearances of these characters in early 21st century remakes, such as the underrated ""Dracula Untold"" (2014), ""The Wolfman"" (2010), ""Van Helsing"" (2004) and, of course, Brendan Fraser's ""Mummy"" movies (1999 and 2001). At Universal, in the mid-late 2010s, a plan emerged and the umpteenth incarnation of ""The Mummy"" is the first step. The studio gave Tom Cruise the task of doing for their Dark Universe what Robert Downey, Jr. did for Marvel, Gal Godot (finally) did for DC and J.J. Abrams did for Disney.2017's ""The Mummy"" is the first in which the title character is a woman, and it's true what they say: Hell hath no fury like a woman mummy scorned. Or, in this case, denied the throne. In her fictional backstory set in ancient Egypt's Middle Kingdom, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) is next in line to rule Egypt, until the pharaoh's new wife gives him a son. Ahmanet retaliates by killing all three of them and making a deal with the devil, whom the ancient Egyptians called Set. This god of the desert, storms, disorder and violence gives Ahmanet super powers and all she has to do is sacrifice her lover by stabbing him with a special knife so Set can inhabit his body. But before she can complete the act, she is captured by the palace guards and then transported 1,000 miles away to Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) where she is mummified and buried alive in a large underground cavern, surrounded by statues of gods to guard her, hieroglyphic warnings of danger if her tomb is disturbed and liquid mercury, to weaken her evil powers.Cruise plays Nick Morton, a former soldier who is now a soldier of fortune, stealing antiquities for personal profit Indiana Jones without scruples. Nick is in war-torn Iraq with his partner in crime Chris Vale (Jake Johnson) looking for the legendary tomb of Ahmanet. They find it, with the help of a map that he stole from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), (after sleeping with her) and a well-timed, well-placed U.S. military air strike called in to disperse armed insurgents. When Jenny catches up with Nick and sees what he has unearthed, she demands that an Army colonel (Courtney B. Vance) use one of his helicopters to lift Ahmanet's sarcophagus out of its resting place and put in on a plane to fly it to London. On the way, Chris becomes possessed by Ahmanet's evil, a flock of birds flies through the cockpit and the plane crashes, with Nick still aboard. Yet he survives. British scientist Dr. Edward Jekyll (Russell Crowe, prepping for a Dark Universe movie of his own) tells Nick that Ahmanet has chosen him to help her and Set take over the world. Then, Ahmanet escapes, chaos ensues and only Nick can stop it.""The Mummy"" is as dumb and ridiculous as it sounds. It doesn't have the scariness of Boris Karloff's films or the fun of Brendan Fraser's. This one's attempted scares come from its visual effects (which aren't much better than in 1999's ""The Mummy"") and its attempts at fun come from misplaced whimsy in the characters and supposedly comedic moments and lines that aren't very funny and are so frequent that they distract from the main plot, which is supposed to be tense and frightening. Screenwriters David Koepp (writer of several hits over the previous few years), Christopher McQuarrie (another successful screenwriter, who also directed ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" and ""Jack Reacher"") and Dylan Kussman (a career actor, co-writing his first movie) throw together elements that have worked in recent horror and superhero movies, but they end up with a confused mess of a story.Director Alex Kurtzman (a long-time writer and producer who is directing his first major movie) can't seem to make sense of the script either or strike any kind of reasonable tonal balance or give his actors any kind of direction that makes their characters likable or even believable. Clearly trying to follow Marvel's template for its uber-successful MCU films, this movie instead flounders worse than the early Batman and Superman movies of the DC Extended Universe. Unless Universal quickly finds its equivalent of ""Wonder Woman"", the Dark Universe franchise is in trouble. In this version of ""The Mummy"", Ahmanet was buried for 5,000 years before she emerged, every bit as disagreeable as before. I'd suggest burying this movie for 5,000 years, but it probably wouldn't get better with age either. ""D+""",The Mummy
126,joebloggscity,The Mummy unrwapped again but the real horror is Russell Crowe's accent...,5,25 February 2018,"I'd like to begin talking about what this movie was like, but really the one abiding memory is that of Russell Crowe, just what was he on? Where did that changing accent come from? The faux British voice was cringing, off-putting and really overwhelmed much good in this film, it was the real horror in this movie. It was unintentionally comically bad, and surely must be up for Razzies!Back to the movie, we have a reboot of which ends up with a Mission Impossible cum The Mummy (1990s) storyline. Actually the story is fine and follows standard as per the old 1990s series, and Tom Cruise is excellent as the lead (seems to improve with age). Anyhow, his co-stars don't help, with his lead lady really poor, couldn't see the point of her. Just take my word for it. Rachel Weiss had a great sassy character in her run as the lead lady in the franchise, why couldn't they have done the same here.The best part is the dark nature of the movie, and you got to give credit for it. They want more than just the comedy feel as it was. Yet it's not wholly horror, and seems to get itself stuck in a no man's land between family-ish fair and hammer which doesn't sit well. They want a new dark universe of movies? This is more grey than black, but I hope they push for more.It has had poor reviews, and I follow in that line as I struggled to go with the action and spills & thrills. Yet it isn't as bad as some make out. As a Saturday night film in the cinema or on the box, it's quite good, but a single viewing is sufficient. Nothing more to see. In fairness, the old Hollywood horror movies were rarely ever as spectacular as some seem to wish to remember.It's overall okay for a viewing, but hopefully will help to lead to a new line of films in the genre. It needs it.",The Mummy
127,Vivekmaru45,Just like Alien Covenant another misfire from Hollywood.,3,14 September 2017,"Hollywood is really stating to lose its magic. This film is so bad, it makes the 1999 movie seem like a masterpiece. Even the cast was better with Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo. Though people view Tom Cruise in a different light than Brendan Fraser. Arnold Vosloo was phenomenal as Imhotep in The Mummy and subsequent sequel The Mummy Returns(2001). This film is supposed to be a reboot of the 1991 film.Plot: In 1127 A.D., several English crusader knights bury an Egyptian ruby within the tomb of one of their number. In present-day London, a construction crew discovers the tomb and a mysterious man is authorized to investigate the site.In a flashback to the New Kingdom era, Princess Ahmanet is first in line to succeed her father Menehptre until his second wife gives birth to a son. Determined to claim the throne for herself, Ahmanet summons Set, who agrees to help her if she uses a dagger to transfer his spirit into a corporeal form. After killing her family, Ahmanet attempts to sacrifice her lover to Set but is captured by her father's priests and condemned to be mummified alive for eternity. Her sarcophagus is buried in Mesopotamia and submerged in a pool of mercury so that her monstrous form will not escape.In present-day Iraq, Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail, while on Long Range Reconnaissance for the U.S. Army, discover the tomb of Ahmanet after calling in an airstrike on an insurgent stronghold. Jennifer Halsey, an archaeologist who had a one-night stand with Nick, arrives and investigates the tomb, correctly concluding that it is a prison. After extracting Ahmanet's sarcophagus from a pool of mercury, Nick's superior, Colonel Greenway, places the sarcophagus on a transport plane headed to England.Verdict: Casting is not impressive. Tom Cruise should retire, he just doesn't have it any more. Sofia Boutella as Princess Ahmanet does not even begin to compare with Vosloo's Imhotep. The special effects are laughable even by today's standards. Sound effects are not that impressive along with the run-of-the-mill cinematography.

128,MihaiSorinToma,An average movie with Tom Cruise,7,14 June 2017,"When a soldier decides to go antique hunting, thus deviating from his mission, he encounters an ancient tomb, with no knowledge of its existence or significance. Unbeknownst to him, he had just unleashed an ancient evil which at first started by showing visions into broad daylight, only to get worse until the truth is unveiled, leaving little options of salvation.It's a movie which, from my opinion, you go to see because of Tom Cruise and nothing else. The plot wasn't interesting before seeing it, only to prove me right afterwards. It's quite linear and predictable, almost mediocre, but the worst part about it is that it leaves the impression that it wasn't taken seriously and as a result, it doesn't take itself seriously. It's like they wanted it to be a comedy but suddenly decided to transform it into an action flick, leaving some awkward jokes here and there. It's not very good in visual effects either, mostly because it doesn't have much. Except the zombies, the two pupiled eyed mummy and a sandstorm, there's nothing to catch your attention.Don't get me wrong, it's not as bad as its overall rating, but you could have hoped for a better implementation from every possible aspect. Nothing is as good as it could have been done with this one, and you can clearly see this reflected in the final product.",The Mummy
129,swilliky,A false start of the Dark Universe and a dull action adventure,5,11 June 2017,"Digging up an old franchise and kicking off a new Dark Universe, the Mummy had a lot on its undead shoulders but looks to have failed the task. The film starts off at a rushed past quickly giving us a back story from Dr. Henry Jeckyll (Russell Crowe) and a brief backstory of Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). The movie jumps to Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and his partner Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) searching for artifacts and killing faceless insurgents before calling in an airstrike that unearths the burial place of the mummy. They continue to accelerate the pace not taking any sort of precautions as Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) explains everything and they belay down into a cave where the mummy is being stored in mercury. Director Alex Kurtzman has no time for procedure moving rapidly onto the next set piece.They move the sarcophagus to the plane and take off ahead of a sandstorm. Chris becomes possessed from a spider bite and kills an underused Colonel Greenway (Courtney B. Vance). The zero gravity scene has Jenny parachuting away as Nick goes down with the plane. He wakes up in the morgue wondering why he's still alive and unharmed. In a brief moment of horror, Ahmanet gathers up an army of each investigator of the plane crash. Jenny contacts Dr. Jekyll but first Nick wants to find Ahmanet's body so that he can convince himself he's not cursed. He keeps seeing a dead Chris talking to him about what Ahmanet wants.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Mummy

This film has a completely new story which while being engrossing and action packed as you would think of Tom Cruise films does have a certain enjoyment which I honestly didn't expect. Intact to be honest I enjoyed this film far better than Jack Reacher and the latest Mission Impossible!One thing which strikes me with all of these films involving super natural powers is the time it takes for then to start welding said powers, as we saw with X Men the mummy in that took the entire film and as far as I saw in this film the MUMMY only called upon her destructive powers once causing a hurricane in London, why? In some ways the story got lost for me as it was less about saving the world and too much on how Tom Cruise was going to save himself.Watchable at the cinema, brain fodder.Guaranteed sequel.",The Mummy
131,jrarichards,"Cohesive in terms of its own logic, it does the job with some style",8,15 June 2017,"It's pointless to judge this piece from Alex Kurtzman in any other company except its own. And of course it is not that long ago that we (or I anyway) enjoyed the Brendan Fraser-Rachel Weisz-John Hannah series of ""Mummy"" films. The 2017 offering has quite a bit of common ground with those, is not noticeably worse, and crucially it has a completely modern setting, as opposed to a 1920s-1930s one, and that fact also ensures some separation from Indiana Jones movies, notwithstanding considerable similarities in tone and concept.What all three share is a determined attempt to temper horror and creepiness with humour, and Tom Cruise as soldier/looter of antiquities Nick Morton is as good at that as we might expect. Here he's neatly sandwiched between the beautiful (and good) archaeologist Jenny Halsey (pretty well done by Annabelle Wallis) and the incredibly attractive personification of evil from ancient Egypt Princess Ahmanet (as ""played"" - in rather few words and plenty of action - by an extremely memorable Sofia Boutella). This eternal triangle setup is very fundamental and well-presented, and makes the time-honoured (if clearly still significant) ethical and moral Faustian-type dilemmas crystal clear - indeed all the more so as Morton is for much of the film wrestling between good and evil in himself. Indeed, he is actually still alive because he has been rescued by evil. The power of love and lust to lead people astray are shown very clearly, but - though Morton of course does the right thing - there is A LOT of temptation from the dark side on the way...Happily, this triangle expands at times to a square, thanks to Russell Crowe's performance as Dr Henry Jekyll - yes that one (and with Mr Edward Hyde lurking within him). Apparently, his potions have kept him going since Victorian times and have left him a multi-talented genius, who harnesses the expertise and equipment of the Royal Society to keep Britain and the world safe from evil. It's clever and fun to have Stevenson's character revived, or rather maintained (also quite a lot of fun when Crowe gets to do Hyde), and brings this aspect of the film firmly within the (updated) tradition of Victorian Gothic ""mad scientist"" horror. (Those thinking into this more deeply will realise that, for all the dark magic surrounding him, Cruise's Morton within the world of the film is a real figure of our times. Thus for him, as for us, Jekyll and Hyde are nothing more than literary characters, and it seems at the outset at least, that Cruise is playing it as if he were indeed being confronted with something from a story ... and that's a rather witty kind of in-joke for all concerned!) The first moments of the story's necessary transfer to London offer a visually-glorious and convincing big-screen experience, but this is not the only geographical beauty on show, as there are several stunning desert scenes to enjoy. More generally, archaeological discovery scenes portraying both London and Iraq are splendid and authentic-looking (at times even accompanied by rather erudite script), and it's sure that the first part of the film flows flawlessly in line with its own logic (even drawing on the current penchant in certain countries for most kinds of heritage other than that of fundamental Islam to be destroyed). This adds an extra topicality and poignancy to the whole thing, and Courtney Vance does a nice job balancing the scientific and military priorities as Col. Greenway. This part of the film ends with a rather spectacular helicopter transfer of our Mummy's sarcophagus to a ""safer"" place...There is plenty of death and destruction, to be sure (and it does get a bit wearing, even if the film wisely comes in at under 2 hours); and there are many scary moments. However, it must be said that FAR more is implied than actually shown, and the fact that a number of zombie-like characters are running around is tempered by a complete lack of closeups, dim lighting and so on. Nevertheless, while adults will mostly relish the creepiness, some children might find themselves close to their limits. The aforementioned, and more insidious, ""attractiveness of evil"" side of things represents quite another matter. But then all of us have to deal with that throughout our lives, I guess...Overall, the 2017 ""Mummy"" is shallowish (of course), but slick and mostly convincing. Mostly, it's also fun. For veterans it will seem familiar (even very much so), but can still offer a new scale and visual impression sufficient to make the thing worthwhile in terms of novelty. Several extra nice touches leaven the mix ... and there are also the wonders of Sofia Boutella!",The Mummy
132,abisio,Entertaining mess,7,12 June 2017,"I saw a restored (and colorized version) of the original 1932 version, with Boris Karloff, and it was terrifying. After a few misses; I saw the 1999 which worked more as a comedy and still somewhat kept the spirit of the original. The later sequels not so. However this time; the Tom Cruise version is the kind of mess with a few interesting ideas and unnecessary over exposition. The Mummy being a woman is in fact a brilliant idea and the cast of Sofia Boutella is perhaps the greatest achievement of the movie. Sadly the adding of Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hide only adds a pale action scene that do very little for the movie. I assume Universal is trying with this DARK UNIVERSE to make some kind of monsters' crossover as Marvel and DC comics did with its superheroes. The idea is not bad; but the execution of this movie does not open a promising path. Tom Cruise as always does his best; he supports a lot of beatings stoically and his character is not as perfect as his previous ones (well it is heroic and generous but at least a little more humble). In terms of action; there are a few intense scenes; however in between a lot of exposition and unnecessary dialog makes the movie lag until the next action sequence. Russel Crowe as always delivers; but does not seem to convinced. Annabelle Wallis does what she can with a limited character; but is Sofia Butella who really shines as seductress and deceived woman. In brief; is entertaining and well produced; more horror movie than comedy but far from the 1932 and 1999 versions.",The Mummy
133,bob-the-movie-man,Crushingly Mediocre,3,24 June 2017,"I'd read the bad reviews, but thought ""Hey, it's Tom Cruise - how bad could it be?""   The answer is, ""Pretty bad"".It's an ominous sign when a film starts with a voice-over (even if done by the sonorous tones of Russell Crowe). Regular readers of this blog will know I generally abhor voice-overs: it invariably belies a belief by the scriptwriters that they think the audience are too damn stupid to join up the plot-dots themselves. Here we portentously walk through the ancient Egyptian backstory of princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service""; ""Star Trek Beyond"") cursed to become the titular Mummy. We then skip forward to the present day and the film settles down, promisingly enough, with scavenging adventurer Nick Morton (Cruise, in Indiana Jones mode), discovering a lost Egyptian temple in war-torn modern-day Mesopotamia that for the sake of the world should have stayed lost.But after an impressive plane crash (with zero G scenes filmed for real in a ""Vomit Comet"") the plot dissolves into a completely incoherent mush. With B-movie lines forcing B-movie acting performances,  the film lurches from plot crisis to plot crisis in a similar manner to the comically lurching undead Zombie-like creatures that Ahmanet has sucked the life out of.  (After 110 minutes of this, I know how they feel!)What were actors of this calibre doing in this mess? When I first saw the trailer for this, and saw that Cruise was in it, I thought this felt like an unusual career misstep for the megastar. After seeing the film, I'm even more mystified. Nick Morton is supposed to be an immoral bad guy. Immoral bad guy?? Tom Cruise?? Nope, you lost the audience on that one in the first ten minutes. Cruise, who is STILL only a year younger than I am (damn him, for real!) is still in great shape and must spend ALL his time in the gym. There must be a time soon coming though where he gets to a ""Roger Moore in View to a Kill"" moment where these action hero roles just no longer become credible anymore.And what was Russell Crowe, as a famous / infamous (yes, both!) doctor from literature doing in this? His character's involvement in the plot was almost completely inconsequential. In fact his 'affliction' only serves as a coincidental diversion (how convenient!) for bad Mummy- related action to happen. His character has no backstory and seems to serve only as a backbone for Universal's ""Dark Universe"" franchise that this movie is supposed to launch. (Good luck with that Universal after this stinker!)  Surely it would have made more sense to have the first film in the series to be the origins story for Crowe's character and the organisation he sets up. This would have made far more sense.Annabelle Wallis, who is sweet and ""only"" 22 years his junior, plays Cruise's love interest in the film and equips herself well, given the material she has to play with. However (after ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"") she must be kicking herself for not picking the 'right' summer blockbusters for her CV.  The main culprit here is the plot, which again is mystifying given that the writing team includes David Koepp (""Jurassic Park""; ""Mission Impossible""); Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") and Jon Spaihts (""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"", ""Doctor Strange"").  A poor script can sometimes be salvaged by a good director, but here we have Alex Kurtzman, who has only one other directing credit to his name. And I'm afraid it shows. All round, not a good day at the office.Brian Tyler did the music (aside from the Danny Elfman opening ""Dark Universe"" fanfare) but it comprises what I would term ""running and jumping music"", with few discernible leitmotifs for the characters breaking through.""Was that supposed to be funny?""

They seemed to try to keep CGI out as much as they could, which was very refreshing at 1hr 40mins i gave it 8 /10 I am really looking forward to Russell crowes and johnny Depp's films next on the list enjoy the movie and my review",The Mummy
138,brankovranjkovic,The Mummy – Yet another Reboot,6,29 June 2017,"This is a horror action thriller and launches another franchise (Dark Universe series) Starring Tom Cruise, playing himself (again). He accidentally uncovers the Mummy's tomb and awakens an ancient evil that wants to bring an end to the world! Unfortunately Tom Cruise was probably miss-cast as the lovable rouge who steals ancient artifacts. Cruise is just too old for the character he played, who ultimately has a conscience and who wants to do the right thing in the end. The film starts in the past and brings you up to the present day, there's some humour and great special effects, but in conclusion this is just a mash up between Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible with Zombies thrown in.",The Mummy

140,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,6 August 2017,"The Mummy is the first movie from the brand new cinematic Dark Universe, where monsters and gods come to life to give us films like Dracula, Invisible Man, Phantom of the Opera, Bride of Frankenstein and much, much more. So, is The Mummy the awesome start to the franchise Universal wanted? ... Nop. Not really.This movie is filled with flaws after flaws. Characters, script, tone ... Annabelle Wallis' character is the most cliché, under- developed, damsel in distress that I've seen in a while. After an amazing Wonder Woman movie that empowered women and female characters, here comes Jenny, a useless and brainless girl that keeps being a plot device for the main characters.Similar to DC Comics at the beginning of their universe, Universal wants to build its own all of a sudden without first actually considering making a good, ""standalone"" movie. There are huge exposition scenes throughout the whole runtime, but there's one at the very start that just made me think ""oh god ... no, please stop!"". Lazy writing and lack of creativity.Even if this is a monster movie, the plot surpasses the plausible and it's very convoluted. The ending is straight up stupid (I'm sorry, but it's the best word to describe it) and the tone between comedy (there's a lot and it doesn't always land) and action is sometimes off.In the middle of this mess, there are a few good things that elevate the film to a less negative rating ... Sofia Boutella really nails it as Ahmanet and Tom Cruise gives everything he has in the action sequences, as always. Russell Crowe is also in this movie and he's definitely a bright spot, especially during the one-on-one dialogues with Cruise. The action, even if it isn't as fun and entertaining as I expected, it still is a boost to the overall story. In addition to that, there's a lot of comedy, most of it is fine and there are a few ones that actually made me laugh out loud.All in all, The Mummy doesn't live to the hype and it crumbles as the first film in the Dark Universe franchise. A messy plot, a lot of exposition scenes, a damsel in distress, a child-written ending and an unbalanced tone between comedy and action brings the whole movie down. Sofia Boutella is the big savior, Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe are two bright spots and the comedy is actually funny. However, it's not enough to save this big disappointment.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Mummy

144,Alexander_Blanchett,Fatal Attraction with Mummies.,6,29 October 2017,"It was not that bad. Not great either mostly because of the really weak screenplay. The film sets up the new ""dark universe"" by Universal Pictures and that set up deserved a more promising film. The reason it failed was mostly the uninteresting characters it offers. You never feel a connection to them as they were so shallow without any depth or interesting background. Also the threat just concentrates on a small circle of people and not on a whole scale. Its like the mummy stalks Tom Cruise, and thats about it. Cruise himself was really miscast. It felt like Ethan Hunt fighting off supernatural elements. The role first of all needed to be written funnier and it needed an actor who doesn't take the film or himself too seriously. Cruise tried that but failed. Annabelle Wallis was okay but her character was so uninteresting and it really didn't make a difference for the film if it existed or not. I liked Russell Crowe's Dr. Jeckyll /Mr Hyde attempt and really would like to see a film focusing on that. But even that was ridiculed by director Alex Kurtzman. Sofia Boutella was fine enough in the titular role. Jake Johnson tried too hard to be to comedic sidekick. Anyway, the positive thing about the film is the truly great visuality. Also some of the actions scenes, especially at the beginning were really great executed. Too bad it starts to fail once the Mummy appears. I hope the future films of the dark universe are better and more inspired than this typical Hollywood horror adventure.",The Mummy
145,CANpatbuck3664,The Mummy Has Starpower and a Big Budget but Lacks the Mandatory Thrills/Scares or Any Sense of Fun,5,11 June 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) provides narration while we see some knights of crusade return to London back in the year 1127 AD. Some crews discover the burial site of these knights in present day and among the ruins are hieroglyphics on a mural. Dr. Jekyll is at the site and describes the story the mural tells. The tale is of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) who was destined to become the next ruler of Egypt. Her father then had a son with his second wife and he became the heir to the throne. Instead of taking that lying down, Ahmanet make a deal with the God of Death Set, where she sells her soul and she murders her father, his wife and their infant son. To complete the ritual, she has to kill her lover with a special dagger and when that's about to happen, she's knocked out and her lover is killed. She is mummified alive as punishment for her crimes and she's placed in a tomb far away from Egypt with special protective measures to make sure her spirit cannot escape.This stays safe till present day when two members of the U.S. Army on long range reconnaissance happen upon it. Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) are supposed to be army personnel but they're really looters and they try to sneak into a village full of insurgents to raid it. This goes bust and Chris has to call in an air strike on the position. This works but it accidentally unearths the tomb. Archaeologist Jenny Hasley (Annabelle Wallis) shows up on site and the 3 of them investigate the tomb. Ahmanet's sarcophagus is discovered and despite some security measures, they take it out of the tomb to be transported back to London to be properly investigated.So this is the first big movie in the Universal Dark Universe, which is Universal's attempt to have a big shared universe of franchises (like Marvel or DC with classic literary characters instead). This movie has a big responsibility to set that up and there's a lot riding on it. I want to talk about what I liked first. The best parts of this movie are in those moments where they're trying to branch out to some of the other properties the studio is going to introduce. The Prodigium headquarters has a lot of cool stuff in it and Dr. Henry Jekyll is a great character to bring us into that world. It's hard not to be excited with what the movie teases you with (if you know any of these characters). The movie does have some cool action bits (the plane crash is the best set piece but it's all spoiled in the trailer) and some of the special effects are interesting. I didn't find it to be a particularly strong 3D experience but there were a couple of times where they used it effectively.Getting to some of the more mixed aspects, one of the smart things that Universal did was bring in some big name actors to populate this movie. Tom Cruise is well cast and he remains watchable but he's let down by his character. I also thought Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll was a great choice, there's a moment that he gets to show his characters' other side and it was easily my favourite part in the whole The Mummy movie. Sofia Boutella did an admirable job with what she was given. The rest of the cast are more or less hung out to dry like the morning's laundry. Jake Johnson is so great when he's used effectively but he's relegated to being a shrill and annoying side kick. Annabelle Wallis is beautiful but she's extremely wooden in this. Her romance with Cruise falls completely flat and it's one of the reasons the ending fails. The rest of the cast gets extremely little to do and aren't noteworthy.Most of The Mummy's problems are at the script level. Our heroes lack any kind of proficiency or they give us very little reason to care about them. Morton lacks any relevant specialty (he doesn't even know what hieroglyphics and sarcophagus mean yet he recovers artifacts to sell on the black market) and he falls in love with Jenny way too quickly. Chris does nothing but complain and moan at Morton. Jenny isn't a shining example of her profession (the sarcophagus gets dragged through the dirt and hangs loosely from a helicopter with very little complaint from her). Despite a decent back story for Ahmanet, she gets little to do to show off her power except drain her victims and blow massive amounts of sand around. The movie isn't scary and the action moments lack next to Cruise's other franchises. Add in that the ending has a weird/lacklustre conclusion and they use the same scene transition over and over again (sparks flying) and you get a mess of a movie.The Stephen Sommers The Mummy movies weren't critical darlings but they were fun and they were entertaining, even if they weren't to be taken seriously. This movie should have took a few more cues from the previous entries in the franchise. This movie has some things to enjoy but it's way too serious overall and despite the fact they have heavy-hitters both in front of and behind the camera, it feels creatively substandard. I do think the Dark Universe is worth pursuing and I wouldn't mind seeing another Mummy movie with Cruise in it. But they needed to have a strong opening to kick this off and The Mummy falls flat.",The Mummy
146,Antagonisten,Not very entertaining,4,6 August 2017,"The title itself, The Mummy, promises a summer blockbuster. This, however, is not at all the same kind of vehicle as the films with Brendan Fraser. Gone is the element of comedy, replaced with a story that takes itself far too seriously.There is undoubtedly some talent in the making of this movie. Visually it's good, effects are good and action scenes are decent. But the flaws are still the most obvious thing about this movie. Tom Cruise is almost always wooden and mostly playing the same character again and again. Here though, he is a lot worse than usual. It feels like he is on complete autopilot throughout, barely even trying to make an effort.The real weight pulling this movie down though is the story. I don't know whether it's the victim of an editing disaster, or whether it was written this way. But the movie is a jumbled mess and has serious pacing problems. One would think that a movie with so much violence and special effects should at least be safe from boring you, but I still looked at my watch quite a few times during this movie.In the end I have to say I prefer the movies with Brendan Fraser, and the lighter take on The Mummy. A movie not taking itself too seriously can often be forgiven for it's shortcomings. This movie has no such excuses.",The Mummy
147,apryla-58795,Should have let this one stay mummified,3,18 December 2018,"I think a certain someone must be using their own money to buy box office tickets for their movies to seem successful. This was a real mess. After reading a little more of the IMDb notes it seems this is just the start of more movies to come from this franchise. Great! Can't wait...um yes I can.I'm so over a certain someone in this movie. I was never into them. They believe their own hype. I can't stand watching their movies cause all I can think about is what a narcissist they are.Annabelle Wallis is forgettable. It could have been anyone in her role.Russell Crowe is Ewww! I can't believe I ever found him sexy. L.A. Confidential was where he peaked. There's no excuse for any actor to be in his shape. With all the money, connections and perks movie stars have there is no excuse to not be in the best shape all the time. I can't believe he's younger than T. C. He looks at least 15 years older!This is a lame film that doesn't know what it wants to be. It's all over the place. The only good thing about this was Jake Johnson. He is pretty good in everything he's done. Even though he wasn't his usual best in this he's the only reason I rated this higher than a 1.Skip this. It's weak and forgettable.PS If anyone is wondering why I didn't use certain names in this...it's because IMDb declined my review several times (until I didn't name the main movie star in this film when critiquing them) when they never have before and I've done about 100 reviews. I've heard rumors about a certain movie star running everything behind the scenes to control their press. I didn't really believe it until now. There is some type of conspiracy going on here and I'm not one to believe in conspiracies but there you have it. Someone doesn't want any negative press so they pry have a deal worked out with IMDb so they can read the reviews before they are posted. Why else would my review get declined until I wiped it of certain names and negative comments regarding said certain movie star?",The Mummy

Nope. Is it any less scary than ""Alien: Convenant""? Nope. But that's where I despise the critics. This is no worse than a movie they slathered forgiveness an above average movie like that newest ""Alien"" yet a similar mess, though entertaining, is given instant death. Why? They are similar in the characters doing dumb things for profit.Why do people have a problem with Cruise being Cruise in a mummy movie? My only issue...he should never do theater lines. Lines similarly heard in ""Interview With a Vampire."" All in all, was it an enjoyable movie: yes, it's decent. Is it going to thrill you? The first half will, the second half will confuse you.

150,trinaboice,Tom Cruise is one dedicated actor,7,9 June 2017,"Grade: B-Rating: PG-13, 120 minutesIn a Nutshell: Universal Studio's Dark Universe presents a sexy, new mummy that hopes to kick-start a new universe of monster movies. It drops a lot of hints of what's to come.Critics are picking this origin movie apart, but it's fine for a summer popcorn flick that'll entertain you plenty in air conditioning. Uplifting theme: ""Death is the doorway to new life. We live today. We shall live again. In many forms shall we return."" Egyptian prayer of resurrection ""The past cannot remain buried forever."" – Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) ""Where's your sense of adventure?"" – Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) Good vs. evil. Things I liked: Tom Cruise is incredibly dedicated and hard-working in this film. He takes a serious beating in almost every scene and just keeps going and going like the Energizer Bunny. He said in an interview with Regal movie theater about the film, ""The sets are magnificent. They're beautiful. They're haunting"" and then later, ""It's a helluva lot of fun."" Sophia Boutella is really great as a seductive female mummy. We'll see her again soon in Atomic Blonde: The Coldest City. Russell Crowe's character was a surprise to me, but a pleasant one. We're sure to see more of him in this role. No spoiler! I want you to be surprised too! It's better in 3D. I liked the little details, such as Ahmanet's blue, cracked fingernails. Some of the set pieces are pretty cool and the special effects are impressive. Lots of fun jumps and scares. I liked Annabelle Wallis a lot. Unfortunately, she played a damsel in distress in almost every scene, but she was still pretty to watch.There is a welcome sense of humor.Things I didn't like: There are a lot of exposition scenes. They're necessary, although a bit annoying. Jake Johnson was a mildly entertaining sidekick, although sometimes an odd addition. Tom Cruise was funnier than the designated comic relief. · The film feels like action sequence, explanation scene, action sequence, explanation scene, etc. No end-of-credits scenes. Drats. Camel spiders. EEEEK! Tom Cruise plays a protagonist who isn't really a stellar hero. He's a flawed man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time . His set of moral standards is questionable. For example, Jenny yells, ""You stole from me!"" and his justification that he is still a good person is, ""But I didn't lie!""Did you ever see the first trailer? Tom Cruise lets out this extremely unpleasant, high-pitched scream that seems to have been replaced in the film, thank goodness. Funny lines: ""We are not looters. We are liberators of precious antiquities."" – Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) ""I'm sorry. We're just never going to happen. It's not me. It's you."" – Nick Morton ""Wow! That was intense."" – Chris Vail (Jake Johnson)Interesting lines: This is not a tomb. It's a prison."" – Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) ""There are worse fates than death."" – Ahmanet ""Evil never rests."" – Dr. Henry Jekyll ""Sometimes it does take a monster to fight a monster."" –Dr. Henry JekyllTips for parents: This probably should have been a Rated R movie. There is a lot of sexual innuendo, but more than that. There are some kinky moments and bare naked moments of Tom Cruise (covering his middle parts), and a naked side shot of Sophia Boutella. There are a ton of bloody, gory, fighting, destructive scenes. There is talk of an affair. Some profanity. Lots of dead bodies, scary mummies, and high body count.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",The Mummy
151,bheadher,The problem with this is two fold...,3,17 February 2018,"First off, they tried to make this version as an action vehicle for Tom Cruise...bad move, as it doesn't hold you with the mystery of a mummy movie...it is only a showcase fior Cruise, and nothing else...The other problem is Cruise himself. Tom has no depth to his acting, and never did. He cannot play a character in any other way but deadpan, with no real expression at all...frankly, Cruise tried to come off as an Indiana Jones, and failed miserably...As a side note, they presented a woman as the mummy, which didn't really boost the movie in any way...",The Mummy
152,davidgee,Not worth digging up,5,25 June 2017,"Mummy movies date from 1932 when Boris Karloff was first bandaged up. Hammer exhumed several mummies, starting with Christopher Lee in 1959. Then in 1999 Stephen Sommers launched a spectacular new series with Brendan Fraser busily trying to send Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back to hell. The Imhotep movies were strong on CGI, as pacy as an Indiana Jones adventure and full of humour. This new version has plenty of CGI, an uneven pace and heavy-handed humour that mostly falls flat. Sofia Boutella may be sexier than Arnold Vosloo, but his Imhotep had a lot more charisma than her Ahmanet.The desperate writers have also transcribed Dr Jekyll from Victorian London to a 21st-century laboratory, but he doesn't add anything to the mix other than make Russell Crowe look uncomfortable at lowering his standards. Tom Cruise seldom chooses a dud role, but here he has: his Ethan Hunt action man doesn't really work as Indiana Jones. The Mummy comes to life but the movie does not.",The Mummy
153,PyroSikTh,Not that Bad. Entertaining and Creepy,6,13 June 2017,"To say The Mummy is a reboot of the much-loved Brendan Fraiser movie eighteen years ago isn't quite accurate. It's a new set of characters, with a new, re-imagined Mummy, in a new setting and a new time, serving a new purpose. That's not to say it's without it's established roots. Much like the 1999 movie and the 1932 movie before that, a group of archaeologists and treasure hunters uncover a long-lost tomb containing the mummified remains of an evil Egyptian granted dark powers. Once risen, the Mummy sucks the life from it's victims to restore their flesh, and sprawls the world looking to finish what they started millennia ago. Fairly standard Mummy affair, it's a tried-and-true story and it still works in today's version.One of the key differences of this new film though, is it's attempt to kickstart a cinematic universe, and so we get new elements and characters added in to spice up the mythology. We get a prologue of a secret tomb of crusaders beneath London who safeguard a deep secret, we get a mysterious organisation headed by Dr. Jekyll seeking to collect and study all manner of monstrous entities, and our Mummy is a princess seduced by the Egyptian god Set to murder her family in the quest for power, but is ultimately just a puppet herself.Now this isn't a story complemented with writing that'll win any accolades, but it managed to weave the classic story into something fresh and interesting, and even if it doesn't always stick the landing, you have to commend their effort to try and achieve something new. Despite my reservations on the idea of a unifying universe of classic monsters, what The Mummy has to offer certainly has me looking forward to the next movie; Bride of Frankenstein, narratively speaking. It suggests that they have planned out some kind of sprawling epic (rather than winging it one movie at a time), and that has me intrigued to see where they take it.On the action front, it wasn't as bad as I'd hoped either. While the silly scenes in the trailers are ever present (like Tom Cruise just happening to be in the right place to go through a bus window unharmed, or somehow managing to get thrown out of an Ambulance and not getting crushed by it as it tumbles down the hill), they each enjoyed added context to make them a little easier to stomach. They're small sections of larger sequences that, while not the most intense action sequences created, do offer moments of genuine entertainment. You cannot fault The Mummy on it's pacing at all, as it's slow moments never last long enough for you to get bored, and the more action-packed moments don't drag on long enough that they feel overdone.Something else that surprised me was how creepy this movie was. I'd seen a lot of comments from people saying they wish it was a more straight-up horror movie; that it wasn't scary at all, but this isn't called the Dark Universe for nothing. While The Mummy certainly enjoys it's moments of levity and silliness, it's certainly a serious affair that doesn't shy away from the darker, scarier subject matter. Ahmanet's pact with Set is fairly unsettling to watch, as is her re-emergence from her sarcophagus and the army of skeletal warriors she assembles as the movie goes on. There's something creepy and unsettling in their presentation and their movements. Okay, so the continuous, predictable jump scares got a little tiring after a while, but often they did their job of getting me on the edge of my seat fearing whatever might jump out at me.CGI-wise, again the final movie benefited from having time between trailer and release to finish off key sequences. It's not the best, most-breathtaking CGI you'll ever see, but it was good enough to get the point across. A scene of shattering glass in the trailer looked god-awful, but in the final film the edges were smoothed out and the glass turning to sand looked about right. If I had any criticism on the CGI front, it would be the mercury effects used to encase Ahmanet. It didn't look real and that took me out of the experience a little bit. Then again my knowledge of chemistry isn't the greatest, and looking at videos of real liquid mercury, it looks almost identical to what featured in the movie so I guess no complaints on that front either.Was The Mummy a great movie? No. It won't feature on anyone's top movies of the year lists. In fact if it wasn't for the connection to a promised Dark Universe, I doubt anyone will even remember it in a few years. It has some creepy scenes, and injects some interesting concepts into a classic story really well, but beyond that it's a fairly mediocre affair; not bad enough to warrant the awful reviews it's been getting, but also not good enough to be surprised by them. For what it's worth, I enjoyed The Mummy, and I'm sure many people will. It's not a complete trainwreck, and I look forward to where it leads the Dark Universe. I give The Mummy an above-average 6/10",The Mummy

155,MovieHoliks,Wait for the DVD...LOL,5,19 June 2017,"When I first heard they were rebooting ""The Mummy"" franchise with Tom Cruise starring, I thought it kinda odd since this movie/series doesn't really seem to mesh with the typical Cruise vehicle. Since then it's been revealed that Universal is doing a ""Dark Universe"" series of films, similar to the Marvel and DC Universe films -- all being tied together, and the next one in the series is apparently ""Bride of Frankenstein"".As for this movie, I got around to seeing it over the weekend, the 2nd week of it's release, and there is really a lot about this movie I like. It is really just a Tom Cruise/""Mission: Impossible"" -type movie, set in the disguise of a ""Mummy"" movie... LOL But I did like a lot of the sets, story arcs, locales, etc.. This movie tries to be both a horror movie and, strangely enough, an action-comedy at times, and I found that amusing. Jake Johnson (""The New Girl"") plays to good, while rather creepy (LOL) comic relief timing as Cruise's sidekick in this, and I think I chuckled every time he popped up on screen. Plus, some nice eye candy, with both actresses playing both the lead heroine, and the ""Mummy"" character herself. I also found it sorta odd seeing a bloated Russell Crowe show up as Dr. Jekyl, and TBH I liked the ""Mr. Hyde"" character much more in the 2003 film, ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" -- much neater interpretation of the character IMHO. And one scene in particular I found to be the scariest scene in the film -- when the cargo plane featured loses control and goes into ""free fall"". This scene is not for the faint of heart, and I found out after the fact, it was shot using that infamous ""vomit comet"" technique employed to create weightlessness in such past films as ""Apollo 13"". I'm on the fence on this movie -- while it had the biggest worldwide opening for any Cruise film to date, I would gladly recommend waiting for the DVD LOL",The Mummy

157,blackmamba99971,I could not stomach this film,1,10 June 2017,"Basically this is a romp for which there is no return. The Mummy of 2017 should have been called just 'Set' since this movie is about him in the first place. Tom Cruise should not have been playing a soldier of fortune or in this case a grave robber because one it does not suit his character or personality. For years he has played a secret agent or random killer to let the audience know of his calibre, which is to say a damn good actor. This mess just helped him take a nose dive. If perhaps he did play a well trained soldier doing his job and then get thrust into the world of darkness and evil it would be more believable. There was nothing funny about it. Second, Sophia Boutella is not my cup of tea. As pretty as she is her acting in this film did not do her credit. She was supposed to be mummified alive then imprisoned in some mercury pool for all of eternity but why transfer her to Iran to do so? The story could have used a better explanation as to that reason. Amahnet was supposed to be the antagonist through out the story but it turns out that it was Set who was to be the lead. I could not handle watching her antics, or innuendos that said evil. She simply did not have that dark side which all those who seek power should have.What was also sad was that Tom looked like he was a in complete daze through out the entire film. Either he was on something or the writing was just that bad. The only person I thought was doing a great job was Annabelle Wallis who played Jenny. Working as both an archaeologist, and evil banish-er who works under her boss Doctor Jekyll (Russell Crowe). Now here is where it gets worse. Can anyone say League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? I was surprised that none of the other fictional characters didn't pop out somewhere. It was the last straw that broke the camel's back when his role was introduced. Put this mess together and you have one hell of a bad story plot that did not work the first time with Sean Connery who by the way retired after doing the league film. He once said; ""It has become a world full of dollar signs, and fast paced directors who think they are the next Oscar winner. Acting has become nothing more than a crutch for house bills rather than directing as a passion."" When you hear someone such as Sean explain how it is in Hollywood you can then assume that it is all over. Studios doing the found footage crap mixing it with action or humour has become an insult to the guilds. Stodgy or jerky cam movements are nothing more than a lazy man's way out of setting up a good shot properly. There have been many examples of jerky cam or as I like to call it an epileptic seizure while filming such as The hurt locker, Blair witch, Cloverfield, existential films, as well as other horror movies or just films with next to no budget. Students who learn film making these days often take the back road when it comes to creating a work of art. For people like Peter Jackson or the Waichowski brothers adding extremely slight bits of jerky cam works a hell of a lot better than using it through out the filming process. I even heard how past audience members got sick because of how the picture shakes or shimmy's side to side or up and down to make the films I mentioned believable. Lastly, Tom should have thought long and hard about taking this role. Now he doesn't need money for one. He has enough to retire for four life times, and seeing as his choosing this role is now in question will he become another John Travolta who will pick just about anything these days? There was too much CGI through out such as the plane falling but I did like the anti-gravity scene which was very well done. Now I like the Mummy series but this inception should not have been given the title. I would have accepted it as 'Set'. The name sounds intimidating, while it represents evil incarnate. Telling the story about Set as a past tense film working its way up to our present would have worked, and the audience would have accepted such a theme with open arms.My final thoughts about The Mummy is this, never fix something when it isn't broken. Never use fictional characters such as Doctor Jekyll to boost the story's punch line, and never use a female lead antagonist because the audience cannot accept such a concept even with a highly geared disposition to women's liberalism. She was not scary enough, nor was Amanhet completely devoted to Set. Annabelle Wallis was the better pick because she had purpose, drive, and a sense of pure will to get the job done. Everyone else was just a standby in my view. Not recommended simply because this is the first film I ever criticized at being just -- A bad movie.",The Mummy
158,stevenrotherforth,The Dark Universe could already be dead and buried,4,7 March 2018,"The Mummy So this movie has been getting some pretty bad reviews.
There's a reason for this and It's because it is indeed pretty bad.
A complete wasted opportunity that seems to only exist to set up an entire dark universe of more pretty bad movies.
Everyone knows the premise behind The Mummy and this time around to try and do something fresh we get a female Mummy played by Sofia Boutella.
Unfortunately this movie is about as fresh as a Mummy's butt crack!
 All is not completely lost as we do get yet another committed performance from Tom Cruise, but not even he can save this rotten corpse of a movie.
The problem lays with the screenplay. Too many chefs spoiling the broth or writers in this instance.
The whole movie is a mishmash of ideas that results in one action scene leading to another other with no real story direction to gel the whole thing together.
In between the action scenes we get the odd exposition that do nothing to make this flick anymore comprehendible.
So back to the action scenes we go. 
Apart from the exciting and memorable plane crash scene what follows soon becomes a repetitive and tedious mess.
Russell Crowes performance is mildly embarrassing. That accent! Talk about cringe worthy.
Annabelle Wallis's character spends most of the movie being saved by Tom Cruise as she adds nothing to an already bland affair.
Come on guys it's 2018. Do we still need to have a damsel in distress. Surely movies have evolved on from this?
 Sadly not this one. It's as stale as the inside of a Mummy's coffin ( sorry sarcophagus) A little movie in joke there.
This brings me on to the humour.
Tom Cruise does have some funny lines which help keep the movie from failing to engage its audience completely.
 However the use of a side kick played by Jake Johnson proves once again that the screenwriters are still living in ancient times.
Johnson's character soon becomes annoying and just when you think he's dead he comes back as a wisecracking Zombie.
Like I said it's a mishmash of ideas.
This movie fails to know what it's trying to be.
Anyway I'll wrap this one up as should Universal. I think their Dark Universe could already be dead and buried.",The Mummy
159,p-jonsson,Not as bad as a lot of people claim,6,27 October 2017,"In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much. Being a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror fan I had to watch it regardless of what people said about it of course. I have to say that I do not understand why so many seem to claim it is utter crap. Sure, it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either. It is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good. That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after all.To me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise. Total lack of charisma. He really do not succeed in his role. He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown into.Russell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll. I quite like Doctor Jekyll being thrown into the mix by the way. I think his role worked quite well and was well played.Being a mummy movie there are of course a lot of supernatural stuff, curses, monsters and action. In general I think it was reasonably well done. The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, was not bad at all.On the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress. There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work. I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for him.Bottom line, I did enjoy the movie. As I wrote it is not really bad but it could have been quite a bit better. The good parts were sometimes really good but in between it felt like everyone went to lunch and let the janitors have a go at movie making.",The Mummy
160,Finfrosk86,Did I watch the same movie? I thought that was awesome.,8,12 August 2017,"What, in the name of all that is sweet and pure, is the matter with people? Man this movie has been roughed up by critics and audience a like. When you hear the same thing from everyone, after a while you start thinking it has to be true. But no.The Mummy is entertaining, fun, has some really cool effects, it's kind of creative, well paced, good action, and I thought it was just pretty awesome. Of course I was expecting it not to be good, so maybe that has something to do with it, I won't know until the next time I see it.I think this movie is just too fantastical for a lot of people. People are really narrow minded, you know. When it comes to movies, people are narrow minded in a really weird, and annoying way. The react like crazy about some things, but a lot of things they never even bat an eye at. I can't go into specifics about it, because spoilers, but I think I'm right in this case. It's just about too fantastical for people. Also Tom Cruise might be a reason. Yeah he's batsh*te crazy, but who cares, he's in a lot of good movies, and that's what matters.Let me get back to the effects, because they are really well done. Especially some of the more scary imagery is really really cool. I think it's done with CGI, but it looks very good, very real. Pretty scary actually. It's also cool that Tom Cruise does most of his own stunts. Yes, the movie is pretty Tom Cruise heavy, but I liked him here. There were also a couple of, slightly unexpected twists and turns that I liked, in the story. I look forward to the next movie in this universe.I think everyone is wrong about this one. I really liked it. It entertained me. Nice mix of adventure, action and horror.",The Mummy
161,EthanBJones_03,It took 6 writers to make something a child could have wrote in 6 minutes.,4,13 June 2017,"'THE MUMMY' was Alex Kurtzman's directorial debut, and stars Tom Cruise, Sophia Boutella and Annabelle Wallis. ​After unearthing an ancient Prison, Nick Morton(Tom Cruise) is chosen by an ancient, mummified princess(Sofia Boutella) to be the body of the God of Death. With the help of Jenny(Annabelle Wallis) and Henry(Russel Crowe), he must find a way to stop the curse before he becomes the God of Death.I'm sad to say that the 'Dark Universe' is not of to a good start. That is sad to say because I really like some of the ideas and characters in this movie. Tom Cruise tries his best to make it float and keeps the hamster wheel spinning. Russel Crowe is awesome as his character(who I will not spoil for you!). There are a lot of interesting concepts in this movie that I will be very interested to see expand in future installments. Despite all of this, it's a messy, incoherent mess that has very little other than Cruise and Crowe keeping it alive.The plot of this movie is very clustered and very little thought went into it. They shoehorn a LOT of exposition in to the movie. I will honestly argue that 10% of this movie's script was exposition. That doesn't sound bad but that is still 12 whole minutes of screen time wasted. I get setting stuff up but when the first scene in the film is setting stuff up, you know you've messed up. They also try to set up their 'Dark Universe' which would have been fine if they didn't focus so much on it. This should have been called 'Dark Universe' and in tiny print 'featuring the mummy' because that is what it is; a feature length commercial for this new universe and that is not okay. The film comes first; not the world.Now that my gripes surrounding the 'plot' are out of the way, lets concentrate on the cast. As stated before, both Cruise and Crowe do great jobs and carry the movie. Sadly, they are not the only two characters. Sophia Boutella was very weak as 'The Mummy' and was about as bland and generic as villains come. Her motivation was nonsensical, she lacked any real threatening qualities and she was a side character in HER OWN MOVIE. Annabelle Wallis was also really weak as Jenny and, to paraphrase the late great Roger Ebert 'I don't believe her and Cruise were even on the same set, they had that little chemistry'. Again, not his exact words but I'm borrowing the phrase nonetheless.The cinematography for this movie is meh at best. It was well shot, I will say that, but the editing and lighting and everything else was so poorly done. The effects were sub-par and didn't look in the least bit realistic. The costume design was pretty lazy and generic but the set design was very inventive and cool.Some of the action in this movie was fine. Some of the comedy worked. Some of the horror worked. That is actually the best way to describe this movie. Some of everything worked but not enough to make the movie great. Alas, as much as I really wanted to like this movie, I can't say I recommend it and I'll rate it a pretty generous 4 ​scenes-of-overly-complicated-exposition-and-stupid-explaining... out of 10, purely for Cruise and Crowe alone.",The Mummy
162,Mike_Devine,This 'Mummy' should've remained buried,4,23 November 2018,"One of the biggest blockbusters to come out in the summer of 1999 was an Egypt-set action thriller starring Brendan Fraser. While the film was pretty campy and over-the-top, it worked well and resonated with audiences. Fast-forward 18 years and we have a film of the same title - 'The Mummy' - only starring Tom Cruise in the role of Nick Morton, a treasure hunting renegade who stumbles upon a 5,000-year curse.The only problem is, this film is far inferior to the original. Whether it's Cruise's schtick not jiving with the plot, or the lackluster CGI, or the wooden script, it's hard to say. There's really nothing thrilling about 'Mummy,' as everything feels borrowed, used or broken - nothing is shiny and new. Even fresh faces like Jake Johnson and Sofia Boutella aren't enough to up the excitement factor, and vets like Russell Crowe come off as looking to be in need of a paycheck rather than delivering a performance to be happy with. The action sequences are boring, the ""comic relief"" is far from funny and the acting itself is nothing to marvel at.Cruise can usually find a way to make his films at least somewhat entertaining, but he fails here. There is no chemistry between any of the characters, including Nick and his love interest, Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), so the onus is really on Cruise to shoulder everything. In this case, it's an insurmountable task.'The Mummy' is a half-hearted attempt to revive a franchise that started strong and has since faded, so it's likely it will be put back in a sarcophagus.",The Mummy
163,Ramascreen,Dark Universe off to a bad start,4,7 June 2017,"If #TheMummy is supposed to be the beginning of Universal's ambitious Dark Universe that showcases their classic monsters in one big shared cinematic crossover, then they're off to a terrible start.There's probably only a couple of sequences that somewhat thrill, the rest are just a continuous string of one poorly written, poorly acted and poorly executed scene after another. It feels more like sitting in a dentist's waiting room as opposed to rockin' on a roller coaster ride. And Tom Cruise is just wrong for this role, a huge case of miscast. Perhaps they should just press the reboot button again.Sofia Boutella plays an evil ancient princess imprisoned in a tomb deep beneath the unforgiving desert. When a couple of treasure hunters and an archaeologist awaken her in our present day, she returns to life to reclaim her destiny while at the same time unleashing unimaginable terrors in this new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters. Co-starring Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson, directed by Alex Kurtzman.The concept of what the writers and director Alex Kurtzman is trying to present to us with ""The Mummy"" is nothing new, in fact it's quite predictable, but the biggest problem about it is that along the way from point A to point B, they fill it in with moments that just don't work. And it gets even more frustrating when they bring it up again the second, third and fourth time as if shoving it down our throats would make it better. The jokes fall flat so much so you kinda feel sorry for Jake Johnson who clearly wants to make some effort as this film's comic relief. There are also parts that are just absolutely pointless and unnecessary. The characters including Dr. Jekyll frequently draw conclusions out of their butts. I do think ""The Mummy"" is what happens when the story is forced to serve the visual spectacle instead of the other way around. That said, rising star Sofia Boutella is a marvelous choice, she exudes that thirst for power effortlessly in addition to being incredibly seductive.But of course, just as expected, instead of it being a movie about Sofia Boutella's The Mummy, it becomes all about Tom Cruise, who as I said earlier is just awfully wrong for this role. I understand that the studios probably think that banking on a A-lister would translate into box office results, but fact of the matter is outside ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, Cruise just doesn't fit anywhere else anymore. The character that he plays here is is a thieving treasure hunter, much like Nathan Drake from ""Uncharted"" games, but all you see on the screen instead is special agent Ethan Hunt desperately trying to be someone he's not. By the end of ""The Mummy"" you're going to have second thoughts about anticipating the next installment of this Dark Universe, and you're going to want to wish Brendan Fraser had still been around.-- Rama's Screen --",The Mummy

165,DeBBss,It's not a bad movie,6,30 August 2017,"People are hating on The Mummy so much, I don't see the big deal, it's entertaining, and has a good story, but I think the big issue is the characters.Story: 7/10 Ahmanet was an Egyptian princess, and she was going to take her father's place when he dies, but he later got a son, and Ahmanet was not happy, so she made a curse with the death god, and she would have eternal life, she killed her family, but the guards caught her, and they mummified her alive, fast forward 3000 years where Nick, Jenny, and Chris find her tomb, and accidentally unleash her. The story is a bit confusing, but you still now whats going on.Characters: 6/10Nick Morton: Nick is a good character, but he is the cliché hero, there's nothing special about him.Dr. Henry Jekyll: Henry is a very mysterious character, he has this dark side which I think is the best part about him.Jenny Halsey: Jenny is Nick's girlfriend, but they have this weird off and on relationship, and it feels really forced.Ahmanet: Ahmanet is the mummy, at the beginning of the movie she was this creepy skinny freak show, but then at the end of the movie she was human like, I think she's better off with the creepy version.Chris Vail: Chris is the funny character, but he has no punch lines, and he's a complicated character.Action: 6/10The action is good, it kind of reminds me of a 90s action movie, and the CGI is believable, I think the action could be better if there was a full on fist fight between Nick and Ahmanet.This movie isn't as good as the original like the characters, but this movie isn't bad, I think people are influenced by the media.",The Mummy
166,DuskShadow,Revitalizing an Old Monster franchise mash up. But Wheres Abbot and Costello?,5,23 June 2017,"They Did The Mash! But it was a a piece of graveyard trash. Thats right folks, this film is basically another retconning of the horror classics that have been made again and again. Universal is crafting a monster movie themed world that is little more than The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Bleh.With all the comic adaptations constantly transitioning into movies, and the comics themselves shamelessly rewriting their own mythos and history nonstop, now Hollywood is tampering with the greats in mediocre ways.The new Mummy film failed to wow at all. The lack of showmanship( or womanship) for the titular villainess and her powers was such a letdown, that I would have been more enthralled by a second rate magic act on the gong show. There's only so much as can be done with less than 2 hours for a film these days. And usually wherever Russell Crowe and the aged action wannabe Tom Cruise pops up, a flop is made. Oh but throw in some crypts here and there to illustrate the atmosphere by jamming random locations down audiences throats is a cheap move where a movie about the occult is concerned. So much wasted potential. Just a bunch of dim lighting and bland shadowy figures shambling about.Crow throws his literal weight around , always needing at least one quick fight scene and terrible acting, and hes a few million richer. Same goes for Cruise: the hapless adventurer seems a role perfectly suited to Cruise. Hes so typecast that in action or even sci fi, there's no depth or gamut of flavor to the mans acting. He brings nothing anymore to a films plot. And this has been his one forte for far more than a decade now. I was unimpressed with this film, hoping for a continuation of the 90s Mummy with Brendon Frasier, which was gold, but alas the new Mummy was as cheesy as critics labled the Frasier version. Some shady lighting and a gaunt androgynous looking antagonist just doesn't cut it for the refined movie veteran. Perhaps it never really did, but now there's a perfect precedence. And the closure was as hollow as a mummies chest cavity: its got no heart. The ending was terrible and left nothing memorable for me to ponder or recall fondly.If you find this on netflix or something in a few months, and you don't care and wanna relax to nonsense with a beer or something, then by all means waste your time with this nonsense.",The Mummy

They both sit very uncomfortable and overdo it to the extreme. I would imagine the producers had a different idea until the Cruise ego went into overdrive and had to do what he said...and I have a sneaking suspicion that he had a hand in the directing.Would have benefited with unknowns and concentrating on the story.

It's an attempt to create a whole new cinematic world, or rather cinematic universe. Populated with super beings, over which none will claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already. It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.Cinematically it means tons of CGI, and every kind of monster the script writer could find in the archives of Universal St. and some from other cinematic archives too. It was a bit much when they tried it on 2004 with Van Helsing. And Hugh Jackman never repeated that mistake. So Tom Cruise is here to take his place. Truth is, we should've seen it coming. Tom Cruise must've wanted to be Superman all these years, but even he knew he wasn't physically suitable so he relented into an endless list of action heroes that were borderline super beings but not actually super. Thing is, he's not getting younger, and the idea of doing his own stunts is getting less and less practical, so Tom Cruise found the ultimate solution, he went in and made himself a god.Yes if you do want to watch it, you need to do more than just suspend your judgment.

It suffers (a) from the presence of Tom Cruise, which is unjustified, but that's simply how a lot of people see Cruise. And (b) it suffers from the expectation that it's a remake/reboot from The Mummy (1999), which it isn't.The good part is that the movie is slightly entertaining, different enough and offers just enough easter eggs to other genres to make you want to pay attention. The best part is an appearance by Russel Crowe as Jekyll & Hyde, and he steals every second.The bad part is that Tom Cruise is not engaging and neither is Sofia Boutella as the titular villain. The horrible part is Annabelle Wallis who is either a terrible actress, or she was just given a bad and generic script.Unfortunately this lead to the cancellation of a whole universe.

174,kaptenvideo-89875,Plenty of furious action and some massive setpieces to get people their money's worth,7,8 June 2017,"It's here: one of the summer's notable would-be blockbusters, Tom Cruise's tender but honest account of his tumultuous relationship with his mother. (Sorry, the joke's probably more effective in spoken form.) Actually, an ancient princess (Sofia Boutella) is awakened from her crypt, and it's up to Tom Cruise to release the world of her danger, with Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe, Jake Johnson and others helping. Cruise didn't get to become a box-office star by being coy. He prefers to do event movies: epic and offering something that others don't, be it visuals, physical tricks, or storywise. This is why you see him in leading role usually once a year – epics need time. (Except, actually, this year, with ""American Made"" following in August.) In The Mummy's"" case, it's both visuals and tricks that should draw the people in. The 110 minute movie has plenty of furious action and some massive setpieces to get people their money's worth. The only troubled note is that critics don't seem to heart it – 39/100 in Metacritic and only 25/100 in Rotten Tomatoes –, with Rolling Stone calling it monster fail"", for example. I'd like to be more generous because I think the result is actually pretty entertaining. Despite the efforts to make everything look as badass and epic as possible, it's still a fun B-movie adventure at heart. They don't aim for any direct comedy, but the leading character can be clueless enough, and the events unpredictable, to earn a few smiles and winks along the way. For example, the moment of swimming underwater with a few unexpected followers. Fearing to spoil something for someone, I will not go into details, but: I also really liked mummy's servants. How they come alive, how they move and look, how they are dealt with. True, there are obvious influences to some famous videogames, but they still look fresh and creepy. And by fresh, I mean not generic. Cruise's acting seemed surprisingly cheesy at times, but this is probably intentional, and what do you expect from a monster movie anyway, eh. And this pretty old guy – 53 when the filming started – can still kick ass! No reason to stop being action hero. Not that he's planning. If there's one big problem, then it's the tiresome final act which gets concerned not with properly leading the story to conclusion but creating a movie franchise for future. It goes on a bit too long and made me feel a bit exhausted. The Mummy"" is the first title in the so-called Dark Universe, or Universal's competitor to Disney/Marvel's and Warner/DC's ever- expanding world of comic-book- characters. Universal plans to bring many of its classical horrors back in cinemas, starting with Bride of Frankenstein"" and Creature from the Black Lagoon"" both coming in 2019. The Mummy"" is not probably the mightiest kick-off they could have hoped for, but I kinda like it.

There are some good twists in the movie, particularly around Russell Crowe's character of a mysterious Doctor. The ending offers a decent twist too. But in between, this woman who is supposedly an artifacts collector is somewhat annoying. Sofia Boutella as the mummified princess is sometimes hot, sometimes cold.The story has peaks and ebbs too. There's a fantastic scene in an airplane, but then other stupid chase scenes that look like they came right out of Night of the Zombies. Pretty ho-hum.The makeup and CGI effects were outstanding, especially around Boutella's face and body, and the flashbacks to when she was princess in waiting.But overall, I kept fast forwarding past boring parts and looked forward to some conclusion, which you don't quite get with the ending.Tom Cruise's character was particularly annoying. He had to play a soldier who was a thief who got in over his head. But he tried to mix in a humorous side that just fell flat IMHO. This guy should have been scared sh-tless out of his mind, but well, that was not delivered well by Cruise.Overall, an uneven, sometimes satisfying movie that mostly goes thru the motions.",The Mummy

177,trublu215,Among The Worst Summer Blockbusters I've Seen,3,8 June 2017,"The Mummy has had countless iterations of the character grace the screen for the better part of the 20th Century. With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.The story is absolute crap to put it as lightly as I can. It is plotted so on-the-nose that you can't have anything left up to your imagination except for some scenes of violence that may have been too much for a PG-13. Outside of that, everything is spoon fed to us as the audience. Instead of making you feel like you can keep up, the movie treats its audience like we are stupid and still expects us to continue watching. Honestly, I almost walked out at certain points, it got that bad. Especially during the scenes with Crowe's Jekyll, which are so heavily plot oriented that you can't get a feel for his character and when you get the chance to, it fails, crashes and burns.The cast is surprisingly strong on paper but director Alex Kurtzman fails to utilize them in roles that best suit them. Tom Cruise is really the only cast member that fits the part which, when considering what genre we're talking about here, is a horrible thing. Courtney B Vance, who delivered an awards caliber performance in American Crime Story, is watered down to nothing more than a mere walk on role. Russell Crowe is so obviously doing the film for the paycheck, it feels like he isn't even acting and he is just reading queue cards. As a fan of the cast and the 1932 original, I was left completely disappointed by everyone here. Director Alex Kurtzman, who went from directing a small indie to all of a sudden directing this big bombastic action summer blockbuster, feels out of his element here and misses the beats of a good action movie and completely neglects everything that could make a great horror film.

180,rehmankhilji,Horrible for Tom Cruise and Russel Crow level,3,1 September 2017,"Yes, it is overly awful. Why, cause when in the cast line you see the names ""Tom Cruise"" and ""Russell Crowe"", after watching its trailers for months, you make a hype in your mind how damn good this movie would be. The 1999 Mummy with Brendan Fraser was a complete different in that era. Its Part 2 was good too, but when they made that stupid 3rd Part by pulling out Rachel Weisz based on some Chinese mummy (which are never there i think) it was a complete disaster. And with this the did it again. Although few shots were inspired from the 1999 movie but over all the movie presentation was too confusing. For instance till now i fail to understand what the hell was Russell Crowe? Tom on the other hand was having a beat up face all the time. It was a complete disappointment with loads and loads and loads of goof's. Really disappointed.",The Mummy
181,songod-95003,Not as terrible as some say it is...,5,14 June 2017,"Having grown up with the Universal Studios now classic monsters on TV (and some I've had the pleasure of seeing on real movie screens) the mummy will always be Lon Chaney Jr shuffling through the streets of fictional Mapleton MA seeking out the members of the Banning family who defiled the tomb of his ancient love, Ananka (except in the final sequel when the tale for no reason given morphed into the swamps of Louisiana!)(I know, you thought I'd say Karloff in the 1932 original ""The Mummy"", huh? No because he spent about 3 minutes of the movie as an actual living dead mummy and the rest as a reanimated former mummy now passing for human.)Taken for what this is, a Tom Cruise movie, it is not a bad Tom Cruise movie. That, though, I believe was the major mis-step in this attempt to reboot Universal's catalog of monster movies. Cruise comes with certain expectations. Proved over time, whenever he steps outside of the ""box"" he is in as an action star, the films tend to be abandoned by his legion of fans. Had anyone else been cast as the lead, an unknown would have been best, the cinematic (and personal here in the USA) luggage Cruise brings would not have been an issue. Instead, from the get go, I groaned inwardly knowing this mummy would be ""Jack Reacher meets The Mummy"" and that said mummy would be an impossibly hot chick!But wasn't that the ideal? Wasn't that the desire of the board room committee that green lit this film? It would be too much to ask these days for a big Hollywood monster movie to not be full of explosions, impossible acts of magic, and globe trotting adventure. The creeping terror of a relentless 3000 year old shuffling dead man out to avenge his ancient religion just doesn't chill and thrill anymore. So this is what we get: ""Jack Reacher meets The Mummy"". Makes me deeply fear what Universal will do with the already announced ""Bride of Frankenstein"", ""The Invisible Man"", and ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"".I would truly love to see the classic monsters in the hands of an indie studio with a modest yet appropriate budget. Dial it back to when a living mummy was exactly that.(Note: For a truly terrific take on the classic monsters\characters watch all three seasons of Showtimes ""Penny Dreadful"". The Frankenstein Monster, the wolfman, Van Helsing, Dorian Gray, Dracula, and a host of other literary figures all mesh in a well written well shot, and superbly acted series. BUT - no explosions!)",The Mummy
182,FallenEye,"One Man, Two Yummy Mummies.",6,16 June 2017,"There are 3 main highlights The Mummy has, as far as I can see, two of which aren't necessarily enough to make a movie good, but, more than enough to make a movie worth watching perhaps.1. Sofia Boutella's deadly sex-appeal. Her performance was good, however, I found vouching for her not really based on the story, but more based on how appealing she is.2. Annabelle Wallis's slow hitting attractiveness. When the movie starts, it's clear to see she is pretty, but, by the end, she's pretty hot.3. The humor. Cruise was stylish with it, and delivered it so well. Though the humor was somewhat things we've seen before, The Mummy really did have moments of humor I don't think I've experienced before, like with Ant-Man. Nick attempting to leave Jenny behind and Nick driving all the way back to Princess Ahmanet, were straight up, funny as all, hell.From there, the execution, was standard to above par. The story, has moments where it perhaps doesn't make as much sense as one would prefer perhaps, especially Nick doing to himself what he did. The composition I feel, wasn't Tyler's best, but still good. The effects, nothing we haven't seen before really and the performances all around, good.As a beginning to a universe, I couldn't help but compare them to Marvel, for 2 reasons; Tom Cruise was actually meant to be the guy to kick start Marvel as Iron Man, and, Marvel are the originators of building such a world. In comparison, The Mummy is bland. In isolation, it could've been better.The Mummy just feels like another movie, another blockbuster. However, it's not bad, and I am looking forward to seeing it's universe unfold, albeit at a snails pace. 6.4/10.",The Mummy
183,austin0731,A sloppy beginning for The Dark Universe,4,12 June 2017,"The Mummy is the first installment of Universal's new 'Dark Universe' the latest addition to the trend of cinematic universes; So how does it fare? The first of many is well, simply fine. It is better than the 'attempts' of launching the Dark Universe such as 'I, Frankenstein' and 'Dracula Untold' but there is much room for improvement. Personally I think that Tom Cruise was really good, he is a true box office draw/action movie star. He was also very funny in this film and plays outside of what he usually does, he wasn't a complete protagonist so that made him slightly more refreshing than Cruises' usual work. Also I think I quite liked the comedic relief in the form of Jake Johnson from New Girl, although I could seeing it veering towards annoyance as the film progresses. Also, although Sofia Boutella as the female mummy to me was quite a highlight of the film there simply wasn't much of her which was a disappointment because of how good she was. Russell Crowe as Doctor Jekyll once again, a great actor doing very well. The thing is, even though the Mummy had great acting, special effects and all it flops quite largely at the script. Nothing really happens and the narrative flow is rather off putting, there are jumps from scene to scene and seemed like a jumbled mess. I would say that it is a decent attempt in setting up the universe by introducing Doctor Jekyll and all and I do want to remind you all of Marvel's early days of not so great films, I mean look at them now. So I suppose I am looking forward to more 'Dark Universe'.",The Mummy
184,rlaine,This movie lacks heart,3,22 May 2018,"I had a hard time watching this movie, but I wanted to finish it anyway. From the beginning I was put off with the looting, disastrous, cliched soldiers, who are actually the leads here. I mean with their intentions, they should be the bad guys who Indy is trying to stop.15 minutes to the film and I was so fed up with the constant witty remark, explosion, witty remark, attempted joke, explosion, witty remark, running, bombs, everything explodes, attempted joke and witty remark etc etc. Super annoying. Cruise plays one of the most obnoxious characters I've seen in a while.Then they introduce Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) and more witty remarks. Jenny seems to suffer a bit from the Indy 3 Elsa syndrome as she clearly doesn't look like a library type archeologist, but more like a tough business woman (sorry bout the stereotypes), so there must be more to her. Another not that likable character in my opinion again.Then there is Russell Crowe who actually is one of the better characters here, but I can't say his character was that ""likable"" either. Sofia Boutella, same thing.So, no likable characters makes a bad movie. This movie has no heart or any warmth to it. Was there anyone in the end who had genuinely good intentions or was everyone after something at other peoples expense?Good? The visuals and scenery were nice, but thats it. It was a bit of a combination of a Roland Emmerich and a Michael Bay movie. Huge fx and long lenses in the desert sunset. I need to point out that there are also a lot of very dark scenes. I watched this during daytime at home (not optimal ofcourse) and there were many scenes which were basically all black. So dim your lights when watching this.

This is the studio's attempt to have a multi-character universe linking movies ala Marvel's Avengers. Watching the Mummy I feel that Universal should wrap it up already. If this movie is the first one, I am sure not going to spend good money to see any of the other films. Usually you try and put your best product out to reel potential viewers in for your future films, but this movie will turn viewers away.Is it that bad? No, but it is not very good. This movie has a below average script, a lot of the usual mummy clichés, and average direction. You do not leave the theater feeling robbed, but you do not leave feeling entertained either.

186,darkdementress,Utter trash.,1,15 August 2020,"The Cinemasins video sums up this trash heap perfectly. It's corny, it's cringy,the writing makes no sense, it's completely illogical, complete nonsense! Even if it was all those things in a good movie I could at least accept it but it's not. It's a terrible. The entire premise is that an evil mummy is coming back to kill everyone because reasons.. Convenient eye holes in the mummy wrappings hahaha wow. Oh and did I mention that the movie starts with about eight minutes of Russell Crowe narration? Did you even remember he was in the film later, cuz i didn't. Ok so the whole entire point of being mummified was to preserve the body for the trials that got you into the afterlife, and you had to have a perfectly intact body do this. But this was made by white people for white people so why would it be based on any sort of ancient Egyptian truth?.. Basically if they really wanted to keep this super evil chick from coming back they would have just cut her body up into a thousand pieces and let the vultures eat her while guards stood by to make sure the birds ate all the pieces and then killed birds and then burned said birds.. Not to mentioned because the mummy was female they had to make her makeout with all the guys that she made into zombie things.. Why are they zombie things? That has nothing to do with ancient Egypt or mummies. Because modern relatability?? Spiders are not part of ancient Egypt either. The female main character is also pretty much entirely pointless,super unlikable and annoying so somehow this makes the super old Tom Cruise seem more likeable??.. Uh no. How do those tiny chains hold the mummy? Cuz the movie needed them to yet it makes no sense. Why does she even want Tom Cruise? Is she lonely? Codependent? Listen ladies you don't need a man to feel whole, you good girl! Tim Cruise surreee loves running in his movies. The end... Siiigghhh..",The Mummy
187,asifahsankhan,"Violence, Action and Not-So-Scary Images, and for some suggestive content and partial nudity, the film, like Cruise's character, a ""lovable rogue by premise only.""",6,12 June 2017,"Don't think I didn't like it or anything, but still... It's fitting that Russell Crowe's Dr. Henry Jekyll is set up to be the Nick Fury of Universal Pictures' ""Dark Universe"" franchise, because the version of ""The Mummy"" that kicks it off has a heck of a split personality: not great, perhaps, but plenty of fun when it stays in its lane with mummies serving as a means to zombie-movie mayhem and the sort of big, fancy action sequences that star Tom Cruise dives into like few others. It can be a real downer when it tries to set up something larger, enough to sabotage what works and maybe make a viewer resent the world-building.As sole heir to the Pharaoh, Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) seems destined to become a queen and to attain power over all of Egypt. But when the Pharaoh's wife unexpectedly bears him a son, Ahmanet sees her fated fortunes quickly slipping from her grasp. Determined not to allow anything – or anyone – alter her path, she makes a pact with the God of Death, and then proceeds to murder her father and brother. Moments before completing the ritual that would incarnate the demonic deity, Ahmanet is captured by the Pharaoh's guards and buried alive in a heavily fortified crypt.5,000 years later, Army reconnaissance specialist and treasure hunter-for-hire Sergeant Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) steals a map from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) that leads him straight to the Egyptian tomb. Unwittingly releasing Ahmanet from her underground prison, Morton begins seeing visions of the princess' ghastly plans to finish what she started so many centuries ago. Now, with time running out and Ahmanet's strength steadily returning, Nick and Jenny must attempt to stop their sadistic pursuer and break the curse that binds the soldier to the Mummy. The nine-year gap between mummy films released by Universal Pictures should have been enough of a reason to revisit the franchise. But the filmmakers behind this latest iteration weren't content with simply utilising the advancements in technology and special effects and makeup to bring the legendary monster to a new generation of audiences. Instead, they had loftier aspirations, hoping to combine multiple horror properties to jump- start a multi-feature series along the lines of Marvel and DC's superhero universes. So it's particularly unfortunate that this inaugural entry is so lacklustre in so many areas.The premise itself is nothing new, though the setting has shifted from Egypt to Iraq (bringing the inhabitants into more modern times), and the mummies have gone from stumbling, bandaged corpses to speedy, crusader knight zombies (moving with twitchy like something out of ""Silent Hill"" and offering helpful UN-dead visitations like something out of ""An American Werewolf in London""). The gods are back, as are the accursed rituals (always done in the nude), the martial arts with staffs/sceptres, and the bugs (hairy camel spiders make for a decent substitution for scarabs). But the hero here is also bestowed with the familiar invincibility that Brendan Fraser and company were granted during their former theatrical endeavours. ""Where's your sense of adventure?"" Yet with a continual imperiousness to harm, the adventures are never genuinely suspenseful.To its credit, ""The Mummy"" does adopt a darker tone than before, beginning with a ""Prometheus""-type exploration of underground ruins (complete with a complex pulley system that still works perfectly after millennial of disuse) before reverting to its horror movie roots through creepy character designs and slow stalking by its witch-y villain (the comic relief has also decreased substantially). Blood, gore, dead bodies, jump scares, nightmarish imagery, and wandering around in the dark with piercing flashlight beams are prevalent elements, making this much more of a horror venture than the previous, action-based pictures. However, there are still a number of impressively-designed stunts (they look great but are of questionable execution, especially as so many components can be computer generated these days), even if the attention is focused on the sudden, unnerving, spasmodic movements of zombie antagonists and the flesh-sucking capabilities of the main mummy (like the baddies of ""Lifeforce"" or ""Hellraiser""). Sadly, many of the fight sequences are so chaotic that they conceal the nature of the choreography.Of course, even the good parts have their issues. There's a lot of ""I just know"" plotting going on, sometimes repeated multiple times because Kurtzman and the writers can't seem to figure out a way to not spring things on the audience unfairly and also have the characters learn things they need to know. There's no romantic tragedy here, the way there is in the best previous Mummy films, leading to a less interesting villain. There's an interesting potential substitute in Ahmanet's thwarted ambition, but the writers never really dig into that as a tragic flow rather than a way to scale things up for the Dark Universe.",The Mummy
188,FelipeCarrillo,"Here, The Mummy is not the monstrous thing",6,20 August 2017,"The surprises, keeping re-encounter with one of the classic wonders par excellence, owned by Universal Pictures, are constricted. Among this narrow mosaic of satisfactions is what would be a comforting and palpitating beginning. It's symbolized by the antithesis of company's opening emblematic logo, restyled by shades of gold, ochre and black colors that are placed on the anterior side of that globe that is embraced by the name of the studio, here replaced by a grandiloquent Dark Universe— that wasn't projected in the TV ads to contain the surprise factor. Trying to emulate the retributive equation created by Marvel Studios with its cosmos of cinematic superheroes—of course, it's based on its own comics—, Universal plans to outline its universe by reusing the characters that must be untouchable because of their one-of-a-kind legacy in cinema history, however, Hollywood's rejection of creativity, a true eyesore deserving its corresponding movie, has begun to pick on, without embarrassment and with enough paraphernalia, the monsters in order to satisfy the demands of the Millennials about knowing those dark beings. Classics of yesteryear such as ""Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" or ""The Invisible Man"" are going to resurrect in the upcoming years with the help of Johnny Depp, Julian Bardem and undeniably a compendium of actors and actresses that are currently shining in the mecca of American cinema. ""Dracula Untold"", starring Luke Evans, was kicked off but it was harshly criticized for the loss of focus portraying the ""never told"" story of this iconic and lethal vampire. Due to this economic and reception (by both critics and audiences) flop, the studio didn't give up and started over with a clean slate, omitting such box office bomb, supposedly, to reorganize the pretensions and start on the right foot this mega-project, but what would be the story that would really redeem the master Dracula? ""The Mummy"".Mythology and/or legends encompass myriad opportunities and Hollywood sharp brains have been able to take advantage of these to raise the first dark universe of history. After a round of flowers and applause by films with a large audience response and a revival led by Hammer Films in the 50s, North American cinematic mecca Universal Pictures inaugurates its corresponding movie voyage with Dr. Henry Jekyll—the counterpart of Marvel's Nick Fury—, who's the director and creator of the surreptitious organization ""Prodigium"", whose mission is to recognize, contain, examine and destroy any evil entity stepping on the ground. The first to realize her not so triumphant entry is Princess Ahmanet, interpreted by Sofia Boutella (""Kingsman: The Secret Service"").After watching the film, one can conclude that the biggest flaw, both independent movie and inaugural work, is the feeble structuring in plot terms, because, although the introduction of the antagonist and the retrospective scenes independent Nick firmly consolidate the first act, it's difficult to feel that constant and seductive ecstatic that encompassing the Mummy, verbi gratia, in Brendan Fraser's 1998 film. Such a narrative failure originates consequents that keep on to harm the audiovisual tale; the first one comes in the name of the selfsame main actor, who had active participation in the conception of the script, for, in the end, provoke prominent interventions in the footage that should come from the true star, giving prominence to a character who will surely have weight in future installments, thus giving cause to the second big mistake: not deciding what specific genre(s) and tone(s) for the universe due to the hasty narrative ending. Is it a horror or comedy film, an initiation/Nick Morton or a mummy film, an adventure or suspense one? The film doesn't cease in production of subliminal messages for the audience on the occasion of informing of the large flow of monsters that are coming, introducing with little fluency references and signs of upcoming films. The third blemish comes from the sketch of characters, another subject in which the team of writers doesn't come out well. Having to dip into the ideas of six screenwriters ( an impressive amount that strengthens my theory about the pitiful result made by the mixture of various minds), the general story is admissible, full stop, however, Cruise's role doesn't have enough power and maturity to keep up a complete journey at his. On the other side of the coin, Boutella gives her character sensuality and intimidating flexibility while Russell Crowe is the ideal actor and with the fiber required to lead this universe hanging by a thread.The Mummy's female version in Kurtzman's movie flaunts different presentations ranging from an inhuman entity that drags to the aphrodisiac and intimidating look that spends most of the time chained or stealing people's lives by lip contact. The places in which the tale develops tend opacity, a complex of special effects that are supported in a palette of pessimistic colors and tones in terms of transmitting, without any success, dread, and insecurity the work must produce. As for technical aspects, they stand out for the first-rate execution of the best action sequence in the film: The plane crash, although it doesn't propose anything deeply novel in the action movie matter, managed to stir within me, thanks to furious-paced timing, an unexplained anxiety for the future of the characters, a well- deserved applause for this achievement both technical and artistic.""The Mummy"" (2017) by Alex Kurtzman is a frustrating setback and inaugural disruption in the optimistic plans of Universal. A work that could not show its possibilities because of an unsatisfactory attempt to get what Marvel's equation has built, and even DC's one. Ideas straying in the disorder of pretensions. Apparently, just as Disney, Universal must mummified already conceived plans to awaken new aces under the sleeve quickly.",The Mummy
189,Chalice_Of_Evil,If you enjoy seeing Tom Cruise get the living snot beat out of himthen this is the movie for you!,6,8 June 2017,"Universal Pictures' first 'Dark Universe' movie didn't exactly bode well for what was supposed to come after. Hoping to create an interconnecting universe of classic monsters doesn't work if you haven't thought things through, and as others have speculated, this felt like it wasn't properly planned out at all. The previous iteration of The Mummy, the 1999 version starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, mightn't have been a 'masterpiece', but it was a good old-fashioned action/adventure movie that was at least FUN and *entertaining*. This one? Not so much.The movie gets off to a rocky start, with a rather dull/boring opening (featuring a crusader buried with a red jewel which will become important later). This is followed by what feels like a rushed backstory for the movie's title character, the mummy herself, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella, who deserves so much better than this to show her talents. She was the only reason I even watched this movie), which isn't anything new/exciting. She did something bad, tried to raise some ancient evil, but the ritual was interrupted and she got mummified for her trouble (in a surprisingly less gruesome flashback than Imhotep's from the '99 movie).We're then introduced to one of the least heroic 'heroes' ever, Tom Cruise's Nick Morton, and his offsider, Jake Johnson's Vail, in a typical shoot-'em-up/explosions aplenty action scene that somehow manages to be unexciting. They're 'liberators of precious antiquities' (ie. looters/thieves) and Nick is quite the jerk. Annabelle Wallis' Jenny Halsey agrees, as her entrance involves her delivering a well-deserved slap to Nick's face (he slept with her so he could steal from her). They're soon thrown together by Courtney B. Vance's man-in-charge, Colonel Greenway, and descending into a big hole where, you guessed it, they unwittingly awaken Ahmanet.Whilst transporting said corpse via airplane, things start getting hairy when Vail (looking the worse for wear after having been bitten by a creepy-crawly) turns all murder-y and Nick's forced to put him down. Birds start hitting the plane and it plummets. In a seemingly heroic move, Nick gives what is supposedly the last parachute to Jenny and saves her life (it's later revealed this wasn't such a 'heroic' act after all), then he next wakes up in a morgue post-crash. Before you can say ""An American Werewolf in London"", Nick's seeing Vail looking all corpsified and gross as he delivers snark/ominous messages to Nick who is also experiencing visions of Ahmanet. Seems he's been 'chosen' by her for a second attempt at raising that ancient evil with the ritual she was so rudely interrupted during the middle of previously. It involves a dagger and that red jewel.Cruise and Johnson attempt to convey camaraderie between their characters, but their 'banter' falls flat. There's not much humour in this movie, and what little it has rarely works. The biggest laugh in my theatre came from Jenny's reaction to seeing Ahmanet straddling Nick at one point. I think calling her character 'useless' is a bit unfair. She saves Nick at least once or twice (which is kind of her, considering he was going to ditch her/leave her to fend for herself against the mummy's minions at one point, not to mention he's constantly being condescending towards her and dismissing things she says/warnings she gives) and she's certainly less of a jerk than him. The romance that Cruise and Wallis try to make work between their characters doesn't really succeed much (there's a line uttered by Nick to Jenny towards the end of the movie which Wonder Woman did SO much better).Meanwhile, as mentioned elsewhere, you'd think that a movie titled 'The Mummy' would, you know, have more of the actual MUMMY in it. Alas, poor Sofia Boutella is underutilized. She does what she can with the material she's given (probably her best/most effective scene was the one she shared with Jenny after having been captured/imprisoned). I was almost on Ahmanet's side rather than Nick's. Sadly, Ahmanet's powers aren't as interesting as Imhotep's were (except for the neat trick with the irises/pupils in her eyes splitting in two), though at one point she does pull the same face-appearing-in-sandstorm stunt as he did. At least she gets to toss Nick around like he's a ragdoll...so that's something. Too bad she wasn't better utilized here (and there won't be any future installment to rectify that problem).Russell Crowe feels like he's acting in a different movie as Dr. Henry Jekyll. At least he looks like he's trying to have some 'fun' with the role, but even when we're introduced to Mr. Hyde (who isn't really much different to Jekyll, other than having a different accent/looking all veiny), it's not enough to save this film. There's cameo appearances by some of the 'classic' monsters (in the form of pieces of them in jars), but the movie as a whole lacks cohesion. The ending's especially WTF-worthy, as the impact of certain characters' deaths is completely undone (not that they *had* much impact to begin with), how Nick 'saves the day' is rather anticlimactic, and what happens to/becomes of him is somewhat vague.As much as I wanted to like this film, it's just hard to find anything particularly memorable about it. The action scenes aren't anything special (the only half-decent one is the plane crash sequence), the characters' dynamics aren't that interesting, there's no snappy dialogue, not much depth and nothing really that makes you go ""Wow!"" (unless your ""Wow!"" is immediately followed by ""That was BAD!"" in reference to the movie). I don't mean to sound so harsh, but it feels like all this movie achieved was setting up what was yet to come, and even then it doesn't appear as if they had a clear idea of what exactly was going to happen. It's little wonder that the 'Dark Universe' failed to become a thing after this sub-par first outing. Do yourself a favour and see Wonder Woman instead (and if you've watched it already...then watch it again!).",The Mummy
190,GomezAddams666,Welcome to a new world of mediocrity.,6,7 June 2017,"""Dead is just the beginning"", right? In this case it might be the beginning of the end of the world of gods and monsters. I have been dwelling on how to review this movie as I want to be fair but I don't want to mislead you.I will start by saying that Sofia Boutella nails the character of Princess Ahmunet, she is truly a goddess with of course an ancient course that she brought upon herself, but her character is so likable you actually end up rooting for the ultimate evil, Boutella brings a charisma to the mummy that it is hard to match.My biggest fear going in was Russell Crowe as doctor Henry Jekyll and his other persona, Mr Edward Hyde, but the actor gives the performance of his lifetime as both characters and his seedy organization, which is truly as evil and ruthless as the ""monsters"" they chase. And this is how I like my ""heroes"", men or groups that for the common ""good"" are willing to become monsters themselves, it makes for an interesting plot.Here's where things go sideways: Tom Cruise, yes I said it. Nick Morton is an amalgamation of Rick O'Connell of the Brendan Fraiser movies and Ethan Hawk from M:I. His character lacks charisma and his romance with Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) is less than believable. It borders in a cheap Fabio novel paper back, the movie would have been much better without Tom Cruise and Nick Morton.Here's where things go bad: The special effects, last year I hammered Ghostbusters for their ""Scooby-like"" CGI and it pains me as I have to do the same here, the CGI was awful, seriously! When a TV Show like Game of Thrones can have great FX there is absolutely no excuse to have a big franchise movie, the start of one had FX so incredibly awful, they looked like a freaking cartoon. That seriously killed the movie.There are a couple of good scenes but I have to say sadly that the Dark Universe is dead, or at least it should be.My rating is 6 out of 10, and I'm being nice.Welcome to a new world of meh...",The Mummy
191,rparham,Don't unwrap this Mummy,5,10 June 2017,"In Hollywood's current insatiable drive to build ""franchises"" and therefore guarantee some degree of repeat box office success by plumbing the wallets of ravenous fanboys (and girls), Universal has joined the derby that Disney, with it's Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars, and Warner Bros., with the DC Extended Universe, has been dominating thus far (although Disney has quite the leg up on Warners). Universal's answer is what they are calling the ""Dark Universe"", an intertwined conglomeration of their famous movie monsters that were first birthed in the 1930s. The inaugural entry to kick off this franchise is a new version of The Mummy, and if this film is any indication of what is to follow, the Dark Universe may be in trouble.Unlike previous iterations of The Mummy, this one doesn't just have the obligatory backstory set in ancient Egypt, but throws other, somewhat inexplicable, elements into the screenplay blender involving Knights of the Crusade entombed beneath London. Their last resting place contains a jewel that, when combined with a specific dagger, will allow the God of death, Set, to possess a human body (why are ancient curses like cake recipes: leave out one crucial ingredient and your dead won't rise). We are also introduced to Egyptian Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) who thousands of years ago decides to commit patricide and infanticide against her father and brother (step-brother I think, but the screenplay is a little fuzzy on that) because she wasn't going to be the ""rightful"" heir to the Egyptian throne. For her crimes she is mummified alive and condemned to an underground prison in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) because the Egyptians decided they didn't want to throw out their trash in their own backyard. Cut to modern day and Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), a long range reconnaissance officer who uses his role to also procure rare antiquities, he claims to rescue them from destruction, but more accurately to line his pockets. With his partner in crime, Chris Vail (Jake Johnson), they unwittingly discover Ahmanet's prison. Along with archaeologist Jenny (Annabelle Wallis), whom Nick had a one night stand with, they retrieve Ahmanet's remains and airlift them to London.En route, a flock of crazed birds assault their plane, leading to its crash in the English countryside, but even though Jenny was the only one to parachute to safety, Nick isn't dead. He is revealed to now Ahmanet's ""chosen"" that she will use the aforementioned dagger and jewel on to bring Set to corporeal life. Nick learns this with the help of one Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe), the head of the mysterious organization that Jenny works for, who in addition to keeping Ahmanet under control has his hands full submerging his dark side. Needless to say, Ahmanet doesn't go quietly, and various degrees of chaos ensues, including zombies and sandstorms as she pursues both Nick and the jewel for her dagger.The Mummy is Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking on pure autopilot: grab an A-list star (although, outside of the Mission: Impossible entries, Cruise is no longer the guaranteed draw he once was), throw in a striking villain, a respected thespian in a supporting role, a sexy love interest, some occasional one-liners and a bunch of elaborate computer enhanced action sequences, and viola, a movie is given life. But just as when something mass-produced misses the touch of craftsmanship, The Mummy lacks any real reason for being than the hope that the pre-sold notion of a title and promise of future entries will put butts in seats. The script also lacks internal logic often, with certain events occurring that seem inexplicable if you were to follow what was stated earlier in the film.It doesn't help that there are very few endearing character elements in place in The Mummy. Cruise flashes his famous smile, but his Nick is so self-involved and unlikeable that Cruise's usual charm comes across as more like smarm this time. His ""romance"" with Wallis' Jenny is completely dead on arrival, neither actor selling any degree of chemistry or real affection, so that when dialogue and actions suggest a devotion to each other later in the film, it comes across as patently false. Boutella, who made a distinct impression as the murderous henchwoman in Kingsman: The Secret Service and as Jaylah in last summer's Star Trek Beyond, is given little of note to do here than slink around in limited clothing and look menacing (it would have been a nice break from the norm for the standard prologues to flesh her out a bit, but alas, no such luck). The one bright spot is when Crowe temporarily lets his Mr. Hyde out and brandishes a thick Cockney accent and revels in chewing the scenery. The visual and makeup effects for the transformation underwhelm (he primarily just turns . . . purple), but Crowe seems to be enjoying himself.Perhaps most disappointed will be audience members coming in search of an actual horror film, since that is what all these creatures were originally featured in during their heyday at Universal. Those films were pieces of mood, atmosphere and lighting, awash in elements of German expressionism. Aside from a few tepid shock scares, the only thing terrifying here is that respected screenwriters David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie have their names attached to what will be a lackluster entry on their resumes (hopefully the payday was worth it). To produce something actually scary would have potentially affected box offices grosses, so that would be a distinct no-no.There are a few things here and there that are decent about The Mummy, some of the action sequences are well staged, Brian Tyler's orchestral score is engaging as usual, but overall we are treated to a movie as product, where quality is sacrificed to hear the sound of cash registers ringing. The sad reality is, by putting out such a second rate film, Universal execs will most likely hear that ringing less than they could have.",The Mummy
192,kevinxirau,The world of gods and monsters could use more effort.,4,22 June 2017,"Shared universes are all the craze now; Marvel, DC, Monsterverse (Godzilla+Kong), etc. I suppose it's fitting that the Universal Monsters joined in, especially since they were the ones who invented shared universes way back in the old days. This year marks the debut of the new Dark Universe with the release of ""The Mummy"". How does this movie hold up? Eh, I've seen better; then again, I've seen worse too.Plot: Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), some sort of soldier/mercenary/treasure hunter (honestly, does it really matter what he is?), unearths an Egyptian tomb in the Middle-East and accidentally frees Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who seeks to use him to bring an evil from another world into our own. Even with the help of the monster-hunting organization Prodigium, headed by Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (Russell Crowe), Nick's fate as well as the world hangs by a thread.For this film, I kept my expectations low as well as an open mind when faced with this new film series as it did show potential. Some ideas were cool like Dr. Jekyll being in charge of Prodigium (fitting given his character and Crowe gives the best performance by the way), how this rather attractive Mummy shows off her powers, and nods to the other Universal Monsters and previous Mummy incarnation. The film also offers some decent action like the airplane scene and maybe one or two little scares. However, those are really the best the movie has to offer. The main characters aren't particularly interesting nor offer any surprises (Jake Johnson in particular annoyed me and had little purpose), the humor is hit-or-miss, the romance unearned, and there's nothing truly thrilling throughout. There's also a point where the Mummy starts speaking English and it's never elaborated on how this was accomplished, just one of those distracting things.Perhaps the biggest flaw is that the second-third of the film is dedicated to world-building, detracting from the title monster that is supposed to be the central conflict. This is a mistake ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" among others made, sacrificing telling a complete story just for setting up sequels (thus earning a great deal of criticism and often leading to franchise cancellation), something both Marvel and the Monsterverse have largely avoided.In short, ""The Mummy"" offers minimal entertainment at best. It doesn't fail at establishing a shared universe as much as others like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", but it also doesn't offer more than being just an action-adventure film and one that lacks any real charm at that. For now, the Dark Universe is on shaky ground.",The Mummy
193,dakjets,Disappointing,5,26 October 2017,"I had my hopes .... but this is not very good. Tom Cruise's Mummy movie could have been very good. He fits very well in action films like this, and adventure movies too. But here's a lot issues to call this really entertaining: 1) The story is not very inventive. We've seen this before. 2) To be a movie with a big budget, the special effects are not particularly good. 3) When the film begins to be exciting, it breaks into strange sequences. Russell Crowe's performance in the middle of the film is a good example of this. As always, I think Tom Cruise delivers well. But the rest of the actors do not impress. And the mummy is not scary enough for me. Disappointing.",The Mummy

Vance, Marwan Kenzari, Javier Botet, Selva Rasalingam, Dylan Smith, Chasty Ballesteros, Rez Kempton, Shanina Shaik, Vera Chok, Tyrone Love, and Sean Cameron Michael Directed By: Alex Kurtzman Review Back in 2014 right when I saw Dracula Untold I heard that Universal was trying to make a cinematic universe out of there monsters. Dracula, The Wolfman, Creature From The Black Lagoon, The Mummy, Dr. Jeykell & Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing Frankenstein & his monsters, I thought it was the coolest idea. Dracula Untold is not a part of this however, I knew it wouldn't be because they said The Mummy would they just added an end credit scene to that film just in case. The Mummy movies with Brendan Frasier I don't like them because they seem like great action/adventure movies but it has Brendan Frasier and he's not an action star and I find it unrealistic he would be able to defeat a mummy because he's never done any action movies before or after that. But again they made this film with a lot of action but dark and creepy with good horror and at least this time around they got a real action star my main man Tom ""crazy"" Cruise. The Mummy has Nick Morton who is cursed after releasing Ahmanet. Nick is a thief who steals antiquities and sells them on the black market for a higher price. After being cursed Jenny finds him and he keeps seeing his partner and having visions of Ahmanet. She wants to use Nick to bring back Set and reclaim her rightful place as queen. This movie wasn't as bad as the reviews are saying not to say it has no flaws cause it's got some, trust me. I heard that this just one big set up movie, how? All there is a bunch of easter eggs in prodigum, it's not like Henry said this is Dracula who's over in his place, this is a monster made by a man named Frankenstein, there's another guy with a situation like yours who becomes a half wolf half man, no just stuff in jars. Tom Cruise was great he gave it his all, Annabelle Wallis was good not great, and the standouts are Russel Crowe and Sofia Boutelli. The action is amazing especially in the beginning where I said it feels like the uncharted movie Sony should be making but won't because there idiots. One of my favorite things about the movie is the cinematography or the atmosphere I might say like when it's shot in the dark it looks visually creepy and then you see the corpses walking around and Ahmanet and the last like ten/thirty minutes that was cool. Oh and the Cg is great, not bad at all. But the thing that it really got wrong was the jokes felt very forced, and I like Jake Johnson as an actor but he was super annoying! Aside from those two things nothing much else bothered me, no resolution I heard one review say, no it has one but then it leads it open for a sequel later and well it was okay. Got some flaws but it's fun it's dark I had fun. I'm giving The Mummy a four out of five.",The Mummy

But bad direction misguides Tom Cruise, that's why I am not satisfied even from his acting. But he tried his best. Tom Cruise should emphasize on the other section as he is more experienced than the director, as I don't like the direction of this movie. Russell Crowe is great in this movie. Only he deserve appreciation for his acting. On the other hand, the main villain character, an important one though, is totally crap. She is not fit this heavy roll. I disliked this point very much. The other castings are also fade. However some illogical as well as confused events made the popular title a reluctant one to the fans of this franchise. The theme is enjoyable but direction, silly casting and Tom Cruise himself can not make the enjoyable movie a great one. Thus it is now only an enjoyable one, one time watch movie.

While it was not always as grim as the subject matter would/should require it to be, it never reduced itself to guttural comedic levels like Blade and Aliens did. So I was not disappointed. That said, it is not as good as The Mummy from 1999, nor any of its sequels.

It's a shame that Universal has allowed the production of a weak product. This is the beginning of the ""Dark Universe"" and that only makes even more painful this failed attempt to create a universe of films that could work better independently. It is the worst movie I've seen in months because it reaches the minimum levels of entertainment and the plot has more holes than Princess Ahmanet dresses.

200,lotekguy-1,"Mummy mostly missing from muddled, mediocre movie",2,9 June 2017,"SPOILER ALERT - This review contains plenty, but the film makers deserve them! Reasons not to watch this turkey: 1- Sofia Boutella, who was mesmerizing as the springblade-legged assassin in Kingsman: The Secret Service, is completely wasted in this drab role, despite playing the title character. 2- Tom Cruise, as the reanimated Mummy's new love interest and/or destiny fulfiller, gets far more screen time than Boutella, making it a supernatural Mission Improbable flick. 3- The plot, such as it is, involves a foxy, ambitious princess, poised to become the next pharaoh until daddy sires a son, who jumps ahead in the line of succession the moment the midwife spanks his princely bottom. That leads her to strike a deal with Set, the God of the Dead. She fillets the rest of her family before anyone can breed again. Then she would kill a lover, whose body Set would inhabit for a long and happy reign of torturing everyone else...together. That failed; she was mummified alive and buried in Iraq for a few millennia, until a couple of US soldiers of dubious character (Cruise and Jake Johnson)accidentally un-bury her with an airstrike during our national misadventures over there. By amazing coincidence, a comely British archaeologist (Annabelle Wallis) Cruise had just boinked to snatch an ancient map from her, arrives on the scene to schlep the crypt to England, where other artifacts essential to the old plot were also unearthed. 4- Her boss (Russell Crowe) is Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. Literally. That one. No explanation for how he's still alive in the present, or not fictional, or not living under a pseudonym.In Australia. 5- After reading such a dreadful script, Cruise must have signed on because he thought this spin on an ancient religion made Scientology seem relatively palatable. 6- The drivel factor includes repetitive exposition (even repeating scenes of the backstory), making its 110 minutes seem even longer. 7- The CG action sequences are mostly shot with so little lighting that it's hard to get the adrenaline boost most viewers seek when choosing such fare. 8- The only character who deserves our empathy dies early in the going...lucky stiff. 9- The movie's lame ending actually sets up a sequel!!!! Hubris, thy name is Hollywood. 10 - If they try to make one, suitable working titles could be Bill and Ted's Excrement Adventure, Dawn of the Dud, or Raiders of the Lost Art. Note: This may be my harshest review since Bill Cosby's Ghost Dad, and that was in 1990 when I was still one of his fans.",The Mummy

Just when you thought that nothing new might come of an old story, (and an old movie reel-1932), the ever-imaginative mind of Hollywood comes up with an almost new riff on an old line...or maybe not. Tom Cruise, recently stirring up sci-fi and horror genres, after previous more notable efforts as hot-shot pilot, or military lawyer, etc., now gives us the average guy v a horrid, haughty hottie, aka The Mummy, a movie that no one was waiting for. If you saw the trailer for the movie, a sarcophagus being hauled in a large transport aircraft, then you saw the most compelling scene in the movie. Aside from the hot mummy girl writhing in sexually suggestive scenes, or using her powers to forcefully show the vengeance of a woman scorned, there is little that is entertaining in this flick. Watch the 1930's version, or even Hammer Films 1950's take. Both are superior films to this modern remake.",The Mummy

In short, no point giving you a synopsis, scriptwriters clearly didn't have a clue what the story is about, just some dead chick in bandages. What makes it even more shockingly bad is to have 'A' list actors, Cruise & Crowe in it. Whats good: The film, sort of, starts off looking good Whats bad: Everything else. Rapidly you realise that the script is yet another one of those written by Hollywood chimps beating on keyboards.A story has a beginning, middle and end. You can beat about the bush how and when you arrive at these points in the story. But you must arrive at some time. This film, wanders off into the wilderness of WTF moments, Why? What? How? Mix in some over done CGI and awful shots, bad acting (to be fair with a rubbish script they don't stand a chance) . Throw in some awful costumes - eg the 'scary' character Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) you can see is wearing a grey body stocking , naff crepe and a visible push up bra. It rather destroys the illusion of supposedly evil, long dead mummified character. Oh! and someone needs to explain to the chimps, what happens when a body is mummified.

They see a sarcophagus hanging by a chain. Nick shoots a chain to free the sarcophagus. Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) thanks Nick in a vision for freeing her. Vail gets bitten by a camel spider and later his behavior changes and dies. They take the sarcophagus back to London but the plane crashes and Nick wakes up in the morgue and is alive. Vail is dead but tells Nick the Princess saved him and now controls him. Oh, oh.Here's the thing: Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe) wants Nick to be stabbed by the dagger with red jewel that will give him immortality and save the world. Nick isn't buying this, of course. In the meantime we see Princess Ahmanet bound by chains but we know that won't last long.The rest of the movie is Nick running from Princess Ahmanet and her soldiers who were dead and now alive. Yes, the CGI is absolutely fantastic, but this is basically the whole movie. So if you like, and I mean really like CGI this is for you. I was greatly disappointed that this was the case. Very little dialogues and Dr. Jekyll is trying to find the jewel that attaches to the dagger so he can stab and kill Nick. Ha!I kept seeing Ethen Hunt from those Mission Impossible movies when I watched Tom Cruise and maybe someone else should have played Nick. Maybe. Still I enjoyed Cruise's performance, but I still saw him as Ethan Hunt. I cannot be blamed for this because Cruise is most identified with that character.Basically, this movie is a CGI-fest as it takes up most of the movie. How does this all end? I really would like to tell you and this is the twist you (and I ) didn't see coming, but no can do. HA! The movie does leave an interpretation for sequels and we hope this doesn't happen.

204,AnishMisra,The Mummy Review,5,4 March 2018,"The Mummy is a film co-written and directed by Alex Kurtzman. The trailers for the film were just OK and it didn't raise my expectations a bit. I just needed an excuse to see Tom Cruise. After watching the film, I can say that I was not entirely dissapointed either.Plot: Nick Morton, accidentally unearths the ancient tomb of an entrapped Egyptian princess, Ahmanet.Story and direction: This film was going to be the first installment of the so called 'Dark Universe'. Now that Universes are very famous, each and every Hollywood Studio is cashing onto this opportunity. But what gets affected is the story of the film. Each scene of this film felt like I was seeing another movie. It's like they had four or five movies and crammed it to get one movie. Also the comedy of the film is very forced. It doesn't feel natural. The women of this film are sexualized to most extent, which is very sad. The action (which is one thing that Tom Cruise gets right is every film) is also dull. Not a single action scene pumped up my adrenaline. The production design and VFX were impressive. But that would have added more value if the story was interesting.Performances: Tom Cruise was great in his role. I don't know what he got a Razzie Award. Annabelle Wallis was pale. She just did nothing to arouse my interest in her character. The same can be said for Sofia Boutella. Russell Crowe was a big dissapointment too considering the caliber he has. Jake Johnson was the most irritating for me.Verdict: This film should come as a lesson to the big studios that without any story the film deemed to be a bomb at the box office.

Russell Crowe, an actor not afraid to look and act his age tries to lend a bit of dignity to the proceedings as Doctor Jekyll, but looks as though he's wandered onto the wrong set. Maybe Universal should have thrown the Wolf Man and Creature From The Black Lagoon into the mix as well, and gotten this whole sorry Dark Universe thing out of the way in one hit? This one could never hope to stand up against the far superior originals, Boris Karloff's classic 1932 film, and Hammer Films 1959 version both blow this one out of the water for Spooky Atmosphere and storytelling!

206,metalrage666,"A fun, cool ride",7,9 June 2017,"This is a fresh take on the whole mummy genre with much better effects than the Brendan Fraser movies, some genuinely creepy scenes and decent action.I thoroughly enjoyed this. Tom Cruise & Jake Johnson play Nick Morton & Chris Vail and are soldiers of fortune/relic hunters on a mission to locate hidden artefacts to sell on the black market. After stealing a map from a hotel one night stand, Jenny Halsey, they end up in Mesopotamia or modern day Iraq and a local town full of insurgents. After being detected, shot at and running for their lives, they call in an airstrike which accidentally uncovers a lost Egyptian tomb. As the location of the tomb is hundreds of miles from where it should be, they all descend into the tomb and uncover a lost sarcophagus of an Egyptian princess, Ahmanet, who was allegedly erased from history. During this time, Chris is bitten by camel spiders and becomes feverish; despite them not being venomous.At the same time, British workers digging a new underground rail tunnel, break through into an old crusaders tomb from the 12th century and it is revealed that these knights are from the 2nd crusade and the invasion of Egypt, so it is believed that there'll be a number of stolen items buried with them.The sarcophagus from Iraq is transported back to the UK on a C17 and while en-route Chris apparently dies from his bites, is reanimated and stabs the commanding officer and attacks the rest of the crew. The C17 encounters engine trouble and further problems occur when an unnatural murder of crows disables the plane bringing it down in a field adjacent to an old abbey. Jenny Survives after Nick puts a parachute on her and she's ejected from the plane.As it was Nick who released the princess from her prison in Iraq, she has chosen him to be her vessel for the reincarnation of Set, the god of death. Due to this, even though everyone left on the plane died in the crash, Nick is brought back to life and wakes up while still at the morgue.As Nick is spiritually connected to Ahmanet, she convinces him to come back to the Abbey where Ahmanet has killed and reanimated a number of rescue workers and crash site officials into an army of undead helpers. We find out that that next to the abbey is a reliquary where the ceremonial blade of Set was hidden, however the red jewel that makes it work was not kept with the dagger as this was buried separately in the old crusaders tomb back in London. From here on, it's a roller coaster ride of trying to stay alive while at the same time, not have Ahmanet get her hands on the jewel, sacrifice Nick to reincarnate Set and bring about the end of creation. In order to keep Ahmanet from succeeding, Nick kills himself with the blade which results in Set possessing his body. Unfortunately after Nick sees Jenny laying dead from being killed by Ahmanet, He regains temporary control of his body, kills Ahmanet and uses his new powers to resurrect Jenny.When we next see Nick he has again teamed up with and newly resurrected Chris and they are back on the hunt for other relics and adventure.I've read other reviews on this that have crucified this for not having any story or plot, good acting or effects, but considering that this is primarily a horror movie, and that practically ALL mummy movies, going all the way back to the black and white era, are inherently silly in the extreme, to expect anything other than a simple plot and pedestrian formula is equally silly in my opinion. I thought Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe did a good job with the material they had to work with and Sofia Boutella as Ahmanet/Mummy did a great job. The Mummy is certainly a check your brain at the door kind of movie but this is a fun ride from start to finish. The fight scene at the reliquary between Nick and the reanimated horde had me in stitches and the resurrected crusader knights in the London tomb was done quite well; especially the underwater scenes. Don't go in expecting Shakespeare and you'll enjoy this.",The Mummy

208,danielharden,Mumma Mia,4,26 June 2017,"Back in 1999, Brendan Fraser and co. made a name for themselves with the Mummy. The film would then lead onto two sequels, both gradually decreasing in quality, and a short yet fun roller coaster ride. Now, after his not so recent, yet still rather recent, split from creative partner Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman directs a reboot of the Mummy with the intention of creating, what has been called the, 'Dark Universe', for one of Hollywood's Big Six conglomerates, NBCUniversal. This Mummy reboot parallels the start of the DCEU, it's a fall at the first hurdle. What is created is a film that tries to be many things, fully achieving none and is obviously an high concept, studio money maker that sees nothing but green.Where this film fails is its acknowledgement of who its audience is and what it is they want out of a film. The film doesn't seem to pick an audience but instead tries to attract as many people as it can. The film has Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe to attract Tom Cruise and/or Russell Crowe fans, horror themes and elements to attract younger and/or horror fans, blockbuster action and glossy visuals to attract mainstream audiences, and elements of comedy and a world building organisation to attract people you have been absorbed by the MCU and DCEU. The economical intention is clear, however the combination of these elements are contradictory and thus has made the film a failure both critically and commercially. Of all the things the film offers the only thing it seems to deliver is Tom Cruise and a forced attempt at world building. The film falls completely flat as a horror film and horror franchise, for the simple fact that this film is more of a Tom Cruise blockbuster than a genuine attempt to make a horror film franchise. Seriously, its called the 'DARK universe', the audience will be expecting dark horror and monster movies.Many directors, including one of the current industry leaders in horror, James Wan, has been vocal about studio horror and why it is often very bad. As Wan has said, it is because they rely too much on formula and repeated conventions, such as jump scares to get a reaction from their audience. The Mummy is a perfect example of this. There is literally a scene in which two disposable cop characters search a dark location, splitting up and being killed one by one in a jump scare moment... Horror doesn't get more cliché than that. Speaking of cliché, the script is filled with two things; 1) cliché, cringe worthy dialogue and 2) exposition... Lots and lots of painfully boring and unnecessary exposition. I understand there is a lot to explain with mythology and world building and all, but can you actually try and use the camera to explain this for once. As Alfred Hitchcock said ""Dialogue should simply be a sound among other sounds, just something that comes out of the mouths of people whose eyes tell the story in visual terms."" It's also worth noting that the film tries to be funny, obviously taking the MCU approach to cinematic world building, seeing the success of the lighthearted feel of Marvel's films and trying to profit off that. This is however yet another part of the film that proves that The Mummy was not made for the audience, even if the director says so.The Mummy is a cinematic identity crisis. Trying to be so many different things to so many different people, that it ultimately fails at being what it should have been, a horror franchise, and instead becoming a glossy Tom Cruise blockbuster that is barely a 15 certificate. Similar to Wonder Woman, both critics and audiences are in agreement, they both believe that the Mummy simply isn't good. I agree that this is Tom Cruise's worst film and disagree with the director's statement that this was made for audiences, because it clearly is not. The film industry is a business and the goal is to make money, the problem with the Mummy is that this is the only thing made clear to anyone Universal need to focus more on the content of their future Dark Universe films, I don't mean certificate rating content which is what they will think, what I mean is simply decide to be a monster/horror movie universe, stick with it, rip up the rule book and just make a good f*cking film not a marketing accessory.

The studio has tried to capture the old fashioned scare in the dark with a variety of monsters. There is some excellent acting, especially by Russell Crowe.This year hasn't been a particularly good year for movies. Wonder Woman was hard core sexism with extra servings of mindless violence. By comparison, the mummy is a good movie. For starters, the main anti-villain (Sofia Butella as Ahmanet) showed genuine humility and actually showed sincere conflict of feelings, although some of her power scenes were cheesy clichés. Tom Cruise was fine (despite the media badmouthing). If anything challenges the movie, it's inconsistent writing.If you're looking for a meaningful movie, this isn't it. If you're looking for unexpected twists, this is not your movie. If you want an entertaining popcorn flick, this is not on par with GOG V2, but it's about as good as i've seen this year.Skip Wonder Woman (an appalling movie) and watch this instead.

210,vasco_cid,Ethan Hunt went to Iraq and all he got was a lousy mummy.,6,9 June 2017,"Not so much lousy but maybe as forgetful and unnecessary as the T- Shirts that inspired that pun. Truth be told, 2017's The Mummy is the annual Tom Cruise-led action entertainment vehicle, not offering much (if anything) in the way of originality or creativity (the amount of direct reproductions of Brendan Fraser's 1999 flick is staggering). The key difference here is that even Cruise himself, normally competent and adequate in other similar vehicles cannot hide his displacement - it is not (only) even a matter of bad and inconsequential writing, the actor himself doesn't even make much out of a clichéd character. Yet Cruise is supported on one hand by an array of forgetful, serviceable and clumsy supporting male characters (most prominently Jake Johnson's bothersome side-kick) and on the other by two competent and likable female presences in Annabelle Wallis and Sofia Boutella.With as many negatives, you would think that perhaps I disliked The Mummy more than I actually have. The truth is that despite its many shortcomings and linearities, the film is harmless mindless fun; 110 minutes that fly by as easily as a serviceable pilot episode of a B type show - the type you enjoyed yourself while watching but don't quite feel compelled to follow up on. If the planned Dark Universe franchise does kick off, its appeal is now riding on the other classical monsters and, more importantly, on who Universal chooses to helm the respective films, seen as Kurtzman is actually the main responsible for this classical monster's less than adequate revival.",The Mummy
211,TheMovieDoctorful,It Feels Like A Roland Emmerich Film in All The Worst Ways,2,25 October 2018,"The best movie that I can use to compare to Alex Kurtzman's awkward, bland and directionless Mummy remake is Rolland Emmerich's Godzilla; both are soulless, boring, tonally inconsistent and passionless re-imaginings of beloved works that either fundamentally misunderstand their source material or simply don't care enough to adapt it with any kind of love or care, with 2 or 3 neat ideas sprinkled in that only make their overall failures that much more depressing. In the case of The Mummy, the first of those ideas is a female monster, played admittedly quite well by Sofia Boutella (A great actress who, like Amandla Stenberg, keeps appearing in bad movies.) The original 1932 Mummy is perhaps the most patriarchal and masculine of all the classic Universal monster movies, so a gender reversal may not only be justified, but welcome. Who wouldn't want to see a powerful female Mummy leading a meek, little guy to the sacrificial table, while a ragtag team of badass heroines charge in gun blazing to save the day? Apparently Alex Kurtzman wouldn't, hence why he somehow felt the need to give Princess Ahmanet a convoluted and boring motivation involving jealousy of her sibling taking the throne of Egypt. The second of The Mummy's good ideas involves the main character's best friend Vail returning from the grave as a wisecracking, rotting ghost to serve as a guide for Tom Cruise's Nicolas Morton. Many have called this character a rip off of Jack from An American Werewolf in London, but I personally found him to be more tribute and homage than direct knock off. Also, as far as interpretations of Set goes, this film does a far more interesting depiction of the Egyptian God of Chaos and his abilities than Gods of Egypt did. The idea of a hero being fused with the spirit of Set is an admittedly cool one and I would have outright loved it had said hero been an interesting character on his own. Those are all the compliments I got.Bar Sofia Boutella, every actor in this film gives the worst performance of their entire career. The worst of these performances is Russell Crowe, lacking any kind of screen presence or investment as Dr. Jekyll and overacting to an embarrassing degree as Mr. Hyde. I felt sorry for him as I watched him ham up his terrible dialogue behind a mask of CGI garbage. Tom Cruise has gotten the full brunt of the film's criticism as the lead, and while not nearly as terrible as Crowe, his performance is still abysmal. He only seems capable of giving two emotions; confused and scared. It's like if someone decided to take Ellen Page's character from Inception and make her the lead. Annabelle Wallis gives one of the most boring, lifeless and unemotive performances I've ever seen in a Hollywood blockbuster. Calling her a mannequin in this would be generous. Jake Johnson, despite playing a character with incredible comedic potential and having proven himself a talented comedic actor on numerous occasions, is amazingly unfunny here. I don't know if it was the direction or Johnson simply not caring, but he is absolutely insufferable and obnoxious in this film.What can be said about the characters?...You tell me. Much like the aforementioned Godzilla '98, all of the characters here are defined by their bland stereotypes and archetypes and nothing more. Cruise is a superficially charismatic Indiana Jones wannabe, Wallis is the posh, by-the-book intellectual lady (Basically, a deeply more boring version of Rachel Weisz's character from the 1999 Mummy) and Jake Johnson is the wacky best friend. They are entirely defined by their quirks. Most dumbfounding of all, the two characters with perhaps the most bland and uninteresting personalities of all are the ones in most dire need of rich characterization; Russell Crowe's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. These literary icons are defined by the extremities of their personas. Here, Jekyll is a boring, stoic Nick Fury wannabe and Hyde is a yelling, eye bulging caricature with a Cockney accent in place of any actual character.The story is so convoluted and boring, it's hardly even worth mentioning. Rather than a deeply personal and sweepingly romantic psychological Horror like the original, The Mummy (2017) instead ops for a boring and generic ""save the world from a city destroying villain"" concept with absolutely nothing new to separate it from a dozen of its contemporaries. The only interesting thing about it was the idea of Tom Cruise's character sharing a body with the dark God Set, an admittedly original and fascinating twist on the overdone ""Chosen One"" cliche. Everything else reeks of a lack of effort.So the acting sucks, the characters suck and the story sucks...Is the cinematography at least a saving grace? Unfortunately, the cinematography is possibly the ugliest I have seen in a major Hollywood blockbuster in years. Everything (And I mean everything) is either a light grey or a deep blue. Color isn't used to set tone and atmosphere or convey emotion and themes. Rather, it's used because this is what big budget Hollywood films are supposed to look like. I guess that we're just supposed to forget that this was meant to be a remake of a Horror film, because frankly, even a major studio superhero film like Venom had 10x more genuine Horror atmosphere than this. However, while most of those movies will at least offer us one or two memorable shots, this one has absolutely none. For the first installment in a reboot of a franchise that's famous for its beauty, its artistry and its style, the cinematography is not only insulting, it's flat out disgusting.The fact that Ron Meyer can look at this cynical, loud, poorly acted and disrespectful waste of time and honestly call it a better film than The Wolfman (2010), a film made with love and care and depth, just goes to he has no idea what he's doing. No wonder Universal's quality has gone down the toilet.",The Mummy
212,joshbarton15,Pretty dismal start to the Dark Universe,4,10 June 2017,"It goes without saying in today's world that film studios seem hell bent on creating the next big cinematic universe. Ever since the success of Marvel Studios has come about through the MCU, we've seen the likes of Warner Bros. try similar with the DCEU, both made up of a multitude of films that intertwine with one another, and now Universal have joined the party with the Dark Universe. With the vast array of classic monsters that Universal have at their disposal, the Dark Universe really does have great potential and they've gone to one of the classic monsters with The Mummy.When Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) awakens the ancient Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) from her tomb in Iraq, her terrible powers are threatened to be released upon the world. The Mummy is an utter mess, unsure of whether it wants to actually tell a story about an iconic movie monster or just setup the Dark Universe it takes place within. Either way, The Mummy fails in delivering anything worth shouting home about. It'll be quite interesting to see where Universal take their Dark Universe from here on in however, they could have done with making sure its opening film was at least competent.The story and screenplay don't really match up either. This is a universe I'm guessing will be aimed more at adults considering its 15 rating here in the UK, though you wouldn't think that with some of the childish moments that come about in the script. There's one standout action sequence in The Mummy, and it's the much talked about sequence in the crashing plane which they shot in a zero gravity environment. The rest of the action is rather forgettable to be honest, including a very dull finale that lacks any sort of adventure this film should be full of.Coming to the performances, The Mummy features the worst Tom Cruise performance I've seen in a while. He's normally an actor I can depend on to give a solid performance however, he just doesn't deliver here. He's the big star of the film so I knew he was going to get a lot of screen time but I didn't expect it to effect the impact Sofia Boutella has in the titular role so much. Boutella showed she can be a fierce adversary in Kingsman yet she spends most of The Mummy living in Cruise's shadow. Jake Johnson makes for one of the most ridiculous and irritating characters of the year while Russell Crowe gives us one of the funniest cockney accents ever in the dual role of Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde.With the Dark Universe now setup and some future films already announced, my only hope is that they can get better from here. I mean, they surely can't get worse, right?",The Mummy
213,scottmannen1,"Entertaining, But Ultimately A Shadow of the Original",6,10 June 2017,"The Mummy is and has been a series of exciting action with the original two Mummy movies being exciting but at the same time didn't take itself too seriously. 2017 and we are already at the reboot! No Brendan Fraser and no comedy.The Mummy staring Tom Cruise starts off well and good with over the top action in a far away Muslim country. This is where Cruise discovers the Tomb of Ahmenet a female version of the original Mummy. We don't get much backstory on Cruise, just enough to let us know that he is a modern day Indiana Jones that's in it for the money. Before we know it Cruise dies then returns from the dead. Like this movie returning from the dead.This movie tries hard to become a thriller with horror scares, and in a few scenes it actually Archie's that. The missing humour would have added a bit more realism to Cruises character because this incarnation of the treasure hunter has no depth at all. The leading lady also fails to connect with the audience even worse than Cruise.This movie tries hard to be a horror but ultimately falls flat. Even worse is why the heck did they bring Russel Crowe in as Dr.Jekyl? He just shows up out of nowhere as the head of some paranormal agency obsessed with collecting evil paranormal artifacts. The organization is poorly explained having zero backstory and Crowe's character like every other is 2D and terrible. They somehow manage to find Cruise and save his ass at a middle of nowhere location in England...again poorly explained.The core of this movie wants to be scary and paranormal and it does touch those notes in some scenes. Character depth is bad. The cgi is very good along with decent visuals to be expected in this kind of blockbuster. The script is bad and suffers from poor writing..something that not even Tom Cruise could save them from.If you are able to look beyond all of those negative aspects in this movie and go in there to watch it with no pre-conceived notions of excellence then you might enjoy this as some kind of action/horror flick. The original is much better than this one and I would be surprised if they even make a sequel to this failure of a movie that is supposed to be the flagship move for the new Dark Universe horror series. I am being somewhat generous when I give this a 6/10.",The Mummy
214,barbagvido,"Starts out decent, then the plot gets crushed by the weight of its own universe",6,22 June 2017,"The Mummy is a reboot of a classic Universal monster movie and a start of a new cinematic universe, Universal's Dark Universe. It stars Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella and Russell Crowe and is directed by Alex Kurtzman. It tells the story of a man named Nick (played by Tom Cruise) who awakens an ancient mummy which curses him and wants to use him to rebuild the world.The movie started out rather good. After a flashback which gives us a backstory, we are thrown straight into action with an incredibly fun action sequence with a very adventure flick feel to it, something we don't see often in Hollywood anymore. Then the plot kicks in and the premise is quite good, it really looked like it was going somewhere (except for too many cringy jokes). It had intense scenes, almost a horror movie feel at times and a freaky villain. But then, somewhere at mid-point of the movie, the whole plot turns around and basically becomes just a set-up for Dark Universe with so many easter eggs and references that are good on their own, but they don't fit into this movie. You can't just shoehorn in all of that and hope for the best. Even though I enjoyed those references, they made the plot feel very messy. And then we are getting to a climax and all of the sudden it's like none of those ever happened. Like we saw another movie in the second act, and then came back to the one we started watching because none of that setting up is brought up again until the very end which made it feel even more shoehorned in. Also, the climax could have been shorter. But still, with flaws it has, it's not a completely bad movie. I had a good time with it, I was very entertained, and the first half was very good (especially the woods sequence, I loved the woods sequence even though the whole movie turns around after that).This started out good, it had a decent premise, but then the plot turned into a typical setting-up mess we see way too often these days. No one even tries to make a great movie when it comes to franchise anymore, they look way too much into the future movies. That's a bug in Hollywood that has to be fixed. But still, it was a fun movie, so if you are interested, I say go for it.",The Mummy

So original I was meant to see this at the cinema but didn't get a chance and I'm glad as I didn't wast my money. It was on TV so gave it a watch little disappointed as there hyped this film up when it got premiered. I will get to the point the film was okay it had plenty of action and it certainly entertains you but it's a little boring in some scenes. The acting was good but it didn't really have much of a storyline like the other Mummy's it lacked the comedy parts and found it a little predictable in places it doesn't give you the edge of your seat feeling . It's nothing like the original Mummy's so don't get your hopes up. I have seen so much better films in my time the movie was okay not the best. That's why my rating is a 5. Its not what you think it is that's probably why there is mixed reviews.",The Mummy
217,bravesfanc,Low expectations help,5,14 July 2017,"They say this isn't a reboot of the 1999 ""The Mummy"" with Brendan Fraser, but I have to disagree. It's pretty much the exact same plot with poor execution. It's not as funny and the action scenes feel too ""Tom Cruise"" for a ""horror film."" This was not scary at all, nothing made me tense up and worry about any character who was in danger. Much more action oriented like a Tom Cruise film. I wish it were different but I'm always coming back to Tom Cruise. I think he ruined this movie. His attempt at humor with a more than a few one liners were laughable.The mummy played by Sofia Boutella does what she can with what she was given. But it was mostly her walking seductively and raising her arms making things happen. They also wasted the talent of Jake Johnson from New Girl. Something happens to his character very early on and then proceeds to pop up from time to time whenever the plot tells him too.While this is mostly a negative review, I can't hate it for what it was. I wasn't terribly bored and I've seen a lot worse. The fact that I had heard countless times how terrible this was and how my expectations were so low, I'll give this a 5/10 Hopefully, Universal can get this ""Dark Universe"" back on track and make some more entertaining movies because I like the concept and idea, just need the execution.",The Mummy

219,themovieparadise,"Better Than I Expected, But Still Not Great Start for the Dark Universe",6,10 June 2017,"I mentioned before that I wasn't sure what the tone of this movie was going to be. This is a monster movie, and yet you enlist Tom Cruise, one of the biggest action stars working today? All the trailers pointed to this being the next Mission: Impossible, more so than it being a horror movie. So I wasn't sure how they were going to make it work. And, overall, I think they struck an appropriate balance. There are certainly explosive action sequences, and these are excellent in terms of their execution. But I don't think The Mummy loses sight that it's ultimately a horror movie. There are a lot of horror motifs, but it is always infused into the action. I think it really worked to establish an appropriate tone for the movie. One may assume from reading this that I really liked this movie, but I don't. It has a lot of problems. The story is incredibly weak. There were a lot of writers involved in this one movie, and it certainly shows. It's really a mess in terms of storytelling, and the overall script is just poor. There were so many scenes dedicated solely to pointless exposition. Not just a passing couple lines, but straight minutes of characters simply explaining everything you need to know about what happened before and what is about to happen. It was so spoon-fed, as if the filmmakers didn't believe the audience was capable of wrapping their heads around the concept of the movie...",The Mummy
220,wycherleyp-960-470658,A great way to open the dark universe,7,17 June 2017,"There is a lot of bad reviews for this film which I can understand why they have given them but also I don't agree.The way to watch this film is not to think of the 90s Brendan Fraser mummy franchise, yes it is a reboot but that's where it ends. This is a reboot for something bigger than just the mummy films it's the starting point for the dark universe.I found the film to be really good with outstanding performance from Russell crowe as Dr Jekyll and sofia boutella as Ahmanet and not to forget nick Morton played by Tom cruise.The story is similar to the 90s mummy where a power crazed person is caught faced a punishment then buried somewhere, only to be found dug up and evil curse rises. But with this film there is more to it than that, the character building and Easter eggs for what is coming next is brilliant and done in a way that you would think it's a marvel film (it really is that good)With a dark universe on the horizon the mummy film delivered what it was meant to do......and that's open the door to the dark universe Tom cruise to my knowledge has not done a bad film in decades and is impressive in this film but the brilliant former model/dancer sofia boutella is the stand out.The Easter eggs shown are great and the action scenes are as good enough to match films that are currently in theatres. The mummy may be a reboot but it is one that is done really well.",The Mummy
221,nahumthebest,"The story was so simple and predictable that a 10y/o could have written it; however, the movie was done just fine and kept me entertained for the ~100mins; good ending IMO",8,22 July 2017,"Before I watch ANY movie, I check out IMDb to help me make my final decision to watch a movie or not, just like the rest of you. I rarely pay attention to the critics since they're often so full of themselves that they are highly unreliable. I take the IMDb average rating in consideration, but not as an ultimate determinant.I knew this movie had a low average rating, so I kept my expectations low as I went ahead to watch the movie.The original first film was great, and this one does not come close to being as good. But it was actually watchable and I don't feel my 100 minutes were wasted. What's important is to not have high expectations!I gave it 8/10 because despite the story being so simple and predictable that a 10-year-old could have written it, the movie was actually produced just fine. The plot was sound, the acting was fine, the action was fine. There are even a few sort-of funny moments in the film, and that was unexpected. Overall, it was a movie done just fine that it was watchable.One issue with the film is that its pace was too quick for its story. The first 25 minutes were particularly rushed. I feel this kind of story needed maybe 180mins of time to tell the story instead of 100mins. Suspense failed to build up since the monster was unleashed so soon, so pace was a definite issue for me.Another issue is the concept of having the main antagonist be a very beautiful woman. You can't build fear and suspense in the audience if the main evil in the movie is so darn beautiful. You can't take the movie seriously if the most evil thing in the movie is so beautiful. It's a new approach to the franchise, but I think it only hurt its box office success since nobody in the audience ever would feel fear or suspense.The ending was good in my opinion, and it left me very satisfied. It even left a small window for a sequel. This is a reboot after all, so who knows. Would I watch a sequel? If it's better than this one, I would.Conclusion: this is the type of movie you'd watch once in your life if you have nothing else to watch. It's definitely not the type of movie that would become your favorite and you'd re-watch several times over your lifetime. But, it was done just fine and it was watchable. Based on its low IMDb average rating you may be wondering if you should watch it: my recommendation is to watch it if you have nothing else to watch. I think you will be mostly entertained for the 100 minutes the film actually lasts. But remember, ""keep your expectations low so that you are not disappointed"".",The Mummy
222,leoxatzian,Something rotten coming this way.,4,10 February 2019,"This movie is the definition of trying to do too many things at the same time and failing. It desperately trys to set up future sequels and spin-offs while also trying to get us interested in a new shared cinematic universe before it has even began. Since the focus was on making a franchise rather than an enjoyable movie, the end result has a cliche plot, uninspired action and a protagonist so one-dimentional that even Tom Cruise's natural charisma can't make him entertaining.",The Mummy
223,boris_unanimate,Do Not Raise What Has Been Dead,4,21 August 2017,"Like many upcoming franchises, The Mummy was one that I was hoping would make a huge impact and would bring us new and exciting movies that are inspired by the classics and breathe new life into them. Tom Cruise sure sounded like someone who could get almost everybody into cinemas. So what went wrong, where did the Dark Universe train derail?Here are some of the worst things the movie wanted to get right but got entirely wrong. Tom Cruise isn't a comedic actor, nor is he someone who can improvise funny lines. He's an action star, he's pretty good at running, jumping, punching people, and an overall badass when it comes to battling evil. But he really isn't funny, especially when he's trying really hard.The plot was a trainwreck of its own. Whoever wrote the screenplay must have thought he's very original and it doesn't look like they're copying other screenplays. Well, they did and didn't. They made the entire story so convoluted and complex that the hero had to be either Superman or Doctor Strange to make sense and save the day. These screenwriters should have someone out of the industry to tell them their writing rubbish, because that's what this was, rubbish. I get that the Mummy is a supernatural being, although it was explained badly in the beginning - Brendan Fraser's Mummy wasn't only more original and better written, it was also exciting from start to finish, despite you knowing how it will ultimately end. In 2017's Mummy, you think you know how it will end, and then it doesn't, which was a nice twist but eventually it was just to set up the entire 'dark universe', but I don't think some of us want to see another fiery trainwreck. The worst thing wasn't the rubbish storyline, the badly written characters or the action almost entirely based on CGI, that wasn't really that much better than in Fraser's Mummy. It's the comedic timing and horrific jokes that fall flatter than Tom Cruise while filming stunts for the next Mission Impossible. It's not even a comparison. Fraser's Mummy was amazing, and the sequel was almost as good as the first one.The jokes were hilarious and very well placed. The jokes and comedy in this one is cringeworthy. I always looked away when Cruise tried to be funny, because it looked more like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre than a well-placed pun. Seriously, who wrote these jokes and who actually thought it was genuinely funny?That's my last point, and ultimate question - who supervises these movies, who endorses the making of 'dark' movies that try to be lighthearted and funny, but want to scare you? Either you want to make me laugh and throw in several shocking moments, or you want to scare me and sometimes relieve the tension with a joke. You can't have both. Watch Alien and Aliens - scary movies with well-placed jokes that don't make the atmosphere too light. Somebody needs to watch some quality movies and see what does well with audiences and then apply it to their next project. Otherwise you'll have another mass collision on your hands, with major casualties. The only thing really enjoyable about this movie is the pacing - not the acting (Oh Jesus Almighty, the acting was horrendous, especially when you consider the star-studded cast), not the CGI (please, don't try to make everything more amazing with CGI, just some well-done lighting and music can create a scary atmosphere and probably doesn't cost as much as all that unnecessary and stupidly looking CGI), the sometimes endless action, and definitely not the dumb story. The pacing was really well done, as most movies should do with their stories. But the pacing is the only thing that escaped unscathed, besides Tom Cruise. The guy is impossible to kill. He can survive anything. And that's what I seriously dislike in all modern movies - you can't hurt the protagonist. There are no realistic stakes in the game, the viewers know how it will end. We don't expect the protagonist and his love interest to ever be in any real danger, and that's what really makes modern movies boring. Give me something to shock me, let me question whether he can actually make it out. Tom Cruise is diving in this movie for almost 10 minutes without taking a breath, while pursued by the undead, and that really made me hate it more than anything. Except for the bad story. The story was really, really, exceptionally horrid. I can't stress it enough. It was probably worse than Troll 2. I want these movies to succeed in order to get more new cool movies. But someone up there is obviously trying to make it all fail, because there's no other explanation. You can't watch this movie and say ""Yeah, that's a good one, let's release it to the public, it will earn a billion trillion dollar."" No, it won't. Test screening should be done for people who actually enjoy movies, not housewives and moms. And reshoots are rubbish. They almost always make the movie worse. I wish BvS had been much darker, it probably would have been much better. And Suicide Squad would have been at least consistent. No more unnecessary reshoot and test screening for moms with kids that only watch daytime TV and talk shows. And invest in better screen writers, not more CGI. A good screen can make or break a movie. Watch it so you know why it sucked so horribly and why they should have at least tried to copy the Fraser one. God, I miss Brendan Fraser. He was a better Mummy opponent than Cruise will ever be.",The Mummy

A slightly CGI Mr. Hyde played by Russell Crowe with some digital enhancement. Did I mention a bunch of CGI enhancement is involved? It is to be expected in a film of this size. My question though is did this movie need to be this huge massive expensive blockbuster? In my opinion, it didn't and if it hadn't have been, it might have been successful.But I'm getting off topic here. I'm here to talk about this movie. This is three types of movies rolled into one. You have the adventure movie very similar to the 1999 Brendan Fraser Mummy film. You have the odd little horror movie with distracting CGI similar to the 1999 The Haunting. Finally you have a superhero style monster movie. I was confused through most of it.

225,anupapu8,Didn't have a Unique SOUL for a cinematic universe. Too generic.,6,10 June 2017,"THE MUMMY - I didn't slept last night , because i had to cAtch an early morning 4 30am bus for Chandigarh a 5 hr journey to watch Mummy and Wonder Woman , because these were not screening in my city. And i didn't slept the whole day. Came back to Shimla at 11pm , eat my dinner and after writing my review , i will take a peaceful NAP. It was quite an exciting and exhausting experience. The thing is that i have watched both the movies with sleepy eyes and my eyes closed numerous times while watching them specially in case of THE MUMMY because it was boring and making me even more sleepy.So UNIVERSAL is making their own cinematic universe called DARK UNIVERSE. The characters along with Mummy will be Dracula , Frankenstein , Invisible Man etc. But it has some problems. The first and basic one is that they forgot to ADD any SOUL to it. You will- never feel that you are watching a different cinematic universe. It feels like an usual Tom Cruise movie. And let me be clear - not on the level of Mission Impossible or Edge Of Tomorrow or Oblivion. Rather on the level of Jack Reacher 2 & Knight and Day. And thats bad . really bad. Because Tom Cruise doesn't make movies for Awards. He is a commercial actor who is famous for making crowed pleasure , and sustaining his star power on that. And if cant earn money with a movie like THE MUMMY , then his star power is definitely deteriorating(recently his Jack Reacher 2 flopped at box office.)Action scenes were nothing like you haven't seen already. Entertaining but not Aww-aspiring. Jokes were kind of unnecessary. The original Mummy released in 1999 was very high on Jokes. But it never bother me. Because that series has been made in such nature to make you laugh. But in here as i said UNIVERSAL is setting up a Cinematic universe and they took a very serious approach to it. Which in every context is great. But they ruined that mood with injecting mis managed jokes .The whole Comic friend/co- worker/sidekick thing was too flat. Why cant they just make up their mind with how they want to tell the story. Speaking of story the writing didn't helped much either. Universal hired some really good writers to rewrite the screenplay after the initial draft. Which makes me wonder how bad the original screenplay was if they come up with this after rewrite. Their was not much in between the action sequences to hold ur interest. I don't consider it as SPOILER still a warning - their was a scene in the trailers where they show Tom Cruise having some-kind of super power and he hold the Mummy's neck with his hands in a super-fast speed. That particular scene from the trailer , spoiled the climax for me. It made me understand what will happen at the end. And it did happened. So i found the climax to be very flat.Tom cruise like i said is a crowed pleasure. And a very good actor too. But i don't think he can elevate bad script from his charm. And thats exactly what happened here. He is good , he runs good, he fights good , he jumps good , he jokes good, but the script gave him nothing unique to do. Russel Crow , one of my most fav actor , didn't have a running time in the movie worth discussing. I only hope his character will get important with each movie. I think UNIVERSAL should stop joking around and concentrate on the Horror factor of these monsters. Last thing to add , its slightly better then Jack reacher 2 , so thats a positive thing.

It resembles a mishmash of various episodes of Tales from the Crypt, without coherence, structure, campy fun or even a few jokes here or there. The Mummy is nothing, a movie about nothing, saying nothing about nothing, not even following the timeworn, by the numbers, formulaic script of movies like Tomb Raider, which was at least watchable. It might even be the worst movie ever made; far, far worse than John Carter, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the usual suspects, simply due to its...inherent nothingness, it's unforgivable monotony, which I can only describe as the all too common dream of running from some unseen danger while one's feet sink into the ground, stuck, trapped, helpless, in this case, forced to watch the movie in its entirety, hoping beyond hope it will somehow begin to resemble the Brendan Frasier classic (which succeeded simply by copying Indiana Jones). To put this into perspective, Nicolas Cage's National Treasure is like the Godfather when compared to this purgatory piece of trash. I mean this, really. If purgatory is real, it was be a place where one is forced to watch The Mummy for eternity. I truly don't get it. I'm not a producer, director, screenwriter or actor, but I'm at least aware enough to know how to identify the basic archetypes to a watchable, if not very good movie, especially one with tons of money and famous actors at its disposal (take movies like House of Wax, The Devil's Rejects, Texas Chainsaw, Wrong turn etc.--not masterpieces, but none the less very much fun to watch, because all the ingredients are there: the mongoloid, deformed child, the horny teenagers, the hillbilly kinfolk, the crazy family of psychopaths). What is truly amazing is how the producers and writers, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, were too inept and frankly stupid to understand this very basic concept. If you don't have a great idea, it's verse chorus verse, a no brainer. It's a gripe I have for sure—following the formula to ensure the investment pays off—but in this case they not only didn't follow the formula, it is as though they researched every film that failed and combined all these into one trite, soap opera of a failed blockbuster. Even Tom Cruise surprised me, the guy's not stupid; he knows his movies are over the top, but still makes movies like Mission Impossible, which are so much fun, so much pure entertainment, to watch again and again. Did he read the script? Did he understand what he was signing up for? Was he so obsessed and enamored with the cult of Scientology he forgot to all his experience and training? On principle alone, this ""movie"" should be boycotted at all costs, if for nothing more than for the insult it presents to those who expect at least a minimal sense of escape and enjoyment from a Tom Cruise film. It's the lie that makes me so mad. And the lie is this: my hard earned cash will at least give me some bare enjoyment. And f--k Russell Crowe.",The Mummy
227,DrTuvok,"Don't play with mercury, kids",3,15 January 2021,"Early on in the Mummy, Tom Cruise is shown fiddling around with mercury, which is dripping all over the place as he enters the mummy's tomb. One gets the feeling that the people who wrote this movie and who ran the company that funded it were doing the same thing in their spare time. Or maybe the mercury was actually put in for a reason. In this movie, Tom Cruise suffers from so many hallucinations, flash-flashbacks, and violations of his mind that it would not be surprising if the whole thing was meant to be one big psychosis that came from him meddling with the stuff. Take this one scene, for instance: Cruise is being chased by the mummy and an army of rats, he is trapped in an alley with all the doors locked, the rats swarm over him, knocking him to the ground and holding him down, the mummy approaches ominously...
Cut to Cruise walking down the street with the requisite female character, wondering why it is that he can understand ancient Egyptian.
What is going on here? How can anything in this movie be considered 'thrilling' if we don't even know what's supposed to be real?The movie can't seem to decide itself. The plot ostensibly concerns Cruise, (He has a character, I think, but just acts like himself), his sidekick, and a female archeologist, who find the mummy's tomb in Iraq. They then raid it, accidentally releasing the creature out into the world, and then things stop making the remotest sense-things just happen, such as the rat scene that I mentioned. The archeologist (Annabelle Wallis) says a lot of empty words which are meant to sound knowledgeable. The sidekick, (Jake Johnson), is the comic relief who is bitten by a spider, becomes a zombie, is shot three times, and ends up as a zombie ghost who periodically haunts Cruise. ""I'm cursed!"" he whines, with all the intensity of a thirty year old finally being kicked out of his parent's basement. They are pursued by the mummy, who wants Tom Cruise's body for something. She converts many innocent people into mummy minions, and it's here that the movie's most thought-provoking question appears. What is the difference between a mummy and a zombie? This movie is supposed to be about mummies, but the mummy minions look, sound, walk, fight, and die exactly like zombies in any other movie. What sets them apart?Eventually everything converges on a monster-fighting organization, and it's here that the wanna-be franchise aspects of the film kick into high gear. The organization is run by the great Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe), and it is apparently committed to capturing evil things, studying them, and then destroying them. I'm not sure what these people expect to gain by studying the evil things, and keeping them alive at all seems like a recipe for disaster, especially if your boss has the most famous split personality on the planet.",The Mummy
228,ewaf58,What was this supposed to be?,3,27 November 2019,It started reasonably well but then descended into a mix of borrowed ideas for example - An American Werewolf in London (decomposing friend who won't leave him alone) .The acting was terrible and the whole film had an uneven tone. Was it supposed to be a comedy or a horror film?The 1999 film had the right mix of humour and thrills but our Tom just hasn't got the lightness of touch required.And on the subject if lightness of touch Tom's touch was heavy handed as it's been well documented how he took control of the film.The production clearly needed a highly experienced director to put Cruise in his place.I usually enjoy you as an actor Tom but when your interfere with the making of a film too much a Turkey like this one results. Deflate your ego a bit mate and let people do their jobs.,The Mummy
229,evan_harvey,Terrible,2,2 August 2017,"The Mummy remake is such a disaster of a movie. The writers should be ashamed on themselves. It was so muddled. Whether that was just a half-assed script or micromanaging by the studio, who cares? The end result is a waste of money, primarily mine, and a dull film.The buddy-adventure start was poorly written: US troops/mercenaries stealing relics is okay as a plot point, but Tom Cruise isn't even close to half as charming as he thinks he is, plus he and Jake Johnson just don't pull it off.Then throwing in some ham-fisted 'sexual tension' with Annabelle Wallis completely failed as well. There was just no chemistry there. In fact, if they'd used that in the plot, it would've been better. Tom Cruise can't convincing do the roughish charm that writers (or studio) was trying to get.Then having Johnson hang around wasting time as a zombie/spirit/whatever ended up just being annoying. Adding Jekyll/Hide only further muddled the plot, whilst not contributing anything of value.The rest of the movie just drags and drags, and the ending is unsatisfying. Avoid at all costs. Even if it was free, second-guess yourself and you still won't be disappointed.",The Mummy
230,jeannefrancoise,Not a really scary movie,6,7 June 2017,"The Mummy for me is like the movie of ordinary. I am used to watch movies, that is included mummy inside it, they are scary. But for this time, this movie is not like a horror, nor scary movie and I can tell you why. The first is about the title. I can imagine about the title, that is simple, straightforward, and not so surprising. The title is ""The Mummy"", so basically the mummy that will lead all the plots. In fact, you will believe me and you can write review after watching it, that the mummy is not really a central of the plots. Yet, the unnecessary appearances of the mummy, which is a lot to happen. Well, I really do not know whether the Director is really learning about Egyptian history, but the movie shows the mummy has the power somehow like a zombie. This is the weakest part of this movie. Mummy is not definitely a zombie! You can figure out also the figure of the mummy. She is not so scary, even for me, Indonesians or Thailand's ghosts are more scarier. Besides, Tom Cruise here is not playing smoothly, from beginning to the end. There is no serious talk, nor surprise scenes, nor romantic comedy, as he habitually played. The role of Russel Crow himself is also not so well. The movie can go, without the role of him. The other thing that I want to critic is about the ending. Wow, you will be disappointed. In brief, this movie is not a must-watch. This is a boring movie. You can watch later. Sorry, Tom Cruise. You can be better.",The Mummy

It can be enjoyed as a weekend watch but is definitely not a movie to be watched to study and analyze. There is no rhythm, no logic and no sense, but at least the CGI was not bad. It really felt nice to see in a big screen. The big screen being my 50 inch Android TV.But, Jake Johnson was the star of the movie. Tom Cruise is getting repetitive.

232,VinceGambini,The 5.4 rating is still way too high,2,19 August 2020,I'm not against the genre. It sure had its time. But this is 2017. You simply can't make mummy movies anymore and be taken seriously. The onslaught of CGI does not give this any credibility. It's all ridiculous. Full stop. And the terribly miscast Tom Cruise is just making things worse. This is all wrong from the get go. I'm just thinking how much money was wasted on this embarrassing disaster. Not worth anyone's time. Forgettable and that's abundantly clear after 15 min.,The Mummy
233,twpain,Not very good,4,6 June 2020,This movie just wasn't very good. The plot and execution of the film was done pretty poorly and there's not many stand out moments. At least we got to see Tom Cruise in action but in the long run this movie turns out utterly forgettable.,The Mummy
234,drawlife,Missed Brendan Fraser.,5,13 June 2017,"It's not the best sign when you miss Brendan Fraser(not hating on him, actually like some of his movies).Where to beginI watched most of the Universal Monster films from the golden age of cinema. Being born in the 90's and growing up in that era I checked them out through Blockbuster and recall being fascinated by them(Yes Blockbuster, that should give you a good idea about my age). So with that being said, I was intrigued and had high hopes for Universal's Dark Universe. Sadly, the Dark Universe is not off to a good start. This film promotes itself like a Mummy film, but it hardly has any Mummy in it, well not enough at least. It does have glimpses of potential, but it's more like a commercial for the audience to let us know that Universal has a plan for their Dark Universe. It's trying too hard to build a universe and trying way too fast. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, some of which are talented writers. Alex Kurtzman is a bit of a hit or miss a writer, but I do enjoy some of the films he has written. This is his second directorial feature and it definitely shows. While the action is decent at times, it's mostly framed up close and you don't really get to see much of it. Not to mention the dialog is also incredibly dull and choppy. Sofia Boutella, the Mummy herself starts off promising, but then it falls apart as the movie progresses. While very acrobatic, and visually looks cool, she never came off as scary or creepy like Arnold Vosloo's performance in the 1999 film. If we're comparing there are moments of Vosloo's Mummy in the 1999 film where he's used in a creepy and scary manner. She's also not as compelling as Boris Karloff. She has a set of powers, and at times they are displayed to good effect, like raising zombies from the dead, but I never felt a sense of danger or any stakes involved. That really has to do with the fact that she spends most of her time either trying to seduce Tom Cruise or being a prisoner to Russell Crowe's Henry Jekyll. The fact that this event takes place within a span of two or three days tops didn't help either. Again, if we're comparing to the 1999 and 1932 version, they felt like a long event as opposed to being quickly wrapped up here with this film.Russell Crowe is a great actor to get whenever you need exposition. He delivers them with ease and his Jekyll/Hyde moment is a highlight to me. He is like the Nick Fury of this universe as he runs an organization called Prodigium. Through him we also get a lot of reference of what is supposed to come in the future. The rest of the cast Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson are just there. Wallis plays the typical love interest also providing exposition when the film needs it. As for Johnson, it's interesting because they tried to do something unique with him, but it ends up falling flat. That has to do with the fact that no explanation is given to why his character ends up a certain way at all. Lastly, I haven't seen a movie in a while that really doesn't know what to do with Tom Cruise. This film misuses him in the worst way. His character Nick is just all over the place and one noted. Cruise's films lately showcases his ability to do action and the film does have two or three cool moments, including the scene underwater where he has to swim away from zombies, but it never really uses him to the full advantage for one big spectacle moment. The idea of a female Mummy had me intrigued. A shared universe with Universal's classic monsters had me intrigued, and with the actors that they have casted, I was all in. When I heard about this announcement, however long ago it was, I was really hoping that this wasn't just purely a cash-grab, and based on the interviews I've seen of Alex Kurtzman it seemed as if he was genuine about this project and the future. While he may have meant it, the film however is a pure example of how not to make a corporate film. Every studio has jumped the bandwagon on cinematic universes due to Marvel' success. I believe the difference is that while Marvel is corporate, they have people who care about their property and telling a good narrative. Sure they had their misfires, but they had patience and took their time with it. Universal approached it as if the audience wanted a cinematic universe for their classic monsters, but in truth(aside from me and maybe a few others), I don't think many people did. Aside from a few amusing moments and some flashes of what could be a cool universe, it's disjointed and incredibly dull. Should the Dark Universe move forward I would hope that it picks itself up properly and deliver. 5.5/10",The Mummy

236,jb07-660-944395,Where did they dig this script up from?,5,10 June 2017,"It's not so much a case of the curse of the Mummy, but more like the curse of being written and directed by the same person! Even though there are a number of credited writers, It appears the director - who also produced this film, got their way.This Mummy lacks a lot of what made Brendan Fraser's Mummy so entertaining.The script is confusing. Bringing in Mr Hyde around the middle kind of destroyed any credibility, and almost made it cringe worthy.Having Russel Crowe put on a fake, British, upper class accent just didn't work for me. His gloved hand was reminiscent of Peter Sellers' mad scientist in Dr Strangelove, and again muddied the waters - is this a horror, spoof or comedy?The special effects were good, but the rest of the movie lacked any solid foundation. The script failed to produce a creditable bond between Tom Cruise and his soldier partner from the start of the film Major spoiler follows:If Tom Cruise could easily smash the stone on the floor, thus disabling the dagger, then why didn't the Egyptians just do that, rather than hide it?Why did Tom Cruise spend most of the film trying to avoid being stabbed, and then he stabs himself in the end (of the movie)?Very poor script writing.",The Mummy

238,fdbjr,Not Seriously Intended (SPOILERS),7,10 June 2017,"I went to this movie with my stepson, intending to have a good time jeering at a bad movie. Well, we had a good time, but not in the way I thought. This is not a seriously intended movie. There's too much camp, too much comedy, too much deliberate self-parody. Midway in the picture, in what is a supposedly serious scientific office, Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe) shows up, with a lecture on 'evil' that is straight out of the Victorian era. Naturally, Mr. Hyde appears later on, with his own accent, eyes rolling, and malevolent intentions. Come on.This is a spoof. It's not as well done as it might have been, but not all that bad. Universal's Dark Universe seems to me to be looking more at Marvel Comics than DC. You could do worse. The deadly serious critics that are panning it, and some of the cineastes here, have missed the main point.",The Mummy
239,WooderIce64,A Missed Opportunity,4,20 March 2019,"This movie was intended to begin Universal's Dark Universe, a cinematic universe about all the classic monsters. In fact, Universal actually did that back in the 1930s and 40s, yet Marvel is often given the credit for the idea of a ""cinematic universe."" They did in in the past before anyone did it, and now that everyone's trying, it's a perfect time to begin their own. Unfortunately for Universal, this was the opposite of how it should have gone if they wanted to take back the idea. The Mummy is not even close to good enough to get started with a franchise. It's not the worst movie ever, and it really didn't deserve as much hate as it got, but it certainly could have been much better in just about every regard.It's easy to compare it to the Brendan Frasier Mummy trilogy, particularly the first two, as they are really two versions of the same movie. However, this version takes a much darker tone, another recent cinematic trend. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, they could've taken the straight up horror movie route, or the adventure route. They tried to do both at once, and it's a mess. It's not scary enough to be horror, and it's not that much of an adventure. This was not Tom Cruise's best performance. It was far from it. The characters, Cruise included, are completely uninteresting. Also, for a movie called ""The Mummy,"" it could have spent way more time in Egypt. It's mostly set in England. Heck, this movie spends more time in Iraq than in Egypt. That's really dumb. Mesopotamia was civilized like Egypt back then. So, did they just roll up to Hammurabi with Ahmanet's cursed mummy and say, ""mind if we bury this here?"" But I digress.It's not all bad. Russell Crowe was enjoyable as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and he was clearly having a great time portraying the character. The scenes where they hinted at the world of classic monsters wer enjoyable. The visuals were quite good, although the scene with the sandstorm in London wasn't nearly as long as advertised. Stories about cursed relics, no matter how cliché they might be, are always fun. The whole aesthetic with Ahmanet and this version of the Mummy was pretty cool. It was also cool for Ahmanet to be speaking that language. I'm not even sure what that language is, but it has some sense of authenticity to it. If you go into this movie expecting nothing more than a summer popcorn flick, you may end up enjoying it. That's all this movie is really good for. Unfortunately, it's also not as fun or as good as other versions of The Mummy, notably the 1999 version and Mummy Returns, which it's most similar to. However, the objective here was to start a cinematic universe. In that regard, it just simply doesn't work.",The Mummy

There were some established actors in this movie such as Tom, Russell, Annabelle, Sofia and Jake who did a kind of good job but it looked like a mockery of themselves to the audience.

242,eparazak,A confusing and very mediocre start to Universal's Monster Universe,3,9 June 2017,"The Mummy is a movie about an Egyptian princess named Ahmanet who became mummified after becoming an evil traitor to her country. Centuries later, she awakens with the unintentional help of an explorer named Nick alongside others named Jenny and Vail and together, they must stop this princess from wrecking havoc in the modern world.I personally was really hoping that this movie would be good because I was somewhat excited for it. Although at the same time, I wasn't sure what Universal was trying to do by creating a monster universe. Warner Bros created one and it's doing decently. All that aside, I was very disappointed by the overall result of the film.It was overall very confusing in many different ways. One of the most confusing elements has to be the fact that the movie throws way too many elements regarding the Egyptian princess and they come out of nowhere. She can attack using birds, stir up sandstorms, bring people back from the dead, turn people into zombies, etc. Many of these abilities come out of nowhere and feel very forced on us. The screenplay was also very confusing. There were many things that happen in the movie that either don't make sense or are not explained very well, such as the curse that is put on Nick after discovering the mummy. During the middle of the movie, when he and Jenny were being chased from a church, the mummy somehow redirects them from where they were going to right back to the church where she and the undead were. Did I mention that Nick could sense that they were approaching a highway?There were so many questions that I had throughout the movie that it's mind-blowing. Why was there a random sandstorm surrounding the explorers when they were about to take off and investigate the sarcophagus? Again, how could Nick sense that there was a highway? What was with those random fantasies with Vail and Ahmanet? How could the explorers' team find them near the church? Why didn't they just kill the princess when she was at a vulnerable state? What's with all these implications? Does the curse prevent death? How does being an evil monster revive someone from their death? It's crazy to see how many unanswered and occasionally answered questions I had with this movie. Just how many stones were turned in the making of this?If there's anything good I can say about this movie it's that I found the special effects to be very good and the acting was fine. Sofia Boutella gives a great performance as Ahmanet and Tom Cruise does a fairly good job as Nick Morton. My favorite scene in this movie has got to be the part where Tom Cruise ran.Either way, this is a movie that is meant to reboot the Mummy franchise and it is just terrible. If this is how Universal's new Monster Universe is going to begin, then they'd better hope they can turn this franchise around soon because it's not off to a good start.3/10",The Mummy
243,stebird,The Dark Universe crashes and burns,2,30 July 2017,"The Mummy is the first in a proposed series of films commonly being referred to as the ""Dark Universe"", and may I say if the next film is anything as bad as this one, I suggest Universal walk away from the project labelling it an unmitigated failure. From the very beginning, it reeks of ""seen-it-all-before"", the historical film just doesn't work in today's world, by that I mean think of Exodus: Gods and Kings, Noah, Gods of Egypt, the remake of Ben-Hur, and you can add The Mummy to that list now, yeah I know it's set in the present day, but it's still about Egypt and an evil Ancient Egyptian Queen.For this kind of film to be remotely successful, it needs to be more realistic, all the darkness, the Queen that is quickly reborn after centuries going around London wreaking havoc, destroying buildings just through her mere presence, it's very much like a kids cartoon, only darker..., there's nothing scary or tense about The Mummy considering it's meant to be a horror, more like a giant bore!Through my research, I have found that The Mummy is supposedly linked to the previous mummy films, yet when The Mummy, The Mummy Returns etc hit our screens, the Dark Universe hadn't even been thought of, huh?? Worse yet, it's supposedly linked to the 1930's mummy films..., seriously huh?!?! The whole Dark Universe is deemed to fail judging by the mess that is their first film, Universal Studios are simply trying to cash in on the success of the shared universe concept so many franchises have made a success of, only it's not going to work for Universal, not if this is their game!Tom Cruise is an actor who's earned my respect, the same goes for Russell Crowe, but if this is the rubbish they're both intent on making now, I'll have to reconsider the respect I gave them and maybe take it back, actors of their calibre should not be going anywhere near this kind of trash, back in the ""olden-days"" of cinema, films like these were considered B-movies, and for very good reason!My faith and pride in Hollywood has gradually been weening over the past few years, one of the reasons is through the lack of quality in their films, the topics of their films, the way films are made, the modern ways that have made tradition obsolete..., The Mummy is a perfect example of what I'm trying to put across. The one thing I did like however was Annabelle Wallis, the actress is still trying to find her feet so I'll forgive her for appearing in this one, she was trying her best bless her, even with the rubbish she was given to work with, I see a bright future for her she just needs to avoid too many blips like this one that could push her back. Jenny Halsey played by Wallis was the only character I liked and could relate with, she seemed committed and was willing to give it her best, fair play to Annabelle. Alas I won't be buzzing with excitement to watch anymore Dark Universe films I can tell you that, if the next one is as bad as this one, I'll skip the franchise altogether.",The Mummy

The only problem i found was that they tried to cover too many monsters in the one movie making it a little strange. You've got the undead minions who are the zombies. Then there's Jekyll and Hyde. The only monsters missing were werewolves and vampires. Still, the set design and the cinematography are all excellent, and the action sequences are great and there are no quick cuts or erratic camera movements.As far as Cruise's performance in The Mummy goes, he's great. It's evident that Cruise is enjoying himself immensely throughout The Mummy, and that enthusiasm really shines through in his performance.If you are expecting a Mummy movie like the old Hammer Horror movies or the Brendan Fraser ones, then you might be disappointed, otherwise there are a lot of exciting incidents in this movie, there's horror, there's jokes, and big action sequences. It looks good, it's fun, it's exciting and Tom cruise and the rest of the cast are excellent also..Conclusion- Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, if you go see it with an open mind then you will enjoy it..

If the answer is yes, good for you, you probably enjoyed the movie. 
If the answer is no, well, here is everything that is wrong with this movie. It is not entirely bad, but it lacks a compelling and believable story, it lacks believable charaters.How to makes this movie better: 
Cruises ""super funny"" mate and comic relief is not even in the movie. 
Cruise and his love interest are together for a long time, going through a rough patch lately. But as the story progresses and Cruise becomes more and more sucked into the spider web of Ahmunet, the love between the couple helps to overcome the dark strings. In the end, Cruise gives his soul heal is wife/girlfriend. The story should be about love and about the charismatic power of a dark soul, Cruise being torn between both of them.

But Cruise has never been lovable, he's just annoying. So he is miscast here. Cruise has not one, but two (annoying) side kicks! His clunky banter with both falls flat EVERY TIME. This isn't just because of the cheesy script, better actors can pull that off. The movie copies other movies but badly, why steal if you're making your movie even worse? Then there is the villainess, who gave out a reasonably erotic vibe, in chain bondage, but, like the side kicks, she had no rapport with Cruise. So his scenes with her fell flat too. Besides, who wants to see a muscly bloke beat up a psychologically damaged lady in a movie? She came over as a pathetic teen than dreadful evil. It seems to me Hollywood is incapable of making movies for westerners anymore. Perhapse this movie was made to appeal to the Chinese, who own much of Hollywood these days apparently.",The Mummy
250,spmact,The hate is undeserved,7,2 September 2017,"Based on all the bad reviews I was worried this would suck, but I have to say that while it wasn't as good/charming as the 90s mummy movie, it wasn't bad either. Cruise's character was likable, and while his arc wasn't that deep, it didn't really need to be. The mummy actress impressed me more than I expected, since I didn't really like her that much in Kingsman. People said that this spent too much time setting up the following movies, but I didn't think that was the case. There were small seeds planted, but save for the ending and lack of background for Jekyll, this felt self contained enough. Overall the movie had some fun action sequences and decent characters, and made for an enjoyable popcorn flick. I do not regret watching it.",The Mummy

252,StregaAsuka,Mission Impossible: Dark Mummy Disappointment,5,27 August 2017,"First of all, this was supposed to be a movie about a mummy. Kind of the one we had back in 1999 (a masterpiece by the way), but sadly we find ourselves in front of the new mission impossible movie. Where the main star is Tom and the rest of things are mere decorations.This movie faces a big issue: its plot. As per the promotions we saw, it kind of looked like the story was going to be like in the 00s movies. They find a mummy. The mummy awakes. And hell hath no fury. But what happens here is: They find a mummy. The mummy awakes. And then we no longer now if we are in a story of Egyptian mummies or about Black Lagoon Things. The characters are not well-developed. They are flat characters that no one will feel connected at all and they don't seem to move forward through the film. Plus the story also moves too fast; there isn't any deep story or anything interesting for the audience, just plain action and silly dialogues.The story looked promising at first. At least for the first 5 min until the appearance of the female character. No I am not talking about the mummy but about a kind of Lara Croft that suddenly appears and never leaves and who, by the way, is playing the though one but is just a useless damsel in distress. So we could have managed without her in here. Then there is a big problem: Tom Cruise's character. It looked like they wanted to make a modern Rick O'Connell version but it became agent Ethan Hunt and remember, this is not a Mission Impossible movie, but a mummy one!!!The whole action and whole story is focused on him and at some point we really don't care at all about him. We just want to see the bad-ass mummy in action. Sadly, the best performance of the movie, that would be the mummy from the tittle, almost doesn't happen. We get to see a bit of her and a bit of action, or shall I say more horror than action, as they wanted to recover the spirit of the original movie. But it wasn't enough. This is just a way to create a character and kill it before it even was born. Really a pity. They also introduce Dr Jekyll's character preparing it for future movies of this ""Dark Universe"" as they call it, but it doesn't look like we will be much interested at him in the future.The only good thing about The Mummy is the mummy herself. If you watch the trailer below you will already now what happens through most the movie, so don't waste your time nor your money.",The Mummy
253,e-m-hobo,He had it coming...,10,25 February 2021,"Well, why not make an honest movie with honest characters? The main character, a self-righteous prick opportunist treasure hunter pretend to be an archaeologist with the tiniest grain of feeling and soul in him ends up unleashing a curse on himself.Yup, he had it coming, and like the dog of a man he is he ends up regretting his mistake and fights to evade the inevitable while turning from the accidental role of a savior to something beyond his control hoping to save even more, but it isn't all too clear whether doom be headed his way, our way, or any other way.I really, really enjoyed this movie. It's set in another universe than the other Mummy-movies that either some journalists or the marketing bureau wrongfully identified as it being a remake thereof. It's set in the Dark Universe, which I thought was a comic book aficionado brand and term for spoils of rot and filth covered monsters and blood, which is partially correct, but it's not a comic but movie franchise.Put that in an entertaining package with plenty of grit and only sensible humor rather than the over-the-top every line has to be a pun Hollywood humor some turn to, and you have this movie.

256,velvoofell,"I Don't want ""good looking monsters""",1,21 June 2017,"We can blame the Marvel Universe. Stan Lee did crib most of his heroes by inverting classic Gothic and Universal Monsters (Frankenstein plus Dr Jekyll is Hulk, Doctor Strange is Dracula, Iron Man is every Mad Scientist in a robot suit and Spider-Man/Ant-Man every bug-man sci-fi horror as a hero)So, Universal Studios imagined, with not an ounce of respect for the paunchy, weirdly accented and only-a-mother-could-love faces that made their Universal Monsters a hit in and out of make-up, that their monsters could be heroes too. This film is meant to be the first in this ""Dark Universe"". 'The Mummy' tries to have its cake and eat it. Never mind the fact that the charisma vacuum of Tom Cruise is the star, his every cgi-tornado-framed grimace making us yearn for Harrison Ford; slickness was never the word associated with Universal monsters. Action fans are going to be bored or confused, the poor petals. Horror fans will laugh at the latest first-year art student photo-shop collage brought to life and called a ""monster"". At least Sommers had tongue in cheek and an eye for the outrageous. At least his Mummy and Van Helsing films entertained. Not much can save this film from being yet another Tom Cruise vanity project. To add insult to injury, he already played a vampire in a monster movie that had heart, soul and blood. This lifeless thing will remain that way.Come back Jack Pierce, all is forgiven.",The Mummy

It worked with goof-ball Brendan Fraser, it doesn't work here.Like most people, I was acutely drawn in by the expertly crafted trailer which meant to present the movie as a serious piece of fantasy.It isn't.What we get is a complete train wreck of a movie that is nearly impossible to follow.The only things young girls will find enjoyable is Tom is probably the fittest man in Hollywood for being in his 50's, and the only thing I found was the Queen is pretty cute.That's about it.",The Mummy

261,Blazehgehg,Did not get its hooks in to me,3,18 July 2017,"Don't watch this version of The Mummy.It wants Tom Cruise to look like a scoundrel with a heart of gold, like Nathan Drake or Han Solo or what-have-you, but instead of straddling the line between likable and gross, he's just all the way gross. A greedy, selfish, destructive, slimy character. Every bad quality of his archetype but none of the good. How are you supposed to root for this guy to succeed?The movie has serious tone problems, whipping between excessive Michael-Bay-style chaos, spooky zombie horror, and... comedy? What? The dialog here isn't even necessarily what's funny, either; in fact, most of the banter between characters feels more desperate in an obnoxious way. Instead, the movie has a number of slapstick gags, and not all of them feel entirely intentional. At one point Tom Cruise gets flat-out uppercut 20 feet in to the air, Mortal Kombat style, and it made me burst out laughing. I'm not sure I was supposed to; it's hard to tell if it was meant to be intentionally funny, or if they were trying to make a monster look powerful only for it to read as cartoonish.The hooks in to their proposed ""Dark Universe"" are transparent and bad. The movie's plot is already kind of thin, with the titular Mummy herself spending most of the narrative making Tom Cruise hallucinate unthreatening nonsense, yet the middle of the movie wastes time on a big bloated crossover detour so they can hint at all the other movies they were planning for this franchise. Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time to talk about his secret society of monster hunters and ""curing evil"" that ends up giving The Mummy an awful sort of Super Hero Origin Story feel to it. Tired of those? You'll be tired of this. It eats up a good 15 minutes (or more) and poisons a movie that could have used that time to better tell its own story.Another unintentional laugh came when Russell Crowe, with salt and pepper gray hair, unironically calls Tom Cruise a ""young man."" Cruise is actually older that Crowe, but his character is still written like he's in his 20's or early 30's. Cruise himself is roughly more than twice that age. Ouch.The end result is flimsy and messy at best. The final moments before the credits roll may as well be somebody winking directly in to the camera saying ""We have six more of these planned. See you soon!""No, probably not.",The Mummy

264,taryllsbaker,"""Sofia Boutella stands out in the unfortunate first entry to the Dark Universe.""",4,14 June 2017,"The Mummy is directed by Alex Kurtzman and stars Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe, Annabelle Wallis, Sofia Boutella, Jake Johnson and Courtney B. Vance.An ancient princess is awakened from her crypt beneath the desert, bringing with her malevolence grown over millennia, and terrors that defy human comprehension. (15 cert; 110 mins)When a studio such as Universal plans to kick-off a new Dark Universe, revisiting the classic monsters and gods, you'd expect the introduction to be a powerful and intense experience. With Alex Kurtzman's The Mummy, all we're given is the foundation for future instalments. It's unfortunate to say that; although featuring some great talent and awesome effects, this film is rather boring.Firstly, Sofia Boutella owns this role. She is Ahmanet. With previous work she has proved to be a great talent, grasping each character and delivering the very best. Her most predominant role – Jaylah in last year's Star Trek Beyond – was one of my favourite film characters from 2016. Here, she is criminally underused. That said, every scene she features in is improved tenfold.Tom Cruise plays Nick Morton; a private contractor who was resurrected by Ahmanet after dying in a plane crash. He performs well, providing brilliant stunt work in top-notch action sequences. However, some of his scenes feel mildly inappropriate and the comedic one-liners become tiresome and outright distracting. Annabelle Wallis presents a suitably average act as Jenny, who is essentially a love-interest for Nick. It's interesting that I left the cinema having only rooted for the villain. None of the characters are as exciting as Boutella's Ahmanet.The make-up department have done some excellent work here; Boutella looks stunning yet fierce as the Mummy. She adapts to the costume and truly becomes the character, and it's clear throughout her performance. All of the sets and locations are fitting enough and although filled with corpses, they're visually full of life.Director Alex Kurtzman fails to engross viewers, mainly due to a poor screenplay and uneventful story. Nothing feels emotionally weighted, there's very little to care for when watching this film. The final act is the greatest moment, but inadequately executed. It ultimately becomes the set-up for future instalments in the Dark Universe and nothing more, which is a shame.Brian Tyler delves into the world of The Mummy by writing over 2 hours of haunting original music – some of which doesn't make it into the film – but it's all very intense. The main theme that plays over the discovery of Ahmanet is beautiful, but there's a darkness lurking underneath that evolves as the film progresses. I recommend buying the full soundtrack and listening through every piece, it's a brilliant score. Brian deserved a better film, but at least his art was something to take away from it.Verdict; Kurtzman's The Mummy is a disappointing start to Universal's Dark Universe, and though Boutella's intricate performance and Tyler's textured score are both wonderful, it's not enough to keep the film's corpse from rotting.The Mummy – ★★ (4/10)",The Mummy

Bad directing, bad acting, and just a bunch of random scenes loosely tied together. Tom Cruise, not that he';s a great actor, but he usually tries to put some fun into it, just walks his way through this one. Looked like a lot of first takes and move on lines from what you see. He has no chemistry with the mummy or the female lead, and they never explore his thief/sneaky side enough to make you feel he is trying to redeem himself at the end. The scenes with Jake Johnson as his comic relief side kick, fail badly. So here are the list of things they never really explain in the plot, and these are big plot devices!1) what's so special about mercury 2) what's so special about the ""chosen one"" 3) how come Jake Johnson's character just disappears half way through the movie and then shows up at the end. 4) what does Tom Cruise becomeor maybe the movie was so bad I didn't pay attention enough to find out.

Last month , universal studios announced that they are going to make reboots for all monster movies and put them under one universe , titled "" the dark universe "" and the mummy is the first in the franchise. So , Tom cruise is still running away from explosions and he's the only good thing about this movie. The supporting characters in this movie have no role and most of em turn into zombies . This movie has a really bad screenplay and there are way too many cuts . The mummy in this movie is a woman and she wasn't that scary either except for a few jump scares. Russell crow is in this movie and he's the nick fury of this universe . The action wasn't that good either , just too many explosions and cuts. So in the end , mummy is a bad reboot with tom cruise in it. In short , its one of those movies which premieres on HBO saying ""blockbuster of the year"" when its clearly not.",The Mummy
269,verminhater,A long trailer for future films - also where's the hero?,5,23 July 2017,"Most films these days contain at least one character you cheer onward. Not so in this film. The bad guy (girl - the mummy) is very obviously bad and the supporting characters around Tom Cruise are also bad whilst purporting to be good. Cruise himself is not a good guy either. He plays a rather reprehensible character in place of the traditional good guy.This leaves you wondering just who to cheer for. For the bulk of the film I wanted the mummy to come out tops as she at least wasn't trying to be anything she wasn't. Alas it wasn't to be so and the ending is nothing more than a set up for future films making this a very long trailer for films not yet made let alone released. Perhaps the idea was to have Mr Cruise find redemption at the end but his last actions, whilst of a good nature, show no such redemption of the character at all.One fail of note with the film - a major aircraft crash site would have hundreds of emergency services personnel in attendance not the minor handful the budget / script here allowed for. I'd suggest paying the major star a little less to allow a few extra extras to be hired would work wonders. This stood out like a sore thumb to me.All in somewhat unsatisfying as a film though nowhere near as bad as some other reviewers would have you believe.",The Mummy
270,moviesmaniax,Not a bad start for Universal's Dark Universal franchise // INSTAGRAM: MOVIESMANIAC,7,15 June 2017,"Judging from the trailers, the actual movie here isn't that bad at all. The Mummy has more than meet the eyes and I must say it does a decent job in reviving this classic monster and setting itself up for Universal's Dark Universe franchise. Still, this is a blockbuster film that duplicates much of the story, concept, and action sequences from the 1999 version, and of course, expect a stack of clichés as the story goes. Aside from that, the CGI here are not as overflooded as the trailer might suggest it to be, with enough gleefully creepy practical effects and campy fun actions to keep this movie alive enough til the end. Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe here also bring in enough likability to their characters which hint a promising expansion of their characters in a future franchise. Overall, while the film may sacrifice its effort to bring something entirely new to the table, but instead, duplicate most of what the 1999 version already did, The Mummy still has enough strong cast, captivating characters, and some campy mummy fun that result in a decent set up for a possibly greater franchise in the future.>>B-<< TWITTER: @moviesmaniaCX",The Mummy

272,Eric266,"A Lot of Potential, but Misfires",6,27 November 2019,"I'm not much of a theater goer so I usually wait for most movies to show up on television. This is one of those. I heard all the negative press and read the bad reviews...but its actually a nice little film, albeit flawed.I've never been a huge fan of Cruise's, but he does do some nice work in the action genre. The Mummy is no exception. The special effects are dazzling, the plot moves along pretty briskly, and the scenery is eerie, creepy and well used. Where the movie falters, IMO, is its attempt to not be a Mummy movie while being a Mummy movie. The Brendon Fraser-led Mummy movies had a time and space about them. They paid homage to Indiana Jones as well as the old RKO adventure movies like King Solomon's Mines. This Mummy movie is set in the present and it lacks any real feel for the genre. It does have creepy moments and a globe trotting feel ALA Indiana Jones, but it never quite rises above the fact its trying to build a universe that doesn't actually exist. I would have been interested to see how they created the Monster Universe because it has so much potential, but the film is a let down in that I never got the feeling Cruise was playing anyone other then Cruise and the same could be said for Crowe.The Mummy character as played by the lovely Sophia Boutella was wasted as well. The female character of Anck Su Namon from the 1999 version had more depth and presence than this character. Its a shame because Boutella was so good in the Kingsman film emoting with just her eyes and walk. I blame the director more than the actress.The bright spots among the cast were Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson. Wallis could have been a one-dimensional damsel in distress, but she comports herself well and creates a well-defined, kick-ass character. Johnson is hilarious as Cruise' buddy. He comes across as both sardonic and creepy. Both made the movie above average for me.I'm sad to hear they have shelved the universe idea. I really enjoyed the old movies from the 1930s in my youth. It would have been fun to see how they would have meshed them. Sadly, it doesn't look like it will happen.",The Mummy

Honestly I would prefer a horror movie with action elements instead this action flick with some horror elements, I think won't be memorable like The Mummy (1999) with Brandon Fraser as the main character, but it's a good and fine start to Dark Universe.Rating: 7.5/10Sorry my English grammar because I'm Portuguese.",The Mummy

There is clearly supposed to be a sequel, but we all know that this is based upon good box office, and well, that is somewhat weird as fr as how they now deem that a success. I guess 50 million in profit world wide is chump change to these people. One thing is clear as always. If your going to do another in the same genre, you better get more than 15 years over the deal, so its new in people's minds. Anyone with any commons sense at all would know this. And to spend 327 million on it, is beyond insanity. Unfortunately, audiences that liked it will be deprived of one by such short sightedness. As well as the critics weird dislike of Cruise. Personal dislike of an actor in real life, regardless of how uncouth it is, or in speculation of motivations in production, has NOTHING to do with a movie. To me, the story is everything, and its a good one, with effects that merely emphasize it, which is always my criteria in whether a movie is good or not. Sofia Boutella is riveting in this role, especially in the way her unconventional beauty is emphasized by her extreme talent. Its her and Eva Green, who are at the forefront of this type of great young actress of the future. There is no prejudice here. I rate it as I see it, and not with any preconceived notions.

Overall The Mummy is an alright action thriller film filled with action, violence, mummy zombies, fast paced stuff, shooting, explosions, air jets, big airplanes, poisionous like spiders and crows, chases on foot and in vehicles like cars and ambulances, turbulent winds, powerful stuff, murders, flashbacks, signs of concussions, things that seem deceiving, fall outs, arguments, team work, a race against time, the battle between good and evil to save the planet Earth, on the edge of your seat stuff, bizarre stuff, some close shaves, devastation, chaos, carnage, things, buildings getting wrecked and destroyed, stunning scenery, the pyramids of Egypt, sand dunes, big mountains and other things throughout the film.So I will give The Mummy an overall rating of 2 out of 5 stars and it's not as good as the previous Mummy films from 1999, 2001 and 2008 and it's similar to the previous Mummy films, World War Z. So you can pick and choose whether you want to go and see The Mummy at the cinema or not since many film critics haven't gave The Mummy great film reviews and good film ratings.",The Mummy
281,Zingbot_9000,The Definition of Average Movie,4,12 June 2017,"It kept me entertained for the most part, but in the end I felt like it was missing something. First off, people love to bash Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise is fine. If you like Tom Cruise he is Tom Cruise, if you don't like him do us all a favor and stay home. The inevitable is to compare this movie to the Brandon Frasor movies. I think that the Brandon Frasor movies were better.Here is what I did not like.  A Mummy movie needs to take place in Egypt. This movie mostly takes part in London.  Russell's Crowe's character was a mess. From my understanding Dr Jeckyl was the nice guy and Mr Hyde was the bad guy. Really both are bad guys in this, Mr Hyde is just Dr Jeckyl amped up on Red Bull. It's like Mr Hyde needs a Snickers. And as for Mr Hyde, I am not sure if he appears in this movie or not. Like I said Dr Jeckyl is Mr Hyde. Their appearance isn't all that different. Mr Hyde is really Dr Jeckyl with some visible veins and longer finger nails. I wonder if Mr Hyde is given his serum before he actually turns int Mr Hyde...we do not really know but if he never turns into Hyde...this is another disappointment. I was expecting to see something to the extent of even Michael Jackson's monster in Thriller (when he turns into the werewolf), but nope you get a monster that looks just like Russell Crowe. I am not sure if they are saving the real Mr Hyde for a next movie, but honestly they lost me with this one. Another thing, the movie cashes in on The Walking Dead. They were like Hmmm, Zombies are popular. Let's have some Zombies. The Movie takes itself too seriously As for the ending, what does it all really mean? How does this movie set up the Monster's Universe? Is Tom Cruise supposed to be the Mummy? But he was never a Mummy? So now the Mummy has a super power to raise people from the dead? What did I just watch? I am not sure it sets up anything? Does this movie just set up Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde? Tom Cruise is now a God, but a monster? What Monster is he? Kind of a mess if you ask me. Overall the movie kept me entertained, but I can tell you I really don't care to see the next one. All this movie did was make me feel like going back and watching the Brandon Frasor movies and showcase Tom Cruise.",The Mummy
282,cliff_bd,Better than the negative reviewers would have you believe...,7,10 June 2017,"***Some Spoilers*** I am really starting to think there is a culture of copy cat and jumping on the bandwagon within the IMDb reviewing community.Looking through the Mummy reviews, there are too many similar negative reviews When in fact the Mummy is a good movie.... but obviously it has its issues.In a similar but opposite trend, looking through the Wonder Women review, there are too many similar and hyped up glowing reviews of how fantastic the movie is - when in fact the movie is just ""good"" with too few stand out moments and too many slow and tedious moments.The Mummy did kept my attention, interest and in parts made me laugh and when I left the movie theater, I felt happy that I had paid to see a ""good"" movie and I had been entertained.Is the movie perfect? No - but it is a good movie and is so much better than the Stephem Sommers Mummy movies.I am looking forward to the next dark universe movies",The Mummy
283,mmillington554,Another pointless remake,1,17 July 2017,"Why is Hollywood so obsessed with remakes? Presumably because no-one comes up with original ideas any more...or could it be that it's safer profit-wise to hang onto a winning formula?The Mummy was a winning formula. Unfortunately, that winning formula was thrown away somewhere in this awful film. How such a strong plot with interesting characters has managed to turn itself into unwatchable trash is a feat that only Hollywood with the aid of some highly over-rated actors could accomplish.Let's name names. The real fault with the film was that it turned a supernatural, monster movie into an action adventure. This was presumably to accommodate the acting ""talents"" of Tom Cruise. Each Cruise film seems to be built around him. Presumably because he can't really act. He only seems to be comfortable when looking into the camera for a close up or saving the rest of humanity from disaster through some special effect super-human feats. If you value your time you will give this a miss. Re-watching earlier versions of The Mummy would have been much more rewarding.",The Mummy
284,Thekeybaldemasterrises,What a disaster.. The 1999 remake is a masterpiece in comparison.,3,13 August 2017,"I have no idea why Tom Cruise or Universal would even consider taking on this reboot under someone like Alex Kurtzman. This movie was dead on arrival with Alex Kurtzman directing. Kurtzman has no interest in telling a meaningful story but to show spectacle and try to distract you with big action set pieces. He killed Transformers with Revenge of the Fallen, and Garfield's Amazing Spider-Man 2. Universal sounds like they made this up as they went along because they know they can't rely on Fast and the Furious or Jurassic World forever. If this Dark Universe is really happening get a better director Kurtzman is just not gonna cut it. The thing this movie is severely lacking is fun. You can trash the Brendan Fraser films but for what they are, they were fun campy movies and I'd rather throw those on again. I realized that Cruise was originally offered to play Iron Man and then turned it down. Was this his hope that he would have something like what Robert Downey Jr has with Marvel? This movie had huge tone inconsistencies, it didn't know if it wanted to be funny or scary. It failed at being both. I saw this movie for free and I still want my time back. If you don't want the Dark Universe to happen stay FAR AWAY from the next one. But China has made it a success so I guess that just shows who the audience these movies are for will be going forward.",The Mummy
285,gdeangel,Gender script-flipped stalker film,4,18 March 2018,"We are all familiar with the stalker film: Michaeal Myers perpetually trudging after Jamie Lee Curtis. Xeonmorphs popping out of shadows to take a bite of Sigorney Weaver. Arnold's cyborg terminator racing after Linda Hamilton with a tractor trailer. Stalker films work when they present a weak and/or vulnerable protagonist who the audience desperately hopes can escape their ""fate"". Typically this requires either (1) a weak female (or child) under protection of an alpha-hero who stands between them and their doom or (2) a weak character who undergoes a transformation to become her own bad-ass wrecking crew in the final scene. But 21st century Hollywood is out to prove that all character roles are open for any gender (or race). There is no doubt that thinking inspired 2017's The Mummy. ""Let's make a Mummy stalker movie with a female mummy stalking a dude, and, like, we can even get a blonde chick to play the dude's protector!"" Then, from the someone else sitting around the conference table: ""It's an undead mummy so we can throw in lot's of zombie's too.... yes, Walking Dead!The resulting train wreck of a film might have worked with a comedic buffoon Jerry Lewis / Lou Costello type being stalked by a mummy, but to get a actor to pull it off playing straight-man was beyond acting chops of Tom Cruise -- who incidentally, despite his diminutive height, is big on playing up his physique. Face it, the guy has a lifetime of man-of-action hero's under his belt... nobody buys him get walloped by a 110# girl.As for his female protector... the writing tip-toes back and forth about what her role really is. At one point she's kicking but trying to break Cruise out of confinement. A few minutes later she is hysterically running away from danger. Ultimately -- I suspect in an ending re-write -- she ends up needing to be saved by Cruise. When everything is said and done, the studio expected to get away with a ""Transformers"" caliber story full of crappy plot holes and poorly defined character roles because... zombies I guess. Zombies are HOT now and robots are not, right? One of the most annoying thing with this film was the lazy use of zombies to direct the plot. When the mummy needs to win, there are 1000 zombies at her disposal. When she is supposed to lose, there are a few who fall like dominoes. Visually the zombies are far below the visual effects standard set by ""Haunted Mansion"" in 2003. That comparison begs the question -- what would this film have been like with Eddie Murphy playing the lead? or Chris Tucker? or better yet, Jackie Chan. Frankly, I think it would have worked a lot better with some of that slapstick comedy because, despite what the gender studies experts have ""proven"", even women don't enjoy watching Ethan Hunt / Jack Reacher run away from the undead like a scared little girl.",The Mummy

I think the critics and fans of the previous films are really wrong for rejecting this movie which is a reboot of the 1930's classic and it's more entertaining and has a better story line that takes place in the present. Props to Tom Cruise for choosing to do a horror movie after Interview with Vampire, he always gives 100 percent and does his own stunts at 55 unlike Brendan Fraser. Haters are going to hate because they're ignorant and don't appreciate a cool popcorn movie. Watch this sublime movie because you'll have fun and I can't wait to own the Blu Ray and DVD.",The Mummy

The story is stupid and ridiculous and the whole lab of the character played by Russell Crowe is a stupid twist. And I do not understand why he is injecting himself but maybe I fell asleep. Whatever you do: do not pay any money to watch this terrible movie and I only give it a five because of the special effects....",The Mummy
291,MichaelNontonMulu,Not what you expected of the Mummy movie,6,8 June 2017,"When I read that they are doing a reboot of the popular Mummy movies (which I totally loved the first one and enjoyed the second one), I was truly excited. I know that Brendan Fraser might not be the best option of doing the movie again, and I was of course psyched by the fact it would be played by Tom Cruise who was still in prime condition to play action movie. But it appeared that the movie became totally something different. this one felt too much altered.After reading some more information of the movie, I realized that this was supposed to be the start of something called Dark Universe where they would share with monsters in other universe in the future. I for one felt that the introduction towards the universe was a little bit too much emphasized. As we were hoping for a movie focusing on the Mummy, the part of the universe became a less pleasant surprise. My personal opinion is that it would probably be a lot better had it been done the way the shared universe was introduced in Kong: Skull Island, which was done in the post credit scene and hence the focus of the movie was still about King Kong.Do not get me wrong though, the movie did provide us a lot of entertaining and intense scenes. My wife literally screamed in some scenes that gave us shocking moments. What I do not like was once again the trailer of the movie revealed too much information, even the surprising scenes were shown as well which totally reduced the element of surprise when we see the actual movie. Another thing, this movie did not have any post credit scene at all despite my hope there would be one. I guess whatever they wanted to highlight, in future movies were already mentioned before the end credit scene.Coming to other aspects of the movie, the special effects of the mummy was great, the CGI was cool, the sound effects were nice (I saw this in studio with Auro 11.1 system). Jenny's character in here seemed to be too stiff and felt like a person with no expression and unfortunately did not seem to have believable chemistry with Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise was pretty good in the action scenes and also quite charming (though I still think Brendan Fraser was more suitable in this role). Sofia Boutella was pretty convincing as Ahmanet, Russel Crowe was cool as ever and my personal favorite character was Vail played by Jake Johnson, who provided the much needed humor.So all in all, if you are looking for an entertaining action adventure movie, this one was a good choice. But if you are hoping for a real movie about Mummy, then it would be best to watch the original 1999 version. Oh ya, you also need to keep an open mind if you want to enjoy this movie, especially about the Dark Universe. And if you have not watched the trailer to the movie at all, then please do not do it so you can enjoy the movie better.

293,cjs6547,Makes the 1999 version look like a masterpiece,3,26 August 2017,"It's impossible to be called the Mummy, be about a resurrected Mummy out for revenge, and not evoke the memory of the 1999 Mummy movie. That movie was undeniably classic, and while it did have some clichés, it looks f**king grand compared to this.None of the characters in this are likable, except for Tom Cruise (note I say Tom Cruise and NOT his character name). Nearly all characters in the old movie were likable, even the thief who gets a scarab under his skin and the sidekick who turns out to be a turd at the end.The mummy is stupid. Imhotep was cursed for doing crazy dark magic because he was in love. This woman wanted her baby brother dead. I'm sure many actual heirs managed that irl without killing the entire family or calling forth the God of death. She has a weakness to mercury, and she can't turn into sand at will. Plus no flesh-eating scarabs were poured in her sarcophagus. Unforgivable.The chemistry between Tom and the blonde girl is worse than the chemistry between Evelyn and Imhotep. Cinema these days has just given up on romance. Yeah they've got no clue. So, they've banged and he saved her life, that's love true enough to give him the crazy-grief-rage right? Who cares if they don't bicker or pull adorable faces at each other, we don't have time for that in our 2 hour movie.The heroine works for a business that works to destroy evil. How is that a business? Who's paying them? It's not a business if its only operating on tax-payer money now. Did you instead mean to say that there's an 'evil police' in this universe? You can't throw these terms around lightly and not expect us to get distracted.Overall it tries to be too many things but just ends up being Tom Cruise trying to be Tom Cruise at whatever age he's at.",The Mummy

It's difficult not to think and compare this movie with the mummy trilogy (Brendan Fraser): Same name, similar story, same ambient, same kind of action combined with comedy. But this one is much worse. It's even boring and ludicrous at some parts. Overall, it entertains a little bit, but it could be much, much better - maybe if the plot was better or the main actor was another, other than Tom, who knows...",The Mummy
295,rebeccalucy,Underwhelming!,3,31 October 2017,"Kinda underwhelming, thought it would be a lot better. Some good things first, like the effect of the eyes of the main villain was really cool! The two pupils were unique and never seen an effect like it. Some of the mummies moved quite unnervingly, with their bodies twisting and cracking. The plane stunt was very good, a fast paced action scene.My main issue was the villain! I thought she may be a great, powerful antagonist, they were setting that up in the beginning. But gradually she becomes another woman obsessed with the main character, what a waste. The film as a whole presents women very stereotypically, either in love with the main character or a uninteresting villain.The cinematography is awful, like the overall dullness of the film. Not many nice shots or editing, most of them were a very dull grey and boring. The scenes in the desert looked a little nice though. Most of the CGI is rubbish or barely passable.

296,rblenheim,A bomb of magisterial proportions!,1,17 March 2018,"Rarely do I see a clear 'winner' of 'the worst film of the year' because I manage to avoid so many beforehand. However 2017 brought us a film worthy of that 'honor': It's the new ""Mummy"" rehash with Tom Cruise -- the most incompetent, mindless, brain-numbingly god-awful pretense of a movie experience I have seen in a decade or more. Directed as if he didn't even know what his own film was about, Alex Kurtzman has set a new standard of pointless action nonsense, attaining not a single minute of interest as frenzied drug-induced creatures dart into the camera like jack-in-the-box zombies while a bored-silly Sofia Boutella plays a third-rate Cleopatra turned goth. All the filmmakers connected with this turkey should be permanently sealed in a mummy case, or just have to sit through this film even once, a worse punishment. Here is a true story: as the end credits of this smelleroo began to crawl up the screen, I actually stood up, faced the audience, and shouted out in anger, ""This is by far the biggest piece of (expletive) I have seen in a movie theater in years!"" No one dissented and a few applauded. Do you know how bad a film has to be for me, usually a somewhat gentle soul, to resort to something like this in public? I could go on and on about how rotten this celluloid piece of baloney was, but why? This would just waste your time and mine. But maybe the saddest thing about this moronic ""Mummy"" was Russell Crowe posturing some silly Jekyll and Hyde caricature without an ounce of sincerity or credibility, evincing an embarrassed expression on his face as if he didn't want to be recognized. Considering his beyond-awful performance here (as well as his Javert in the elephantine stinker of 2012, ""Les Miserables""), this once great actor seems to have made a decision to gut his entire career. What's next on Crowe's filmography: an amateur nudie flick? But take it from me; this stinker gives new meaning to the Curse of the Pharaohs. Avoid this bomb as you would the flu.",The Mummy
297,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Mediocre Mess,5,28 November 2017,"The Mummy is a reboot of the 1999 film. Just to confuse you, It starts off with three openings; First in Medieval England; Then current day and then ancient Egypt. Sofia Boutella should be the main attraction as the mummy, but she is only down played by Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe. According to reports Cruise had excessive control over the film and nearly every aspect of production including re-writing the script, taking charge of directing and editing. It is sloppy, has an incoherent plot, inconsistent tone and shoehorned plot points setting up future instalments to the Dark Universe. It looses any credibility as its own film, it just feels like an advertisement/tease for other instalments. The Mummy is a mediocre reboot that no one asked for, with barely any character development, no chemistry between any of the actors and sub par performances, there just isn't a moment that stands out as good. The plane crash scene isn't bad since it was filmed in zero gravity, but that's all really. Even so, it could have been done in a studio with wires which we wouldn't have even noticed. Its just a vanity project for Tom Cruise to show off his dedication to performing his own stunts.

All hopes were lost when the trailer was out and what a wonderful movie it could have been! With two powerful actors Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, this movie falls just short in being a sharknado without the intention on being one! I still had hopes during various parts of the movie.

Russel Crowe, Yay...Dr.Jekyll,Yay...but wait you swapped his role from being hideous with an overweight McDonalds customer asking to choose his happy meal toy!? The CGI was very impressive - all cast in the movie were CGI which looked sooooo real, the soundtrack reminded me of 1 million action movies which releases every year made in Hollywood for audiences abroad, Tom Cruise's acting moment was when he flies around inside a jet about to crash..it was more like an extended cut with CTRL+C and CTRL+V. I can say in a heartbeat that this is definitely my favorite movie this year, OK that was just gas on my chest...Nevermind - Don't you ever consider watching this, the movie will suck your happiness like a demontor with Tom Cruise like cute face.Annabelle wallis is cute, so 2 stars.",The Mummy
300,Essex_Rider,What a pile of pooh,2,7 October 2017,"What can I say? This is clearly an amalgamation of movies written by a committee of millennial kids with zero writing talent. They must have drawn from every scary movie they ever viewed. We have his friend, Chris Vail played by Jake Johnson as the recently dead and mildly comical ghost following him around as in 'An American Werewolf in London'. We have Jekyll & Hyde where that usually most able of actors uses his native Australian accent for the evil Mr Hyde and his elder statesman come Jack Aubrey (Master & Commander)voice for the reasonable and good Dr Jekyll. We saw the ludicrous scene where Tom Cruise towers over the very lovely Sofia Boutella, (hard not to giggle at that one) in their desert scene back in time. We had rip offs from the Brenden Frazer 'Mummy' movie and let's not forget the mercury scene. The committee who wrote this clearly have no knowledge of chemical physics, if that sarcophagus was full of mercury, it would have taken a crane to lift it out. I've given it a 2 instead of a 1 as there were a couple of good bits, the air crash and ....Darn, was there another good clip? I'll give it the extra 1 for Annabelle Wallis.

301,ReelLifeReviews,Not the best launching point,6,9 June 2017,"The Mummy (2017) - The launching point for Universal's 'Dark Universe' is, at best, an average action flick. Cheesy one-liners and pure convenience mar what could have been a successful introduction to this new franchise.I thought the studio's idea to bring back the classic monster movies was a little out there. But when they started getting A-list talent involved, it got me really interested. Tom Cruise in The Mummy, Russell Crowe as Jekyll & Hyde, Javier Bardem as Frankenstein's monster, and Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man? How do you not buy in to something like that? I can only hope those other movies can learn from this one.As is often the downfall of potentially good films, this one suffers from being indecisive when it comes to tone. The main culprit is Tom Cruise's sidekick, played by Jake Johnson. While serious events are happening around every other character, he for some reason thinks he's in a late 90's comedy. His lines, and his character overall, are a big distraction. In a movie that has magic, mummies, and monsters, this guy's character was the most unbelievable element of the whole thing.Sofia Boutella, however, was quite strong as the titular character. I hadn't gotten a whole lot out of her from the previews, but she was by far the standout. The lore that they introduced with her character was a driving force for the film and she played it perfectly. The writers did a solid job of making her sympathetic while also straight up evil.On the surface, The Mummy is essentially an Egyptian episode of The Walking Dead. Yes it's entertaining, but we're ultimately just spinning our wheels. I only wish the movie had fully committed to the handful of darker moments that were peppered in. There's a great horror movie under there somewhere- the editor just couldn't find it.",The Mummy
302,DJKwa,A lifeless reboot that promises more than it can deliver,4,27 June 2017,"The most surprising thing in the new Mummy reboot occurs in the first ten seconds. Right after the Universal logo ends, the globe spins and a shiny new logo is revealed. In bold, black lettering, the text ""Dark Universe"" appears emblazoned on a solar eclipse. The logo marks the beginning of a new initiative, which involves Universal giving their iconic monster properties a modern reworking, beginning with The Mummy (2017). It's surprising because with the tease of an extended universe, Universal proceed to deliver a reboot so generic and lifeless that it pretty much destroys interest in their future plans.The Mummy is a modern update that only does the bare minimum in fulfilling the requirements of a mindlessly entertaining, popcorn blockbuster. It lacks the atmosphere, tension or even inventive action to offer anything more than basic B-movie thrills from its blockbuster $125 million budget. Only the stunts are moderately impressive, but they pale in comparison to what Tom Cruise has already done far better in his Mission: Impossible franchise. Even the film's heavily promoted zero gravity sequence is little more than what was shown in the trailer contextualised. More disappointingly, though, is that the film uses its nonstop action to distract you from the cobbled together storytelling.The film's story problems are evident in the first ten minutes. The opening scenes are messily stitched together as they jump between the past and the present, busily trying to establish the film's lore. We are first introduced to Russell Crowe's Dr. Henry Jekyll, after his team discover an ancient tomb deep below present day London. At this point there's no mention of who he is or what his significance is to the story. He simply appears and the film abruptly cuts to his heavy-handed narration of the origins of the Mummy. It's an awkward exposition dump that feels like the product of a screenplay that has been worked over a few too many times.Then the story suddenly shifts to the middle of Iraq where we meet Tom Cruise's character. Cruise plays ex-US military officer, Nick Morton, an intrepid adventurer-cum-ancient artifact procurer. Together with his fellow explorer and military buddy, US Sergeant Chris Vail (Jake Johnson), they stumble upon an ancient prison where the tomb of the vengeful Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) lies. After excavating the tomb and placing it aboard an aircraft, a flock of birds suddenly cause the plane to crash and the reawakened Princess is unleashed upon the world. Thus ensues a race against time to stop her from fulfilling an ancient prophecy that puts the fate of the world at risk. It's typical fantasy fluff that is not so much bad as completely derivative.It also doesn't help that the film is a tonal mess. Any detours into dark territory are quickly diffused with off-putting comedy, making the film feel decisively more silly than scary. It seems like the filmmakers have taken a page out of Marvel's handbook, matching action sequences with frequent bouts of comedic relief, and it just doesn't gel well with the darker material. Clearly the film was made with a teen audience in mind and the result is your typical M-rated action blockbuster, full of goofy humour and noisy set pieces with nothing distinct to set it apart.On the acting side things aren't much brighter. Throughout the years, Tom Cruise has proved to be a reliable action star, but even he feels like a fish out of water in the fantasy genre. Fighting off skeletal zombies just doesn't fit his style and he looks bewildered amidst the cheesy special effects and supernatural goings-on. Russell Crowe doesn't fare any better, turning in a dispirited performance as Dr. Jekyll, the leader of a clandestine organisation called Prodigium. Think of him like Nick Fury from S.H.I.E.L.D, except for monsters not superheroes, and without Samuel L. Jackson's level of energy or enthusiasm. For such a pivotal part, not just in the film, but also in the connected universe, his evident disinterest in the material only compounds the problems facing the ""Dark Universe"" in the future. Only Sofia Boutella stands out as the titular Mummy. The former dancer puts her training to good use by contort her body in all manner of creepy and unsettling ways. Unfortunately the film's light-hearted tone means her character never feels as scary or sinister as it should.Overall, as a generic action blockbuster, The Mummy is passably entertaining. But as an earnest attempt to sell you a new cinematic universe, the film is neither engaging nor interesting enough to be considered a success.

I hate movies with, what I call ""oh, come on!"" moments... moments so ludicrous that they take you right out of the movie. The Mummy had about fifteen ""oh, come on"" moments in the first ten minutes everything from plot implausibilities, to bad characterizations, to just plain bad acting! To be perfectly honest, I didn't make it through the first half hour. Maybe after that it turned into the Citizen Kane of horror movies...but I doubt it.",The Mummy
304,regula1,A pleasant surprise that could easily have been a monster disaster,7,8 June 2017,"The Mummy has gone through some different phases during its lifetime, from its humble horror roots in the 1930s with Boris Karloff to its campy fun thrill ride with Brendan Fraser.Now comes Tom Cruise to usher The Mummy into a new era, and for a film that's supposed to kick-off the Dark Universe, a cinematic universe of classic monster icons, it could easily have been a disaster, a just reward for Universal's presumptuousness for thinking it could match the likes of Marvel for cinematic universe-building.Instead, while it's not without its flaws, The Mummy has some interesting twists and turns that make me want to see how they develop it from this point forward.In the latest re-brand of the classic franchise, Tom Cruise plays the dapper Nick Morton, an Army reconnaissance officer with treasure- hunting ambitions, dragging along his sidekick Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) into a dubious plan to raid an Iraqi village swarming with insurgents of its antiquities.What they discover is nothing anyone expected: the long-lost tomb of Amonet (Sofia Boutella), an ancient princess robbed of her birthright who sold her soul to the Egyptian devil and lives again to wreak havoc on a modern world.On the surface, this film seems to be cliché after cliché, with the usual casual banter between the lead action hero and a love interest with not a whole lot to do (Annabelle Wallis filling this role) and random undead beings chasing our hero from one set piece to another.However, this film shines in what fills the space in between clichés, such as the inevitable comic relief, Jack Johnson's Vail, who pops in now and again to provide good-natured humor without overstaying his welcome. Also, Ruseel Crowe's character, the head of a secret organization protecting the world from supernatural threats, fills a cliché but provides an interesting preview of what is to come (I can't give his character name, as it would spoil the surprise).Most importantly, Sofia Boutella's re-imagined Mummy, while fulfilling cliché monster badness, adds a certain amount of depth to her performance that propels this movie in ways that you may not expect, or if you do then at least in a manner that's satisfying rather than eye-roll worthy.Finally, it's the promise of what can be that makes this film so intriguing. Going into this film, I was skeptical as to whether or not this film could deliver on the same caliber as Iron Man for launching a cinematic universe. Now, I am intrigued by how they are going to deliver on all the teasing they do in one sequence through a vault of artifacts (also, be on the look-out for a blink-and-you-miss-it Easter egg to a previous Mummy film at about the half-way point).It's not a great film, especially given its propensity for huge time- jumps that have to be explained with fragmented dialogue as to what happened during thousands of years-worth of history.Nevertheless, The Mummy is a satisfactory launch of the Dark Universe, and I am curious for more.",The Mummy
305,timrossminister,Utterly banal,4,19 July 2019,"It's difficult to tell what this film is supposed to be. If it's a horror, it's just not scary, if it's a thriller, there's no suspense, if it's an adventure, it's completely lacking in excitement and if it's supposed to be darkly funny, you won't be laughing.
Poor old Tom does his best to try to put something into the weak script, but even he appears not to know quite whether he's supposed to be playing a serious or comic part.
The vfx are rather unoriginal too, looking like something out an 80s video game.
There are worse versions of The Mummy which are far better.",The Mummy

307,TheJediWay9,"The Reboot of ""The Mummy"" Should've Stayed Dead In Its Crypt",5,12 June 2017,"""The Mummy"" is the third telling of the classic ""Mummy"" story and this time stars Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, and Jake Johnson, and while in Iraq, the thief discovers the tomb of a mummy from ancient Egypt and unleashes its hell into the world. I was in no way excited for this movie. I really enjoyed the first two Brenda Fraser Mummy movies-- ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns""-- but totally hated the third one of his ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" That was by and large a straight atrocity to cinema, so I went into this hoping it would at least be better than that one, and luckily it is, but that's about it. This movie is okay, it's just fine. It's one of those movies that you would see if had something else to do and needed time to kill. My biggest issues with the movie are the screenplay, tone, and visual effects. The screenplay tries to do so much in so little time. There are so many plot threads in this film it can become tiring following all of them, and it feels overstuffed. There's these visions Tom Cruise is seeing, there's this thing with Jake Johnson, there's this Knights Templar scene, there's this dagger with a jewel on its hilt that is totally not the Dagger of Time from Prince of Persia (seriously its the exact thing), there's Russell Crowe and his character, and of course there's the mummy stuff. This movie is 110 minutes long, and with everything they tried to cram into this movie it felt they were trying too hard to jump start a cinematic universe all in one movie, which to me is what led this movie to be overstuffed. This movie is completely devoid of character development as well. Tom Cruise delivers a good performance and further proves that he is still an action star, but his character is not fleshed out. We just know that he's a thief and he awoke a centuries old mummy. Jack Johnson has literally nothing. Russell Crowe is probably the most developed character of the bunch, but even then he's overdeveloped for me in this movie. Annabelle Wallis' character... she came out of nowhere. What is her character?As I've stated, Tom Cruise was good. It wasn't best performance, but he was functional and serviceable enough for me to actually somewhat care. For me the standout was Sofia Boutella as the Mummy. I think she is really an underrated actress. She's not gonna win any Oscars or anything, but she played the mummy very convincingly, and she seemed really dedicated in her performance.This movie just didn't know what it wanted to be tone wise. Did it want to be the campy, action adventure, light hearted movie that the first two Brendan Fraser movies were, or did it want to be this dark, horror, scary suspense movie that the original was like. It's kind of somewhere in between. There's a lot of humor that doesn't land in this movie when the movie is trying to be a fun action-adventure, but then isn't too scary when it's going for the other end of the spectrum. It was just somewhere in the middle and it fell flat. The action scenes were somewhat fun. I will lie if say i wasn't entertained while watching them. But while watching them, it's the visual effects that really distracted me, especially in the third act. That scene from the trailer where the mummy is a huge giant in London, yeah, the effects there weren't too great and really looked cheap. Also something with Russell Crowe's character that made me wanna laugh. His face literally turned black and blue and veins were protruding from his face, it looked like his face was ready to pop. It was really jarring. Speaking of Russell Crowe... other than The Nice Guys, since 2010 he has stopped caring. He's like Bruce Willis. He's Russell Crowe playing Russell Crowe. It's been bothering me for almost a decade now.The movie wasn't atrocious like ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"" was, however if I'm gonna watch Mummy movies I'm gonna watch the first two with Brendan Fraser and skip this one unless it's on cable TV or Hulu at 4 in the morning, and never touch Fraser's third one. It think it's ""fine."" It's probably the best Mummy movie we are going to get at this point, which kind of disappoints me because I like monsters like this. I really wish ""Dracula Untold"" was part of this Dark Universe because even though that's not a good movie, I do enjoy watching that movie and had a lot more fun with that than I did with this. This is okay, a disposable summer blockbuster that will entertain some but not most.I am going to give ""The Mummy"" a C-Thank you for taking the time to read my review and if you have the chance check out my video review over on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUa1K2ujfbk",The Mummy

I have no idea what dark universe is.I think too many times we let our expectations spoil a movie for us. This wasn't a remake of any mummy movie I've seen and I think I've seen em all.

309,targe1314,Better than expected but Tom and Russell definitely sink it,6,14 June 2017,"I was dragged into this movie after reading 100% bad reviews on it everywhere I turned. I was expecting to sleep and perhaps spend quality time in the theatre bathroom.instead I actually started to really enjoy this movie, until Tom Cruise pulled down his scarf and began his sabotage.The visuals are stunning, if a bit weird at times (a shot of a Pharaoh and his daughter gazing at the pyramids has them represented in their present-day decay, not shining and brand new as they would have been during the Pharaoh's time)Set, btw, is NOT the Ancient Egyptian 'God of Death', he is the god of desert, storms, chaos, violence, and foreigners. The closest they have to a god of death is a good guy, Anubis, who is really more of a funeral director... anyway, history lesson over...Sofia Boutella is simply stunn-a-lishious as the evil usurper queen Ahmanet. She rocks the skimpy bandages most effectively.Tom, otoh, is a Mission Impossible agent trapped in a monster movie, and he runs around literally trying to escape it (or have sex with Sofia...) the entire movie. Horror-if-ic mis-cast here, and now he's trapped in the series, which I hope dies a horrible screaming death like a vampire trapped in a sun room at dawn.Tom fights hordes of zombies, getting his foot or hand stuck in them more than once, and has a swim race with some.Russell Crowe is just as bad as Tom, playing a simply horrible version of Dr. Jekyl, which consists of Russell Crowe, and turning into Mr. Hyde, consists of Purple Russell Crowe with a Cockney accent.Sofia tries to save the movie, mostly consisting of strutting entrances with men bowing to her, was waiting for the linen-wrapped dance pole rise up from the ground. And she is the best part of the movie.I cringe to think where we are going with this Dark Universe, and it's aim to completely destroy the careers of two A-list actors.",The Mummy
310,iamjacksmoviechannel,An outright disastrous start for any Universe,3,8 June 2017,"""The Mummy"" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their ""Dark Universe."" Yeah, that's right. Those re-shoots that 2014's ""Dracula Untold"" went through to tie into a Dark Universe; those don't matter now. That 2010 Benicio del Toro ""Wolfman"" movie; also doesn't matter. In a world where Universes are becoming more and more of a thing, Universal seems determined not to let this monster mash-up of The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde and more slip through their fingers. And they're also not skimping out on finding A-list talent to help sell the whole thing. So far we've heard Johnny Depp, The Rock, and Javier Bardem's names being thrown into the mix, plus Russell Crowe is already here as Dr. Jekyll. That last one I think is really cool by the way because while so many others have been portrayed by the likes of Gary Oldman and Jack Nicholson's, Jekyll's best portrayal in the past 20+ years has been ugh.David Hasselhoff. But now let's talk about ""The Mummy"", specifically that old trilogy with Brendan Fraser. There's no doubt director Stephen Sommers lucked out with that first film and there's also little doubt Universal wants to move away from that overall cheesiness here. The question is can they still go serious but also have fun at the same time?And say what you will about Sommers; the guy was a C-grade filmmaker who got a kick out of a cheap thrill but at least you could say he committed to it. This new Mummy is just a wrong-headed disaster. The set-up is pretty much the same as the older Mummy film although here it's a woman played by ""Kingsman's"" Sofia Boutella. She's Ahmanet, an Egyptian Princess who wanted power, sold out to some powerful entity for eternal life, and paid for it by getting entombed.Universal of course is also putting it's faith in Tom Cruise, who plays an Army Vet prone towards treasure hunting. He and several others find Ahmanet's sarcophygus but while bringing it back to be examined, the plane goes down over London and a bunch of strange things happen that they learn can't just be coincidence. This is Cruise just being Cruise here. He gets to run around a lot doing his ""intense face"" all while an attractive woman half his age is along with him for the sexual interplay (more on her in a moment). Yeah, there's discussion about his character growing something of a conscience as this goes on but it's pretty perfunctory.Plus having the Mummy be a woman after Cruise's body so she could plant her demon God inside of him and they can reign as King and Queen; this seems more like it falls into being of one of Cruise's aging vanity projects than on acting skill. Boutella gets very little to do otherwise but try and be seductive while waving her hands in a threatening manner. Otherwise auto-tune does the rest. The Cruise character's love interest is an archaeologist played by Annabelle Wallis who looks like she just stepped out from a Paris fashion show into an archaeological dig. Did I believe her as an archaeologist? No. Did I believe she could spell it? Sure. Either way, it doesn't matter. What does is that she and Cruise are DOA in their scenes together. No character makes much impression here, including Crowe's Dr. Jekyll who's maybe in the film for 20 minutes to explain stuff so simplistic, silly, and predictable that it hardly needs explaining at all before the film rushes through his particular ailment. For some reason screenwriters David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie think more explanation is still warranted though and in that they couldn't be more wrong. For something trying to feel new, it's remarkably easy to tell where all this is going. Their biggest crime is what they do to New Girl's Jake Johnson, a funny actor who they turn into the Dark Universe's version of Jar Jar Binks in only five minutes. He comes in and out of the film at really odd intervals, either screaming dialogue in the hope of making it funny or giving us yet more exposition we don't really need. Add to that first time action director Alex Kurtzman is a disaster. The action sequences look haphazardly thrown together, just cartoonish and unbelievable, while a spoiler I won't give away about the Tom Cruise character makes them even harder to give a crap about anyway. The fights are stiff and uninteresting, and the special effects are either forgettable or look just as hokey as they did in the Brendan Fraser movies. The plane sequence we saw in the trailer looks pretty decent but hey, you've already seen the most decent thing in the movie, why pay to see the rest. Overall this is not just a bad film, but a film that has no idea what it even is. It wants to resurrect classic monsters, but isn't the least bit scary. It wants to take it in original directions, but winds up being an ultra-serious, dull version of the 1999 film. It's silly but not funny, it's a lot of commotion but no excitement, it's a Mummy movie that if the ending of this can even be believed, thinks it's something totally different.

311,michaelrthomson,Not what it could have been,3,11 July 2017,"Film making should be thought of like being a chef... if you're going to reinvent/remake/reboot something, then doesn't it make sense that the reinvention should surpass the original?Sadly in this case there is nothing here that surpasses previous incarnations of The Mummy. I'm mostly looking at the Brendan Fraser/Rachel Weis versions in saying this, and after sitting through nearly two hours of this reinvention I am left wanting, much like the script writing, acting and editing.The applause for even the FX is moderate for me, I would think at this budget they could have done better, much much better.The acting as other reviewers say is wooden, dull and not at all at the level I would expect from the likes of Tom or Russell. The woman whose name I don't even remember hasn't been seen since her stint on the Tudors, and I can rather see why, was someone holding the script off camera for her to read off because it sure seemed like it based on the entirely heartless delivery.The only real shining light here was the woman playing the Mummy character, she at least seemed somewhat convincing in her minimal delivery.The story was boring, dull, tired and really quite uninteresting. I get the idea they are wanting to create a new 'universe' out of this, but if this is meant to be the 'Big Bang' to start us off, then it's really more a case of a sad whimper. As far as Universe's go, this is more of a Brown Dwarf than a Big Bang. The writers really need a good slap, I would have said they would have been better off just copying the Brendan Fraser version than they are with this load of galactic dust.So, in conclusion it seems best to me that these people go back to the kitchen and study hard on those books, try to learn a few basics and get those right before embarking on another adventure into film mastery because in no way does this movie match the BF version let alone surpass it.",The Mummy
312,PeterWorthers,The Mummy is turning over in its Sarcophagus....,4,13 June 2017,"Spoilers ahead folks I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I will tell you that every time I saw the trailer I said ""Nope, no way. Does not look interesting in the least bit."" But you give me a movie with Tom Cruise in it and 9 times out of 10 I will go see it. Plus the old Universal monsters are the best so the thought of seeing them in their glory on the big screen again was too good to pass up.This movie however left me feeling like it was either extremely rushed and things were overlooked, some scenes were left on the cutting room floor, or the script was rushed so they could start filming. It was half good action sequences and others that really didn't need to be there but seemed to fill in dead space. **Pun intended** The romance between Cruise and Wallis seemed unnecessary and awkward, like there was not enough time for them to develop then the next thing you know he's balling like they were old childhood friends.A few things did bother me, such as: If all it took was a spider bite to turn Cruises' friend into a 'zombie', why didn't the mummy just send spiders to the surface and bite a crap ton of people and get them to let her loose earlier? I have never seen someone run so much in my life. Cruise must have a clause in every contract that says he has to intensely run from each and every situation in his films.You're telling me the military just lets its people willy-nilly without knowing where they are at all times in the middle of a war, and that said war needs to have an archaeologist on the pay roll? Plus, the commanding officer finds out/knows about their illegal activity and just acts like it's another day in Iraq? The sarcophagus: Its billions of years old and its hanging from the helicopter just flapping in the wind, then the crew winches it up onto the 130 with nothing underneath it? That thing would have ripped up the plane floor not to mention screwed up the under part of the sarcophagus itself.In the church, the bad guys had Cruise all laid out and ready to go when the girl comes in. Seeing as how they were surrounded by graves, why didn't the mummy raise all of them to stop 2 people? If you are trying to take over the world why not raise the biggest undead army you can? Jekyll: I applaud the security measures to keep Hyde contained, but here's my thing; you can obviously tell you're going to change, have the serum pre-loaded and on you at all times, not sitting around for anybody to get. You feel the change come on, give yourself a hit and you're good. This secret society knows about the mysterious goings on and how to fight/destroy/contain them and they wait until halfway thought to do something? At first sign of the mummys return they should have been there containing the situation or the organization is useless.No jewel, no curse..Are you kidding? She goes to all that trouble to set things in motion, all the trouble to start the curse and to stop it all you have to do is break a Goodwill costume stone? Plus how is it that the 2 of them figured this out and not Jekyll, the head of this huge secret society that deals with this type of thing every day? But I digress.The Mummy tries so hard to establish the 'Dark Universe' for Universal that it misses the mark completely. If this is what we have to look forward to no number of big name stars or movie monsters will help them. All I'm saying is that this could have been so much better. This made me long for the old Brendan Frasier Mummy movie because it had heart. Every studio needs to stop trying to have what Marvel worked so hard for and worry about the beloved properties they are screwing up all in the name of a 'Shared Universe'.",The Mummy

Well, I saw it and for the life of me could not find much to complain about.After watching The Mummy do I agree with the premature flood of angry reviews? I was told The Mummy was not good, not good at all in many words. Well the truth is the critics lie and apparently bullying a movie out of the box office is alive and well. I was quite happy with The Mummy. I liked Nicks character played by Tom Cruises who I felt was believable for a fun summer action movie. Tom Cruise is best actor and great movie.In a flashback to the New Kingdom era, Princess Ahmanet is first in line to succeed her father Menehptre until his second wife gives birth to a son. Determined to claim the throne for herself, Ahmanet sells her soul to the Egyptian god Set, who agrees to help her if she uses a dagger to transfer his spirit into a corporeal form. After killing her family, Ahmanet attempts to sacrifice her lover to Set but is captured by her father's priests and condemned to be mummified alive for eternity. Her sarcophagus is buried in Mesopotamia and submerged in a pool of liquid mercury so that her monstrous form will not escape.In present-day Iraq, soldier-of-fortune Nick Morton and his partner Chris Vail accidentally discover the tomb of Ahmanet after staging an airstrike on an insurgent stronghold. Jenny Halsey, an archaeologist who had a one-night stand with Nick, arrives and investigates the tomb. After extracting Ahmanet's sarcophagus from a pool of mercury, Nick's superior, Colonel Greenway, places the sarcophagus on a transport plane headed to England. During the flight, Vail becomes possessed by Ahmanet's power. After attempting to open the sarcophagus, he stabs Greenway and attacks the group, forcing Nick to shoot him dead. A huge murder of crows then assaults the plane, causing it to crash and kill everyone on board except for Jenny, who is parachuted off the plane by Nick and nick, himself.Nick awakens a day later in a morgue in Oxford, and learns from Vail's ghost that he has been cursed by Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a replacement vessel for Set. Ahmanet's mummy escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on rescue workers to regenerate her decomposed body. Turning the workers into zombie minions, she lures Nick and Jenny into a trap, forcing the two to fight off the minions as they unsuccessfully try to escape. At the last second, unknown soldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet. Their leader, Dr. Henry Jekyll, explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. He confirms that Nick was cursed when he unlocked Ahmanet's tomb and reveals his intention to complete her ritual and allow Set to possess Nick in order to destroy Set and end his evil forever.Meanwhile, Ahmanet summons another spider to possess a Prodigium technician and frees herself from captivity, wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in the process. He and Jenny then escape from Prodigium while Ahmanet steals back the dagger, summons an army of deceased English crusaders to serve her, and creates a massive sandstorm that ravages London. Ahmanet to recover the ruby in the tomb and set it in the dagger's pommel, granting her all she needs to free Set.Guided by Vail, Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground tunnels, but are attacked by Ahmanet's minions. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her, hoping to break her hold over Nick. Nick puts up a fight, but gives up and lets himself embrace Ahmanet, using it as a ruse to steal the dagger and stab himself. Nick now have power of life so Nick uses Set's powers to overpower and suck the life out of Ahmanet, turning her back into a shriveled mummy. Nick harnesses Set's powers to resurrect Jenny, saying goodbye before becoming overwhelmed by Set's power and disappearing. Soon, Jenny regroups with Dr. Jekyll and they discuss if Nick, now fused with Set, will be good or evil. Ahmanet's corpse is lowered into a locked pool of mercury within the Prodigium base for safekeeping. Later on in the desert, Nick resurrects Vail, and the two set out on an adventure.",The Mummy

Cos she really wasn't I didn't find her to be either of those things she spoke very little and I found her to be a very stupid and pointless character for sure even Russell Crowe wasn't that great as Dr. Henry Jekyll basically in this film Ahmanet was set free by Nick and taken over by her she had chosen him for a ritual she was going to stab him with a dagger that would allow the God of death to inhabit his body but this is a major spoiler in the end he did it himself to stop her which was a pretty stupid move I mean he did stop her but he also did what Ahmanet wanted even though she didn't end up doing it to him. This was the most pointless film I've seen in 2017 so far,poorly acted,poorly filmed and the CGI was pretty terrible I really wouldn't recommend this I just didn't like the fact that the mummy in this was a female I liked it better when it was a male mummy this is obviously a reboot kind of but just with a female I hope they don't make a sequel to this and I hope the next film in Universal's Dark Universe whatever it will be is much better.

Let me be clear: The Mummy is no Citizen Kane or High Noon, and it will never find its way in the Library of Congress Film Registry catalog...
However, 16%?
Yes, a quite a few things are wrong with the movie. The ""MIA comic relief"" in the person of Vail (Jake Johnson). The narrative would have been well balanced had we experienced more of Vail: the few times he showed up, well, he stole the scenes. He comes up from time to time, but then watch the Deleted Scenes... he's in there. So it's a minus, yes.
Are the events predictable? You bet. Mainly because it is borrowing from so many other movies (The Mummy, 20 years ago?) in terms of plot and narrative devices. 
The number of humans being sacrificed on the altar of horror movies (OK, this guy's history, etc.) is staggering and, yes, predictable.
This being said.
The plot is reasonably well established, the action sequences are more than adequate and are, indeed, very well done. The acting is not worthy of any kind of award ceremony, granted, but very believable. 
Some movies were critical duds because they were bad, with plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon or with stories that would leave you uninterested (Warcraft, Suicide Squad), but this is not the case at all with The Mummy.
It is enjoyable with a Tom Cruise not taking himself too too seriously (at times...) Sofia Boutella is amazing as the evil Ahmanet, the princess fighting for her gender (and herself...) in Ancient Egypt and extending her struggle to today's London. 
Russell Crowe is equal to himself and appear to have the time of his life playing the Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy. Yes, I would recommend The Mummy. I would even give it a B+.",The Mummy
323,sorendanni,A big budget alone does not make for a good film,3,10 April 2020,"The Mummy 2017 starts promisingly, and will catch your attention for half an hour. The film is filmed beautifully and the special effects are 1st class.Unfortunately, the film falls flat afterwards. Halfway through the movie I started to get annoyed with 2 things:1. Tom Cruise has been miscast, terribly miscast! He plays his part a bit like playing Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible, but much less sympathetic, much less passioned. I have never really found Tom Cruise to fit for more darker roles, but he doesn't even bother trying with The Mummy. I never seen somebody first awakening from the dead and then hearing he is cursed with so little intrest. I can go on about everything that is wrong with Tom Cruise his performance, but you get my point. I would have much preferred Brendan Fraser from the 1999 movie to be in this film again!2. Which direction do you want to take with this film? Did anyone involved in the proces actually know? It is certainly not scary! I aint funny neither. And exciting? Nope, not even close. The story is predictable, unoriginal and full of loose ends. One example: Russel Crowe does a creditable acting performance as Dr Jeckyll, but his role is not deepened and is more reminiscent of an aftertought.In conclusion, given the large film budget and the reputation of the 1999 movie that was on stake, this film is a very big disappointment. Therefore only 3/10.",The Mummy

Each sequence leaves you wishing for a bit more. You find yourself wondering if the writer was given a bullet-point list of scenes / actions he was required to include. Therefore the film feels more like a high-priced visual madlib than a coherent picture.I wanted to like this movie, sometimes we just need more eye-candy films that we can decompress to, however, this one just failed on so many levels that it left a bitter taste of being half-baked but stale at the same time.",The Mummy

Lol...$125 million to make this movie? The acting stunk. The writing was pathetic. Attempts at humor were lame. Attempts at horror elements were half-hearted. CGI was sub-par.

Felt very congested, lots of action sequences strung together, like they were trying to impress but without a decent plot line to hold it all together. Surprised also about the casting and lack of believability, the acting was as hollow as the mummy itself.It's got to be one of those 'Emperor's got no clothes' movies, you want to believe it's better than it really is.

The effects were very well done, the undead mummy, zombies etc, made me jump several times.

The plot just flopped along in a very predictable and boring way. The humor was stupid, it completely took away any seriousness or fear from the movie. There was nothing scary about this movie. Everyone is doing stupid things. The cheap effects take away from the movie. You don't care about anyone in the movie. It was like a bad parody of much better movies. Like, the dead friend who is cursed and comes back to Tom Cruise'So character to taunt him. The same scenario from The American Werewolf in London. The mummy scenes the sand storm turning into the shape of the mummy's mouth. The same scene from previous mummy movie. I agree that choosing Tom Cruise for the role he played was wrong. I never thought he was the character, I kept thinking how terrible Tom Cruise is acting. The story line with Dr.Jekle and Mr.Hyde was dumb. It was boring. And the monster effects were sorry.

340,scandinavianmail,Suicide Squad as a Mission Impossible movie,4,8 June 2017,"As he's getting older, Tom Cruise is increasingly able to elevate even terrible material. The latest Mummy reboot doesn't have much going on except Cruise's dedicated head-on Ethan Hunt-esque performance and ability to land even bad jokes as well as they can possibly land. It's just that he has no chemistry with Annabelle Wallis, who has the ability of stalling any scene to a complete halt, and there isn't much tension between him and the Mummy lady Sofia Boutella either. As the story wants us to believe that there is some sort of a triangle drama going on and everything depends on its outcome, the premise fails to get off the ground and so does the movie.The multitude of screenwriters have produced a string of entertaining scenes during the first half of the movie, but as the story gets ever more high-flying without much wind under its wings, these scenes become too disjointed and stop making sense far before the end which is so similar and equally poorly written as the Suicide Squad's finale that it is not easy to believe also this director wanted to get burnt in the same fire. The confused ending implies that later on we'll be served with some movie having something to do with this one but it isn't necessarily Mummy 2. Or maybe it is.",The Mummy
341,Elain-ee,Misogynist Trash,2,1 November 2018,"I'm kind of a fan of the original mummy series - it was funny as well as a bit dark, and it had a strong but sensual female lead. The mummy was kind of hot too, and had a definite sense of supernatural strength about him.By contrast, here we're given a waifish mummy who has no passion, no sensuality and no zest for anything, just a parasitic need to manipulate men. I guess the writer had a bad divorce, a rebellious teen daughter or just a sane mom yelling at him when he created this steaming turd of a film, which reeks of anti-female hysteria from beginning to end.As with nearly all major films these days - in particular, remakes - the qualities of humour and female strength that made the original a hit have been pretty much eviscerated from this version. Instead we have a female who 'terrorises' men by threatening to sleep with them, which leads them to attempt to kill her in a bunch of absurdly phallic ways. The lab where she eventually ends up seems to have been inspired by the producer's penchant for sadistic. woman hating, porn websites. Despite all the nudity present here, the film has a weird, stale kind of Puritanical vibe. There's not a second of real eroticism in it, unlike the original. Rather than a film, it seems a sad testament to the pathetic, neurotic Mummy issues of the person standing behind the camera.If you're a human being with any taste or sense of self respect, avoid this. Seriously, it's that bad. Dark Universe would be better off donating its funds to a battery and assault center for women than sinking them in any other ventures that are as devoid of entertainment value as this film has been.",The Mummy
342,childers-3,Overpaid to see this on Redbox,1,11 October 2017,"This was just awful! I like Tom Cruise, but they could have gotten a no-name actor and stuck him in this role and saved the money they paid Cruise to enhance the special effects. And the plot. And the screenplay. The only mildly entertaining portion was Russell Crowe as Henry Jekyll/Mr. Hide. It was awful too, but, Crowe makes me smile no matter what he's doing. I love this guy's mug. They could have used a cardboard cutout for Annabelle Wallis for all the spark she brought to her role as the ""archeologist"". I think it was a bad idea to make the mummy a woman. That may sound sexist, but it just felt wrong. The 1932 version of The Mummy, with Boris Karloff, was kind of boring, but the first 10 minutes of that movie still sends a chill down my spine. It was so incredibly creepy when Imhotep slowly opens his eyes when the guy in the room with him begins reading aloud from the sacred scroll. That tiny piece of screen time blew this current version out of the water! You don't need big explosions, face sucking deaths and camel spiders to make a scene scary.

I thought ""The Mummy"" might be like a long ""Ancient Aliens"" episode--silly but worth watching. ""The Mummy"" really wasn't, worth watching that is. The dialogue between Tom and the female Egyptologist are tortuous--Mr. Cruise looks young but you know he's in his fifties and he's spouting stuff like a college kid. Some of the scenes are so dark you can't see what is happening. At no time but the movie get scary.

345,rs403404,This Mummy is Deader than Most,2,10 June 2017,"What are you doing Universal?Perhaps that's not the right question. You're making your Dark Universe franchise which is your answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe except instead of superheroes you have monsters. That's cool and given the history of monster movies of the past, it makes as much sense as any cinematic universe. Your goal was to start this universe with 2014's ""Dracula Untold"", but you changed your minds when that movie was (rightfully) poorly received. So, now you're going to try to start this franchise off with this new version of ""The Mummy"". Hell, you even got Tom Cruise to star and Russell Crowe to co-star as Henry Jekyll, undoubtedly being set up for his own solo movie.However, the kicker here is that ""The Mummy"" is actually a worse movie than ""Dracula Untold"". ""Dracula Untold"" was a generic action movie with a Gothic setting and tone. Was it the right way to treat a Dracula movie? Of course not, but at least it was cohesive and had a clear point to it's existence. I cannot say the same for ""The Mummy"".""The Mummy"" begins in England, where a secret tomb is discovered and we see news broadcasts telling us all this speculation about what this tomb could be. Then, the movie begins again giving us the origin of this film's titular mummy Ahmanet, played by Sofia Boutella. Then the movie begins for a third and final time showing us Nick Morton (Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) looking for artifacts in Iraq. You might think such a location would be a setup for a commentary on war but you'd be wrong. The Iraq setting only provides some incredibly poorly cobbled together action. For some unfathomable reason, the heroes find an ancient Egyptian tomb...in Iraq. To the filmmaker's credit, they do at least think to bring up the question; they just neglect to answer it. If this movie's goal was to make ""Kong: Skull Island"" appear to be a deeply intellectual thinkpiece by comparison, then mission accomplished.Say what you will about 1999's ""The Mummy"", at least it was a fun movie despite it's many flaws. 2017's ""The Mummy"" spends time pretending to be horror and other times pretending to be action. David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie are listed as screenwriters for this garbage fire, which is baffling considering the talent they've shown in the past. I am less impressed with director Alex Kurtzman who is primarily known as a writer for such films as ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", """"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", and ""The Legend of Zorro"". My opinion of him is very simple, without some sort of hand to guide him like JJ Abrams, his work ends up being rubbish. ""The Mummy"" has done nothing to dissuade this opinion. What's worse, Universal hired him to work on other stories in their Dark Universe. So, my original question still holds merit. Not in that I am unsure what Universal is doing, but I don't think they have any idea how to successfully reach their goal.So, what are you doing Universal?",The Mummy
346,reoroy,"We see Tom Cruise more than ""The Mummy""",7,7 June 2017,"I'm back after watching The Mummy. One of the most conspicuous things that I realized about this film was the monster universe umbrella name, Dark Universe that appeared before the movie began. It is quite apparent that making movies under the 'Dark Universe' umbrella is yet another marketing gimmick of the entertainment giant which might help them to assert some authority in the cinema business. These movies might be the basis for more joy-rides at Universal's amusement parks.Also the studio has managed to hire one of the biggest stars of Hollywood, Tom Cruise to be the face of this film. Tom Cruise is a brand name and most studios are confident that his name should suffice in order to receive high box-office returns. But that's where things become extremely tricky. This film has been promoted more as a Tom Cruise vehicle than as a movie that deals with the resurgence of a mystical Ancient Egyptian Dark Force. I got to see Tom Cruise so much in this film that I wondered why the director couldn't spare enough screen-time for the Mummy herself. Yes, there is an origin story that tells the tale of how The Mummy ended up being who she was. But it seemed so hasty and superficial. It appeared as if the makers of this film were too focused on giving Tom Cruise more screen-time than the Mummy. When you give a certain name to a film, I presume the name would indicate the subject of the film. The importance of the subject in this film gets compromised at the expense of a secondary/tertiary character played by Tom Cruise.Otherwise this film has almost every trope that seems to be an integral part of most Tom Cruise films. I am not asking you guys not to watch this film . Your experience at the movie theater might be directly proportional to how strong a fan of Tom Cruise you are. If you prefer Tom Cruise's mere presence over the movie's story-line then you will love this film. And I wish I could see more of Russell Crowe in this film . We do get to hear his cosmic voice in the background when the movie begins. His baritone is epic. But I wish his presence in this film could be equated with his divine voice. I wish The Mummy wasn't a film but an expository documentary narrated by Russel Crowe about a super-star pretending to fend off an Egyptian monster.",The Mummy
347,Laiath,Not bad if you don't think about it too much,5,9 June 2017,"It may be because my expectations were seriously low thanks to critics' reviews, but I enjoyed the movie. The horror aspect was surprisingly good; I wasn't prepared to feel scared, which is always a nice surprise. Although there were some pretty lame scenes where even I could have delivered the lines better, the story, the visual effects, and some really funny dialogue made up for it.That being said, I don't know why Chris ended up as a ghost/zombie when every other undead being was physically touchable, beatable, visible, and non-omnipresent. Besides, why did he start out as a mindless zombie that tried to kill even Nick, if his sole purpose was to serve Ahmanet and he knew Nick was her chosen one? And if he was going to be a mindless zombie, why did he change into a ghost that was all BFFs with Nick again? Also, I don't think it made sense for Nick to make a sacrifice of that magnitude for Jenny given how his character was portrayed and their ridiculously short relationship history. And I'm sorry, but you can't have a money crazed crook take back control of his body and mental facilities from ""Satan himself"" (Dr. Jekyll's words, not mine). Is Nick gonna turn out to be the bastard son of a Celestial as well? Please. As for the acting, I think Tom Cruise had no chemistry whatsoever with any of the other cast members, and -maybe because of that- he looked like he was trying too hard. Annabelle Wallis looked like someone had dropped her into the scene and she'd barely had time to look at her lines; she sounded that fake and out of place. Luckily, she was somehow wayyy better in the second half of the movie than she was in the first half. Russell Crowe looked like he was wearing someone else's clothes, figuratively speaking, so I hope he grows into the role more in the upcoming movies. Sadly, I thought Jake Johnson's role as the comic relief failed miserably, despite his great, natural performance. I hope the failure of this movie doesn't mark the end of the Dark Universe as I'm still kind of looking forward to seeing it explored, but this should be a lesson learned for everyone involved in the upcoming productions. It's no easy feat messing up a movie this badly when you have all the time, money, and resources in the world not to mention great actors.",The Mummy
348,gtyoshida,Good Entertainment,8,25 June 2017,"""The Mummy"" is a good, summertime flick with plenty of humour, sustained action, and entertaining fantasy. Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) are two mercenaries trapped by insurgents on a village rooftop in Iraq (originally called Mesopotamia). When Chris orders an airstrike, the bombs open up the ancient tomb of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), an ambitious warrior who tried to kill her Pharaoh with a bejewelled dagger so that Set, the god of Death, could assume his fallen body. The Pharaoh's priests caught her committing the ritual act and mummified her alive then entombed her chained in a pool of mercury. Before Nick and Chris can loot the tomb, Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), a London archaeologist sent by Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) to recover the mummy and the dagger, takes control of the operation. Nick shoots the pulley of chains to free the sarcophagus from the poisonous pool of mercury but the noise enrages a bunch of camel spiders who bite Chris in the neck injecting him with a venom that eventually changes his behaviour and forces Nick to kill him. Princess Ahmanet wants to gain Nick's loyalty and appears before him as a vision but Dr. Jekyll is determined to uncover her power over death and moves the sarcophagus to his facility under the Natural History Museum of London where he begins to pump mercury back into the mummy. Both Cruise and Jake Johnson exchange witty banter and one liners throughout the movie but Johnson is the funnier of the two and unlike Simon Pegg (Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol), fits in perfectly as the buddy. Russell Crowe is adequate as the two faced Dr. Jekyll and Edward Hyde; however, his airy English accent makes his character sound rather foolish. Sofia Boutella shines as the mummified Princess Ahmanet but Annabelle Wallis contributes little beyond her slightly above average good looks. ""The Mummy"" is one of the better Tom Cruise movies and Jake Johnson stands out as the perfect sidekick.",The Mummy
349,yerlo,"Well crafted, entertaining, popcorn popping flick",9,15 June 2017,"My husband really liked it. Liked the new twist so much he mentioned it a few times and not because it was a female mummy this time. His comments are worth mentioning because fantasy & supernatural are favorite genres for him. Those are not my favorites, but I loved the old horror movies of my youth. For me, the telling point was that The Mummy had my attention all the way through. I didn't once think of Facebook. The sets were excellent. All the actors did very well with their characters although I think the Ms. Halsey character was a bit off. Don't know if it was the acting, the writing, some lack of chemistry between her and Cruise although who could not have chemistry with Cruise. You could see the chemistry from his end but not from hers. I don't think she was trying. I did think the reverse of chemistry of Cruise against the Mummy was well done while the Mummy obviously found him irresistible. As for PG-13 MEH. So some skeletons became people and some people became skeletons. The Mummy's morphing was really cool. You know in the old 1931 Dracula, the highlight was Dracula melting into a skeleton--we watched it just to see that. The ""suggestive content"" was so light that kids would not get this few seconds of verbal exchange, but a 13 year old might get a flicker. Partial nudity--so partial you could blink and miss her darkly lit butt. meh. No F bombs, no graphic sex, no political nor social agendas forced down our throats.

350,eden-rabatsch,Major misstep in trying to establish Dark Universe,5,10 June 2017,"The Dark Universe is established with a half mummified creature whose ambitions are so insane that through the power of self-belief and religious zealotry it is able to defy the Universe itself. And there is also a Mummy. When the Dark Universe was announced, I was worried and excited. I loved the Universal monsters of the 1930's and thought that with proper cultivation they could hearken back to the classic monsters but also harness modern CGI to revolutionise those stories. My fear was by announcing a Universe before establishing even one film that would mean an awful lot of world building, lathering's of exposition would be needed so that later films would be able to click together. Just like the DC films my worst fears have been realised. The brief plot line is that Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) embraces her dark ambitions and is mummified alive. Centuries later her tomb is discovered by some treasure hunters, Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) and a new evil is released on the world. Entangled in this mess is archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) and Dr. Jekyll (his name kinda gives away his character trajectory) played by Russell Crowe. The film is egregiously average. The plot line considering it is building a Universe is not that bad. It updates the monster cleverly. The creature design and Boutella's acting are some of the better aspects of the film. Unfortunately, it is never sure what type of film it is. I note that it had six writers and that seems to be in the DNA of the film. One scene will work and even be quite good, only for it to lurch considerably in tone the next as if it is now ""Abbott and Costello meet the Mummy"" and then shift back. I can't help but think Alex Kurtzman was not the person to helm this film. Notorious for films which make money but which are braindead notably a couple of Transformer films, he has not got the directing chops to patch the shifts. If only a Joss Whedon or Patty Jenkins was on tap. The acting apart from Boutella and a strong sidekick performance from Johnson are laughably woeful. Wallis who was quite good in ""Peaky Blinders"" is a cypher here and has absolutely no chemistry with Cruise. Russell Crowe hams it up again as if he is going to break into a song from Les Miserables but the worst are the undead eyes of lead puppet Cruise. For such a legendary charisma machine, there is just nothing there and he seems to know it. I almost felt bad for him So many bad decisions have been made that I am not sure how this can be fixed as I am sure many characters will submerge and re-appear across the Dark Universe when it might be better if all stayed entombed.",The Mummy
351,kristal-42201,The Mummy doesn't disappoint,8,14 August 2017,"In spite of all the negative reviews I liked this movie. The only thing I didn't like was Tom Cruise in this role. He is simply too old to get away with being physically the main macho attracting factor of a movie. He looks old and his face is fat, not very hunky or macho. He should've left this one for a younger, fitter man who would make a good counterpart for the sexy and evil Egyptian princess and Annabelle Wallis. Other than that, I liked it. It delivers what you expect. Yes, not very different from the other Mummy movies, and maybe predictable, but that's what I expected from this. It is what I wanted and I was not disappointed, bar for having to watch an over his prime Tom Cruise.So I honestly don't really get the complaints. A Mummy movie should fit into the sequel of the others, like an Alien/Batman/Superman or any sequel movie should do.One thing I did not get, what is the point of this Dr Jekyll, played by Russell Crow? Unless they plan to do something with that character in a later installment, it was utterly pointless, did not have any added value whatsoever. But again, in general I liked it, didn't disappoint.",The Mummy
352,dan_pap,not as good as the brendan fraser ones,6,23 June 2019,"""When one is dealing with the salvation of humanity certain sacrifices must be made.""I'm not ashamed to admit that I've always been a fan of the Mummy movies. From Boris Karloff to Brendan Fraser, something about ancient Egyptian curses makes for a great story. I wasn't expecting the Tom Cruise Mummy to be that great, but I waited a long time to watch it out of respect to the others.As a disclaimer, this isn't a great movie at all. This is probably my second to least favorite Mummy movie, but I still had a whole lot of fun watching it. The first half is really interesting, but the movie breaks apart from there.The cast doesn't fit well in the film. I don't mind Tom Cruise, but this just isn't his movie. Russell Crowe is especially out of place, and I don't even know why his character exists.The comedy is okay for the most part, but again the story becomes predictable as the movie goes on. The flashbacks are my favorite parts, and there are plenty to enjoy.This is just like the rest of the Mummy movies for me: not a good movie, but a guilty pleasure that I'll watch a few more times.",The Mummy
353,nestoryaviti,Look before you leap...,6,8 June 2018,"Wow! way to go... you just ruined a franchise because of going way too fast to furious to see where you even wanna take your franchise first. But as bad starts go, at least you tried",The Mummy
354,NormanCroucher,A Dark Universe of monsters... and Tom Cruise,4,9 October 2017,"The mission statement: The Dark Universe will rise from the Universal Pictures vaults to reclaim the horror genre and create an epic shared universe of mythic movie monsters who will eventually come together in an Avengers-style series of adventures that can fill the multiplexes for the next decade. The launch of this series will begin with an updating on 'The Mummy', featuring strong world building, scary creatures and effects, tense set-pieces and a creative mythology that can be explored across a dozen more movies. The result: A generic Tom Cruise action adventure with a mummy in it.The moment Tom Cruise signed onto this project, it was in trouble. You can't tell a truly compelling story based on The Mummy mythos if you have to service a huge movie star's ego at the same time. While I give Cruise credit for trying to do something different here, he is totally and utterly miscast in a 'selfish but charming rogue' role clearly written and intended for someone 25-20 years his junior. At one point Russell Crowe's equally miscast Dr. Jekyll calls him 'a young man' and, as good as Cruise looks for his age, it makes you roll your eyes. Cruise is doing his usual thing here: running, jumping, fighting, dating women half his age, shooting guns, and then running some more. The film bends and twists itself to appease the action hero clause in his contract and that undermines any sense of genuine horror or tension that may have emerged.It's not all Cruise's fault though. 'The Mummy' looks and feels distinctly set-bound, whether it's the underground tombs of Iraq or the narrow backstreets of London, and that is a real crime considering how much money was invested into the production. Unless the film is on location somewhere, almost everything looks like a set. I'd like to think that this stagey aesthetic was an attempt to callback to the classic horror films of yesteryear but I fear not. The artifice of the piece is always apparent and perhaps that is primarily a consequence of director Alex Kurtzman's inexperience behind the camera, or maybe it is more symptomatic of the designed- by-committee script. It's a generic A to B blueprint of what an action blockbuster should be, no doubt a result of all the different screenwriters brought on to service its creaky and familiar plot. It tries to use recognisable tropes and scenes from other horror stories to make you think that it's still staying true to its monsterific roots - it's the Dark Universe after all, not the Dark Superhero Universe - but something more akin to a superhero origin story is what this whole thing ultimately amounts too. We can't have Tom Cruise being an everyman horror movie character now can we?All that said, as generic and bland as this whole thing plays, it's not all that bad. There are some well staged set-pieces, namely the zero gravity sequence on the plane which was milked for every last dollar in the trailers, some fairly involving running around above and beneath London, and the promise of the other monsters to come. In that respect, the film does provide a reasonably solid enough foundation to build a universe on with the world of Henry Jekyll's monster hunters showing early signs of promise perhaps. I like the idea behind it all, but it just got buried in the avalanche of Tom Cruise.The Dark Universe didn't need to be a blockbuster franchise at all; Universal could have produced these films for $15-20 million each, released a new one every Halloween for four or five years and built- up to a bigger budgeted Avengers-style ensemble where the characters finally come together for some monster mayhem. That way, Universal would have saved themselves a lot of money and a lot of box office and critical disappointment. Something tells me that, in the years to come, this will become a textbook case on how 'too many cooks' can spoil the blockbuster broth.",The Mummy
355,turnbull50,Great take on an old story,10,13 May 2018,I loved this film from start to end. The special effects I thought where great. I loved the start in the underground chamber. I thought it brilliant when the mummy was walking down the street blasting both sides of the road. I liked the idea of using Mercury to disable the mummy. I also liked the way the tomb at the beginning was buried in Mercury. Liked the idea of using the cross rail project as a basis for fetching the corpses back to like. The ending where Tom Cruise is made immortal and gets to revive his friend and make him immortal and they ride off into the sunset is a brilliant ending. What's not to like. It seems once one person says a film is rubbish everybody else including people who have never seen the film pass on that it is rubbish and in this case it just isn't true this was one of the best films of 2017.,The Mummy
356,kurt-2000,Don't Hate Me For Liking It...,9,16 February 2018,"Ok....I enjoyed this film, when I really shouldn't have. Anyone who points out that the similarities between the Cruise/Kurtzman 'Mummy' and the Brendon Fraser/Sommers version, would be correct. There is way too much in common, to the point where many people asked, 'Why do a remake for the 2017 audience?' And it wasn't just Tom Cruise taking Brendon Fraser's place. Jake Johnson takes John Hannah's place as the funny side-kick. Annabelle Wallis takes Rachel Weisz's character as the heroine. It was the good call of replacing Arnold Vasloo's villain with the lusty Sofia Boutella that helped create the seduction pull of this 2017 version. She brought in the male viewers, regardless of what male viewers would admit. And I like any film even better when Russell Crowe is in the cast. Ok....then if the 1999 version and the 2017 version are so much alike, why even like the 2017 version? Special effects ambience and story line had a creepier feel than the 1999 version. The 2017 version simply made more sense as a story. Yes, I know that the sand cloud with the evil face made a comeback, but lots of remakes have been made in Hollywood, and some remakes just turned out better. I gave this film a 9 because it just felt like Egyptian lore and evil incarnate. So in my household, toss away the Brendon Fraser version and keep the Cruise/Kurtzman version. The people who hate this film got polluted by the Fraser 'Mummy' films, or they believe Cruise is socially incorrect and can't stand him. I watched this film on HBO and have it saved for later viewing.",The Mummy
357,ashishagupta,Dark future for monsters of dark universe from dark past,3,6 August 2017,"After 15 minutes of this movie, I had to pause, go online and see who directed this film. Sigh! Why is it that some directors think that audience of big budget movies are stupid. It is almost as if the director is punishing people for not going to watch quality indie movies instead.The Mummy is introduction of evil incarnate into a brand new franchise. A universe of famous monsters. Dr. Jekyll makes an appearance in this movie.In cartoons for children, the characters verbalize their thoughts and actions since children are too young to interpret contextual reasoning. The dialogue in such cartoons is simple without indulgence in complex abstract discussion and philosophical conundrums. Much of the seemingly serious discussion revolves around juvenile behavior and the cartoon has a sympathetic view of the poor coping mechanism of children. Therefore characters in cartoons get scared and scream like little children at the first sight of something strange and mildly disturbing. This builds a good rapport between the cartoon characters and the children since the actions, reactions and thoughts of the characters is on the same wavelength as children.Director Alex Kurtzman has followed just such a design principle in creating The Mummy. It is a movie in terms of its script, dialogue, plot, characters a film entirely devoted to juvenile audience.Since, 150 million dollars needs to satisfy a wider audience than just kids, the movie also has occasional mild nudity and suggestive dialogue. It's like an open letter: To whomever this may concern, Here is some mild nudity and suggestive adult humor. Your Sincerely,One outstanding feature of this movie is the unmissable jumps between scenes. You'd feel like you kept falling asleep every 5 minutes. But its just the movie. The need for continuity and logic is chucked out the door in the first few minutes. Characters keep turning up where ever and when ever, arguably moving at the speed of light between locations with uncanny omniscience. I almost felt that the character in the story would retort by saying, ""I am here because the movie director told me to"".In a movie about good and evil. I'd say the only thing good is the CGI whereas everything else: the story, the direction, the editing, is evil, pure evil. At a meta level the movie celebrates the triumph of modern CGI over traditional story telling.",The Mummy
358,davidvpcol,Great restart for The Mummy!,8,23 June 2017,"If you seek the best of the old Mummy movies combined with an original plot with great movie effects, you are in the right place. The Monsters Universe (not the MCU or DCEU) starts by adding multiple characters since the very beginning.Plot: Not the great twisting plot, but is very solid, personally I found it as an enhanced version of the old Mummy, here is good.Acting: Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe, just perfect. Boutella and Wallis nailed it too.Music: I was so much into the action I don't noticed it really. That good the action was.General comment: I liked a lot this movie, is a fresh start to a new world of gods and monsters. If you compare this franchise to other franchise, you are whipping your ass with the wrong paper, because this movie is not comparable to others, because there is not any other of this kind. All things got together in a exquisit way, so the action has sense and even tough some humour was out of place, the scenes were perfectly filmed and acted. I really found myself entertained and complete.I really didn't see it coming Crowe being Jekyll and Hyde!! That was thrown as a bomb, and if you listen carefully, Hyde talks much different than Jekyll! Nice touch ;) Ahmanet is not like Himhotep, even tough there were some Easter eggs (the golden book and the face in the sandstorm), but the motivation so set god Seth free is way better than simple revenge of the older movie. If you don't understand the ending: Tom Cruise (Morton) cuts himself with the dagger given to Ahmaneth. He gets the same powers as hers, and do not become Seth. I watched this movie in D-Box chairs (movement and vibration) and the experience was AWESOME! Highly recommended for this.",The Mummy
359,zaidmnomani,Another Failed Attempt At a Cinematic Universe,3,6 May 2020,"The Mummy (2017) is Universal's first (and only) movie in the Dark Universe. For those who don't know, the Dark Universe was to be a cinematic universe featuring all the monsters that Universal owns, such as Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and several other iconic characters.Obviously they were trying to replicate the success of the MCU, although they clearly didn't seem to realize the fact that people actually prefer superheros in an interconnected universe as opposed to monsters who's stories are very different in tone and style.But perhaps all this is irrelevant. Due to the underwhelming performance at the box office and the mostly negative reviews, Universal dropped their plans. And that's probably a good thing too, because if the other films they made were as bad as this one, then we would have had one of the worst franchises ever made in cinema history.This film is directed by Alex Kurtzman, who has also made other terrible films such as: The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Star Trek: Into Darkness, and Transformers. Not exactly the sort of person you wold want to hire to start your franchise. His bad writing skills really show in this movie.The movie starts with Russell Crowe giving us an exposition dump about the Mummy's backstory. Then we get an action scene with Tom Cruise. Thirdly, we get some exposition about Tom Cruise's backstory. Then we get some action when a plane crashes. Then we get some more exposition about the Mummy's backstory. Then we get some action when Tom Cruise fights the Mummy. Then we get an exposition dump by Russell Crowe when he explains the backstory of the Mummy to Tom Cruise. Then we gets some action when the mummy escapes, and Tom Cruise has to fight her. Then the movie end with one final exposition dump.Notice a pattern? Exposition, then action, then exposition. The mummy's backstory is explained three times over the course of the film. I'm sure even a five year old would understand the entire plot without much difficulty. They turned a simplistic story into a complete mess. And then they're hints of a cinematic universe which they keep teasing. As if anyone would want to watch a sequel after this debacle of a film.Tom Cruise's character is something we've seen a million times already. His love interest is equally generic. The only character who is somewhat interesting is Dr. Jekyll. However, he's simply there to provide exposition and to tease future films. I would much prefer a solo Dr. Jekyll film, although that's not likely to happen anytime soon.The Mummy is not even an accurate title. Tom Cruise fights the Mummy would be better. This movie focuses mostly on his character, which is probably due to the heavy involvement he had in the script. Dull, cliche and an absolute failure, the Mummy is a film you should steer clear off.",The Mummy

365,MovieSoup,"No one asked for this ""film"". God Awful",2,7 September 2017,"First I would just like to say that I loved the 1999 version of the mummy. It was fun, light-hearted and the performances by John Hanner and Rachel Weise were fantastic especially the love/ hate chemistry between Weise and Frasier. The plot was coherent, simple and a little bit camp which did not hurt things. Is it the best horror movie ever? No. But you can't say it isn't fun to watch. As you can imagine I was a bit apprehensive when the movie was being remade with tom cruise. My mom said ""it's going to be a completely different movie. Why be such a critical a*shole about a stupid mummy film"". So I sat down in the theatre with an open mind and oh god! I was willing to give it a chance!! I went in with an open mind but this ""film"" just took my money and in return gave me 1 hour 47 minutes of visual garbage. I hate this movie!It seems like the plot of this movie is trying to be two things, a remake of the old mummy films and a reboot of the film for a possible franchise. There are several scenes that are taken from the mummy shot for shot. The 1999 movie had the mummy trying to turn someone evil and the 2017 mummy tries to turn someone evil, that is the plot of both movies and they have no difference between them.The other plot point focuses on a chance to reboot the film and make a possible franchise from it..WHY??? This seems stupid considering how many different film franchises there are at the moment. MCU, DC universe, Star wars, Star trek, Friday 13th, Aliens.The list goes on.I am in no way saying that some of these are amazing franchises however how can this film compete with all of these? Answer: It just can't! I think they are trying to do a classic horror type flick with this and reading into it, it looks like universal are trying this expansion under something called the dark universal franchise. If so this film gets it off to a terrible start. With poor ratings this is the first and probably last dark universe film (hopefully. Please god) It is almost like the scrip writers just said ""Hey lets fling borrowed horror clichés and stupid ideas at this film and see what sticks"". The plot is not even scary. They just put in jump scares instead of making the characters genuinely scary like the 1999 film did. The director for this was also chief writer for the script. Including The Mummy (2017) He has other piles of cat sh*t to his name such as The Amazing Spiderman 2 (a film that made ME actually HATE Spiderman) and transformers 2 a film that won an award for being the most unintentionally racist film of 2009. Now I can't blame him for all problems with this movie however when you wrote a large portion of a scrip that is incomprehensible, flat and boring then you deserve to have a big portion of blame for all the bad press your crap film deserves to get. In no way is Tom Cruise the worst actor in this film but he is terrible. For the first half of the ""film"" he acts like he is trying to just do the character of Rick O'Connell from the first film. Tom cruise was great in rain man and risky business. In Top Gun he was definitely there.I saw him there. However in this movie he seems to be playing the same character he has been playing for years.Tom cruise. He does this with a lot of films he is in and it's quite clear that he is just in this movie to draw crowds of fans who like tom cruise. The girl who plays the mummy wasn't bad as she at least gave a sh** about what her character was going through. The worst actor by far in this movie is Annabelle Wallis. She has so little impact for me in this film that whilst writing this review I had to google the character's name that Wallis plays. Our first scene with her character has her taking over the mummy's tomb sight, which tom cruise found, and proclaiming that they should do so because she is an archaeologist and then ""lets slip"" that she banged Tom Cruise for no real reason. That whole scene destroys any sense of chemistry that the two of them could have had and just makes their attempts at romance in the rest of the film look forced. Every time I was watching the scenes with her in them I immediately thought of how much I missed Rachel Weiss in the 1999 mummy film. The chemistry Eve and Rick had was believable at least. The music is just generic horror movie music that falls flat and gives no emotional depth to the scenes. The colour of the movie is bland and dark even for a horror movie it is one of the blandest looking films I have seen lately.This movie's two biggest failures are its plot and the characters. We do not care about the characters and the plot spends so much time shamelessly building a franchise that it actively destroys the tone of the film. It is a movie no one asked for and I advise you to not watch this.",The Mummy
366,gurubesar,Banking on Tom Cruise,2,2 August 2017,"If you like to see Tom Cruise, you may like this movie. It's full of the action of Tom as in Mission Impossible, but nothing new. If you expect to see a story like the previous movies of Mummy, forget it, this is a completely different ball game. However, if you have something else better to do, do not waste your money on this movie. I gave a rating 2 out of respect for Tom Cruise. To begin with, the introduction of the story takes too long. Going all over the place from the Crusade to London and Iraq/Mesopotamia. To make it legit, the director seemed to remember that there was some armies who were shooting stone statue. Next come an woman who is an expert on the stone which so clean and fresh like she was just out from taking a long shower. I really must say that the costume designer of this movie has no idea what an female archaeologist should look like when they are dressed for work. Surely not with a long flowing hair and silk scarf plus some neat trousers. To make it more ridiculous, Tom Cruise is playing as an absent minded American troops, who seems to have his commanding officer under his thumb. This is really a disgrace for the US army. It is more confusing later when the archaeologist is actually working for a British officials. People would have thought that a US army will bring whatever they found to the US base, but not on this one. They carried the finding to the UK ? Why ? Can't they come up with a more logical story line ? If you want to destroy something bad, I would have thought that the most logical sense would be to destroy it when they found it. Why would somebody split the bad item in 2 and keep them separated ? It does not make sense, but then with a title ""The Mummy"", common sense does not work. On the other hand, please give the benefit that the viewers of the movie are not all the idiots who like to keep dangerous stuff as a memento. Despite all the hocus-pocus of powerful mummy that ""defy human comprehension"", the ending is very disappointing. Is it because the director or the screen-writer is already out of ideas ? I would have expected a bigger bang on the ending. Like I said at the beginning, the story line is so bad. I am very disappointed with Tom Cruise's acting. Annabelle Wallis is just like somebody who just started to act and all her expression are just dumb. If want to throw away $20 or $15 or whatever the cost of the ticket, just buy a lottery ticket. You might still have a chance to win. Watching this movie is a sure loss bet.",The Mummy
367,austinfromdahood,A terrible attempt to start a new movie universe,5,30 November 2018,"I think Tom Cruise is one of the best actors working today. Not necessarily because of his acting skills, but instead, his ability to perform amazing stunts. He climbed the burj Khalifa, he jumps between buildings, he climbs treacherous cliffs, and in the movie I'm reviewing today, he performed zero gravity stunts and dodged real explosives. 2017's The Mummy is a movie I'm mixed on. A part of me thinks it's a fun summer movie, and another part of me thinks the movie is a terrible startup to a new universe Universal Studios tried to create. I've watched this movie a handful of times, and I'm still conflicted with myself. Let's start with the pros of this movie. Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Russell Crowe are really good in this movie. Sofia Boutella especially is really good in this film as the main monster, the mummy itself. There are many great action sequences in this movie that really entertained me. The mythology of the mummy and its history in this movie intrigued me very much. Now let's dive into the cons of this movie. Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson are very weak characters in this movie. Annabelle Wallis is supposed to be the damsel in distress in this movie that gives exposition, and she wasn't an interesting character in this movie. Jake Johnson was the funny sidekick in this movie, and he was super annoying and barely gave good jokes. I found Tom Cruise's character to be funnier than Jake Johnson's character. This movie also resembled the original in ways, and that familiar feeling didn't make the film any better. Heck, the 1999 mummy and the 2017 mummy both have a sandstorm with a face in it. I recently got a 4k blu ray player and some 4k movies to match with my 4k TV, and my dad wanted to buy some 4k movies as well. He bought The Great Wall in 4K, which I heard isn't that good, and he bought The Mummy (2017) in 4K. He said he really enjoys these movies, and I just sighed in disappointment. This movie at times can be a fun summer movie, and at other times, a bloated movie that tries so hard to be original and fresh. I'd give The Mummy a 5/10",The Mummy

I couldn't wait to see it, even though I am not a Tom Cruise fan. It got my bum on the seat. And boy, did I feel ripped off! This movie has B-grade predictable drivel written all over it. The acting was over the top, the CGI was below par & plot was poor. Although the actress who played the mummy did a reasonable job, her henchmen were almost cartoonish. After watching a few seasons of The Walking Dead, I was totally unmoved by the supposed 'horror' of these zombies. Yeah, whatever! The creepy crawlies looked too fake - it was laughable. The semi- rehydrated mummy crawling her way along the ground looked amateurish & farcical. There is no excuse for bad computer graphics in this day & age. There was no suspenseful anticipation, no peeking through the fingers, not even a single gasp of shock or fear. Where was the music to build suspense? Bland, predictable, passé. The attempts at comedy fell flat. Tom Cruise was miscast. Russell Crowe's Jekyl & Hyde was so hammy & also distracted from the story. Added to introduce the character for another movie, I read. I won't be rushing to see that one either!One scene had Tom Cruise & his leading lady successfully outrunning imploding glass windows which conveniently shattered from the back windows to the front, in order mind you, rather than all at once. So believable. Not! There were quite a few 'oh, please!' moments - like the amount of time Nick Morton was able to swim underwater for example.The final scene suggests there might be a sequel. Please God, no! Just no.I get annoyed when a movie doesn't deliver on its promise. Give me Brendan Fraser's 1999 version of The Mummy any day - vastly superior & more enjoyable to watch.

375,kastenmeier-andreas,Dark Universe: First Entry,5,22 July 2017,"Tom Cruise is one of the last big movie stars, who manages to get people into the theaters even if the movie they're in isn't that great. That's the case with ""The Mummy"", although only half of the movie really is about said creature. The other part is focused on the establishing of Universals Dark Universe by introducing an agency lead by Russel Crowes Dr. Jekyll.A Universe that does not know whether to be funny, scary, thrilling or action-packed and instead of choosing decides to be all at once. Which is one of the biggest flaws of this movie. So you kind of get a mixed bag in every way. The mummy part also feels like we have seen everything before. Not even the charisma of Tom Cruise and the bad ass Sofia Boutella can help to save this mess of a movie.Watching every scene alone is kind of enjoyable, but in order they feel lifeless. Let's hope for a better future of the Dark Universe.",The Mummy
376,mukherjeediptendu,The Mummy is a bummer though quite enjoyable......,6,10 June 2017,"The Mummy is the first movie of the Universal Studio's Dark Universe.. It is quite enjoyable not so good of a movie...The movie starts with telling the back story of The Mummy Ahmanet and then them finding the mummy in a desert fight... From the start it the scenes the script the way of telling the story seems pretty average...The action in this movie are pretty good..The plane sequence is quite breathtaking.. There are some creepy horror moments in the 2nd act of the movie...The acting is good.. Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe delivered as always.. Annabelle Wallis is quite good.. Sofia Boutella is good as the mummy though she has not that much of dialogues...The character development is decent,it needed more... Russell Crowe Characters part in the movie who played Dr.Henry Jekyll is underwhelmingly used..Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis er characters relationship is quite same underdeveloped...The 1st act of the movie is pretty adventures... 2nd act is very good with some horror moments.. 3rd act is weakest as it is average chased by mummy's action flick specially the way this movie ends...The humors does not land very often...script is quite average... The directing is pretty good...As a whole it is quite enjoyable and it definitely the first movie of a cinematic universe more so than its own movie.. that's where the movie falters more...Although The Mummy is enjoyable worth checking but one time watchable.....6.4/10..........",The Mummy

378,jmarinko925,A popcorn flick and present day take on classic universal monster movie,7,12 July 2017,The Mummy was enjoyable and delivers as advertised. Aside from some forced humor I have no complaints of this movie. I found Russel Crowe's Dr. Jekyll particularly enjoyable in this film. It left me looking forward to the revamped Universal monster films. The story paced well with high powered effects and action and just enough horror to live to it's title.,The Mummy
379,drhall-672-138129,The Mummy of All Mummy Pics!,10,13 June 2017,"The Movie is non-stop action, great characters, funny and sexy. The story is just plain great fun. The script is back and forth / past and present due to Tom Cruise hosting the spirit of the entombed black princess! What's so overdone about that? Nothing! Its great fun, it's sexy and surprising at every turn! C'mon people, this is by far the most action packed fun Mummy of the franchise. Tom's love interest Jenny - Annabelle Wallis is reminding me of National Treasure and Nick Cage shenanigans, again with sexy professor lady. Get it? Kudos to director Alex Kurtzman - in fact Big Applause! Especially nice scene featuring the forest escape from ""BlackHeart"" by the Russell Crowe Doctor Henry Jekyll. Forget the panning reviews - trust me this is truly a remarkable script with surprising plot twists. Jennifer you little turncoat research scientist? I like the Princess capture scene where Jenny gets talky talky while all chained up and ready for mercury embalming by Russell Crowe. You have been selected ... oh wow, go see this jewel for yourself, then check back with me. Who you gonna believe me or THEM???",The Mummy
380,tor-claesson,"Somewhat miscast, but still entertaining",7,15 July 2017,"I think Tom Cruise is a quite a descent actor, but I feel that he was miscast for his role in this movie. Not that he couldn't portray a thieving grave robber given the proper chance, , but he's not given any. At least not in a way which I think is suitable for him. In my opinion Cruise is at his best in slower scenes, where he's allowed to act, but there are none of those in this movie. Instead the director goes for sped up scenes, with the dialogue quickly dished out without much acting at all - and this makes Cruise look out of place. Almost as if the movie is played on fast forward, but he's not. It's awkward. But I blame the director and the casting crew, not Cruise.Besides of that I think The Mummy is a pretty entertaining summer flick. Not as great as the Brendan Fraiser-movies I loved as a teen, but still descent enough. The female mummy is great; I love mean women. And although most of the plot is quite predictable I was happily surprised with the ending. I did not see it coming, and I liked it.Looking forward to a second installment of some kind. Hopefully a slightly slower paced second installment with a few action scenes less and a bit more acting on between.",The Mummy
381,barrelhousegutboy,Not your Mommy's Mummy,7,10 August 2017,"I put off seeing this flick because of how hard its being panned. I have made this mistake before, and kick myself for being led astray once again. Lets start with what this movie isn't. Its not going to win an Oscar (yeah I know, big deal). There are no warm fuzzies or spiritual awakenings. Its unlikely to ever find itself on a 'must see' list. Despite my efforts to find them there are no tasty quotable lines. Overly complex character development, plot elements, back story or side stories. Okay so now that you know you won't need a towel, holy vestments, witty rejoinder, or Einstein's big juicy brain lets get into what this movie is. Fast paced- while not at a sprint after the set up you won't have time to go get a snack. A full box- yes indeed they cover a lot of ground in setting up the franchise without being redundant or requiring people to ask the audience around them just what the hell is going on. Satisfying- my final judgment on whether a movie justifies the price of admission is how likely I would be to hit the pause button if I were watching at home and I have to say my attention didn't wander. I did enjoy the Werewolf of London parallel (one of the great movies of the past) and noticed several places where somebody's movie preferences earlier in life are apparent. But just as I don't hold such things against musicians, I don't hold them against directors. So overall what you have is the sponge for future movies, laid out in a very broad easy to follow manner (unlike Kong:Skull Island where you needed a decoder ring). Personally I like to watch movies for what they are instead of what they aren't, if we have that in common there is no reason to expect you will find anything other than 120 minutes or so of easy entertainment that isn't going to leave you too worn out to go for ice cream after. If you wanted high drama you wouldn't have picked the flick with the flashy poster.",The Mummy
382,Moonstrike9,The movie is enjoyable if you pretend you're in the 90's and lower your standards XD,7,17 August 2017,"But the dialogue seriously lacked. There were several scenes where Cruise's character and his character's friend just yelled moronic statements into the ether. There was even a scene where Cruise just said ""I've got a plan"" like a bajillion times for comic relief, but it was so dumb and went so flat I just rolled my eyes right there on the spot. The director seriously needs to consider his life choices, and so does Cruise for that matter, if he read the script and left it that way. Also the friend character was useless and dead for most of the film. His character just didn't seem to mesh with the movie, and perhaps the movie would have been better if the director hadn't put him and his lame jokes in. Overall though, the best character and actor in the whole film was Sofia Boutella. She was creepy, she was evil and ruthless, and she was good at it. The only weak thing was her motivation and backstory. It seemed really flimsy, but well...subpar director strikes again. Really, the movie had a lot of potential, and you can see it. It's just a crummy director and an A-list actor who didn't realize that he was in a different genre from his usual Bond- esque movies. I really hope the Dark Universe gets picked up by a far better director, if Universal decides to continue the project. And I hope they drop Cruise. Leave him in his action films, he doesn't belong in the Horror genre. Russel Crowe, though, I really want to see his Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie.",The Mummy
383,gardeniapalms,Really Wanted To Like It,1,17 September 2018,"Having seen ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff and then ""The Mummy"" films with Brendan Fraser, I felt I had a handle on what to expect from a film with that classic monster. But this version...what the heck was Universal thinking?The premise had no bearing on the legendary monster other than it being an old entity being used as an instrument of gore. The plot felt contrived giving the actors no place to go. It came off as being more a movie for Tom Cruise to strut around than it was a movie about one of the world's greatest monsters.To be honest, we couldn't finish it...we turned it off at about the halfway point when we realized we just didn't care about any of the characters. I know what they were wanting but I think Universal may have killed their own ""Monster Universe"" before it gathered any real footing...and that's sad.",The Mummy
384,jackson-regurge,The Mummy Report!,7,11 June 2017,"When I first heard about the remake of the beloved 90's classic: The Mummy I was sceptical, but after seeing the first trailer I knew that the franchise was on its way in a fresh and more modern direction. The film stars Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis and Sofia Boutella. The acting in the film is compelling and with a professional such as Cruise I would expect nothing less. The film even stars Russell Crowe as Dr Henry Jekyll which is a fitting addition in a film filled with ghouls and monsters. Alex Kurtzman did a good job in directing the introductory movie into the 'Dark Universe' – which will be Universal's addition to the on screen cinematic universes. Kurtzman brilliantly combined elements of the horror genre with the action genre to give audiences a really fun and well paced flick. The use of special effects can often overshadow the story in films like these, but I was pleasantly surprised as all the effects used help to further the plot and look really impressive. Overall, I am excited to see what happens next in the story and I also look forward to seeing how Universal continues to expand their cinematic universe. I would give the film 7 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone longing for the monster films of old with a modern twist.",The Mummy
385,xoxo411,Mythical Romantic Tragedy,7,9 June 2017,"The movie starts like usual Tom Cruz Style but bit slow. Accidentally he falls prey to the spells of the evil beauty and then the story line picks up. Great acting by sexy sofia. Her figure, the tattoos, her facial expressions as a princess and later as a evil monster are exemplary. The heroine is a truly charming Annabelle is a beauty that one falls in love immediately.Good choice of the director. The hero Tom Cruz finally had to do true sacrifice that sets for yet other Mummy Series to come in the future and I am expecting those future movies to be far more thrilling than this introductory piece. Can't wait for it. Supporting actors in lead roles like Crow, Johnson and many more have done a great job. Viscous but also sad in a waybut also true to the mythical ideology. I thought it was a great movie and a different kind of movie creation for Tom Cruz. I give it a 7.0",The Mummy

It's as political as Snopes now.Anyway, got back from seeing this. It was okay. I felt like the whole Dr. Jekyl bit was unnecessary because it added nothing to the story and took away from Ahmanet, who is EASILY the highlight of this film. My personal feelings about Sofia Boutella aside (re: rare celebrity crush), she absolutely slays it as the titular mummy. There's not enough of her in the film, which is where it falls flat for me. More of her doing demonic mummy stuff would've elevated this film from ""meh"" to ""hell yeah"". As anyone who has seen Kingsmen knows, she can express a lot with her movement and she continues to impress here. While the rest of the cast does a good job acting their parts, I feel like they don't bring anything to their roles, at least not as well as Sofia. I feel like anyone could be switched out in those roles and it wouldn't make much of a difference.I think it would've been better if they had revealed Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll at the end in a post- credits sequence (as movie universe films are wont to do) instead of taking up a good chunk of the movie and the SFX budget. At any rate, it was a decent film and NOT worse than Baywatch as Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe. That's a travesty to compare these two films. Of course, one film could be seen as ""misogynistic"" and we all know how that's infiltrated films these days, but RT has lost all credibility as a movie review site now.",The Mummy

I later found out it was the opening installment for a new cinematic universe for Monsters etc. Now here was the huge mistake. This being the opening installment is bad. Since this is the first part of the upcoming movies, it needs more working and concentration in order to catch our attention for the upcoming series. Instead the script is just written with little attention and this has already driven away fans for the upcoming installments. I think if they want the dark universe to flourish, then next time the plot and writing of the movie should be given more attention. Action scenes are created for no reason and the movie felt rushed. The bridge which unveiled the mummy into existence was rushed. How Tom Cruise and the mummy met was also forced. The story totally changed to something else instead of Concentrating more on the mummy's aim. I just hope the upcoming movies will get more attention to the plot. Also I think the role Tom Cruise played did not fit him perfectly. Tom Cruise is more of the kick ass type not a run away adventurer.",The Mummy

The first half, which is not entirely bad, where the classical mummy adventure is told with some new ideas, and the second half which is mostly a messy prologue to all the future films that Universal hoped to make. But it is all wasted. This film will never ever be the start of a Universal cash cow like Marvel.Its a shame though, because without such a bad second half it could probably have been a passable film. Even though Tom Cruise is at least 15 years too old to play first lover and every awkward joke feels at least twice as awkward when he is taking part in it. Obvious miscast.",The Mummy

But the action scenes were full on, well choreographed, with Cruise yet again delivering an outstanding physical performance, and Boutella with her sensual and athletic abilities giving the best evil 'Mummy' performances in the franchise.For a lazy Sunday flick The Mummy provides all the brain numbing action and comedy that is required.",The Mummy

397,hamjag,What did you do...?!?!,4,16 June 2017,"To say I was looking forward to The Mummy (2017) is a huge understatement. I went to my local theatre, and sat ready, without friends or popcorn, to limit distraction.And then, just a few minutes in, I knew I was set for disappointment. Its difficult to explain why the opening monologue was so poor, but all it did was set the scene, badly. A primary reason was the spoken word - recently, there has been a backlash against actors whose speech cannot be understood,(Bain in The Dark Knight Rises being a good example), but this film goes too far the other way. All the actors spoke so clearly it sounded artificial.The movie runs at a reasonable pace and the huge budget is quite clear to see throughout. Unfortunately there are some quite obvious plot holes and continuation errors that stand out, like, a dead person whose eyes between shots open and close frequently.Don't get me wrong, the movie has everything one would expect from a blockbuster - a great cast, good plot a big budget, Unfortunately, when it fails to deliver the blame must be placed on the director, Alex Kurtzman. Alex is a very good producer, but maybe this was a step too far or too soon. All the bits are there but something, I guess the X-factor, that Hollywoods greatest directors seem to find, is missing.This is the first of what is being billed as the 'Dark Universe' series of movies, and though The Mummy ends with a decent 'oh, whats next...', I would very much hope the other movies are much better put together.I always stay to the end, just in case there are any crazy credits, but my disappointment was so great, I had to just leave...",The Mummy

The movie follows the tried and tested formula of lovable rogue vs sexy baddie, love interest is not all she seems. The special effects are excellent the small twists although a bit predictable help the story move along at a good pace.

But in fairness, I did get much farther in it than I did in that Egyptian Gods stinker.I am speaking of the newest ""Mummy"" with Tom Cruise. I liked the twist that this mummy was female and was chasing down her reincarnated male lover. There, I found something good to say. Oh, and the special effects were... modern. CG is now at the point where great effects should be a given, no longer worthy of praise. So I guess I still only found one good thing to say.The plot was constrained by the formula, so it had to rely on two twists to be fresh. One twist, mentioned, was good. The other was horrible. Russel Crowe is in the movie as... Dr. Henry Jekyll. He is the leader of the good guys trying to imprison the mummy, who is evil incarnate. Can you guess who Jekyll becomes if he does not get his regular shot?One funny thing that made me really laugh hard. This Dr. Jekyll has one hand in a glove, like Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove. And it is that hand that starts to ""go bad"" when Mr. Hyde begins to appear. So of course, the shots go into the hand before Jekyll loses control of it. ""Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!""Sensing that this was likely to be the best part of the movie, I thought to stop there. But that morbid curiosity made me hang in there to watch the Hyde appearance (weak), and the inevitable escape of evil incarnate from its bounds (predictable).I think I have about 20 minutes left to watch. Maybe I will finish it up before GoT tonight, sort of like a bad warm up band before the headliner.So bad it is good? Almost, but not quite. A complete stinker? Also not quite... if you have a morbid sense of humor like I have. Otherwise you might think it is indeed complete.",The Mummy

Still we watch more, in the hope it would improve. This was not to be,2 hours of our lives we'll never get back.The bimbo mummy goes around making people into zombie like creatures. Then, Dr. Henry Jekyll? Why not Frankenstein too?I am surprised Crowe had anything to do with this. He can't be that hard up for money?

Russell Crowe did an alright accent for a change and Jake Johnson did a brilliant comedic performance so did Tom Cruise by the way.It's just the plot i didn't get.

402,Reznik_T,"Enjoyable, but with many flaws",6,3 August 2017,"This movie was much-much better than what I expected after all the negative reviews, but I also understand the low ratings, because The Mummy has a lot of issues.First the positives: 1. Tom Cruise. I think his acting and comic timing is what holds the movie together, primarily. His performance in this reminded me of the first Jack Reacher movie, which I liked a lot (not surprisingly Christopher McQuarrie, the director of Jack Reacher, was one of the writers for this one). 2. The humour. The tone of the movie, especially the first hour was very similar to the 1999 Mummy, and it worked for me for the most part. I especially liked Tom's chemistry with his sidekick (Jake Johnson), who strangely disappeared for the second act, and then reappeared for the last 30 minutes or so. 3. Sofia Boutella. She was amazing, absolutely menacing and scary as the mummy.4. The action and the special effects were really good throughout the film. You can tell they put a lot of effort in it.As far as the negatives go, by the second half of the movie it becomes very convoluted, hard to follow, as they tried to cram in way too many subplots (this being the first installment of the ""Dark Universe"" franchise), and the tone wasn't consistent either. The writing and the editing is flawed, especially in the first half an hour, and then in the last act as well. (UPDATE: Upon rewatch I gotta say the story makes sense, you just need to pay close attention to able to follow it.)All in all, The Mummy is far from perfect, but still a pretty enjoyable movie that I recommend.",The Mummy
403,visureigis,"Expected better, much better movie",4,1 August 2017,"When Brendon Fraiser is by far the better lead than Tom Cruise, it spells a huge problem from the get go. Cruise played himself, as he always does, but with ever increasing ego and decreasing capability to pull off ""superhero"" role.Then we have (surprisingly) bad CGI, special effects from nearly two decades ago looked better (and with a 45 mln. smaller budget). Cruise's CGI looked cheap, worse than seen on numerous TV shows nowadays, and if you noticed - almost always in the dark, to further decrease expenses. Then what Universal and Cruise have done with 125 mln.? Certainly not salaries or CGI or script. Whats left, money laundering?No humour whatsoever (unless we consider Cruise getting ass kicked as funny, which sometimes was), and if extremely annoying Chris Vail character was suppose to be a comic relief... A massive fail on both writing and casting. Rachel Weisz had a character with some substance, she pulled off her role. Mrs. Wallis was just eye candy, nothing more, nothing less. At least Sofia Boutella was casted well.Bottom line, if you haven't seen this movie yet - don't waste your time and money. Rewatch previous Mummies, and you will enjoy much more.",The Mummy

I understand the problems wholly and don't want to tell you they aren't bad, I just think they were as criminal as most blockbusters.The script needed a rewrite due to off dialogue and hazy explanations of plot points. The movie also could've been severely trimmed. It would have been much better at just an hour and a half.What worked is that you had a good sense of the goal and the events leading there. Again, not perfectly executed, but there was substantial cohesion. They do hit the Dark Universe setup and it isn't necessary but it doesn't derail the film. Russel Crowe played his part quite well making it enjoyable. On the other hand, Tom Cruise is sometimes given some odd one liners, but aside, he pulls off a fun action hero.The best aspect, for me, was the tone. They work in lots of creepy imagery laid in passable action scenes giving a fresh feel which was enjoyable to watch.The movie is by no means great, but all the reviews tanked my expectations so low that I continuously found myself pleasantly surprise.",The Mummy
410,hollywoodhernandez-70868,Hollywood just starts over with The Mummy,5,8 June 2017,"In the new version of The Mummy Hollywood once again shows us that when a franchise runs out of steam all you have to do is rewind and recast the movie and start all over again. The Mummy franchise had been getting steadily worse over the past few years, finally becoming a direct to DVD movie with The Scorpion King, but the Mummy (2017) makes a strong comeback with the new version staring Tom Cruise.Cruise, who made his bones as an action star in the Mission Impossible series, does a great job with the action scenes in this reboot and delivers a fine sense of humor that entertains during the slow parts of the movie while we wait for the next big round of action. Sofia Boutella is the bad girl mummy who's awakened from her eternal rest and who is hell bent on releasing the evil she has been denied during her long slumber. She haunts Nick's (Cruise) dreams with her visions of making him her sacrifice and taking her evil into all eternity with him by her side. Annabell Wallis is the female Egyptologisit who travels the world helping to prevent the evil from getting loose and Russell Crowe is the corrupt Dr. Henry Jekyll (no joke) who's the head of the ghost busting agency who has some special plans for the female mummy. The Mummy has a some incredible visual effects and enough action and humor to be entertaining but it's not a great movie. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" (which I rate by the popcorn sizes SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE and JUMBO) The Mummy rates a MEDIUM. It has a run time of 1 hour and 50 minutes and it's rated PG-13.

Though it may have some faults in the first and third act, The Mummy makes a solid start to a potentially great franchise by being one thing first, a complete movie with a beginning and end. Most franchise starters nowadays try to shove weak setups for future sequels down viewers' throats as seen in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Ghostbusters (2016) but this movie does not do the same. It uses a rich cast, fun script, memorable action, and a beautiful score by Brian Tyler to give another fun action-adventure popcorn flick that rises above the rest.",The Mummy

418,SmashandNasty,"Not worth the 107 minutes of your life. But, you're basically going to have to watch it if Universal actually goes through with this ""Dark Universe"" universe.",3,12 June 2017,"Our take: Not worth the 107 minutes of your life. But, you're basically going to have to watch it if Universal actually goes through with this ""Dark Universe"" universe. Post credit scene? No.If you're a fan of the original 1999 Mummy movies, go watch those because this will not satisfy you. This movie can be summed as Mission Impossible but with: 100% more zombies, 100% more mummies and almost, maybe, set near (?) Egypt (for awhile?).It's a rather shaky start to a franchise we are getting whether we like it or not. It lacked the charm that the 1920's setting and Brenden Fraser's effortless charisma lent the original reboot. But even if you step back from that romp with a mummy, you're still left with a bad taste in your mouth.Truthfully, it was just not a good movie: poorly written, poorly paced, poorly cast, and poorly conceived. The barely-there plot was strung together by long expositional monologues, unnecessary action scenes, zombie attacks, and the occasional bit of comic relief that was often forced and less relieving than it is annoying. Nobody in this movie seems to have chemistry with anybody else and it's hard to decide whether it was a casting issue or a writing issue, though we will give them the benefit of the doubt and just assume that it was both.We were excited to see a female mummy, but another disappointment awaited us. Ahmanet is little more than an over-sexualized, often nude, otherwise scantily clad higher-budget version of Suicide Squad's Enchantress (with less hip swaying and fancy light shows). And in a step back for female action heroes everywhere, both she and the pretty, well-read Egyptologist Jennifer are both pining after and actively pursuing Nick, whose character not only has none of the charm of Fraser's Rick O'Connell, he is outwardly terrible, blatantly misogynistic, has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and naturally gets the girl anyway. Though to note, it does technically pass the Blechdel Test.For all of the things that it got wrong, I will say that there were no plot holes (minus the science and history aspects). This is an impressive feat for any movie, but it was exceptionally impressive for a movie that was otherwise riddled with issues. The baseline for the franchise was well-set, and I hope that they can learn from their mistakes moving forward, because it is a franchise I'd really like to see succeed.Featuring: An Avengers-esque franchise launch, linked together by a Nick Fury- esque Dr. Jeykll who works at a S.H.I.E.L.D-esque secret facility for monsters and evil things. (And an excellent performance from Russell Crowe as our favorite dissociative monster/man.)Also featuring: Jake Johnson being amazing. But sadly in the wrong movie. His character didn't fit and was just a pile of awkward, but he brought a smile to our faces every time he came on the screen.",The Mummy
419,emu81684,"""Meh"" is a Compliment",3,9 October 2019,"This movie is, genuinely, just ""meh"". There's nothing special about it because it was all driven into the ground. The idea could have been amazing. Sofia Boutella was the only reason I wanted to see this movie because her makeup was amazing, and I like her as an actress, but Tom Cruise Tom-Cruised the hell out of it. Look, I like the guy, but there's a point where studios, directors, and writers should just sit back and think ""is he really right for this?""There's little to no chemistry between Nick (Tom Cruise) and Jenny (Annabelle Wallis). Jenny doesn't even serve a purpose. Nick would have unleashed the monster without her and he secret evil-fighting society would have found him and used him without her. They tried to force some kind of romantic relationship between the two, but when the characters are first introduced, she's berating him for stealing from her after a one-night stand. And yet, but the end of the movie, his ""love"" of her was what helped him stay human. Really?But, I can generally forgive stuff like that. It's a movie. You're supposed to suspend belief. I think what I have the biggest problem was the unnecessary CGI. Not the sand storms or the army of insects/rodents that attack, I mean the CGI done to people's faces for no reason. Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) spends roughly half her time as a mummy with a strange CG mask on. There's like a strange sort of filter they used on the whole of her face, not just the bits that they tried to make rotten. Even after she's whole again, it looks as though they tried to soften her features, and render the marks as well as her eyes when practical makeup could have worked just fine.There's more bad CGI when Nick is turned. Again, the eyes, when I'm sure contacts, while uncomfortable, could've saved a few million for that single scene. And Vail (Jake Johnson) has a wonky CGI'd eye, too. One is a milky contact, and the other one is rendered to be droopy. It was all just entirely unnecessary and was REALLY hard to ignore once noticed.All in all, the movie was bland. It's no different than any other Tom Cruise movie where he runs, stuff explodes, and the fate of the world rests on his shoulders. Literally the only Tom Cruise cliche they didn't use was, he didn't ride a motorcycle. Other than that, this could be copy and pasted from one of a dozen of his other movies. It's disappointing because, like I said, it had potential.",The Mummy
420,HeirOfDorne,"Solid Movie, Bad Title",6,30 September 2017,"First off, everyone giving this movie a 1 star rating is reacting to to the fact that they either expected a 10/10 or went in wanting to hate it. The Mummy offers good acting, special effects, and an effective story-line. The only ""problem"" with the movie is its title. Just by associating itself with the Mummy title you go back expecting it to the Brandon Frasier title that we all love. ""Curse of Ahmanet"" or something similar would have been a more effective title. The other area of improvement is the run-time. By today's blockbuster standards this is a relatively short movie, clocking in under 2hrs. There were areas that could have been expanded, such as detailing the life of Ahmanet in ancient times. I would like it if the story continued through sequels, as there is more that can be explored with the content. I'm not talking about other ""Dark Universe"" movies. What would enhance this movie further would be the development of characters/plots through a direct sequel. It is an entertaining title, but could have been improved through more character development and better use of a beautiful Egyptian setting.",The Mummy
421,wildhunt1-585-849528,Great Start to the Dark Universe,9,9 June 2017,"The Mummy was a lot better than I was expecting. It was about WHAT I was expecting, which is good, and didn't really feel like it was doing nothing but universe-building. There was a bit of that, but they did focus mostly on the Mummy, Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis).This was your basic Mummy story, though they gave enough of a different background to Ahmanet to at least PARTIALLY distinguish her from previous Mummies. She was going to become the most powerful princess in the world until her father knocked up his new wife who bore him a son. Ahmanet was not going to have any of that, so she killed everyone. She sold her soul to Set, who promised to make her a Queen in exchange for giving him a physical form. Her father's soldiers capture her and mummify her alive.Skip to present day where Nick Morton is looking to make some money by breaking into a tomb on a map he stole from Jenny. She catches up to him just after he finds the tomb, and they explore it together. They find Ahmanet's tomb and accidentally revive her. Ahmanet decides Nick will be her new Chosen One--the new body for Set--and that brings Nick to the attention of Prodigium, a group dedicated to studying and destroying monsters.The cast of the Mummy was very good. Tom Cruise was still Tom Cruise, but as he manages to do in all his movies, he manages to sell it very well. Annabelle Wallis played a decent Jenny Halsey, and while I think she COULD have been a little bit stronger in her role, she was not a weak, wilting wallflower. She kicked as much butt as Tom Cruise did. But the real joy of this movie was Sofia Boutella as Ahmanet, a role she almost seemed born to play. She played sexy well, and she played psychotic well, and the people in charge of makeup turned her into a really excellent Mummy.The Mummy was also a beautiful movie. They did not overdo the cinematography, keeping it very grounded, but they didn't make anything unnecessarily dark just because. The special effects were great, and they did not do anything unnecessary. probably the biggest CGI scene was a scene in London that lasted maybe five minutes. And there was NO CGI-heavy ending fight like has been happening in movies a lot lately. They seemed to try to keep CGI out as much as they could, which was very refreshing. They still used it, don't get me wrong, but it didn't seem to be EVERYWHERE. The movie moved along at a brisk pace, didn't drag anywhere, and the sets and costumes were fabulous.I was very happy with the Mummy. I didn't expect a lot, so I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. Not everyone is going to like it, though, but I'm a big Universal Monster fan, and I can't wait to see what they do with their upcoming movies. I just hope there are upcoming movies considering the bad reviews this movie is getting, which it really does not deserve.",The Mummy
422,adean81,The Mummy Review,4,17 August 2017,"While I heard bad things about this movie, I decided to go ahead and watch it for myself. And I can tell you now, it's not a good movie. Now it's not terrible, but it's not very good. While the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies are not great, they are still fun, cheesy, action-adventure movie. There are a few elements of horror in those movies, they know what they are and horror they are not. This new Tom Cruise Mummy movie wants to be a horror/action movie and doesn't succeed in either.There are many things wrong with this movie, first is simply the plot of the story. It's not good. The movie does not explain anything until about half way through the movie when you don't even care anymore. I still don't know what the mummy's motivation was or what her powers were. It expects the audience to put the pieces together on their own, without really giving them any pieces to work with. The ending doesn't explain anything!Another problem is the relationship between Tom Cruise's character Nick and his love interest Jenny. There is no chemistry between the actors, and it makes it really hard to care about their relationship and the ending where it's supposed to be this big touching moment. At that point, I just don't care, there is more chemistry with Nick and the Mummy. Speaking of the mummy, *SPOLIERS* the movie decides to interrupt your mummy movie to bring Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and not in a good way. The last thing is that the tone of the movie is off balance. It wants to have these horror moments and action pieces, but it inserts terrible dialogue and moments of comedy that don't fit with the scene. Not to mention some moments that are supposed to be ""scary"" just seem silly. If you're going in for a horror movie, you might end up with a comedy.Now is there anything good about the movie? Eh, it looks good, some of the visual effects are awesome. There's even a cool call back to the Brendan Fraser movies with the giant mummy face in a sand storm. Unfortunately, that's about it, and this movie does not give audiences hope or excitement about Universal Studios ""Dark Universe"", essentially the classic movie monsters. This is not a monster movie and hopefully, the studio can fix that problem before releasing their next monster movie. If you're curious about the movie, then check it out, otherwise, it's a pass.",The Mummy
423,California_Girl_2058,Not Recommended for Children thru 16 Years of Age,7,14 June 2017,"The Mummy (2017) definitely should have been rated an ""R"" because of nudity and sexual positions throughout this film. You see a guy without his shirt, laying down and the woman is on top of him (she's wearing a scanty outfit) and it is pretty obvious what they are doing. They play back this scene a few times, throughout the movie. Compared to Brendan Fraser ""Mummy""-grossing $416 million worldwide, this new version of the ""Mummy"" is just awful! There were no funny guys in this movie. I missed Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) and Jonathan (the Librarian's brother) in Fraser's Version of the Mummy, those guys were hilarious! This new version of the Mummy's funny attempts were NOT funny at all. When the guys got the life sucked out of them, like the previous ""Mummy"" they didn't die but became Zombies. I hate Zombie movies, they give me nightmares! The Script JUST HAD TOO MANY sensuous scenes throughout the movie. The Mummy Woman is supposed to be buried for 5,000 years so how come she is wearing TONS of makeup? Did she run down to the store and buy makeup or what? Do the producers take us for idiots to believe women just wake up with makeup or what? The blonde woman, towards the end is in the water with her jacket on, she comes up out of the water without her jacket, leaving a low-cut blouse so she can be more provocative? Moms and Dads don't let your innocent children or teens through 16 of age, go see this movie. It is NOT appropriate for their minds to be filled with indecent exposures.

There a few scenes where the viewer almost feels as if he/she is really inside the movie... I guess the movies lacks for two reasons, story line seems undeveloped, and what made the mummy a fresh breed were special effects, and this one while on a newer era, the special effects don't live up to the expectations to make up for the story... However, Tom Cruise was great, seems to not age, and delivers a light refreshing representation... comic punch lines are good too... Other than that, most components of the movies are 5 to 6 average.

This is a question we have since asked ourselves.Anyway,A Pharaoh has a daughter called Princess Ahmanet and she is an only child and is set to be Pharoahette when daddy dies. But there is life in the old boy yet, and he fills a second wife with arms and legs and a penis (it's a BOOYYY!). This being ancient Egypt and boys taking precedence, Princess Ahmanet is onnaouter, and will be forced to live a simple life of luxury and privilege. But she wants to be Pharaoh! Mind you, Cleopatra was a pharaoh. And Hatshepsut. So was Khentkaus I.Princess Ahmanet is cross and bitter about her lot, and makes a deal with Set (possibly played by a resurrected L. Ron Hubbard) who gives her a nasty-looking knife to kill daddy and his new wife and her baby and also her boyfriend who will be reborn as Set/ L. Ron Hubbard. He also gives her some smart body-art. She's going alright having killed everyone except her boyfriend when she's captured and wrapped in bandages and embalmed in mercury. Seems fair. Crusaders find the knife.Her crypt is discovered by an Army-ranger-come-grave-robber played by Tommy Cruise. He has a lovable sidekick but I don't remember his name. Anyway Tom shoots him three times.A mysterious and clandestine group of mystic archaeologists headed by Dr Jekyll take control of the mummy. The good Dr still has significant anger management issues. The mystic archaeologist's brief is to keep the world safe from ancient demons. Tom dies in a plane crash. We got up to walk out but the lights stayed off so we sat down again.Dr Jekyll is played by New Zealander and Souths supporter, Rusty Crowe. Just when he thought it couldn't get any worse....Ahmanet reanimates herself by sucking the life out of first responders and passers-by but is captured by Jekyll and his mystic archaeologists, who include the Cruiser's love interest. Tom gets better! They (the archaeologists) pump her (Ahmanet) full of mercury again, but LO!, the magic knife is found and this perks her up and she vomits up the mercury and breaks her shackles and creates some crusader zombies.Her mission is to kill Tom (again) with the magic knife and he will be reborn, (again!), as Set and she (Ahmanet) and he (Set) will live happily ever after. The rest of us are PMF. Does she succeed? No. I only tell you that to save you from having to watch the movie. The monsters aren't very scary, the sidekick isn't very funny. The mummy is cute enough but nowhere near mean enough and wears disappointingly strategic bandages. Rusty looks as though Souths have just been pantsed. And it's got Tom Cruise.

Why? 1) So contrived it makes the word contrived sound.. contrived! There is really nowhere else to go for Hollywood if they wanted to make a movie any more contrived - even if they were actually scientifically trying to make the most contrived movie ever made. 2) It was like a low-budget movie on a high budget:i) - low budget and painfully weak scriptii) - low budget level acting and actors (Sorry Tom, your acting is now ranked alongside low budget level). iii) - low budget gags that were so poor and.. contrived that it confused the movies intended style instead of solidifying it. 3) Mis-cast Tom Cruise was cheese on toast with a big smiley face sprayed on with spray cheese on top of it. His cute boy act has got to end, he is looking good for his age but this in itself is really starting to creep me out. 4) The 'Mummy' was just boring, no fear factor, not menacing, nor mysterious,.. at one point she says ""times were different back then"" or something equally meaningless, a western expression that sounds like it was written by a 15 year old kid for his school homework. Just no intelligence or cultural / historical context for the character. 5) The jokey Iraq opening scenes must be an insult to anyone who has served there and witnessed the horror of combat in real life, whereas here it is placed as some sort of continual gag; ""lets call in airstrikes"".. errr what? You are bandit style archaeologists, American tourists can just call in body shattering, life obliterating and bloody air- strikes anywhere they see fit?! What is this, a gag from Tropical Thunder?! Oh, Americans own the planet right? I forgot, Jeeez-uhzzz.. 6) His friend tries to kill him under some sort of temporary spell and then later tries to chat with him in the toilets about stuff,.. such an obvious rip-off of American Werewolf in London, only with ZERO conviction in the character (take a look at Griffin Dunne playing Jack and shouting ""DAVID!"" in American Werewolf i.L, its unnerving and stays with you for a lifetime) Here it is just like looking at a plate of depressing processed food in a worn out chain restaurant and you secretly want to get out of there before eating one bite,.. just.. enough already. 7) NO originality AT ALL. Why cant they just employ some talent to direct stuff like this? Why does it have to be by the numbers all the time? 8) What Tom Cruise does at the end had me looking around at other peoples faces to see if they had the same look of incredulous pain etched on their faces. Anyone can be a God you just have to stab yourself with the right knife, oh, give me-a-break! 9) Knights of huge historical consequence buried, lay in wait for 900 odd years, in London just to fail at chasing Tom Cruise, then... errr.. just disappear into dust? 10) The Mummy catches up with Cruise on several occasions and just decides not to stab him with the goofy knife whilst she has the chance? First she lets him get away in the water, then moments later she has him in her hands with the knife about to strike but thinks, I know, I will throw him instead. I will give him multiple CONTRIVED chances to find a new weapon to fight back every time he lands, but just keep throwing him until, oh, he said something nasty to me, I wasn't expecting that, that distracted me, i will throw him extra hard this time, .. oh no,.. he has the knife now.. poo! 11) do you need more than 10, I proved my point.. I am a god-like reviewer and you will all be my servants in the next world unless you hit the button that indicates you thought this was 'Useful'... ""Useful""? How contrived can you get. There is nothing useful about reading other peoples reviews unless it confirms how you already feel.",The Mummy
436,kingramze,"Tom Cruise - Antiquities Thief... oh, and a Mummy",6,10 July 2017,"This incarnation of ""The Mummy"" solicits no sympathy from the audience. She brings the curse upon herself intentionally for selfish reasons. There's no clear explanation as to why that was necessary to obtain her goals, nor the consequences of her not completing a ritual.Cruise takes up the majority of the screen time, and his character only serves as a target for the Mummy -- though there's no explanation given as to why the Mummy couldn't target someone else or even what exactly the consequences are of her catching or never catching him.Other characters are brought in to tie into the upcoming Dark Universe movies, but they serve little purpose in the film other than to act as shadowy agents that know about dangers such as the Mummy. They take a page or two out of Hellboy here, but it's just dropping hints of a larger world we'll see in later movies.Mostly the movie is chase scenes, fight scenes, and poor attempts at humor. There's some semblance of a plan the Mummy has and some hand- waving at plans to prevent her from succeeding, but the movie is mostly action and chase scenes without much tension, horror, or suspense. I didn't even get the sense that there was a time frame for stopping the Mummy or for the Mummy to capture the ""hero.""I much prefer the first Brendon Fraser Mummy. He was a cursed star- crossed lover of a princess, rises and steals parts from people to make himself whole, then tries to conjure the spirit of his beloved into the body of another using a book of spells... and there's a real sense of danger, horror, and suspense. There's tension in that time is running out for the heroes to translate a different book of spells to defeat him in time.This movie was not a BAD film. It was disappointing because it was a missed opportunity, but I did enjoy the film. It was good, but not great... and a remake meant to launch a franchise should be great. This misses the mark, and I think that's why it gets so many harsh reviews.",The Mummy

But what it is is just a pretty good monster movie. Up their own backside film snobs complain there isn't enough depth, feeling or directorial panache in this film. Why? Because it's 'The Mummy' what I found was likable characters good effects and yes a bit of a disappointing ending but all in all taken as a stand alone monster movie entertaining fun.

It wasn't terrible. It was more than good. Frontlined by the awsome tom cruise who still can do action scenes as nick. A character that makes you think. No don't touch that. Then he goes and does it anyway.The films structure and action sequences are played out well in three main acts. Discovering the tomb. Villian is awoken and brings threat and finnaly hero has to destroy villain before stuff gets to bad. Annabelle Wallis brings our main herorin jenny who brings charm and a reason for the plot to begin in the first place.Sofia boutella we come to who plays ahmanet the ancient queen does well in the role you do get the sense of alart with her but ultimately don't want her to succeed but the way she is created gives enough interestAdding onto this Russell crowe makes a surpring appearance who's character I'm sure you'll see more. I fell he could tie in with the other planned films in the dark universe.Overall I feel this deserves an 8,definitely not the 5 average score. Good cast. Good score. Good plot. Yep if the rest of the universe will be like this then it could end up being the one thing nobody thought they needed. Also great job on Alex for directing this :)",The Mummy
441,crimson-17255,Only good for one watch,6,9 June 2017,"I've never watched any of the previous Mummy movies so I was slightly worried I wouldn't understand what was going on. Luckily for me, it turns out this isn't related to that series at all (aside from there being a mummy involved)I really liked how the movie began, seeing Ahmanet back in her past and how she was buried alive. There was just something about her portrayal that made me really like her. This actually continued throughout the movie and I have no idea why Nick picked Jenny over a powerful, pretty Egyptian princess (lol). Actually, out of all of the characters Ahmanet was the one that struck me the most. The way she'd grown up to become the greatest and was then tossed aside because of a newborn (plus having it happen again in the present). Nick didn't leave any lasting impressions, what with him being pretty clueless throughout the movie and not doing anything significant. And Jenny just was not my cup of tea. Not much character development for any of themIn terms of the story, there was just a lot going on for me to fully enjoy or understand what was going on. Nick was part of an army that disappears after they crash land in London but was also a smuggler, there was some strange organization hunting for creatures out in the world and Nick had to find a way to escape Ahmanet and break the curse he'd landed himself with. The ending did feel anticlimactic, what with him finally embracing the curse and overcoming it. Made me wonder why he tried to fight itPlus the things he did at the end made me feel like those suspenseful moments where I nearly screamed were for nothing. No real risks were involved for any of them (at the end), which is why I felt like it was good for one watch. Rewatching it and knowing how it ends makes everything less exciting for this genre/movie",The Mummy

Instead we got a bit of a mix match of a film. Was it linked to Brendan Fraser's version? Apparently not, but this was not made clear from trailers I saw.It was a mix of mild horror, comedy and action all rolled into one and didn't really bring anything new to the whole premise. Lets dig up some tombs, oh look a powerful beings laid to rest, best not disturb, oh wait, too late......Goes to show that even the best actors / actresses out there make some poor movies.",The Mummy

I'm easy, entertain me is all I ask. If it's a comedy? Make me laugh! If it's a tearjerker make me cry! You get the picture right? This is not a horror movie by any stretch of the imagination.

I don't get the hate & the critics ripping it to shreds. It was fun, funny, action packed, & had some definite freaky, scary moments. No bad acting or storyline in my opinion, & Russell Crowe would have made it worth seeing just for his part alone!

I hope we do get to see more from the planned ""Dark Universe"" series from Universal.",The Mummy
446,timothyalanwilliams,"""The Mummy"" Is Not ""Monster Mission Impossible""",8,7 June 2017,"Reboots are all the rage in Hollywood. Some work and some don't. So when I heard that Universal Studios had cast Tom Cruise to breathe life into ""The Mummy"" franchise (pun intended) I wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out. I loved Brandon Fraser's ""Mummy"" reboot back in 1999 (and even it's sequel ""The Mummy Returns"") with its Indiana Jones adventure type of style. With Tom Cruise (who is in his 50's by the way) making a string of ageless action-packed hits of late (""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, ""Jack Reacher"" franchise, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" to name a few), I thought this would be in that same type of vein. But this remake went for the spooky-thriller route instead. And it worked! There is a lot of story (backstory mainly), but the action is there too. Then you add the suspense and creepy characters (dare I say ""monsters"") to that and you find this film is much more like the classic Boris Karloff Mummy movies from the 1930's than just ""Mission: Impossible"" with monsters. Tom Cruise pretty much plays himself (or at least the same character he's played the last ten years or so). His supporting cast (Russell Crowe, Sofia Boutella, Annabelle Wallis, and Jake Johnson) are adequate in the parts they play, but the ultimate scene stealer was Jake Johnson who seems to be making his way from small screen fame on ""New Girl"" to more big screen roles (he had a small role in ""Jurassic World"" too). But this movie isn't about acting. It's about ""gods and monsters"". It's about Tom Cruise (looking 10 years younger than he is) running. It's about starting a new ""Dark Universe"" franchise that will eventually bring us Frankenstein's monster, the Invisible Man, and Dracula to name a few. The biggest surprise was how funny the movie was. There was lots of well-placed humor amongst the thrills and chills. I will admit, I am not a frequent horror/suspense movie watcher, so you may think the thrills and chills were milder than I did. So if you like action-adventure, ""The Walking Dead"" (you may see some zombie-like creatures chasing our lead characters) and some good old-fashioned laughs, then ""The Mummy"" could be your kind of early Summer popcorn flick.",The Mummy
447,zensurfer-31578,Glad I got discounted ticket prices,4,16 June 2017,"I was so relieved when the credits started rolling, that I thanked the gods this movie was over. What could/should have been at least a good movie turned out to be a disappointment. Most of the action scenes were not exciting, especially the Jekyll/Hyde fight, the humour was forced and not funny, there was no romantic chemistry between characters Nick and Jenny and it seems there were scenes from at least half a dozen movies thrown in there willy-nilly. It's like they got some ideas and just pasted them into the movie cluelessly. The first thing I thought as this movie began is 'this guy is an idiot' and his sidekick is even stupider, apparently this was meant to be humorous banter and turned out to be idiotic nonsense. This inane banter continues throughout the movie especially in regard to the sidekick. They keep trying to inject humour into the movie(too much for me) and keep failing. This is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy, I understand that there might be a need for some comic relief, but you haven't begun to scare me. The best scenes except one involve the mummy herself. Sucking the life out of people while crawling around in a misshapen form was great. But the best scene was when she had Nick on the altar and was licking him while straddling him that was both funny and creepy at the same time. The only other scene that was good was the airplane crash even though it went on for too long. The flashbacks were great, I honestly thought 'at last a real villain', but again I was disappointed as the villain really did nothing, except put a sandstorm down a London street. Man, there were so many possibilities and we were given only a tiny sample of what could/should have been. Why is Tom Cruise in this movie again? Why does his head look disproportionate to his body in this film? Is it an artifact of the IMAX/3D format or did they deliberately make his head look bigger? Where is all this liquid mercury coming from? Why is it in liquid form? How did it get there? Is there that much mercury on the entire planet? What is the sidekick doing in the mirror? Isn't that from 'An American Werewolf in London'? These and many other questions went through my head as I was watching the movie, showing that it was not keeping my attention. And really a terrible ending, you should have left Jenny dead and had Nick taken over by the demon, that way at the very least you had the makings of a possible sequel. Just watch one of the older Mummy films from the 40s-60s you will probably enjoy one of those movies more.",The Mummy
448,jasonsharden,Wasted on Worldbuilding,4,30 June 2017,"Despite the title, ""The Mummy"" spends too much time preparing us for the upcoming ""Dark Universe"" instead of focusing on the main plot. When the film starts, it serves us the entirety of Ahmanet's past, which ruined the mystery of her character, and ends up making the adventure feel pointless. Once she's been established, the rest of the film is either ""Mission Impossible"" (and I'll admit those scenes helped keep the film at least entertaining), or just prolonged exposition about ""Dark Universe"" stuff. As for the main plot, it tries to capture the intrigue of the original 1932 story, and the excitement of the 1999 film, but it only ends up a contrived mess. This is why I have an issue with the cinematic universe. Good stories get sacrificed for this bigger picture, and they never go anywhere. Here's to hoping they give the other classic monsters the screen time and storytelling they deserve. All this film needed was a little thing called patience. It's a shame they decided to rush it.",The Mummy

Being able to spend just 2 bucks, to watch at home, pause and rewind when you need a break, was worth it. ;)Tom Cruise played his usual character(s), but with a somewhat comic twist. That was not a good fit. The movie should have instead gone with a ""darker"" tone. What is it with these comedic movie monsters? Sure, add a witty line or comical double entendre', but this was too bland.Sofia Boutella was gorgeous and striking, and her Mummy portrayal was great. The CGI was done well, especially the ""life-sucking"" scenes that were used to regenerate her body. Interestingly, I had not seen her before this movie, and we rented ""Atomic Blonde"" along with this dvd, not knowing she was in both. The two rolls couldn't have been more opposing; she was great in both. She is definitely one to watch for in new releases. Again, worth the rental of a DVD. Enjoy!",The Mummy

454,thefirmdrummer,"Don't understand the hate, The Mummy was really cool!",8,12 June 2017,"I have read countless negative reviews for this film and too be honest, I just don't understand where everyone is coming from. I thought this movie was great, and pretty much exactly what I was expecting when I walked into the theater. I personally think people are just generally hating on the film because they dislike Tom Cruise, which I also don't understand. I think he is a fun actor and I try to see most of his movies because there are usually awesome. The Dark Universe is very exciting to me and I think they did a pretty good job setting things up for the future through this film. Obviously the Dark Universe will not be directly comparable to Marvel and DC, the complexity isn't the same and it will not be as easy to combine the characters into the same movies. In this film the blend of The Mummy and Dr. Jekyll was pretty good, Russell Crowe was fantastic in my option. Granted this isn't a masterpiece by any means but as far as action/horror goes, this was pretty good. The villain was scary, the lead role was interesting, the comic relief of Jake Johnson was pretty funny and very welcome since I am a fan of ""New Girl"". I wasn't expecting any Oscar quality from this film and I'm reviewing it from an entertainment standpoint to which I think it exceeds most movies in theaters right now. I saw Wonder Women just days before I saw this and personally I enjoyed The Mummy significantly more than Wonder Woman because it is very fast-paced, exciting, has an interesting ending, and Zack Snyder is not involved in any way.

This movie is not as bad as the really negative reviews say it is. It's certainly watchable... the real problem in my humble opinion is the casting of Tom Cruise in the lead role. He doesn't have the silly charisma that Brendan Fraser had in the 1999 film, which I thought was a real key ingredient. Also, I didn't see the chemistry between Cruise and co-star Jenny Halsey that was very evident between Fraser and Rachel Weisz.The plot was not very fulfilling either.

I've seen a lot of movies and reviewed a few of them. But my parameters of a good movie include an emotional connect with the characters, a good story and likable actors. The Mummy (2017) ensure it ticks all those boxes. The CGI is good and action sequences, some of them are breathtaking. This is in contradiction to some of the reviews. CGI is not bad at all. Tom cruise has this ability to make the characters he plays, likable. He's also got a good comic timing and those delivers some of the punch lines really well. Never during the movie would you feel bored. It keeps you at the edge of your seat with all the action unfolding scene by scene. Only felt that face in the sand animation was already done in the Brendan Fraser - Mummy movie so didn't come across as novelty. Loved the sound effects and some of the scenes appear with a bang and do manage to scare you. Having said all that, finding comedy, horror, thriller, action all in one movie, I just cannot complaint.",The Mummy

Tom Cruise is our new rogue who unleashes an ancient evil mummy onto London and running in sues, and there's a giant sand face. That's all that's worth noting really.Honestly, just go watch the 1999 Brendan Fraser The Mummy it's a much better film, an enjoyable adventure movie with better action, comedy, characters and even better gore oddly enough. This 2017 Mummy is everything the 1999 one wasn't, except maybe in terms of female characters who are equally useless in both versions. To this movies credit there's nothing bad persay it's just kinda dull and unremarkable which isn't really the greatest of things to kick of an entire movie universe, I give The Mummy 2017 a C- (even the poster is boring, just look at it!).

462,stop_thebeat,Dark Universe indeed,3,9 June 2017,"I feel so sorry for Sofia Boutella, she was the best part of this train wreck of a movie. She was dark, seductive and sexy as the psychopathic Egyptian Princes Ahmanet. Considering the film was about her she got very little screen time, instead we were forced to follow the absolutely horrific and awkward exchanges between Tom Cruise & Annabelle Wallis characters. Honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between them at all, it was like watching your mate failing at pulling for what seemed like an eternity. Jake Johnson would've made great comic relief had his character been built up instead to passed over. Basically Tom & Jake's characters are 'soldiers' tomb raiders who find a tomb of the Mummy & enter the worlds worst archaeologist Annabelle Wallis's character whining screaming (seriously she does nothing for women's rights) & getting her history wrong throughout the whole film. Tom's character in true American style shoots first then regrets his actions after unwittingly raising Ahmanet & thus begins the pain. The old movie formula of killing the black guy first is back (thank you progress). Annabelle Wallis's 'archaeologist' claims that Ahmanet is from the New Kingdom, but saws she's 5,000 years old instead of 3,000 years old. Also The only female Pharaohs were from the Middle Kingdom then the Ptolomeic period for ruling Queens. Also Set is not the Egyptian God of Death, that would be Anubis but they must've thought he would be a good bad guy after he was the main antagonist in Gods of Ancient Egypt. (basically Ancient Egypt does Power Rangers) Tom's character is resurrected inexplicably then started seeing his dead mate (American Werewolf in London style) Just when you think it's finally going somewhere we get to meet Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) & see a plethora of Universal monsters in jars, & a nod to Stephen Sommers 1999 reboot with Arnold Vosloo & Brendan Fraser. Sorry the film continues, more action sequences, running, lots of running, oh Ahmanet is back, here comes the sand & then it all goes quiet again for a bit. After a thrill-less finale we see Tom Cruise's character somehow outwit Set the so-called Egyptian God of Death who's now possessed him. He resurrects archaeologist whinge bag & vanishes probably to be brought back for more running & godawful acting in a sequel/sequels!******See the original, see the 1999 reboot, maybe even watch the bad sequel Mummy Returns from 2001, don't waste your money on this. *******",The Mummy

When i was hearing that he is starring in a new film,i didn't bother reading reviews or asking friends about the movie.I always thought that entertainment was guaranteed with him.Films that could easily have flopped like Minority report,Oblivion,Edge of tomorrow(especially the last two)because of their script, he was the main reason that made them very good films,you felt the detail to attention and the respect he had for the movie goer,the fan.And i have the theory that if Tom Cruise is playing, the film is good, no matter what genre it is, no matter who's directing it etc. So last night out of respect for the actor i paid an extra fee to my cable company and sit to watch the Mummy, without any doubt that it would continue the trend(Tom Cruise stars=good film).IT DIDN'T.First of all the Mummy falls to the category of films that you feel sorry for,not because they were that bad,no,but because without some silly stuff they could have been excellent films.The story is not bad at all,somewhere in Mesopotamia(Middle east)they find the tomb of a buried (and cursed) Egyptian princess, who thousands years ago murdered her father and her little brother to be the queen of Egypt.But they caught her and buried her alive,the idea (for me not to tell you more) was that if she was found, evil would be unleashed.And the script is not bad, but there are some major mistakes which had been made, that destroy all the film.First of all the identity of the film.It could have been a fantastic action thriller movie(even horror)but there are moments in it,they are trying to make it look like a comedy.What on earth kind of role is Jake Johnson playing and what it serves to the movie?Upsolutely nothing.Don't want to spoil it,but you will understand when you watch it.Secondly you have Russell Crowe in the cast and his character is very weak in the film and don't let me tell you about some ridiculous stuff which happens to him during the movie.There are moments that you get the feeling that the film is making fun of itself,can't put it more correctly.Sofia Boutella is captivating as the princess and it's one of the few good things about the movie.Don't want to make you tired,overall it could have been an excellent film,but unfortunately it is just mediocre and maybe below.As for me ,no i didn' t regret paying for it.Cruise has made me happy and has entertained me all these years,so one ""missed shot"" he can take.And when his new film opens, believe me, i will go to watch it,i still trust him.",The Mummy

My biggest question is why would they make this movie? The plot was unbelievably bad and so was the acting. Tom Cruise really damaged his career with this Performance.

474,bratxja,"Another ""nothing special"" and divinity of Tom Cruise",5,9 July 2017,"Few weeks ago I had such period, when you want to watch a movie, but don't know what exactly. How old is your friend? Because it's scary movie - warned me at the box office. I was intrigued. There are two chances - good marketing or really scary movie (and some parents complain about the film). Unfortunately, none. One week after... And I can't remember anything about movie. After mental efforts I remembered overall script and some details. But, this is a bad sign, isn't it?Remake of popular trash Old Mummy is one of my favorite movies in the genres of adventures / comedies / trashes. Yes, I think Mummy is a kind of trash. But creators of the new Mummy have very straight association: ancient Egypt - mummy - dark - serious - secret organization - dark - dark - serious - serious - very dark and serious! Guys, guys, this isn't remake of Underworld. There is something more troublesome - movie departs from trash and comedic roots, but instead didn't become really creepy and serious. Oops!Scary movie on the horizon! I didn't see anything that can startle you (if you have seen several movies at least). A dark atmosphere, some screamers... Script is very poor for logic and interesting scenes, but rich for action. This isn't a best strategy for movies at our time. Also, the weaving of elements from other books into the story... Can't say that the best choice. When I first heard about Dr. Jekyll, I thought ""Cool, allusion"". But there is really doctor Jekyll! Jekyll and Hyde! Writers, what are you doing with me! BTW, I had some hope for the ending. There is one plot twist, that could save the movie. I am talking about the death of Tom Cruise and dramatic ending. But at the last moment creators thought ""Stop! Sequel!"". And we lost that moment. Everyone happy, evil is defeated, dead are resurrected, Tom Cruise is god. Praise him. And I'm not kidding. This is really the ending of the movie. Medium. Very medium. Sorry, Tom Cruise, but your divinity can't help.5/10",The Mummy
475,ailishcrombie,It just didn't do it for me,4,31 January 2018,"I love the idea of the mummy and the original movies, but I have to say this one just wasn't as good as the first. 4/10 is the lowest rating I have given a movie on IMDB to date and so here is why.Before I get all doom and gloom, I have to say the visual effects, stunts, costume and whoever played the mummy were amazing! Tom cruise never disappoints in stunts and as always his acting was great. If you like stunts and effects, this is the movie for you. But if you like story and character development, this is not the movie for you.Most of the time I was waiting for twists or turns or something to happen. The story didn't really make much sense to me and I couldn't keep up with some of the character plots. The movie seemed to be made really to show off CGI and modern film making (probably a bit harsh but my opinion).I will never not go and see a movie because Tom Cruise in it, because he is the best at what he does and is so committed to his acting so I will not judge him for one movie that didn't hit the spot. I encourage others to do the same, maybe just don't watch the mummy if you are a movie fan though.Wouldn't watch it again.",The Mummy

This movie has the makings of great action movie. It never takes itself too seriously, leaves time for jokes, action heavy and a surprisingly great story.. that could've left itself open for a sequal.. but from the beginning the ""Dark Universe"" is being shoved down your throat with Dr. Jekyll front and center. It doesn't even try to sneak him in.. and even if he was just an accent it may hf ave worked, but a major scene in the movie requires a direct confrontation with his alter ego.
All that aside, it sours a really great adventure movie.. almost like Indiana Jones Lite. A great cast, a few jokes, and some pretty impressive effects, even a nod or two to the 90s remake.
It was such an enjoyable movie soured by blatant crises promotion and greed.",The Mummy
480,gwyckoff,Much better than the reviews. Not your usual stale monster film,7,29 June 2017,"This movie is quite enjoyable. I'm not sure why it's getting so many bad reviews. The action is fast paced and the acting pretty good, plus it avoids most of the major structural pitfalls that plague the monster movie genre. There were some flaws, which I will mention later, but first the strong points: ""The Monster Always Dies"". One big structural problem with monster movies is the lack of suspense. In the end, the monster is always vanquished. Any suspense revolves around the hero discovering the monster's 'fatal weakness' just in time to save the heroine. In some cases, as with the 1999 Mummy remake, the resolution is telegraphed so early and so strongly that you grow board waiting for Brendon Frasier to wade through all the special-effect laden cliff hangers to finally win the day.This remake handles the problem in a very creative and unexpected way by first making the monster venerable almost from the start and then secondly by introducing another antagonist who turns out to be equally threatening to the hero. This builds suspense as the protagonist is threatened from multiple sides.Ultimately all this climaxes in a completely unexpected ending that I honestly did not see coming; something really unique for a monster film. It may, in fact, be this ending that contributes to the negative reviews since strictly speaking it violates the hallowed monster flick formula most people have come to expect.""Damsel in Distress"". Another tiring issue with monster films is the obligation to service the inevitable damsel-in-distress theme. Again, Mummy 2017 takes a unique approach by making Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis effectively co-equals protagonists. Sometimes she saves him, sometimes he saves her, often with a good deal of humor in the role reversal.All-in-all a movie worth seeing, but of course there were some flaws. Character development is kept to a minimum; only enough to service the plot line. This contrasts with the 1999 Mummy which excelled in wonderfully interesting characters who, unfortunately, were deployed in the service of a mundane and predictable plot. Other flaws include under use of Jake Johnston as the comic relief and a serviceable but uninspiring performance by the heroine Wallis. Had she matched the charisma brought by Cruise's performance it would have added a whole new dimension to the movie. In general, though, I liked it and am interested to see more of the 'Dark Universe'.",The Mummy

No character development just a couple of loud mouthed military wannabes who are clueless in the profession of arms.

487,forchennfederation,A Flawed Yet Fun Monster Mash,6,25 April 2018,"I'm not gonna lie: I didn't see this movie in theaters and for a few reasons. First, the trailers did not sway me much. Second, this was intended to start the Dark Universe, a cinematic universe, in a similar fashion as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, intended to revive/reboot the Universal Monsters franchise; this disappointed me because Dracula Untold, which I did see in theaters and liked, was going to be the film to start this series, but when it didn't do as well as hoped Universal canned it in favor of having The Mummy be the launching pad. Third, the negative reviews certainly didn't help much, as I heard things from reviewers that really made me doubt that the movie would be any good. So, I waited until it was released for home media and rented it from Family Video not too long before the month of October, and the most shocking thing, while taking all those previous points into consideration, was that I actually liked it, and after watching it a 2nd time during the holiday season I still do. Now, it's not to say that this is a great movie, 'cuz it certainly isn't, but it's a fun action-adventure film that was just in an unfortunate position which I'll get into shortly. With all that said, let's talk about The Mummy, shall we?First of all, the cast is actually good. Tom Cruise is a lot of fun as Nick Morton: I like how he's not the most noble guy, or even that courageous, who let something loose that was never meant to be let loose by his own actions. The film tries to give him an arc where he goes from basically Nathan Drake from Uncharted if he was a straight-up dick to more of a hero; I feel like the arc could've been done a little better or at least had a little more time to develop, but it was a neat idea for a hero's journey that was executed just fine. Since Tom Cruise is his own stuntman, he brings a lot to the action scenes and it's really fun to watch, whether it's seeing him tumbling and floating in a plane that's going all mayday or seeing him get into physical combat with scary monsters. Annabelle Wallis does okay as Jenny; nothing great 'cuz the character doesn't have much depth, but she does fine. Jake Johnson as Vail, Nick's sidekick, has some funny lines and banter with Cruise that works; they take a turn with this character that's certainly taken wholesale from another (better) movie, but it was a turn that I didn't mind that much. Russell Crowe, a great actor, is a lot of fun to watch as Dr. Henry Jekyll, who runs the organization called Prodigium which tracks down, researches, and/or destroys anything supernatural or considered outlandish in the real world (sorta like S.H.I.E.L.D. from the MCU except they deal with monsters); Jekyll also has a monster of his own inside him: Mr. Hyde, who does show up at some point in the film and that leads into a fun sequence between him and Nick Morton (Cruise). But, the standout in the film has to be Sofia Boutella as the Mummy herself, Ahmanet, who seeks to use Nick as a means to put Set, an evil Egyptian god, into a vessel to basically rule the world after making a deal with the god due to being denied her place as the next-in-line to be the pharaoh of Egypt; Boutella is great in this: While Ahmanet can be seen as merely an ancient evil who seeks revenge, the actress brings a lot of emotion to the role, the makeup on her is amazing, her performance emulates a hypnotizing and seductive feeling that has you drawn in by her to where there's even a slight nuance to the character herself. I even own a Funko Pop! figure of Ahmanet, that's how much I liked Sofia Boutella and her character in this movie.The story, while nothing special, isn't badly done at all. People say that it was convoluted and hard to follow. Convoluted? A bit, yeah, but not that much more than what we see in most blockbusters, I guess. Hard to follow? No. The plot is pretty much a variant of the Brendan Fraser Mummy from 1999, with certain plot points changed and the setting being updated to present day, so not that hard to follow, honestly.The action scenes, directed by Alex Kurtzman, are actually pretty well-done. The plane sequence is great, the sequence where Nick and Jenny are being attacked by Ahmanet's zombie followers while driving in an ambulance is well done. The last 3rd of the movie is basically a series of action scenes/set pieces back-to-back, where there's no time to breathe really, going from Prodigium where Nick fights Mr. Hyde to a good chunk of London where Nick and Jenny try to evade Ahmanet, all of which was entertaining.Now, the flaws with this film, aside from the plot and execution of such being just decent, lie in the movie's approach in tone and its attempts at world-building. While it is fun to see some Easter eggs to other Universal Monsters, all those Easter eggs, as well as a big dump of exposition on what Prodigium is, come up at a certain point where the movie really does slow down, even to where it takes quite a bit of focus away from the Mummy who is supposed to be the title character. But, the movie's biggest issue is its tone: It's all over the place. Now, a movie juggling multiple different tones isn't a bad thing as long as it's executed well enough, but this movie's execution in juggling the different tones that it has is not very good; the movie would go from being serious and scary to funny, even within the same scene, and in such an abrupt transition, thus making it a bit of a jarring experience despite how fun the movie is.Now, with all that said and done, is The Mummy 2017 a bad movie? No, at least I don't think so. It's a fun flick that just seems to have been the victim of a studio's misguided attempts at pushing a franchise down people's throats and trying to copy the success of Marvel without really understanding why so many like and/or admire the MCU, thus resulting in things looking pretty grim for the Dark Universe before it even got off the ground. It's such a shame, too, because I didn't want this to fail, but it is what it is and all I can do is say that I still like The Mummy despite the happenstance. If you haven't seen The Mummy 2017, it's worth checking out; just don't expect it to be mind-blowing.",The Mummy
488,SciFighter,Great Fun,10,25 June 2017,"I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, I don't care what people say of him it is very rare for him to make a film that is not entertaining.I enjoyed this for what it was for, I kind of liked the way they turned it into an action/horror type of film rather then just more of a dark horror movie. In the same lines as the Brendan Fraser trilogy was. Though this is not a remake of that trilogy and rather a reboot of the original Mummy movie from the 30's I think a lot of people don't realize that.This was fun and entertaining, I though Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella were great in the film. Annabelle Wallis I don't think was right for her part in the movie but that was a small issue I had with it. The rest of the cast was great.It's a good flick to sit back and enjoy for a summer film with friends. Tom Cruise always puts out a quality product and did so again here.

490,rafaelsimer,Should've stick with Brendan Fraser,4,21 September 2017,"Well, I guess Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe were low on cash and needed a job that payed. I mean, why else would they be on this movie?So, Universal is trying to bring the ""dark cinema"" back, trying to bring the classic monsters to the world of today. Fine, I think it's a great idea! Monsters, vampires, werewolves, all that cool stuff could see a new light.But Godzilla (2014) was horrible enough. Kong: Skull Island (2017) was...well...average. And I'm saying that just because I'm a fan of Samuel L. Jackson.So this Mummy thing, the whole ""being mummified alive"", been a prisoner of hate for centuries, waking-up to destroy the world. Yeah, we don't buy that anymore.Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo already did that. And they did it well, very well. Then, they closed the door and left. Nothing else to do.The plot here is the same as always, nothing new. Ah, except that now Russell is Dr. Jekyll, who leads a secret society that wants to protect the world from evil and monsters of old. How they came to know about the horrors that lurk the night I don't know; maybe they read the script (or The Book of the Dead from The Mummy 1999 what was on the shelf).Now, I like Tom Cruise and I almost like Russell Crowe. I know they are good actors. But here, they weren't convincing at all. Tom Cruise is not the kind of guy you can put in that role. He should be a special agent or monster hunter...a serious and dangerous guy! Not a sergeant (or whatever) who sleeps with strangers and sells ancient relics on the black market alongside his dumb friend. I mean, it's Tom Cruise! Look at his hair, look at his teeth! Those teeth cost more than my apartment!As I said, the story is the same as always. For some reason, the mummy-girl comes back to (un)life in order to destroy or rule the world, can't remember which. So, Tom Cruise, even while been haunted by the mummy-girl after she brought him back from the dead (returning the favor, I guess), travels (part of) the world alongside a pretty girl (yeah, he already slept with her), meet Russell Jekyll and fight to save the world.Seriously, that's very brave and noble. I'd just hide in my room crying in fear.It's one of those movies that didn't have to be made. Having two big stars and showing the visual effects must have cost a lot of money. As far as I know, they didn't get it back. The plot is old and weak, the characters and the acting are bellow average and the ending has the taste of ""ok, let's forget about this, it doesn't matter"".Knowing Universal's goal of creating a dark universe, we can say they're not doing a very good job. Seems everything is done in a rush, racing against the clock. It's a pity. There was potential. The idea is very interesting. But they should have developed it better.I believe Universal will aim for vampires and werewolves next. Or maybe a swamp monster. Or the boogie man. Or a megalomaniac businessman who takes control of a powerful nation and...oops!",The Mummy

493,enterzec,The Hated Movie That Wasn't That Bad,6,31 July 2017,"Tom Cruise is a great action star and some people might not have wanted an action movie out of this. There's some horror or thriller moments to it but in the end The Mummy is an action movie and with Tom Cruise as the lead we shouldn't have expected anything else really. Tom Cruise does what he is good at and that's shooting action flicks.The reviews had been bad for the movie and didn't therefore expect much of the movie and perhaps that was part of the enjoyment that i found in the movie. The cast of Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella and Jake Johnson were good and Annabelle Wallis was solid at least but wasn't given that much opportunity to work with in my opinion. We have both Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe in a Mummy movie, try to put that thought in your mind when you think back at Brendan Fraser's the Mummy. The acting caliber is there but did Russell Crowe really fit inside this movie, he's clearly there to set-up the Universal's Dark Universe, but this have to be one of Russell Crowe worst performance in a movie.Alex Kurtzman might not have been the best person to start of this Dark Universe but i be damned if i wasn't entertained in watching this movie. It has flaws for sure but the chemistry between Cruise and Johnson in the beginning i though was top notch. Tom Cruise always manages to work great with comedic talents, we see that in the Mission Impossible franchise with Simon Pegg. It wasn't the start that Universal wanted for the Dark Universe but we can't doom it just yet. Marvel and their MCU didn't start of with the best movies. Sure Iron Man 1 was damn good, but The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 were kind of lackluster, so there's hope yet for Universal's Dark Universe.Score: 2.9/5 (Solid)www.filmtvnow.wordpress.com",The Mummy

Why's Russell Crowe doing this kind of garbage is beyond me. Tom Cruise doing this I can understand since Mission Impossible is on it's sixth or seventh cliche movie...",The Mummy
498,ceejay-cj,Critics be damned!,7,10 June 2017,"This is a good start for the rebooting of the Universal Dark Universe, if you're expecting a remake of the 1990's Mummy films then you've got the wrong idea. The first thing you should know is that this has NOTHING to do with those movies and are completely unrelated. This is a re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of movies but with a whole new agenda. This time Universal are making these films to link in with all their other monster movies, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman etc so comparing it with any other Mummy film before it like the critics keep doing is utterly pointless. The movie is a high entertaining fantasy horror film, its not the glossy action comedy level of the Brendan Fraser films, its darker and a lot more violent but still full of spectacle and a decent amount of humour that doesn't completely dominate the dramatic content as many film allow these days. Only Disney's Goofy or Loony Toon's Wild E Coyote can take the level of battering Tom Cruise gets in this movie and still stay standing. The Mummy is an exotic beauty who can hit like a Mack Truck. There are elements reminiscent of An American Werewolf in London (1981) and Lifeforce (1985) that forge this version of the Mummy and Russell Crowe's Dr Jekyll makes his glorified entrance half way through to remind you this is a shared monster universe so expect more of the same.Quite simply you either like this sort of stuff or you don't, if you listen to critics they'll convince you this is the worst movie ever made, it's not. It's actually really good fun and nothing more, it won't suddenly change your life and have you buying movie merchandise like a Star Wars film or Marvel franchise flick but it will entertain you if you're not already going into the cinema armed with a critical gun ready to shoot it down for daring to star Tom Cruise like the average Hollywood critic and their anti-Tom Cruise agenda.",The Mummy

500,rjwilton,"What's wrong with The Mummy, actually?",2,23 June 2019,"1. It's a mess.
2. Tom Cruise seems to have stolen a script written for someone entirely different.
3. The only possible explanation for the staggeringly dumb Russell Crowe voiceover that suddenly cuts in early on is bad reaction from an early test screening among particularly stupid people. It's beyond clumsy, and reveals stuff that would have been much more interesting had Cruise discovered it bit by bit.
4. It's not entirely clear what whatsername is trying to do.
5. The whole second half apparently happens in a cellar.
6. It doesn't get its theology straight before the final confrontation, so it's not clear who's trying to do what and what it means when they do. So the confrontation and its aftermath lose most of their interest and weight.
7. See 1.
8. Otherwise it might have been as enjoyable as the Brendan Fraser version, which had characters who were generally engaging, a mostly consistent and entertaining tone, and a clearer sense of narrative.",The Mummy
501,mindyfrostbite,I loved what they were AIMING for...,6,1 June 2019,"This movie was frustrating, because it was SO CLOSE to being great...and yet it fell SO SHORT.I don't know if it was the screenplay itself, the directing, or the final editing, but somewhere along the way, there was a failing or failings. Very simple elements make some of the scenes almost ridiculous (call in an airstrike and its arrival can be counted in seconds; an insane amount of mercury exposure leaves everyone utterly unaffected, etc.); it's as though they needed to get from point A to point B and decided that it didn't really matter how the journey was achieved. When telling a story, HOW you get from point A to point B is EVERYTHING! There is a significant difference between suspension of disbelief and unbelievably to the point of distraction; the elements of the story need to actually make sense.Again, it was SO CLOSE to being excellent; if there had been care for so many relatively simple details, this movie could have been something amazing.Excellent cast, great performances, but so disappointing.",The Mummy

I've seen all his movies (even Vanilla Sky). He was just the wrong person to play that roll. His presence made this ""Mission Impossible with Zombies"".I loved the Mummy.

504,SickBoyGoreHound,"If you like to be treated like an idiot, this sorry excuse for a ""movie"" might be just right for you",2,12 June 2017,"So, it's common knowledge that action movies are, for the most part (like in ""99%"") lowest common denominator products - and while this fact isn't exactly great, it's not inherently bad either: there IS such a thing as a well written, all around 'good', action movie. This new iteration of ""The Mummy"" simply isn't one. What it actually IS, instead, is a good summary of everything wrong with (a certain kind of) modern filmmaking and a GLARING example of just how much offensive a (bad) movie can be with its audience.There are, mainly, a couple of reasons why this movie is insulting, the first one being that it assumes that you - the viewer - are an imbecile, completely devoid of any ability to understand even the simplest of things or, really, to actually think for yourself. The whole (almost) two hours of run-time are SO imbued in exposition - both through visuals and dialogue, often times together - that it feels like the movie is hammering every single concept into your brain and then banging your head against a brick wall, just to make sure you understand. Every single thing is said, shown, explained, discussed and then repeated and explained again.This leads us to the second aspect in which this movie assume you are completely brain-dead: as soon as you start watching, it's almost like you can hear the producers laughing their butts off - they got your money upfront, now they are perfectly free to serve you a lazy, mediocre product that only exists as advertisement for Universal's ""Dark Universe"".There's nothing even remotely memorable, here: not even the action or the special effects are worth mentioning and, in fact, are both a bit underwhelming, for this day and age. It's not that they're bad or terrible - they're just unimpressive and not at all inventive. Once again, the thought process here seems to be ""we have your money, we are now free to sell you this crap without even trying to make it good"". Writing, acting performances, editing, score - there isn't the slightest bit of effort in sight in any aspect. The best that can be said about any of these things is calling them ""bland"". Now, I don't mean to say that everything must be as good, original, thought-provoking and innovative as the new ""Twin Peaks"" show or that every movie must be an art-house film - as I said, there are 'good' action movies that DON'T treat their audience like a bunch of intellectually impaired sheep, but this isn't the case.What is even worse is that, sometimes, this mindless (other than rather pointless) pop-corn flick tries to address serious, very delicate issues of our time (like ISIS) and it does so in the less respectfully, most heavy-handed, clueless (and mildly racist) way possible. So, all things considered: do yourself (and the world) a solid and have enough respect of your own intelligence NOT to go give any money to this insult.",The Mummy

512,schitlipz,I Needed Subtitles,3,25 May 2021,"It's not bad for a mummy movie. But it's more of a violent action flick than any kind of genuine horror. They seemed to have had a great budget for special effects, but that too doesn't negate the fact that there wasn't anything frightening here. Perhaps some children might become a little frightened at the makeup. I don't know what the key ingredient for a movie to be scary is, perhaps green pea soup -- I dunno, but this didn't have it.And the efforts of fusing technology with the spirit world, which has been tried ad nauseum in movies and TV, doesn't work, in my humble opinion. Perhaps there are a few exceptions, like Demon Seed... but if that particular example had a spiritual component, it was lost by this viewer.There was something about the movie, with regards to scenes and sets, their composition or whatever, where it all seems a little familiar. In one scene you might think, ""I saw that in The Last Crusade"", in another, ""That was in the other Mummy movie!"" or in another, ""That's the Batman scene!"" or, ""Am I watching the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?""One point bothered me most: I'm not hard of hearing, but I couldn't make out what they were talking about much of the time. From the whispering Cruise to the slurred mumblings of Crowe. It can be frustrating. I absolutely needed the subtitles.

517,LiteKoi,The Mummy - Spoilers Galore,3,18 June 2017,"The acting is one of the few things that I was okay with. I feel that Sofia Boutella has grown as an actress. Tom Cruise is good as usual, so is Russel Crowe but nothing outstanding from them either. My favourite performance comes from Anabelle Wallis whom I think is very good at displaying the range of emotions needed for her role.'Tis not enough though. There's a limit to what I can swallow, even for this kind of films. The introduction sequence where Nick and Vail are shown going after treasures/spoils of war to sell on the black market while still on duty as military officers felt ludicrously incoherent. Worst part is probably when Vail calls in an airstrike.Nick breaks the mechanism that was keeping the tomb engulfed in mercury. Feat that he accomplishes disturbingly easily, even considering the fact that firearms weren't really a thing in ancient Egypt. He then somehow becomes the chosen one, interacts with Ahmanet, getting access to flashes of her memory and she gains some control over him, but WHY ? So now he's cursed and it means that experiencing a brutal plane crash on solid land will leave him absolutely unharmed (never explained). He wakes up in a morgue so I'm guessing he had no pulse when they found him (never explained and no follow up on that whatsoever). Oh and there's the part when Vail gets bit by a venom-free spider. The venom starts taking effect during the flight (yeah yeah I know it's not venom it's MAGIC), his health rapidly but gradually degrades to a point where it's alarming and obvious, yet no one notices and he himself never asks for assistance or at least tells someone he is not feeling well. He just lays down, decays and dies without once making any kind of connection between the bite he received earlier and the dreadful evolution of his condition. But wait, now that Nick has survived the crash, he has visions of Vail who starts blaming him for shooting him even after being reminded that his reanimated brain dead corpse just killed their superior and tried to kill Nick and Jenny...REALLY ?Nick can't escape the curse, so the plan is to do the ritual to kill Seth, but wait, he can actually break the malediction if he destroys the stone, because no stone no ritual, no ritual no curse... But isn't he cursed already even before the ritual ? Did he not just survived a plane crash because of said curse ? So, apart from preventing the ritual, what does destroying the gem actually do ? ? I honestly don't understand the mechanic of that curse and since I couldn't care less, I haven't tried to make sense of it. I also didn't care about characters in the story and what could happen to them. Oh Jenny died ? OK... She's alive again ? Great... Vail is also resurrected and they go on an adventure... SURE.So let me get this straight, the hero completed a ritual to: gain immortality, revive the dead, suck out people's life force and give birth to evil incarnate by receiving Seth who is described as pure evil, God of Darkness, Satan etc. As heroes do right ? So where is Seth ? Isn't he supposed to posses him or something ? Did the hero managed to keep the darkness at bay because through a short and shallow relationship with a girl, he realized that deep down, he might be a decent human being ? Didn't he perform a supposedly unbreakable ancient ritual with legendary artefacts ? Does the writer give a damn about the coherence of his plot ? Is it just normal now for the hero of such a story to make such a terrible decision over something so trivial ? I get it, death is sad, but guess what, everyone dies, it's the circle of life, and it's not like he just lost his wife or his kid right ? Not only did he accept to receive evil incarnate to revive a single a girl he barely knew, but he also revives Vail who casually comes back like nothing ever happened and more importantly, not a hint from the movie that reviving people should at least have some grave consequences. Jenny and Vail seem perfectly okay, whole and just as they were before. So it's just your typical resurrection from pure evil forces with no side effects then, classic. I didn't see any point in Jekyll/Hide except setting up the ""Dark Universe"" franchise. Funny how Hide wanted to make a pact with the hero to work for him after he'd perform the ritual. Riiiight, and what exactly do you bring to the table ? You can what, punch slightly harder that a regular human being and have superior yet inconsistent strength ? Cool, cool cool cool... Even Ser Meryn fricking Trant would beat that guy in single combat !The only time I laughed was when Jenny tells Nick that he's a good human being because he didn't hesitate to give her the only parachute. He silently looks at her with a conflicted expression and tells her he thought there was another one. Ironically enough, I don't think that the scene was meant to be funny, oh well. I got the feeling that the movie is bad, knows it, but still tries to go for it hoping it will work somehow.There a few bits I enjoyed here and there, the plane crashing was one of them. Obviously, and as I was reminded reading other reviews, the film will appeal to some folks out there, which is perfectly fine with me. I can't think of any reason why I would recommend that movie though, or what kind of public it would suit. Give it a go AT YOUR OWN RISKS (theatre is very costly nowadays).",The Mummy

It's a OK enough summer popcorn flick with plenty of explosions, actions, and Tom Cruise running. It might come as cheesy at some points, and the plot's somewhat messy, but this is what I was expecting, a dumb, fun, loud, cheesy movie. If you walk in to the cinema expecting more than that, you'll walk out being furious to the makers of this movie. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. On the other hand, the advertising clearly took a wrong direction by selling it as a franchise-starter. Studios need realize and wake up that you can't just make a movie to start a Marvel-ish dynasty. If they want to start a universe, just let it flow, don't rush it! DCEU fell to that pit with its earlier movies (Thanks to Wonder- Woman, people might actually start to get interested in that universe).

It is a film where you just sit back, eat popcorn, watch the endless action, laugh and enjoy.

523,bentheredfan,Clearly... Universal wasn't prepared for the darkness.,3,25 June 2017,"Score: 3/10, 1.5/5, 30%, F (Disclaimer: I will be reviewing this title on its own merit. That means it will NOT be dependent upon the original or the 2000s remake for its negative and positive aspects). Positive Aspects: Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde (portrayed by Russell Crow) was a decent enough character in his own right. His Perigium/Perdigium secret society formed upon the basis of combating the evil that does indeed try to penetrate our world is a nice touch as well and adds for a level of connection to the spiritual warfare that takes place in society today and the general battle of good and evil we must all face in our daily lives. I especially enjoyed the ""recognize, examine, contain, and destroy"" quote when pertaining to the absolute evil that is a real threat and danger. Negative Aspects: There's a difference between a flawed main character that I can still relate to and root for and a hapless idiot that I am all too thrilled to see die. Chris Vail (portrayed by Jake Johnson) is undeniably annoying and unnecessary, delivering stupid one-liners and acting like an animal driven by dumb, illogical actions. The guy is brave enough (or maybe stupid enough) to call in an air-strike on his own location, yet when his partner wisely tries to run and leave him behind, he panics like a child? I guess he was supposed to be comic relief, but again, I was almost leaping out of the theater seat watching him die. Nick Mortan (portrayed by Tom Cruise) is annoying as well, but for different reasons. You can tell they tried to go for the Indiana Jones/Nathan Drake vibe, but ends up just being an ignorant, flat character that wanders through the world around him simply because he can. I'm not sure if this is Cruise's fault, however, because some of the dialogue that was written for him (by David Koepp and Dylan Krussman), is nonsensical and would require the viewer to totally numb themselves in deeper ignorance than Nick himself to let slide. He's predictable and tough to root for. Jenny Halsey (portrayed by Annabelle Harris) is just your archetypal damsel-in- distress that has sexual connection with the rogue(ish) main character and the secret society that the main character haplessly stumbles upon and ends up working for. Harris doesn't do well in the role, but more than that, we are supposed to believe that through one sexual interaction and bits and pieces of conversations without any REAL dialogue going on, they form a loving relationship significant enough for Nick to sacrifice himself and his freedom in order to bring Jenny back to life?! No. I don't buy it. I'd like to preface this next part by saying this: I found Sofia Boutella, who portrayed the main villain and ""mummy"" character Ahmanet, absolutely gorgeous, almost unnaturally so. However, too much of the movie tried to sell itself on her sex appeal, without actually advancing the plot or enhancing the character. Add to that some pretty awful dialogue and NUMEROUS plot holes, and you have a movie that has a little potential, but largely squanders it. I'm not entirely sure why Universal chose to set up the Dark Universe when they clearly were not prepared, but perhaps later movies such as Frankenstein will truly capitalize on the potential here. The Final Verdict: If you feel you need to watch this to be prepared for movies to come, find the Russel Crowe scenes on Youtube, and find the ending. You can seek out a picture of Boutella on IMDb or Google should you wish.",The Mummy

If the majority thinks it's fantastic, i usually dislike it in some form and now with this one again, but the other way round. Shocking : The mummy is actually pretty entertaining in a the ""switch the brain off"" way. Just sit down bring a beer some snack and enjoy the antics of Tom Cruise and his girlfriend to be in this really well made action flick. Of course at the end there is a setup for a new movie and a possible new Marvel type superhero, but this time the new superhero might actually be worth a new movie. The mummy itself played by Sofia Boutella is well made and well played, evil but not over the top evil. The eye candy is supplied by Annabelle Wallis who is a pleasure to watch even if she doesn't say anything.

At no point in the movie was I even taken aback. When it comes to the plot holes (and there are many), the major one is this: Why Nick in particular? She could've used absolutely any man's body, so why him? There was no reason whatsoever for him to be the chosen one, his body is merely a vessel. The second plot hole: This mummy with apparently infinite powers can't even subdue a man who isn't even big in proportions? How? One of the things that bothered me above all things was Vail's character. Not only was he in no way relevant to the story and its progression, but he's supposed to be the ""comic relief"" and he's one of the least hilarious characters I've ever seen in movies. His on-screen time embodies the worst parts of the movie. When he was killed, he should've stayed dead for all eternity. Speaking of characters' deaths, I doubt any sympathy would've been inspired from the audience at any of the main characters' deaths, except maybe Ahmanet (The Mummy herself). You know a movie is bad when you're rooting for what's supposed to be evil incarnated. Nick has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and not only does he NOT care for Jenny, but on more than one occasion he shows no interest concerning her fate, leaving her to fend for herself against the mummy at one point and hopping off in a van. So when he sacrifices himself for her at the end, it makes absolutely no sense that he would do that, given that he hasn't cared about her the entire movie. We're not talking about the typical asshole-but-deep-down-he- cares main character, we're talking about a plain asshole, period. Oh and as for Jenny, this is the second movie I've seen with Annabelle Wallis and in both movies she doesn't have the least bit of charisma, so needless to say I'm not thrilled to watch a project she's involved in.My 3 stars are for the following: The visuals, they were good. Princess Ahmanet, beautifully played by Sofia Boutella who would've easily stolen the show had she been given more insight, which she should have. Last but not least, Russel Crowe's Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, which in my opinion was really good but unfortunately didn't have enough screen time or insight, just like Ahmanet. The movie centered too much about Tom Cruise when in my humble opinion his character didn't even need to exist. It could've just been the discovery of this mummy, led by Dr. Jekyll's team, and kick off the rest of the Dark Universe films with this. The stereotypical ""hero"" doesn't need to win in every movie, especially not in one that is intended to set off Dark movies to come. It would've been interesting to have Ahmanet succeed in this movie and go off to clash with the upcoming Dark Universe monsters. Now that would've been a great DU start.",The Mummy

528,RecordScratchReview,"Nick, go back to New Girl",5,13 September 2018,"Worth watching once, sure, why not? 
Good movie for years to come, absolutely not.The movie is filled to the brim with missed opportunities. Action scenes were good, but were killed by awkwardly timed or poorly written jokes. Comic relief wasn't good and made everything else feel cheap and low budget. Jake Johnson (Nick from New Girl) played the same exact character as the show he is known for... a lazy, inept and awkward sidekick. This doesn't meld well with Tom Cruise; it feels forced. If you do see the movie... think about the fact that Jake Johnson's character could have pretty much been erased from this movie and it wouldn't have done anything to the storyline. Russel Crowe is in this movie too! That should be a good sign... nope. You are left confused about his character and role in the movie. I gave it a 5/10 because it still has a few good moments within a subpar movie. Plot was slightly intriguing. Actors overall were decent. I personally think that a completely different list of actors would have made the movie better. It didn't feel right. Give it a try though.",The Mummy

533,AaronDSimpson,Just Give us Brendan Fraser Back,4,16 July 2017,"There is nothing in the discography of the fifty-five year-old actor that could convince the viewer that he is the young, cocksure ex-military intelligence officer that he claims to be. The only thing that the portrayal of looter Nick Morton accurately represents is the psyche of the modern American; cracking jokes about translations of the word 'Haram' – a word important in Islam – claiming that he is not a looter but a 'liberator of precious antiquities', stating that the destruction of historical artefacts in war is tragic whilst taking orders from the Colonel (Vance) that protects them, and suggesting that he and Vail (Johnson) can 'slip in and out' of an Iraqi village before decimating it in gunfire and hell-fire missiles.It is even more complicated that the hell-fire missile that Morton brings down on the town unveils a cavern and, therein, the treasure that he and Vail were in Iraq appropriating the dress of Bedouin tribesmen to find, because it begins an overwhelming sensation of gratitude for the missile and the sense that the deaths of the militants were worth it because of the priceless antiquity it enabled them to find – so much so that Halsey (Wallis), the woman whom Morton stole a map from, forgives the theft and enters the cavern with them.It seems that these moments of awkward self-reflection comes as part of setting the film in Iraq; attempting to access the ancient history of Mesopotamia but knowing that the present cannot be rewritten or excluded from the cinematic gaze. It makes sense that a reboot should distance itself from its predecessors, but producing a film about mummies and Egyptian treasure but not filming or even setting the narrative in Egypt even once could be seen as a step too far from the core idea of the franchise behind The Mummy (2017).From here, the gasps and moments of awe by Jenny Halsey are in all the places that you might expect them to be, and all of the screams of horror at camel spiders by Vail are at the pitches that you anticipated. The team uncover a sarcophagus weighed down in a vat of mercury to prevent evil spirits from taking root. When they airlift the artefacts from the tomb, whilst being chased by an eerily large sandstorm, Morton catches a glimpse of Halsey's stomach and instead of joining her conversation about the significance of the find or develops a curiosity for the supernatural events that are beginning to unfurl, asks only why she didn't tell everyone that they had sex for longer than fifteen seconds.From the introduction to the film it is established that, during the crusades,English knights stole a gem from the dagger Ahmanet was given by Set and took it back to London where it was buried with them beneath the Thames. Even though this is an aspect of the film that makes little sense, the viewer understands the ride that they're being taken on and decides to take the entire film with a gigantic pinch of salt and collectively bet on how many countries the film will visit before Egypt.Ahmanet's revival is a curious one; choosing mainly male victims and kissing them, sucking the life out of their bodies is a statement of female power and sexuality that clashes violently with the sexist character of Nick Morton and the degrading of Halsey's character throughout the film. Perhaps choosing Morton as the 'chosen one' is the jewel in her revival. She requires a sacrifice of a lover, a chosen one, using the ceremonial dagger in order to complete her pact with Seth. It might seem to the viewer that Morton was chosen because he happens to be the most 'beautiful' person around, but it could be that his behaviour contributes towards the feminine victory that Ahmanet seeks by sacrificing him. However, this isn't something that comes across on screen as she is never permitted to complete the ritual.Setting aside the confusing geography, the gendered power play, and unoriginal interpretations of mythology, the real condemnation of this film lies in the decision to cast Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll. The part is one that makes even less sense than an Egyptian mummy rummaging around a crypt in Surrey and adds nothing of substance to the film. It is understood that Jekyll is a form of collector of antiquities and a purveyor of curses and ancient magic which has been inspired by his own condition. Independently, his character makes sense and his motivations are sound, but in the narrative, this is something that could only work as a film about Dr. Jekyll or some spin-off of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Included in the story of The Mummy (2017), the centrality Dr. Jekyll only reduces the film's already weak presentation into complete farce – especially when paired with the use of CGI to enhance an actor's appearance when it wasn't required.The Mummy (2017) is a costly misstep for Dark Universe, becoming increasingly worse as the minutes go by. Nick's sacrifice for Halsey, stabbing himself with Set's dagger comes out of nowhere. The time spent showing us how bad things can be when Dr. Jekyll becomes Mr. Hyde neglects an already valid villain in Ahmanet and prevents any character growth and relationship dynamism. It is hard to pinpoint the moment that Nick stops objectifying Halsey and begins to develop feelings for her, but this is something lost amongst the cheese that Kurtzman begins to throw at us thick and fast; delivering monologues about good and evil and claiming that 'sometimes it takes a monster to fight a monster' without even giving a nod to Dr. Jekyll after Crowe fought so hard to make the character work.Read more: 'www.thecineastereview.wordpress.com'",The Mummy

That being said, its very new and bold approach keeping in mind that the previous series was a hit amongst masses all over. You can expect amazing direction and screenplay.

536,Anthony89,The Mummy doesn't deserve all the hate it's been getting,7,10 September 2017,"I feel like that as a fan of this movie I needed to write this review & defend it from some of the negative reviews it has been receiving. The 2017 version of The Mummy does a good job of kicking of the Dark Universes remakes of all the old monster movies. I feel it has been getting a lot of negative reviews that are undeserved. Here are my thoughts of the good & bad of the mummy........The good:Performances - Sofia Boutella gave a great performance of the mummy, I really liked her in this role & felt she was the stand out in this movie, she was great in the first kingsman movie & continues her great work as the villain in this movie. She was very powerful & scary throughout the movie. Russell Crowe was also good as Dr Jekyll, I feel he will play an important role & will be the essential character to link the Dark universe together. A lot of people are saying Tom Cruise wasn't right for the part, I think if you like Tom Cruise then you won't mind him in this movie, his performance wasn't Oscar worthy or anything like that, but it was good as an action based hero, but also a hero who wasn't always the good guy & making good guy decisions. I personally do like Tom Cruise so had no problem with him being the leading man in this movie.The action - no surprise here that the action was great & was a visually impressive movie to watch for a big summer blockbuster movie, the best action scene I would have to say was the plane crash scene, I am glad they made this as real as possible as it certainly paid off.The bad:Jake Johnson - I normally like Jake Johnson & think he is generally funny in most things he has been in, but in this movie his role as the comic relief didn't really work. It felt very weird when he was apparently dead but still showing up to guide Tom Cruise while still trying to crack jokes, this didn't really make sense & the jokes generally did not land. Felt rushed - At times the movie did go at a very fast pace & felt that there could have been a deeper storyline with other characters such as Tom Cruise's character Nick Morton. The only back story we got was the mummy's herself at the start of the movie. I am hoping though that's what the future Dark universe movies will do & delve further into the backgrounds of the characters.The ending also came about very abruptly between the fight between Cruise & Boutella, you just learn about Dr Jekyll's hidden lair & then shortly after the end fight scene took place.Overall I would have liked some more character depth in the movie and it did feel like it was over fairly quickly but it was still an entertaining movie & good start to the franchise that has certainly made me interested in what the Dark universe has to offer. It did not deserve all the hate it has received.",The Mummy

538,Film96,"Far from being a bad film, ""The Mummy"" provides some thrills and spectacular visuals",6,30 May 2017,"The Mummy franchise has been struggling lately. Ever since the original 1999 movie was released, the movies have gradually gotten worse. The first ""Mummy"" was slick, well made and entertaining; the second was your typical B/C movie, not the worst but far from the best, and then with the third installment it was clear that Hollywood had given up on the franchise and wanted one more pay-cheque. Skip forward to 2017 and we appear to have something just as good as the original. Sure, for some, the flashy visuals may seem like a cover-up for the (occasional) uninspired dialogue, however, there is no doubt that a lot of money was invested in making this film look good, and it sure delivers on that aspect (even with The Scorpion King setting the bar very low, ""The Mummy"" (2017) still looks pretty amazing). Tom Cruise stars, which to some may be a turn-off, but I think some credit is due here. Tom has made a name for himself in the M:I film's, and with his performance in ""The Mummy"", he shows audiences that perhaps it's not too late to make a name for yourself in a different franchise. He's not the best actor in the world by any means, but he does the job and he does it well enough for the film to be taken reasonably seriously. I think that it's important to remember that you're not seeing anything ground- breaking with this film; it's not going to have the same impact as the original Mummy title and it certainly isn't going to steal the show at the Oscars, but it has its moments of adrenaline-pumping action, well-crafted visuals and smart dialogue. Some of this 1hr 47min Egyptian-fetish flick feels a bit clunky, and the story is all too familiar sounding (disturbing an ancient evil which comes back to wreak havoc on everyone), but when you consider that there have been worse Mummy films, 2 to be exact and that Alien Covenant hasn't exactly set the bar for reboots particularly high, The Mummy has its entertainment value, it has its action and suspense, but it also has some cracks in its sarcophagi which will, hopefully, be ironed out when they inevitably make another of these in 2 or so years time. Not the worst, not the best, but definitely worth watching for a few thrills.Parental Guidance: Some scary scenes, moments of moderate fantasy horror and bloody violence, language (15+)",The Mummy

Honestly, the one thing that bugged be from the beginning was the fact that that princess whatever the f her name is (SPOILER ALERT) needed to make a pact with the god of death just to knife her dad and an infant. I mean, why bother making questionable deals with deities just to stick a dagger into somebody? Nevermind that, the movie is a drag. In my opinion this is clearly a movie made for audiences outside of the USA, especially for the Chinese audience, because apparently the name Tom Cruise and 'good movie' aren't mutually exclusive in China.

Unfortunately neither came to fruition. Having been a huge fan of the Brendan Fraser / Rachel Weisz versions and their chemistry on screen I had hoped that they would have been able to at least achieve this between the two leading characters. It felt so forced throughout the whole film that at times it was painful to watch.The special effects at times (the mummies bandages) are a bit laughable and what a waste of Russell Crowe's talents. It felt that Russell character was being restrained to not overshadow TC! Why? If you have not watched any of the previous Mummy films you may get some enjoyment out of this version though I don't hold out much hope.

I like all of the Transformer movies for example...just dumb fun can be entertaining for an afternoon.Actors, who I believe are much better than what is on display in this movie, seem to be going through the motions much of the time. This film is a complete waste of Sofia Boutella and that isn't because I think she has great range as an actress, she's okay and is great to look at, but because it appears they signed her on just to expose her most carnal attributes.Tom Cruise has reached a point where he is just retracing steps he's already taken in film. Edge of Tomorrow was typical Cruise and entertaining while The Mummy is typical Cruise that fails. It is important that his style mesh well with those around him in a film and that didn't really happen in The Mummy.I have to wonder how low the public ratings would be on sites like this if the Scientology crowd wasn't attempting to jack up the votes? Thankfully the near future has Cruise returning to his roots in Mission Impossible and another Edge of Tomorrow feature.Spend your time in the theater this summer watching anything else and save The Mummy for a rainy day on DVD if you feel you have to see it for yourself...or at least find a corner of the theater away from any other viewers.

While Sofia Boutella is lovely her Ahmanet lacks depth. Same thing happens with Russel Crowe's Dr. Jekyll. I was hoping for a standalone Dr. Jekyll/ Mr Hide movie, but with that approach there is nothing to work with. Such a shame. Tom Cruise has had some great roles in the past. That was not one of them. Nope. Annabelle Wallis performance ain't bad, but the character is simply forgettable. What good can be said about the movie? Visually it's great. Both the camera-work and the FX look good.

So yes... the whole movie is about the mummy getting stronger, awakenings a lot of zombies, hunting the main characters...Honestly... if they would have kept the seriousness and done something radical with the story - it could have been a REALLY good movie. But no, instead they did what ""Johnny English"" does with ""James Bond""... basically a satire on itself. And I mean... I laugh at Johnny English, but... this is not funny... its just bad... sorry. It had a lot of potential and it even started off quite well. But ended up in something that cannot be unseen. Damn! What a shame...",The Mummy
562,lostcultur3,Decent at best.,4,9 December 2017,"(May or may not have spoilers considering how you look at it) Now let's get this straight, this movie is NOT thaat good. It's nothing compared to the original mummy movie. It lacks the feeling of mystery and darkness. Watching the first mummy movie actually had me creeped out when I first saw it, but considering I was little kid I was creeped out by a lot of things. But I do know that the first one was mysterious and also, badass.(Brendan Fraser was the sh!t) But considering that this is not an actual reboot, we owe to the film maker to consider this as a separate movie and not compare it to the previous version.(Although I recall a little book from a certain movie in one scene *wink wink*) The jokes in the movie were actually funny so a plus point for that. The action was fine, another point (or half a point). Story? Ehhh, it was fine for what it's worth. Acting? What you'd expect from the cast. Good and professional. Overall, If you're looking for a movie for pure entertainment value this has it all. But if you're a movie fanatic like me. It's fine to watch but not that impressive.",The Mummy

Universal could afford the best screen writers in the world, and this lazy excuse for a movie is the best they could come up with?Below average is being kind, although it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. Great action sequences. Visually beautiful - every scene would make a good photograph. Tom Cruise displays very limited acting abilities and his comedic timing is way off. He's not at all convincing as a naughty-but-nice womanizer/rogue as portrayed in the beginning of the movie. Zero chemistry between the entire cast. They were mostly good in their own way but you don't care about any of them and they aren't a cohesive team so if someone dies or gets the crap beaten out of them nobody cares and that affects the movie. Some mortifyingly cheesy moments and dialog. The Mummy shrieks in supposedly ""ancient Egyptian"" ""Sha-nay-noo!"" Uh? What?!!! Boring as hell and an incredibly lame and lazy excuse for a plot that takes place mostly in London so the beauty and allure of the desert feeling is lost. The look and feel of it is more like a Jack The Ripper movie than a Mummy movie. Lame and abrupt ending that just screams ""sequel."" (Please God, no more ""Sha-nay- noooooooo!"")They tried to use elements from the more popular and well loved Brendan Fraser movies and just slapped them into this movie randomly: Pick a desperate, love struck Mummy, select a lead rogue, find a pretty woman with a British accent, add a sidekick to assist lead rogue for some attempt at added comedic relief, sprinkle in some other decaying creatures and top it all off with a few creepy crawly bugs and action-heavy sequences and hey, pesto, you have a Mummy movie!Um... no!",The Mummy
565,samanthagiavia,I thought this was supposed to be a bad movie?,9,31 March 2018,"It goes to show how easily people can be told what to think. I never got into the previous mummy movies they seemed to cartoonish. This version was a lot more enjoyable to watch. The story was good, the special effects were great and it left you wanting to see what would happen next in the story. There really isn't a reason to dislike the movie other than expecting it to be something else. It's about a Princess that uses magic to gain power for her and her lover but she is killed in the process and then her tomb is unearthed and she comes back to complete the ritual and be reunited with her lover the classic mummy story. As a fan of old and new ""monster"" movies I can say that I enjoyed the few hints this movie threw even caught notice of the ""Creature form the black lagoons"" hand. Monster movies like these are niche as it is and most people probably don't even know what the monster squad is. If you're not into these types of monster movies you probably won't enjoy it. I would say the criticism for this movie has been much undeserved.",The Mummy
566,Movie-Scene-by-Temo,Originality there isn't,4,5 April 2019,"It's the usual story: a gravesite is found of Egyptian origin, an unknown figure encased within a sarcophagus that is guarded by foreboding figures, opening the casket unleashes an evil force intent on taking over the world unless a small group of (under the radar, highly connected and financed) soldiers stop it. The only thing different this time is that the man who unleashes the evil force is Tom Cruise as character Nick Morton and this film launches the beginning of a new era in film at Universal Studios: Dark Universe.Universal Studios ('Fast and Furious' franchise their current top grosser) is unleashing its monsters and gods from its vaults, some first portrayed in the movies in the 1920s, smartening them up for 21st century audiences and creating new campaigns around them. Millions of dollars is going into this project which began with the unveiling of the new logo and music theme. We can expect to see from Universal's catalog Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Wolf Man (1941), Dracula (1931), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Phantom of the Opera (1925), Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and the Invisible Man (1933). The Mummy was first seen in 1932.Universal is not alone in doing this, we have seen Disney studios create franchises around its Marvel characters (The Avengers) and Lucasfilm (the Star Wars saga) while Warner Brothers has DC Comics (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman). With that in mind, reportedly we will have Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Edward Scissor Hands) as the Invisible Man and Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men, Skyfall) as Frankenstein.Director Alex Kurtzman (People Like Us, New Day (TV)) had at his disposal a catalog whose characters will most likely be overlapping other Universal franchise stories as decided by the studio writers. In The Mummy he cleverly mashes the ""Mummy"" story with ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" although the character ""Dr. Henry Jekyll"" is in public domain, and not owned by anyone/organization. Unfortunately, originality ended there.Russell Crowe (Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind) plays Dr. Henry Jekyll head of Prodigium, an organization with the mandate to track, study and destroy evil that cannot be controlled-he himself can barely control his own alter-ego. Imprisoned and released Egyptian Princess Ahmanet is well played by Algeria's Sofia Boutella, (Kingsman, Star Trek Beyond). Tom Cruise (Mission: Impossible, Jerry Maguire) known for bringing it 100% is underused, or the script seriously lacking. This is the case for Crowe as well. Those defining moments when one can say, ""Only Tom/Russell could have done that,"" are seriously missing. The role of Egyptologist, anti-evil secret agent Jenny (Annabelle Wallis of X-Men, the Tudors, King Arthur), could have been left out entirely if it were not to create a love triangle, which may be further developed in future movies: the Princess wants Morton and Morton wants Jane.Originality there isn't: we have seen the little scarab beetle crawl across the floor, the desert, to climb into an ear and kill, the dust storm with the face of evil, the attack by a cloud of birds, the crusader tombs, the soul and life draining kiss/mouth lock that produces ghouls. What Universal Studios promised is that the new franchises would be global-new locations, new influences. As a very casual salute to this in the movie are the opening scene ""Iraqi insurgents"" shooting the faces off ancient statues and Morton, a U.S. solder on a tour of duty, using his time to find and steal ancient artifacts much to the annoyance of his superior officer, Colonel Greenway played by Courtney B. Vance (Terminator Genisys, State of Affairs (TV)).This movie is disappointing despite its star-power. Nothing is concluded: there are scenes where both Nick Morton and Dr. Jekyll (and Hyde) battle the evil within themselves signaling further franchise creation and cross-use with the two and the Mummy herself. Two hours come to naught or little. We await the 'Bride of Frankenstein' with a projected release of February 2019-let it be current, interesting and thought provoking.",The Mummy
567,sadakobayushi,You're going to have to try harder if you want to get this Universe off the ground,7,9 June 2017,"'The Mummy' is a solid 'C' movie. It's got some fun, it's got some thrills, I'll probably get it on DVD when it comes out, but it isn't really good enough to kick start this Dark Universe that Universal wants. Part of its problem is one of tone: it will waffle back and forth from creeping dread to cracking jokes. The action is fine, there's less of it than you would have expected, but the attempts to create atmosphere are hampered by some, admittedly decent enough, attempts at humor that don't fit the flow.It's worth a watch, it's enjoyable, but it's not great. Hopefully the next one is better.",The Mummy
568,bosozoku,Routine effort with many writing flaws,4,16 June 2017,"No spoilers, just opinions on the movie's tone, character development, etc.'The Mummy' could have been so much better with just a few minor changes to the script and a few different choices by the director. It could have had that perfect balance of horror, wonder, and comedic relief that many blockbusters have achieved. Some examples - 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981), 'Jurassic Park' (1993), and yes, 'The Mummy' (1999). There is a natural transition between awe and fear and comedic relief throughout these films, and these movies pull you in so deep that you don't feel manipulated. Not so with 'The Mummy' (2017).Instead, this movie feels forced. Like a mashup of horror movie clichés plus bad comedy plus buddy movie clichés. It feels like the filmmakers ran out of story development time or script rewrite time or both, then filmed the script as it was. The result is neither original nor scary, which would have been OK if the film was at least fun in some way. It isn't.And why isn't the movie fun? Because the characters aren't well-developed. The protagonist, Nick, is supposed to be a scoundrel of sorts. But we don't believe that because we never see any of his backstory. No character development. The Jenny buddy character is at first unlikable, then snap-morphs into a sympathetic sweetheart. Poor character development. The only character with any backstory is the mummy herself.Two more obvious writing mistakes: excessive voice-over narration and TV news broadcasts. Both quick-and-easy ways of bringing the audience up to speed, but they both scream ""lazy writing"". You feel like you're being lectured. Good writing is hard, but it's worth the effort.Another filmmaking shortcut: many scenes, supposedly indoors and outdoors, are lit with the exact same diffuse overhead lighting. Obviously filmed on a sound stage. Just a few more fill lights here and there would have created different atmospheres for these scenes. But no, most of the dimly lit scenes have the same stagey look-and-feel. This is the fault of the cinematographer. The cinematographer is also the official lighting director.So, if you are a Sofia Boutella fan or a Tom Cruise fan, go see the film. Otherwise just go see some other better film for a second or third time.",The Mummy
569,blackbriar246,Don't believe the butthurt from Fraser fans - a good film and a great start to a new cinematic universe,8,9 June 2017,"First of all, I was expecting this movie to be total garbage.Second, this is definitely intended as the first of several Universal monster movie remakes, which will all take place in the same universe and have some degree of crossover. Some not too subtle nods to Jekyll and Hyde, Dracula, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Could have been more that I missed. Third, this film strays quite a bit from the original Mummy film and Fraser's Mummy movies.I was very worried about this movie. I'm a big fan of the original Universal monster films, and I was afraid that this would be another 2010 Wolfman. Thankfully, this time, the filmmakers hit the sweet spot - the movie fits well with modern audiences but pays homage to the original Universal monsters. It's not a fantastic movie, but it excels at what it is: an action monster romp and the introduction to the monster cinematic universe.The film differs quite a bit from the original: it is set in modern day, and the mummy is female. The mummy being female doesn't change things that much, although the back story is changed quite a bit. I enjoyed the new back story and found it more interesting than the one in the original film and in Fraser's. The modern day setting added something fresh: let's not forget that we have seen 3 mummy films set back several decades in Egypt. Tom Cruise plays the same sort of character that he always does, but it wasn't offensive here. Sofia is great as the mummy. Jake Johnson is enjoyable and funny, but thankfully doesn't overshadow the darker tones of the film. Russell Crowe is a treat. The other characters are serviceable. Without getting too into spoilers, this new cinematic universe seems off to a great start. The concept of monsters in the modern age is handled mostly seriously, but with the occasional humor - this topic can't be taken completely seriously after all. It isn't as dim and grim and depressing as the DC universe seems to be headed, but it is more serious and gritty than the Marvel films. A pleasant surprise. Don't expect it to hold to the original film or the Fraser movies and you'll enjoy it. And with any amount of success, there will be more monster movies to follow.",The Mummy

The plane scene alone had me turning around in my seat. Whenever the film slows down it gets into action swiftly- I loved it.""Tom Cruise is awful"" - serious? Yeah he is his age doing what he does. But he brings stardom to this feature. A younger unknown dude could have worked but it would be a tad bit thin. Tom is what, 54+, and he still brings stunts and glow. ""The previous reboots were better and way more believable"" etc. - ?? Pretty much the same story but with a few tweaks. So she wants her chosen one instead of Imothep longing for his old fling etc.I think that people thought they were going to see a straight reboot of the 1999 version with an older Fraser in it. The movie delivers what it needs and has Crowe supporting the leads. I was very happy with some simple, popcorn blockbusting for an evening.

They were especially weak in dark scenes.The film was highly edited and there was lots of CGI acting really never entered the equation. It was fine in the sense that criticism would be strictly based on whether you like these stars or not. I would agree Cruise had no special chemistry with his leading lady but that was the fault of the story and script.The script and story were the worst I have seen in my memory, I contemplated leaving several times but I was too lazy. truly egregious. And I don't mean ""a story abut a reincarnated mummy is so silly"". I mean ""the story about a reincarnated mummy was the best story line and they should have stuck to that"".You have been warned. A shame. Because if it had been no better or worse than ""average mummy shocker"" I would have been more than satisfied.Advice to Universal: your Dark Universe idea needs CPR, get better writers and story lines or you are headed for failure.How anyone could have seen the last five minutes of the film and not realized this movie needed to be re-worked, I don't understand.Wow.

My only expectation was to be entertained and the movie delivered. The effects were alright, the acting OK, the story kind of thrown together, but it worked for what I wanted. I liked that Tom Cruise varied from his only character and played a hero who... lets just say his elevator seemed to stop one or two floors shy of the penthouse suite. I loved Jake Johnson, but I love him pretty much all the time, the mummy wasn't scary or creepy, but her zombie mummies made up for that and the ""heroine"" was a loss, the story was more than a little silly (come on, Jekyll and Hyde?) but I finished it, so I was entertained.I didn't go into this expecting it to be as awesome as the Brendan Frazier films from the 90's, I was younger and had lower expectations in a lot more than just movies, so maybe that's why my panties aren't in a twist about a remake. Also, let's be honest, the story line for the third installment wasn't exactly art either. Hopefully we've all learned from this and realize that a man who only has enough depth to play one character the last 20 or so years is not the best person to give carte blanche.",The Mummy

It didn't really stand a chance when competing against Wonder Woman in terms of box office.It is a Tom Cruise movie, he's shown the most out of anyone.I thought he was good at acting in this and it showed. It has a great supporting cast and Sofia Boutella as The Mummy was amazing, glad she was cast as it. Jake Johnson's character in it was funny which added to the enjoyment. You could've taken Russel Crowe's character straight outta there and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. What he was saying just confused me, didn't serve anything to the plot and he was barely shown. It had awesome visuals and was really well made. That scene in the plane was really something to look at,epic. They really shouldn't have shown as much of the fight and action scenes beforehand in the trailers etc. as it gave too much away and had viewers knowing what to expect.

The premise of the film could have been really interesting but the screen writing was that of a 12 year old. Cruise and his stupid partner (the guy not the girl) have just fallen into (literally) the most important archaeological find in the history of the world and they are acting like pre-pubescents trying to steal some of the loot and arguing back and forth.

There was way too much going on to enjoy the mummy storyline, which was the most interesting part. Sofia and Jake Johnson get the least screen time and are the only ones that shine. The two main actors I found to be cheesy and their lines weren't good. I didn't buy their relationship one bit bc there was no chemistry and no build up. I wanted Jenny to be killed pretty early on in the film, then figured out the boring pedestrian ending. Tom Cruise's character falls apart at the end with his ""inner good man"" and his struggle to beat the God of Death - when his body is just supposed to be a vessel, implying he's not home, not himself anymore after the stabbing ritual.
Inserting Dr. Jekyll really threw the movie off and I lost interest very quickly. ***Maybe the dark universe storyline gets hinted at after credits role and leave viewers intrigued and liking where it's going,instead of what we saw.***

Annabel Wallis was very mediocre to say the least, Russel Crowe was like Tom Cruise Russel Crowe but not bad. Fun that Hyde is already in there.
Sofia Boutella was not bad, but not great but the only ray of light.This was not a movie about a mummy, but a movie about a Egyptian princess, who showed up out of nowhere in the mist with no idea how. They gave her a sexy look because it sells, she creates her followers by kissing/sucking the life out of them...""how convenient to have a princess.""The story starts in with Templars burying one of their own with the dagger, then in the UK with a weak SHIELD creation led by Crowe. Then a flashback to Egypt about the princess and the Cruise and his buddy in the former Mesopothemia finding the tomb then back to England it shoots by you in a flash.Did not like the ghost buddy of Cruise, why and how...
The special effects had some decent moments but also a lot of bad ones, while Nick and Jenny run from the museum, you see Cruise looking at his side while one would look at the exit and nowhere else, while exiting there are a lot of people while the only two running were NIck and Jenny.
The mummies were more like zombies, which basicly they are but at least with rags now everyone ""kissed"" is a zommummy thing.

I have never seen Tom Cruise this bad since the infamous sofa incident, I can't decide if hes playing for laughs or if someone has slipped him a Mickey Finn.

A total insult to science, reality and basic human intelligence. Some science-fiction might be far-out, but it usually has some basis within the realm of scientific possibility. This movie was just a total insult to science and the happenings within it could never be rationalized with any type of scientific theory. The writer is just making up total nonsense garbage and the viewer is just stuck along for the ride through nonsense & stupidity. Besides the total absurdity of the happenings within the film, even the acting, the wardrobe and the scenery feels like a production.In a good movie one remains engaged and ""forgets"" that they are even watching a production of actors wearing costumes on fake sets.This just feels like an all around B-grade film, which should have had Brandon Frasier return to the film series as the lead. Actually, no. The script should have been burned.I found myself continuing to watch this film simply because it was so terrible and absurd that I couldn't help but further study and highlight the awfulness of it.I can't believe Tom Cruise would take on such a ridiculously stupid script. From now on, Tom Cruise being the lead role in a movie means absolutely nothing and should lead no one to assume that the movie has any worth. 0 stars.",The Mummy

It's basically almost the same as the original movie. With the addition of the Dark Universe plot. And I liked it. Imagine all our childhood monsters in one franchise! All that said, the movie wasn't THAT bad. There were some lame lines but who do we blame, the script writers? Or the actor who delivered it? Truthfully, I blame the actor. Initially, I blame Tom Cruise. Would have been better if it was Bradley Cooper, John Krasinski, James Marsden or even Brendan Fraser. Seriously, those comedic lines weren't made for Cruise. And whenever he's doing his action scenes, all I keep thinking about is Mission Impossible: Supernatural Edition.On another note, the interjection of Jekyll/Hyde in the story is a nice introduction. Because of this, makes me wonder, is the Dark Universe movie going to be like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Should we expect Captain Nemo and Tom Sawyer? Will Huck Finn be involved?

I thought the first half was well-done but the second half went off the tracks. Lately, I've been using what I call the RESURGENCE scale to evaluate films since INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE is the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years (and we see a lot of movies). THE MUMMY is nowhere near as bad as ID:R. It's too long, has a number of disjointed scenes, and steals liberally from a number of other films; however, that being said, the origin of this movie is an interesting variation on all the mummies that have come before (my favorite remains Hammer's 1959 version). The screenwriter introduces some clever new mythology that I found intriguing. If you are worrying about spending money on it,see it during a bargain matinée if your theater has one.",The Mummy
604,bspektral,Dissapointing,5,4 November 2020,"Heading out of the theater I was dissapointed to say the least....Of course Tom Cruise killed it as an actor in this film.
But the story is Boring, it doesn't have the same feel as the 1999 and 2001 one and it has a pretty dull ending.
Alot of people may enjoy it and I get that but for me it was just a ""Whatever"" movie.
If you want a good movie which entertains you I recommend staying away from this and choosing another Movie.

606,hm8619,Awful!!,1,14 July 2020,How anyone can rate this film over a 5 I don't know. It is not entertaining. The dialogue is awful. The 'jokes' are totally inane and don't work. Tom cruise as the lead is terrible. The mummy is portrayed well but is not featured enough! They randomly waste a whole segment introducing Dr jekyll/ Mr Hyde- but that really doesn't work.

607,Duckmaster,So bad it's offensive,1,26 October 2017,"Oh dear. I so wanted to like this movie - a big budget remake of The Mummy starring Tom Cruise? What could go wrong? Well, as it turns out, everything. Of all the classic Universal monsters, the Mummy was always my favourite. The 1999 version was enjoyable, here I was expecting a much darker, dare I say scary update. Nope. They've taken the best elements of the 1999 film (sandstorm with the giant face of the Mummy, Zombies/Mummies used as slaves/henchmen, the backstory of the Mummy) and inserted them into this mess. Couldn't they come up with something original? Cruise is miscast, it turns into Mission impossible - The Mummy protocol. The Mummy herself doesn't do much, far more screen time is given to Cruise in order to justify his salary, no doubt. Bottom line, The Mummy is a confused mess, playing more like 28 Days Later or the Walking Dead, and I was bored to tears throughout, other than the plane crash - the only excitement in the film. And the ending? So Cruise is now the Mummy, but a good, friendly Mummy? Please. Avoid at all costs!",The Mummy
608,muaddib-23,Legit competition for other universes. Unfortunately critics will write what the highest bidder ask them to,8,3 March 2018,"This movie falls into action entertaining category and as such is far better than some critics and reviewers are trying to tell you.The story is plain simple and predictable. An ancient evil have been awoken and.. you probably have already guessed the rest at this point. No surprise really, but that is just fine.This movie is far better than any other Marvel or Disney movie in the sense that characters have consistent set of skills/powers which are not being bend on constant basis at the will of the director to fit his current storytelling.The humor is well balanced. It is light and fitting the action. You won't get that tasteless impression found in Indiana Jones or Pirates of Caribbean where the viewer is literally fed with not so funny jokes at regular intervals. Animations are nice and well polished. Also well balanced and won't hurt your eyes. Rooms and corridors are dark as they should be. Magic doesn't necessarily produce explosive effects which is a good thing in my book.Sofia Boutella makes a great ancient beauty and fits the role perfectly.I personally don't really enjoy Tom Cruise all that much, but in this movie he is far more authentic than let say Harrison Ford in the last installment of Indiana Jones.Taking all of above into the account and comparing it to similar movies of the genre I think the movie is above average and it is a very good start for the fresh franchise which could disrupt the monopoly of Marvel's bonanza.
Such competition is probably deemed unnecessary by the leaders in the industry therefore I have the suspicion that low ratings are of their doing.
The competition in Hollywood can be far more evil and foul than any ancient being portrayed in these movies.Overall it is an average entertainment movie, but properly executed and far more consistent than what limitless and incoherent imagination of Marvel Studio can muster.",The Mummy

Has Tom just gotten desperate for money to give to the Scientology freaks. Then we have the mix of Russell Crowe in this a Dr. Jekyll. Were they trying to do two movies in one. The movie ending leaves room for a sequel. I hope that doesn't happen.Stick to your Mission Impossible movies Tom.,The Mummy
610,halaszgabor1990,"A little rough around the edges, but...",7,8 June 2017,"I can't hate this film, even if it seems like that's what's going to be trending. As a Dark Universe movie, it obviously follows the footprints of the comic book movie universes, while utilizing old Universal/Hammer horror movie elements.I believe most of the naysayers expected a new horror movie anthology, one that brings the same fright that the old ones did we used to watch as kids. Honestly, Universal horror movies can't be that sort of frightening anymore,since we are not the same people anymore either. Universal was never about jumpscares or deep psychological horror like the current trending ""horror"" themes. It was about slowly creeping fear caused by fictional monsters.In my opinion, Dark Universe films are and will be meant to be watched as action films infused with classic horror elements and characters instead of the other way around. And to me, those few elements did hit the spot.My favorite bits horror-wise are the mummy herself immediately after resurrection: that shambling, crawling undead figure with dislocated joints and broken bones was exactly like something you wouldn't want to see heading your way in a dark London alley.I also liked Cruise being chased by the undead Crusaders under water. The relatively slow movement all while being underwater, half-drowning, really is a nightmarish situation even if it is not meant to make you jump out of your seat (which I still find to be the cheapest sort of thrill, therefore a bad idea).The makers deciding not to use CGI in an exhibitionist way was another one of these good bits: in many scenes, the overall darkness leaves just enough for our imagination to fill in with scary ideas instead of showing off so much, we start noticing how sterile and unfrightening CGI looks in general (I'm looking at you, Alien: Covenant).As for being an action flick, yes, it definitely wasn't a John Wick or a Rogue One. Not terrible, not great either, and had a little problem with unnecessary action sequences. The fight between the characters of Cruise and Crowe was lacking any motivation other than showing off. Improve it in the following movies, please (which I do hope to come).How could it be better? More detailed characters: okay, we know, the girl is cute, Tom Cruise is bringing the Tom Cruise we know from most of his movies since the 80s and Crowe is Jekyll/Hyde, but who are they as characters in this very universe? If you're building a universe, you need strong, memorable characters to build it upon, glory of the past and eye candy is simply not enough.More inventive action scenes. Watching Dracula and the Ottoman army duke it out from the reflection of a wobbling sword in Dracula Untold was a good one. More like that, less ""Tom Cruise gets the umpteenth pimp smack the very same way from an obviously stronger enemy"".Giving some power to the Good, if Evil has so much would spice things up. Jekyll's self-sustained evil is nice, but why stop there? Let's make it really interesting. What if the reanimation of the dead Crusaders backfired and they tried to fight Ahmanet due to their once holy life? They were trying to guard that gem after all, keeping their oath in their death would have been a nice addition. I understand that the franchise is more about monsters than heroes, but reducing the possibilities of what *could* happen in a still forming universe is unnecessary and even harmful.These three points are the three missing stars from my rating (based on the axiom of this movie is meant to be an action movie). The Mummy is by no means a bad film, but whatever you may expect it to be, you will find it at least a little disappointing for one reason or the other.",The Mummy
611,ValcaVII,Egyptian Myth with less Magic,7,10 June 2017,"I'm hoping there would be a lot of Egyptian stuff in this movie like its predecessor.Yet, I found lack of Magic, lack of ancient Egyptian language, and most of the scenes are in England.....I need more of God summoning rituals I need more of protection charms I need more of spells I need more of Egyptian mythEntertaining yet unsatisfied ending",The Mummy
612,trulyjewelly,Just don't bother,2,3 November 2019,"I doubt whether I can say anything new about how bad this film is, but there's no harm in trying! The effect of double pupils in all the evil ones eyes was unsightly and immediately made it impossible to look at them, when their double pupils came on. Why did Dr Jekyll act as if he was possessed by evil without it tying in to the main evil at work, like he was independently evil, and then the inconsistency was made worse as the lead character flashes back to him saying kindly, inspirational things at the end even though he's already experienced him trying to kill him?It was offensive as it didn't mind promoting the idea that a current triviality could be enough to counter the force of Ancient Egypt. It abuses Ancient Egypt to the extent that it's probably brought about a unique curse on itself. How can anyone take Ancient Egyptian religion in vain? I didn't feel so shocked at this abusiveness in the earlier Mummy films. I think they've lost respect for the subject and gone ever more along the commercial vein, to mine it like dead mummies from tombs. They're plundering a highly advanced, potent religion in the same way as the 19th Century explorers did. What I saw when the lead character was making himself into an immortal god of death with a dagger in order to have the power of Life and Death was seriously cheap. Ancient Egyptian religion isn't anything according to these film makers - you could dance with a mummy in a disco - you could do anything you like with that stuff because it's not real. Whoever thinks that is unfathomably and ridiculously ignorant, making money out of people's positive and genuine curiosity. It closes down their understanding and curiosity though, and just adds to the fog and malaise of our times. It's a film that shouldn't be allowed to be made and but I've still given it 2 stars as I like Tom Cruise and some of the witty banter like when he tells the princess person that they're never going to be together, and it's her not him! There's some entertainment to be had !",The Mummy

Although by now it has become quite difficult to come up with something altogether new with mummy flicks, I think they did a very good job. The plot was interesting and the choice of a female character as the mummy was certainly right. The acting and dialogues were good; the special effects were great. We loved the sets and locations. And of course, the plot reminded us about the very real existence of evil. We didn't really find a lot of humor (except at the beginning) but the movie is anything but boring.

The makers of this movie don't seem to have decided whether they wanted it to be Indiana Jones or to be Ghostbusters or to be World War Z. So we get a bunch of jokes that don't really work, a bunch of zombies that never pose a credible threat to the good guys, an adventurer who seems to be a bit of a wimp, and a romance between 2 characters portrayed by actors who didn't appear to have much interest in portraying a romance.

617,ivan-samuelson,So glad I didn't pay to watch this in the theaters,1,30 October 2017,"Awful, awful, awful. That's all I can say. I grew up watching the old Universal monster movies (Frankenstein, The Wolfman, The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dracula). Those were all my favorites.When The Mummy came out back in the late 90's, I was a bit perplexed. Didn't watch it until I rented it and I loved it. It was funny, it was cheesy at times, and the CGI were not bad back then (although they haven't aged well at all). But it was a VERY enjoyable movie. I have to say, I liked the 2nd one not as much as the first, but the 3rd one was bad.Now we have Tom Cruise jumping into the foray. O'Connell he is not. Even the gratuitous scene with Cruise obviously naked just shows the aging he is going through. And the chemistry between his character and Annabelle's character is so off, it just defies all imagination. And come on. A special forces man also doing ""grave robbing""? He'd have been court martialed in a second.The CGI was even WORSE than in the second Brendan Frazier Mummy. And the action scenes were hard to watch. And reading how after being on a late-night TV show Cruise invited the entire audience to see the movie and he bused them to it just shows how hard they were trying to push this movie. I think they already knew it was bad.The story-line is cheap, not hard to follow and yet they feel like the audience is stupid and they have to explain it all. I had to stop watching it mid-way through because I was falling asleep. I finished it the next day, only to discover there was only about 15 minutes left. Clocking under two hours, it felt like 4. It was that bad.What I really felt like they were trying to do is push this almost like a superhero movie. Are we really going to push the monsters into that direction? As super heroes? So glad I got this from our library. I feel for those that spent money for this obvious mess of a movie. And yet, it apparently is not the end. There are more coming. Ugh.",The Mummy
618,Purdinator,Surprising Signs of Life,6,4 November 2017,"As the opening salvo for Universal's Dark Universe, ""The Mummy"" is every bit a non-starter. It does nothing to generate the overarching wonder needed to propel such an effort along - no unique settings, no unique story elements, and no broad cast of characters an audience might clamor to know better. What there is, is Tom Cruise. He's a peculiar choice to lead us into this intended universe, as he's already fully associated with the M:I franchise and is much too established to ""grow into a role"". He's Tom Cruise. Full stop. Expecting ""The Mummy"" to rank near the top of a filmography as extensive as his is just setting it up for failure.Yet, ""The Mummy"" somehow, someway...works. Not in the way that the Universal powers-that-be intended, but more in the mold of a cat-and-mouse psychological thriller. Cruise plays slightly against type, as a rapacious soldier/treasure hunter trekking around Iraq with good buddy Jake Johnson in search of antiquities, while contributing just enough to the war effort to stay under the radar. When the two happen across an ancient Egyptian tomb courtesy of a tip stolen from straight-laced archaeologist Annabelle Wallis, they think they've got the find of their lives.What they get is cursed, as the tomb houses power-mad princess Sofia Boutella, who swiftly settles on Cruise as the linchpin for her evil plan and transforms Johnson into a spectral ghoul meant to guide Cruise her way. Building toward the inevitable confrontation, the film eschews the outre swashbuckling of its predecessors and opts for a lower-key approach. Cruise struggles with the mental connection Boutella has initiated with him, along with his own dissolute nature, as he struggles with the very physical zombies left in the temptress's wake. And this temptress is a formidable one; Boutella is a dangerous, yet delicate, presence that's a fair change-up from your average monster.Perhaps even more curious than Cruise's presence here is that of Russell Crowe, who's aboard as the leader of an underground monster-hunting organization. It's the film's big try at world-building, and it must have sounded better in principle than it works in practice. It might go without saying, but this organization is full of people who aren't particularly good at their jobs. In the end, it's one more stumbling block for Cruise to negotiate. We do a get a rather enjoyable fight scene in the bargain, though.That and the other action sequences are handled capably. Cruise performs with his trademark breakneck energy and owns those moments above any others. Admittedly, that's not difficult to do when his character's curse has him staggered and moon-faced at pretty much all times else. Plus, there's a (well-advertised) plane crash scene that's a genuine pulse-pounder. This is all well-balanced with a bizarre strain of dark humor that runs through the proceedings, and should have been played up more. Much of this is courtesy of ghoul Johnson, who proves a curse isn't enough to shatter a man's goofball nature as he pays repeated homage to ""An American Werewolf In London"". Crowe gets rather goofy himself as he regales Cruise with grandiose exposition, delivered with highbrow matter-of-factness and tongue firmly in cheek.All in all, ""The Mummy"" is a diverting lark rather than the slam-bang blockbuster it was built up to be. It's never particularly predictable or lacking for pace, and Cruise remains as watchable as ever. In fact, the film could have benefited from more time to further develop his character, along with Wallis - who's unfortunately relegated to playing a rather generic damsel in distress, despite her demonstration of the chops needed to share the screen with a dynamo like Cruise. Upgrading her role to co-protagonist would have been a smart move. Given the tepid reception, it's hard to imagine this proposed Dark Universe gaining any steam. But, if this pair returns, anything to follow might just be worth a look.",The Mummy

But if you walked in looking at it as it's own entity, it still probably disappointed you. But truth be told I'm one who likes to give movies a fair chance and even though it had potential to be better than it was, it still was an average film of fun and adventure. Some of the scenes I really enjoyed. Others, left something to be desired. Overall though I feel most movies that have Tom Cruise, I don't walk away hating because I genuinely think he's a fantastic actor. Not to mistake it with me thinking he's a fantastic human in real life because...eh. But genuinely, I do enjoy 95% of his movies. This one was good if you give it a chance.

It's a completely new story line with some aspects thrown in to reference the previous versions. It has been extremely well written in terms of it's potential. You have to think about what will come next and look out for the little clues throughout. It makes you think about the future possibilities of this franchise. In regards to the film it self. Well it definitely has moments of suspense and a good degree of comical moments. The actors involved show great commitment to the franchise and I can only imagine what is to come. All in all it's a great start and with the list of monsters the film can tap into I am definitely looking forward to the next installments.

Thank You Director for  ruining this film and making us more reluctant to watch future reboots.  Dark universe is really going to have a dark future.

It's cheesy, it's got a love triangle, awkward pauses, one-liners, terrible sex references. And Tom Cruise's love interest gets younger and younger in every new movie he does, (well technically 5000 years older in this one). The plot line made me cry for Hellboy 3 and hate American Gods. Jake Johnson's role in this was so annoying I kept hoping he would die in next scene. Is he dead yet? Is he dead yet? Is he gone yet? Is it over yet? Oh curse the world! I'm going to avoid any movie that he stars in for now on. Oh wait I already do that. How is New Girl still on television? Anyway, if you liked The Mummy (1999), avoid this movie. If you liked The Mummy (1932), avoid this movie. If you liked The Mummy (1959), avoid this movie. If you really liked Hellboy, prepare to cry and bomb the revival when it lands. If you played the Uncharted video games, you can actually picture Tom Cruise as Nathan Drake and Annabelle Wallis as Elena Fisher. Maybe a movie based on the last game was possible, then they could backtrack to the first one with different actors and actresses. But alas! Hollywood decided to do this film! There is no way you could even like this film for the visuals, it is completely CGI! It looked like a game trailer for Mountain Dew! The scene where the glass turned to sand was pretty cool though.)

Seriously, if they're all going to be like this they're not going to be worth watching....There is something about Tom Cruise that really doesn't sit right in this movie, it's like the cast looked at the script and just thought ""lets act this out as wooden as possible"". The zombie/mummy/undead foot soldiers get really boring after the first scene and the whole story line is really poorly thought out. Russel Crowe as Dr Jekyll (why is Dr Jekyll even relevant...he'll no doubt feature in the next crappy movie) is a nothing really poor casting...Mr Hyde, it turns out, is an angry cockney. Wooden, poor repetitive storyline...you really don't give two sh*ts half an hour in if everyone dies.",The Mummy
626,AlixSinnamon,Horrendous Piece of Trash,1,2 August 2017,"After hearing that this movie was supposed to usher in an entire slew of retelling of classic monsters, I knew I had to see it. The trendy thing to do in Hollywood now is to create several movies that tie loosely together, so why wouldn't Universal attempt it? Well, they shouldn't have, and making more would be a huge mistake.This movie is terrible, in literally every way. Imagine if Underworld and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had a baby, and you have this movie.The story is a mess, and the portrayal of the story is somehow even worse. It is filled with plot holes and scenes that go nowhere and defy the movie's own timeline. The characters are not believable and they have absolutely no connection on screen. It seems every actor jut wanted a paycheck. Cruise is getting lazy, for sure. Crowe's Dr. Jekyll is (to say the least) found wanting. Though some have said that the girl who played the so-called Mummy was excellent, I don't see it. She was simply being sex appeal while painted grey. The humor falls flat, as well. You can't help but compare it to Brendan Fraser's Mummy; that film was absolutely excellent despite what it lacked in convincing cgi. Speaking of which, the effects in this movie were trying too hard. Worst cg spiders ever, and that's saying something. The zombies that the Mummy uses move in ways that I know are supposed to be creepy, but they just come off like a 90's video game cut scene.Simply put, this movie isn't worth anything. It should not have been made. It would be entirely forgettable if it wasn't so freakishly awful. Pathetic.",The Mummy
627,leeledwith,Oh Tom what have you done,3,30 June 2017,Tom Cruise has never been one of my favourite actors but he found a niche with the MI franchise and has had the odd success elsewhere - e.g. Collateral had him do some grown up acting. In this however his performance is on a par with a bit player from a local theatre who has walked into a blockbuster and is hamming it up for all he is worth.The lead ladies do their best but whenever TC is on screen his gurning destroys it for me.Hopefully there will be no sequel.,The Mummy

I'm sure there are people out there who care about the preciseness of Egyptology and all that guff....but this is a fantasy film! Afterall....Egyptian Gods don't really exist (sorry was that a spoiler??) It had action, a good few jumps, bit of romance, great CGI and lots of groanworthy cheese to keep it light.....I had a similar feeling after watching Armageddon when it had finished and that's one of my top 5 of all time (so you get the drift of my taste lol) ....I flippin loved it.",The Mummy

Simply because Tom Cruise gets way too much screen time compared to the beautiful Sofia Boutella who plays the role of Ahmanet in a great way. I also missed the great sets of Egypt which made the first two Mummy movies as great as they were. So yeah, Sofia Boutella saves this movie for me a little but if they're gonna do a sequel, they should change a few thing like make the mummy the most important person in the movie and bring back Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weisz or both of them.

This was supposed to be the film that kicked off the new Universal Dark Universe... a remaking of the classic Universal monster movies. Hoo boy, what a terrible, terrible start.The film doesn't even know what it wants to be: action movie, horror thriller, not well thought-out attempt to cash in on the summer blockbuster season... ugh.I won't rehash the plot... simply because there really is none other than a mummy (well, a long- dead Egyptian queen), has arisen, and woefully miscast Tom Cruise has the thankless role to pretend to be interested in nothing that is happening in this mess. I'm not a very big Cruise fan, but even I had to sympathize with his attempt to take any of this nonsense seriously. If Universal really wanted to reboot their original monster horror franchise, they really couldn't have started out worse. Remaking the classic Karloff horror film (also brilliantly redone by Hammer Studios in 1959, and at least made entertaining in the first reboot with Brendan Fraisier) by essentially making a Transformers film with a mummy instead of a morphing truck is a death-knell.This does not bode well for future Universal remakes... especially since this film includes a ridiculous appearance by Dr. Jeckyll (Russel Crowe just looking for a paycheck).I predict, at most, one more film in this ludicrous and pathetic Dark Universe series... if that.",The Mummy

The idea behind the new Mummy (i.e., the dark universe of monster movies) is very interesting and I can't wait for the sequels but in terms of acting it did not reach my expectations. Praise to Sofia Boutella and her interpretation of the princess Ahmanet. She did excellent job and demonstrated the evil as good as Arnold Vosloo did in the Mummy from 1999. Tom Cruise plays just another action role in the same order as Mission impossible but he is far from his brilliant roles and good acting he displayed in Magnolia etc. On the other hand Annabelle Wallis is the weakest chain in this acting show and totally not up to the role. I also find the dialogs very poorly worked out. Sometimes you don't know if they are supposed to be funny for the broader audience or only of the few chosen people. I don't think that the movie is worth the cinema ticket but it could be a nice evening movie at home.",The Mummy

I was surprised by the fact that it was not totally unwatchable one can actually give it a try, the biggest problem of the movie was the TITLE itself when you have an old movie with the same title one will expect it to be along the same line or at least match it in terms of narration style etc., however, this movie is no relation to the old ones, in fact, I was surprised to the fact that this was called a remake to the old one. WATCH IT WITH NO EXPECTATIONS AND YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE IT That being said this is best watched at home as the last 20 minutes of the movie was simply draggy would have been better if it was concluded quickly The only miss with the cast seemed to Tom Cruise, it felt that he was simply not apt for this kind of role, he tried his best though Will This be good for a Universe (Dark Universe)??🤔 Why on earth the film makers have to start working on a movie with a universe build up in mind, that itself blows up things out of the box, the concentration of the movie is something which is nonexistent (so called dark universe) and not on the movie itself *********This is my personal opinion about the movie************",The Mummy

Avoid.",1,14 August 2017,"Thoroughly disappointing with no real story line, or at least the story-building is dreadfully badly done. Filled up with predictable and tired movie clichés and holes in the story you could drive a double-decked bus through. The movie jumps all over regardless of connection to any continuity or plot and the characters lack any depth at all. Tom Cruise is lazy and as flat as a plank until the very end, and the obligatory love interest/pretty lady is not much better, though at least seemed to be trying. But, especially the casting of the New Girl guy is deeply problematic. Not only is he known for nothing else, but he blatantly overacts the exact same annoying character (that mostly works) in New Girl. In a movie that struggles hard to engage you through the first 2/3 at least, his casting and/or direction is really the killing blow for this ginormous turkey of a movie. There really isn't a second that passes with him on screen where he isn't ""just that weird, babbling guy from New Girl"". Any good things? Well, Sofia Boutella is as good as she could be, considering, and I would watch her in anything. But even so, during this movie I contemplated several times to just stop watching and use my time for something better. Also, the odd inclusion of Jekyll/Hyde was fairly industrious I thought (though completely and utterly unnecessary bar sequel plans). At least it answered my big question from the very first scene: ""Why on earth London/England?"". In the poorly executed spirit of the rest of this movie, his implied immortality/longevity, the obvious existence of a huge, secret supernatural evil fighting organization founded or run by him etc. etc. doesn't even get a mention, though. Weirdly the movie also sets up for a sequel with future London based evil-fighting etc, but it is seriously hard to believe that anyone involved with this stinker really thought a sequel will ever happen. This is the worst kind of movie really: All packaging, fancy trailers, celeb interviews on all the talk-shows, - the works.

654,yoonkicoolguy,They should have left The Mummy buried...,5,2 August 2017,"The Mummy has potentials to be a better movie that never cracks it's shelling and stays for eternity to be rotten. The Mummy is the first attempt and the entry of Universal Studio's Dark Universe. We've seen countless remakes, reboots, and sequels, prevalent attempts in the general concept of the mummy. Presumably, the most memorable The Mummy (1999) movie might come into thought for some. It might affect for the false anticipation of the newest The Mummy movie which has none of its convivial nor campy fun from its recent franchise. It is safe to say, Tom Cruise is certainly talented and trustworthy at the action sequences in which he throws himself without a stunt double to seem more realistic and lets the audience to have fun. Once again, he does extraordinary and absurd stunts no actor could ever more entice. Unlike Cruise's recent action films, he portrays a firmly contrasting distinctive character who is partially a thief and a 'jerk'. Tom's recent film, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, was one of Tom Cruise's most dearly dull and lifeless performance. On the other hand, Cruise as Nick Morton was furthermore careful and gratifying. He was more captivating as a character like Nick who is the opposite of a hero. A welcome addition, Russell Crowe as Mr. Jekyll was one of the nonpareil, best aspect this film can offer. Mr. Jekyll was by far the most intriguing and enthralling character of them all. Sofia Boutella as the main antagonist, the Mummy was impactful and memorable. On the other hand, the character Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) is a damsel in distress. Her character is a weakling and irritates help from Nick unendingly. It's not the acting that bothers me, it's the result of poor writing and the amount of large screen time she deserves. In addition, some of the dialogues are horrendous and randomly odd. Conjointly, this film lacks pure originality and a clash of inconsistent tones that leads to the most substantial flaw. The most substantial flaw is this film feels as if it resembles a gigantic set- up, a gateway for more Dark Universe films (that has been a trend lately in Hollywood). And I'm not buying into it. Overall, The Mummy has some true entertainment values and sequences of amusing action. The set piece production designs are marvelous and visually stunning with ancient Egyptian monumental sets. It provides enough solid eye candy visuals but this doesn't outweigh the fact that The Mummy feels scatterbrained and resembles a gateway for more Dark Universe films. Grade: C+",The Mummy

But truly outstanding is Sofia Boutella, elegant, charming, menacing alluring, vulnerable and bad ass.

It wasn't unbearable to watch, but it will be like junk food : easy come, easy go.I always liked Tom Cruise in sci fi movies, but here he's trying too hard to be funny, and it fell flat. You can add to that a lot of unanswered questions (how the hell can someone be declared dead after a plane crash, but suddenly he can get out, free as a bird, no question asked...), some weird introduction to characters you really didn't expect, and at the end you don't really know what to do with the story.It's not bad or good, it just... exists. Something teenagers will enjoy to watch for Halloween I guess.

658,eicarbuckle,A worthy Tom Cruise action flick!,6,21 March 2018,"Let's give Tom a break, okay? He's come a long way as an actor. Was The Mummy really that bad of a movie? Have you seen the Transformer sequels? Now those are bad movies. After all 71% of Google users that voted liked The Mummy. So, it was a box office flop, for many reasons. Or was it? The film cost $125 million to make, it grossed almost $32 million opening weekend, and grossed $410 million world wide. Cruise was even awarded a Razzie for the worst actor for this film. This was supposed to be the first film in a multi-movie franchise called The Dark Universe from Universal Studios. Monster movie remakes of Dracula, The Wolfman and Frankenstein were supposed to follow. But because of its success, or lack of, the whole project may have been canceled. I thought it was a pretty cool movie! Dark magic, impressive special effects, powerful action, explosions, things getting destroyed, things that would make you jump and one seriously pissed off woman. Sure the story was a little crazy, unbelievable, full of holes, lame, and didn't make sense, but so was the story for The Last Jedi! Ouch! Tom Cruise seemed to be doing the kind of action he has always been best at, only in this movie he gets slapped around by a woman. An evil mummy woman with dark powers, sure, but still a woman. Tom was still tough! Sure, this was no Mission Impossible, but it was no Cocktail either. I felt this movie was enjoyable and worth a watch. I mean, it took 64 takes to get that impressive zero gravity scene right. Heck, I might even watch it again if it was on Netflix and it was late at night, I couldn't sleep, the wife was out of town and I couldn't find anything else to watch. SPOILER! Russell Crowe as Mr. Hyde? Who saw that coming? He's one tough dude. To think Cruise would be dukeing it out with Crowe? Interesting. I felt the movie effectively set itself up not only for a sequel but a string of following movies. We want to see what becomes of Crowe as Dr. Jeckyl right? Not to mention what becomes of Nick Morton, the character played by Cruise. Back from the dead? Super powers? Dark magic? Cursed? I'm not sure why so many critics reviews were so harsh. One of Cruise's best films? No. But he certainly didn't deserve a worst actor Razzie. Those are reserved for Adam Sandler for any one of his movies. I hope The Dark Universe isn't cancelled due to this films lack of success, or the brutal bashing from viewers. Imagine the potential of a Wolfman or Frankenstein remake?

First, remove all notion's that the film is going to resemble any previous ""incarnation"". It does not. It is an action filled, CGI dominated thrill ride of a popcorn movie. Perfect for summer and not subject to withhold intense scrutiny. I would have chosen a lead with less baggage, but Tom Cruise gives you a Tom Cruise performance. Lot's of narrow escapes, explosion's and suspension of disbelief moment's. The lead really is Sofia Boutella as a vengeful Egyptian princess who is denied what she believes is her rightful place on the throne in ancient Egypt after her father & mother finally deliver's a male heir for the throne. Enraged she kill's mother, father and child and is arrested and mummified alive and placed in a sarcophagus in an underground cavern that keep's her entombed by filling the sarcophagus with mercury. A millenia or two pass and a bomb blow's open her antechamber in present day Iraq (aka Mesopotamia). All hell ensues when she's awakened as she's brought back to London and attempt's (and succeed's) in using Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) as her human vessel to hold Set, the ancient God of Death. Many CGI moment's with a crystal found in the ancient crusader's tomb successfully reunited with the ancient dagger to allow Ahmenotep (Sofia Boutella) to turn Cruise into Set and help her rule the world.

If you like a pop-corn flick with a shallow story and lots of action in it.

I don't even have to think harder about how to do it? There's barely an effort put into coming up with an interesting monster destroying ploy, so it definitely falls short.And the J&Hyde thing is just a distraction - Yes, it's the company setting up a series of movies in this universe, but it really has nothing to do with the hero and the mummy. It's more like, Oh, here's another powerful character you might just encounter again in another movie. (And as always, you've got the silliest ways to keep him trapped in his office - a big metal door that shuts bank-tight, yet all behind are glass windows that can be easily broken!!) The Mummy certainly starts off with Indiana Jones potential, underground with spiders and all all the way to the airplane crash, but after that, hiccups here and there to the end.Luckily, Miss Mummy does play her role decently well to keep the audience interested enough to want to know what more lies behind her powers. And there's enough unpredictable twists to keep everyone wondering, what's next, what's next. Certainly, the pacing is decently tight and goes like a Disney ride from one scene to the next.In the end, you get off, think that was cool looking, Miss Mummy is kinda cute, Cruise is still airbrushed/plastic surgery done up enough at his age to look handsome, and.... huh? What was the story again?Forgotten in a week and no reason to see it again.",The Mummy

Watching the Mummy gave me some of the most laugh out loud moments I ever had when watching at the cinema. I mean literally, the film is so bad that it tried to take itself seriously, I really cannot help but feel amazed that it ended up as a laughable work of art. Seriously? Tom cruise as the main star? A monster film that has the same tone as the Frighteners? This is awesome!!!!! Do not ever watch this movie if your expecting a technical film, just watch it if you expect a dumb film with no story line and no narrative to give it emotional weight. This movie is just hilariously stupid, it was well worth my time just for laughs XD!!",The Mummy

675,dan6288,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: The Mummy (2017)",6,11 June 2017,"The Good: The Hollywood Reporter recently headlined an article, ""It's time for Tom Cruise to Act his Age"", in which the author Josh Spiegel writes, "", Cruise these days feels more comfortable running himself ragged to prove he hasn't aged out of action movies yet."". But Mr. Spiegel, you are so, so, wrong. Mr. Cruise is not trying to prove he hasn't aged out of action movies yet. Mr. Cruise won't age out of action for a long time, and if The Mummy is any indication, he will still find ways to wow us. In fact, that's exactly why Cruise is one of the last great action hero filmmakers. A line that can be drawn directly back to Charlie Chaplin. Have you heard Cruise talk in length about making movies? He's a total geek. Might I even say an ""auteur"". Cruise represents one of the few producers who knows an audience wants to see the star's face doing those jaw-dropping stunts. (Kevin Costner is one of the few others). Cruise wants you to have a good time. He wants you to suspend your belief. Which is why he completely commits to his roles and has such a famous work ethic. No matter how bad a movie is, if Tom Cruise is in it, he is always going to be part of the good. And in the Mummy, he does not disappoint. His character, Nick, is boyish, funny, and rude. And once the other-worldly curse begins to take hold, we are 100% game to watch him fall out of the sky, get ripped out of a moving van, jump through a bus, and yes, fight an Irish-cockney Russell Crowe.The Bad: Critics would lead you to believe this film is ALL bad. They are wrong. I would rather rate a movie of what it is, not what a critic wants it to be. This movie, much like the classics it originates from, is a hardcore expensive B-movie. This means you will not get slow-building scene work drenched in subtext or an emotional core that will bring you to your knees. What you get is dark twisty humor mixed with 90s cliché' and a modern take on the mythology of all those monsters you've come to know. Our female lead, Annabelle Wallis, is unfortunately flat, providing nothing more than a plot propelling damsel in distress. (Disappointing step backwards given Cruise's and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie's terrific job with Rebecca Ferguson's character in MI: Rogue Nation). The only true bad is the disastrous expositional dialogue throughout and it's equally horrendous delivery by the usually very funny Jake Johnson. But what truly tops the bad list is the post-production sound mix and editing. The sound mix seemed incomplete, not adding the needed treble to give that extra boost to the action scenes. The editing is strange. I can only imagine the editors (yup, three of 'em) were struggling with what they had. The production's rush job to develop it's own universe may answer why there is such a terrible lack of continuity from shot to shot and misplaced levels pacing throughout.The Ugly: Contrary to what filmmaker Alex Kurtzman has stated, this is not a standalone film. It's a film setting-up for more Mummy movies and more importantly setting up the Dark Universe. And I love it. The Dark Universe seems to incorporate these characters that share the same past as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but does it on it's own terms and with the added delight of taking place in present times. Russell Crowe is a blast to watch as Dr. Jekyll and the smaller easter eggs alluding to other well-known characters is fun to find throughout. Like I mentioned before, this is a 90s film, and I love it for that. It's taking these classic ""monsters"" and updating them to the current superhero mytho we've come to accept as a movie going nation. They should take DCEU's path, don't let critics scare you off, keep plowing ahead until it clicks. Now, unlike DCEU, the money in ticket sales might not be there, but even if Universal breaks even, I hope they have the balls to keep moving forward with this planned Universe.",The Mummy
676,glen_goldsmith,Okay if you are the target audience 12 years old,3,1 September 2017,"To start and be clear I am older than your average bear, as such I watched Hammer house of horror and old Dracula,Frankenstein, Werewolves and the beloved Mummy I enjoyed them all, camp, tongue in cheek fun horror, the actors were all old stage or silent movie stars who were face actors. They could scare you but want to make you laugh at the same time. Also I enjoyed the Brenden Fraser 1999 version a great mix of old fashion horror and Indiana Jones, sad to say this current version is not very good which is sad as I like Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe.. Tom Cruise has no comedic timing, so cannot be serious and get that tongue in cheek look at the camera that tells you this is just a film, he can do it for action movies but this is meant to be a horror movie and his moments didn't fit the action or sequence. Russell Crowe as the head of the monster hunters would have been okay if he wasn't also Jekyll and Hyde ridiculous and stupid not Russell specifically the idea, it just didn't work. Hyde was Psychopath and not a cockney with bad veins... The writer must have been the same age as the certificate to come up with that idea, have they never read Penny Dreadful s or watched Extraordinary Gentlemen, they were better ideas. So if Universal want a successful franchise they need to step up, the target audience shouldn't be 12 and so the writing shouldn't fit that age, it should be intelligent and mature and aim for an older audience. Next is The Bride of Frankenstein, remember Universal Frankenstein was not the monster (or was he) he was the genius Doctor who bought a dead person back to life his name was Adam and the Bride Elizabeth, bet they get that wrong...",The Mummy

682,NightChild-792-522294,The Mummy was action packed thrill ride from start to finish!,8,3 November 2017,"Okay, so to start things off right...because it seems Ramascreen is off to a bad start with that review and other critics like Craig James had an outright disastrous start to this Mummy review as well. However, they weren't the only ones...The Mummy (2017) is an exciting film and a great kickoff to the Dark Universe (better than the ""Monsterverse"" people were calling it). Tom Cruise was acting like Tom Cruise does in all his action roles. You either like it or love it...if you hate it, then don't watch it or ignore it for the sake of watching a good action movie. Sofia Boutella was outstanding, yet a sexy villain (boy could she ruin my life with a dagger and a ritual...), the supporting cast consisting of Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson were also on point. Jake Johnson giving the comedic role in case things got way too serious was a good take. Annabelle was great to watch and for once, wasn't just an annoying damsel in distress with some annoying scream. Crowe's part wasn't unnecessary, but definitely short lived on screen time. After all, this was a movie about The Mummy, not Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Some people can't be happy no matter what you give them and everyone loves a popular bandwagon to jump on. Ask anyone who wrote a bad review, right Timothy and Bardockm? I mean anyone who can call this movie cheesy and hokey, but praises Brandon Fraser's Mummy films is clearly a pile of hot garbage...like their opinions...just saying...right corpsehoarder who hordes no corpses?

But they take the wrong step at every attempt they make in this movie. First off, the characters are the worst, except Tom Cruise's, as he is probably the best part of this movie. The story is also kind-of messy. They try to shoe-horn every single reference that they could in this mess they call ""The Mummy"" to the eventual ""The Dark Universe"", that it fails in saying a coherent story. The screenplay also is really, unforgivably bad. It seems like I am trashing this movie more than it deserves so, let's talk about the things that make this movie worth a while. Tom Cruise is great in this movie, as in every movie he is. The action sequences are exciting enough to entertain you.. and that's it. This movie is a complete mess guys, there is no quality here.

685,anunciata-trixie,"Basically, I want my money back",4,31 July 2017,"I know how much effort went into making this film, which is why I would like to say first and foremost that the CGI is really good and Sofia Boutella is absolutely beautiful. Also, I really like her make- up. Seriously, she looks gorgeous even as a corpse. I watched the Mummy for two reasons. One, because I absolutely adore Sofia Boutella and her amazing performance in Kingsman -- which I've watched like thirty times -- had spurred the existence of my desire to watch more and more films with her as one of the cast members. Two, because the TV Series Shadowhunters promoted it, and I'm a sucker for Shadowhunters. Long story short, I went to the cinemas with one of my best friends, bought the tickets, watched the film, and when the end credits started rolling up, the first thing that passed through my mind was, ""Freaking finally."" The second? ""I want my money back."" My friend and I actually turned our heads to each other and voiced that exact sentence at the exact same time. Yup, that's how much I don't like the movie. Remember the film ""Mummy"" with Brendan Fraser, cool fight sequences, awesome well-rounded characters, and a plot that doesn't really make sense except that it does and it draws you in like a quicksand? Yeah, don't expect anything like that watching this newly revamped version. This one has the same name and a thousand years old villain, but that's where the similarity ends, really. The producers, script writers, actors, and basically everyone involved in the making of this film also really need to check and recheck their source material. I cannot begin to describe how I angry I was when Set is referred to, repeatedly, if I may add -- including by the supposed archaeologist and Egyptian history expert -- as the ""God of Death"". He is NOT the God of Death. He is the Egyptian god of storms, deserts, desert, foreigners, and violence. All of which could cause death, of course, but there's also a god of crocodiles and crocodiles kill too!",The Mummy
686,abbiefrancessmith,"Sorry Tom, This Isn't Your Genre",3,15 June 2017,"Firstly, I admit to being a HUGE fan of the 1999 Mummy, and whilst that may have made me slightly biased going into seeing this film, it definitely was not the soul reason that I received it so poorly.At the very opening of this film I was actually intrigued, it opens with the burying of a Knight in the 14th century and then flashes forward to his tomb being found in modern day UK, and to be perfectly honest, I was just impressed that Hollywood was attempting to start this story without any narration. Enter Russell Crowe's character and narration. Unlike Imohtep, there is no real back story to this Mummy. She was essentially a princess about to lose her throne so she slaughtered her whole family. To do this she first made a deal with Set, the God of Death and became... possessed by evil? Yep, she's evil before she's even mummified, and apparently alive and powerful the whole time that she is buried, subdued only by mercury.Fast forward to present day Iraq (no, none of the main action takes place in Egypt) and Tom Cruise's character attempting to find the coordinates written on a piece of paper he stole from Annabelle Wallis' character. Obviously, they find the place, there is the Mummy, they bring her back to England and everything goes awry.Now, if you want to know about the powers of the Mummy I cannot tell you as the film never fully explains them, nor her weaknesses. Apparently she has control over all spiders and can call the sands of Egypt to London but can also be taken out by a tranquilizer dart. This even happens twice in the movie, the first time as a way of explaining her burial, and the second in order to stall the plot for 20 minutes whilst Russell Crowe comes back and the existence of the Dark Universe is set up. All of this makes for a pretty dull and confusing viewing experience, however, the worst element of the script might be the totally forced and unnecessary love story between Cruise and Wallis' character, as well as the fact that Wallis contributes absolutely nothing to the film. If you deleted her character completely the only thing that would change is the ridiculous ending (and this would only be a good thing). On the positive side, some of the action sequences are creative and the film is overall very well shot (as it should be with this budget) and this is where Cruise shines as he is a great action actor. However, any attempts and humour or horror feel completely out of place in Mission Impossible with a Mummy and it was the mix of these two elements in 1999 which made that movie a good watch. This version takes itself way too seriously, and if this is the direction that Universal plans to take with other films in the Dark Universe then it would probably save everyone a lot of time and money if they quit whilst they're behind.",The Mummy
687,mirandavanrijssen,Had much potential,6,3 August 2017,"I liked it overall. The FX were great, the sets were awesome and there was a lot of action.Sofia was definitely my favorite 'part' of the movie. She was perfectly cast and her acting was great.But I feel like this started out as an idea during a meeting and everyone got so excited about the idea that they didn't put enough time in writing a full story and script. The script feels a bit bland, and it feels like there are some plot holes in the movie. I wish they would've gone a little deeper with the story instead of focusing on the FX. At some point they even tried to bring in a bit of comedy which felt very out of place. You want to see this movie to get scared, not to laugh.Overall, enjoyable but don't expect too much",The Mummy

I can't even begin pointing out all the absurd things that happen in this movie, because this review will be more than 10,000 words.

689,diegopp-51779,"Not terrible, but certainly not great.",6,10 June 2017,"If I had to describe ""The Mummy"" in one word, it would be ""enjoyable"". Because while the film isn't as bad as critics would have you believe, it definitely isn't great either.The main problem with the film would be, I think, the directing. It's awful: Acting is very uneven; while Russell Crowe and Sofia Boutella rock their roles as Dr. Henry Jekyll and Princess Ahmanet respectively, the rest of the cast feels either wasted (Courtney B. Vance), miscast (Tom Cruise), badly acted (Jake Johnson), or all three (Annabelle Wallis). The tone of the film was also uneven (sometimes it was like the film wanted to be a horror thriller and the next second it felt like an action-packed blockbuster). All in all, directing was the main fault of this film not being as good as it could have been. Another problem was the movie's wanting to serve as an introduction to Universal's Dark Universe. It focused so much on that, that it forgot we went to see ""The Mummy"" and not ""Dark Universe: Origins"". Editing was also pretty terrible, the musical score was forgettable, and the script mediocre. It's not all bad things, though. What stands out the most to me are the two performances I already mentioned: Russell Crowe and Sofia Boutella (particularly the first). They are amazing in their roles and are a joy to watch. CGI is also pretty great in some parts (in some others, not so much), and there are some satisfyingly shocking moments that you'd expect from a film like this.Summarizing: ""The Mummy"" is an entertaining movie. But if you go watch it expecting a masterpiece, you'll be disappointed. Expect a ""meh"" film. Let's hope the rest of the ""Dark Universe"" is better.",The Mummy

691,sarahpass,Let down,2,20 June 2017,"To all saying this is nothing like Brendan Frasers 'The Mummy' Yes, yes it is. I was excited to see this, from the trailers I was under the impression it was dark, dramatic, a bit scary and full of suspense. The reality was further from the truth than you could possibly imagine. Tom Cruise' character Nick, is basically Brendan Frasers character Rick. An arrogant Lothario who relies on eyebrow raises and silly one liners for 'comedy' The female lead (not interested enough to learn her real, or character, name) was a typical American version of a stuffy, stuck up Brit, only she's played by an American actress, so her boarding school accent kept slipping into her native sound regularly. The story-line idea, how the mummy came to be, was great-even if it's basically just a gender reversed version of Frasers version, but the story that followed was ridiculous. I get that they're trying to do a whole reboot and have a dark universe franchise follow, but sticking Jekyll and Hyde in this was both completely random and nonsensical. He was totally irrelevant to the story, and it felt like he was there purely to open the door for other movies to follow. I can honestly say, I haven't been this disappointed in a film since 'open water' And this marks only the second time I've left the cinema before a film finished. My advice? Just don't bother-but I'm not a dictator, so go make up your own minds. Just don't go expecting drama and suspense.",The Mummy
692,malynnkiss,Rating would be higher if it weren't for Russell Crowe,7,15 June 2017,"As a fan of classic monster movies, and Tom Cruise, plus knowing critics tend to be more critical of movies in the horror genre, I decided, once again, to ignore the bad to mediocre reviews for a movie I was looking forward to, and I'm very happy I did as ""The Mummy"" is the kind of fun entertaining summer movie you want to enjoy on the big screen. IMO great classic monster movies should have an interesting story, make you jump in your seat, and have a great creepy or scary monster. A monster that is so interesting (like on a ""ooh, he's so creepy"" level) that you find yourself kind of hoping that the monster is not destroyed so you can see more movies with that monster. Well, The Mummy delivers on all of those, so I recommend fans of monster movies, or the horror genre (not the gore kind), go see this movie in a theater. You will have fun watching it. I thought Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Jake Johnson were excellent in the movie. IMO Russell Crowe was the weakest character in the movie. I know he's an Oscar winner, and I enjoy many of his movies, but IMO he is just not right for the classic character he plays in this movie. If Universal is going to re-do all of their beloved classic monster movies, then the audience should leave feeling like each character from those classic monster movies, that we've just watched again, was either more interesting, or more creepy, in their newest film, than the original; however, when it comes the classic character Russell Crowe plays, I can think of at least 2 other performances of the same character from the days of black and white movies, that were a much creepier, so for me Crowe's longest scene in the movie was the weakest, least entertaining, part of the film, but other than that, I really enjoyed The Mummy, and am really looking forward to all that Universal has to offer us in the coming years in their new ""Dark Universe"" movies. NOTE: At the end of the movie, while there are no extra scenes, there are some really neat photographs, possibly important, displayed on the screen, so stay to see those and pay attention to them... good stuff for the sleuth minded. :)",The Mummy

Good night out at the movies but nothing memorable whatsoever.A big issue with this movie is that there are tons of clichés. The whole intro, story, some of the lines used have just been so over done, there really is nothing new about it. Many things also weren't explained very well and the 'in movie exposition' was too convenient. Wasn't Tom Cruises best work either, he was a pretty typical Tom Cruisey character but worse than other movies I've seen him in, he's getting a bit old to play the 'playboy'. The female leads and side character dude were probably the highlights. Worst part about the movie was the ending. Don't make a movie that will resolve/explain itself in a sequel, when the first movie hasn't proved its actually good. Maybe you have ideas in mind for the sequel and thats cool, but The Mummy basically feels like one story broken up into 2 movies. Super random and just leaves you unsatisfied at the end.Don't have a tone of positives except that it did a solid job at being a typical 'B' movieIt had a few almost thriller like moments so maybe avoid if you scare really easily.",The Mummy
694,bigbeatrocks,Sofia Is Captivating,10,4 September 2017,"The latest incarnation of The Mummy seems a little disjointed at times; and an awkward subplot doesn't help the continuity. The humor, while not bad, tended to weaken the sense of drama the film strives for. Also, there are too many dreary scenes for my taste.So after it was over I was thinking about the experience. My feeling was that the film had obvious weaknesses... but I could not deny that I enjoyed it. Maybe a guilty pleasure type of thing. There were some vague impressions of beauty from the film that lingered in my mind, and surfaced from time to time. So, about a month later I was at the theater to see a different movie, but decided to watch The Mummy again instead. This time it blew my mind.I felt the production values were high, and the music was evocative- those things are very important for this type of film. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he is rather likable as an actor, and I think he did a fine job here.What I like about 'mummy' movies in general are the (however slight or great) aspects of history which are usually part of the story, and the sense of mystery, suspense, drama, and perhaps even dread which are inherent to the genre.What I especially like about 'The Mummy' 2017 is Sofia Boutella.First, I have to say that those who did her hair, makeup and wardrobe deserve very high praise. The ""look"" they created for The Mummy isn't really frightening, but it is arresting. Sofia is just about perfect for the role of Ahmanet. Her face, her body type, and the way she uses her body (she's been a dancer since she was 5 years old) are completely appropriate for her character. She delivers her lines very well but her effectiveness as an actress goes way beyond speech. She exudes desire, malice, ambition, purpose, pathos, and surprisingly: vulnerability. She is evidently the most evil character in the story, but I couldn't help but love her, and feel a certain amount of compassion for her. She's a lost soul whose destiny is... destruction. Poor baby.",The Mummy
695,dcruize_csc,A real Mummy's boy,9,25 June 2017,"Tom Cruise was great as usual in this action blockbuster; but he was almost upstaged by Sofia as the Mummy, a true classic villainess visibly oozing evil that, when the dust has settled, should go down as one of the great all time horror embodiments.The other leading lady, Annabelle Wallis, was reasonably pretty but came across more as an ex-model than a bone fide A-list actor, unlike Tom and Sofia, but Annabelle, as Jenny Halsey, clearly has some guts, in real life as well as the film, as the zero gravity footage in the plane was a real humdinger! I love it when high profile actors do their own gobsmackable stunts instead of relying on the ubiquitous green screen and the inherent mediocrity of CGI in a stunt situation.That being said, the CGI in this film, which seemed to be mainly created by George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic was first rate, and the monster effects were genuinely awesome. Suffice it to say that Ahmanet isn't alone in inflicting an assault on Nick Morton, Jenny Halsey and many others in modern day London, and there is an underwater sequence that comes close to being as thrilling as the zero gravity sequence on the plane.I saw the beginning of one of the Brendan Frazer Mummy movies on TV - I don't know which one - and that was pure slapstick as far as I'm concerned and could have been done much better by the Marx Brothers. Also, I'm not a fan of either Brendan Frazer - whom these days I would have to style a cinematic Neville no name - and I'm not very fond of Rachael Weiz either: whom I always think of as Jude Law's 'bolshie' girlfriend from 'Enemy at the Gate'.Admittedly the climactic scene is comparatively brief, but I think that adds to its shock value given the enormity of what transpires as the vicious and evil but beautiful Mummy finally obtains the object of her age old struggle and desire; her 'chosen'.",The Mummy
696,igorretz,Lazy Hollywood writing at its worst,3,25 August 2017,Not a single relatable character in the movie -- a bunch of random people with no story and no personality run around doing some random stuff you couldn't care less about.I literally started to doze off half-way through the film and all I wanted to do is to turn down the volume because it was getting really loud and annoying. Such a waste of money and acting talent!,The Mummy
697,Etoopia,"Awful, Silly, Boring.....Universal failed attempt to copy Marvel",3,10 June 2017,"It seems to me Universal has seen Disney produce MCU , which is ultra successful...Fox with its X-Men cinematic Universe....Warner Bros with its DC Cinematic universe and even though the DC movies are awful, they still make bank. So Universal decided to use that comic book movie blue print and use it for their monster movies. Universal owns the rights to Dracula, Wolfman, Frankenstein, and the Mummy with many more. So they quickly signed the biggest stars they could get for the movies including Johnny Depp for Invisible Man, Javier Bardem for Frankenstein, and Russell Crowe for Dr. Jeckyl. When figuring out where to begin, they started with The Mummy and signed one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of all time - Tom Cruise for the title role. The idea is he would be the 'Robert Downey' of this franchise, appearing in future movies. Despite the quality of the films, Cruise would get a massive pay day and still be relevant in the business even though he is in his mid-50s. When going into The Mummy, I knew it would be a Marvel knock off in certain elements, but had no idea they would try to copy Marvel beat for beat.The Tone - They tried to copy Marvel by being an adventure movie, action movie, romance movie, and COMEDY ! Why does this not work - because they its suppose to be the original horror films of cinema history. HORROR and comedy make it a goofball movie. They wanted to go PG-13, have action pieces, and horror elements, but wanted to stop the movie for jokes and one liners like Marvel. And they were bad. Like REALLY bad jokes. Poorly timed. Horrible execution.The Characters - Simply a joke. Tom Cruise plays Nick Morton, an unlikable scavenger who is chosen by the Mummy to put some soul into his body because he's so youthful and handsome despite the fact he's mid-50's and filmmakers need to CGI reduce his age. The chemistry behind Cruise and the female lead (whos name I have no idea) is awful. The audience doesn't care. Cruise saves her like four times throughout the movie and that is suppose to be the excuse why you're suppose to like the character at the end. But it falls flat because the characters have no chemistry, nothing happens between them. In Iron Man, you have Tony being cocky and does not want to settle down, but Pepper Potts is the one woman he has a special place in his heart, but Pepper wants him to change first. It works. Its good chemistry. There are scenes that depict this. In The Mummy, IT IS NOT DEPICTED AT ALL. Lets talk about Cruise sidekick. So he gets cursed by the Mummy and has one eye for no reason. Then he is suppose to scare the audience because he is now a zombie ghost who can only talk to Cruise. But since this movie has no tone, the zombie ghost who is suppose to scare you, turns into a comic relief ! Its SO out of place. And the worst part is at the end, he suddenly is just back to life riding a horse with Tom Cruise. I'm not making this up. The character writing was so all over the place.The Villain - The Mummy was cliché. She was some Queen who was evil, and comes back to do .... something. I got to be honest, I'm not really sure what her plans were after she stabbed Cruise and put the soul into him. Was she going to take over the world ? I have no idea. Anyway, she runs around with bad CGI until she sucks enough cops souls to make her a hot woman, and then Dr. Jeckyl captures her and then they start explaining, explaining, out of place humor and then Tom Cruise fights Dr. Jeckyl because Universal wants you to know they are capable of crossing over monsters. Yes, this is a real thing.The Ending - I predicted Tom Cruise would turn into the Mummy for future movies. I could predict that from the trailer. I thought no way they'd let Sofia be the Mummy in the rest of the franchise, they need that Robert Downey to run the franchise, so they have Cruise. And I was right...well sort of..... Its so cheap at the end. Tom Cruise gets some mummy-like powers at the end of the film and u don't see his face anymore, I guess this is to prove he is a mummy. So then he just rides off on a horse, with his hands wrapped like a mummy, nothing else, just his hands, i guess to show the audience ""hey, cruise is now the mummy, please come back to see more of our monster dark universe"". But he's really not a Mummy because he's no buried or coming back from the dead or anything. Its really awful.Comparison to 1999 Film - The Branden Fraser 1999 movie is 100x better than this film. I'll tell you why.... The 1999 film knew what it was and had its tone. It was a fun, dumb, mindless adventure film that was meant to be watched with popcorn. It had good comedy elements, good adventure, good horror elements. It knew what it was and it was cheesy, but fun cheese. This movie had no idea what it wanted to be, it was just Universal desperate attempt to become successful like Disney / Marvel. And it showed. The script was written by 6 people. It wanted to please everyone and when you try to please everyone, you please no one. It wanted to appeal to the monster fans, it failed. It wanted to appeal to the Marvel fans, it failed because it was not Marvel. After seeing this, I don't want to watch any of these movies again. I do want to watch the 1999 film again because I remember it being fun.",The Mummy
698,jameymessina,Meh,4,10 June 2017,If you liked the last Mummy movies you'll probably like this.

The story line is old school mummy, yet had enough new twists to make it hard to see what was coming next. I am a movie fanatic and so its easy in most movies to see whats coming next. The woman that plays The Mummy was absolutely fantastic, she was scary, sexy, and really saved this movie. Tom Cuise was his usual self, the effects were good to great, and it left a lot of unanswered questions. I guess that's for the sequels, lol.We watched it with my entire family 10 people and not on of them thought it was a bad movie. In addition, the movie theater was mostly full.",The Mummy

Even subtle elements (small spoiler in coming) where sands of Eygypt called forth in central London but every piece of glass shatters and becomes dust- glass - silica - sand etc etc There's a fair few zombies and I think this movie was before people got hooked on walking dead etc so this maybe where the film lost people but honestly, it's a decent film.",The Mummy
702,aabucha,"Entertaining movie, worth the ticket.",7,12 June 2017,"First of all, let me tell you where I come from: Interstellar, The Prestige, Inception and all of Nolan's films are plain amazing. Other great screenplay writers AND directors are art in motion. And I mean these guys: Damien Chazelle (La la land, Whiplash), James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy 2), Shawn Black (The Nice Guys; Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Very Entertaining movies examples: Marvel Universe Franchise (Except First Captain America), M.I. Franchise, Edge of Tomorrow, Devils Advocate, Saving Private Ryan, Back To The Future's, How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days (best chick flick hands down), Love Actually, John Wick. Bad movies examples: Batman vs. Superman, Fifty Shades of Grey and Darker, Jackie, Transformers: Age of Extinction.Now that already said, The Mummy is very entertaining, worth paying the ticket.Good story structure 7/10.Screenplay was okay 6/10: You will laugh at some of the punchlines with your buddies as you exit the theatre; few other lines you'll quote over the weekend. Just a few.Characters/acting are simple but well defined 7.5/10: They are defined in the movie by each of their personality traits. Sofia Boutella plays a very interesting/sexy/strong villain that can cover the whole screen and give you chills while making you ""interested""? Kudos to her. Tom Cruise's characters is all over the place (opposed to as Ethan Hunt's Mission Impossible, for example) - simple but well acted. Russel Crowe plays a dark cynical man (The Nice Guys' Jackson Healy, but darker) - love that guy. Jake Johnson was 'OK' as a comic relief. Annabelle Wallis was...OK - she's starting in Hollywood so I think she needs some slack for the next 5 years with her acting performance. Action, suspense and horror sequences 10/10: The motion of the movie will have you every second of the movie grabbing to your chair. You will have your scares, and then bounce into action, and then back to suspense. Well played sequences to keep you forgetting your daily lame job and wishing Tom Cruise can survive/finally beat the crazy determined grey-skinned psycho chick.Andres' gives the Mummy a 'must watch on a theatre' rank.Now why the bad reviews all over the web?

703,terrynz-16078,Very close to being rated a B movie,4,8 June 2017,"Only due to some A-list actors is this movie prevented from falling into the B grade. Mind you, it was a narrow escape, as it seemed there was a lot of over acting by even the A-listers. I suspect the blame for over acting lies squarely at the director's feet. The storyline was jagged, no fluidity to it.Oh sure it had some good moments (and some funny ones) and the special effects (not so much in your face but always there) propped it up but without a good story there is only so much that special effects and A-listers can do.The end was somewhat of an anti-climax and left the story very much open to continuation. Let us hope that the next film learns from its past mistakes.I was disappointed in it as it never met expectations and proves that having A-listers does not guarantee success. I suspect in time both Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe will have wished they never featured in it, definitely not one of their best moments.",The Mummy

I don't know. i was drawn into the story at the beginning all the way up to the plane crash.Then it got weird. So now I'm watching Russle Crowe's character introduction like..?..hold on let me pause it. Okay...i just paused it at the scene where Russel Crowe is fighting Tom Cruise. What i get is Russle Crowe and the chick are in cahoots to destroy any Egyption evil. Tom Cruise is somehow possessed and doesn't know what the hell is going on. So my first question is why would he so quickly drink a glass of liquid giving to him by Russle Crowe? Didn't you just get shot in the chest with a dart, fell asleep, woke up dumb founded.. and then take a shot of who knows what? Strange. This ancient Egyptian chick comes back from centuries of exile in cave which Tom Cruise discovered. And she gets trapped by chains in a room set up by Russel Crowe and his peoples. WTF? How you as an ancient Egyptian super evil entity that comes back alive and get caught and trapped by some chains?? ? again. Okay I'm bout to un-pause it. Hold on...okay I'm back..nah i don't like it.

Well it was a good try by the production committee to cast an established and popular Tom Cruise for the main role but for god's sake his character was totally out of track. We don't get the chance to see his character developing nor the other ones except Sofia Boutella's role Ahamet. The plot was really bad to be honest and we don't get the Adrenalin and the shipment for the survival of the characters like that of the previous mummy franchise. The directors couldn't get a hold of what Ahamet powers could be like without getting the audience to go ""this is ridiculous"". For me the ending was terrible too. If dark universe is to rebuild another horror action tape, they better come up with a fitting cast as well as an admirable screen play and plot so that can really make the ticket buyers feel that they watched a peculiar dark universe movie.",The Mummy

I'm a huge fan of the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies, but honestly this movie was not that bad. In fact, it was better than what most people gave it credit for. Personally, I believe these so called ""critics"" blew it way out of proportion and basically didn't give it a chance all because it was Tom Cruise as the hero instead of Fraser and Sofia Boutella as the villain instead of Arnold Vosloo. It was a fresh reboot and gave us a good look at Jekyll and Hyde (played by Russell Crowe). But, hey I can't change others opinions on this movie. I enjoyed it. It was an exciting and adrenaline rush movie, good bit of action and Tom Cruise was great as was Boutella and Annabelle Wallis.

I understood the story line, it made me want go to any series showings, I jumped a couple of times and I'm old enough to remember old mummy movies. Hey folks!!! Just go for the action entertainment value, action part, actors did their part.. it was good to great.

It just kills something deep inside of me (I'm not saying that the protagonist in this film dies, btw). So eventually I decided that I would look up any film which I am about to watch and read the plot on Wikipedia, but just the end as to see what happened to the protagonist, or any other character that I care about.When I read the end of ""The Mummy,"" I was left a little confused. The concept of the film and the fact that it starred Tom Cruise had me hooked in, but the 16% Rotten Tomatoes score along with the confusing ending of which I read on Wikipedia had me slightly cautious. I decided to watch it, and I was absolutely blown away. This is one movie where I actually enjoyed the antagonist, Sofia Boutella did an amazing job portraying the arisen princess Ahmanet. Tom Cruise's character, Nick Morton, was absolutely amazing, like Tom Cruise always is. Cruise is neck-in-neck with Ryan Reynolds and Harrison Ford for my favorite actor, and he didn't dissapoint here. Russell Crowe played both Jekyll and Hyde, and his character was absolutely amazing. The one complaint I have is I wish Jake Johnson's Chris Vail would have had a bigger role in the movie. I loved his character, and it was sad that he didn't screen time as I would have liked.Before I watched this movie, I was expecting it to be good; not great, just good. Now I've seen it multiple times, and it's one of my top 3 favorite movies. I just don't understand how this film was hated by both critics and regular moviegoers such as myself.

711,ult_avatar,What a joke ! What a mess !,1,28 September 2017,"In this reboot of the classic from 1999, nothing seems to fit.They cannot even get the basic Egyptian mythology right - most prominent example - Seth is the God of violence, chaos, disorder. Not the god of ""death"" - that would be Osiris ! In fact, in ancient Egyptian mythology Seth killed Osiris... how can you be so wrong about something so simple ?The design of the artifacts and sarcophagus looks nothing like ancient Egypt - the writing on the princesses skin even less so.Ahmanet is not ancient Egyptian..The Egyptians did not use mercury, that was pre-Aztec South America and China..The list goes on and on..The casting choices were a horrible mix. No chemistry at all. Tom Cruise cannot shake his ""Ethan Hunt""-look even for a minute and Russel Crowe's fake, over-the-top, British accent was just cringy. Also, the director seems to have Jake Johnson just repeat lines from ""New Girl"".The plot makes no sense at all: The princess conjures Seth in a plea for power and Seth offers her a deal - but we never get the now what here end of the bargain is ? She gets super natural powers but is captured and imprisoned very fast - with Seth seems okay with. No punishment for the failure to give Seth a presence on Earth. Also, she could have killed the Pharaoh and his son without Seth - what was the plan here ? If she and Seth-incarnate where god-like - why kill them at all ?At least in the 1999 version, there was a plot of betrayal, love and the bad guys had clear motive and some redeeming qualities. Also, the whole restoration of the mummy to ""human"" form was more fun, with the hunt for the internal organs and so on..Ah, and the magical scene where Tom Cruises character resurrects his love interest by screaming at her to ""get up"" - magical.Really, not fun to watch, not entertaining... just garbage",The Mummy

So first of all this movie has a lot of 'suddenness'.
SPOILER ALERT
What I mean by 'suddenness' is that... Let me see. So the mummy almost stabs Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) But then Jenny suddenly comes in (It is also unknown how Jenny found the church) and the mummy freezes(She could have stabbed Nick) and then she walks up to Jenny and then punches her.
But before that, they were in a desert with bad people who destroy things with guns. Nick Morton suddenly pulls out a map (He doesn't know why he has it). They then start to get shot and stuff. Then suddenly this plane flies over and drops a big ass bomb and BOOM!!! And then the mummy treasure was revealed.
This part isn't a spoiler. so you can read.
So if you didn't read the spoiler there are 2 options. To watch or not. If you want action and adventure but you don't care about the story watch it.
If you want logic in your movies and goodness and epic-ness then I consider you not to watch it. A good suggestion might be err... The other mummy the 1999 one with Brendan Fraser and stuff that should be a better one with more logic.

720,striplay,That was actually really good. You people saying otherwise must be crazy.,9,7 August 2019,"-Potential spoilers-This is EASILY the best film of the series imo.
Fantastic actors/actresses team up for a mash-up of monster types, and it works.
Despite what the naysayers cry about, this film is engaging, entertaining, and very well filmed.
The characters aren't performing overly ridiculous feats, and the main enemy is not only beautiful, but immensely intense, and powerful enough to not be overwhelmed by something silly.
Which I loved.
In the previous films, somehow the enemy would always be beaten in a way that's made the movie stupid.
Yet in this one, she was not able to be overpowered by mere mortals.
Which was quite refreshing.
I loathe when a powerful adversary is seemingly unable to defeat mediocre things and the humans are portrayed in at least some fashion as equal.
It makes it seem unrealistic within the surrounding environment.
It's definitely a majour peeve of mine.I must also note just how satisfying it is to finally watch a mummy movie with actors that are actually able to act.
Unlike Brendan Frasier in the other films, Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella were superb.Honestly, the negative reviews on this must be made by teenagers or something, because what I watched, wasn't bad AT ALL.

Most of the dialog is predictable and there is no resolution or point to the story at all.

728,christiangarciacolon,Disappointing,5,22 August 2017,"Now that i re-watched it , let me give my thoughts on this mess called The Mummy (2017) and the whole Dark Universe crap. Dear Universal Studios Entertainment: Don't put your Universe before your characters. I don't mind you guys remaking The Mummy yet again. If i don't like it , i'll still have the previous versions. But you guys are missing the point. The original was a standalone/self contained movie. It wasn't trying to set up sequels or an unnecessary cinematic shared universe. In fact , there wasn't even a sequel. It was more horror. The ones that were made in the 40's and the 1999 remake and its sequels were more action/adventure , sure. But they knew what they were. They knew the tone they wanted. And i love those. This one , the tone didn't knew what it was. It wants to be more like the original 1932 version and distance itself from the 1999 version but at the same time it is doing stuff that , the 1999 version did and there are even references. But we don't need a shared universe. Don't try to copy Marvel because they aren't superheroes. They're monsters. What are they going to do once they get together ? Are they all of the sudden going to be friends and save humans ? There wasn't an after credits scene teasing. The whole movie was one big tease. It felt like Iron Man 2. A commercial for another movie. How about make new versions of Frankenstein , Dracula , The Hunchback Of Notre Dame , The Invisible Man and The Phantom Of The Opera that are actually more faithful to the original novels ? As a way to differentiate from the previous movie adaptations. I seriously doubt that the authors of those novels where thinking of shared universes when they were writing those. I doubt H.G. Wells was thinking ""You know what , The Invisible Man , this is set in the same universe of Dracula and The Mummy. And how about hire people with actual experience ? Alex Kurtzman was mostly a writer and had only directed 1 film. Just one. And it was a small Comedy | Drama movie. Why would you give this big budget/summer/popcorn/action/adventure/horror movie to this guy ? Stephen Sommers was a writer too sure. But he directed 4 films prior to The Mummy. He directed a small movie and he went to direct other movies until he got Deep Rising which it was more a big budget movie. And then he made The Mummy. Get Guillermo Del Toro. Sam Raimi. James Wan , Peter Jackson. And drop the whole shared universe idea. You tried a few times and it didn't worked. Dracula Untold , now this one. Just forget it. I can't believe i'm saying this but i rather watch The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor. At least that wasn't trying to set a shared universe. And i actually cared for the main character. Unlike this one. The only reason i gave it the benefit of doubt was because of Tom Cruise. Regardless of what you think of his personal life , he's a good actor and producer. But i honestly didn't cared for his character. He was a jerk. He and the actress had no chemistry , unlike Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weiz. And Brendan Fraser was clearly a hero. He even tried to save Beni. In this one he saved the girl sure. He gave her the last parachute and we think he sacrificed himself for her , but then he said that he thought there was another parachute. Was that supposed to be funny ? And after , there was a scene where he tried to escape and he almost left the girl. He toked a truck and totally forgot about her. Our hero ladies and gentlemen. Our hero. I think i even rather watch The Mummy: The Animated Series.",The Mummy
729,jonnevaneck,"Too much Tom, not enough Mummy.",3,3 March 2019,"When I was 16, I saw The Mummy for the first time. And I loved it. The cast, the sets, the storyline, the scary mummy, it was a true adventure movie. Almost Indiana Jones calibre. So I admit I didn't watch this remake with an open mind. I didn't even bother to go to the cinema, but watched it on TV. But even with very low expectations I found this 2017 version disappointing.First there was Tom Cruise. Come on studio bosses, when are you going to stop casting him as a man from in his late 30's or early 40's? He is over 50! He clearly does his best to stay fit, but it's starting to become a bit unbelievable to see him in these kinds of roles. His love interest is at least 20 years younger. Also, his character is supposed to be a con man, but Tom has no edge. Why not cast a younger man who can play someone with a darker side? Tom Hardy, Jon Bernthal or Colin Farrel perhaps?In a movie with an interesting storyline I can tolerate Tom Cruise (I really enjoyed Edge of Tomorrow), but I just couldn't really get into this movie. Those crazy dream scenes, strange hurried transitions (from Iraq to England to the mortuary) and stiff dialogues, I couldn't go with the flow. And it didn't get scary either, while this film had to be the kick off of the Dark Universe.A final thought: where are the strong women in this film? In the 1999 version, Rachel Weisz was a super smart librarian. Clumsy but spunky. 20 years later, we get an uninteresting archaeologist whose name I have already forgotten. A shame of such a good actress who was excellent in Peaky Blinders. And poor Sofia Boutella who tried so hard to be scary. A female mummy sounds cool, but then we find out she needs a man to complete her destiny... Poor mummy, thousands of years in a sarcophagus, the most dangerous creature of antiquity and then you still need Tom Cruise to be free...In short, give me the scary mummy from 1999 and the chemistry of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz over this.Still, I hope this flop doesn't mean the end for the Dark Universe plans. I'm very curious to see The Bride of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man. Hopefully Bardem and Depp will do well and will be joined by some strong women.",The Mummy
730,noxious-living,Makes you side with the villains.,3,15 July 2017,"There are a lot of issues with this movie already addressed. But one of the major ones for me is, that the main characters, the mortal ones, are just not really likable. You hardly learn to know anything about them, the character development is hardly there and they seem bland and boring. Actually I tended to side with the mummy, Ahmanet, in the movie. And when she was beaten in the end, with a move, that was just implausible (Really? She did not notice him taking the dagger from her own friggin hand?!) I felt rather sad for her. Sure, she sucked out several people for her life force, but I would rather spend eternity at her side, as she promises, than seeing Tom Cruise trying so hard and failing...",The Mummy
731,Rate_that_genre,Yeah for the Universe...Nay to the cheese (needs more horror and suspense),8,7 June 2017,"I give this an 8, not because I think the film is super by any means...but because I am still hopeful. Universal Dark/Dark Universe has extreme promise for anyone that loves the B+W classics. Saying that - this first movie is nothing but recycled American cheese. Its like they merged Brendan Fraser's Mummy with Nicholson's A National Treasure and claimed it is 'something new'.As I said, I still remain hopeful.....but I am hopeful that there is less American cheese in the next one. I wish a British director like Nolan got his hands on this. This concept could have been nothing but suspense instead of cheese.I know it is hard to translate the original B+W movies for a modern audience, but they could have at least tried a Hitchcockian vibe. They could have brought in horror movie greats as producers. They could have tried a classic music score for it that would encompass the whole movie...but nothing.We have already had ""good family fun popcorn action movies""....more than we need with Fox, Marvel and DC.

733,aebars,"Abort this franchise while you still can, Universal",2,16 June 2017,"Thousands of years ago, the evil Egyptian princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) murders her family and attempts to use a magical dagger to perform a ritual to summon Set, the God of Death, into the world. As usual, of course, the royal guards catch her in the act, mummify her alive (yes, in the first five minutes, the movie is already ripping-off ideas from the Brendan Fraser trilogy...), and bury her in a tomb in Iraq. In the present day, cocky treasure hunter Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) unearths the tomb, and... well, frankly, even if you haven't seen the trailers, you can probably guess what happens next. Ahmanet's sarcophagus is carted back to the UK, where she escapes, and sets about reclaiming the dagger to try the ritual again. Tom Cruise gets superpowers, falls in with this secret government organisation that fights monsters, and endeavors to stop her. The end.'The Mummy', you are probably aware, is intended to kick-off a franchise featuring reboots of all the classic Universal monsters from the 30s. 2014's 'Dracula Untold' was originally slated to kick-off said franchise, but Universal de-canonized it on account of it, well, sucking so hard. I'm all for second chances, but if 'The Mummy' is what Universal offers when it gets one, all I can recommend is that Universal cancels this franchise before it's even started.'The Mummy' is a bland, limp, stale, clunky, boring, soulless movie - throughout, you can easily sense that it was made for no purpose other than to initiate a series, which in turn is being made for no purpose other than to make money. Neither the director, actors or screenwriter seem to give a rat's ass about the entire project. It contains nothing but generic CGI action sequences - there's not the faintest trace of either fear or excitement, none of the quiet suspense of the 1932 original or the campy fun of the Brendan Fraser series. The special effects, which are perhaps the one sphere in which it could have offered up something interesting and original, aren't anything you haven't seen a million times before - all shambling zombies and swarms of bugs and billowing clouds of sand pursuing after the protagonists. Any and all shots at humor fall flat as pancakes. Ahmanet is a forgettable non-villain, and Morton an even more forgettable non-hero - there is no way that such characters could carry a string of sequels. If something this blandtacular is what they do with the Mummy character, then I've absolutely no desire to see what they do with Count Dracula or Frankenstein's Monster. Not a damned thing about the movie works.Fool me once ('Dracula Untold'), shame on you. Fool me twice ('The Mummy'), shame on me. This franchise is not going to be viable, Universal. Follow through with it, and you're going to have a series of box office bombs on your hands. Please, for your sake, and ours, pull the plug on it this instant.",The Mummy

So, perhaps they miscast that role as well by choosing someone who was too good, who knows.

745,segasonic015,A Wasted Opportunity,1,14 June 2017,"The Mummy (2017) is supposed to kick off a major cinematic universe for Universal Pictures, based on their classic monsters. I guess I could claim that this universe (titled the ""Dark Universe"") would be the greatest missed opportunity for the studio, as The Mummy is a catastrophe of filmmaking, representing the worst of recent attempts to copy Marvel's formula. The film's greatest weakness is its atrocious screenplay and direction, lacking any sort of focus on character, story, and (especially) tone. The film holds very little reassurance when it begins; after a laughably forced logo for the Dark Universe (shortly after the Universal logo), the story unfolds with Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe) using exposition to tell us Ahmanet's origins, done with a fairly serious tone. While it could've avoided using exposition, it does work as a decent introduction. Once we're introduced to Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) and his friend/partner Vali, however, the film becomes more silly, focusing on spectacle and comedy. Throughout the rest of the feature, it keeps shifting between contrasting tones, never finding a proper middle ground and never performing any of its intended tones well. None of the characters are particularly interesting or likable; Nick Morton, is selfish and annoyingly cocky, with little charm or heart, even though he's supposedly a jerk with a heart of gold. He doesn't even have a proper arc to further develop his character, thus leaving little reason to care.Annabelle Wallis' character (not even bothering to remember the name) has no personality and barely contributes to the plot, aside from giving Nick someone else to talk to. Ahmanet, the Mummy herself, is just a one-note villain. Despite a decent performance by Sofia Boutella, Ahmanet gives little reason to sympathize or empathize with her, being too malicious and cruel; nor does she have any charisma or charm to make her interesting or scary as a villain. She's merely an obstacle for Cruise to face. A chunk of the run time is dedicated to Dr. Henry Jekyll (and his alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) and Prodigium, a S.H.I.E.L.D. knockoff that studies monsters and eradicates supernatural forces. While the idea is fascinating, it's just as forced, and ineffective as anything else in the script. Crowe ultimately becomes an exposition machine, with clunky dialogue to boot (a number of times he puts the word ""evil"" in a sentence is astounding), and his transformation to Mr. Hyde is forced and anticlimactic. They should've just made a separate movie for Jekyll and Prodigium, as that would give more time to develop said elements.What is competent, such as the special effects, score, and cinematography are bland, yet serviceable (though the plane scene slightly rises above this). Aside from Crowe, Boutella, and Johnson, no performance sticks out from also being serviceable, yet boring.Consensus: In the end, the whole film feels ill-conceived and unfinished as if it was an afterthought for the studio's plans. I wouldn't be too surprised (if a bit disappointed) that the Dark Universe dies from this film's failure, but it would be well- deserved.",The Mummy

I'm not a Marvel or DC fan at all so i was expecting more of the same with the whole 'universe' concept, however.. this film had me gripped right the way through. It kept cheesy one liners to a minimum (at least until nearer the end) and was actually quite scary in parts! It had a nice dark feel throughout and i was really impressed by the mummies / zombies, the direction was very clever in that shadows were used effectively and the movements of the creatures were genuinely disturbing at times. A lot of people are saying that Cruise isn't suited to the role, i agreed for the first minute but as soon as i adjusted and got to terms with the fact that this was not the old mummy series i appreciated his performance and thought he he played it well.

But the movie succeed to create some some elements, the two most important being : the sandstorm in London (make by destroying glasses) or the fact that the mummy uses death people to fight humans at the end. But elements like the doctor are totally useless, or a graphically beautiful idea but useless : when the sand take the form of the mummy face.

I am still standing by my original post below (check it out, it's a good read), but I want to tell you all one more time THE MUMMY F'ING ROCKSS!!!!!!! ROXXXX! THE CRITICS R DICS!!!! DIXXX!!!*** OK, now back to my original post...I REALLY enjoyed seeing The Mummy! First off, I am a huge fan of the original Universal films (my favorite is The Wolfman) and of good Horror/Thriller films, in general. I have also read Frankenstein and Dracula as well as some of the Anne Rice novels (such as The Mummy and Servant of The Bones) and numerous Ghost story compilations. I am also a big fan of Tom Cruise films. The guy is a force of nature! His films are always incredibly entertaining and this one is no exception. It is a wild ride! There is a lot going on in this film, a lot to see, because Universal Studios is launching their Dark Universe series with this. I love the EPIC sweep of this film. I loved the different locations and mystery they introduced (granted, they weren't able to lay down a ton of any one element, except for the end of the film. This wasn't a 3-hour Peter Jackson Epic, ala Lord of the Rings, or anything like that, but they laid the groundwork well all the same). But that's the thing. I think because they are trying to create the Universe ""of Gods and Monsters"", things can seem over-the-top or ""too"" fantastic, I suppose. Also, the fact that the film takes place in modern day might turn off ""the purists"" out there. But, if you are a fan of the DC Comics/Marvel Comics Universe films, then you should like what they are doing here because this is the ""Gods and Monsters""/Universal Studios version of that. I think it's immensely fertile ground to develop and I am really excited to see what will come next! Is it perfect? No. There are some CGI ""gimmicks"" that we've seen before and the some of the ""Un-Dead"" elements aren't really there to horrify as much as to be creepy/fun. So, sure there's room to critique. But this isn't intended to be a ""serious"" Horror film but more of an adventure film with Monsters. It has much to offer the movie-goer who is looking for some pure escapism, action, along with some cool Horror-elements and interesting story-development. It's a cool idea, presented in an epic way. It's all for fun and thrills! I highly recommend it!",The Mummy
755,georgikolarov,Souless movie,5,13 June 2017,"SpoilersThe movie is unable to catch the unique feeling of the 1999 Mummy and they tried it painfully obvious. Its neither funny or scary.Tom Cruise is a phenomenal actor but in this case his big star name doesn't help the character to be more believable. In the first minutes they describe him as treasure hunter whom puts gold above friendship, love, self care and later he suddenly becomes trustworthy, fights for the girl and saves the world. Again, similar with O'Connor from 1999 but far from desired effect because for someone like Tom Cruise is almost impossible to escape the public perception from his previous roles. Apart from the acting, Adam Sandler presence in this movie would have been similar IMO. The girl is nothing more than a beautiful blonde to please the eyes. The second part of the movie which included the ""Monster Fighting club"" it is ... stupid, I don't know why but it felt unreal for some reason. Russel Crowe is a miss cast, I mean for his role they could have used anybody and pay him far less money. The ending is dumb and expected. I read that they plan to make a Monster Universe starting with this movie but if this is true, they made a terrible job with the foundation of that Universe. This is probably the worst big office movie of Tom since he had become a star. His name may be the reason that this title would make a decent amount of money but if there is sequel .. the flop is almost certain",The Mummy

Most of the scenes was over done with cgi,to me it seem like 3 different movie scripts jammied all together, the undead mummies that Ahmanet brought back look more like zombies from resident evil,the 1999 version of the mummies that imhotep had were more scary, if they do decide to make a movie mummy again, at least have a proper back story for the monster, just as they were getting into the story of Ahmanet they cut away. Why the 1999 version worked was because they kept it in around Egypt with imhotep story being told threw out the first 2 movies, threw in a few laughs but also taught you a bit of history of the ancient Egypt, even if most of the 1999 was made up, it made it sound like it really happened, which i think what most people are looking for in this movie. any movie that set in Egyptian mummy universe should stay in early Egypt instead of bringing it into present time where it will not work as this disater has been.i would save your money and wait until it on vod, they were a lot of bad reviews from critics about movies that turn out to be better that what they thought about it but i think there right about this",The Mummy

Tom cruise as usual is really good, and the others like sofia boutella and annabelle wallis. Crowe did a good job to in this movie. The version of Mr.Hyde on this movie is quite right at the point.

Sure i felt that the villain was underdeveloped and the female lead was more of a damsel than an actual character and just made me miss Evelyn and her very intellectual and brave character from the 90's Mummy Movies.I am a huge fan of the original monster movies mainly the back and white and silent films, this film takes be back to the days when the villains and stories were good and not now when monster movies (which can't really be called that anymore) revolve around cursed dolls, board games, psycho killers in masks and above all dumb kids messing in things that they shouldn't.Thy original monster movies where a huge part of my childhood and even more so to my family, who would always watch them with me. Now today my dad and i make a tradition of watching them together and admiring them for so much that they gave. this movie made me excited to see where the ""Dark Universe"" will be going in the future (although i really think that they should have renamed the franchise)With titles like the Wolf Man, Creature from the Back Lagoon and the invisible man coming soon who wouldn't be excited for this new franchise to hopefully fright and delight newcomers and fans who love and respect the horrors of old.",The Mummy
764,theoddportraitdesign,This is Really Bad honest review,2,22 June 2017,"Honest review here, just a normal guy, not a blogger, don't work for the industry, and had to share.I love these types of movies, just always have. I honestly wish I could have the time of my life back from watching this movie. My mind cannot even begin to try and put together the thoughts and confusion I have on all of this. There is a great wave of stress going through me as I try and compose my thoughts here.There is so much I was to say but trying to formulate here the absolute disconnect and boredom that was provoked it hard to get together. The movie just jumps around from scene to scene with no real flow. It is full of been there done that clichés, uninspired storytelling and writing, and very bad acting.Tom Cruises sidekick for the first half of the movie just tries way to hard. It is one of those put your hand over your eyes and hide from embarrassment moments every time he speaks or is on screen.It just goes from serious scene, cut and straight to action scene, cut and to comedy scene, then repeat. The problem here is the action scenes just start to try and get you going then move along to the next comedy segment. Which never even comes across as being funny. It's cringe worthy. I found a better time walking to the bathroom talking to a random stranger than I did sitting down in this movie. Halfway through all of this weird stuff starts happening, and it just does not tie together. If you were to put anyone other than Tom Cruise in this roll and it makes sharknado look like an Oscar winner.Then the mummy oddly rides Tom Cruise, tickles him, then speaks of the day of the dead. You did not know if they were going to get it on, kill each other, or cue next unfunny sequence. Yeah I hated on this movie, and rightfully so. I was not even going to post this until I saw all of the fake 9 and 10 star reviews praising this as if it re-defined the genre. And as if some huge monster movie is going to emerge in the so in the trend now huge movie universe of all things we group together. Did I mention has horrible the acting really is ? Other than Tom Cruise , I felt the entire supporting staff was out shined by a 1992 episode of Different Colors or 227Just to add, at no point in time was anything ever scary. Not even remotely. You never feared for Cruises safety, or the well-being of anyone. You would find it hard to even care.

I for one am very interested in seeing where it goes in the next installment. Horrors do not generally fair well. But let's stop beating this one up as unoriginal by comparing it to other mummy movies of the past. This one has added a new story line that I found interesting. It has a brilliant cast! I for one laughed quite a bit and so did at least 90% of the audience! On the Web I have read nothing but negative reviews for the most part and a lot of rather odd comparisons.

Character building feels thin and lack of depth. Especially those ""supposed to be funny"" moment really should not been there at all， these laughingstock were placed there out of blue which makes people who watching the movie feel awkward. Nothing like the originals where laughter come nature to the audience, or maybe we just used to these old tricks. Negatives aside, let's talk about the large scale battle clashes, oh wait, there is no large scale battle clashes unlike the originals.

779,screenmunch,The Mummy is a complete car crash,1,7 July 2017,"So Universal want to rival Disney and Marvel by creating a Dark Universe – a new world reboot of all the classic monster movies such as Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolfman. Good for them, it's a brilliant idea. However, they have shot themselves in the foot with this first attempt, The Mummy.I usually like to start with the good in a review, but it is difficult to find anything good about this film. I will give the filmmakers something – the use of practical effects in the movie was great to see and I hope more films realise how much better it can make action scenes look on the big screen. Sadly, this did make the film's poor CGI stand out like a sore thumb – in particular The Mummy's undead sidekicks looked like something out of a 90's video game.Tom Cruise plays the same role in this film as he does in every other film he's in. I'm not a Cruise fan at the best of times; I would like to say he was miscast and should not have been put in the role; having said that, I have no idea who should be in the role as it was such a poorly written character in the first place. The screenplay team (David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman) are not a bad set of writers; but I do sometimes think that the more writers you have, the worse the script can be. Everyone was clearly throwing ideas all over the place and then trying to tie them together in to some kind of story and it didn't work. It's almost like they were so focused on trying to begin this Dark Universe that they completely neglected the story of The Mummy. In fact, half way through the film, Russel's Crowe's dreadful attempt at playing Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde becomes the focus point of the story!The Mummy is one of those stories that could have strong female leads. Kurtzman's version fails at this miserably. Annabelle Wallis' presence in the film is virtually non-existent and the writing made everything she did very hollow. Rachel Wise as Evie in the 1999 film was a much stronger and well-rounded character. Then we have Sofia Boutella as the Mummy girl herself, a tough independent woman, who spends the majority of the film chasing her lover (sorry...Chosen One!) Nick (Cruise) across London (yes that's right London, not Egypt!) until she can finally lock lips with him.The Brandon Fraser version in the 90s was not perfect, but it got so much right – the action, the adventure, the humour, the story, the characters. This 2017 reboot has trashed all of that in one very dull swing. Throughout the film, all I could think to myself is ""what the hell is going on!?"" and that is never good.LAST MUNCH: The Mummy is a terrible start to the Dark Universe series, a huge disappointment for 2017's film output and one of the worst big-budget movies ever. I just hope Universal learn from this mistake and try to take this monster world in a whole new direction, or I fear another car crash may come our way.",The Mummy
780,glsun,"The worst Mummy film I have seen, it has ruined the whole theme for me",1,31 July 2017,"I am quite disappointed with this movie, the mummy series brought out a feeling of adventure and joy for me. That was ruined in this movie, not only with casting Tom Cruise but, the layout of the story line. Why on earth would one cast an actor, that has solely based his career on action packed drama and shooting at every turn. Into a role that has been portrayed as humorous, playful and saving the day role. A film that was based around a family, that was brought up on the archaeological curiosity for the Egyptian treasures. He brings out all the wrong elements, taking away the attention from the true sense of it. The Dr. Henry Jekyll is a nice touch but, it was lost in casting the wrong person. It would have been better to have introduced him, in a manner that would have given the monster themes better credit. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, made better sense of the monster theme then in this film. It is a nice connection, and I would like to see it played out better in sequels but, not with Tom Cruise.The way that the archaeological knowledge (that you see in the previous movies), was played out in this film was so bad and frustrating.

I really don't care what his personal life is or what religion he follows, I pay to be entertained. I thought this new installment was cool. I never liked the original ones with that other guy. He was a terrible actor and his credits were movies with Pauly Shore! I also like Sofia as a bad guy like in the Kingsman. I like where they are going with this dark universe and it beats the old cheesy ones back in the day. The special effects were good and Tom was not cheesy. The story was good and the acting wasn't too bad for an action flick. I almost didn't rent it because of these so called critics who seem to think they speak for all of us. Is it an Oscar nod? No but who goes to these movies expecting great acting and character development. It is what it is: action and fun to take you away for a few hours.

This is a B grade movie with a blockbuster budget and If you subtracted The Mummy this was basically just another Mission Impossible movie with zombies. There was so much potential for this film but there was just too much wrong with it, from the lack of authenticity the unnecessary link with the crusaders, the change of location and Dr Jekyll had more screen time then the Mummy.***Spoiler***The crusaders just did not fit in and neither did the zombies.Why on earth would you move The Mummy story away from Egypt?? and put it in Iraq and London??????Why would you also have The Mummy Ahmanet shackled for 2/3 of the film??Why was The Mummy basically always looking sad with puppy dog eyes, THAT IS NOT SCARY!!! just SAD! You could have made her some evil temptress with daddy issues at least. Not some poor pathetic excuse of an unwanted little child.-Why did you focus more on Dr Jackal then Ahmanet? This was not a Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde film. ***Spoiler***What Universal should have done was kept it strictly between Egypt and London. Spent more time developing the character Ahmanet since the movie is about her and drawn more of a link between the old Egyptian gods and the modern era.Dr Jackal should have been more of a minor character.

Directors are trying to create ""Atmosphere"" by lowering the brightness and increasing the contrast, but in the end that just gives us incredibly dark movies that are annoying to watch. I wish the director would take another, objective look at his movie. Half the time you can barely see what's going on. Jokes are lost in the darkness. Facial expressions are practically invisible.

It had underwhelming trailers and sparse marketing but man was I wrong in judging this movie beforehand. The Dark Universe introduces us to their unique element that differs from its superhero rivals. Horror.What I like about this film is that it never really bored me. Pacing was was well done and a lot of stuff may happen at once. There were some few monologues here and there but it does not distract the experience. Cinematography was good, as a guy who loves astounding camera-work there were some shots that made the villain (Sofia Boutella) look so beautiful. The tricky part is the acting, Tom Cruise was good at some scenes especially intense moments but felt he could do more in his role. Supporting characters were good but no noteworthy performances (sorry Russell Crowe).

792,paula-read,Don't believe the bad reviews,7,18 June 2017,"This is an enjoyable summer action film, Tom Cruise isn't as bad as the reviews say, the mummy has a larger role than most reviewers say - It seems like a lot of people have gone in with a set of expectations about what this film would be in terms of the DC universe, or story line, or as a reboot. Going in with no expectations except for those of the terrible reviews, we were all pleasantly surprised. Our first comment to one another when the lights went up was, ""Why all the bad reviews, that was a fun ride?"" There are so many movies that are worse, and get better reviews, because they don't have TC in them. But then, Oblivion got terrible reviews, Edge of Tomorrow did poorly when they were released - and in retrospect, those movies hold up just fine and have found their audiences. Don't forget that Bladerunner got terrible reviews when it first came out (not that I'm comparing The Mummy to Bladerunner, just saying critics don't always get it right.)Hey, I think Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher was an awful idea, too, but that doesn't mean he can't have a good niche as the unlikeable hero who is going to get redeemed somehow, whether he likes it or not. People think Tom Cruise has worn out his welcome, they don't' like his religion, whatever - I get it. He still makes reliable action films and isn't afraid to play a guy who is a very reluctant hero, if he's even a hero at all. I, for one, would watch the next installment of The Mummy.",The Mummy

I on the other hand choose to watch the work and rate it on its merit.

Russell of Jekyll was neat though, incorporating two classics in one movie was cool. The movie needed to more story to it and clearly its meant to have a sequel but that's not going to happen any time soon or at all and since this movie tanked, we won't get the rest of the Dark Universe adaptions either which is a shame, I read Johnny Depp was set to play Invisible Man possibly.

This Movie has a good story and excellent action sequence and huge sets, ya I know few gimmicks are there but what do you want from the movie every movie have some flaws but it doesn't mean that you're going to make it worst movie of the year.

One of the worst films of the 21st century, so-called The mummy keeps you on permanent snooze and the characters are incredibly plastic and given no backstory.

I've seen bad movies and to count this in the ranks of one of them is bullshit. I'm not saying that I would count this as the greatest movie I've ever seen but it's not unbearable to watch like most of These critics are saying. I had a great time watching this movie and it was very entertaining. The acting and story was very good and I even had some laughs in while watching. I thought the ending was amazing but I'm not going to spoil anything, you just have to see the movie for yourself. I know this movie did not do well enough to make a monster universe or sequel movie and I think that's a shame because I genuinely did enjoy this movie and would have Loved to see what comes next.

802,SebGlassar,Enjoyable movie - ignore the hate,7,17 June 2019,"It's at the high end of what the scope of your expectations should be going into a movie like this. Crowe, Cruise, Wallis, Johnson and Boutella are all a joy to watch. They succeeded with what they were going for with this film, I suspect - it's fun and well made. I don't understand why people ar so harsh towards it in their reviews. I mean, what were they expecting? An exact remake of the 1999 version? A lesson in Egyptian Mythology? What? Why the hate?There are many ways to fail miserably when making any movie. If you get lazy and just go through the motions you end up with something everyone could do without. We've all seen plenty of those. Without waxing lyrical about it, The Mummy really shouldn't be cast in the same pile with the garbage typical to this genre. It has a good balance of trying it's best withouth taking itself too seriously.If you have any wits about you, and you click on something called 'The Mummy' on Netflix, your expectations should be met just fine.",The Mummy

If you name a movie ""Mummy"" you must stand the comparison to existing movies with that title. And the old ones are better in any category i can imagine.

It is not meant to be campy, but it still light hearted.I like the stories arch, and how it was told. Though Sofia Boutella, Ahmanet, was actually quite good in her role.

When I first saw the trailer, I thought that Tom Cruise would take The Mummy series to the next level, but I was wrong. Tom Cruise, who is one of the best actors in the world, is wasted in such a badly designed scenario. I wish they chose an unknown actor so they could find a chance to prove theirselves in a mediocre movie.In a nutshell, if you like to see this movie, go see it but don't set your expectations too high.

Some fun elements inserted just hung up in the air. Feels like Indiana Jones mashed up with Uncharted in the least good way possible.

Brendan's funny acting/face simply doesn't fit a movie talking about life and death. The original story is good, but they put a ""comedy"" actor to run a show that is supposed to be serious. This ""comedy"" effect is amplified in Mummy 3 Tomb of Dragon Emperor, and it killed this series of movie completely.Comparing to Brendan, Tom is better, if not too ""serious"" (image from Mission Impossible?). There is a twist in the middle of the story, making its ending completely different from the original. I like it.

Aside from this, the script was horrendous. It was extremely stiff and unnatural. You can tell when someone's acting is good, but the problem lies with the script. This is pretty much what happened in this movie.The script is so awkward and unnatural that it overshadowed the actors' performances.Although I already had my doubts after seeing the trailer, I saw the 7 star rating on IMDb and decided to give it a shot. ""Maybe it won't be that bad,"" I thought. ""Maybe it's just that the trailer wasn't put together well.""I thought wrong.Another problem I had with the script was that it was clear that the scriptwriter(s) wanted to make one-liners that would become household phrases (e.g. ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" - The Dark Knight). Unfortunately, not only did this endeavor fail, but it failed badly.If you're looking for an action movie involving mummies, I would suggest you watch ""The Mummy (1999)"" and ""The Mummy Returns (2001)"".

It's a return to the film from the 1930's with Boris Karloff.This film is not set in Egypt. The director wants us to experience what it would be like if a monster invaded our modern world. So he chooses to set the story in modern places like London museum.The scene where the mummy turn the glass into sand was cool. I bought the blu-ray/DVD combo and intend to view it again.Don't listen to the other reviewers see it and make up your own opinion. Just expect a horror movie not a Brandon Freser comedy remake.

However, having said that despite how bad it was, I kept wanting to watch more mainly to see how bad it would get and it certainly delivered as the film got worst including the cheesy ending designed clearly to entice us into the dark universe which will be Universals attempt to follow Disney's method of success with the money making machine that is Marvel.",The Mummy

The first title of the Dark universe is in a league of it's own, it's not a family friendly version of Karloff's movie, it's just called the same.Spoilers ahead.Being a fan of monsters and horror, I went in with low expectations, and it blew me away, seriously, we're talking about Universal going back to the basics here, but in a spectacular fashion, the classic monsters are back, and they're now referenced and studied by Prodigyum.Russell Crowe's portrayal of Jekyll is the best put to film in at least thirty or forty years, they actually used lines from the book, he totally steals the movie from Cruise. Cruise delivers well as his usual action hero self, but what really is the backbone of the story, is Ahmanet's story, it has sordid moments, it's mythology is well researched, and you can even emphatise with the character, there's a god of death present,and he's referenced and shown throughout the movie.If you love horror and creepy crawling things in the dark, this is the movie for you, please don't listen to the haters and give this a chance, they've got a lot to show us!",The Mummy

Upon viewing the film though I was very pleased.The Mummy is a fun intense ride that does not rely on fake science which is a relief (Ant-Man and Iron Man's suits come to mind). The Mummy builds upon the myth and the explanation of the Mummy's existence as a god taking a human host was a better back story then a curse. The introduction of the Jekyll/Hyde character was also welcoming and stayed true to the books transformation.Overall the films pace was great and didn't feel too rushed. The only problem I had with the film was the scene in which the Mummy controlled the sandstorm in the city for basically no reason at all. For today's movies it seems harder to make a film scary since violence is the norm in the media and the plot progressed too quick for a change in pace.At this point, the movie is rated 5.5 on IMDB.

I have to admit that I went in skeptical; I had read some unfavorable feedback. I thought I would give this movie a chance; after all the 1999 film with the same title was very good. First let me address the story. What were the writers thinking? Where they up late one night smoking some crack while watching some really good movies and got inspired to write a freaky hybrid of all of those movies? Let me paint you a picture. Let's take The Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and a side of An American Werewolf in London throw them in a blender. Drink the concoction and vomit it out, and you have this movie. Second let me address the casting.A. What in the world were these actors thinking?B. I hope they got paid up front.C. Who did they owe a favor to or were they being blackmailed? I still can't wrap my mind around why so many A list actors were in this... I can't even call it a film with a straight face.Third let me address the producers. What made you think that this was worthy of your money? Was it because it had an already established name? Was it because it was marketed as the next great summer blockbuster? Were you smoking crack with the writers? Do you just have that much money that you don't know what to do with it? Are you laundering money for the mob or a prostitution ring? As an independent filmmaker myself, please allow me to put your money to good use in the future. That is if you would like to fund actual creativity and art.If you are looking for a good movie skip this one. Might I recommend that you keep an eye out for The Atoning. A great indie film that will soon have distribution in digital media and DVD/Blu-ray. It still amazes me that movies like The Atoning get passed up for theatrical release and garbage like this gets big bucks from the studios.

852,jeddicott,Awful with a capital A,1,11 June 2017,"First off let me point out that I am a big Tom Cruise fan and a massive fan of the Brendan Fraser original but this is probably the worst Tom Cruise film I have ever seen. Having already seen the reviews I wasn't hoping for too much but what I witnessed what an absolute let down of the highest order. Towards the end I was actually looking at the time on my phone to see how much longer I would have to endure this. Acting, plot, storyline, CGI and script were all poor except for Tom's acting as he always tries to give his best but his sidekick Annabelle Wallis couldn't be any more wooden, she is really bad in this movie, no charisma or personality and you don't care if she lives or dies. Russell Crow is awful and I am surprised he even bothered once he had seen the script. The scene where the mummy's zombie helpers are attacking the ambulance had no menace about it and I've seen it done so much better in the Walking Dead series. I cannot believe that Universal think that this stinker is going to impress anyone waiting for the Dark Universe series of movies to arrive. I want my money back.",The Mummy

The underlying plot about cruaders, ancient Egypt and another US war in the Middle East would have a potential for a great story but with the lore this thin, dialogue straight of the meeting table whiteboard and historical references this vague, it completely failed to catch my attention and I had to watch it in three parts.The Mummy herself was great, everyone else felt just misplaced.

It's hokey without having classic charm.There is this thing about Dr Jekyll that is beyond hilarious, but not to the film's benefit.The unintentional hilarity of this film is it's greatest aspect. But will anyone say this was a great movie?? Not if they've ever seen the Brandon Fraser films. Brandon was funny, even with bad lines. Tom can't pull it off, it's just too bad and he's too..

Plus some forced romance is going on.",5,4 August 2017,"It started of fine, I like an Egyptian mythology movie just like everyone else. But this movie was cringe worthy on a unhealthy frequent bases, and here's why.1: In the begging I could see past the cliché that were building up, until it the cliché pile started to over flow. It became so stupidly common that the ending was predictable. 2: I liked the fact that our protagonist Nick was in a sort of trance because of the mummy. But that last point fell away quickly as the movie managed to use that infrequently, to the point it was excused because of plot reasons. 3: Another headache sparking reason, was the fact that our weird doctor Henry was possessed by something so mysterious, the movie didn't even care to explain what the hell was going on with him. He just freaked out at obvious moments to give him a weird vibe, and then left with nothing of a reason4: The love story that was set up from the first ten minutes of the movie was predictable. Now the fact that, our blond haired, blue eyed, hot female was obviously going to fall in love with Nick despite that she seemed to hate him at first, wasn't the only reason I hated the romance. It was that this 'falling in love' happened over the course of a very short week, probably a matter of 4 days. Making it for me an even more stupid and forced romance, than the romance in Thor and that happened over the course of a weekend!5: When we were building up to the final, it was clearly explained that our buddy Nick was going to be possessed by an ancient devil god, Set. And that Nick's body would be used as the mortal form for the god. But when Set all-mighty god was finally given the body, he just remained silent in the back corner of Nick's mind, not wreaking havoc over the world!! Like, why?? It was just cringe worthy and anticlimactic to see Set having so little effect, expect for bringing back death loved ones for Nick.6: My big desperate sighs were at its worst when I realized they were going set up the final for a sequel. Only to have our revived female lover searching for a cure to save him. Stupid. Cliché. Anticlimactic. And not worth to see in theaters.",The Mummy

Universal seem to have forgotten that the reason their original films were so beloved was that they were actually horror films as opposed to bland Tom Cruise vehicles. Instead of a sympathetic yet creepy antagonist this ""monster movie"", focuses on a somehow even worse version of Suicide Squad's Enchantress fighting a tired digitally de-aged Tom Cruise in a final act that shamelessly rips off the 80's dumpster fire Lifeforce but is strangely even worse. You can clearly tell that the script was stitched together by six different people desperate to appeal to a committee of idiots, that shouldn't be running one of the oldest and most influential studios to the ground, thanks to the ceaseless simple exposition, failed humor and disgusting pandering to a foreign market.

866,sohailahmadlovely,Marvelous,10,30 June 2017,"If #TheMummy is supposed to be the beginning of Universal's ambitious Dark Universe that showcases their classic monsters in one big shared cinematic crossover, then they're off to a terrible start.There's probably only a couple of sequences that somewhat thrill, the rest are just a continuous string of one poorly written, poorly acted and poorly executed scene after another. It feels more like sitting in a dentist's waiting room as opposed to rockin' on a roller coaster ride. And Tom Cruise is just wrong for this role, a huge case of miscast. Perhaps they should just press the reboot button again.Sofia Boutella plays an evil ancient princess imprisoned in a tomb deep beneath the unforgiving desert. When a couple of treasure hunters and an archaeologist awaken her in our present day, she returns to life to reclaim her destiny while at the same time unleashing unimaginable terrors in this new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters. Co-starring Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson, directed by Alex Kurtzman.The concept of what the writers and director Alex Kurtzman is trying to present to us with ""The Mummy"" is nothing new, in fact it's quite predictable, but the biggest problem about it is that along the way from point A to point B, they fill it in with moments that just don't work. And it gets even more frustrating when they bring it up again the second, third and fourth time as if shoving it down our throats would make it better. The jokes fall flat so much so you kinda feel sorry for Jake Johnson who clearly wants to make some effort as this film's comic relief. There are also parts that are just absolutely pointless and unnecessary. The characters including Dr. Jekyll frequently draw conclusions out of their butts. I do think ""The Mummy"" is what happens when the story is forced to serve the visual spectacle instead of the other way around. That said, rising star Sofia Boutella is a marvelous choice, she exudes that thirst for power effortlessly in addition to being incredibly seductive.",The Mummy

The latter featured Tom to be a more action packed hero. One may comment that MI and Mummy are typically two different genre and cannot compare apple to apple. However if compare to the previous three installments of Mummy, this 4th installment is the worst as humor portion is minimal, the final boss is weak and action is less adventurous. The movie felt more like a vampire movie in the sense that the boss sucked the life out of the victims. No wonder this movie has a very low overall users rating.",The Mummy

Sofia was amazing. She managed to be evil but still relatable. There were parts where I wanted Cruise to go through with her plan just to see what would happen because she put on such a convincing show.I really liked the atmosphere of the film: evil occult-like ancient egypt themes blended with victorian/lovecraftian horror make for some creepy vibes. The sarcophagus design was amazing.My biggest complaint would probably be the out of place comedic moments. Not that a thriller can't have them, but they can't be forced into the middle of otherwise tense/spooky scenes. It unravels all the tension that they've put so much work into creating.Definitely underrated as of this review.

Different from each other, imperfect but they worked as a team. And this is where its all starting to break apart. After surviving an assault, they end up discovering the tomb of the mummy.Now I get that people want some love story, no matter how shitty it is. That at least explains, why they decided to add some one-night- stand-archaeologist, which seems to know some basics about old- Egypt, into the story. But it doesn't explain why the working duo got replaced by that.So instead of watching an interesting diverse team, trying to kill an ancient god, couse I don't see why you would even consider the archenemy a mummy. You get some random soon-to-become-couple dealing with problems that have little to no similarities to the movie title.It's like the movie could have ended in 20 min, so they decided to add: {Spoileralert}a mental illnessa legendary weaponsome knights from a few hundred years agosome stupidly equal Dr. Jekyl and Mr. HydeZombiesand so onI didn't expect it to be realistic, but neither did I expect the physical strength of characters to change every 2 seconds.

It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story.

The Mummy was exciting, well made, fun and action pact!",8,9 June 2017,"What could have happened to get such a fast angry mob of movie critics and bloggers to so quickly trash The Mummy days before it came out? Well, I saw it and for the life of me could not find much to complain about.I understand that a persons opinion of a movie is just that, an opinion. Yet a couple of days ago sitting at my desk I start seeing a flood of negative reviews about The Mummy. So I read, and I read, and I continued to read words such as horrible, terrible, worst Tom Cruise movie ever, etc etc. So I decided to go to the movies today and just see this apparent train wreck of a movie. I sat there and was willing to accept what ever apparent ""garbage"" they threw at me. I mean I managed to stay through the entire Suicide Squad and I have to admit that was a mess, horrible in my opinion because they tried to cram way too many leading rolls down my throat.So after watching The Mummy do I agree with the premature flood of angry reviews? Reviews I was almost forced to endure on my many devices as if a global event was happening. I was told The Mummy was not good, not good at all in many words. Well the truth is the critics lie and apparently bullying a movie out of the box office is a live and well. I was actually quite happy with The Mummy. I liked Nicks character played by Tom Cruises who I felt was believable for a fun summer action movie. I enjoyed Jenny, co-star Annabelle Wallis who fit the roll well and did not annoy me like some actors can when it comes to 'running and screaming'. I sat through the entire movie and at one point I actually was looking for something to complain about. I personally did not like Russle Crow as Jekyll because I felt, in all honesty he was too fat for the roll. Sofia Boutella did a great job as the main villain. I could feel her feel her rage and madness and at one moment she made me jump.

889,akashsond,It's probably not the worst movie you'll see this year but it's not good.,5,10 June 2017,"The Mummy was said to be a remake of the original(s) and a remake of the remakes. Basically a modern retelling of the same story with updated dialogue, effects and stunts. It was advertised as a kind of action/horror starring Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella and Annabelle Wallis. In short, it's an action movie with big(ish) sets, fast action and decent CGI but it falls short with its over simple plot, bad dialogue and Cruise's performance. In other words, another standard Tom Cruise movie.The plot is straightforward almost to the point where it lacks twists and consistent excitement. Cruise's performance was hard to believe at times and bordered the realm of 'cringeworthy'. Wallis' performance was decent strengthening the movie overall but personally I think its Boutella's performance as Ahmanet that brings my rating up. She was believable and possibly frightening but at times also showed the vulnerability that was key to the plot. Jake Johnson has a similar role to that he had in Jurassic World, be a relatable character, deliver some funny lines and keep the audience engaged. This worked at times, especially early on, but becomes somewhat out of place as the movie progresses and some of the lines don't hit home as the filmmakers probably hoped. **Spoilers Ahead. Skip to next Paragraph to avoid**. Russel Crowe appears in this film as Dr. Henry Jekyll which on face value is an obvious nod to the classic strange case of 'Dr. Jekyll and MR. Hyde'. This turns out to be more than a nod as his character does indeed display both human doctor and monster. This is possibly to set up further movies in this shared 'Dark Universe'. However, after watching the film, I don't think this is as strong of a start the studio was looking for. There is a scene early on where the plane carrying the main characters crashes. This scene was actually filmed in a zero gravity aircraft and the stunts were real. This is incredible and it really shows on screen. It's a breath of fresh air from a CGI dominated box office. Overall, a good 'villain' performance, decent supporting cast and well executed stunts make for a good film experience however Cruise's performance, an over simple plot and comedic lines that didn't always land made for an average movie on par with Tom Cruise's other latest movies. Probably not worth a cinema watch but worth a home watch on DVD. 5/10.",The Mummy

So many repeat scenes and just overall bad acting from every single cast member. I agree with another persons rating that if this had been a zombie movie I maybe would consider 2 stars. The story line was very dry and there were so many jump cuts in the film. The worst being when Tom and Anna were sitting in the ""secret lab"" romanticizing. The movie production must have been rushed because over 90% of this film uses itself as more content.

It felt like telling the origin of a superhero. Every time destroying the suspenseful and tense atmosphere with humor out of place. Didn't feel natural like the original films. Extremely predictable and cliché. Tom Cruise representing the same character in every movie he has ever made. The conflict that affected the entire humanity was summed up in only two people. The only thing good about it is that the main villain had some history and we could sympathize even just a little. And the worst part: destroyed the Egyptian essence that a movie about a MUMMY should have. C'mon, you cannot make a movie about this and just mention some names from their mythology.

892,j_z-93239,A rough start for a universe with unexploited talents (SPOILERS),9,11 June 2017,"Everyone is excited about the start of the monster cinematic universe. Dark Universe is entering the ring with Paramount Pictures/Marvel Studios and Warner/DC. The movie does cover basic character plot and is fast-paced, there is little bonding between the general public and star characters, it may leave a few a bit skeptical/curious upon the origin of the organization which protects the world or how many other threats had there been. For someone new to the classic novel Monster, the Easter eggs around the movie may have needed a bit of more exposition time. The conflict was barely external. We don't really see much of our current culture being assimilated into the movie, no people other than the protagonists can see and are affected by the supernatural, it could have been more tangible if we had seen your good-old social media and #hashtags from people witnessing all these phenomena and later a huge cover-up as if everything had been coincidences and alternate factors. Perhaps it was a good trait too for the studios to leave that out. The end does make sense after pondering the idea of the self- sacrifice first presented by Dr. Jekill, it also offers room for viewers to think of the idea of Nick's destiny or if he will appear again, citing future threats and monster solo movies.

The only thing which is worth thinking about after you have seen the film is how the hell does Tom Cruise look so good at his age !! The story line is plain and simple. There are no WOW moments as in the previous films.Overall you can watch it for the sake of it. I think for a movie with such a name and history , it should definitely be similar to the last ones.Bring back Brendan Fraser and his team !!",The Mummy

896,terrymeare,The Mummy - Bad start to the Dark Universe?,5,12 June 2017,"The Mummy is directed by Alex Kurtzman, the same guy that wrote the script for the Amazing Spiderman 2. The funny thing is, both of these movies were made to create their own universe. We all know how the spidey universe turned out and to be honest, this isn't much better. Tom Cruise plays an ex soldier named Nick Mortan. Tom cruise is an awesome actor and sells every role. He does his own stunts and is very likable in his movies. I liked his character but he's kind of a dick. He's just out for himself but as usual Tom cruise sells his character. Then we have Anabelle Wallis as Jenny. An archaeologist, who basically tells Tom Cruise where he needs to go. Her character is literally a damsel in distress. I thought we were pass this, but apparently not. Probably not the best timing considering Wonder Woman came out the Friday before but she's fine. They have a romance that seemingly comes out of nowhere. Every movie these days needs a love story apparently. John Wick was so awesome because there were no love story, just ass kicking action. Russell Crowe stole the show with the scenes he was in. I won't say who he plays in case you don't know, as I didn't going in. Jake Johnson plays a Sargent and good friend to Cruise and is meant to be in it for the comedy. In all honesty, he wasn't funny, he was just annoying. The audience reacted to the comedy twice the entire time. Not great. Sofia Boutella was awesome as the actual mummy, and scarily attractive. She might be a little overpowered and I found myself thinking they would never escape certain situations they were in, but overall I did enjoy her version.Please don't go into this movie looking for a good story, you won't find it. The film is a typical action movie with no real point to it. The real issue with this film is it's not sure what it wants to be. It's an action film, a horror, then a comedy, all while trying to set up the Dark Universe. The set up feels forced. Instead of trying to make a good mummy film, they were more interested in letting us know there will be future films. We just want a good mummy movie. I was looking forward to this film too and it was a big letdown. The cool thing about Brenden Frasers mummy was it never took itself too serious. It was a adventure comedy at heart with horror and supernatural elements interwoven and it worked well. I think they should have made it more horror orientated. A horror universe with monsters would be cool as hell.This is a rocky start for the so called dark universe. I think they need to figure out what kind of world they want to create. The Mummy is a 3 out of five. The visuals are awesome and Tom cruise is good as always. The story is nothing exciting and a little underwhelming.If you've seen the movie, what did you think?If you enjoyed this review, please subscribe to my youtube channel.

Unfortunately the cliche's kept coming with the static cookie cutter plot which did not leave you guessing what was going to happen to the characters.Additional characters appear to have been placed within the film just for spin offs but tbh paint drying would be more entertaining to watch.Not going to ruin the ending because the rest of the film did a better job than anyone could feasibly do.",The Mummy

I can't even put my finger on it now, I tried to sift through it. Was there too much action and not enough story? Was the adding of another story line in the character of Dr Jekyll, a bridge too far?The characters evoked no emotion in me at all. I am sorry to say, I have not recommended it to anyone. When it comes out on TV I will watch it again to see if the problem is me...to be fair.The combined hero genre is new to me, but I have enjoyed all those I have watched, but in this film I wasn't thrilled with the combination.

This movie was bad. It was written for idiots going from exposition to exposition explaining everything that is happening in the movie so slow people can keep up. The actors poorly chosen for their roles, especially with Tom Cruise. Now don't get me wrong Tom Cruise is a weird guy but he is a decent actor... for some roles; this, however, is not one of those roles.If anything hopefully this movie shows universal what not to do with the rest of their ""Dark Universe"" or what ever the hell they are calling it.

I personally don't care about his believes, as long as he continues to make great movies, ie; Oblivion, Edge of tomorrow, M:I - Rogue Nation. Lets face it, hes the last of a dying breed of Hollywood greats. Tom cruise always tries his hardest to entertain us, with exciting stunts and action. I think The Mummy delivered that and it was quite creepy in places and some very violent scenes.I agree some of the dialogue and comedy moments missed the mark, however I was glued to the screen for just short of 2 hours. Some of the plot was a bit confusing, but this is a movie where you just switch off and enjoy it for what it is. sometimes its nice to just switch off.I'm looking forward to the next instalment in the franchise.

Ahmanet is portrayed by Sofia Boutella. Together with other cast, the story became exciting to watch. Story line is good and Universal Pictures presented good visual effects. A good movie to watch and to expect trilogies as Universal Pictures tagged the film under the Dark Universe.Just have question with the story. Why do you need to build a statue to a prison that is supposed to hold Ahmanet. Where is Nick and the revived dead Chris Vail supposed to go with their horse ride.Why is the dagger of Ahmanet can be destroyed, which the ancient Egyptians did not bothered to destroy, thus end of story? Why didn't the ancient Egyptians bury the sarcophagus deep to the ground and destroying all records of the burial like Genghis Khan right.Source: http://angatmakabago.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-mummy-2017- movie-review.html",The Mummy

The supporting cast also does a very good job. Sofia Boutella is beautiful and acted as you would expect any 1,000 year old Egyptian mummy to act, after being cooped up for so long. Annabelle Wallis also played the Tom's, somewhat, jilted girlfriend, as you would expect any slightly used person to feel. The cameo part that Jake Johnson provided ..very.. subtle but none the less, semi-slapstick humor. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Russell Crowe. Russell is an actor and was paid to do a job, which, on screen,...was not given time for much character development (perhaps in a sequel). The action and graphics were superb and because we go to a Tom Cruise Mummy movie to see a Tom Cruise Mummy movie,... if you're a fan, then you don't want to miss this one on the big screen.

Besides its basically the Egyptian Wonder Woman oversees. Also while I do think that their should have been more scenes with amanet, and a longer climax battle it still fits perfectly together. Who knows maybe with all the merchandising success, people will start eventually asking for a sequel.

Not knowing particularly why they are doing it, but simply because they feel it is politically correct thing to do. We often wonder if they even see the same movie we do. Tom Cruise movies rarely disappoint. We're not really sure what people have against him. Social media tends to breed a lot of clones. I recently read a most laughable article on MSN that implied Tom Cruises career is over. The show is great. Russell Crowe does a great job as Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.

911,jackbeddows,"The movie is somewhat enjoyable but highly problematic, pulling viewers out of the world of the story with needless deviations into unsure territories of genre blending.",5,20 June 2017,"This movie is somewhat enjoyable but it doesn't seem to know what sort of film it really wants to be. It starts as a more 'believable' and standard horror/action film, and it is well produced and the main actresses, one heroine one villain, playing opposite Tom Cruise are both very good- the villain in particular is well done and creepy. The movie would have been bearable and even decent if it stayed on that track. Then it begins to deviate by borrowing more or less directly from the humorous elements from An American Werewolf in London (talking to the dead, who apparently have a good sense of humor about being damned), which seem slightly out of place in the story.... at first this seems slightly quirky and possibly a plus, something interesting a new twist..... But the genre blending doesn't stop there, as a new character is then introduced (played by Russel Crowe) who's very existence suddenly switches the film to something completely more kitschy/tongue in cheek, a la' League of Extraordinary Gentleman or some made for TV fantasy series like Once. This time the shift in story telling, while still somewhat enjoyable on some more childish level, is very problematic- undermining the whole premise of the film as believable horror, and suddenly it becomes very unclear what sort of film The Mummy really wants to be. While the movie could have kept the Werewolf in London elements and gotten away with it, the Russel Crowe character with his traditional fiction persona is decidedly too much, and the genre blending has crossed over to stupidity. Also the end is a bit Deus es Machina, where everything is suddenly groovy, and then the film totally devolves into an epilogue that is just embarrassing. I can't say I hate the experimentation, as at least it isn't the same standard formula, but at the same time, it would be foolish to not admit it simply doesn't work.",The Mummy
912,timothymkomiya,What a terrible movie and a lot of wasted potential,1,20 June 2017,"I've never written a movie review before, but after seeing this one I just had to, I was so disappointed. I was a kid when the previous Mummy series came out, and those movies were infinitely more interesting/entertaining. Its a huge disappointment because this film falls apart for several reasons:Story- Cursed Egyptian princess is awoken after 5,000 years. Okay, awesome. Has all the same powers as previous incarnation, Imhotep (controlling sands, super strength, animating corpses, etc.). Okay, cool- could've been a little more creative/ original, but okay. You cast Sofia Boutella as the new Mummy- super awesome (I'd never even heard of her before this movie and now I'll probably go see everything else she's ever in).And then the best the writers come up with is that the endgame for such a powerful entity would be... to just summon a more powerful entity than her into existence? Way to drop the ball- someone should be fired for that hack job. The potential was there to make Ahmanet an infinitely interesting character ( Sofia Boutella's seductive charm alone has you routing for Ahmanet half the movie) but they reduce her to an eye-candy role, writing her to literally need Tom Cruise's body to do what she has set out to do (not even going to delve into that ridiculousness). At least when they wrote Imhotep in the previous incarnation, it made sense in that his motivations were his own power, not someone else's.And that's without even touching on the rushed backstory for Ahmanet, or the fact that there is really no development in the relationships between the characters nor the characters themselves.Action- Its like they somehow took all the iconic scenes from the previous incarnation and made them awful. The Mummy absorbing people's life force. The images when the mummy is controlling the sands. The chase/escape scenes. Not only were none of these concepts elaborated on, they somehow managed to make them less interesting this time around, too. If you don't believe me, go back and watch the 1999 version.Cast- This is probably the most egregious problem with this movie, and its very disappointing because it wasn't all bad. Russel Crowe as Dr. Jekyll? Brilliant. Absolutely awesome portrayal of the Jekyll/Hyde characters delivered masterfully. Previously mentioned Sofia Boutella as the Mummy? What a perfect choice for the role. Even Jake Johnson's Sgt. Vail would've been good if the writing had been better. But 54 year old Tom Cruise as the lead? Embarrassing. Say what you will about Brendan Fraser, but in 1999 he had hit his stride and was funny and charming. He was also in his 30's and much more believable as a treasure-hunting action star. There's no point in even talking about the casting choice of Annabelle Wallis, because her presence might as well have been non-existent after the scene where she slaps Tom Cruise in the face (you know, right at the beginning). The writing didn't make it believable that she is an archaeologist, and the performance isn't memorable in the slightest. Especially if we're comparing that to 1999 Rachel Weisz's Evie who was a dream-babe.And even without the comparisons, if the two most interesting/compelling characters in your hero-saves-world action movie are A) a character who had all of 10-15 minutes of screen time, and B) the main antagonist, then you did something way wrong.All in all this was a sad attempt to reboot an awesome story which had great potential- a solid frame of reference in the previous incarnation, a darker, more dramatic/less goofy tone, and almost 2 decades in updates to CGI/special effects which could have made for much more compelling supernatural/action scenes- but it was squandered with terrible writing and awful casting which lead to hollow performances.",The Mummy

Now sure this movie wasn't perfect, but especially in comparison to all the movies that come out today it was pretty damn close. I think people just don't like Tom Cruise anymore. But he was Tom being Tom and he was great for this role. All of the acting was good and even Russell Crowe looked interested. Sure the movie was the new age feminist version where God forbid you have a man play the Mummy again. But it was still really good. It wasn't slow at all and I thought it was really beautifully shot. And it seemed like they understood that the Mummy is not a horror film so it isn't supposed to terrify you, but they also included several moments when I jumped out of my seat ( which is far more than I can say for almost all horror films).

920,willhigginson,"Great movie, Much better than many of the ""critics"" say",8,12 July 2017,"This film caught me by surprise and not because its ""bad"" but because its actually a fun and decent movie to watch. Yes that's right I am saying something positive about this movie. While it is on the cheesy side the original was just as bad but came across differently too its time and if you watch the original movies you will notice exactly what I am talking about.I found this movie to have a lot more depth than people give it credit for and the acting was actually brilliant. I also appreciate the depth and creativity that went into the prison scene and the fact they included mercury conduits as a part of the prisons mechanism especially due to the fact that mercury was used by the ancient Egyptians something a lot of people have yet to realise, for what exactly nobody really fully knows. As for the comedy/silliness it was actually not as blunt as I expected from a tom cruise movie and frankly I was quite entertained. I think too many people expect too much these day and have wild fantasies about what and how a movie should be instead of appreciating it for what it is. Some out of spite even want to hate a movie because its a ""remake"" or ""reboot"". I find this insulting to the cast and those who put a lot of hard work and time into this movie. I will say that I do think it could of gone a bit more in depth beyond the modern world and is delving into a type of film that expands beyond Egyptian mythology and while for the ""the mummy"" franchise I do not think this is a good thing which is why I've given the movie which is why I docked one point, I don't want it too stray too far from the franchise as it may end up becoming something else entirely. The second point was docked simply due to how cringey the movie can be sometimes, the humour was enjoyable but at times it felt like it was being funny when it should of been serious. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. As for the acting I found it perfect for the type of movie they were trying to create and I think they hit the mark. Tom cruise of course did a nude scene which was hilarious frankly I don't think anyone should be surprised he did that, he seems to like taking his pants off for whatever reason. Annabelle wallis was brilliant portrayed her character really well and Sofia boutella portrayed ahmanet brilliantly, I think Russel Crowe did a great job though I wasn't a fan of his character, I think overall that's down to the writing and not the actor. Overall, please don't assume that this movie is some how a serious hardcore drama movie with mythological entanglements, its fun its got action, great characters and a developing story which frankly I'm interested too see continue that uses Egyptian mythology and legends too create a interesting story that is worth a watch. Please give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is a decent good movie that can be re-watched and will likely be remembered as a great movie years later. Its definitely not a comedy but its definitely not a drama either. Its in between, the best kind.Everyone else giving it 4/10 5/10 etc. Seriously? lighten up for Christ sake.",The Mummy
921,welshmischief,Psiibly one of the worst of tom cruise and Russel crowe,2,14 July 2017,As an avid fan and watcher of both tom and Russel's movies.. i eagerly awaited the viewing of THE MUMMY. HOW Disappointed WAS I...?For a big budget movie the special effects were poor.. tom's acting tried to live up to its usual standard.. however the poor directing and script totally destroyed any credibility the his character.. as did it do the same with Russel crowe.I stuck with the movie until the last 20 mins or so..just from curiosity to see if there would be some dramatic ending.. however this was never in sight.. so gave up before reaching the end. I don't agree with some of the really negative comments about the movie on here however.. saying that it is down to the actors that fail the movie.. the watch ability is down to the lines and characters that are given to the actors by the makers of the film.. however Tom Cruise and Russel Crowe would have done well to steer well away from making this terrible movie.. surely they are not that hard up for cash.The storyline makes very little sense and fleets too quickly back and forth focusing on only the main characters .I would say forget this movie unless your really bored and have nothing better on TV to watch ..as this should have gone straight to TV not the cinema.,The Mummy
922,marcokero,Great movie,7,18 July 2017,"The Mummy (2017) Warning: spoilers. Director: Alex Kurtzman Date: 09/07/2017 Main Cast: Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Sofia Boutella, Jake Johnson, Russel Crowe. Plot summary: The film is about a soldier called Nick Morton and his friend Chris Vail who discovered a tomb of an old Egyptian princess called Ahmanet, who sold her soul to Seth (an Egyptian god). When they were flying back, Vail is possessed by Ahmanet and crashes the plane. Only Jenny and Nick survive. Ahmanet chases them and takes Jenny. Nick saves her by stabbing himself the dagger of Seth. He sucks the life of the mummy to save Jennny, who was dead. Jenny returns with her team and argue about Nick, because they don't know if he's good or bad, because he has Ahmanet soul inside him. Positives: It has a lot of action, the mummy is very well made (She needed more than 6 hours to put her make-up on) and the special effects make this movie entertaining. They made a very difficult scene with zero gravity on a plane. Negatives: They spent a lot of money and the film isn't that good. The dialog is very simple. Universal wanted to start a ""Dark Universe"" with this film and it could be a better start.Conclusion: We liked the film, we recommend it but it's not a top film that will be remembered.",The Mummy

Two of them might be that you want to watch the film for the sole reason of criticizing it, you are watching the film to point out the bad things in it, then yes, it is a very bad movie. The story is weak and predictable, with little to no character development. If you are watching this movie to get into the franchise it is going to start then you are going to have a bad time. But if you are not that person who constantly points out the bad things in people, then this is a good movie. You are going to have fun with the character of Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella.

If you are going to compare this movie to the original one, then yes, it is a very bad movie but the only reason the first one is good, is because of nostalgia.

932,benjaminthayer-59744,"Move along folks, nothing to see here.",2,18 September 2017,"What do you get when you combine a good actor like Tom Cruise, good movies like National Treasure, Indiana Jones, American Werewolf in London, Gladiator, and yes, even a moment of Alien thrown in? You get a very sub-par film called ""The Mummy"". It doesn't take a lot for a movie to keep me engaged. But I do expect a reasonable plot, some character development, and some basis in reality - even if it is science fiction. This movie was very fragmented and character development was very lacking. It was not very suspenseful and it had seriously lacking holes. Possible spoiler alert:For example - when Tom Cruise goes down in a nose-dive plane crash, he awakens in the morgue...supposedly alive because the Mummy's curse has protected him and kept him alive. That's fanciful. But to awaken ""whole"" when his body would have been burned and torn into a hundred pieces without a bruise - that's a little too fanciful. I saw what I believe were intentional elements of the movies I listed previously in this movie. The references were not amusing. It just made me think it was gimmicky. I don't mind seeing Tom Cruise in Sci-Fi thrillers. Edge of Tomorrow and Oblivion were good. But they were written well and had elements of surprise or humor. The Mummy? None of the above. My suggestion? Move on folks, there's nothing to see here.",The Mummy

Sofia Boutella does a better job then most of being the evil villain and is fun to watch. Tom Cruise is always good when he adds a bit of humor ,this is his best movie of the last 5 years.

935,ningengirai-67180,Boring and predictable.,3,27 October 2017,"-- CONTAINS SPOILERS! --This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it supposed to be humorous? If so, the humor falls flat, with dialogue I'd forgotten ten minutes after watching it, no charm, no wit, nothing remarkable. Is it supposed to be a horror movie? I can honestly say that at not one single point, I was even beginning to feel any kind of tension. Is there supposed to be a romance? If there was one, I barely noticed it start, let alone cared about it or its participants by the time it became of importance to the plot.The characters feel flat, uninspired and cliché. From Tom Cruise's 'egoistic thief with a cavalier attitude to other people's lives turned reluctant hero out to save his girl' ( like we haven't seen THAT before, and done much, much better ) to Annabelle Wallis' Jenny-with-a-heart-of-gold, the quite frankly jarring interludes of Jake Johnson's comic relief Chris Vail, to Russell Crowe's over-the- top Jekyll/Hyde, there was nothing that made these characters stand out. Don't even think about looking to the side characters. Did any of them even have names, other than Colonel Greenway? Did any of them have any kind of defining characteristic?Not even the titular character, The Mummy, stands out. We're given a very short voice-over introduction to Ahmanet, set in a very nebulous Egyptian time period, which fails to paint her as anything other than a power-hungry, seen-that-before scantily clad villain who made a pact with dark forces. Then she spends the rest of the movie trying to persuade her man Tom Cruise to her side, either by blunt force or seductive voice, so they can rule over the world after...what? Enslaving humanity? Turning everyone into zombies? Recreating Ahmanet's ancient Egypt? What exactly was the endgame here? The movie stays away from overused jump scares and many other tropes of the horror genre, but at the same time it fails at creating tension at all, psychological or visual. If you've watched any kind of zombie movie before, the zombies in The Mummy will at best make you yawn. I wasn't expecting a gore fest nor an abundance of other body horrors, but I was frankly astonished by the LACK of, well, monsters, given that this is supposed to be the kickstarter of a franchise focused on them. I'm not going to blame the actors. I neither greatly like nor dislike any of them. I'm not going to compare the movie to its predecessor starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, because although I've seen it, I wasn't a great fan of it back then. This movie suffers from a predictable plot, too-long action scenes, dated-looking CGI, way too little information about/screen time of the titular character Ahmanet/the Mummy, and a bland soundtrack. All in all, very disappointing.",The Mummy
936,amnamustafa,Hated almost every part of this Thing,1,14 November 2017,"The screen started black, setting the mood of this piece. Alright, I could get into that. Then words appeared. Me, being the stupid literate that I am, read it, because that's why I assumed the words were on the screen. Then the words faded away, and Russel Crowe narrated the exact same quote to the audience. I immediately wanted my money back.I don't know about anyone else who watches movies, but I like to follow the journey of a main character, whether they're completely likable or not, and see the experiences which change him/her. And I normally think that's the easiest part for a film to hit on. The Mummy somehow doesn't even do that. After a lot of nonsense, Tom Cruise is faced with a choice in a failing airplane. Does he save myself or does he save this woman he slept with? Wah-wah he chooses to save the female lead. Honestly, I had been fed up with the movie thirty seconds after it had started, but that moment made me shake my head at the level of ineptitude the movie was showing. The character was already where he needed to be. The rest of the hour and a half would be a waste of my time. There was no doubt in my mind that he would again be put in a situation where he would have to choose between himself and the female lead again. And there was no way he would choose himself, though that would have been interesting. And, surprise surprise, near the end of the movie, he chose the save the woman. There was no point to anything that happened in between, because I was watching a character who was completely static go around and do things. There was no growth, there were no life-changing realizations. He simply remained the same and tried to save the world or whatever. The plot was too complex and yet simultaneously unbelievably stupid.Another thing I absolutely detested about this movie is its name. It should have more appropriately been called The Zombie. Because though Sofia Boutella was my favorite part of this awful, awful creation, there was less of her than I would have liked, and more of her zombie minions. And I do mean zombies. She bit a live man and turned him into an un-dead minion who went around doing the same to other people. The zombies showed up far too often, and could be killed by smashing their heads in with rocks, and after the first three times they showed up they just became annoying. Normally I really like Russel Crowe. And for what this role was, I think he did a great job. That being said, I didn't listen to half of his lines because they were all monologues. His character seemed written in solely for the purpose of setting up the Dark Universe and explaining things in an unbelievably lazy way. Instead of slowly showing the audience what exactly was going on through good story- telling, the writers decided to just have Russel Crowe explain everything. And that was pretty infuriating. The female lead in this movie was incompetent, or just chose to not do anything useful. Again going back to the lazy writing, the first thing she did when she entered the screen was to slap Tom Cruise and yell out to the audience that he was such a jerk for taking her map after sleeping with her. And thus, it was introduced that the male lead was a jerk. Because if not for that line, I honestly would not have thought he was a jerk. A little reckless, yes, maybe a little mischievous. But not a jerk. Lazy, lazy, lazy. One of my least favorite parts of this movie was when Cruise and the female lead crashed a car because of the mummy. Cruise then proceeded to try and fight the mummy off with a big stick while the female lead stayed in the car and yelled at him to ""Get her, Nick! Get her! Kick her A--!"" The female lead had been introduced as an archaeologist or something who was supposed to be, I assumed, a spring of knowledge. Instead, she seemed just as confused, if not more confused, than Cruise most of the time, and seemed to show up at the exact wrong times, only to not do anything useful and instead be a hindrance, which quickly got on my nerves. The most likable character of this movie was the captain, who died less than fifteen minutes into the movie, and had less than seven lines total. The characters were all one-noted, inept, and unbearably clueless and needed to have Russel Crowe explain everything to them. The plot was boring and uninteresting because of all the boring dialogue the movie forced the audience to sit through, and the motivations were never really clear. But the worst part of this movie was how seriously it took itself. With the 1999 version, though it's no masterpiece film, at least it had heart, and the decency to realize that it was just a goofy summer movie meant for the audiences to enjoy. It knew what it was going to be from the get-go. The 2017 version, however, had no such understanding of self. It went from a classic Tom Cruise action movie to a sometimes comedy to a zombie/horror movie at a dizzying speed, and the conclusion left a lot to be desired. There are so many things wrong with this movie I could write a novel about it. Basically, I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless I hated them with all of my entire soul.",The Mummy

938,electrica-92244,"You can't polish it, but you can roll it in glitter!",4,10 November 2017,"The title of this review was my 11 year old son's handy synopsis review- I tentatively let him watch the film (a 15) as we both wanted to see it on the strength of the trailer, and we agreed to turn it off if it got too scary or adult for him. I needn't have worried, he laughed hysterically through an underwater chase scene as it was the 'slowest chase scene in history!'. He was laughing pretty much from the trailer onwards in fact. If this can't pass the scary or funny test with an 11 year old, it's not going to make it past an adult. What a terrible mish mash this film is! It has no idea if it's Indiana Jones, X Men or Mission Impossible, and fails to capture the magic of any of them. Ah...Mission Impossible... remember when The Cruiser used to turn everything he touched to gold? His character in this film is essentially like every character he's ever played - a charming narcissist with lots of teeth, but here, instead of completing us, or offering the boyish heart of Brendan Fraser, he lacks any humour or zing, and comes across as confused and dumb. It's difficult to understand how he signed to this project. The shallow charlatan character isn't really his doing though, it's the fault of the leaden dialogue. Truly terrible sixth form stuff that lacks any ambition or sparkle. The women are one dimensional, despite Sofia Boutella acting her socks off, and Jake Johnson, who put in a great supporting turn in Jurassic World, is reduced to an irrelevant comedy sidekick... without any laughs.The script fails at every turn. It's not funny, the action is oddly lacking in excitement, and it's utterly incoherent not just in plot, but also because it leaps about with no sense of progress or direction. I recall the Knight's Templar kneeling to the Egyptian Princess, under London in a crypt, just after Tom Cruise has run out of the Natural History Museum, appeared by Big Ben, fallen through a bus and had his dead friend appear and sidekick woman (she had like three lines, I have no idea what her name is) disappear, and thinking to myself 'I've missed something '. No, it's just a really shoddy script that's been edited until it lacks any internal structure whatsoever. The ending is truly baffling. Several story lines had no resolution, and Tom Cruise somehow becomes a monster... but we don't see him, and there's no sense of what the hell happens next. It's just left on a totally downbeat, open ended note. I think it was meant to be a note of suspense. I was really stunned at the crass 80s style racism, sexism, cultural superiority, cultural appropriation and sheer stupidity of this film too. And possibly the worst CGI I've seen since 1997. Really awful. It's hard to find any positives, but it gave me and my son a good giggle, and it sent me into a sweet reverie about beautiful 90s Brendan Fraser and Jerry Maguire era Cruise. That really is the best I've got. Sorry. I have hope that it's just about schlocky enough that it might one day be a cult classic. Perhaps. Don't watch it though, it's terrible. Seriously, really bad.",The Mummy
939,nyahaox,One more fun to watch Mummy movie,8,15 November 2017,"When I decided to watch this Mummy movie I didn't have high expectations. Finally having a female mummy and Tom Cruise was good enough reason for me to watch it and I wasn't disappointed. Mummy(2017) follows the usual Mummy recipe in a slightly darker tone so if you liked the other Mummy movies you won't dislike that one. Sofia Boutella (was amazing as Gazelle in the first kinsman movie) is great as Amunet-Mummy and the quite old but still good Tom Cruise is a good pick for the role of the adventurous protagonist. There is also Russel Crowe playing Dr Jekkyl as a refreshing touch. That's about it.If you expect something more, like a unique breathtaking plot, you will be disappointed. I give it a 8/10 rating since I think that this movie did the right thing by keeping it simple and for the selection of Sofia Boutella as Amunet- Mummy.",The Mummy

947,andreasbrostromabs,How hard can decent writing really be?,5,10 April 2019,"The main asset for any adventure/mystery movie is mood and atmosphere and it is here that Universals Mummy reboot fails from the start. Universal, apparently saddened, that they don't have any super hero franchise where they can get Spiderman or Superman to jump around, fight and blow stuff up decides instead to get the Mummy to jump around, fight and blow stuff up. One of the horror genres most beloved monsters becomes just another action figure.This is apparent right from the beginning when the mummy's tomb is discovered. There is no sense of awe or ancient secrets or anything. Nothing. In they go, crack a few lame jokes and off we go.Tom Cruise plays the charming rascal who is the main character. Some eyebrows were raised that he decided to be in this one but honestly -what is wrong with being in a monster movie? That the Mummy is not a particularly good one is not his fault (unless he was somehow involved with the script)Tom is a treasure hunter who uses his real job as recon in Iraq as cover to loot for treasure. He gets in to trouble so they call in a air strike to their exact location (cause that is the reasonable thing to do - right?). The missiles make a huge hole and the mummy is dicovered.They correctly observe that this is a priceless find but alas, the heavily armed american military needs to abandon it because there are rumours that insurgents on pick up truck might be approaching.The plane flows to England for unclear reasons where a swarm of ravens bring it down with Cruise still on board. He does not die however but wake in a hospital with a toe-tag. Now everything becomes really unclear - has he become immortal or just to planes brought down by ravens and could still be killed by for example choking on a prune? What are the rules here?The mummy that now has started jumping around and blowing things up also has unclear powers - at one point near invincible and at the next can be wrestled down by some guys.Her plan is to use Tom to resurrect Seth the god of death which should be scary but is not.Another example of big budget/bad script.

If you're expecting Oscar winning performances, dozens of action scenes, jump out of your seat scary moments or a complicated storyline where you'll feel more intelligent for watching it? then don't watch it.

A few days later I started it again. I made it maybe 5 mins past where I finished before. My husband watched about half. He had no idea I entered Valinor. The next morning it dawned on me why my skin looked better and I felt rested. My days went by but my nights, oh my nights, I could not wait to get home and turn this movie on. If only it could have lasted as long as blade runner 2049. Sadly the credits have ended. I cannot tell you any true details of the movie.
