0,TheLittleSongbird,Soldiering on,9,28 July 2018,"Absolutely love the first 'Sicario', a strong contender for Denis Villeneuve's (have a great personal admiration for him) best and a tour-De-force of film-making. It is superbly well made, directed and acted, is tightly written, tense and uncompromising in atmosphere.So when hearing that there was going to be a sequel, part of me was excited. Due to Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro returning, as well as Taylor Sheridan as writer, and being intrigued by the concept. Part of me was also apprehensive, with it not being as acclaimed critically and whether the new cinematographer, director and composer would do well filling big shoes. Friend word of mouth was positive and it actually looked good, so that was enough to make me see it. Am so glad of giving it a chance, for me 'Sicario: Soldado' had a lot to live up to and managed to be almost as great as its predecessor, definitely one of my favourite recent film viewings and compares favourably with other 2018 films seen so far.Catherine Keener and Matthew Modine are basically window-dressing but 'Sicario: Soldado's' main, and only big one, problem is the ending (or last ten minutes), which strained credulity and was both rushed and anti-climactic.However, even with a different focus (focusing less on the drug war compared to the first film) but the spirit, basic core and amorality present before are still maintained and doesn't radically change much and things are elaborated upon..'Sicario: Soldado' is impeccably made for starters, the setting is both audacious and visceral in showing the horrors and brutality of the setting and the editing is tight, stylish and enhances the brutal atmosphere. The cinematography is not Roger Deakins, but there are no signs of slouching with Dariusz Wolski whose cinematography is just as stunning and dark in grit, doing almost as amazing a job at bringing out the visceral horror.The music score is haunting and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation. The sound editing is suitably authentic and Taylor Sheridan's script is just as tightly structured and complex as before. Stefano Sollima's direction has class and matches the beautiful darkness and especially the hard edge Villeneuve showed in 'Sicario' without being an imitation.The story is just as taut and compelling, if not quite as energetic, having lost none of the brutality and edge that was there before. The setting, atmosphere and subject are neither overdone or sugar-coated, instead being suitably murky and dark. There are brilliant moments here, especially the suicide bomb attack which was nail-biting and superbly staged. The shocking execution scene and the adept choreography of the gun battles also impress.All the performances are never less than strong. Benecio Del Toro is nothing short of extraordinary, he is absolutely chilling but brings a conflicted edge that gives Alejandro complexity and stops him from being one-dimensional. Josh Brolin doesn't have as much to do this time round but all the qualities his performance had in the first film are present here. Isabela Moner more than holds her own and has impressive moments, her character easily could have been annoying but actually found myself feeling for her more than once.Overall, a great much better than expected sequel to a masterwork. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than the first,7,5 May 2019,"Unlike most reviewers I found this SICARIO follow-up to be superior to the first. Emily Blunt took me out of the first film in a big way; I never found her character convincing for a second and much preferred the performances of Brolin and Del Toro. The good news is that they're back but she isn't. The plot once again involves American interference in cartel politics south of the border; there's a big mission to carry out and some great suspense sequences as everything goes very wrong indeed. I find DAY OF THE SOLDADO's director to be in command of his film in every respect, whether it's the cinematic grittiness, the lack of a moral compass, the superb action scenes or the incessant foreboding that carries the story through.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
2,SnoopyStyle,worthwhile sequel,7,20 September 2018,"An Islamic suicide bomber is caught crossing the Mexican American border. A Kansas City grocery store is attacked by multiple Islamic suicide bombers. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is in Somali interrogating a pirate in the investigation. The bombers are presumed to be Yemeni terrorists transported to Mexico by sea and smuggled in by the drug cartels. The cartels are declared terrorist organization. Graver is brought in to take them down. He recruits Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) to kidnap cartel kingpin's daughter Isabel Reyes and laying the suspicion on a rival cartel. Meanwhile, American teenager Miguel Hernandez has joined the cartel to be a soldado.This sequel has some of the kinetic energy of the original. It has Del Toro and Brolin returning. The suicide bomber crossing the border is questionable. It seems like a tougher step than necessary. There is a fleeting explanation of the Kansas City bombing which leaves the crossing even more questionable. Instead something less blow-em up and reasonable, the movie wants to start with a bang. Same thing happens with the hand-off to the Mexican police. I don't understand why they would try to ambush them. It would be easier to trick them into transferring Isabel to them. The shootout can happen when something goes wrong with the exchange. There are things happening that don't quite seem right although much of it can be attributed to the randomness of a chaotic situation. Overall, there is a kinetic thrill to diving back into this world. The actors are compelling. It may not be a necessary sequel but it's a worthwhile sequel.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
3,Horst_In_Translation,(Almost) a worthy successor that delivers in its own right too,6,25 July 2018,"""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is a new American/Italian 2-hour movie released this year in 2018 and the writer is Italian Stefano Sollima as Denis Villeneuve did not return for this sequel, but the script is again by recent Oscar nominee Taylor Sheridan, maybe the biggest new star when it comes to writers who were actors previously (and still are to some extent). If you have seen the first ""Sicario"", you vaguely know what to expect here. Or do you really? Well, at least in terms of atmosphere, grit and tone I guess. Music as well, even if Jóhann Jóhannsson died under tragic circumstances. But yeah, honestly I did not see too many parallels. Brolin and Del Toro are back at the center of it all, but Blunt is not. And the two guys' characters feel like something from a completely different film too at times. The parallels are just not too frequent or considerable I must say, this could have worked as a standalone film for sure too. But yeah, they obviously wanted to get many of these who loved the original back into the theaters and you cannot blame them for that. The two main characters are not as evil this time or well lets say more on the good side as obviously Blunt could not take that idealistic filler again. The subject is also completely different. The sicario/contract killer element is almost non-existent this time with the exception of the ending that hints at a third film even maybe, maybe one with Del Toro only. He is probably the star of the franchise as he came close to the Oscar nomination in the first film.But back to this one here: There are many pretty good moments in my opinion, some that may have you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere and locations fit in very well with the story overall too. The acting is good from start to finish. The element of bad luck / coincidence that almost costs Del Toro's character his life in the end was very smart and intriguing on ""No Country for Old Men"" level when he sees the teenager early on in a fairly tragic meeting. The story with the girl does not feel like one initially that will really play a huge role until the very end, but the way it did, it worked without a doubt. What else? Sound mixing and design are top-notch without a doubt, maybe the area where the film has the best chance for an Oscar nomination. The same amount like the first it will not receive again, but that's fine as I think it is slightly inferior to the first, but regardless of the question whether you liked the first, it's worth seeing. A far more masculine film this time for sure. The way Del Toro basically comes back from the dead is fairly epic to be honest, shocking stuff, also his ride in the car later on. In short, I'd definitely watch a third Sicario movie if they decide to make one two or three years from now. Moments of ""cool comedy"" if you want to call it like that are a rarity, it's all about the drama this time. Any major weaknesses? Perhaps the politics involvement, but also only because it's probably not on par with everything else, not because it's bad or something. It actually makes very much sense and shows convincingly how even the strongest and best trained men run out of options when it comes to saving themselves from the influential ones in suits. The more I think about it, the better it works too, maybe just a bit underelaborated or for the sake of it all. Does not take away from the overall quality of these 120 minutes. Not at all. No hesitation for me when deciding between thumbs-up and thumbs-down, it's the former of course. Go see it. On the big screen.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
4,Prismark10,Nihilistic politics,1,26 September 2018,"I thought this was a thriller about taking on Mexican cartels. What is a Muslim suicide bomber doing on the US/Mexico border? Next a Kansas supermarket is blown up by more suicide bombers. What was that woman with the little kid doing going near the bomber? Run to the other side of the store for goodness sake.In this garbage sequel with a repellent viewpoint that taps into the paranoia of Trump's views on the Mexican/US border. The US government has declared war on the Mexican cartels for transporting Islamist terrorists into the USA from Mexico.Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is tasked to start a war between the cartels by arranging the kidnapping of the daughter of one of the bosses. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) joins Graver. The the father of the girl they plan to kidnap killed Alejandro's family.The film starts off with some kind of a story, then somehow it ends up in a muddle with a lot of brutal violence. The plot to kidnap the girl just turns unnecessarily convoluted simply because the writer ran out of a plot, so he has to string something up.You have the side story of a teenage American hispanic boy who joins one of the gangs as a foot soldier to get people across the border. This boy has bionic eyesight as he can spot an undercover agent in the dark from some distance.This is a clumsy, mean spirited, cynically racist film.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
5,claudio_carvalho,Messy and Flawed,5,21 October 2018,"When three terrorists explodes a supermarket in America, the American government believes the responsible were the Mexican cartels smuggling terrorists to America. They decide to begin a war among the cartels and an unofficial command is assigned to kidnap the daughter of a kingpin and release her in the land of another cartel. However, when the government discovers that the responsible for the terrorist attack were American citizens from New Jersey, they decide to abort the plan and kill the girl. But things go wrong and do not happen as planned.""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is a messy and flawed film with great action scenes. There are so many plot holes that make no sense unless the viewer is brainless. The stupid beginning is absolutely pointless. The terrorist attack to the supermarket is an excellent scene, but the attitude of the mother heading with her child toward the last terrorist in the opposite direction people are running is senseless. The scene of Isabel Reyes fighting at school is another pointless scene. Why the Mexican police officers in the seven cars that joined the three American cars start shooting the American team? Why Alejandro risks his life to save the annoying girl? How can the teenager recognize a man that he glanced at in a car for a few seconds in the parking area of a supermarket in Texas? Why take Isabel to the witness protection program? How Alejandro crossed the border and was hospitalized? There are so many other questions about this flick that would take lots of time to write. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Sicário: Dia do Soldado"" (""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"")",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
6,nogodnomasters,"You wanted Afghanistan, you got it.",6,25 July 2018,"It seems Mexican cartels, as suggested by Fox News are bringing terrorists across the southern border. When a mall in middle American becomes a target, cartels are labeled as terrorists which changes how we deal with them. The brain child idea is to kidnap the daughter of Kingpin Reyes, and start a war among the cartels, because they never fight with each other. This gets hosed, because all Mexican police work for the cartels. Film has interesting twists, I just couldn't get into it. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
7,kosmasp,Follow up,8,18 October 2018,"The original still stands out and is overall better than the sequel. But this comes really close. As sequels go, this is really one of the better ones, which is not a bad thing to say about a movie that people will compare to a movie that seemed to be coming out of the blue and surprising a lot of people. In a good sense, but also with the level of violence and it's nature, which was along the lines of take no prisoners.It didn't wash things or make them easier to chew for viewers and the sequel swims along the same lines. Even if it is more straight forward and at this point in time we know the two main actors/characters in this. You shouldn't be squeamish and you should not mind explicit violence depicted in movies. Moral standards may seem out of place, but then again there is still a code for some people ...",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
8,classicsoncall,"""Dirty is exactly why you're here.""",8,7 September 2019,"'Day of the Soldado' may not be as riveting or compelling as the first film in the franchise, but that doesn't suggest it's not recommended viewing. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro reprise their roles from 2015's ""Sicario"" in a story that's somewhat easier to follow, even if it shares the same goal of 'shaking the tree to create chaos', a descriptive employed in the earlier picture. With a goal of starting a war between rival Mexican drug cartels, Matt Graver's (Brolin) inter-agency task force employs the services of Del Toro's character Alejandro to facilitate the abduction of a cartel kingpin's daughter, while making it look like the work of an opposing gang. A complication arises when a newly recruited youth of the Reyes faction recognizes Alejandro from a border crossing confrontation, while Mexican authorities in the pocket of Carlos Reyes unsuccessfully ambush American forces led by Graver. In the midst now of an international situation about to blow up, Graver is presented with the unpleasant task of making the entire operation disappear, a dilemma that forces him to defy orders while still keeping faith with the original objective.I have to say, Benicio Del Toro really earned his paycheck with this picture. After being shot and left for dead in the middle of the Mexican desert, Alejandro squirms his way through the dirt and grime of his environment to eventually make it to safety. One can applaud the effort, but it does set up a somewhat unlikely resolution and final scene in which Alejandro, bearing none of the scars of a bullet miraculously passing through both cheeks, confronts the young cartel recruit Miguel (Elijah Rodriguez) who delivered that near fatal gunshot. The abrupt ending to the story tends to leave the viewer somewhat disoriented, while suggesting yet another sequel to determine the fates of various characters who went off screen with no fanfare.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
9,jboothmillard,Sicario 2: Soldado,5,9 September 2021,"I saw the first film in the cinema, and it was good, I didn't go to see the second film for some reason, but I'm glad I watched it eventually, written by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River). Basically, in Kansas City, fifteen people killed in a grocery store by terrorist suicide bombing. In response, the United States government orders CIA officer Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), with assistance from the Department of Defense, is assigned to investigate the war between the major cartels. Graver recruits operative Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) for the mission. Graver also meets with weapons trafficker Andy Wheeldon (Shea Whigham) to secure mercenaries, helicopters, and military-grade communication equipment so the U. S. can maintain plausible deniability while combating the Mexican cartels. Gillick assassinates a high-profile Matamoros cartel lawyer in Mexico City while Graver and his team capture Isabel Reyes (Isabela Merced), the daughter of kingpin Carlos Reyes (who previously ordered the killing of Gillick's family). Isabel is taken to a safe house in Texas, and Graver, Gillick and their team stage a DEA raid and pretend to rescue her, making her believe that she had been captured by the Matamoros cartel. She is then taken to an American military base while her return to Mexico is organised. They plan to leave her at a Mexican Federal Police depot located in the territory controlled by her father's rivals to further escalate the inter-cartel conflict. However, after they cross into Mexico, the corrupt police escort turns against them and attacks the American armoured vehicles. In the ensuing firefight, Graver and his team kill twenty-five Mexican policemen to escape the ambush. During the chaos, Isabel runs away into the desert. Gillick goes after her alone while the rest of the team returns to the United States. Meanwhile, the American government determines that at least two of the suicide bombers in Kansas City were domestic terrorists rather than foreign, and thus were not smuggled into the United States by the cartels. To subdue tensions with Mexico, the Secretary of Defense orders the CIA to abandon the mission. Learning that Isabel witnessed the Americans shooting the Mexican police, the Secretary orders that all proof of American involvement is erased, and to kill Isabel and Gillick. Graver warns Gillick and orders him to kill Isabel, but Gillick refuses and turns rogue to keep her alive. Both shelter at an isolated farm in the desert for the night. Gillick knows that Isabel will be killed if they stay in Mexico. With few resources, they disguise themselves as illegal immigrants and pay human traffickers to help them re-enter the United States. Graver and his team fly covertly into Mexico on Black Hawks, tracking a GPS device activated by Gillick. Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez), a young Mexican-American recruited to be a coyote (a person who smuggles immigrants across the Mexico-United States border), recognises Gillick at the border from a previous encounter. He alerts his boss who takes Gillick and Isabel hostage. Miguel is upset when he is forced to shoot a hooded Gillick in the head, and he abandons the gang. Graver is watching live satellite imaging when he witnesses the apparent killing of Gillick. He and his team track down and eliminate the Mexican gang and rescue Isabel. Ignoring his orders to kill her, Graver decides to bring Isabel back to the U. S. and place her in witness protection. Meanwhile, Gillick regains consciousness, he was only shot through the cheek. He is chased by gang members, but he kills them by throwing a grenade into the pursuing car. One year later, Miguel is heavily tattooed and in the Texas mall where he first saw Gillick. He finds Gillick waiting for him in the office, he says to an inscrutable Miguel: ""So you want to be a sicario? Let's talk about your future."" Also starring Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Forsing, Catherine Keener as Cynthia Foards, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Gallo, Matthew Modine as James Riley, and Bruno Bichir as Angel. Brolin and Del Toro give good performances, I'm not going to pretend I paid the fullest attention to everything going on, especially the political stuff (my summary is mostly made up of what I've read elsewhere online), but the little girl in the middle of the chaos, the combat, and sequences full of guns blazing and explosions got my attention, it's an alright action crime thriller. Worth watching, in my opinion!",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
10,Tweekums,A solid sequel,8,18 September 2019,"Following a terrorist attack in an American shopping centre evidence points to Middle Eastern terrorists who have travelled by ship to Mexico before crossing the border illegally. As the cartels control the people smuggling business it is decided that they are to be targeted as terrorists. It is impossible to launch a full scale attack on Mexican soil so it is decided to start a war between the cartels. To this end Matt Graver, a CIA officer, enlists the help of Alejandro Gillick, a former Mexican prosecutor whose family was killed by the Reyes Cartel. First they assassinate a lawyer working for an opposing cartel then they kidnap Reyes's daughter, Isabel. A fake rescue takes place and she is driven back to Mexico with the intention of dropping her in the territory of the rival cartel... unfortunately everything goes wrong; they are ambushed by their police escort leaving Alejandro and Isabel alone in remote northern Mexico while Matt's superiors order him to clean up the mess.I don't think this film was quite as good as the first but it is still a very effective thriller. It nicely combines various modern concerns namely; Middle Eastern terrorism, Mexican cartels and the security of the US/Mexico border. You don't need to have seen the first film as this effectively introduces the key characters and the murky world they inhabit. Unlike most films in the genre there aren't really heroes and villains; the 'good guys' employ methods that go beyond what could be considered acceptable and the 'bad guys' we see are relatively low level, most not important to be named. The closest we get to a sympathetic character is Isabel Reyes... and when we first meet her she is fighting a classmate. Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin impress as protagonists Alejandro and Graver and young Isabela Moner is really good as Isabel. The action scenes are well handled and filmed in a way that makes the viewer feel part of the action. In between moments of action the tension is kept high; as the end approaches it is far from certain whether certain key characters will survive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of morally ambiguous thrillers.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

This is good Thriller with lots of action, impressive scenes and strong violence , the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker . A nice thriller has to keep you hooked on the edge of your seat and this one results to be tense for the whole movie. This Sicario II manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested and expecting throughout all of the time . Interesting and provoking script by screenwriter Taylor Sheridan , who wrote the story and screenplay for both films. This is the second entry , after Sicario (2015) by Denis Villeneuve, going on this acceptable outing in a proposed trilogy written by Taylor Sheridan and in pre-production a third installment with similar actors, writers and technicians . The word ""Sicario"" means ""hitman"" or ""gunman"" in Spanish. It also means ""paid assassin"" in Italian .The word ""Sicario"" derives from the Latin word ""Sicarius,"" meaning ""dagger man"". The term was used by Romans to describe Jewish zealots who killed Roman citizens using a ""sica"" or small dagger hidden in their cloaks. There were so many killings in the province of Judea around the 1st Century AD that's why the figure of ""Sicarius"" was codified in Roman law .The film features one Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro, and an Oscar nominee, Josh Brolin, both of whom delivering top-notch interpretation . Benicio del Toro as Alejandro is terrific , while in previous film his character hunts down and kills the biggest current drug kingpin, Fausto Alarcon , in this one Alejandro protects the drug baron's daughter . Josh Brolin gives a masterful acting , as well .The first part was played by Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro , Josh Brolin , Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan , Daniel Kaluuya , Victor Garber , Raoul Max Trujillo . This second outing is performed by some of them, adding the following ones : Isabel Merced , Catherine Keener , Shea Whigham , Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Matthew Modine.When discussing the soundtrack with composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, director Sollima said he wanted the the sound of a threat, this is the reason for the musical score is extremely punching, rousing and threatening. The film is dedicated to the memory of Jóhann Jóhannsson, the composer of the first and second film, who died in February 2018. The motion picture was competently directed by Italian director Stefano Sollima . He was born on May 4, 1966 in Rome, Lazio, Italy. He is a director and writer, known for Sicario (2018), Gomorra: the series (2014) , Crimini , La esquadra , Rome criminal , Zerzerzero and A.C.A.B. Rating 7/10 . Better than average . It will have you in tension throughout the film and your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end. Well worth watching.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
12,searchanddestroy-1,Great film but...,9,30 June 2018,"Let's be honest, it is a true authentic sequel of the Denis Villeneuve's picture but in this latest, I think Benicio Del Toro's character was more interesting, because more nasty than here. In this movie, his character is more predictable, pore classic, but I am still impatient to see the sequel of this one. because there wil be one.

13,grantss,Not to the same standard as the first Sicario but still reasonably entertaining,6,21 February 2020,"In an attempt to destabilise and weaken the Mexican drug cartels, US federal agent Matt Graver starts a war between rival cartels. His methods prove to be quite extreme.The first Sicario movie was great, and surprisingly so. It looked like it was going to be a fairly standard action-based cop drama. However, the plot was great, filled with unforeseen twists and turns and a large dose of mystery and intrigue. Director Denis Villeneuve built the intensity well, creating a slow-burn effect. Completing all this were some solid performances and realistic and gritty action sequences.This movie, while also written by Taylor Sheridan, is not directed by Denis Villeneuve...and it shows. This film is far more action-based with little in the way of intrigue or mystery. Rather than cerebral the plot is more conventional action-drama.The action scenes are very good though and there is a decent amount of character engagement, especially towards the end. All this makes it entertaining and watchable enough.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Reasonable sequel to SICARIO in a 'budding franchise' second chapter with Del Toro reprising his role as the Mexican hit man this time recruited by shady op Brolin for an American war on drugs with cartels and terrorists by incorporating a plan of kidnapping one of the gang lord's daughters that leads to further complications including vengeance, the price of doing the right thing and loyalty to one's own country.

15,view_and_review,"More Intricate, Less Gripping",7,30 June 2018,"Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) has been employed again by the U.S. to do some dirty work on Mexican soil. Again it involves the Mexican cartels but this time the cartels are smuggling something other than drugs: terrorists. That's all the U.S. government needs to take the gloves off and nip this problem in the bud.Sicario: Day of the Soldado (SDS) lacks a lot of the qualities the first installment had. I think three significant differences between Sicario and SDS were:1.) The first was a lot grittier and raw. It had a realistic unscripted feel to it. SDS was a bit more sanitized, bourgeois and crafted. It seemed more like a production instead of the pull-the-curtains-back aura of Sicario.2.) The first Sicario was a smaller yet intricate operation, the sequel was a lot larger operation although the intricacies remained. To some, bigger is better, but for me the smaller operation had more believability. In SDS the grander scale of what the ""spooks"" were trying to accomplish made it less believable and definitely less agreeable. 3.) Sicario had an excellent reveal at the end of the movie whereas SDS lacked that same ""Whoa!"" moment. We already know who and what Alejandro is when that was still a mystery in part one.SDS was still good, just not as good as its predecessor. Honestly, SDS would've had to be sensational for me to consider it as good as the first because I loved Sicario. But there is no harm in trying",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
16,neil-476,Better than Sicarion 1,7,9 July 2018,"Following a mass suicide bomb attack, it is determined that the Mexican drug cartels are trafficking terrorists as well as drugs and illegal immigrants across the border. The two prime operatives in the original film (but not Emily Blunt) are once more pressed into service.I didn't care much for the first film, perhaps because Emily Blunt was in it. I greatly preferred this one. It is true that the narrative rambles, but it manages to be gripping throughout, and the story is left wide open for a follow-up.I must single out Isabel Moner, aged 15 during filming, who is absolutely superb as drug baron's daughter Isabel Reyes. Starting out with the haughty conceit of a teen who is utterly spoilt and who knows that her father's power enables her to get away with whatever she wants to do, the change in her when she finds herself kidnapped and threatened with death is utterly convincing.There is a moment near the end when I went ""Wow! They did that?"" but I will say no more about it or its aftermath for fear of spoilering.I enjoyed this a lot more than its predecessor.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
17,morrison-dylan-fan,Soldado Sicario.,8,16 February 2019,"Finding a poll being held on ICM for the best films of 2018,I started looking for interesting flicks to view. Finding the first to be a gripping Thriller,I decided it was time to see the sicario hit out again.View on the film:Crossing the border to English-language cinema for the first time after scheduling conflicts on Blade Runner 2049 (2017) left Denis Villeneuve unable to return, director Stefano Sollima & cinematographer Dariusz Wolski continue building on the tough point blank range of the drama from the first Sicario, whilst giving the action scenes a more robust presentation.Pulling Alejandro and Isabel across the lines where loyalties become ambiguous on the border, Sollima and Wolski scorch the earth with burning yellows and ice cold blues backed by the drones of Hildur Guðnadóttir's score, which give the border a desert texture, and in lingering two-shots builds up a anxious atmosphere. Igniting a gang war, Sollima moves away from the striped-down approach of the first Sicario, to go all guns blazing with excellent fiery action scenes landing with quick-fire panning shots placing Graver and Alejandro in the centre of the unfolding war.Returning to the frontier of his first three films, the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan keeps Alejandro a wolf off the leash, but refines the psychological drive by his actions this time not only having to be about keeping himself alive, but also getting Isabel safely across. This time on their own with no moral doubts from Kate Macer. Sheridan gives Alejandro and Matt Graver's relationship an increasingly gruff edge, via each of them being determined to shove their own plans onto the other, rather than work as a team.Left for dead with a bloody rag shoved in his mouth, Benicio Del Toro makes an outstanding return as Alejandro, whose unflinching violent strikes are delivery by Del Toro with a brittleness, whilst subtly lighting an empathetic side when Isabel is threatened. Faced with the challenge not only of ruthless gangs but sharing the screen with Del Toro, Isabela Moner gives an terrific turn as Isabel, who is given by Moner a thoughtful maturity in having to place her trust in Alejandro, who fights to take her across the border.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
18,phd_travel,Exciting at first but gets too convoluted and unbelievable,4,24 February 2019,After watching so many true stories about the drug war in Narcos it's a change to see a fictional thriller. True stories are better. The story starts quite involving for a fictional work combining terrorism with border smuggling and drugs. It gets convoluted and a bit hard to follow the twists and turns. This fake kidnap plot and pitting the two cartels against one another is the crux. The end is just too unbelievable. Would these two men take so much trouble over her?Nice to see Benicio and Josh. But Isabel Moner as the kidnapped girl is the standout star who is really going places.,Sicario - Day of the Soldado
19,gradyharp,'You want to be a sicario... let's talk about your future...',8,28 January 2019,"Written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Stefano Sollima, SICARIO: Day of the Soldado is the third Sicario film that addresses the very current topic of immigration and the US/Mexican border corruption and tragedies. Of the three films this one is the more poignant as it deals with some sensitive personal issues among the characters. A 'sicario' translates to a 'hitman'The film opens with considerable excellent and moody cinematography rambling with helicopter views of the border art night as well as a suicide bombing in a Kansas City grocery store that kills fifteen people. The United States government responds by authorizing CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to apply extreme measures to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Graver and the Department of Defense decide the best option is to instigate a war between the major cartels, and Graver recruits black operative Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) for the mission. Gillick assassinates a high-profile lawyer of the Matamoros cartel in Mexico City while Graver and his team kidnap Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner), the daughter of the kingpin of their rival, in a false flag operation. Graver, Gillick, and their team take Isabel to Texas and stage a ""rescue"" with the DEA and local police to make her think she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. Gillick bonds with Isabel and the team makes plans to transport her back to Mexico, intending to leave her in territory controlled by her father's rivals in order to further escalate the conflict. However, the Mexican police escort for their trip back across the border double-cross them and attack the American vehicles. Graver and his team kill dozens of Mexican policemen to escape the ambush.Full of twists and turns the cast is uniformly excellent with additional roles enacted by Elijah Rodriguez, Catherine Keener, Matthew Modine, Jeffrey Donovan, Manuel Garcio-Rulfo, David Castañeda, Shea Whigham among others. The film is intense but moves well and inserts an ending that is particularly impressive and poignant. This is not an easy film to watch but it points out issues too few of us know.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

I thought I was going to be as much entertained as with Sicario, that was full of suspense, but the truth is that Sicario: Day Of The Soldado is coming no way near to the high level of the first movie. The story this time is weak and makes no sense at some points. The acting was good so it's not the fault of the cast. It's just the story that is the weakest link and that's just the most important part of a movie. The first movie was quality, this one is below average.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
22,siderite,When you just know this is the second part of a trilogy and nothing really happens,7,27 October 2018,"In the first Sicario we were shocked by the ruthlessness of American black operations furthering the hidden goals of the US government against criminals of immense power on the other side of the border. In the sequel, we get the same thing, only twice as bad. However, we don't have Emily Blunt to serve as our audience proxy, instead having a sixteen year old girl who can't really handle what is happening to her and it doesn't really work. But worst of all, in the first part of the movie we get to understand a rather despicable plan by the American agents, but in the second part of the movie we just get the beginning of another ""plan for the future"". It's so painfully obvious it's the setup for a third film because nothing is finalized or goes anywhere. It's just left in limbo after starting several story arcs. And it hurts, because overall it's a well done movie with too much of a sinuous plot with some rather gaping logical holes in it.Other than that the actors are pretty good, the mood ominous, the action scenes cool. However I feel that if you want to enjoy this film you need to wait for the third part of this Sicario trilogy. Don't expect something of the same quality as the first film, which in my opinion should have been left as standalone.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
23,Hellmant,Does just about as much as a good sequel can do.,9,29 June 2018,"'SICARIO: DAY OF SALDADO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2015 hit crime-thriller 'SICARIO'. This one has Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin reprising their roles as hitman Alejandro Gillick and CIA agent Matt Graver, who must team up to stop Mexican drug cartels from smuggling terrorists across the U.S. border. It costars Isabela Moner, Jeffrey Donovan (also reprising his role from the original), Catherine Keener, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Matthew Modine and Shea Whigham. The script was once again written by Taylor Sheridan, and the film was directed this time by Stefano Sollima. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, although not as good as the acclaimed original. I really enjoyed it as well, although not quite as much as the original also. Mexican drug cartels have been smuggling suicide bombers across the border, into the U.S., and CIA agent Matt Graver (Brolin) is tasked with stopping them. He brings in former undercover operative, turned mentally unstable hitman Alejandro Gillick (del Toro), to help him. They kidnap the young daughter of a drug lord, named Isabela Reyes (Moner), in an effort to cause war between the rival cartels. Things get out of control with the Mexican police, and the girl makes a run for it. Gillick is tasked with bringing her back.
 
The movie is intense almost for it's entirety. Some scenes go on a little too long, but it's mostly a pretty nonstop thrill ride. Del Toro and Brolin are both great in their roles, and the music score is absolutely awesome. The absence of Emily Blunt's character is a noticeable lesser quality to this sequel though, and it just isn't quite as original or shocking. It does just about as much as a good sequel can do though, and I look forward to seeing another one.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Unexpected, pleasantly surprising second inslament of the series",9,13 July 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA recent spate of illegal migrants crossing the Mexican border has resulted in a series of terrorist attacks on US soil. To combat this, Agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is assigned to wage an all out war on the cartels, pitting them against each other so they wipe themselves out. To do this, he reunites with his old associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) in Mexico, where a plot is hatched to kidnap Isabel (Isabela Moner), the daughter of one of the main cartel heads. But events spiral out of hand, and the two men find themselves embroiled in a series of twists and turns with devastating consequences.The 2015 cartel thriller Sicario remains one of the better films of the last several years, with it's realistic, hard hitting nosedive into the brutal world of Mexican drug cartels and those trying to bring them down. All the same, I expected it to be a great film in and of itself, and wasn't really expecting a follow up film of any sort. Nevertheless, here one is, from director Stefano Sollima and writer Taylor Sheridan. To be honest, I think its generic marketing as Sicario 2, like some standard, low grade straight to DVD entry, has done it no favours and may have put some off. Hopefully as few as possible, for this emerges as one of those rare second instalments that proves every bit as riveting and unflinching (if not more so!) than its predecessor.Sollima shoves us in from the get go, reapplying the dark, moody cinematography and imposing score that worked so well last time round. Returning stars Brolin and Del Toro also display the intense, brooding personas that made their roles in the last film so special. Its all the same ingredients from the last film with a different script, only on a more ambitious and dynamic scale. With the current political climate, it's hard not to detect some kind of statement being made, and the depiction of refugees masking potential terror suspects won't be lost to anyone more sympathetic to Trump's immigration policies. Luckily, though, it's subtle and nuanced rather than rammed down your throat or in your face. It's not that the last film didn't require a sequel, it's just nobody expected one, but this follow up has raised the high standard left by the last film and the result is a pleasant surprise. If you can just forgive an ending that drags on a bit too long, this certainly whets the appetite for a third (and hopefully maybe!) last part to come around. ****",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The lack of the original's protagonist is keenly felt; a disappointing follow-up.,5,2 July 2018,"Without the original's 'Kate' (Emily Blunt) character, 'Sicario 2: Soldado (2018)' is, essentially, lost. It meanders about between aimless plot-strands and seemingly pointless cutaways until it finally lands upon its mainline narrative and, only then, begins to pick up some steam. Still, it's constantly brought down by the fact we have no-one to properly root for. When a 'hero' does finally emerge, he's done so many downright despicable things - some of which were integral to his deft development in the first film - that his newfound protagonism is both entirely out of character and all but impossible to take seriously or, at least, in good faith. See, the first film's protagonist didn't just act as a lens for the audience, a surrogate for the viewer who could be introduced to 'alien' elements at an equal pace, but also as someone understandable to root for, a way into this seedy world that we could fully follow and empathise with. She also acted as an apt moral counter-point to the incredibly shady government goings-on that formed the basis for that picture and most of this one. Basically, she was a fully formed and well-developed character. Not only does this flick fail to include a character who can do the former 'audience investment' stuff, it doesn't even manage to include one who fulfils the latter 'well-rounded' one, either. At the end of the day, even the evilest of characters can be somewhat empathetic if done right. To be fair, there is one scene of decent development here. It comes quite late on but does add something to our core player, however simple it may be, while providing a brief opportunity for a less stone-faced performance. The rest of the time, though, there isn't much going on. Again, it may be more to do with the fact we now have a demystified 'mysterious man' acting as our 'main character', which doesn't really work as we should know what's going on with our protagonist at pretty much all times. Still, if they were going down this route, they could've done it better. Some of the characterisation, like I mentioned, feels like it betrays what we learnt about this guy from the previous film. As do a few key decisions made by another core player later on, and a larger situation that seems misplaced in a slightly more 'meta' way. Of course, none of this is helped by the fact that the movie itself is a mess, to the point that even its central message is hard to discern and perhaps counter to the one intended. It feels like it might want to push a specific idea, but does so by presenting itself as so far in the opposite direction - on the surface, at least - in the hope that that most viewers will have an 'oppositional reading' and thereby understand the initial intention. In the process, it boils down some fairly complex political climates to their most basic of elements and ends up removing all nuance it could've initially hoped to achieve, instead touching on hot-button subjects in a quite banal manner. The picture tries so desperately to replicate the original's dark, foreboding aesthetic that it just comes off as immaturely dour, despite some occasionally tense sequences perforating the poorly structured and essentially joyless plot. Some of these are well executed, including a decently suspenseful scene that clearly tries to ape the 'highway' sequence from Villeneuve's picture to good, if nowhere near as good, effect. Overall, the direction isn't bad. It doesn't live up to the aforementioned director's initial attempt, but few people can match up to him anyway. There are moments in this piece that have a nasty, 'everyone goes out kicking and screaming' kind of vibe and it works well for the story trying to be told. Nothing here seems as deliberate or well thought-out as anything in any of Taylor Sheridan's other writing efforts, though. I can't say that I enjoyed the film, nor that it gave me anything to really 'chew' on in the way that the first did. There are moments that work fairly well, but I didn't find myself affected by it, just disappointed. 5/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
27,dromasca,just another action movie,5,23 July 2020,"In order to be successful, sequel films must reconcile two contradictory conditions. On one hand, they must keep a continuity of theme and characters with the original film in order to attract the spectators who remember it well. On the other hand, they must bring a sufficient degree of innovation and novelty, perhaps different points of view or new characters that arouse the interest of viewers who have not seen the original film or those who have not been enthusiastic about it. It is not an easy task, and comparisons are in more cases unfavorable than favorable. The film that opened the series 'Sicario' managed to bring to the audience a violent story from the world of drug trafficking on the American-Mexican border that fully satisfied fans of the genre, but also raised moral issues about the limits of the law and the justification of unconventional methods in the fight against criminal organizations that have no scruples and no limits in their actions. The quality of the film lied precisely in these issues that were beyond the regular patterns of action films. 'Sicario - Day of the Soldado' also follows all the rules of the action movies but fails to offer anything extra.The opening is promising. A night mission on the porous border between Mexico and the USA is filmed in a style that continues what we have seen in 'Sicario'. A terrorist attack committed a few days later in the heart of America indicates that the action is combined with a story of fighting international terrorism. In fact, if additional justifications were needed to add violence to a film taking place in this part of the world, these scenes explain why methods of combating Islamic terrorism are applied in the area of drug trafficking controlled by Mexican cartels. Two of the well-known heroes of 'Sicario' return - Matt Graver, the 'specialist' in the fight against crime and terrorism by any means (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro, the executor under his subordination (Benicio Del Toro) whom we know from the first 'Sicario' that he has everything reasons to take revenge on Mexican gangsters. However, the character who compensated for the violent violence and asked questions about the methods used, which had been played in the original film by Emily Blunt, is missing. Something of her humanity is transferred to the character of Alejandro, but this is not enough.'Sicario - Day of the Soldado' works OK as an action movie. The story is believable only by accepting the conventions of the action movies, but as soon as these are accepted it offers the opportunity of some excellent action scenes filmed in the deserts on both sides of the border. The director of the film is the Italian Stefano Sollima, at his first feature film in Hollywood, and I think there will be more, because from the point of view of cinematography and the fluency of the story telling there is no visible fall compared to Denis Villeneuve's version. Benicio Del Toro shows what a fine actor he is and manages to add something extra to the role of the hitman ('sicario') with a significant life story. The scenes in the desert in which he manages to gain the trust of the teenager he kidnapped at the behest of his bosses are perhaps the best in the film. Josh Brolin does what is expected of him and adds to his personal filmography another role of tough hero in action movies. Fans of the genre will be satisfied. However, those who saw and appreciated the first 'Sicario' risk being disappointed. The ending seems to draw one of the possible directions of the third series. The producers have already announced that this is a trilogy. I hope that at least some of the complexity and narrative qualities atop of the action will reappear in the third film. The second in the series is just another catchy action movie.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
28,ThomasDrufke,A Downgrade But Not Without Its Moments,6,12 July 2018,"There's something very clearly missing from Sicario 2, and that's a character that the audience can root for. Even though Emily Blunt was nowhere near the standout in the first film, she played a character that the audience could root for and was essentially how you followed the plot of the story. However, Day of the Soldado doesn't have that. Instead, we watch Brolin and Del Toro play one corrupt side and the other side consists of the cartels. I found myself not being able to figure if I should really be rooting for the protagonists. And perhaps that's kind of the idea. In fact, most of Taylor Sheridan's previous work/characters often have significant flaws so that they seem more realistic and conflicted. I wonder how this film would have played out with Blunt returning or a character similar to her. Don't get me wrong, there are some gorgeously shot sequences, thrilling gun fights, and great performances. But it's missing the human element and doesn't feel as captivating as the first film. But even with that said, I'll take a third film any day of the week.6.3/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

30,lesleyharris30,"Has its Moments, but is Nowhere near as Refreshing as The Original,",7,19 November 2018,"Sicario: Day of the Saldado is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and an outstanding cast. The highlight of the film is without a doubt the two electric performances delivered by Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin, both as great as ever in their respective roles, bringing a great intensity in their performances.I will say that the film stumbles due to a lack of an everyman-type character, as Emily Blunt was in the first film, with Brolin and Del Toro, they are very much anti-heroes, but lean so much on either side of both villain and hero that it becomes too difficult to decide whether to route for them or not, which is intriguing when they are side characters, but a bit stressful when they are now the leads.I also was very disappointed by the lack of development or of feeding us with any new information on Alejandro. What worked so well with the first one was how mysterious he was, and what excited me so much about the announcement of a sequel was getting to learn more about the character, but upon seeing this film, I just left a little aggravated that I did not gain much more from the character that I did not already receive from the first Sicario.Had plenty of phenomenal moments, but riddled with flaws.

In retaliation he gives CIA operative Graver (Josh Brolin) carte blanche to start a war between the cartels by kidnapping the daughter of a kingpin. Graves hires a cold-blooded assassin (Benicio del Toro) to do the dirty work.Lacking the moral center and unexpected twists and turns of the first Sicario, Day of the Soldado is a leaner, meaner, more action-heavy sequel that seems to revel in killing Mexicans.

33,westsideschl,Whoa!,9,14 October 2018,"This was some hot action! A creative take on the usual US secret agencies going after Mexican drug cartels. The writer/director did their homework and were fairly accurate as far as I can tell from years of news reports & documentaries on that whole scene. Big bonus was the beautiful N. Mexico landscape. Also, their attention to detail was phenomenal such as the tied up wounded agent using a belt buckle to rip his wrist taping. The creative accents were also noteworthy such as the use of a deaf ""peasant"" assisting an agent. Background music & sound effects were exceptional. Finally, acting was spot on, and scarily noteworthy was Isabela Moner - she was so cold scary that a future lead in a ""Kick-Ass"" style film would fit her well.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
34,The-Sarkologist,Stunning,9,2 July 2018,"Woah, now this is one of those films that left me completely blown at the end. In fact I'm going to go as far as to suggest that it is even better than the original. Okay, you probably do need to see the original to get an idea of who the two main characters are, but still, it does manage to stand on its own in any case. The other thing is that there are so many twists, and the film certainly doesn't go in the way that you would expect it to go, that it pretty much left me stunned right through to the end.
 Anyway, the film opens by mentioning how people smuggling from Mexico into the United States is the new big thing, and then we have a terrorist attack in a supermarket in Kansas. Suspicion starts to fall upon the Mexican cartels, particularly since in a recent bust some prayer mats were discovered. So, our friend from the first movie is called in to basically shake up a few trees and get some information, and they suspect that the cartels are behind this new way of smuggling people into the United States. So, they decide that it would be best to start a war between the cartels.
 Well, this is where it get's interesting, because our Sicario from the first movie is called in to basically kick a hornet's nest in Mexico, which he does, and then they decide to kidnap the daughter of one of the cartel leaders and attempt to pin the blame on the other cartels, and then it starts to get really, really messy, but I'll leave it at that because, well, that would be giving way too much away.
 Actually, I do wonder at times what their actual plan is as it seems to be pretty convoluted. Also, we have some ambushes that aren't really explained either, but then again, when we are dealing with the Cartels we never actually know what is really going on. The thing is that these gangs generally want to shake the tree a bit, and use violence to extract whatever dues they can extract from others.
 One thing that came across from the other film is that there are a couple of scenes that seem to be completely unconnected, but if you know what's going on then you know that they will end up being connected somewhere along the line. This film is all about people smuggling, so of course we have a young Mexican-American being lured into the business, namely because he is American and can get through things that others can't. Then again, you also wonder whether if you are connected with such people if you are little more than expendable.
 I think they also try to confront you at times with the reality of the situation, but then again sometimes I wonder whether this film is just another dig at the Mexicans, one of the many groups that seem to be scapegoated at this time. Sure, there are concerns with the drug cartels down south, but there are things that also aren't mentioned, such as a lot of the people crossing from Mexico aren't actually Mexican - they are from further south. Still, despite that I did think that this was a pretty awesome film, and I don't feel that it demonises Mexicans as much as some would expect.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
35,cruise01,Enjoyed the visual action sequences but falls apart with its plot.,6,30 June 2018,"Sicario: Day of the Soldado (3 out of 5 stars).Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a decent action thriller film. That tries to live up to the original film which is still superior to this movie. It did not help with a new director and lacking a better plot. Denis Villeneuve direction on the first movie was unsettling and build up intensity throughout. It was missing in this film. Newcomer director Stefano Sollima does try to build the suspense with the similar music score from the first movie. But there was no build up and it did not lead to nowhere when the climax came around the corner. The plot was all over the place. Writer Taylor Sheridan who returned after the first movie; failed to capture what made that movie good. The story was forgettable and rather dull. It starts when a suicide bomber was crossing the border with some immigrants. Then, following a grocery store attack with three more suicide bombers. This string of attacks have been leading that terrorists have been using Mexico to get across to the U.S. The terrorists have been using the Mexican cartel to travel with the immigrants. Then, Matt (Josh Brolin) who works for the U.S. government decides it is time to play dirty by starting a war with everyone. By getting two cartels to start a war with each other. He brings Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) a sicario to help him start a war with the cartels. First, by kidnapping one of the cartels leader daughters Isabela (Isabela Moner). When the plan falls apart. And Matt is given orders that they need to wipe this operation clean and leave no witnesses behind including Isabela. Alejandro fails to deliver the task and instead tries to protect her from being killed by Matt or any other cartel that will be after her. The film does have a few good action sequences. With a convoy ambush and a couple of intense shoot outs. Also, has a sub plot involving a Mexican teenager who is living next to the border in Texas. And decides to work for some bad people in smuggling immigrants across the border. Which later crosses paths with the main characters. Benicio del Toro was at his best playing Alejandro. A Mexican hitman. The film does shed more light on him this time around. With him discussing to Isabela about his past and his family. Josh Brolin was good too playing a soldier that bends the rules to get what he wants. The film does disappoint when it leads this conflict with del Toro versus Brolin when they both want to do different things with there mission. Isabela Moner was good. Playing a character that gets mixed up with this conflict. Director Stefano Sollima does try to mimic the first film's direction. From some high tone music score that tries to build suspense and an unsettling feeling. But it lacks the build up. It built up to nothing with this sequel. Overall, Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a fair thriller. Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin were great playing the characters. Newcomer Isabela Moner was great too. It had a few intense thrills. Including the opening scene of the terrorist attack. But it falls flat when it comes to a poor plot and dull direction.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

37,eddie_baggins,"Not up to the first films standards, Day of the Soldado is still a fine thriller",6,22 July 2018,"2015's Sicario seemingly came out of nowhere.Heralding in another impressive effort from its growing in stature director Denis Villeneuve, marking the feature debut of writer Taylor Sheridan and wowing critics the world over with its starkly beautiful and tension riddled examination of shady government activities and Mexican drug cartels, Sicario was a twisty turny thriller of the highest order.A problem with Sicario's unexpected successes and receptions is that now for its sequel, Day of the Soldado, the stakes have been raised and expectations in turn higher.It's expectations that Soldado can't quite meet, far from terrible it may be, the film can never get to where the now series found itself with Villeneuve, Emily Blunt and DOP Roger Deakins on board in the first incarnation.Things start off well and all looks set to be a welcome return to the gritty world created by Sheridan and new director Stefano Sollima, yet while the same slowly paced tone and unrelentingly grim outlook remains in place, Soldado's emotionally lacking and curiously directed narrative created by Sheridan never hook us the way in wish we would've liked.Sollima's film feels like a collection of sporadically great scenes and scattered gems from Sheridan rather than a highly cohesive whole and by the films last act there's an inescapable feeling that Soldado doesn't quite justify its existence outside of laying a foundation for another go-around for the series.In amongst all of this is a collection of solid enough acting turns with the first films MVP Benicio Del Toro once more stealing the show as efficient government hitman and all round trouble maker Alejandro.A mysterious and intriguing player in the 2015 outing, we get a much better look at Alejandro this time around, as he is once more recruited by Josh Brolin's gruff Federal Agent Matt Graver, this time to do a bout of cartel kidnapping to insight some over the border carnage, and Del Toro is up to the task.Both chillingly efficient and curiously human in his plight and actions, Alejandro is the heart and soul of Sollima and Sheridan's tale and when his in sight of the screen, Soldado's proficiently produced proceedings make for highly engaging viewing.Final Say -It was always going to be a tough task for Day of the Soldado to better its highly impressive predecessor, yet while it fails to reach those heights, there's enough here to suggest that this wannabe franchise still has legs moving forward, even if Sollima's newest entry is more middle of the road than it should've been.3 frag grenades out of 5",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
38,leonblackwood,Full of tension and great action! 7/10,7,3 January 2019,"Review:
I quite enjoyed this intense thriller, which isn't as good as the first movie but it surprisingly kept me on the edge of my seat. I was disappointed with the ending, which left a lot of unanswered questions, but apart from that, the gripping storyline made it a joy to watch. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro put in a terrific performance, but I would have liked to have seen a showdown between the two tough agents at the end. I also wanted to see the cartel kingpin who had lost his daughter, and I think that the US government should have been punished for making a right mess of a self-made war. Anyway, after a terrible suicide bombing in Kansas City in a grocery store, which kills fifteen people, the US government call on CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to apply extreme measures to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Graver and the Department of Defense decide the best option is to instigate a war between the major cartels, and Graver recruits black operative Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) for the mission. Gillick assassinates a high-profile lawyer of The Matamoros cartel in Mexico City while Graver and his team kidnap Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner), the daughter of the kingpin of their rival, in a false flag operation. Graver, Gillick and their team take Isabel to Texas and stage a ""rescue"" with the DEA and local police to make her think she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. Gillick bonds with Isabel and the team makes plans to transport her back to Mexico, intending to leave her in territory controlled by her father's rivals in order to further escalate the conflict. However, the Mexican police escort for their trip back across the border, double-cross them and attack the American vehicles. Graver and his team kill dozens of Mexican policemen to escape the ambush. Isabel flees the scene amidst the chaos and Gillick goes after her alone. Meanwhile, the American government determines that at least two of the suicide bombers in Kansas City were actually domestic terrorists, not foreign nationals, and thus were not smuggled into the US by the cartels. In order to quell tensions with Mexico, the Secretary of Defense orders the CIA to abandon the mission and erase all proof of American involvement by having Isabel and Gillick killed as part of the cover-up. Graver orders Gillick to kill Isabel but he refuses and runs rogue to keep her alive. Gillick knows that Isabel will be killed if they stay in Mexico, so they move to enter the US disguised as illegal immigrants. From there it turns into a kind of road movie, which definitely has its intense moments, but Gillick tries his utmost to keep Isabel alive. The ending did seem a bit rushed, but the director cleverly left it open for a next episode. I am interested in seeing Brolin and Del Toro progress through this franchise, as there is unfinished business to be resolved, and you really don't know if Del Toro is gunning for Brolin after leaving him for dead in the desert. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but it didn't have the impact of the first film. With that aside, the performances and the whole look and feel of the movie, make it feel like your in the heart of the action, and it definitely makes you question how far the government would go to cover up a mess that they created. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Stefano Sollima, who brought you the hit series Gomorrah and Campari: The Legend of Red Hand, which I haven't heard of. For his first movie for the big screen, he didn't let the franchise down, even though Emily Blunt didn't return in the lead. The storyline doesn't do the US government any favours, especially when it comes to them taking extreme measures to clean up their own mess, which might explain why the profit wasn't that huge. We are all used to seeing the American's being heroic and victorious but this film definitely shows a different side to there methods. Anyway, with Josh Brolin starring in some of the biggest movies in 2018, he surely doesn't disappoint in this movie. I just hope that they bring out another instalment soon because this franchise deserves a decent finale.Budget: $35million

39,TheMovieDiorama,Sicario 2: Soldado lacks the finesse of the original but increases the brutality and darkness of a continuous war.,8,30 June 2018,"Its predecessor had the perfect formula. Villeneuve, Blunt, Deakins and the late Jóhannsson. All vital components into making a hypnotically thrilling equation. With the release of a sequel, these elements have been removed. Del Toro, Brolin and Sheridan remain in an attempt to equal its predecessor. So, the big question, is it just as good? Simply put, yes. The drug war within the US-Mexico border rapidly escalates from smuggling substances to migrating terrorists. A CIA agent, tasked to deal with the situation regardless of the implications, hires a hitman bent on vengeance. The original opened a window to mainstream audiences, depicting the eternal grimness and brutality of the growing border patrol situation, whilst highlighting some humanity. To compare Soldado to its predecessor would be unfair, as it is succinctly different in various areas. The first film introduced us to these righteous semi-professional characters, this sequel acts as a platform to develop their domineering personalities as the world they are catapulted in continues to evolve. No longer are Mexican cartels smuggling drugs, the new trade is people. Cheaper, more efficient and harder to trace. The film immediately commences with a terrorist attack in a supermarket, ultimately setting the bleak tone for the rest of the runtime. Screenwriter Sheridan knew not to make a continuation of 'Sicario', so creating a separate story was a sagacious move and this immediate scenario acts as a clear motive for the main characters. Every move this team make either jeopardises the US government's position or the innocent family lives of the victims. Every explosion, every kill, every bullet. It felt incredibly fatalistic. ""Kidnap a prince, and the king will start the war"", an audacious line used by Sheridan that just highlights how sharp his writing style has remained. He continues to impress me. Sollima's directing style, although occasionally trying too hard to replicate Villeneuve's masterful touch, was consistently visceral with some picturesque landscape shots and thrillingly violent action sequences. Del Toro and Brolin both give physically demanding and mentally charged performances and work professionally well together. Guðnadóttir's score beautifully upheld Jóhannsson's haunting composition, from booming low bass to melancholic strings. Certain directions within the plot I did not necessarily agree with, particularly in the third act where a massive plot coincidence is predictably played, and any reasoning to create a third film would be eminently thin. Overall, the technical dream team may have dissipated but it is hardly noticeable. Soldado shows no mercy in portraying a world where trust is a luxury, yet you can trust Sheridan in writing a captivating story.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
40,Tweetienator,Another Bullseye,8,10 October 2021,"The sequel to Sicario (2015) is worth your time - a suspenseful story set in the drug war again, a great cast (Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin are excellent again, rest of the cast rock solid) and a big production make Sicario: Day of the Soldado another great action thriller. The only thing I gotta complain is that there is no Emily Blunt anymore, but anyway, this is finest movie making.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
41,paul-allaer,"Too convoluted and nowhere near as compelling as the original ""Sicario""",6,30 June 2018,"""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" (2018 release; 122 min.) brings the on-going chronicles of Matt Graver and Alejandro Gillick. As the movie opens, Middle Eastern suicide bombers attack a grocery store in Kansas City, killing dozens. We switch to Somalia, where Graver is interrogating a suspect with information on how those suicide bombers got into the US (via Mexico, of course). The US Secretary of Defense recalls Graves and orders him to do whatever is necessary to stop this from happening again. Graves recruits Gillick out of retirement in Bogota, and decides that the best way forward is to start a new war between Mexican the drug cartels... At this point we are less than 15 min, into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: while Sicario 2 is once again written by Taylor Sheridan, this time it is directed by Italian director Stefano Sollima, who made the excellent Italian mob drama ""Suburra"" a few years ago, This is his English language feature debut. Sollima takes on a near-impossible task, stepping into the shoes of Denis Villeneuve, to bring a worthy sequel of what was for me the best movie of 2015, period. Starting with a weak opening (remind me, what exactly is the connection between the Middle Eastern suicide bombers and the Mexican drug cartels?), to then work its way into an all-out battle between the ""good"" guys (Graves and Gillick) and the ""bad "" guys, the story line quickly becomes way too convoluted for its own good. Contrast this to the original ""Sicario"", where the story line had a laser-sharp focus from beginning to end. Josh Brolin (as Graves) and Benicio del Toro (as Gillick) bring top performances, but cannot hide the fact that this sequel seems to have no purpose of existing as such. Not to mention that the character played by Emily Blunt in the original ""Sicario"" is greatly missed. Beware: if you think the original ""Sicario"" was (too) violent, you are in for a shock, as the amount of violence in ""Soldado"" is borderline over the top.Despite all these negatives, there still are a number of sequences that are highly enjoyable, in particular the hair-raising traks across the US Mexican border. It is in those moments that we rediscover what mde the original ""Sicario"" such a classic in the first place. Alas, those scenes cannot make up for the obvious flaws of ""Soldado""... Last but certainly not least, the movie is dedicated to the memory of Johann Johannson, the Ielandic composer who scored the outstanding soundtrack of the original ""Sicario"" and sadly took his own life in February of this year (the score for ""Soldado"" is by another Icelandic musician, Hildur Guðnadóttir).""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" was one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2018 for me. It opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the last seat. It may well be that ""Soldado"" turns out to be great counter-programming to the popcorn mega-blockbusters that are ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", but that does not take away that ""Soldado"" is a flawed sequel to the original ""Sicario"". I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
42,subxerogravity,I thought this was pretty gangster.,8,30 June 2018,"I'm a little surprise that they made a sequel to Sicario. It was a good movie but it did not seem like the type of movie that you would make a sequel to. In a lot of ways I'm right cause this movie has very little connection to the last movie except for bringing back Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin.Brolin as Matt Graver is requested by the secretary of state for a covert operation that would put the Mexican cartels at war and he convinces Alejandro to help him, but things go wrong and the two men end up on different sides of the coin.To me the movie stands alone pretty nicely so that you don't need to know anything about the first movie to enjoy the drama. I feel the film has a lot going for it cause it was shoot well and it had cool dramatic music.Unnecessary sequel but not really a waste of time.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
43,jtindahouse,A sequel that does the original proud,8,4 June 2019,"While I did enjoy the original 'Sicario' I admit I found it a little slow paced and tedious in places. As with most sequels 'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' comes out with guns blazing (literally) trying to one up its predecessor. The first 2/3 of this film are electric and everything I wanted them to be. Then sadly the final 1/3 couldn't deliver the knock-out punch. It went down some channels that I wasn't particularly fond of, and ignored some that I would have loved to have seen. Don't get me wrong though, this is a very entertaining and well made film.Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are perfectly cast in these films. They are legitimately bad-ass. The rest of the cast however leave a little bit to be desired. Catherine Keener in particular was miscast and couldn't hold her own in any scene she was in. It didn't ruin the movie, more so it was just a distraction when she was on screen.The action scenes in this movie are quite incredible. The are shot in such creative and powerful ways. Only lacking in some casting errors and trailing off a little in the final 1/3, this film has a tremendous amount of watchability factor.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

This is the second of a trilogy-the first one was in 2015-centering on the Mexican drug cartels. In this one, the cartels are not just importing drugs, but people too-and some of them are actually terrorists. It's up to C.I.A. fixer Josh and his old buddy Benicio to try and set things right. Catherine is Josh's boss and a plan is hatched involving kidnapping a drug lord's daughter, Isabela, and blaming other cartels for the deed, getting them into a nasty war and maybe taking each other out. Of course, things do not always go according to plan and that's what makes things interesting. Josh and Benicio have a falling out on how the mission should go-to follow orders or not to follow orders, that is the question-and before it's all over, they may not be best buds anymore, that is, if they both manage to survive. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. But, after I heard that there is a part three coming later, the ending made a little more sense. FYI: For those not fluent in Spanish, Sicario means 'Hitman' & Soldado means 'Soldier'.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.

45,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Sicario: Day of the Soldado,4,20 July 2019,4/10 - boring and loud action drama brings nothing new to a crowded genre,Sicario - Day of the Soldado
46,alindsay-al,An average ultimatley disappointing thriller,5,5 July 2018,"I have been anticipating this film for quite some time, after the first Sicario film I was really looking forward to see Benicio Del Torro's character Alejandro given the spotlight this time. However, this film lacks the intrigue of the first and ultimately is a pretty boring film. The premise of the film sees after a terrorist attack, the US Government send a team into Mexico to attempt to take down these Cartels. As mentioned before this film gives Benicio Del Torro the lead and he does a great job, he plays this merciless killer incredibly well but he also adds humanity to the role that I don't feel too many people could. When it comes to others in this film, 2018 will be remembered as the year of Josh Brolin and he once again does a fine job in this film. I really liked his character and how his and del torro's relationship developed in this film and you see how they work together. There is also a young girl in this film and I thought the actress playing her did a really good job in the film and actually added some character to what could have been an irritating performance. Though there is this one young male character that has a story arc and I felt his character was so bland and dull and it really hurt his story arc which ended up being a large part of the film. The story to be honest is the weakest part of this film, it just tries to do too much. There are multiple story arcs going on and they don't always go together smoothly and because of the amount none of them are given enough depth for you to really care about them. Plus I wasn't personally a huge fan of the ending of the film. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue in it that sold how this film deals with a lot of immoral subjects in a very serious way. But when the film attempts humour it just doesn't really work and happens so little that it comes across as forced. The style has some decent action scenes that also deal with high tension, though they never last very long. Also the pacing of this film is pretty weak, it feel like ages between action scenes and makes the film feel longer then it actually is. Overall if you enjoyed the first Sicario you'll enjoy bits of this one but I feel like this one was a big step down in quality.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The movie stars Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Jeffrey Donovan, Isabela Moner, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Catherine Keener and Elijah Rodriguez.The movie might not be as good as the first part and lacks the intensity and the smartness but still the movie is quite entertaining and is filled with some great action scenes and stunning visuals. The movie will not disappoint you.The screenplay of the movie is fast paced and gripping, the movie gets slow in between but doesn't looses it's grip, the action scenes of this movie is better then it's previous part but lacks the emotional core the movie have the gritty cinematography and some stunning visuals. The problem with the movie is that this time the movie deviates from its plot of chasing and killing Drug Cartels and goes into the direction of politics coming between the operations and its influences on the plan and the aftermath of it and hence plays the spoiler.Acting is superb with Benicio del Toro & Josh Brolin, once again proves why they are being called superb actors, they again does their job with perfection. Isabela Moner was very impressive and made her presence felt in between the two heavy weights leads, Catherine Keener was good, Elijah Rodriguez was surprisingly impressive and had done a tremendous work. Rest all the characters were impressive.The climax of the movie is good and gives a hint of third part of the movie and if it all happens i am surely looking forward to the third part.The movie is not that bad and if you haven't seen the first part you will surely like this movie.

Now terrorists blow themselves up in a grocery store in the US. Matt is somewhere in Somalia interviewing some bad guy Jack-Bauer-style by threatening and going after the bad guy's family. The guy is some pirate kingpin. Apparently the terrorists are going to the US by crossing the Mexican border and they arrive in Mexico by sea. And since all ships are raided by the bad guy, Matt wants to know who paid this guy not to raid the ships with terrorists.Matt is back in the US and his handler takes him to the Pentagon where the government is also worried about human trafficking at the border. Matt comes up with a plan to start a war with/among the cartels by kidnapping one drug lord's (Reyes) daughter. Matt is given free-reign. He enlists Alejandro again and his CIA buddy Steve. For some reason apparently Reyes was behind the death of Alejandro's family, not the guy from the first movie. First they go after Reyes's lawyer. Then they kidnap the girl, lay the blame on a rival cartel, take her to the US, feign her rescue and try to deliver her to the Mexican military. That's when all hell breaks lose. They are escorted by Federales who then turn on our team and shoot them up. The girl escapes in the shoot-out. Alejandro decides to go after her on his own, while Matt and co. hurry back to the US. His handler and her bosses are livid and shut down the operation. That means cleaning up everything, including Alejandro. A parallel story is one of a teen living in the small US border town. His brother recruits him for the lucrative human trafficking business. This story meets the main story when Alejandro and the girl try to cross the US border as illegals. The traffickers realize who the girl is and the teen kid will have to show his chops--become a soldado by executing Alejandro. There's an unlikely turn of events and a very unsatisfying ending.I love the first Sicario; it's one of those movies I can't get enough of, whenever it's on I'll see it again. So expectations for this one were high. And whenever you have a movie with such fascinating obscure characters like Alejandro, Matt, and Steve there is a danger. The first Sicario was great because it just presents these characters without much of an intro, without much of a background and leaves us wanting more. The danger with a sequel is that they do exactly that, give us more of these characters, too much or more than necessary. And with Sicario II the writer fell for it and gave us a bit too much. And it also made the mistake of turning our characters against each other. The last thing you want to see is Matt and co. having to go after Alejandro. That would have been fine for a final installment of the series, not for a second movie. The movie also shoots itself in the foot big time when it leaves the terrorist angle aside completely. But the main problem is that it doesn't know what story it wants to tell or whether it even wants to tell one. Is it about terrorism? Is it about cartel wars? Is it about human trafficking? Not really. Maybe it's just about showing us choppers flying. It doesn't know what it wants. Well, it tries to pull at our heartstrings a bit too much by giving us some sad background about Alejandro's family and draws that bit out way too long. On the plus side, there's choppers flying, there is the occasional tension but nowhere near as unrelenting as the first. There are our three guys shooting guns. There's some interesting politics. There's the expectation that things will turn out great because you don't know where this is going, but the movie doesn't turn out as well as it could and should have. Matt's handler could have been a revelation here if they had made her more mysterious or given her an agenda. But they didn't take advantage of the character, making her instead rather unremarkable.The world of Sicario is of course fascinating. You have dark and darker operatives and their enemies. Here you don't have a villain, there isn't much at stake. Sicario II is directed efficiently taking inspiration from the first but lacking the punch of the original. But then there's the bizarre ending. I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the ending, not any test audience, not the director, not the editor, let alone the writer. What on earth happened there? It's like one of those endings where the studio stepped in and ordered re-shoots and took control away from the director. And don't believe the fake reviews that portray this movie as the greatest thing ever. As a stand-alone movie it's fine. If you haven't seen part I then perhaps this one gives a better impression. It's not clear who to blame for this lackluster movie, the director, the writer, the editor? Probably all of them. It's like the studio forced a sequel on a crew that didn't want to make one. Let's see if they can redeem themselves with part III.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

54,jadepietro,Border Lines are Drawn in This Action Thriller,8,4 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Taut action cannot hide an aggressive screenplay that loses its way in its complicated storytelling.JIM'S REVIEW: Suicide bombers attack unsuspecting shoppers at a supermarket. Governmental security forces stage a child kidnapping to incite international gang warfare. A Mexican-American teenager is slowly corrupted to join a drug cartel and bring illegal aliens into the U.S. Those plot threads slowly weave together to form a riveting but ultimately unsatisfying sequel named Sicario: Day of the Soldado (Translation: Hitman: Day of the Soldier).Sicario: Day of the Soldado takes these three distinct storylines in its complex narrative that shows everyone is bad south (and north) of the border. (Choosing any one of these heavy-duty, ripped-from-the headlines premises would have made for a more streamlined and impressive thriller with perhaps some self-editing and rewriting.) Corruption and double crosses reign supreme, the body count rises, and the film sadly reinforces the need for stricter border control. The cost is only one's body and soul. Manipulative and surely to be on Mr. Trump's best films of the year list, Sicario: Day of the Soldado tells its story with confidence and efficiency in the hands of its skillful director, Stefano Sollima, and its literate screenplay from the gifted writer, Taylor Sheridan. The film is a well-made political propaganda machine, shameless in its depiction of evil as it celebrates needless stereotypes with undue regard. No one, and I mean, no one has any semblance of humanity or ethics.That said, the film is highly effective in its storytelling (until it reaches its inconclusive conclusion). In this second installment, drugs take a sideline and human trafficking becomes the more profitable crime. The main plot involves two mercenaries, Matt Graver and his conflicted partner, Alejandro, both trained assassins-for-hire who become part of the collateral damage caused by the criminal chaos in Mexico. Their mission is to make it personal and create a civil war between drug cartels, involving the taking of the drug kingpin's feisty daughter (a wonderful Isabela Moner) for ransom.Back again are Josh Brolin who delivers another tough macho performance and a terrific Benicio Del Toro as his troubled soldier buddy. Their camaraderie brings added focus to the action and helps to define their characters more clearly. Strong support comes from Jeffrey Donovan, Catherine Keener, and Elijah Rodriguez. (Sorry, no Emily Blunt this time around to serve as a conscience.) The ever reliable Shea Whigham and Matthew Modine are given little screen time in sketchy roles.Mr. Sheridan's script continues to tackle important issues with his terse dialog and dramatic characters in his central plot structure but is unable to mesh the human trafficking angle and terrorist storyline satisfactorily. Both become mere throwaway plot devices and secondary to the film's convoluted mechanics. Too bad because the many action sequences, although extremely violent, are quite impressive and well staged. (Kudos to Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and the fine editing by Matthew Newman. One big misstep: Hildur Guðnadóttir's film score is far too obvious and intrusive with its dreaded over-orchestrated beginning bass notes that telegraph danger more often than John William's classic Jaws' score. At times, I was waiting for a shark attack sighting.)Depending on your own political affiliation, Sicario: Day of the Soldado won't make American great again, that seems more ironic than real message these days, but the craft and filmmaking on display will make one stand up and take notice, if nothing else.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
55,rgkarim,The Road To El Soldado,8,30 June 2018,"Sequels come and sequels come, and tonight is no different as the Sicario saga continues with yet another movie to its franchise. After an interesting start, the trailers painted this one much more on the action side as renegade cops go to fight against the cartels of Mexico. Did the dark seedy underbelly unleash into Die Hard like antics, or did it take another path. Robbie K is back with another movie review as he tackles: Movie: Sicario: The Day of Soldado (2018)Director:
 Stefano Sollima
Writer:
 Taylor Sheridan
Stars:
 Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin, Isabela Moner
LIKES: The Darkness: A movie like this requires pushing the limits of comfort and Sicario saga dives right back into the seedy underbelly to accomplish this goal. The dark atmosphere of the movie opens it up for a lot of twists and turns, and keep one guessing what will happen next to our band of ""heroes"". In terms of character development, the movie's edge cuts away the safety barriers to reveal deeper avenues to cut down to discover more about our players. The Story: Sicario has been primarily focused on exploring more into the characters than the situation itself and it continues this trend in spades. Del Toro's character takes most of the stage, but Moner and Brolin get ample screen time alongside a few other secondary characters to connect this Tex-Mex soap opera cast together. Pay attention to the deeper arcs, and you will find stories that should hopefully grip into you and pull you in. The Realism: Hollywood magic is fairly absent in this movie, as Sicario does its best to keep reality grounded into its mix. No major flashy, orchestra infused sequences that shake the screens and speakers. It's just straight up exploration and survival in the Mexican desert, and the savage symbolism it provides. Even when things get a little more exciting, the fights feel like a military skirmish instead of a choreographed battle that guys like me love. The Acting: By far, the acting is the solid point of this movie. A balanced demonstration of rugged military edge with terror is all mixed into this film and they play it beautifully. Brolin doesn't veer much from his rugged, singular emotion, but it works in regards to the character he is chosen to portray (military leader in charge of dirty work). Moner has the cartel princess down, snobby and fierce, yet vulnerable and capable of crumbling when the world is shaken. No surprise, it's Del Toro who kind of wins the acting nomination this round. Still filled with candor and a reserved fighting force that is ready to strike and accomplish the goals set by the program. Yet, the side once gone, starts to rear its head, and helps establishes deeper character bonds to help things out. All the acting accomplishes the goal of bringing the characters to life perfect for this character centric film series. The Justice: There are plenty of moments where that justice we wish would happen... actually happen and these moments plain out rock. I can't say much more than that so let's move on to the dislikes. DISLIKES: The Pace: The movie isn't quite as fast as its predecessor, and that can be taxing depending on how late your viewing starts. It works to explain the details and tie up loose ends, therefore taking up time to try and connect all the dots. Sadly, that pace, without the full excitement, does not lead to the most exciting film of the night, and you may be fighting sleep or boredom.Jargon/Politically Heavy: The movie's talking parts have some deeper story elements, but it is mostly focused on the strategy and political warfare that the drug busting operation is. You'll need to keep your wits sharp, your ears turned on, and your attention fully paid or you might just get confused about all the players' parts in this film. Some stretches: The movie's complicated and convoluted execution sometimes has to stretch a few things to get to its goal. Sometimes it's turning the blind eye to ignorance, and sometimes it's the rapid change of character, but Soldado's road is bumpy with these ignorant moments or sudden changes. Not awful, and not too much of a stretch, but still something you would have liked to see covered in. Story Elements Dropped: The movie is about bringing terrorists across the border, at least that is the excuse to start this whole mess. So perhaps you would expect more of this factor to come in, but that wasn't the case as this element disappeared. As the webs of deception, backstabbing, and hidden agendas start to entangle together, these plots points start to become shortened and sometimes quickly resolving. Needed a little more wrap up and integration for my tastes, but perhaps number three will take the cake. More Action: The trailer sold me on the loose cannon cops going after the dark masters of the illegal smuggling business and that was what I wanted. Yet, while realistic the sequences were surprisingly low key, very short lived, and often quite one-dimensional. Why this was the case? I don't know the answer, but I longed for a little more bite to help liven up the scenes and break up the mundane, text heavy dialogue. So, let's get that bite back please and add a little magic to the mix to get things stoked up again. 
The VERDICT:  Overall, Sicario is a solid installment in the Crime/Thriller genre. It continues the trend of focusing on the characters, trying to extend their lives and keep the program alive and relevant. Those looking for the realism and planning components to deceptive operations will absolutely love this movie and the layers that it has established. Yet, the movie still does not meet the speed requirements that the trailers established, nor the action components. It has the potential to set up for a great sequel, but you need to be ready for a more grounded movie to be entertained. Good for kids? Not at all, not only due to the darker themes, but the pacing is not going to work. Worth a trip to the theater? If you want a deeper, character centric plot yes, but wait for next week when a new round of blockbusters start. My scores are: Action/Crime/Drama: 7.5Movie Overall: 6.0",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
56,Easygoer10,Terrible,3,18 July 2019,"This is so bad, I couldnt watch t whole film. It really plays on fear mongering, & how ""drug trafficking is a war"" type issues. ""Matt Graver"", played by Josh Brolin, is perfect for this garbage. It is right in line with the ""Haters"" that Donald Trump and his right wing followers cultivate. The original film, ""Sicario"" (2015) was excellent; primarily because of the director, Denis Villeneuve. He is incredibly good. Although he has been making films for only about a decade or so, I have not seen any he made that are not superb. On the other hand, this film is woeful, and it has a much diffetent director, which really shows: In a bad way. It is a dumbed dowln version of any simple ""shoot-em-up"" joke. I look forward to anything Villeneuve makes, which is not this film.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
57,eric262003,Taylor Sheridan's Script Is the Difference Maker,8,22 January 2019,"Call me crazy, but I truly believe that screenwriter Taylor Sheridan may be the best screenwriter in the modern era. It was really awesome to see him return as the writer for the sequel of the 2015 action film ""Sicario"" in ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"". He was the main reason why last year I was pumped up to see this critically acclaimed movie and hopes if a third installment comes out in the future I'll surely look forward to it.That's not to say that all those who contributed were insignificant. Even though it was sad that Emily Blunt was missing in action, and the change of direction as Stefano Sollima replaced Denis Villeneuve and Icelandic composer Hildur Guonadottir replaces the late Johann Johansson plus Dariusz Wolski takes over from Roger Deakins as the cinematographer, they all pulled through in getting the story told very effectively. Sure it's still inferior to its predecessor, there is still a high level of action and suspense that's handled professionally.The story begins with a suicide bomber blows up a grocery store in Kansas City. This alarming moment sets up personal conflict as Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) hires CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to head over to the US/Mexico border where it is to believe that illegal immigrants are sending Islamic terrorist to the country where drug cartels are coming in. With illegals coming into the country by a staggering rate, Graver hires assassin Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) to declare war against these cartels.Their first initiative was to abduct the kingpin's daughter Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner) and to cause a bit a distraction which would be to their advantage. Vut like all good things that come to plan often result in ugly consequences.When watching this movie you can't ignore the actions of the movie without acknowledging the current events you hear on the news today about President Trump and his bid to protect the Americans from illegals coming into the country and the debate if whether building a wall is good idea or a bad one. And sure the issues are divided you also have to take into consideration of the innocent ones involved in this crisis. Think of the children and the traumatic effect it has on them knowing that they're being imprisoned and separated from their mothers and fathers we then ask ourselves where are our morals and how can we even them out?With the emphasis depending more towards people smuggling over trafficking we get a more deeper look at humanity to these issues knowing that we are not watching a feel-good movie here. Moral issues are put in question and since we don't have that shining light in Emily Blunt's role, we are at a real disadvantage regarding our actions.The cornerstone to the other film in compared with ""Soldado"" was that Blunt could trace the faults we as humans commit which felt like the predecessor can inject more empathy to the story which shows there could be more of a message of hope. Here they go by we to do everything in its delivery by saying there is no hope and that future is getting worse and that's there's no point in saving humanity as we are way beyond repair. Sure not all stories have that ""happily ever after"" mindset and that evil could prevail, but does it have to rubbed in our faces?The film isn't without its share of weaknesses. In the first installment, the subplots were well woven together which contributed to getting the story across by not leaving out making these subplot prominent issues to the main story. In ""Soldado"", we have a strong main story and all the other important subplots are just just reduced as nothing more than an afterthought. Like the kid who's inspired of becoming a hitman one day feels left out in the cold with lack of any further developing and gets forced by the time the film's ending.And though I praised these contributors for their efforts in making this movie, their predecessors absence can still be felt and dearly missed. And though Johansson will be sadly missed as least Guonadottir succeeded in capturing the dark tones like in the first installment. However director Sollima and cinematographer Wolski was not up to par with the brilliance of Villeneuve and Deakins which also lowers the dread and tension of the first movie.And though it was great to see Brolin and Del Toro back into their respected roles, they had to go more out of their way than before knowing too well that they depended on the more reliable crew members to get the story across on the technical side so Brolin and Del Toro had to step up ahead of themselves to get the story across. This makes these gentlemen the big men on campus.In addition to that, a very special nod goes out to the performance by Isabela Moner for her performance as Isabel Reyes. She showed she can handle herself well in from her previous outing in ""Transformers"". In some ways her traits match similar to those of Dafne Keen's performance from 2017's ""Logan"".Though it's still inferior to the original ""Sicario"" ""Sicrario: Day of the Soldado"" is still very intense and carries the dark tones of its predecessor very effectively. If these films churn out great expections, you can bet your bottom dollar there will be a third installment in the future.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

60,DJAkin,Hard to understand the plot,4,16 July 2018,"I went to this movie not knowing what to expect. The character played by Josh Brolin has perfect hair and is always completely composed. He is a no nonsense agent of some branch of the government. For some reason, he starts a war between two drug cartels in Mexico with the help of Benicio Tel Toro. I have no idea why they are doing this. During one scene, the Mexican police decide to shoot at Josh and his crew. So Josh kills all the police. Then when they get back to the office, the lady played by Catherine Keener yells at Josh for shooting all the police. She says that millions of Americans have family members in Mexico and now Fox News is going to run the story on the killings. Then Josh says that the president has no backbone and is a coward. Then Catherine Keener says that's because he's afraid of being impeached! They never mention Trump by name, but it was a bit tacky to insert partisan politics into the plot. I guess the good things about this movie are the action scenes. I also like Josh's acting. I will never understand this plot though. Very confusing. The ending clearly left it open for a third installment of the franchise. Overall a decent movie but not really that great.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
61,MR_Heraclius,Sicario,9,14 February 2020,"Okay, so this doesn't come close to the first movie in the series. But, it comes close enough to being close that it's much more than watchable. It's actually a very good movie. If it was a standalone movie and Sicario never happened, people would more appreciative. Del Toro is his usual badass self. The cartels and U.S. law enforcement are brutal, per the usual. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast action.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
62,michaeltrivedi,My Immediate Reaction was to give this a 10,8,15 October 2018,"Sicario, the first film, was great. This second film, I thought would not be a good follow-up. Primarily due to the main actress being absent, and the weird advertising campaigns and billboards.But it far exceeded my expectations. If you switched this film with the first, I would say they were both just as strong as each other, like Godfather 1 and 2. I really like drug cartel movies, and this one nailed it right on the head. If you want a great cinematic experience, go see this soon!",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
63,leftbanker-1,Day of the Soldado? More Like Day of the Babysitter,2,15 March 2020,"SPOILERS!The story starts out a bit farfetched, but somewhat coherent. Soon it heads south, and I don't mean down Mexico way, I mean south as in stupid. Like having a bad child actor take over the film stupid. Why would any director not out to make a children's film use children if it weren't completely and totally germane to the story? Answer: a bad director.As a matter of fact, it starts out pretty strong, except for the scene with the young girl at school. We definitely didn't need any character development on a character not worth developing.Then it goes to dumb.The whole storyline with the gangbanger kid was dumb. More kids? Ugh. The attack on the convoy was OK, but too much of the kid crying. Crying is never pleasant. It you absolutely must use it, use it sparingly. The kid is a terrible actress. So why does the director keep showing her, showing her sobbing?From dumb, to dumber.The girl escapes. Who cares? They did their job of first ""saving"" her and now they were attacked by the someone in Mexico. Go home and who cares about the girl? Someone else's problem. They are in the middle of the desert with no cover. How hard would it be to find a girl on foot? Not very, is my guess, yet the film takes a dogleg in this direction. She flags down the first vehicle to come by, jsut after her protectors with ambushed. She deserves to die. Obviously they had nowhere to go. Now it's adventures in babysitting. There is another hour to the movie and nothing else good happens.From this point the movie deserves 1 Star, only because that is the lowest the scale goes.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
64,Troy_Campbell,A riveting and challenging sequel.,9,1 July 2018,"2018 will henceforth be known as the Year of the Brolin. First was the indomitable Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, then the badass antihero Cable in Deadpool 2, and now Josh Brolin returns to his morally shady CIA operative Matt Graver in the follow-up to 2015 masterpiece Sicario. Continuing the war on drugs using any and all methods available, while smashing ethical and legal boundaries every step of the way, Graver and his team (including Benicio del Toro's scene-stealing hitman Alejandro) kidnap the daughter of a drug kingpin in the hope of starting a Cartel war. Less of a direct sequel and more of a new chapter with familiar faces, filmmaker Stefano Sollima and returning screenwriter Taylor Sheridan concoct a hard-hitting tale existing within the murky fog of war. Heroes and villains blur, good and bad weave in and out of each other, and right and wrong are concepts that simply add no value to understanding the dilemma. It's rare for a movie to be this intellectually and morally uncomfortable, but that's what makes it so damn riveting. Italian director Sollima steps into Denis Villenueve's shoes without missing a beat, allowing the dread to simmer underneath the surface and the tension to build to unbearable levels through meticulous pacing and unnervingly long shots. Yet when it explodes, it does so with gritty aplomb. The set pieces are crafted with a tough and uncompromising realism, the businesslike choreography and thundering sound design reminiscent of Michael Mann's classic Heat. Taking over from composer Johann Johannsson (who sadly passed away earlier this year), Hildur Guðnadóttir delivers an atmospheric score that not only supplements proceedings but imbues it with next-level suspense and heft. A powerhouse leading duo, expert direction and a provocatively complex narrative, Sicario: Day of the Soldado is an action-thriller firing on all cylinders.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
65,kevin c,bring back Blunt,6,18 November 2018,"Decent sequel and thriller, but no match for it's predecessor. And it's concerning that no moral judgment is made about the disturbing behaviour of the U.S military.The plot makes little sense, ISIS are linked to Mexican drug cartels. But i can't recall how/why? Some of the plot twists here are completely absurd. Men return miraculously from the dead after being shot at point blank.But it is tense and a well-made old-fashioned thriller.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
66,bettycjung,A decent sequel for the most part,7,2 July 2018,"7/1/18. Caught this in the theater only because it was scorching hot outside. Didn't expect too much since this sequel no longer had Emily Blunt in it. But, surprisingly enough it was a pretty good crime thriller about black ops hired to play off the Mexican cartels with one another to disrupt the transport of terrorists into the U.S. Of course, things would have to go awry, and better than most for this genre, it actually tackled the emotional repercussions of a mission gone wrong. The plot was easy enough the follow. The only hole was they never explained why that young hood in the making knew Del Toro's character. If they explained that it would have gotten an extra half star.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
67,rockman182,Sicario: Day of the Soldado (2018),7,2 July 2018,"For my money, Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors going today. Sicario was great, and still wasn't even one of his best films. I felt like most people when I heard about the film getting a sequel. I wondered if it was really necessary? Obviously, I decided to check it out (because when you have a MoviePass, why the hell not?) Sicario 2 is definitely a very solid film, it pales a bit in comparison to the first but for the most part is a competent effort.The film sees the return of Alejandro Gillick and Matt Graver, played by Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin respectively. The duo team up to take on the Mexican cartel, who are suspected of transporting Islamic terrorists to the states. The plan is a ruthless one that involves kidnapping the daughter of an established kingpin. The leads get involved in a battle around the border that becomes a tense battle of life and death. Interestingly, Emily Blunt does not return for this film.I'd like to compliment the score first and foremost. It is tense, nail biting, and foreboding. The cinematography is still very good, even if it doesn't include Roger Deakins from the first film. Brolin and especially del Toro are great in their roles and are a strong point as to why this sequel works. The film is a little looser and tamer in plot than the first but it still brings the gory violence and gun fights. Its still intense and is close to rivaling the first film in many regards.Is this sequel necessary? Not at all. Its a good film for sure (although the ending sequences leaves a lot more to be desired and not as strong as can be). However, it didn't need to be made and is obviously setting up for a trilogy which is even less needed. I'll still tune in for del Toro's Gillick. As stated earlier this is still a competently made film that is mostly satisfying. The film has a really terrible title name by the way, should have just stuck with Sicario: Soldado.7.5/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
68,RforFilm,"Without letting anything go, Sicario: Day of the Soldado continues it's dark vision of the Mexican cartels and the US response to them",7,6 July 2018,"A few years ago, Sicario was released and critically phrased. I had originally given the film a negative review for being unoriginal. I gave the film another chance beforehand and viewed it before the upcoming sequel. I can come to the conclusion that while I still find the subject very dull for my taste, Sicario is beautifully photographed, well acted, and put's you in a constant sense of dread. I can say that Sicario was clearly made to be so bleak and violent, it's to address the issues related to Mexico and the drug cartels...especially it's influence within the United States.What I also noticed a second time around was how much I enjoyed the characters of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro. They all had different viewpoints of how the violence of the cartels need to be responded. Blunt wanted to simply go after those hurt in the beginning. Brolin saw anything cartel-related coming into the US needed to be dealt with much retaliation, no matter the lives at stake. Del Toro, is the deepest, having been a part of the Colombian cartel, and thus has no morals for any side. The stories of the characters continue in Sicario: Day of the Soldado. Terrorists go through a suicide bombing in Kansas City, killing fifteen people in a groceries store. This gives the government leverage to allow permission for the CIA to retaliate the Mexican drug cartels who are have said to smuggled the Islamic terrorists in. Special officer Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) decides the best option would be to get a war going between the major cartels. To pull this off, he recruits black operative Alejandro Gillick (played by Benicio del Toro) to develop a plan. They put their plan into motion in which they plan on kidnapping the daughter of a kingpin, with the goal of pinning it on their rival, hoping to set off a war. After a chase, with masks concealing their identity, they kidnap teenage Isabela (played by Isabela Moner). They bring her back to the US, with plans to return her in rival territory. While that goes fine, not only does something go wrong with the local police, but new evidence is brought forward, not only putting her life in jeopardy, but that of Alejandro who is also with her.Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a lot like the first movie. Despite the original director Denis Villeneuve not returning, Stefano Sollima does a great job not only duplicating that same cinematography that I enjoyed, but creates that same gloomy tone from before. This allows it's story to build the cartels as more dangerous enemies given their possible ability to smuggle terrorists into the US. This also builds a similar tone that, could still be seen as quite dull. While it does for me, it's more of a story issue, which I'll get to in a moment. Let's talk about the characters.Like from before, both Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro are entertaining actors that know how to add their personalities into these characters. Brolin has the rough look that implies he's seen action, but confidant enough that you could trust him...even when things are questionable. Del Toro might actually seem more mysterious this time, given how he's even brought into action (which I won't spoil) and what exactly happens to him towards the end (which I also won't spoil). Because neither of these characters could be defined as ""good"", your in a constant state where you want to see justice for what happens, your not sure is any of these characters have the right response or justification for these actions. I guess it's a part of the movie's deeper insight in American CIA involvement.Now what about that story? Much of the goal is easy to understand, with the hope that both cartels will eliminate each other through future war. There is a B story involving a Hispanic boy in the US and his part of a cartel. I could understand a lot of people taking offense to this kind of portrayal. I want people to understand that it doesn't seem to be saying anything about an entire country or a group of people, but rather of darker events that I could see happening in this circumstance. Both stories to coincide towards the final act, which I'll admit I was starting to get board of towards the end. I think they could have shaved off fifteen minutes rather then dragging things out.I'll give this seven Mexican flags out of ten. Most fans of the first movie should enjoy Sicario: Day of the Soldado. People coming in by now should know that these movies can be hard to sit through, but that's the whole point; to reveal how dark people are willing to go to make peace.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The war on drugs has worsened on the America-Mexico border. Apart from drugs, cartels are smuggling terrorists from Mexico, into the US. FBI agent Matt Graver(Josh Brolin) once again joins forces with hitman Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro), to take the fight to the cartels. Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a great film. Director Stefano Sollima maintains the dark, action-packed & tense environment that Sicario(2015) mastered. However, director Denis Villeneuve's 2015 directorial is better. Emily Blunt's character from Sicario(2015) is definitely missed. The ending is a bit of a let down, compared to the rest of the movie. The action set pieces are fantastic. The performances are the highlight of the film. Benicio Del Toro is spectacular as Alejandro. Del Toro continues to play his enigmatic character to perfection. Josh Brolin is outstanding as Matt Graver. Brolin is unstoppable this year, after standout performances in Avengers: Infinity War(2018), Deadpool 2(2018) & this movie. Isabela Moner is the star of the show as Isabel Reyes. Moner's exceptional acting abilities, solidifies that she has a bright future ahead of her.

71,markthomassintek,Doesn't live up to the hype,6,9 July 2018,"REVIEW - SICARIO DAY OF THE SOLDADOI said in my review for the first Sicario film that I wouldn't review the sequel, but as you can see from this I am, why? Well my biggest gripe with the previous film was the female FBI agent who was worthless to the story and detracted from what was actually happening. So I read the synopsis for this sequel and thought I'd give it a try. With Trumps recent zero tolerance on Mexicans crossing the border and as we have seen families being split up this film couldn't have been released at a more relevant time. But as with the first Sicario film and with the trailers being shown I thought this would start the war as mentioned early in the film between the USA and the cartels, but the reaction to events in the film just didn't sit right with me, can't give anything away as I don't post spoilers. But as with the first film the story follows one individual and the proper underlying story gets lost behind the 16 year old girl. OK, go and see and enjoy but for me personally didn't live up to the hype and got lost up its own morals. Rating 6 out of 10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The sequel,Sicario:Day Of The Soldado strove for the same result but seems to come up just a little short. That's not to say this film isn't very brutal or grounded but it just seems to lack the intensity of the first. However, despite having a different director and cinematographer, the picture does retain the same style of the first. In the way it looks and is shot.Unsurprisingly it doesn't live up to the previous installment but Sicario:Day Of The Soldado does posses much of the others appeal.

Shame that no one important ended up dying.And what the hell was that ending about? Are they trying to set us up for another sequel?

74,kuarinofu,Disconnected,6,13 October 2018,"This was a good movie and I enjoyed watching 90% of it. It has, however, a couple of problems that prevent me from ranking it with a good amount of stars.
First of all, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. Second, it is focused mainly on one operation and its details yet it gives a lot of pre-story and overcomplicates it. This makes you feel like you're watching one movie morphing slowly into another one. Thirdly, it has a lot of characters, some of those are important to the story yet they recieve so little time you wonder why were they even there in the first place. And finally, the movie didn't quite deliver the ending I was hoping for. Some heavy stuff I won't spoil happens closer to the end, yet the ending itself was quite unsatisfactory for me.
I enjoyed this movie anyway, but I really wish it was more focused and had a more satisfactory ending.
I guess I have to re-watch the first one now to see how that one holds up.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
75,AhmedSpielberg99,Fine..... And That's Quite Disappointing!,6,24 September 2018,"Villeneuve's Sicario - half of its intensity - half of its tension - half of its emotional intelligence - half of its beautiful atmospheric cinematography - its skillful editing - its masterful buildup, hence almost all of its surprise factor - Emily Blunt + terrific performances from the entire cast + an even better performance from Josh Brolin + a quite interesting subplot + keeping its moral within its story, and therefore avoiding preaching = Sicario: Day of the Soldado!Which means it's an OK movie!Because...........It still well-paced, has a solid and tight narrative structure, cool camera movements, exquisite use of light, and some truly powerful moments.Unfortunately, it is for sure disappointing compared to the original. But what disappointed me the most is that we didn't get the action dose the final trailer promised us, which could have elevated the movie a little and made it more gripping and less boring as the story itself is somewhat familiar, way less captivating, and, definitely doesn't feel original. Plus, there are some very silly and dumb moments.Also, the dialogue is uneven; there are some really smart and clever lines, but also there are some very clichéd ones that sometimes don't even fit with the situations they are said in.I mentioned the great performances from the entire cast as a plus because in this movie the actors who play less-important roles are exceptionally good! Maybe because the side characters they play are well-utilized and well-balanced with the main plot. But by saying all the secondary actors are great, I mean every single actor who appeared in two, or even one single scene!
By the way, both Elijah Rodriguez and Isabela Moner are very talented young actors.+ Benicio Del Toro's creepy gaze!

76,brankovranjkovic,Sicario 2,8,1 July 2018,"Action packed, brutal, violent drama.A tense, gritty sequel to the brilliant first film with a strong haunting 'jaws like' soundtrack.The first film focuses on drugs, this instalment concerns how the Mexican cartels are trafficking people across the U.S. border. The U.S. Government decide to stage the kidnapping of the daughter of a Mexican Cartel kingpin in order to spark a war between the major cartels.The first ¾ is a well-crafted film, the remaining is ludicrous. It seems to me that a Hollywood executive probably got involved and insisted on how it should end and ultimately the abrupt end sets up for a third film. Sequels hardly ever measure up to the original and so this instalment also falls a little short, though not as strong as the first, this is still a very good film.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

For me it has improved,6,2 December 2018,"La primera no me gusto, sin embargo esta si me ha gustado, me ha entretenido, aunque no sea más que una película que la ves y poco más. Es demasiado oscura, hasta el punto de que a veces no ves nada. Pero la ves y con el metraje que tiene no es larga.No me gusta como está rodada. Parece mentira que con los presupuestos que tienen no se preocupen de hacer buenos planos, solo de que todo quede rodado.Los actores están bien, no se les puede pedir más. Es para lo que da.La iluminación me parece demasiado oscura. Estamos de acuerdo que es de noche, que quiere hacerla oscura, pero es que no llegas a ver lo que pasa en la pantalla. A veces tenía que fijarme mucho.El director, al menos consigue no aburrirme. Me entretiene. No rueda de manera magistral, pero al menos no rueda a base de montaje. Tiene ritmo la película y consigue hacer una segunda parte que no se cae.Para verla un sábado noche, no esta mal.The first one I did not like, but this one, if I liked it, has entertained me, even if it's just a movie that you see and little else. It is too dark, to the point that sometimes you do not see anything. But you see it and with the footage it has is not long.I do not like how it's shot. It seems incredible that with the budgets that they have, they do not worry about making good plans, just that everything is shot.The actors are fine, you can not ask them anymore. It is for what it gives.The lighting seems too dark. We agree that it is night, that you want to make it dark, but you do not get to see what happens on the screen. Sometimes I had to notice a lot.The director, at least manages not to bore me. It entertains me It does not roll masterfully, but at least it does not roll based on assembly. The movie has a rhythm and he manages to make a second part that does not fall.To see her on a Saturday night, it's not bad",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
79,eva3si0n,2 part have turned out absolutely another,7,24 January 2021,2 part have turned out absolutely another. This is the ordinary fighter about fight of the Mexican cartels.

80,Alexander_Blanchett,Its a fine sequel but flawed,7,28 December 2018,"The film had a good start and a promising plot but not all of that potential was used to fill out the entire film. I think the prime problem was for writer Taylor Sheridan to fit the character Alejandro into the plot and giving him a more central role than in the first one. The result was that in the last third it felt like they didn't know what to do with the character anymore and it all became a bit cheesy and over the place.
The quality of the performances doesnt suffer from that at all. Benicio Del Toro is once again great in the role of Alejandro. Josh Brolin shines here even more than in the first one and gives very nuanced and great performance. That guy truely had a fantastic year. The girl is good as well. Catherine Keener was sadly but expectedly wasted.Her character was rather useless too in many aspects. Its really a shame she only gets those third grade roles anymore.
The cinematography offers again a great visuality and some very beautifully composed pictures. The score is similiar to the now ""legendary"" score of Johann Johannson and feels like an homage to the late composer. Sadly you see that Denis Villeneuve is not helming the film but Stefano Sollima, whose direction I blame for some of the films few flaws. Generally however a good thriller that probably would have worked better as a stand alone film.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

83,garethcrook,Shallow & Clunky,6,2 September 2019,"I really liked Sicario and I really dislike sequels, so this was risky. The first film was stealthy and weighted toward its characters, their politics and felt well rooted. This one feels a little more shallow, clunky. Del Toro remains all suave-laced danger and Brolin does the grizzled hardman effortlessly, but the cast around them are dull stereotypes, plodding through a somewhat hackneyed plot. All that said, it is slick. Drug cartels, morally bankrupt Mexicans verses morally pious Americans. Terrorism, kidnappings, all bathed in either a dark washed out grade or a dusty burnt out desert-scape, military vehicles swarming with men dressed in black fatigues. The intelligence though is compelling, war games, counter information, objectives switching in a murky world, it tries desperately to keep you on your feet, whilst trying to convince you of a sentimentality in Del Toro's motives that are loose at best. It's a bit predictable and seems to suffer the lack of female lead. Emily Blunt gave the first film structure and that absence leaves this a testosterone heavy hot mess, all blanketed in a thick turgid score that would make even the most smash and grab action director blush. That's what this is, a blockbuster mentality, attempting and failing at delivering on a serious topic. Some risks don't pay off.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
84,statuskuo,Protect The Border,8,1 July 2018,"If there is anything to be learned from this movie, even drug cartels live with consequences.
The set up is simple, get one slimy cartel mule to fight the other one in hopes of stopping terrorism, since that is the new commodity. Cocaine isn't the crop it use to be. But scaring America is. And so caught up in the crossfire are personal attachments. Specifically, the ruse to kidnap the precocious self sufficient daughter of the one person who've changed the course of one hitman's life.
Yes, bodies pile up. And they are very dismissive of the value of 3rd world life. But that's the grim cruel reality. Except when our lead Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro has to face. What's at stake isn't America, though that's for you to decide. It's really about how, at the ground level, the bureaucrats will continue to see saw as the winds change. There is no steady ground. Which makes it solid. Looking forward to the third installment.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
85,saadanathan,Good but a bit complex 7/10,7,16 May 2020,"I wished it would have been Denis Villeneuve who directed the film. No offense to Stefano Sollima but Villeneuve created the whole idea of ""Sicario"" so I would have wanted to see his version of the sequel. Although it was fine and had great moments, visual effects, cinematography and score. The film is just a bit complex or maybe just too much. A lot of plot holes and moments I felt needed answers, to focus more on them. I felt like there was no explanation to what was going on: first you had terrorists in the U.S and then a military operation going wrong, you have the girl who is a witness and in the center of everything, to me it's too much, you have a side story of a kid who wants to be part of the cartels and his story is not developed or good enough. The whole side story could have been cut off. The part where Alejandro (Del Toro) and Isabel (Merced) get caught by the cartel was not my favorite part of the film, I didn't like it and would have cut it off the movie. Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are good as always, Isabela merced is gorgeous (I hope to meet her one day).

As always, Del Toro delivers what we have come to expect of him. Brolin was also good. There were some other characters who were just OK. The story was not well written. And the direction from the neophyte director showed alot. The studio seriously miscalculated when they replaced Villaneuve, probably to save a few million. So, what did they get? A disjointed story, and somewhat incoherent plot line, and one of the worst endings I have seen in years. All of the wind got completely sucked out of this film, with this haphazard, poorly written, terribly conceived piece of crap ending. Do not waste your time.I should clarify by saying I was a huge fan of the original. And I did not expect a film nearly as good. What I did not expect was a load of garbage, that felt like it had been rushed out by the studio. Hollywood is really losing it's edge.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
90,sweidman-28016,Underrated Series,7,28 October 2018,"Sicario: Day of the Soldado Review:Sicario: Day of the Soldado is the second entry in the Sicario series. I really enjoyed the first one and was excited for this one. I didn't think it needed to be made at first and thought it may not be as good, but I did enjoy it. I did like Sicario a little bit more however. The plot for this one was interesting and had my attention the whole time. They did some new stuff from the first one and it was interesting to see what was going to happen next. Like the first film, Benicio Del Toro stole the show. He does such an amazing job as Alejandro. Josh Brolin as Matt once again did well. There were two new faces that I thought were a great addition. Isabela Moner and Elijah Rodriguez we're very good, especially Isabela. I don't want to give out much about the plot since it was engaging and something new. The cinematography was good again, but probably won't get an Oscar nomination like it's predecessor. The sound editing was good and could possibly achieve getting a nomination. The score was one of my main concerns. Johann Johansson, a very good composer who did the score for the first one and even was nominated for it, had died in February this year. The score was good and contained elements from Sicario, though Johansson's will always be better in my opinion. There was a part in the middle that slowed down which I expected to happen with what was happening. It was very interesting for the most part of the movie but wasn't as engaging as the first like I wanted it to. Also something that just bothered me was the title was never really explained and once I learned what it meant, I felt it really didn't fit it as well. Other than that I did enjoy Day of the Soldado and I am excited for the next entries.My Grade: B+",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

93,MovieCriticOnline,Not as good as the first one,6,20 March 2021,"The good thing about this one that Emily Blunt's character was not in it to annoy everyone. The bad thing was that Roger Deakins wasn't there to continue the amazing look and feel of the first one. What a difference a great cinematographer makes. It was literally night and day.This one was too derivative of the first. There were identical shots. If you make a sequel you need to up the ante like with other great sequels. For example, Aliens, Empire Strikes Back Godfather 2, Mad Max, Terminator 2, The Dark Knight, to mention a few. This was a step-down. It wasn't terrible but you could tell a difference in terms of quality.Bruno Bichir was one of the best things in the film. Amazing actor.So much made no sense whatsoever. The US Government (Sec of defense) agrees to get dirty and as soon as it did, he bailed out. You can't tell me they are that ignorant because I don't believe it. Like they don't know how corrupt the Mexican Gov is and how Mexican police are on the payroll of the cartel. Somehow that was a surprise to them? Didn't buy it.There were some good scenes, and it's worth watching. After seeing it 3 times now I am unlikely to watch it a lot more times.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
94,donaldricco,10 Star poster!,7,15 October 2018,"It's hard to review this, because I liked the first one so much, and this movie is clearly inferior to that one. That being said, this is not a bad movie, not at all. It's missing the consciousness that Emily Blunt's character brought to the first movie, and there is way too much of the little girl in this one, but on it's own, this is a decent film. My biggest problem is in the way that it was marketed. It seemed like Benicio Del Toro's character was going to be ""turned loose"" in this, and even Josh Brolin's character says so in the film, but that is not the case, not at all. It's mostly a movie about smuggling, people this time, not drugs, and the cartels' role in it. No crazy sicario, no outrageous gunfights or assassinations. It's not the first time a studio has tricked me, but it still sucks.
But the movie? The movie is good. Dude, you got Del Toro and Brolin. What else do ya' need?",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
95,nikola17,Better Sequel and It's Worth it of Edge of Your Seat,10,30 June 2018,"LOVED FIRST Denis Villeneuve SICARIO (2015) TO DEATH it was entering, the Suspense of movie it builds up just like with this movie, i saw first Sicario in theater back 2015 very Interesting movie and to this sequel i never knew it would be franchise now it is and it's so worth it for your money to go to theater and watch movie it's better sequel, the reason why because i am more of action fan but this has a lot action and drama and mystery, thank god it wasn't lazy ruined sequel that's what everyone thought about it, it wasn't worst sequel it was great sequel just like with first movie. i understand it doesn't involve Emily Blunt, but doesn't mean movie is not same without her she nailed her performance in Sicario (2015) Not Just Her who was great Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin was great in first movie, Then In Sequel It's Great To Have These 2 guys kicking ass 2 guys who played in marvel movies like everyone is Saying Collector teaming up Cable or Teaming up Thanos Because Brolin Played 2 marvel movies. Josh Brolin had a hell of year to play 3 release movies like Avengers Infinity War and Deadpool 2 but this isn't marvel he had one hell of year with these 3 movies. now this is kinda of stand alone sequel but with same actors in movie but with different plot and it doesn't explain nothing about Emily Blunt Character, but relax people her character is not killed off. and writer Taylor Sheridan Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River. the all plot was about The drug war on the U.S.-Mexico border has escalated as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists across the US border. and it suicide bombers are bombing random places and killing random people then i have no idea why did Cartels let Terrorist in Mexico in, movie was filmed after Donald Trump Wall was Build, that's was not reason but it's movie in real life the wall was built so cartel, they got to country buy boat or ship whatever, To fight the war, federal agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) re-teams with the mercurial badass Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). it was badass i loved these 2 characters in movie their performance was SO watchable it was great i thought they need a Oscar for movie, love to see that Benicio and josh were 2 great lead actors and how they acted god it was brilliant, i loved how Matt is Interrogating Terrorist guy not hurting him but made him to watch computer screen Matt Fires Air Strike kills his family and house i was like WOW that is most painful thing to watch but i had no feelings because hey the guy is a Terrorist why does everyone has feelings for guy. Josh Brolin has played a very good and stunning character for Matt Graver. We can feel the aura of terror, firmness and professionalism from Matt just by looking at body language don't watch official trailers because that's how all scenes of movie is taken away and spoil movie that's why i never watched official trailer i watch small teaser of it. and Matt meets up Alejandro he gives him mission but without rules so they can do whatever they want without rules to fight against cartel and boss, after they kidnapped young little girl Isabel Reyes (Isabel Moner) she was from Transformers Last Knight she is a daughter to cartel boss, after of all it kinda reminds me of scenes of movie where it was filmed in Deseret in Mexico and Alejandro has to product Isabel kinda reminds me of Logan a bit but expect they aren't mutants. The battle scenes between the military under Josh Brolin's leadership with the cartel members and with the evil Mexican police have been shown to be very realistic, cruel and frightening. Every splash of blood is seen as a cruelty on one side, but on the other hand satisfying and the death of a human really feels like a death that gives a sense of fear. a lot of Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin were in action together was so great to have in action together very high body count, and yes Music Score film by Jóhann Jóhannsson rest in peace sadly didn't see this amazing sequel. it's slaright Forward pace is a lot faster it doesn't feel like it's LONG movie just like with first Sicario this was a lot entering is because of Action and it's Intense and makes you to keep watching and watching and action is very enjoyable i wish action scene with Josh Brolin when he was in car firing with machine gun shooting at Mexican polices officers i wish it was a longer Scene because he just shoots car like second then he gets back in i am like there's couple cop cars shoot them make action scene a lot longer and body count was great, story does focus a lot of characters one and one of another just like first film. Cynthia Foards (Catherine Keener) actress from The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Get Out i hated that movie oh that movie gets Award for their best performance what about this movie ??? this had a lot great Performance a lot of Suspense in it but no GET OUT aka Get out of my face gets award this movie really needs Award for Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin for it, now Catherine Keener is their her acting was good, she wasn't pain in ass or anything like that but she was not in movie that much but doesn't mean movie can't win any award. If you are a fan of Taylor Sheridan and have seen his other films (Hell or High Water, Wind River) then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. If you liked those films then you will surely like this film - of course, if you weren't fans of those films than don't expect anything different here! or Emily blunt and Denis Villeneuve were not part of project i am like so what ? doesn't destroy this movie, it makes it different and good and better that's why it's not ruined at all you will expect a lot things in this movie there's noting to say about i don't expect anything in movie there's a lot of things you will expect for this movie when you watch Sequel. I never feel bored. The acting, of course, is is Great. Benicio and Brolin are absolutely perfect bringing their characters to life. i thought Emily Blunt was not annoying in movie in my opinion she has great performance in movie she was not b*tch or anything like that people say that but i don't find Emily Blunt's character to be annoying at all. The bottom line is that this film is definitely worth paying the money to see in the theater it will be edge of your seats. when the movie was released and decided to watch Sicario to get a better sense of the situation. The new 'Sicario day of the Soldado, title is great before in 1st trailer it said Sicario 2 Soldado then in march they changed title Day of Soldado it's GREAT, Josh Brolin's appearance. He really makes himself look very tough and ready to avenge the terrorist cruelty in a way that will satisfy us. would i say it's his best character then to Deadpool 2 or Avengers Infinity War ? nah this is his best character in this movie. Benicio Del Toro has also given the impression of revenge that is so scary that we can feel that the retaliation will be very appropriate with the cruelty of the terrorists themselves just like first movie but different In movies like Rambo 4 (2008), Savages, Traffic, Netflix Narcos TV show mixed with that but with Action and Thriller and Mystery made we see that the bullets and deaths of someone, especially the evil one, But in movies like Sicario. the bullets and deaths of someone, especially the evil one, seem so easy and cheap like Terrorist you wanna hate them so badly, it's so watchable, thrilling, intense to start to end of movie keeps you thinking and thinking and watching it, keeps you Interested SO highly Recommended sequel you don't have to love first movie to death or have to see first movie this is like stand alone sequel but with these 2 guys and team of crouse director did a really good job he hasn't made many movies or shows but he made this sequel Perfect how everyone want it how i want it director Stefano Sollima directed

But soon the government changes its mind and orders clean up of the situation. ""Day of the Soldado"" (soldado is Spanish for soldier) isn't so much a sequel as a entirely new cycle of ""Sicario"" movies, centered on the characters of the 2015 film minus Emily Blunt. As far as this film is concerned, it just doesn't have the same impact as its predecessor. It has some really great moments, but it's a bit sluggish at time as it fails to land that jarring punch of 1st part. All in all, Sicario 2 is something of a mixed bag that thanks to its sharp action and nerve-jangling tension, particularly in the first hour, as well as Brolin and Del Toro's charisma. Should the producers decide to make another, I hope that they have a better script and perhaps a better director. I did like S.Sollima's work, but D.Villeneuve is a tough act to follow.

98,david-meldrum,Not So Much Bad As It Is A Let Down,6,10 June 2019,"The first Sicario was a brilliant, dark and morally complex which featured a couple of the best set pieces I've ever seen. Alongside the other two films which make up the thematic 'Border Trilogy' (Hell or High Water, Wind River), they present a set of films that say much about modern America and much about the borders we all draw in attempts to keep ourselves morally clean. So it's interesting to ask why Sicario got a sequel; the story didn't need one, and while this does fit in the border themes of the trilogy and shares Benicio Del Toro with the first film, there seems little purpose to it. There are elements to admire - some staggering ser pieces (especially the one n the supermarket near the beginning), some haunting images, a growing sense of dread. But it's undermined by a plot that's bizarrely incoherent in comparison to the tight and well-organised narratives of the other three films, and by the time one particularly absurd 'twist' happened as the film moved towards an ending, my wife and I both laughed out loud, puncturing the tone completely. There's lip service given to the moral complexity that ennobles the other films, but it's only lip service.

102,W011y4m5,*Inhales*,3,26 March 2019,"Going from Denis Villeneuve's Sicario to Sicario 2: Day of Soldado is one of the biggest downgrades in cinema history... What laughable sequel.
There are noticeable decreases in the quality of directing, cinematography, score, performances, writing; the 1st was a masterfully crafted, beautifully shot, tense, contemplative, morally ambiguous thriller that explored themes regarding the loss of innocence & the lack of humanity when tackling a very human problem taking place across the US / Mexican border. On the other hand, this is an uninspired, inconsistent mess which offers nothing new of any value besides mindless violence. Honestly, it's like following up a gourmet meal with a tin of spam when its sell-by date has expired...
What were they actually thinking making this sequel? Nobody wanted it. Nobody needed it. What's worse is it actually detracts from the brilliance of the first one too. All of the subtleties are gone from the original - what made the first so fantastic has been stripped from the sequel & we're left with the crap bits... Even the action sequences are shoddily put together, by comparison. Everything the prior installment succeeded in, this fails. No tension. No suspense. No edge-of-your-seat sequences anymore.

Then again, ""Soldado"" is far from what one would actually call a summer movie.I think the producers' decision of releasing it in the end of June, or middle of the major blockbuster season, was seeing it as an an antidote to the usual summer fare, and it has worked!If you just can't take another mainstream comedy, feature-length animation or something to do with superheroes, then ""Soldado"" might be just what the combat medic ordered.The movie's not so generic as to fit some general label - you might want to call it action, drama or thriller though - but it's captivating as hell if you like any of those three genres. But above all, it's well made in every way, gripping, and entertaining in some nihilistic sense.So many posh words so far, but not one about what it's actually about, eh? It's about war. The drug war on the U.S.-Mexico border (depicted at length in 2015's ""Sicario"") has escalated as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists into U.S. To fight it, federal agent Matt Graver re-teams with the mercurial Alejandro.Original's stars Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are back for the second helping, but this time the gloves are off and there's much less talk and much more action.This means that the audience has to also stomach a bigger amount of realistic bloodletting, which fills pretty much the whole story.What I really enjoy about ""Soldado"" is how realistic and to-the-point its story feels in every aspect. There's no way I can evaluate the actual level of realness compared to the U.S's actual covert war against cartels, but it sure does feel competent on the screen.The powerful laconic style preferred by director Stefano Sollima and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan works to a great effect. The central characters are all about business as they say, authentic warriors through and through.They don't glamorize war and suffering, they don't go on wasting bullets or words even to celebrate (small) victories because they know from experience how finite and fragile everything can be. They just go and do what's needed, and look supercool doing it. Especially Brolin who feels even manlier than usual.We don't even get to see the management side of the operations that much, which would only slow down and fragment the story, probably. This also saves the action-hungry part of the audience of the long-winding first half of the original ""Sicario"".All in all, witnessing the ""kitchen side"" of life of organized crime (and fighting that) hasn't felt that realistic and captivating since, well, the first three seasons of HBO's classic ""The Wire"".Of course, ""Soldado"" lasts only two hours, so they can't delve into the topic as deeply. But it really feels like experiencing this life first-hand. Well, without all the hardships such as getting killed, of course.Special shout-out should go to composer Hildur Guðnadóttir whose dark ominous music perfectly fits and compliments the overall atmosphere.""Soldado"" is by far the best movie of 2018 I've seen so far, and the rare quality sequel that takes all that's good about the original, and then elevates it to another level.Put shortly, I loved it. Please let there also be the third part of the proposed trilogy!",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
107,darkreignn,"Deep, dark, and layered",9,4 July 2018,"Let me tell you a little something about Benecio Del Toro and ""Sicario."" In the first film, he does something so dark, so cruel, and so evil that Satan himself would be taken aback. But what did we, as an audience, say when we saw what he did? ""God damn, that was most bad ass thing I've ever seen!"" Now get ready to say those exact words for the entire run time of ""Sicario 2: Day of the Soldado.""I mean, Christ Almighty, this film was amazing, truly. I was so engrossed in the film - the directing and cinematography were gorgeous and gritty and it drew me in and really made me feel like I was there. EXCEPT when a woman sat next to me and LITERALLY WOULD NOT stop talking to me the entire film. I was livid; my heart was pounding in rage. I really hate confrontation so I just sat there and took it like an adult film star. She made THE most idiotic comments I've ever heard. At one point she looked at me and said, ""God I'm so confused!"" and I wanted to cry because she then started to ask me questions about the plot and I just kept saying ""I don't know"" over and over and over again. At one point she left theater and I literally prayed to God, asking Him for her to please never come back in. Apparently either my prayer didn't work or God didn't hear me. But I digress, because even though this spawn of Hell sat there, verbally harassing me for 2 hours, I still loved this movie. From the start, when the camera doesn't shy away from a horrific and disturbing terrorist attack in a supermarket, you know you're in for something bleak. And bleak isn't even the right word, because from that point on, things just get worse and worse. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" isn't afraid to show the reality and brutality of modern day warfare and terrorism. A terrorist attack isn't something to make a Hollywood movie out of (cough Michael Bay cough), a terrorist attack is something nonsensical, something that can happen at any moment, at any time, any where, without warning, and for no reason. And that seems to be a recurring theme in the movie, because anytime violence is shown, it happens quickly, unexpectedly, with very little prior warning to those involved. And it's effective. One of my favorite sequences in this film involves a shootout on a dusty highway - I won't spoil much, but what I will say is that the scene does a brilliant job in showing the dichotomy of how different people view violence. The people doing the shooting, while at first surprised, are unphased when it comes to actually participating in the killing. They've done this before, and are shown to be efficient in their work. However, there is another person involved in this shootout who is not a fighter and the entire time they are screaming, crying, and covering their ears - they're hysterical, because such brutal violence, to them, has not yet been normalized. It is heartbreaking to watch, but it's mesmerizing as well, and it adds a layer of complexity to the film that I didn't expect. The film, with it's unflinching portrayal of atrocities, is really about the loss of innocence, and the way innocents are affected in warfare. When violence is depicted in this film, it isn't glamorized. It's dirty, it's bloody, and when it involves innocents, it's shown as terrifying for them to be involved in.I've read some reviews where this has been seen as a negative, and I can't help but wonder why? This kind of stuff really happens, so we shouldn't be afraid for it to be called to our attention. Is it pleasant to see innocent people, children specifically, affected my the violence of war and terrorism and government false flag events? No, it's actually awful to witness, but this stuff happens and it's important to be aware of it. Now before I start sounding like some crazed flat earther conspiracy theorist, let me continue to talk about exactly why 9/11 was an inside job. No I'm only joking (about me talking about it, not about 9/11 being an inside job) - what I really want to talk about is the amazing directing and cinematography. It seriously blew me away. It isn't as good as the first ""Sicario"" in terms of that, but it's so close. So many scenes had the opportunity to be filmed and executed in the laziest, most generic manner known to man, but every scene subverts expectations, not only in content, but also in the cinematography and direction. For example, in the shootout mentioned above, the majority of the time the camera stays focused on the person who is screaming and crying, bent down in a car, trying to shield themselves from the gunfire. The audience doesn't necessarily see all the carnage happening in the shootout - they can hear it, which is terrifying enough, and the decision to have the camera stay focused on the character who isn't used to this type of violence was masterful. Instead of witnessing a cathartic bloodbath like you would expect, you instead witness the loss of somebody's innocence. It's visceral, and it's intense, more intense than any action scene ever put to film because instead of simply showing people getting shot, you are forced to hear it and imagine it while the camera just stays focused on someone trapped in this chaos. Most action movies don't show you how scary violence is. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" does, and does so through it's incredible direction.God, I really cannot emphasize how amazing this film was. Oh wait, yes I can, I'll continue just for you. Another thing that made this movie incredible was how riveting and unpredictable the story was. Everything felt real. Sometimes things go wrong, sometimes things happen with no reason, sometimes people do things and you don't know why, and sometimes people change. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is not afraid to portray life at it's most realistic and unpredictable. It's not afraid to show that people, most of the time, act in their own self interest as long as they don't have to see the consequences of their actions. And it's not afraid to show how easily corruptible people are. This is a deep, layered, complex film with so much to pick apart and I'll have to stop now or else I'll get fired for writing this at work. ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is one of my favorite films of the year, and I'll definitely be going to see it again.9/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
108,asifahsankhan,A pointless but worthy franchise attempt,7,27 June 2018,"Francois Truffaut's assertion that there is ""no such thing as an anti-war film"" has been getting a lot of traction in recent years, and if you're inclined to agree with it, then I think it's safe to extend the statement to America's protracted, relentlessly immortalized war on drugs. I certainly had it in the back of my mind while watching the first Sicario, though Denis Villeneuve's oppressively bleak and plodding (in a good way, I'd say) handle on that film's action sequences do as much to deglamorize the business of DEA raids and cartel violence as I suppose one can. There is no up in these films, which is the main thing Stefano Sollima's sequel has in common with its predecessor; as the action fades, the players once again look around at each other, wondering what any of it was for.This is particularly emphasized in Soldado, which opens with the uncomfortably timely image of Mexican migrants crossing the Texas border and being surrounded by border patrol officers. (There are allusions to a POTUS with varying opinions on the goings-on south of the border, which convinces me more than ever that post-2016, you cannot refer to the American president without first assuring us which one you are referring to.) One of the migrants breaks off from the group, mutters an ""Allahu Akbar"" and blows himself up. Afterwards, we see a horrifying scene of a hardware store in Kansas City being attacked by suicide bombers, and the secretary of State (Matthew Modine) gives a televised statement punctuated with some boilerplate fighting words: ""Your bombs do not terrify us, they empower us."" Perhaps I come to these things with my own preoccupations, but I couldn't help but hear it as more of a statement about the American appetite for film violence than homeland security.So the lines are drawn; the already feared and hated Mexican cartel border traffickers are now a funnel for Middle Eastern terrorists as well, the nightmare of every xenophobe and hawk rolled into one conveniently missile-able target. Josh Brolin's Matt Graver is summoned for a black-ops mission to set off a cartel war, and he quickly reunites with Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro.) Their plan is to stage the kidnapping of a drug lord's teenage daughter (Isabela Moner) make it look like the work of a rival, and let the bullets fly. That it's these two jet-black cynics we're following, and that Emily Blunt's outsider FBI agent is nowhere to be found, tells you a little bit about what this movie's objective is: to fully wallow in its morass, unencumbered by character transformation. Or, as one character asks another incredulously as the scheme inevitably goes south, ""You believe change is the goal?"" Again, it seems to me that writer and Hollywood's Great Masculine Hope Taylor Sheridan, consciously or not, understands the wheel-circling nature of the kind of the-world-is-garbage pseudo-deep brutality fests he traffics in.And yet, there is something compelling about Soldado's violence, though it contains nothing so memory searing as its predecessor's most tense setpieces. (Few single scenes in recent years have sent me into such all-consuming panic as one between Blunt and Jon Bernthal in Villeneuve's film - you know the one). Del Toro peeling back his balaclava and waiting for his trembling henchman victim to put on his glasses so that he may see who's about to kill him are somewhat groan-y tough-guy ceremonial rites. But the way he pulls the trigger, with a two-handed flourish that I still can't decide is brutal or impossibly graceful, is unforgettable, almost hungry in its abandon. Later, in the film's desperate final minutes, he disposes of a car tailing him in such blunt fashion that I could do nothing but choke back a laugh, even as I covered my face. Sollima's greatest strength in these moments is his patience, iterative of Villeneuve's own, but with a slightly more humanistic touch. He often lets these moments play out in one take, as Dariusz Wolski's camera turns from side to side to take it all in, with a kind of unnerving passivity.The why of it all is baked into the very style of the movie, which makes sentimental beats with Moner's character feel all the more at odds with the larger project here. Similarly, when Matt is asked to make a personal sacrifice for the mission, it doesn't quite land with the gravity intended, because things like affection, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships are so low on Sheridan's priorities (and strengths as a writer). When Day of the Soldado truly wallows in violence, it does so exquisitely, with the kind of hopelessness that film violence, especially around this subject matter, should convey. But it also destabilizes any marketable attempts at heroism or character investment, which makes it a little bit of a hard world to build a franchise out of without seeming completely disingenuous. Day of the Soldado ends boldly staring its own pointlessness in the face. But it will still find a way to trick you into coming back for thirds, and that's ultimately what's more un-trustworthy than anything.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

I'm hoping that I was able to still capture the full experience and depth of the characters that director Stefano Sollima aimed to create. As always, I am impressed with Josh Brolins performance. I feel that he hasn't had an opportunity to truly show what he is capable of beyond his CGI Thanos performance, so I will be attending each film he is in until I see it.

It is however, a bit of a drag in the first and second act due to its low levels of narrative interest, but it ends up stating itself as a slow burn due to a mind-blowingly organized final act that had me on the edge of my seat.

113,Bertaut,"Not as good as the original, but not half bad at all",7,8 July 2018,"Sicario 2: Soldado (released in North America as Sicario: Day of the Soldado) is a sequel to Denis Villeneuve's Sicario (2015). And if ever a film didn't scream ""sequel"", it was that one. Apart from the fact that it was only a modest box-office hit (grossing $84.9 million against a $30 million budget, in an era when the only films that become franchises must gross $800 billion in the first five minutes of their release), the storyline was carried to a fairly natural conclusion - Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro), protected by his CIA handler Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), successfully manipulated naïve and idealistic CIRG officer Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) into helping him exact revenge for the murder of his wife and daughter at the hands of drug baron Fausto Alarcón (Julio Cesar Cedillo). The film concluded with Graver getting what he wanted, Gillick getting revenge, and Macer in possession of a more realistic, if bitter, understanding of how the US conducts its affairs in Mexico.A sequel felt wholly unnecessary. But a sequel is what we have. When a suicide bombing in Kansas kills fifteen people, the US government authorise Graver to adopt ""extreme measures"" to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Deciding to instigate a war between the two major cartels, Graver recruits Gillick to assassinate a high-profile lawyer for the Matamoros cartel while Graver and his team 'kidnap' Isabel Reyes (Isabela Merced), the daughter of the kingpin of Matamoros' rival. Taking her to Texas, Graver and Gillick then 'rescue' her in a false flag operation, making it appear she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. As they transport her back to Mexico, Gillick begins to bond with her. However, after they cross the border, the Mexican police escorts double-cross them, and Isabel flees into the desert, pursued by Gillick. Meanwhile, the US government determines that two of the suicide bombers from Kansas were domestic terrorists, and thus were not smuggled into the country. With this mind, to help quell tensions with Mexico, Secretary of Defense James RIley (Matthew Modine orders the CIA to abandon the mission, much to Garver's disgust.With the first film wrapping up so neatly, the announcement of a sequel seemed like a typical Hollywood cash grab, one which would most likely crap all over the legacy of the truly excellent original. However, as bits and pieces of info regarding the sequel began to filter through, it started to feel less and less like the usual Hollywood knock-off we're all used to seeing. For starters, Taylor Sheridan would return as sole-writer, in a script that would not go in what, for many, might seem the only real direction in which to take the story - Macer getting revenge for Graver and Gillick using her. Instead, Macer wouldn't even appear, as the script would instead focus on pseudo-antagonists Gillick and Graver. To this end, the only other actors who would also return would be Raoul Max Trujillo as Rafael, one of Gillick's contacts in Mexico, and Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Foraing, Graver's number two. The big concern for a lot of people, however, was who would replace the irritatingly talented Villeneuve in the director's chair. And so it was another welcome bit of news when the man chosen was Stefano Sollima, the Italian director of A.C.A.B. - All Cops Are Bastards (2012) and Suburra (2015), as well as most of the episodes in the first season of Gomorra: La serie (2014).Okay, so first things first. Soldado isn't a patch on Sicario. Not even close (and, needless to say, there's nothing here to come anywhere near that dinner table scene). And there are some problems which were largely absent first time around. For example, the narrative suffers slightly from the absence of Macer, not insofar as she herself is irreplaceable, but more in the sense that the audience no longer has a surrogate. Because we know who Graver and Gillick really are this time around, there is obviously no point in the film playing its cards close to its chest, and so it adapts a more balls-to-the-wall, damn-the-torpedoes approach. This renders the narrative more morally simplistic than the first film. In tandem with this, perhaps wisely, Sheridan has written Soldado as a more conventional action-thriller than Sicario, but this has the knock-on effect that when the bullets start flying, as they do on several occasions, all the political/moral back-and-forth is made to seem nothing more than the material that gets us from one shootout to the next. Additionally, there's an element of repetition, as Isabel is traded off from one group to the next, and one definitely gets a sense of déjà vu, as she becomes a metaphorical cog in the screenwriter's machinery. Also, although Solima's direction is good (with that resume, how could he not get the gritty tone right), it's not as sharp as Villeneuve's. Finally, and this is a small point, the title of the film translates as Hitman 2: Soldier (or Hitman: Day of the Soldier in North America). This makes not a lick of sense, and instead sounds like a 90s action movie starring Michael Dudikoff.However, for all that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The script is sharp, relevant (references to a spineless POTUS undermining intelligence operations will be sure to please at least half the audience), gruff, and cool. With the two Sicario films, Hell or High Water (2016), Wind River (2017), and Yellowstone (2018), Sheridan is fast becoming one of Hollywood's most accomplished writers. The film also stars two of the coolest men on the planet being masculine and suppressing their emotions. Del Toro never so much as even hints at cracking a smile, whilst Brolin has lost some of the sardonic dismissiveness he possessed in the first film, but none of the bluster or self-confidence. All things considered, for a film that never seemed to have any real reason to exist, this is a cracking piece of storytelling, and has me already looking forward to the next instalment.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

115,Lewis_Heather787,"Missing the magic of the first, however still really enjoyable!",7,7 July 2018,"This film almost has an impossible task in following in the footsteps of the first film that was critically loved, personally one of my favourites as well. However it seemingly tries to overcome this problem by having a story doesn't resemble the first film in anyway. The sequel, probably for the right reasons, decides to go in a completely different direction than the first film. The only thing connecting the two films together are two characters other than that they are completely different films. Yes I suppose its in the same setting and about the cartels but the feel of the film is completely different, there is no narrative tissue that has carried over from the first film. Not even a reference. Without key elements coming back for the sequel including Denis Villeneuve, Emily Blunt and Roger Deakins, will the film suffer from these losses. The short answer is yes this film does miss these three people in the their different roles. Firstly Stefano Sollima has done nothing wrong with this film at all, that not what I'm trying to say if anything he has tried to carry on the work left by Denis Villeneuve. Sollima's directing throughout is very reminiscent of the first film however it just lacks that...............Villeneuve touch, I cant explain what that is it just doesn't feel the same as the first film. The directing in this film is still good but not up to the standard of the first. That is also true for the cinematography, which seems to be a small issue, but when comparing this film to the first, Roger Deakins far exceeds this film.This review is starting to sound negative its not, I actually genuinely like the film a lot its just got the unfortunate task of it predecessors standard to compete with. The story of this film is completely different and refreshing, the first half of the film is really interesting angel to go down and is really entertaining, however the second half of the film it does get a little over the top. This is why this film feels less grounded because the story and what is happening on screen is a little far fetch, but still entertaining none the less. The performances again from Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro are really strong, showing their own individual character progression as well as the chemistry between the two of them. They work extremely affectively together as a team, however it was not meant to be. I liked the idea of them becoming almost enemies towards the end of the film, having them squaring off would have been a great emotional punch. It didn't go down that root, in the end its a satisfying end.Overall this film is 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 it is still a really good entry into this series of films, I do hope that there is a third in the pipeline from Taylor Sheridan who has written both. Not quite as good as the first film in key areas, doesn't have that special magic.....(which I can't describe) that the first film has.

117,Jared_Andrews,"Stellar Acting, Exciting Action, But Lacks Awareness",6,7 July 2018,"Sequels typically strive to go bigger and badder than the original. This sequel is no exception. This issue with attempting to up the ante is that it often causes sequels to lose sight of what made the original special. Again, this sequel is no exception.For some reason that I still don't understand, 'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' opens with coverage of Somali pirates, Mexican-United States border crossings, and graphic scenes of ISIS suicide bombers that will leave you unsettled for an uncomfortably long time. Government agents presume that all these terrorist efforts are connected. They're not.The film's inclusion of these scenes doesn't add layers to the complexity of anti-terrorist or anti-drug efforts (it's unclear if that was ever the intention). Instead, the scenes only serve to offer some of the BANG BANG moments that sequels seem to require.There's an emptiness, a pointlessness to the violence-that should be the point of the film. ""The war on drugs"" is a war without an opponent, and the U.S. is fighting an unwinnable fight. The violence only begets greater violence, one immoral acts leads to dozens more like it, and everyone becomes dirty in the end. This film has no heroes.I wish that's what this movie was about, but it misses the point. It lacks the perspective and awareness of the first 'Sicario' film. The action in this film is well shot and exciting, same as the first film, but all subtle yet crucial details that made the first film excellent are wrong in this one.The acting saves the movie from failure. Josh Brolin is excellent once again as the smirking tough guy government agent, and Benicio Del Toro is award-worthy as Alejandro, the sicario. Though he has taken frustrating character development leaps since the first film, Del Toro is nonetheless commanding, angry and tactful. Mercifully, he also provides a few drops of humanity into a movie in desperate need of some. Most actors lack the versatility to successfully transition between all these emotions. But this is Benicio Del Toro.If you're a huge fan of Del Toro, Brolin or this genre of film, consider seeing it in the theater.

121,loco_73,Yet another sequel...,6,5 July 2018,"""Sicario: Day Of The Soldado"" is yet another wholly unnecessary sequel. Whatever made the first movie special, the vision, thought and its execution are gone, replaced with a by-the-numbers action movie, that tries hard to mimic its original counterpart, to no avail. Gone is Denis Villeneuve's direction, Roger Deakins's breathtaking cinematography and Johan Johansson's unsettling score. Gone is Emily Blunt and her character, who in the first movie acted as an anchor to the story and a filter through whose eyes we saw the plot unfold. She also served as a contrast to Benicio Del Toro's character, the enigmatic Alejandro, as well as Josh Brolin's Matt Graver. Her absence is noticeable indeed.Stefano Solima is a competent director, and Taylor Sheridan (who wrote the first one) still manages to imbue some interesting, even timely ideas and commentary, in this sequel of sorts, but ends up falling short of his previous efforts. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are good enough in their roles, but much of the shine of the characters they play is gone. That is especially true for Del Toro's Alejandro, whose strength as a character came from the relative mystery surrounding him, the unease and tension he could create with only his look or silence, or as we find out at the end of the first movie, his utter ruthlessness and his single-minded focus on revenge. Not this time around. All of that is missing.What is even more disheartening is that while for the first two-thirds ""Sicario: Day Of The Soldado"" is fairly watchable, the last third feels out of step with the rest of the movie, while the ending seems really contrived and not befitting the tone established previously.The fact that this movie is also clearly meant as the set-up for at least another entry into this franchise-to-be, doesn't help and does not bode well for the future.6/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

I saw the low rating of 7.1 and it delayed me from watching it until I just read the first movies screenplay and watched it again. I thought it has to be difficult for these incredible creative minds to bot achieve what was captured in the first 2015.Sheridan is incredible and to expect duty from him is insane. This movie reminded me of a modern day THE PROFESSIONAL----almost. While that movie is a masterpiece, this one is a very great movie.Totally distinct from the first, I loved this story even more but thats because Del Toro was captured flawlessly in the original. Here we see him humanized in an inhuman world. The sign language was a genuis to include part of his character. Beautiful. Del Toro is my personal favorite actor because he completely sheds his identity and embodies EVERY character he plays. This story is less convoluted imo than the first, though I loved it, and begs for a third installment like Sheridan naturally planned to have. It may not have very good reviews here, but its box office numbers didnt fair as bad. 32 in the first five days competing with mission impossible.I hope Sony greenlights a third very soon! Excellent movie and Josh Brolin delivered big time at the end",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
124,n-kefala,Del Toro at his bests,5,1 July 2018,"""Soldado"" explores the devastating toll of terrorism and drug-trafficking on the children caught in the crossfire. There are moments that are quite tense, but as a whole, ideologically, I don't know what this movie is trying to say. Where its predecessor, 2015's ""Sicario"" was thoughtful and interesting, this sequel is mean-spirited. Benicio Del Toro is giving an outstanding performance with the same intensity as his Oscar-winning performance in ""Traffic"". I must admit, Del Toro is so good he almost makes the film worth seeing. A fair amount of effort went into this production, but the results are simply unsatisfying.
The movie is confusing and the script is not so strong. It is more complex than the first.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
125,adrian-43767,"Not as good as the original SICARIO, but very good all the same",8,29 June 2018,"I found the original SICARIO (US 2015, directed by Dennis Villeneuve) one of the best films I have ever watched, one of the rare films made in this millennium that I would put on a par with the classics.SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO is, like most sequels, not as good, but it has some merits nonetheless. The acting by the two leads, Del Toro and Brolin, is first class, although this time Matt Graver (Brolin) comes across as more brawn and less of the subtle and even sardonic brain that he was in the first film. I missed an adult woman in a central role. Teenager Isabela Moner does her part well, but in a world of death, drugs and general depravity, a woman of Emily Blunt's presence would have helped.I also liked Matthew Modine, who I had not seen on the screen for some time. He plays a ruthless but stylish and authoritative secretary of state.Sollima appears to be a promising director, but he is not yet at Villeneuve's level, and a number of weaknesses become apparent during the movie, not least because the screenplay is not as tight and credible this time. For instance, the movie opens with an Islamic State member committing suicide, and I thought, wow, here is an interesting connection: Islam radicals and cartels. Alas, after a brief interrogation scene with Brolin sounding menacing and fulfilling his threats, the Islam element disappears from the movie and we are back in Mexico and cartel territory... and, to me, the movie steadily loses quality and gains predictability thereafter.The action scenes are very good, though I found Del Toro's survival surreal in every respect. Cinematography excellent. Again, screenplay is the weak link, with an open ending that inevitably opens the door to SICARIO 3.The first film suggested the darker workings of state in its war against threats posed by drug cartels. SOLDADO also suggests it in the interrogation scene and in the way that state sees human life as expendable, but it is less subtly presented.10/10 to the original, 8/10 to this one.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The Action Scenes were great and some nice twists.My guess is that the reason it didn't score well with the Critics is because it is not Politically Correct, like it highlighted too much the corruption within the Mexican Police and the illegal Border Crossing controlled by the Cartel.So ignore the Liberal Critics, this is a great Film to watch and enjoy.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

You are better off literally doing anything else because this one fails to entertain. There is no thinking involved, its just action scene after action scene and there is no comedy to keep anyone interested. It was like watching a lifeless photo reel of events. Not sure why they made it into a movie. Starts as a political mission and ends as a quasi-rescue except that no one needed a rescue to begin with (not really). Does nothing new and fails to pull the viewer in due to poor character building and generic bullet fights where the good guys are impossible to hit never mind kill. You think you have a open shot at their head from 3 feet away? Think again because even if you hit them, it will simply hit a non-vital part of the face... yep, its that silly.

Either make it s dramatic thriller like the first one, or make it straight up action like the last 30 minutes of this film. This movie is a mix bag, with scenes that are supposed to be dramatic but it just doesn't work. The action is the best part of this film, and there are more action scenes than the first one, which was boring due to Emily Blunt's character.The violent action is the best part of this movie, and it should be the main focused on the 3rd one. We don't need another movie about ""morals"" and ""ethics"" because it just is silly when put in context with the action parts of this movie.This movie has a great intro, with a cool 10 minute shootout in the middle, followed by an intense finale.

The main three actors-Brolin, del Toro, and the young woman-are very good, especially the young woman. She actually sort of steals the film from the other two. Sets up a third film nicely, but overall it just lacks the connectivity with the audience from the first film. It might make you wonder if half the film got left on the cutting room floor, because the depth just is not there, either. All in all, it's still good, but it could have been better.

The main problem here then is the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, which is surprising due to his previous outstanding repertoire (which includes the original Sicario). Without the inclusion of the protagonist (Kate Mercer) from the original film, this lacks the moral compass and political questioning that made the first more than just a thriller. This time around, we are viewing the government's actions from their point of view and this doesn't allow the audience to see their 'wrong doings' through a perspective similar to their own, making for a far less compelling narrative. Another problem with the script is the handling of Benicio Del Toro's 'Alejandro'. While Del Toro once again gives an outstanding performance, the actions of the character feel totally unbelievable and completely out of character from what we saw of him in the first film. It really wasn't a wise move changing who was arguably the anatagonist in the first film into the protagonist (and even 'hero') of this one. The film also becomes rather unbelievable and far-fetched in its (admittedly tense and entertaining) third act, and this completely contrasts from the grounded, realistic tone of the rest of the film, which is detrimental to its enjoyment. Ultimately, 'Sicario 2: Soldado' is a worse film than its predecessor due to its narrative, however it is by no means a bad one, thanks to the staging and execution of some of the set-pieces. 6/10.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
138,anthonyf94,"Revenge, cruel life and unnecessary sequels",7,5 November 2019,"Strange sequel, that has quite nothing to do with Sicario. Here at the centre of the plot there's a kidnapping but also all problem due to the recognizing of good and bad inside a world (the political-criminal one) in which there are no saints, in which morality is relative and the ideological positions are often broken in favour of personal revenges or interestings: so Del Toro's character, that, as in the first movie, separate his aim from the aim of the team that he should be part of. But, in general this movie isn't so necessary in a saga point of view. Good visual and musical atmospheres, good director and also interesting reflections about criminal traffics; but nothing of that really shines (the same plot is a little confused), even if it is pleasant to watch.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Honestly I thought director Stefano Sollima gave us as much grittiness and intensity as Sicario, and had almost an identical thrilling atmosphere seeping through its entirety. Dare I say this particular story was even more well written by Taylor Sheridan as it added many new facets that relate to the climate and time we are living in. It gave an extremely interesting scope on domestic terrorism, cartel/gangs, border patrol/issues, and the defense from an american military standpoint. I know it's a film, but id have to say, it seems like a pretty accurate representation of these real life issues. Within all of these pulse pounding moments, Josh Brolin and Benicia Del Toro are fantastic and give absolutely wonderful performances like we are all so used to by now. While the dramatic/emotional aspects of the story become a bit slow yet interesting, from time to time, the insane action is right around the corner to liven the intensity back up every time. Overall a very good thrilling drama, that I honestly believe is on par with Sicario, but people shouldn't expect it to be a direct type of sequel, but a spin off type sequel.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

That Right There That Scene After Alejandro Tells Him That We Care a Lot For Alejandro As He's Doing Something That's Right in The Right Way And Not Doing The Other Thing That's Bad, Because i Think Alejandro Sees inside Of Isabel That's She Reminds Him As a Daughter That He Once Had.

Did the writer just do this up quick for the cash, I'm not entirely sure? However, I am sure that this film was no where near as interesting, intelligent, intense or as unique as the original film. This seemed much more like a Michael Bay film, but sadly also worse than Bay's best films. Compared to the original Sicario film, this was flat out lame. It feels so forced and hollow. The actors did their best with what they had, but they had so little to work with in terms of characters and more than anything, story. Have I mentioned that I pretty much hate new Hollywood? Especially for continuing to try to ruin good films of the past by quickly slapping together high budget sequels without good scripts. What's the point of this, to try and make us all stay home and watch movies online only? I thought with these actors, that perhaps this could be at least a decent sequel. Ugh, was I wrong. I mean, sure, the film is sort of entertaining and overall okay I suppose, but it pales in comparison to the first as if they were barely even trying to tell an interesting story here.

And some highly intense actionscenes. It had me and my buddy at the edges of our seats from the beginning to the end of the movie.This time however the plot is too thin.It starts off with some terrorist attacks on the american side of the border. Why the mexican drugcartels would commit terror on US-soil is never explained. But somehow the american government knows this wasnt ISIS. Because Matt Graver is once again hired by the government to bring down the mexican drugcartels. He is allowed to get dirty and start an all out war. He brings in Alejandro again. And he starts the war by kidnapping some drug lords daughter and make it seem like it was done by another cartel. Something goes wrong and alot of corrupt(?) mexican policemen are killed. The girl escapes. Alejandro goes after her. The dead policemen makes the government pull the plug on the whole war, before it ever starts . Matt tells Alejandro to kill the girl, but he refuses. After this the film goes from bad to worse.The so called war on the cartels, never really happens. In the orginal it felt like a war. Here I felt cheated. Not just because of the lack of action, but because, the story never evolved into anything but mediocrity. In the first one, the mission was to bring down a certain druglord. And for Alejandro it was personal. This time Alejandro is there for no reason at all. And the goal is to bring all the cartels down. This is obviously ridiculous and impossible. And that makes the movie fail. It never really gets going. Despite the same talented leads (except from Emily Blundt) and the same studio and all that, it just doesnt deliver.

In the drug war, there are no rules--and as the cartels have begun trafficking terrorists across the US border, federal agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) calls on the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose family was murdered by a cartel kingpin, to escalate the war in nefarious ways. Alejandro kidnaps the kingpin's daughter to inflame the conflict--but when the girl is seen as collateral damage, her fate will come between the two men as they question everything they are fighting for.The sequel of Sicario offers the same dark theme of the first one, and here's the first flaw of this movie, it offers the same dark theme, with no hopeful scenes, just like the first one.. of course the story is changed, but for me, they just thought that the first did a great job with critics, audience and in the box office.Nothing new or more than the first one as the performance of Benicio Del Toro.. Josh Brolin did a little pit more than the first one. Isabela Moner is bad, just like every movie she did, she was like reading the script during acting!The story was great, but it's like some young assassins, getting trained in this movie. The movie sometimes felt like.. the creators trying to make more money of this sequel.Also, some scenes were super-unnecessary, I think they did that to make the movie longer!

Yes the trailer lessened some of the action scenes because you already see it, but there was still plenty here to enjoy, and I enjoyed it very much. First of all, they added a completely unmentioned plot point that was very interesting and in ways kept you guessing. The trailer also makes you think that the film is about Brolin vs. Del Toro, but this could not be further from the point. I would have walked out if it was exactly like the trailer, but thankfully it was not.And yes, its not necessarily as good as the first one, but sequels rarely stand up to their predecessor, BUT sequels also rarely are as good as this one. Most of the time we either get pitiful attempts at capturing the success of the original, or ones that god completely off the reservation and blow it. BBut this sequel still captured the feel of the first, the emotion of the first, and the great dialog of the first.

159,warthogjump,Del Toro the saviour,8,30 June 2018,"It was darker, more violent and Benicio Del Toro was cooler than ever, but yet it was not as good as the original Sicario. Whether it is a sequel or a 'spin off' the plot and flow of the original Sicario was far superior. Emily Blunt was the moral compass of the film and in this subsequent Sicario we have literal chaos ensue, and although it is no doubt fun as an action film it is also less compelling as a story. Del Toro's acting, however, in a number of separate scenes was beyond phenomenal. If anything this second instalment of Sicario is worth it for the development of Del Toro's mysterious Alejandro character. Edit: The cinematography was also stunning.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
160,amirmustafaa,Just About as Good as the First One...Maybe Better,8,7 October 2018,"Lets face it. The main thing that made the first Sicario a good movie was Benicio Del Toro's character. He was so dark and twisted, yet it was impossible not to be intrigued by him. Don't get me wrong, the first Sicario was a well made movie, but it didn't get really exciting until Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro got down and dirty and showed how twisted they were. The thing that makes Day of the Saldado a powerful and gut wrenching movie is the fact that the movie starts of with the same dark and twisted Alejandro that we were left off with at the end of the first Sicario, and the tension and excitement that was at the end of the first movie is carried through out most of Soldado. To put it simply, this movie is what i wanted all of the first movie to be, not just the last 30 minutes. This movie also has great cinematography even though it wasn't shot by Roger Deakens. Is it perfect? No, but I would be lying if i said it wasn't more powerful than the first movie. I definitely wouldn't mind seeing a third Sicario movie.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
161,210west,Hollywood liberals take their usual gratuitous swipe at the President,5,30 June 2018,"Does Hollywood allow a film to be released these days without some sort of gratuitous liberal virtue-signaling vis-à-vis the President? This film, I'm sorry to say, just couldn't resist (I guess that's a pun), and as a result it went right off the rails -- for me at least -- halfway through, leaving one unsure of whom to root for during a key stretch of the story. And when you're watching a thriller, it's good to have someone to root for. The first ""Sicario"" was my favorite film of 2015. However, in this sequel, the U.S. government suddenly becomes almost as unsympathetic as the Mexican drug cartels -- which may be politically correct, but boy, it sure is tired. Yes, the film was exciting in a popcorn-chomping way -- give me helicopters, heavy-duty weapons, and a convoy of armored vehicles and I'm happy -- but it lacked the very appealing Emily Blunt and was ultimately a lot less satisfying than the first.P.S. I'll bet a lot of people will complain about the ominous droning musical score, but I thought it worked brilliantly in the first film and pretty effectively here.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

164,MVictorPjinsiste,Shifting Focus,6,20 October 2018,"This is a good movie, with a reasonable amount of action, great acting and overall a pleasant experience, but unfortunately it doesn't equal the original.IMO, the main problem is a shifting focus: The movie starts with a terrorism problem, which is reavealed as a frontier problem, a frontier that is exploited by what were up to this point Mexican drug cartel. So a plan is elaborated to start a war between the cartels.But then, that too gets lost, as both main protagonists deviate from their (shifting) mission to ""listen to their hearts"" and save the narco-princess from themselves. This is some serious character de-construction, and not in the good sense. In the first movie, Brolin was a blasé, yet realistic kind of guy with no emotional weakness, while Del Toro was at first glance a nice guy, but he revealed to be a ruthless killer. Here, both fill the void left by Blunt's absence by deviating away from their character, and it doesn't make the story better- to the contrary, it hijacks it to go nowhere.On the plus side, the main actors really are great, and that applies to the new girl. All actors are well-directed, the editing is sharp, the camera is efficient with aerial shots that, I guess, became the Sicario movies' standards as is the oppressing music and armored cars. But the suspence isn't as much intense, and the focus is lost too many times. That being said the movie is good enough to keep me interested in a third part.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Evidently Lionsgate wants to treat their audience like suckers by taking their wallets for another spin on this franchise, but they won't be getting any of mine.

167,ty-jensen,Good sequel,7,5 September 2021,"I watched Sicario yesterday and I thought about watching the sequel then. Sicario: Day of the Soldado or simply Sicario 2 is another good sequel.The acting is great like in the first film. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are still great as their characters. Isabella Merced is great, it may be years before we see her give a bad performance.Sicario 2 doesn't rehash the first film, it goes in a different direction. Matt and his team starts a war between Mexican cartels. They're fighting dirty since the cartels are smuggling terrorists into America. The film is standalone, you don't have to see the first film to understand it.The story is morally gray and complex, its not a simple investigation or revenge thriller. Matt and Alejandro especially are anti-heroes so you may view them as bad guys. The film examines war's effects on kids but I was honestly bored by the teenage boy subplot.The film is quicker than the first film despite the lackluster subplot. I'm not saying the first film was really slow, I'm saying the sequel moves along faster. The film has more action and I use that term loosely. The action scenes are brutal and efficient like in real life.Overall, Sicario 2 is another good sequel. Yes, the first film was better. If you hated Sicario, don't bother seeing this. A third film is rumored so filming may begin this fall.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

169,FabledGentleman,Not even close to the original,5,9 July 2018,"Sigh. Well i knew it, the moment i saw the trailers, i knew it. And i didn't need to see the trailers either tbh. How often does a sequel become better than it's predecessor? How often has that happened in movie history? Not very often. It's not even many times the sequel becomes equally good as it's predecessor.This isn't one of those either. This film delivers pretty much the same cast, just with added explosions. There is no real finesse in the story, maybe a small surprise here and there, but ultimately, this entire story feels like it happens just because it can. The plot is full of silly coincidences that instead of adding more tension, just makes the movie feel silly and ridiculous.To say it in an easy way, this movie is not Aliens, it's Rambo II.The film delivers several scenes just to add action to the overall story, but some of these scenes serves absolutely no purpose what so ever, other than to be action scenes added. This is a really bad move, this is basically exactly how Michael Bay plans his movies. Add action, then find a story that fits around it.This movie disappointed me so much, I'm not going to spend much time talking about the people involved. But the actors did a good job for the most part, and Del Toro carries the film on his shoulders.But the script, the direction and the cinematography does not stand out in any way. Let's take the cinematography for example. In the trailers you already see it, this movie has basically just copied Deakins work from the original. And what's funny, is that if Deakins had filmed this movie, not even he had copied himself, as he believes every movie should have it's own look.But this movie has the same angles in the shots, the same overhead follow shots, night vision, heat vision, same behind car follow shot, same drone on the side of moving cars shots. And so on and so on.When it all comes together it just feels like an empty attempt of replicating what made the first film so good. But what this movie ultimately lacked was a director like Denis Villeneuve and a cinematographer like Roger Deakins.The soundtrack also feels like a poor imitation of the original film. Everything is just copy paste, and then add a shocking scene here, and a shocking scene there, and add some more firepower. That's all this movie is. And that could have been avoided, with just a good story without silly and totally unbelievable coincidences. It just completely ruins the overall experience.When there is tension building up, and it does happen at times. It just get's shattered to the point i shook my head in disbelief due to lazy writing. sigh.It's a shame, really is. What a potential this movie had, i looked forward to it so much, one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me. But yeah i kinda knew it, what made the first film great was Villeneuve, he is the man that made it work. Because if you think about it, the first film could very easily have come off as plain silly and over the top, and then again totally unbelievable. But it worked, and that is because the people took care of the material and presented it the right way.This is not the case here with this film.5/10 - Mediocre",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Well, apart from the great photography, there is not much that can be saved of this movie: the story is more than convoluted, I had a hard time to get a grab on it. You start with a terroristic attack presumably of islamic origins, then you discover that the terrorist were helped by Somali pirates to travel to Mexico and finally the Mexican cartels helped them enter the US....ugh...just to discover that in the end the terrorists might have been Americans...ugh ugh...
So the evil forces of the US government decide to retaliate by unleashing a war among the Mexican Lords of Drugs (why? ugh...)
And this is just the beginning, as I don't want to spoil the story I let you imagine the rest; I just tell you that you will see, probably a first ever, a man shot in the head from 20cm with a semi-automatic big caliber gun, getting up and walking away.

183,lhunt-9,My favourite film of 2018,10,11 November 2018,"A movie like Sicario can work if you understand it as a moral tale. The second instalment, Day of the Soldado, succeeds for that reason. The primary protagonists, Benicio Del Toro and Isabela Moner, aren't by any means innocent, but they are subject to insults that are not warranted, and thus struggle to survive in a violent world that neither chose to inhabit. Josh Brolin plays Del Toro's counterpart, with respect, but with torn allegiances. I didn't think beforehand that this could work without Emily Blunt (or Denis Villeneuve), but it did. A lot of what is ""right"" about this movie is broadly technical. I watched in 4K on a Klipsch Atmos 9.1 system. The sound is 3D crisp and immersive, and the cinematography is stunning. As for the acting, literally every major character is nothing less than brilliant. Del Toro and Isabela Moner stole the show, while Brolin carried the heavy weight of his divided, tough-minded character flawlessly. With respect to gaps in narrative or quality, there were none. Seamless start to finish. There was not a slow minute in the entire film, and the scene selection and editing were also masterful. This is probably my favourite film of 2018.Given the cliffhanger ending, obviously, part III is in the works. It would still be nice to have Emily Blunt back.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
184,gooseshaw,"A fine action movie, but a disappointing sequel.",6,13 April 2020,"This is a fairly generic sequel for a fairly unique movie. Sicario (2015) was a small-scale (comparatively), tight, intense drama with various action scenes. The movie had a story it was trying to tell within a violent setting. The sequel however, seems more like boring and stale premise that's been injected into an albeit well-done action movie.In all honesty, I knew what I was going to get here. Having enjoyed Sicario, my disappointment began with the trailer for Day of the Soldado. To put it simply, I'm not one for straight action movies, not unless the action is accompanied by something more. In my opinion, Sicario: Day of the Soldado does not offer anything more.Having said all of this, the action is well-done and fun to watch. But it's the only fun thing to watch in the movie.

The acting, of course, is top notch. Benicio and Brolin are absolutely perfect bringing their characters to life.

188,plpregent,Worthy sequel,7,3 July 2018,"Despite the absence of many key names (Denis Villeneuve, Emily Blunt, Roger Deakins, Johann Johannsson) that stood out in the previous outing's credits, Sicario: Day of the Soldado essentially generates the same kind of nerve-racking atmosphere as the first film. Relative unknown Stefano Sollima takes Denis Villeneuve's seat as the director, and seriously makes a name for himself with some great scenes that deliver as much tension and shocking moments as what made Sicario the fine thriller that it is.The film kicks off with two highly intense scenes depicting horrors - that, unfortunately, have become frequent occurrences over the course of the last few years - with jaw-dropping realism and intensity. As you catch your breath from all this horrifying havoc, you will then be taken to a familiar character, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), being ordered by a high profile politician to start a war between different cartels. Graver, being the master of shady border operations that we got to know in Sicario, then gets in contact with Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) and teams up with him yet again to start fires left and right with different cartels and foster a large-scale conflict among them. One of these operations consists in the abduction of a drug lord's daughter, Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner). However, a number of things do not go according to the plan, and sooner than later, bloodletting ensues. The first Sicario was delivered to its audience through the eyes of agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). She was the fish out of water, stuck in the middle of shady operations and all the strange and scary characters that it involved. Things were being hidden from her, and from the audience as well. She was just as shocked about it all as the audience was. This second opus takes a different approach: it never hides that the operations, as shady as they may be, come from the higher political echelons. With Macer out of the equation, this leaves all the focus on two characters that left me asking for more when the first film's credits started rolling: Alejandro and Graver. Both are great characters, and needless to say, Del Toro and Brolin really steal the show. Del Toro is frighteningly calm, sometimes erupting in bursts of savage violence, other times showing hints of humanity, especially as his relationship with Isabel Reyes evolves. A good example is a very nice scene in which both characters seek shelter and meet a deaf man. On the other hand, Josh Brolin is such a strong presence. His voice, his look, and his performance again make his character one of the main attractions of the film. His demeanor, and some of the lines that he drops, while many are subtle, bring a lot of depth to an otherwise (again!) slightly underused character. Also, Isabela Moner does a phenomenal job and has a very bright future ahead of her. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography advantageously compares to Roger Deakins', which is especially noticeable with those great night shots in the desert. The film is visually crisp and the work on lighting is always on point. The late Johann Johannsson is obviously not returning. However, the music by Hildur Guðnadóttir is just as tense as the first film's memorable soundtrack and has a very powerful presence in this sequel as well.On the downside, the last third of the film felt a bit rushed and unfolded in a bit of a conventional manner, despite including a couple of memorable and unusual moments. Taylor Sheridan's (who also wrote the first film) script starts very strong, but left me with the impression that certain promising things were dropped along the way, while ending up leaning towards an easy window for yet another sequel. However, the dialogue is solid, and I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan also included a sub-plot that involves Mexican youth once again. There is also another convoy scene. While it's not nearly as tense as that in the first film when the convoy enters Juarez, this one is more action-packed than any scene from the first outing. On that note, be aware that Sicario: Day of the Soldado is much more action-oriented than its predecessor, which overall felt a bit more cerebral.Again, I am amazed that, quality-wise, the trademark aspects (music, cinematography, tension) from the previous film were so successfully maintained, despite many marquee names missing this time around. They made it work as a sequel and, therefore, as a franchise. And they left me wanting to see a third chapter, too.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

It deals with the smuggling of immigrants across the Mexican border as well as terrorism. Josh Brolin is a lot meaner in this and once it involves terrorism his character resorts to even more brutal tactics to achieve his goals.The action scenes are intense and realistic. The film is really atmospheric and the performances from Brolin and Del Toro are brilliant. But towards the end it becomes convoluted and starts to fall into familiar territory. It becomes unfocused because it deals with a few plot lines which feel irrelevant to the central story. One plot line that involves a young man being groomed into smuggling could have been left out as there was no room for it in the film. It tackles themes like immigration, terrorism and drug smuggling and though those messages do hit the mark, some of them just feel forced while others just get brushed aside. The ending is unsatisfying as it feels implausible and it wraps things up too quickly even leaving some things unresolved. There is always going to be comparison to the first film which was so good. However Sicario 2 is a great sequel that builds upon the world that film created. Full of violent dramatic moments and some interesting characters, it mostly exceeds expectations even if it has some plot inconsistencies and a daft ending.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

In the first film there was a greater sense of menace and the contrast between Blunt's 'stooge but earnest' character and the others gave a good counterpoint. The introduction of the child here makes up for some of it but she is too mush of a passive character to make up the difference. HOWEVER, if this was the first film you would still be blown away. del Torro and Brolin make for an intense buddy movie - if you could call it that. The cinematography is extraordinary, as is the soundtrack yet again (though not by Jóhannsson, who sadly passed away). Of course the film 'suffers' also from the fact that we already know the psychological landscape that this film traverses. It's not quite as eye-opening.

Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro connected to each other delivering thrilling plot of how drug businesses nowadays is more for political interest.This time, Sicario 2, somehow is totally wrong. They should have come up with better idea than forcing to connect martyrs and latin countries drug mobs. Such a rushy script for deadline that cannot be postponed.Alejandro Gillick should have stayed cold blooded accidental one man soldier. By gunning down a family of druglord that easy, now how he could fall in to druglord's daughter without hesitation?So now it is a franchise. Every character or story in Hollywood believed has acts of ""heroism"" should create more and more bucks nowadays. Check them all out from Fast Furious, John Wick, Jack Reacher, etc, and none of the sequel is better. The mysterious boy is a successor?

It was intense, well-developed and based on a tragic reality of many Mexican states that have violence levels on par with war-torn Syria. (Check out the gruesome documentary Cartel Land to verify). But sadly, I suspected that there was no reason for a sequel to the well-done Sicario and I was right. Without giving too much away, this one is confusing, illogical and just not very engaging. Plus the ending will have you saying WTF! The fact that Taylor Sheridan, a very fine writer who wrote the first one, also penned this one, shouts ""money grab"" in comparison to his other fine works. If I hadn't seen the original, I might have given this one 5 stars, but I can't erase my memory, so I must compare and this mess comes up lacking big time.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

We get it, asking the US Army for equipment comes with a funny contract of things you can and cannot do in your script and movie. LAME.Also, Emily Blunt who was the most interesting aspect about Sicario 1 is painfully absent from the sequel. Perhaps she was smart enough not to be associate with is mess of a script.Bottom line: Too long, too redundant, thinly veiled Military Commercial.

Its actors and action scenes are great, and the story is gripping enough. It's not boring to watch and I really enjoyed it. Still, it doesn't have the real ending. We have an ending for Alejandro and Miguel, but not for Isabel and the whole plot. We don't see this war that our characters wanted to start, and don't see how Reyes reacts to his daughter being kidnapped either. It makes an impression that she's just a girl nobody cares about. Thus, I rate this film only 7/10, but only for it's incompleteness.

But this one Sicario II has failed me as it did not have a curious and interesting plot line to grasp my attentionI watched it as i started it not because i wanted to watch it. Story was bit boring and Plot has holes everywhere and some scenes are really disconnected i guess. It is very hard to keep our attention when the story skips whole lot of mid scenes and go straight for a end scene.

200,miroslavhradel,"Stylish, but its plot turns out to be utter nonsense",3,16 October 2020,"The second Sicario movie does succeed in terms of its visual appearance, featuring many shootouts and chases that could be described as made with attention to detail and hence convincing in itself. Equally, the performances are pretty good. However, the film's plot turns out to be a complete mess.The opening scene features an Islamic suicide bomber activating a grenade in the middle of a desert, having found himself surrounded by police officers while trying to cross the border between Mexico and the United States as an illegal immigrant. The ridiculous scene is then seemingly given sense by the occurrence of a terrorist attack that appears to have been perpetrated by a couple of other like-minded guys who had come to the United States via the same route. Finally, everything goes back to its original ridiculousness when two of the suicide bombers are briefly mentioned as domestic terrorists later in the movie.The heroes first harass a Somali pirate, only to conclude that Mexican cartels were behind the terrorist attack. Eventually, they decide to kidnap a kingpin's daughter in order to start a war between two rival cartels. More grotesqueness follows as the heroes kill some of the helpers of one of the cartels on the streets of Mexico City in broad daylight, with cars slowly passing by in the background like nothing happened. As the movie progresses, similar scenes start to pile up, concluding with a group of lowly cartel helpers being gunned down in the middle of a desert by a battalion in two helicopters. Last but not least, the movie ends with a surviving cartel helper apparently teaming up with the operative he had previously tried to kill, suggesting that there will be another sequel.No war between two rival cartels ever occurs. The kingpins are just as invisible as the American president and the heroes are unrestrained as they keep demonstrating their power by repeatedly shooting up a bunch of meaningless scoundrels who are primarily looking into earning some money by helping one of the cartels.Ultimately, the movie feels like a piece of political propaganda, with the scene of a mother and her daughter getting killed by a terrorist's exploding grenade being the most explicit example of its exploitative nature. The film's implausible plot is complemented by uninspired and scarce dialogue. Equally, the pace is pretty unstable, more or less randomly switching between dynamic shootouts and chases in broad daylight and slow walks through dark slums and deserts at night.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Cut a few more useless scenes and we're now introduced to a bearded, and rough American who's ready to setup a fight between 2 warring cartels, the aim? Kidnap the daughter and blame it on the other group lol.
Fast forward 30 more boring minutes, again, Mr Genius Director uses the cliché:

205,tfmiltz,Where was the CARAVAN ?,1,16 November 2018,I'm sure Fox News will LOVE giving THIS movie attention to stir up more paranoia about all people from Mexico being Sicarios.Too many loose marbles in this venture - Was it the Walmart scene? Was it the little girl being kidnapped? that what was the purpose of that again? US DEA says hey - let's kidnap a girl- it will make Trump putting kids in cages look like something that can be manageable by the press?Movie ends with an ADULT?

One can ONLY WONDER if it was psycho-political babble put out to help build that fear of the CaravanThis movie made DEA out to be KIDNAPPERS - indeed.Yet they get to fly around in their EXPENSIVE AS F Blackhawk helicopters WE ALL PAID FOR - kidnapping little girls.NICE paint job - AGAIN - this movie makes Trump putting kids in cages look like an episode of Dora the Explorer in a Ski Resort in Abu Dhabi.This isn't even a movie - BEWARE - do NOT WATCH- They kidnap a little girl to induce a cartel war so the US can brand cartels as 'fer sure' terrorists. GEE- makes you wonder if ISIS is MANUFACTURED to 'get that terror response' SAME THING - who SCRIPTED this - WHO PAID THEM - and WHO is SELLING this PROPAGANDA AS IF it's a movie?This movie makes me want to write some software that acts as an ACTOR or SCREENWRITER FIREWALL - that pops up if I see something with an actor on my list - and BLOCKS IT - as I will SURELY DO MANUALLY for ANY AND EVERYONE IN THIS CROCKPOT FULL OF HORSE MANRURE LEFT ON FOR 18 days in the Mexican desert PRESENTING ITSELF as a MOVIE.,Sicario - Day of the Soldado

210,grantbullert,A Gripping and Intense Second Installment,8,18 July 2018,"""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" is a tense ride all the way through. What it lacks in story it makes up for with tension and action.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: This second installment delivers drama with force and leaves hardly any questions for the viewer, unlike the first film which left the audience in the dark for much of the movie. The two approaches are different, but it works well in both. Stefano Sollima is not on the same directing level of Denis Villenueve, but he holds his own. He proves he knows how to handle action and suspense. A few moments in the film had a bit messy direction, but overall it is a strongly directed film. *Cinematography/Editing: Once again, the first film is a tough one to follow. Having to step into the same space as Roger Deakins is no easy thing to do. Dariusz Wolski crafted some compelling and beautiful images. He helped bring back the feel of the first Sicario film, but it is near impossible to match the mastery of Roger Deakins. Much of the film was near the same level of the work of Deakins, but a few scenes fell short. Wolski did his job by helping to tell the story visually. Not much more can be asked of him. The editing was phenomenal in action sequences, but some cuts seemed to come to late during dialogue scenes which gave the film an odd pace at times. Most of the film is cut very well, but there were a few missteps. What is very disappointing is that the final scene feels very out of place and has an odd ending that left the movie feeling flat. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is nearly perfect for much of the film. It is engaging and realistic. However, a few times it seems to be a bit too overly dramatic. The actors do their best to not make it seem way too dramatic. Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro are both fantastically stoic throughout the film. They carry the film along. Isabela Moner gives an incredible performance as well. *Music/Sound Design: The soundtrack is dark and intense. It doesn't reach the level of the first film, but it still communicates emotion wonderfully. The sound design is real and immersive. It is one of the strong points of the film. It is a tool that is well used in this film. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set pieces, locations, and costumes are all good quality. Nothing stands out as spectacular, but it certainly holds up as being a well executed film in production terms. The special effects are on par with what can be expected from a drama/action film in this day and age. Explosions had a force to them that made the audience feel them. Gore was believable and of high quality. There wasn't a moment that took me out of the film. It was easy to get lost in the world of Sicario.*Conclusion: ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" kicks the action and drama up a notch, but falls a bit below its predecessor in terms of storytelling. It is definitely worth seeing, though.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

216,Vinegaroon3,Disappointing....,4,1 July 2018,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this movie. I loved the first one...But I just finished watching it a couple of hours ago, and the more I ponder it, the more I realize it simply wasn't very good at all.This film was littered with plot holes, implausible twists, and vague direction. Honestly, it absolutely reeked of lazy writing. It was like they were counting on making money just by drawing in fans of the first ""Sicario"". Even the motives of the main characters, laser focused in the first film, were about as clear as mud in this second iteration.I cannot say much more without risking spoilers, but suffice to say I do not recommend this movie. I am genuinely disappointed, as this was a film I was looking forward to after really liking the first one. If the producers made a lazy effort knowing they would still cash in after the success of the first film, I guess it worked on me.***Edit*** I have written quite a few IMDB reviews, and with this film it certainly appears there is an organized effort to down-vote negative reviews, and up-vote positive ones. With the new IMDB review structure, this quite effectively buries any critical reviews of this film. They cannot even be seen without investing quite a lot of time and effort.

I had seen that Emily Blunt wasn't returning for Sicario: Day of the Soldado, so I was a little worried that it'd just be a cash-grab, lacking much of what made the first one an instant classic. Fortunately, Blunt's character is the only thing the second movie was missing, as it manages to deliver every ounce of the same intensity and suspense the first one had in spades. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro are the same powerful forces of nature as they've always been, retaining their characters' same nuance and relentless drive that they had three years ago. Day of the Soldado is about as worthy a sequel as you can get, and is absolutely worth watching for fans of the original.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
220,zippyflynn2,"Extra Heavy on the BS, Hysteria and Totally Unnecessary",4,5 October 2018,"While the first Sicario was fairly well done, a somewhat believable look into the murders and assassinations surrounding and between the Mexican cartels, this film becomes utter nonsense from the opening scene. Since the attacks of 9/11 there have been zero terrorist attacks on US soil nor are there international plots to destroy you personally, along with other ordinary Americans shopping at a mall in the Midwest or some other relatively remote and internationally inconsequential American location. There's already enough wild exaggeration and nonsensical hyperbole being spouted by racists, ignorant nationalists, and paranoid hysterics regarding immigrants (which has been virtually everyone living in the US or their ancestors short of the Native Americans) to the point that moronic bullies run around yelling at and even attacking people for speaking a language other than English, which is in itself an immigrant language to America. The last thing we need is to have Hollywood making contrived movies about abject nonsense of terrorism that just doesn't exist. What is not needed is more fuel to the fire that the unhinged, the raging, and the willfully ignorant like to use as a half-baked excuse to be racists and/or people of violence. There's enough ignorance and staggering stupidity in America presently. Too many people too often feed into hysteria and dream of scenarios that never will exist of them being a target of some international plot of evil doers because it gives them an exaggerated sense of importance rather than being the relatively inconsequential and insignificant members of the boring masses. The good news is they'll never be attacked by Jihadi John here on American soil but the bad news is to be exceptional they'll have to put in all the hard work themselves to be so and it is not magically given to them by being American. People who are honest with themselves don't buy into nonsense and mythical stories.

Give it a watch.,9,31 January 2020,"If you like, or can tolerate, those dark, dark movies that get on your nerves and chafe your weary conscience with the idea that you REALLY need to be doing something to right some of the world's wrongs; then go enjoy this experience. It's truly more than a movie, it's an immersive experience- as long as you can view it commercial free.What makes this film great is the excellent cinematography, near perfect pacing, fine acting, tight, plausible story, and oddly ironic parts in the gritty realism.And truly, what beats real life for some of the weirdest contrasts and bizarrely ironic situations? For example, one of my favorite scenes is where all these big-time, hard-ass American G-men are sitting in a bright, modern mall food-court listening to cheerful music and eating tasty mall food while plotting an international kidnapping and likely multiple murders. Only in America. The filmmakers did these moments quite well. I wish there could have been a couple more of them to break up the literal and figurative darkness. They also created some fine character comparisons to watch in the two young anti-hero's we follow as well as in Brolin's and Del Toro's uber-tough, but not 100% void of compassion, heroes. It is a well crafted movie, but oh-so dark, especially the marvelous creepy music. And the ending? Well, let's just say that there's solid reasons the old movie greats from the 1930's-60's still are watched and adored: They give you satisfaction and resolution at the end. It's a human need.

But you feel like you get to know his character a bit more in this film; the scene with the sign language is a good example of that.There's a few parts in this film that feel like the first one (the border crossing stuff for example). I wasn't sure the storyline really worked and it felt a bit of a mess, which is what it turned out to be.

233,bbretall-1,Creates and discards plots throughout the film,4,29 June 2018,"Reading the reviews, it seems you either love this or hate it. I unfortunately fall in the latter category.
I am usually REALLY soft and forgiving on plot holes and other minor quirks in a movie as long as I am entertained. This film did NOT keep me entertained, and was in no way a worthy successor to the original Sicario. This movie had multiple-personality disorder. It would start going with a plot-line, then completely drop it and switch gears to something else. Ultimately it just felt like a confusing jumble.
It is sub-titled ""Day of the Soldier"" and that's an apt name, all of the far too few action sequences had highly trained & heavily armed US Special Forces guys completely overwhelming their opponents. No real tension at all. Maybe something to love here for ""rah-rah America, see how they can pummel those backward foreigners!!"" but I found it to be lacking in any punch.
The trailers had this seem like a ""war on the drug cartels"" film. There is virtually none of that as the film mostly bogs down in a really contrived kidnapping scheme that was supposed to set off a war between the cartels, but the film showed NONE of that.
Brolin & his team just go across the border into Mexico at will in helicopters and armored vehicles and end up slaughtering lots of people, most of whom are not even obvious cartel members (yes, they WORK for the cartels, but I'd have liked to see engagement with some actual Cartel forces, not Federales and lawyers who work for them). 
This film highlights American aggression and is strong on a total disregard for Mexico's sovereignty with a bit of ""Muslim fear/hysteria"" thrown in and then quickly abandoned.
That said....acting by Brolin & Del Toro was top-notch, but not enough to save this mish-mash with no cohesive through-plot and plot fragments that had holes wide enough to fly one of the military helicopters through.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

241,SaidNDone,Unfocused and convoluted,4,23 September 2018,"The story bounces around from plot line to plot line, starting with a poorly conceived terrorist attack (why the Mexican border?), then going to Africa, before dropping the entire first act plot with a one line explanation and spending the rest of the movie in Mexico (due to the previous plot focus being dropped, them being in Mexico past the first act made no sense either).""Day of the Soldado"" is engaging at times, but with basically no storyline and a plot so all over the place that it may as not exist, there is no follow through on anything, leaving the movie an unsatisfying mess (throughout the entire 2 hour run there is literally 0 storyline or character progression, the characters just run around like headless chickens in Mexico for an hour then go back to America with literally nothing having happened). It really feels like ""Day of the Soldado"" only exists to give context for a third movie. Really disappointed considering how good the first movie was.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
242,alexis-21-81191,Pleasantly different yet weak in execution,7,18 May 2019,"I don't remember the 1st one, so I will not treat this as a sequel review, even though I understand people complaints about character inconsistency regarding Alejandro. Nonetheless, hearing the interview I personally completely agree with the character Arc Del Toro is going through. More than logical that even a Sicario will grow conscience the moment he realizes that he's now doing to that girl, pretty much what her father's assassins did to his daughter, a realization that leads to a short passage into the righteous side and not character inconsistency, seems by the end of the film, he's again back to his old self and with an apprentice this time, which I thought was a very good touch.
Totally agree with everyone complaining about the excessive acting from the really talented young girl.
Despite the realistic touch to the characters which I enjoyed very much, and the exemplary acting, especially from the genius Benicio, the narrative is incredibly weak. Dialogue is flat yet ok since this is an action film, but there's no specific POV we follow to really connect with the film. Incredible mistake really for a film of such magnitude. To simplify my argument, I would say that this is a film without a main character, and it's a sequel of a film with a very elevated main character.
Yes in the end everything connects and we get a story, but the way it is told, it's impossible in my opinion to connect with any of the characters.
What's really disappointing, is that by simply eliminating the first 15 minutes of completely unrelated extra information, they could have added a really powerful sequence of Alejandro and the little girl that could've potentially managed to connect with the audience in a much higher level, and made this an action movie, with an actual action sequence in it.
But despite this, it was enjoyable and the few twists at the end made it a decent watch.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
243,lawrencestevens-58369,"Good, but not as spectacular as the first.",8,10 July 2018,"You can tell this is a different director, and the tone and style is quite different from the first. The soundtrack and cinematography are great again. Once again benecio steals the show as Alejandro, and Brolin is also great (he's having a great summer so far). This films is not about drugs like the first was, but more on human trafficking, and focuses on the affect of the drug war on children. There is more action this time around, and some of the events in the film can be a bit unrealistic, which is upsetting as the first one felt pretty real to me. There is one scene in the beginning which is quite harrowing, and that sub-plot kind of leads nowhere. The ending was a bit rushed I feel, and I wanted it to be tied up a bit more, and it is clear they are setting up a third movie, but it doesn't seem like a cash grab like Jurassic world 2 felt like. This is a welcome sequel, and doesn't ruin the first as in some cases it does. I look forward to seeing the next one, if there is one (there likely will be). Overall I recommend it, if you're a fan of the first one and are interested in this sort of thing. It's sad to think this film is getting some negative reviews as it does not directly mention the current political situation on the border, and reference trump.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
244,hughrcarson,A worthy sequel,7,12 September 2018,"A series of suicide bombings in various U.S cities is growing evidence that the Mexican drug cartels have expanded their operations beyond just Class A. Their focus is now fixed upon trafficking Islamic terrorists across the U.S / Mexican border. In a risky attempt to stem this flow, the U.S government launches a sequence of covert false flag activities on Mexican soil designed to both distract and induce cartel infighting. This particular game plan will culminate with the kidnapping of the daughter of the head of one of the cartels.The margin for error, however, is perilously thin, and sure enough it's not long before all best laid plans turn sour. With the task complete, the U.S Government, fearing the unthinkable possibility of culpability, quickly decides that it is left with no other choice than to backtrack and 'clean up' all traces of its involvement.Be they Government operatives, civilians or cartel members, regardless of their allegiances, this will not be good news for any number of the pawns involved in this particular messy game.Call me naive, but I was actually quite surprised to see that Sicario had spawned a sequel. As excellent as it undoubtedly was, it just didn't seem like that kind of film.Of course, the world of big budget mainstream movie-making won't hesitate to hang its hat off anything if sufficient moolah is waved seductively in front of its fat green-eyed face. That's a given, Business is business after all.Certainly any fears that an inferior second instalment would serve only to tarnish the memory of Denis Villeneuve's gripping original, are thankfully quickly allayed.Based once again upon a Taylor Sheridan screenplay, Sicario 2: Day of the Soldado is that rarest of beasts, a sequel that stands ably on its own two feet, confidently doing more than enough in just over two hours to be considered a worthy successor to a much respected original.And you can pretty much count all such films on one hand.The performances are nicely understated across the board. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin revive their roles as Alejandro and Matt Graver, respectively. Isabella Moner puts in a nice turn as the sassy young abductee, Isabel Reyes, whilst Matthew Modine, in a rare big-screen appearance, portrays the U.S Secretary of Defence.Perhaps it's just me but try as I might to identify the man by way of something a little more current, I perpetually resign myself to that fact I will forever envisage Modine, perched on the end of a bed, Birdy-style.Stefano Sollima's matter-of-fact direction is visually striking, graphically brutal, and mercifully devoid of unnecessary clichés and sensationalism.And a tip of the hat too, to the late great Jóhann Jóhannsson, whose low growling glissando sonic motif - used to such stunning effect in Sicario and seemingly ubiquitous within any number of dark Hollywood thrillers since - lives on through the sequel's composer of choice, Hildur Guðnadóttir, once again underpinning the action with its pervading tone of menace.As for any credence behind the notion that 'two is enough' - this is well and truly put to bed by way of the film's conclusion, which, whilst being a bit of a bolted-on clunky after thought, undoubtedly leaves the door open to the prospect of a part three of this gritty franchise in which no one ever seem to come up smelling of roses.Sequel-phobic though I may well generally be, a third instalment - whilst clearly tempting fate - in this instance I'd be so bold to suggest, is actually probably no bad thing.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

It is an action movie, but really it is about making tough decisions and doing questionable things in a world that has terrorists and drug lords. What will get you to sell your soul?

247,eatpajdittsvin-520-811150,Works well as an action movie if you turn your brain off,7,15 May 2020,"Much like the first film, Soldado has a stylistic tone of Mexico as a place of great evil, which is probably somewhat biased if you ask a Mexican. If I was inclined to be harsh to the film, I would point to the beginning which conflates the cartels to islamists, an introductory plot which is then immediately dropped, amounting to a debatable quality of writing.To mention another weak point, it would have been nice to see the politics behind the scenes being better detailed than they were. What we get are nameless generic government officials saying generic things such as ""this was never about changing anything"" (paraphrased).Overall, the action scenes are all solid and that goes a long way to earning the ""decent movie"" score from me. Soldado doesn't quite manage the same level of suspense of Sicario and thus I rank the former higher.The superhero (in a contemporary way) is doubtlessly Alejandro, and he's the main reason it all works out as a decent movie, despite Macer (Emily Blunt, Sicario) missing being fairly noticeable and regrettable.

251,jrbond-57624,DiCaprio - Day of the Plothole,6,15 October 2018,"Whilst clearly a very big budget film, with on the whole, solid acting, the film suffered from the meandering plot. I watched the film and fully expected a crackdown on the drug cartels of Mexico, but what we're served up, was a kidnapping plot put together by the US Government to stir up a horvers next and war amongst rival cartels. The plot is never stable, the storyline knits together in a very contrived way and you are constantly saying ""as if"". I'm all for suspending reality and immersion in films, but this movie takes you to the very edge of plausibility and throws itself over the cliff edge. 
Firstly, what was the relevance of Somalia and the lead character eventual involvement in clandestine mercenary work against the Mexican cartels?
Secondly, if you want to start a war amongst the cartels, I'm sure you could find a simpler way than kidnapping someone's daughter. 
Thirdly, if you do decide to kidnap her, why then take her to the US and then try a daring idiotic mission to return her to another cartels territory. If you're ebdfane is to start a war, why not kill her and you've got your war?
Finally,. What was the point of the gang bangers? They were only written in to the plot to knit it together? Absolutely ludicrous at times and too stupid for wards at offers. The American Government hired mercenaries just have free reign to cross the Mexican border at will, killing anyone who gets in their way and anyone who doesn't. Far to stupid to take seriously at times and it's almost a comedy compared to the first film.

There are twists to the movie, but they are boring and confusing. It really seemed like the movie was all over the place at times. The half end of the movie is what really let me down. I wondered how they had put together almost nothing in a two hour movie. There was so little that happened, it really was astonishing.

254,BlueFox94,Violence & Deception Across Borders in Sicario: Day of the Soldado,8,9 July 2018,"(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""If you want to start a war, kidnap a prince. The king will start it for you."" - CIA Agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to U.S. Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) and CIA Director Cynthia Foards (Catherine Keener)Potential spoilers belowI find it premature when most mainstream viewers jump to labeling the most recent completed movie year as ""the best of the decade"". To that, I have always countered with the cinema of 2015, for which I have briefly mentioned my high regard in several past reviews. Whereas 2017 did not see a single five-star rating from me, 2015 alone saw five-Steve Jobs, The Big Short, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015's crown jewel for many), Sicario, and Shaun the Sheep. (Sorry, Inside Out fans, but Shaun is a modern Buster Keaton-esque masterpiece.) Down a half-star lie Son of Saul and The Revenant, followed by over a dozen strong four-star-rated films.Yes, 2015 remains my favorite film year of the 2010s thus far. Yet while the unheralded Steve Jobs reigns at the top today, it was Sicario (Español: ""hitman"") that wore the crown for me from 2015's end up until the early months of 2017. The sobering and exhilarating action thriller was directed by Denis Villeneuve, written by Taylor Sheridan, and starred a determined Emily Blunt, a laid-back Josh Brolin, an enigmatic yet intimidating Benicio Del Toro, and future Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya and former Burn Notice star Jeffrey Donovan in small roles. Three years on, Sicario still teems with cinematic riches-cinematography by Roger Deakins (who would finally win his Oscar for his next Villeneuve collaboration), an unnerving score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, a U.S.-Mexican border standoff scene that swells with tension, and the masterstroke of shifting to Benicio Del Toro's perspective for fifteen minutes towards the end.With the stand-alone sequel (subtitled in North America, and hereafter referred to, as Day of the Soldado), only writer Sheridan and actors Brolin, Del Toro, and Donovan return. Italian director Stefano Sollima (making his English and Spanish-language debut) takes over from Villeneuve. Hildur Guðnadóttir takes over from late Jóhannsson in the score, Dariusz Wolski from Deakins as cinematographer, and Matthew Newman from Joe Walker as film editor, among other technical craftspeople. Though it does not become The Empire Strikes Back of the Sicario saga, Day of the Soldado delivers on both intense visceral action and covert operation thrills.When Mexican drug cartels start smuggling Islamic suicide bombers and other terrorists across the U.S. border, CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) once again taps black operative Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) to bait the drug cartels into war with one another. To do this, they assassinate the lawyer of one cartel and kidnap Isabela Reyes (Isabella Moner), the daughter of that cartel's rival kingpin, as part of a ""false flag"" operation. When plans to abandon her in rival cartel territory fall through due to corrupt Mexican federal police officers, CIA director Cynthia Foards (Catherine Keener) and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) cancel the operation and render Isabella as collateral damage to eliminate.For Gillick, who has become protective of Isabella, that is unacceptable.Day of the Soldado falls into the unsurprising sequel trap of familiarity for roughly its first half. The opening pair of grisly suicide bombing scenes and Graver's interrogation of a detained Somalian (Faysal Ahmed) possibly connected to the incidents echo similar scenes from the first Sicario. Whereas the first movie's subplot of a corrupt Mexican police officer (Maximiliano Hernández) felt subtle and organic, Day of the Soldado's subplot of young aspiring gangster Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez, in his live action debut) comes off as contrived for much of its screentime. (A husband and father draws more sympathy than a naïve teenager.) Finally, the dual inclusion of Keener and Modine as stock action genre authority figures pales next to Victor Garber's soft-spokenness in the first film.Once writer Taylor Sheridan has finished reorienting audiences with the characters and world in the first half, he proceeds to spend the second half catapulting Day of the Soldado back to the first Sicario's high level of quality. Del Toro and the commendable Ms. Moner's race for the border is as gripping and relentless as some of the first movie's best scenes. Ms. Moner gives a strong breakout performance as the capable Isabella. At the same time, she does not take away from Del Toro's consistent command of the screen as he reprises a role that should have earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination three years ago. Be sure to pay attention to a powerful scene in which Del Toro uses American Sign Language.Day of the Soldado is not better than the first Sicario, particularly during the moments that feel too reminiscent of its predecessor. Nevertheless, Day of the Soldado proves itself as a searing second act in a gritty, relevant, and heavily mature action thriller odyssey. Its cast is sturdy and its technical craftspeople hold to the mesmerizing template established by the first movie. Above all, Day of the Soldado benefits greatly from serving its weaker components first, before building up to a jaw-dropping finale - one that leaves me optimistic for the sequel to come.(Parental Note: Sicario: Day of the Soldado has been rated R by the MPAA ""for strong violence, bloody images, and language"". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""strong bloody violence"" and ""language"", and rated O (Morally offensive) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""excessive bloody violence, at least one use of profanity, and constant rough and crude language."")R.N.B.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

258,s-maniatopoulos,Fails on all levels.,5,8 October 2018,"The sequel to the great Sicario movie fails on all levels: the story seems contrived and offensively non believable, unlike the first film, which at least did a good job of pretending to address real issues.
The politics, effectively deciding on the characters' decisions and fate, seem decided by the same people who would have sent John Rambo to save hostages by himself, or send a couple of F-15s in a foreign country to save the captured captain. In short, it reminds of all those horrible propaganda movies of the 80s, like Iron Eagle. With one major difference: those films knew they were not meant to be serious. This is not the case with Sicario 2, where all the characters are completely inconsistent and take literally mindless decisions for no plausible reason, other than to advance the film to a cathartic conclusion; which, once experienced, seems mostly ludicrous than everything else that came before it. All in all, unlike the first Sicario movie that had a wonderful direction, an excellent plot and a clear raisin-d-être, this is nothing more than a needless sequel that has been made for all the wrong reasons, whether these may be the producers' intention to launch a potential trilogy or series of films, or just a good old cash grab.
Unfortunately, these were not good enough reasons, in this particular case, and the end result suffers.
No point to talk about the (good, though uninspired) direction when the story in itself is ridiculous.

He fails to make any connection between the ISIS terrorists and the cartels, and that is the least of this film's problems.

While Josh Brolin is on form, Del Toro and Keener in particular are on autopilot while Donovan, Modine and Whigham barely feature.But what was particularly troubling about this film was its message. It portrays everyone who isn't American as a terrorist or gangster. And its terrorist plot turns out to be inconsequential to the rest of the story. But the depictions fit in with the American racist narrative of demonising Muslim people as terrorists and Mexicans as drug dealers and gangsters.

Initially movie makes you to believe something of a plot is going on but when the credits roll you will be disappointed by the way they took the story with too many plotholes. Lastly, ending has a hint for another sequel and it was so bad that i hope writer/director get back their senses and not go in that direction. I rewatched the 1st Sicario to forget this abomination.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

278,tony-146-695626,Waste of time and potential - mild spoiler only,3,23 March 2019,"This movie undid a LOT of what made the first movie great.He was in control of the situation in every way in the first movie. He is often miscalculating and bumbling in this one. Inspector Clouseau comes to mind.There is one scene where he is trying to fit in a migrant bus in order to escape, and is easily found out and then hog tied like a noobie. It is very humiliating and dumb.Plot lines are wrapped up at the last minute in very unsatisfying ways, and feels like they ran out of time and simply rushed to end it.The arc with the girl he is supposed to kill is a good example. He refuses and the movie makes it look like he will stick with her and fight the system. Instead the entire arc is ended abruptly again showing his ineptitude and general lack of planning in this movie.It is very very frustrating. I HATE this movie. The original movie was a 9. This one is a three only for some decent gun fights.And the ending. Won't spoil it, but is dumb as a doornail and its there only to tease a part 3.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
279,Ska4Live,The use of a successful project to create an empty franchise.,7,28 June 2018,"I bet, when you first saw Sicario 2 trailer on December 2017, your thoughts was ""WTF I just saw!? Why did you even try to do a second part SONY?"" Honestly for me first film, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was an amazing work with enough tension and cruel realism of modern days, great music composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson , and freaking awesome cast. But now I am still asking, why for God sake, are you even tried to make sequel, if there is not enough premises for that. Well, I must say all Trailers for Sicario 2: Day of the Soldado looks brilliant. Honestly they look like Mr. Villeneuve work, but at reality, you can felt ""his style"" only before and during Action scenes. Both characters performed by Josh Brolin and Benisio Del Toro has more screen time and probably this is main positive moment, because we can understood more about how their mind work and what are their beliefs and missions. Female character in Day of the Soldado was seriously downshifted compared to the first movie, and I must said Isabella Reyes role, performed by Isabella Moner, is a little bit not understandable for me. During film she is transforming from ""bad-ass self-confident rich school girl"" to the ""cold blooded poker-face witness of crime"", and probably(FAN THEORY - AHEAD) will be recruited by US military in third movie as a new Sicario:)) 
Music. Jóhann Jóhannsson - may his soul Rest In Peace, did an amazing work together with Hildur Guðnadóttir. Their score is something that keep your eyes always open and increase your heartbeat. 
Cinematography doesn't give you anything new. Many of shots are completely the same as it was in first movie. No, it looks good, but only if you didn't see 2015 Original.
Script. Oh man, it is the same!! Like in the original movie we see 2 lines. Main line - where we meet with our heroes, their goal and what are they doing to reach it. And the second line where we see desperate young men, from the ""other side"", and his way. 
While first movie was focused only on Mexico, relationships between DEA and FBI, Cartels and of course Benicio Del Toro character, second film ""return"" to Mexico theme, but under the prism of terrorist bomb attack in US. Human traffic, Border control, Cartel, US Military, Mexico Federal Police - everything like in the first movie. Maybe Soldado has few more actions scenes. But it doesn't change anything. SONY has decided to create franchise after 1 successful film, with the same style, theme, and almost the same script. Only audience can decide does this newly created franchise has right for a life or this experiment is one big mistake and it's better to stop using same templates and create something new.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

I made sure to watch it at the cinema at the first opportunity I had (films like this don't tend to stay at the cinema long here in England). While it's not as good as the first movie, it's still well worth checking out, make sure you watch the first one first. Emily Blunt isn't in this one, but Brolin and Del Toro return. Brolin is decent, but Del Toro is the main man in this, and he's great. If you like Narcos/Narcos Mexico, you'll like this. And I like the fact that the evil drug and people traffickers are portrayed as such. There's no glorification of criminal activity in this movie.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

It is very similar to the original, apart from the lamentable lack of Emily Blunt, who lent a touch of class to the original. While the remainder of the stars perform credibly, and the child star adds an unexpected charm, replacing the male stars might have weakened the sense of deja vu all over again. Given the abrupt end of this film, one may expect yet another sequel, which, like this one, will add more blood and guts with less plot.

286,brennandube,"Decent enough sequel, step-down from its predecessor.",7,30 June 2018,"SPOILER: 'Day of the Soldado' is directed by Stefano Sollima (did not direct the first) and is written by Taylor Sheridan who helmed the writing of the first film. Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro reprise their roles in the sequel but Emily Blunt does not return. The first film was quite the fulfilling tale, it included a well-told story that was portrayed wonderfully by the actors within the movie. Although the first films finish wasn't uplifting or happy, it did feel fulfilling. This sequel did surprise me and it's very clear when watching this film that the story is somewhat abrupt. However, I am thankful for a sequel because Benecio Del Toro really did steal the show in the first film and he truly is such a draw. His character again steals the show in this film despite in my opinion, not being as motivated. The cartel are now smuggling terrorists into the United States and the U.S government has officially put the cartel on the terrorist watch list. This means the DEA have way more jurisdiction and leeway to go in and basically start a war with the cartel. Here we have our movie. This film in my opinion, is much less layered one than the first and much less motivated as well. The pace lacks at times and that is very evident in the middle portion of the film as it begins to transcend into a very different direction as well as slow down quite a bit. I do believe Sheridan did the best job possible at writing this sequel and I am glad Blunts character was left out of the storyline. She did a great job in the first film but her presence I can tell would feel forced in 'Day of the Soldado' so props to the filmmakers and Sheridan for not being tacky with this movie. 'Day of the Soldado' offers up some good action and some truly brutal sequences. Josh Brolin gets a lot more hands on in this film and he is always fun to watch. This truly is the year of Brolin as he has 'Infinity War', 'Deadpool 2' and 'Day of the Soldado' now out. Benecio Del Toro does awesome again as previously stated and although I strongly feel his character motivations were rather blurred in this film, he offers a well enough acting job that it gets pulled off. Well done again, Benecio. The supporting cast does a solid job and younger actress Isabela Moner does a pretty good job in this movie. The other young actor who plays a larger role in this film, Elijah Rodriguez, also does a good job despite again some flaws in his story arc. 
The score is incredible just like the first film. Many of the same riffs are used in this movie and all around the sounds and music really help to enhance the story and the tension. This movie, just like the first, does a great job at building tension and intensity. 'Day of the Soldado' does lose its main drive and waivers from its strongest plot points as the film progresses, and where the first film was a truly realistic take, this one has times that feel far-fetched and a couple sequences that feel out of place. This resulted in a loss of proper pacing and the movie feeling like a stepdown from the first.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

A. The helicopters are supposedly 10 minutes out when Alejandro is about to get shot. It's night. When the choppers fly over it's broad daylight.
B. The choppers chase down the vehicles. The vehicles are going high speed BUT after the altercation, Alejandro turns up in spite of being half dead. It had to be several miles of hiking in the hot desert.
3. They were wanting the girl killed to keep her quiet but then she's to go in witness protection. Will she not talk then?

294,White_Prophet,A worthy companion piece to the first (80% - Pretty Great),8,29 June 2018,"It's not as masterfully made and great as the original, but overall, i think it comes pretty close!
This is more of an alternate version than a sequel, one that focuses more on Del Toro's character which is definitely something I wanted after watching the first Sicario. He does a great job here and so does Brolin and Isabela Moner. The intensity is still there in this movie, except this time it's for pretty much the entire run time. It does a good job portraying the horrific nature of this environment in a gritty and realistic way, much like in Taylor Sheridan's other movies. There's also a focus on how kids are affected when they get caught up in the workings of the cartels and it's crazy that things like this actually happen.
While the violence may be a bit much for some people, I thought it served the film's purpose well. Overall, it was a really intense ride and a worthy companion piece to the first Sicario.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
295,marcadams-21925,Another sequel that should of never been made,5,8 March 2020,"Sicario 2 has all the same ingredients of the first film but the change in director is apparent. The film lacks any kind of peak, it's slow and flat throughout. The first film is tense and dark, the characters are mysterious and slick. The second film has nothing new to offer in terms of the characters and how the they operate. The story is bland, boring and has no hidden surprises. I think if anything the characters are discredited in the second film for how they are portrayed in the first. There is no contrast between the good and evil either with the lack of a 'by the book' agent being present in the team.
Typical hollywood jumping on a franchise which should have been a one time film deal. I've watched it but don't really consider it a sequel.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

297,rosadorico,Turn Off After First 15 Mins,6,24 March 2020,"The opening of this movie is incredible! It's most of the trailer that sets the movie to be something incredibly different from what it ends up being. What's left is over an hour of recycled parts from the first Sicario and attempts to expand character development without any real reason.While Josh Brolin did his best to carry this in his limited parts, and DelToro mumbled his character familiarity the best he could this movie seems to have suffered from a different director. Sweeping shots that mimicked the first film break up a jumbled redemption story filled with an endless supply of forgettable henchman.Again, the opening was extremely powerful and disturbing, but the rest of the film lacked the weight of the original. So watch this if you simply want to see a subpar sequel or don't mind being let down slowly after an amazing crescendo.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
298,Leray97,"I really shouldn't like this film as much as I do, but I do.",8,1 July 2018,"Sicario: Day of the Soldado is obviously not as good as its predecessor but even for being more of an action oriented thriller than a psychological thriller like the first Sicario, I still enjoyed it. There are a couple major flaws in the movie but everything else that happens managed to win me over and I kind of wanted to see more when it was over.The best thing about Sicario: Day of the Soldado is the acting, despite how little it can do to make up for the film's flaws. I now feel the urge watch more movies that Josh Brolin has been in because he's so good at commanding screen presence here. Benicio Del Toro is really the biggest star in the film though because he gives some of the best performances and portrays his character in a way that the audience can always root for without being a true hero.Looking back to the first film, it's easier now to see how necessary it was to have Emily Blunt's fish-out-of-water character in the midst of the cartel chaos. The addition of her character alongside that of Josh Brolin's and Benicio del Toro's was a good way to mediate the clash between both sides of the ""war"" despite it being such a grey area of politics. There is some semblance of that in Sicario: Day of the Soldado with Isabela Moner's character but not nearly enough, as expected. That being said, he biggest flaw of this film lies in its overall story because there's only so much drug cartel stuff an action thriller can show without stepping into the dimension of mediocrity that's occupied by other movies with a similar subject. In an attempt to avoid this, the filmmakers of Sicario: Day of the Soldado decide to have the audience watch a subplot gradually develop involving a character that ends up bringing the entire story down a notch or two. The fact that it plays a sizable role in the movie's unsatisfying ending only adds on to my disappointment. I really shouldn't like this film as much as I do, but I do.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

To see that both the main characters show that they have a heart and a conscience and they're not brainless order takers, was a good touch. You get to see a little more into their psyche and ""their why"" they do what they do. The ending was surprisingly unexpected and now I'm wondering what's next in this storyline!

It was the most amazing action movie I have seen in recent years. The plot was smart and the delivery was perfect. The cool guys were cool and the bad guys were bad. Most importantly the tension between Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro representing different organizations playing by different rules but trying to achieve the same goal. That was what made the movie interesting and a cut above the hundred of garbage gun fighting action movies made every year.This sequel did not need to be made. The plot line does not make sense.

The only memorable feature of the trailer of Del Toro firing a pistol like a sub-machine gun. It did not seem like this sequel had the same kind of tension as the first movie. When I began to see the film, I wasn't impressed by the beginning. Islamic terrorists coming from Mexico? Only Tom Clancy would come up with the idea of a jihadista. But about ten minutes into the movie, the tone began to shift and the original Sicario was back! Especially I liked the premise of the film that the most profitable traffic in this day and age is not cocaine but people. I had a couple of unanswered questions, though. If the convoy had not been ambushed, where would they have gone? Whatever happened to the war that the U.S. Government wanted to trigger? No mention was made about the war between the cartels. Tel Toro's acting was realistic. His acting skills have actually improved. There is a scene when he forces out a smile toward the girl.Overall, I am very satisfied with Sicario: The Day of the Soldado.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

He also had that 555 number in there (what a douche) I mean it did have a hyphen in there, but still.

I was kinda hoping the cast from the previous movie to come back especially Emily Blunt.Kudos to Josh Brolin and Del Toro for delivering. Especially the scene where Del Toro was betrayed by those who gives him the order. And this sequel also, we can definitely see the soft side of the character Alejandro where he actually sympathise for the girl Isabella Reyes played by Isabella Moner.

I was a little disappointed too as I was watching, as it's not what it was sold as at all. But, in the eleventh hour it redeemed itself in a fashion. I think most people were under the impression that this sequel would finish the story off, but with the original being as good as it was, we have to face facts and accept that there's money to be made in another movie. Looking back I agree the plot is a little all over the place but that's not what these movies are about. They're about the grit of the dark and dirty underworld that is the Mexican cartels and everything that comes with it. I agree the trailers are basically click bait but don't take that out on the movie. Blame the studio for that. Dick move in my opinion. No excuse. However the action scenes are spot on, the politics are realistic and the acting is just perfect. Love it or hate it you'll find it gripping and suspenful till the end.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
331,biont,"Flawless in its dark, realistic atmosphere",10,6 July 2018,"If you love moderately paced realistic action, I mean not the kind of action where bullets fly of the main hero and all kinds of unbelievable nonsense is happening, but the kind of action, where you have the time to enjoy every scene and the plot is actually pretty believable - this is the one.I enjoyed every bit of it: from the atmosphere that doesn't really rush you, but doesn't bore you either. Nothing is too slow, and what is much more important, nothing is too fast - which is so common in action scenes. My respect to the video editor - he's done a marvelous job. The composer is also brilliant - the music is so dark, atmospheric and beautiful.And all the main characters in this play are lovable. I mean, the main studs are just so cool. They are like the definition of toughness. If you take guys like Rambo, Batman or Luke Skywalker - they are not even close to that definition cause of the unrealistic atmosphere. You know you're been tricked watching those too good to be true kind of guys. In this movie - it's pure joy to watch that manliness brought on screen.So, go watch it. I first thought: too many good reviews, those people aren't real, but I'll give it a try anyway. Now I realize it's actually a great piece of dark cinema. And that's the kind of cinema I usually enjoy the most. So, my thumbs are pointing up. Loved it and will definitely watch the next part, when it's out.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
332,akcsj,As good as the first one,9,24 October 2018,"The theme of the first Sicario was a principled but ultimate naïve character, Emily Blunt, dealing with the ruthless reality of drug and cultural clashes. In Soldado there are 2 young characters, Elijah Rodriguez and Isabela Moner who have to deal with tactics against the cartels and terrorists. Both are very good and while there is an element of setting up for a sequel in their predicaments their development and fates in the context of the movie are jarringly realistic. Both Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin replay their tough as nails roles and are superb. This is a gritty, well paced depiction of the underbelly of society.

336,ahmdpodcast,Better than the first one.,9,28 December 2019,I kept avoiding it because everyone kept talking about how the first one was better. For me the original Sicario was a 7 out of 10 so naturally I thought Sicario 2 would be much lower on my scale since everyone kept repeating the same thing about how its not as good as the first one however this movie was an intense ride and a great surprise! Much more memorable than the first one for me; I mean c'mon the UH-60's hovering above the road in the later half of the film; cinematography doesn't get better than that!

337,ewanbryce,Falls Short of the Original,6,28 December 2019,"Sicario 2 starts out strong, but loses itself along the way. For me, and perhaps I'm being too critical here, there was too much visual exposition as Josh Brolin and Bencio del Toro hop between Texas and Mexico. This feels like it was done to ratchet up the tension & to a degree it initially works, but Stefano Sollima fails to build on this tension in the way that Denis Villeneuve did with Sicario. Ultimately it feels like a replication of Villeneuve's signature technique of projecting isolation & suspense. Unfortunately Villeneuve Sollima is not. Near the end of the second act the plot loses its focus and momentum slightly, and you are oddly no longer concerned with Isabela Moner's character, but del Toro instead. This feels clunky & at odds with the plot. Despite this, Sicario 2 is watchable, if a tad turgid at times, however Brolin & del Toro deliver solid performances throughout, pulling you towards the story's conclusion. In many ways the film is a set-up for what one presumes to be another chapter in the Sicario story, however this installment failed to run with Villeneuve's baton.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
338,MikeyLikesIt_357,"Great acting, but a jumbled story",6,19 February 2019,"I had high hopes for this film as the first Sicario was fantastic. The movie seemed to even have a solid plot at first, but about a third of the way through they just drop it completely and take up a different theme. It's almost as if they changed directors or producers part way through filming and decided to just keep what they had at that point. There was great emphasis on starting a war between the cartels that ultimately went no where. They even focused on a mysterious character that they were watching via satellite and then you never hear about that character again.It's a shame, really, because Brolin, Del Toro and the other supporting cast really did a great job. It's just the story that was the weak point and unfortunately that can really drag down a movie.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

341,Fehrsho,"Sicario, re-painted.",7,4 September 2020,"The first 'Sicario' film was the kind of film we needed during the time it came out. As conflicts in Mexico were affecting the US, it gave us a glimpse into the human aspect of the drug war, and also gave us a lens to look at ourselves and our own morals through.In 'Sicario 2', we're introduced to a new threat: an influx of Islamic terrorism from Mexico.This time, we follow the perspectives of Alejandro and Graver, (Del Toro and Brolin, respectively) as they attempt to stir up a cartel war in Mexico. They take out a series of attacks before kidnapping the head-strong daughter of a cartel jefe, Isabel (Isabella Merced). The remainder of the film is trying to get the girl across the border, encountering a number of conflicts along the way. In the second half, she forms a slight bond with Alejandro, who saves her from being retaken by the cartel. By the end of the film, she watches Alejandro presumably get shot and killed, and is traumatized to the point of catatonia. However, Alejandro survives, and lives to find the young cartel kid that shot him, to take him under his wing as a Sicario in Training.
--
Once again, the film is written by Taylor Sheridan, and it shows. There's still a measure of careful humanity in the characters. However, I feel the story meanders from its start point. It uses Islamic terror as a leeway to the Mexico story, and then never gives it any attention. This could have been a story about kidnapping the cartel jefe's daughter, and Alejandro's conflict between the mission and his personal revenge, and it would've been more cohesive. I also feel he reminds us too much of Alejandro's past in the writing, as he reveals that Alejandro's family is dead, twice, through some forced exposition. Feels almost like Taylor was trying too hard to get us to relate to Alejandro, without simply letting his character breathe.On the flipside, Josh Brolin did -not- disappoint in portraying Graver again, however in this one, he reeks of desperation, and not the cool-headed operator that Graver was in Sic1.Again, the thrill has not left. This film is still an awesome watch, and it makes me excited to see what they can pull out of Sicario 3, if it ever comes to fruition. However, I feel Sheridan should invest a little more time into creating a natural flow to his story in the next one, and giving the characters more room to breathe. It could make for an excellent summation to the series, instead of being Sicario 1, repainted again.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

A kidnapping, a few killings, and a shot to the cheek later and it ends practically in the middle of a sentence. Acting is, of course, great. Especially Isabela Moner as the kidnappee. Del Toro, the man can do no wrong. It's the writing. Or lack thereof. If you're going to have a cartel war then have a cartel war. This is just the story of a single person being kidnapped.

A fun action movie to keep you on the edge of your seat. The story is different enough from mainstream to not feel annoying, and the film has a noble tone. The acting is superb, with Josh Brolin's performance being outshined by Benicio Del Toro's stellar acting. The cinematography feels fluid enough to mimic Deakins' touch from the first movie, and Day of the Soldado is an all around a good film.The Bad:
Sicario was a psychological thriller which is seemingly effortless because of how well Dennis Villanueva combined each aspect of the production, and that is where the second movie fails. Day of the Soldado is an honorable sequel, however it floats too close to the generic action movie edge, and makes it easier to spot plot holes. I liked it, but the movie was forced.

However as is usually the case with sequals - I believe this film seemed put together reckless . What MADE the first movie was Benecio's character which I believe Benecio himself was a perfect fit. Minimal lines just ""presence""..mysteriously handsome, mature but not too old..rough and tough but carried an almost childlike innocense to him that made him sexy where men and women alike were attracted to his ""essence""..this sequal didnt put him in the best like..they watered him down to be more an underdog then the masterful ""skilled columbian assasin"" he was in the first movie. They played up too much on his past that made him to ""normal"" for me. The other issue that ruined the movie for me was how they tried to play that delinquent, snot nosed, ""gang"" member wanna be - I do not believe he had any growing appeal to the audience on either side (good or bad)..he just came across as everyone's annoyance ..the snot nosed, spoiled rotten ""I hate the world"" look on his skinny ass - couldnt figure out why he was even in the movie. So scratching my head even more at the end..he was supposed to be another Benecio ? He looked NOTHING like Benecio nor could I place anything apparently glaring as to why he would be recruiting other than he tried to kill him to ""fit in"". In Benecio's case we never really learn what he did other than he was a prosecutor for the wrong people and they used his family to ""correct"" maybe a court verdict that went wrong? Obvious reasons for him to atleast understand where he is coming from..but not an angry teen who uses gangs to get what he wants. That and the last scene I couldnt relate to him/her at all as he appeared more a transvestite then future ""sicario""? i As much as I truly love Josh Brolin - this movie no exception he is fantastic..just unfortunately the story line and how they partner Brolin and Benecio didnt fit that well this time around. I think the story was disjointed, confusing..sloppy. The first movie..I couldnt get enough..every time I re watch it I learn something new..and felt the story line was very well thought out and scenes were incredibly powerful..this movie ..was too ""predictably stupid"" if you ask me.

363,TheZombieBehindYou,A sequel that surpasses the first,8,7 October 2018,"While Sicario was all about the dehumanization of war, Sicario: Day of the Soldado focuses on the horrors of war and how it affects children. Due to the shift in theme, a darker and more aggressive plot is allowed to exist without it feeling forced. The change of director doesn't really affect the film that much. It definitely still feels like the first Sicario and the director did a great job at attempting to replicate that. The cinematography is great and helps portray the plot in a more horrific way to help prevent it from being unwatchable. All of the performances are fantastic once again but the standout performance is definitely Benicio Del Toro (who better not be snubbed again) The score is still fantastic and the script is much more engaging and interesting. The only main flaws I have is the B plot and how it's resolved.This film was pretty great and overall it's a definite recommend, that is if you can handle some darker imagery and themes that might make some people squeamish. I can definitely see how this wouldn't be for everyone but it works as a hard hitting action film.

While the motive of the attackers is undisclosed until much later in the film, you aren't really concerned about that in the moment as the viewer. What you are concerned about is this: (1) why are the innocent civilians running past sets of open doors toward a further exit off screen. Doesn't make sense to run past two exits when your life hangs in the balance. More ludicrously: (2) why does the lady with the little girl try to inch past the praying man with the detonator when we've already been led to believe there is another (presumably safer) exit behind her?

Most of the action themed movies are full off idiotic jokes and cheesy lines these days but this movie presents realistic scenario, awesome tactical scenes and lines with austerity.People who complaining about violence in an action movie should stick to the harry potter series. If you are watching a movie about cartel wars do not expect people to throw snowballs each other.If you are done with bad action movies and looking for a highly enjoyable realistic action movie, this movie will make you satisfied.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
377,sportsnut-66935,Under appreciated sequel,8,28 July 2018,"Soldado is a solid follow up to the original. With Emily Blunt's absense, Del Toro and Brolin get increased screen time, and they carry the movie on their soldiers. The opening sequences are intense and hard to watch, and it's the overwhelming intensity that makes this movie one heck of a ride.Sollima does a solid job doing a Villeneuve impersonation. There is very similar cinematography making this movie feel like the first one, however it's a very different movie. The suspense of particular scenes is on par if not greater than the original. The action is turned up in this one and more brutal. This makes the movie it's own movie. I don't understand a lot of the negative reviews. It's a solid movie in its own right. Some people feel liked the ending was stupid and ruined the movie and too me, the ending is what make this an 8 instead of a 10. I think if they had changed it and a certain character stayed the way he was, it could have been an interesting take and shown true consequences for the life of a sicario, but then they couldn't set up a sequel. Positives-
Del freaking Toro
Increased screen time for Brolin. 
More great action scenes
Better story. 
Solid soundtrack
More stakes than the originalNegatives-

They are both very cool to watch and enjoyable if you are looking for something more serious to watch. Although, they both have the same negatives, they include stories that are not relevant enough. The first one was showing the life of the policemen who had NOTHING to do with the movie at all. This one showed the life of the boy who shot Benicio, sure he did a major thing, but he doesn't deserve that much screen time. I was going to give this a 7/10 but then the ENDING. After the boy shot Benicio, you should've just let him die. WHY??!! Why did you make him survive a point-blank shot through the mouth, then appear a few months later looking fabulous as if nothing happened. That's why I gave it a 6, it's so cliché.!",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
380,zenrgreen,"Unnecessary, Unwanted and Unfufilling",4,17 April 2019,"NON-SPOILER REVIEWLet's get this out of the way first. The first half hour of the film is amazing. The cinematography and direction is top notch, the acting is stellar and the film is tense and matches the grittiness of the first Sicario, albiet more military focused. A new threat is presented and is able to strike the United States where it hurts. This was really intriguing to me as not only was it a new threat instead of the Cartels but it was considerably more dangerous.This is where it fell apart however. The new threat I explained just then does not return for the rest of the film. It is never mentioned, nor does it show up or attack again. It's almost like it was never there in the first place. This is my number one complaint with this film. It took an interesting and dangerous adversary and just threw it out the window like it was nothing. Why they chose to do this, I don't know.
Along with this, the film devolves into a Call of Duty basically. Following a string of terrorist attacks, (suspected to be supported by the Cartels) the US Government just thinks like ""You know what? F__k it. Let's just send our special forces over into another country and do whatever we want! (Wouldn't be the first time though)"". Guns go ablaze, people die left right and centre, some even in broad daylight and that's basically the film.
In another scene, one character (supposedly) kills another only for the character who was shot to get up and drive away. The twist can be seen a mile away and I wasn't suprised when it happened.Overall, this film takes everything the first did and flips it upside down, devolving the dark and realistic thriller the first was and creating a sequel that was unnecessary, poorly written and utterly disappointing.4/10",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

383,malaway,"Nothing like its predecessor, unfortunately",6,13 March 2020,"While in itself, Sicario: Day of the Soldado is not a bad film - in fact it's a pretty solid action-thriller.
However, had it been a stand-alone film it would be alright.But since it is bearing the Sicario name - and officialy labeled a sequel - one has to compare it somewhat to the first film, which was pretty much flawless.Making a sequel and replacing the original director and cinematographer was the biggest mistake you could make.When you take away the the directing of Villeneuve and the cinematography of Deakins - the very strengths of the first film (along with the music score of course) - you no longer have the same magic of the first Sicario film.As a result, this sequel sadly falls under the generic Hollywood-action-thriller category - with bad dialogue, plot holes, a mess of a story at times and two poorly written (and acted) supporting characters.In contrast, Villeneuve's Sicario is close to perfect - so if you're a fan of the original, this sequel is not worth a watch.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Except for one minor thing:The story is awful. Who thought this was a worthy follow-up to Sicario?
Sicario was one of the best films I'd seen in years.Del Toro and Brolin at cross-purposes? Opponents? Really? Why? They were at their best working together.
You end up rooting for Del Toro, half-heartedly
But, you're left wondering why they're not teamed again fighting to bring down another larger adversary.To top everything off, Del Toro gets a headshot. Half of his brain is coming out of his skull. But...he wakes up. Gets to the truck somehow and drives away. And, then there's the final scene with the kid. Now, a total gangsta.What? This was the best idea? No one said this doesn't make sense? There's no one to cheer for. No one's going to believe he's alive from a head shot. And then drives himself to the hospital. And what happens there? It had to be reported. But, no worries. He's going to work with the kid to do whatever.

391,buzurg007,A good sequel with a glaring flaw that keeps it from being as good as the original,8,12 July 2018,"I am huge fan of Taylor Sheridan. Hell or High Water, Wind River, and Sicario are some of my favorite movies I have ever watched. The themes he explores are always complex, Sheridan never shies away from showcasing grey moral area, which is part of the reason why his movies are so gripping and unique to the point where they stick with you forever. Sicario: Day Of The Soldado was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, I was really scared for this movie, as first one didn't really seem like the kind of film that needs sequel. In the end, I was overall happy with what I got.Now, Sicario: Day Of The Soldado this time focuses more on Matt and Alejandro, played by phenomenal actors, Josh Brolin (who is having one hell of year) and Benicio Del Toro. Emily Blunt's character, Kate, is not in this one, and she doesn't really need to. The story is still centered around Cartel, but this time it's human trafficking and terrorism rather than drugs, so stakes are higher. Another prominent character in the movie is Isabel Reyes, daughter of a powerful crime lord, who is played by fantastic Isabella Moner. She seriously surprised me in the movie, her performance was powerful and gripping, and she managed to hold her own near freaking Benicio Del Toro, which is not an easy thing to do, especially for a young actress.So let's talk about positives - I absolutely loved what they did with Matt and continued to do Alejandro here. Alejandro was definitely highlight of the original film, every single time Benicio was on screen, I don't think anyone could take their eyes off of him, he's just such a unique and brilliantly written character, and he continues to be so in this movie. Benicio is just genius, his subtle acting is just brilliant, I can't stress enough how happy I am that he basically got his own franchise now. One scene in particular where he talks in sign language, is extremely well acted. Alejandro is just definition of unpredictable, I have zero idea what this character will do next, and it's just so unique to see the protagonist in the position where you would usually see a villain. Great character who continues to be great and complex.Matt Graver, who was a secondary character in the first film, moves to frontlines in this one, and it is great to see Brolin show off his talent in their full glory. Brolin just shines with charisma throughout the movie, and his character is explored even more deeply, which I loved. We delve into his relationship with Alejandro more, and it is showcased that they are not just co-workers, that there is sense of friendship, respect and experience there, and the actors portray it really well. There's particularly a short scene after Matt is tasked to take down Alejandro, and he is just walking into a car, but the amount of emotions Brolin shows just in that sequence is just incredible. I can with 100% certainty say that just like in previous movie, acting is Oscar worthy, but obviously Academy is just too damn stuck in their little box, and can't see anything further than that.Cinematography, while not as great as the original, is still brilliant, the same with directing, lighting, etc. Solima did a wonderful job in bringing his own unique style to a movie. This is very different movie than the original, and you can feel it right from the start. Especially the opening scene that sticks with you till the end.But there is a flaw that puts this movie below the original for me, and that flaw has to do with sequel baiting. Throughout the movie, there is a storyline of a kid who is getting into human trafficking, and while thematically his story fits, as it shows, just like in Isabela's case, the effect of war on children. Problem is that the story doesn't end. The story of the entire movie doesn't really have an ending, and it is not like open ending of original movie, this movie just cuts abruptly in the middle of the important moment. That ending really affected my overall feelings for the movie, and I had to think about it for days. It works great as a setup for another sequel, and I am sure that when third one comes out and if it will be great, my feelings for this storyline will change, but as of now, this hurts the flow of the movie.To sum it all, it was a really good sequel that is very close to being great one, but it doesn't quite reach that high because of that entire chunk of the movie and the ending. I am very excited for the third movie though.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Similar somewhat to War of the Worlds, the music conveyed this ever impending sense of doom, and most of that was preserved for the bad guys, which is always good.

403,tmashuk,Feeling ambivalent after watching the whopping 2 hour long movie.,7,24 September 2018,"The movie is fun with all that shooting. But the problem is the movie digressed so many times from what it actually wanted to prove that I am having an ambivalence emotion right now.First of, there could be another episode of this movie.Now, I did not understand what the point was for the terror attack on the US soil. Arab blowing things up on US soil has become a very common thing in the US movies. I mean it gives such an unpalatable message that I have a very hard time digesting. Military action film always takes a wild turn to the Middle East as if there is no good people there. As a result mass paranoia is engulfing natural sense of logic. Just painting a group of people as Arabs/Muslims has become good business for the film producers. They are feeding on the hysteria of the audience- a common fear that Arabs/Muslims are bad. I only wish people would start reading unbiased history of the world- starting from the Colonial periods.The second thing is the movie had a very great potential. Instead, the story teller wanted to put it through a metamorphosis and the end result was amorphous. To begin a turf war why would you need to retell a narrative where Arabs/Somalians had no function at all? Just to paint Arabs/Somalians/Muslims in another coat of black paint?The movie had a few good dialogues there. It really looked good and I thought yes! this could bring out the bad side of politics. Might bring out a few members of the clandestine society who choose what to do with the Humans of the world, who love to play GOD so much. But no, nothing of that sort at all.Then there was this one boy who had no introduction, just a few scenes, and WOW! the movie ends with him as if HE is the next BIG shot!!? What happened to the little girl?? What happened to the people who told the soldiers to turn against one of their own?So many unanswered questions.
It is like a first person shooter game gone bad.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
404,clueminati00,Non stop action,8,23 January 2019,From the first minutes this movie grabs you and doesn't let go. One of the best action movies I have seen in a long time.,Sicario - Day of the Soldado
405,chiponmashoulda,"A good follow up, should really be viewed in it's own merit, separate from the first film",8,1 July 2018,"Here's the thing. The original Sicario for me is about as perfect as a movie can be. One of my all time favorite movies. I have watched it several times, and I believe it to be a true work of art. Is this movie as good? Absolutely not. But is it worthy of being roasted by critics? I'd have to answer with an equally resounding no. Soldado is not really as much of a sequal as it is just another part of the Sicario anthology. The original Sicario was about American international policy in the facade of a drug movie. It was about the lengths the government was willing to go to deal with this war on drugs, the policies behind it and the individuals affected by putting those wheels into motion. Soldado, in that way is a similar movie. It also has a lot to say about American politics. What some people see as a pointless terrorism angle that was left behind for the movie to shift gears into a road journey is actually a key aspect of the film and does not take away from it, regardless of what political stance you have for border control. 
The terrorism angle: Initially, the movie starts off at the US-Mexico border with some migrants crossing. The border patrol closes in on them and one of the migrants diverges from the group; he has explosives and sets off a bomb, killing himself, and I believe to be several agents around him. The movie then flashes to another very graphic and well-done scene of 3 suicide bombers blowing up a super market in Kansas City. These events set the movie in motion since the Cartels are now labeled a terrorist organization based on the FBI definition that was given in the movie; basically, less rules in combatting them. One of the plans that Brolin's character hatches is to start a war between the cartels themselves, making a war between the U.S and all cartels in Mexico much more likely to succeed. The plan that they devise is to kidnap the daughter of one of the cartel leaders under the assumption that another cartel did it, and the events that transpire after involve the kidnapped girl herself, Del Toro's and Brolin's characters (and of course their mercenary compadres) as well as a side story about a teenage U.S citizen that starts to get more involved with the cartels eventually becoming a more integral part of the plot. One of people's major concerns with this film is that the terrorism angle in the beginning of the movie seems like scare tactics towards individuals who have a political inclination to close off the border. That could not be further from the truth. In fact, the movie makes it clear that the three terrorists that were involved were actually U.S citizens from New Jersey, therefore this theory they had that the terrorists came in from Mexico was completely caput. The overreach of the government to label the cartels a terrorist organization so they could continue their war on drugs is the point of this movie. Del Toro, Brolin, the kidnapped girl are all eventually seen as pawns on a chess board. When the mission is abandoned for yet again more political reasons, Brolin's character is told to dispose of the girl and Del Toro as they both know too much about the operation. This movie is not about the war on drugs, terrorism or border politics. It's about individuals being pawns on a chess board to government plans and policies, however ridiculous, immoral or unlikely to achieve a particular goal they might be. The movie does have substance, despite some critics stating the contrary. The direction and script are very good (what we've come to expect from Sheridan.) The cinematography and action sequences are spot on, as well as the sound and overall sense of dread that was captured in the first. My major gripe with the movie is the ending. This movie is too intelligent to bait us into a sequel. You put it out, I'll watch it, but please don't ruin a 2 hour long movie with a 1 minute sequence that basically winks at the camera for a sequel. Watch the movie, understanding that it is not as good as Sicario, but better than most of the crap that Hollywood peddles nowadays. If you like Sheridan's other movies, I'm sure this will be right up you alley.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

It felt like a great standalone, complete story. Therefore I was skeptical to the idea of a sequel. How wrong I turned out to be! This is a fantastic film! Soldado is to Sicario what Aliens is to Alien, Empire is to A New Hope and The Dark Knight is to Batman Begins. It takes these two great characters to a new place, always subverting your expectations as a viewer. Things never go as you might think. The action is tight, the filming excellent, the score on point, the acting great and the script suspenseful. What more can you ask for? I've already seen it twice in the theater. Equally brilliant both times! If they stick the landing with the third film, this will be the best trilogy since The Lord of the Rings.

416,ariwebbkatanos,Movie Review #6: Sicario: Day of the Soldado dir. Stefano Sollima,7,2 July 2018,"A preface: I know nothing of the development of this film, directorial or otherwise, so I won't be commenting on it. I'll just be reviewing the film.Anyway, Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a good film. Does it live up to the original film? Well, no. Sicario: Day of the Soldado generates it's decent quality almost entirely from drawing from its predecessor. It fails to add anything new or refreshing to the mix.The first half of the film showcases its worst assets. Poor use of aging contemporary politics and used up tropes made themselves prominent, as well as predictable plot points and acting. I took the most issues with some of the visual choices. Overall, the film tries to emulate the original's cinematic charm but instead falls into typical pitfalls that you'd expect from a generic action film.The plot starts out unnecessarily complex and only begins to straighten itself out towards the second half when I actually think it picked up quite well. It became less predictable as time went on, but overall the story's greatest flaw was its absolute lack of subtlety throughout.This is going to be a short review since I've been so busy with life but I'll get to the important stuff. Del Toro and Brolin both put on a good performance and have great chemistry onscreen, the rest of the cast mostly falls flat. Good thing those two are on screen for a majority of the film.You'll like this movie if you enjoyed Sicario more for the action, suspense, visuals (somewhat) and sound. It's an entertaining experience to watch and hear and has it's fair share of tight moments. However if you enjoyed Sicario more for it's characters, subtlety and creativity, then you might be sorely disappointed. Sicario: Day of the Soldado leans more to the overdone side of military/police drama and lacks a lot of the charm of the original film.Overall, it was worth the watch. Wasn't worth watching in Gold Class though, what a rip off. An additional $25 just to lay down, big deal. 7/10.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
417,stefanelectric,This is a Generic Thriller compared to the 1st.,1,13 July 2018,The First Sicario was epic and extremely suspenseful. It was set up more like a horror film in Mexico. This is a completely incomplete story that could have been told in a short. It only focuses on a bombing and the kidnapping of a girl . And it isn't really a drug movie . I would advise anyone to stay clear of this there are better cartel films on Netflix . And the ending is very rushed and incomplete. Leaving you with no resolution whatsoever. Its truly not all about Emily blunt this would have been terrible even with her in it. Its about Denis Villeneuve he needs to be brought back to oversee the project.,Sicario - Day of the Soldado
418,elijahcassidy,A Worthy Sequel,8,21 July 2018,"This is most certainly a different movie from it's predecessor. It trades in a slower build and commentary on the dehumanization of an individual for larger scope action and broader themes. This movie is admittedly not as well crafted as the first but yet again it's not easy coming on after Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins. But honestly in contrast to a lot of films we're seeing now it's still very well directed with visceral action scenes and a very tangible sense of tension.Benicio Del Toro is obviously very entertaining to watch as he was in the previous film however I felt that he wasn't AS interesting this time, maybe because of the lack of mystery. Don't get me wrong, still a great character and a great performance, but I think he's just that bit more of a captivating presence as a supporting character.The one big improvement from the previous is Josh Brolin. This fella is THE badass. He's got more screen time in this movie and you get a well rounded view of him when it comes to how he deals with authority, how he works in the field, and how he extracts what he wants. In these acts we see a very dark character who really doesn't mind becoming a necessary evil to bring about good at a cost (Much like Thanos...).So overall, I'd definitely recommend this movie, it's a much more complicated and bold story than the first with a lot of smart twists and turns and as a cinematic piece it stands up relatively well compared to the original.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
419,teschadwick,Rarely does a film supersede its predecessor but...,8,29 August 2019,"Rarely does a film supersede its predecessor but this did everything you'd want - if you got the first one. The first one wanted to show how hard it'd be to be a woman in a tough, male dominated DEA. This one just followed the DEA.
Brolin's character is let off the leash, del torro's is given free reign and the result it is a compelling thriller. Filled with violent episodes that question the application of such morals in your everyday life, it is the perfect film for boring men with no intention of doing such a thing.

This is just a number 2 totally useless. I never saw so many people going to the restrooms during a movie. The reason why is that movie is long and between two actions scenes, well, you just wait.The scenario is the big miss here. You can resume it as:1. Terrorists bomb himself in a US Store.
2. They investigate and found the cartels let them pass at the border.
3. Government decide to have a team to start a drug cartel war and eliminate one of the top drug cartel.
4. To do it, they decide to kidnap his daughter.
5. They kidnap the daughter.UP TO HERE EVERYTHING IS OK BUT SLOW6. Government says to stop the mission because corrupted cops have been killed.
7. The guy who kidnapped the daughter is alone in Mexico trying to get her to the border.
8. Drug cartel kills him.
9. The team kills the drug cartel.

Pace is plodding and entire thing is slow, slow, slow.
Music is like a mallet to the head - or eardrum ... hope you like bass cords.
Filler ... lots of filler, e.g. here are the cars driving along, here are actors staring at one another, here are vast desert spaces, here are automobiles gathering at a designated spot, here are helicopters thumping along (see their shadows?!).

439,Buzwardo,Cartel Convolutions,3,29 January 2019,"My goodness, what a mess of a movie this is. Suicide bombers are entering the US via the southern border hence DC types decide to let slip the dogs of war, who pretend to be members of one cartel kidnapping the daughter of another cartel to some unclear end because reasons. Said daughter is taken to Texas where a fake rescue puts her into the hands of the dogs of war who made it all happen in the first place who now, because reasons, embark to return her to Mexico.Alas, the Mexican police escort, because of more reasons, turn on the convoy they are escorting as our kidnapee escapes the ensuing melee, inspiring one of our dogs of war to strike off after her in an attempt to . . . return her to the US because yet more reasons.All these really quite violent keystone twists, as near as I can tell, are little more than very improbable excuses to set up the sequel's sequel, which will likely involve our erstwhile dog of war now abandoned by the US and shot in a bloody manner to seek vengeance against those who hung him out to dry because political reasons.The whole tale seems reversed engineered to leave the Del Toro character motivation to visit pain upon those who betrayed him in the same manner as he visited pain upon those cartel members who killed his family because plot twists can't just materialize all by themselves now; the need reasons because reasons, or so this flick suggests.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
440,allann-58424,Del Toro and Isabela Moner make a special combination that lifts Sicario lack of focus,10,26 October 2018,"Sicario tells the unflinching truth of many aspects of Mexican life. While its title can be misleading as the film is less about the focus on the boy who is initiated into what is less the life of a sicario but a human transporter across the Mexican-American border, while Sicario by definition is a drug cartels warders, the films strength is no doubt the relationship that develops between the teen daughter of the head of a drug cartel, and ironically the man whose family was killed by that same drug cartel. Instead of unleashing his anger, he tries protect and even as they progress in the cesspool of the Mexican nightmare civilisation, form a bond. The scriptwriter and director certainly didn't know where to focus in on this film, which is sad, as when they do culminate the film reaches levels as good as anything you will see. Brolin is a wasted character in this film, and I kept waiting for him to announce himself but the script had no ideas for his supporting role. His empty face by the end of the movie also does not tell you what he is thinking, and you feel an ending scene certainly between him and Del Toro, would give a climax the film needed. Overall Del Toro and Moner's display make this movie, this is superbly supported by one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a movie, it is quite menacing but also beautiful which symbolises the beauty of the cinematography and landscapes of New Mexico, the only problem as stated is and many willl feel this that sense of dread does not culminate in an ending sequence to propel why Brolin would just ditch his long time friend. Well respected critics suggest Brolin and Del Toro turned against each other, and that is not conceived in any form. If anything BrolIn's empty expression, is his regret he could not help his friend. And naturally as he flies away he knows failure of the mission will fall on his shoulders but he makes an act of atonement against his superiors orders at the end. Some suggest the lack of a conclusive ending suggests a third part in the Sicario tale. While I cannot fault the director, as his filming of beauty and blood, spearheaded by a constant cello i think is brilliant, he also drives the Del Toro and young Moner, who makes a fantastic debut that rather where most reviewers have focused on the shooting and explosions, and no doubt what would disturb Americans, the terrorist attack on a shopping mall, the director allows the mid section, to claim the film. it is unquestionably touching, as one can see how Moner's character development, framed so excellently, highlights the pointless destructiveness of not just people, but one's soul cradled by insight can make massive changes to an individual's psyche. Del toro as he seems always to do, in his quiet charm but wise, weathered eyes certainly should get more roles, but I was entertained visceraly and emotionally, and being tired of reviewers who trash movies and constantly make the same mundane comments, when all they doing is warming a seat will give this film 10/10, however, Taylor Sheridan, who has become some what overrated, fails to find a focal point in this film, there is either too much talent or too much string given to this writer, who kept Wind River focused and well paced, but received critical acclaim that was probably not so warranteed as Wind river, flows just as a very well directed movie and her script certainly wasn't a masterpiece. Here again Taylor relies on some excellent directing and acting. i would love a third part to make sense of the ending (a very common complaint viewers are having with movies these days, half the problem being some of these movies are now made in a month and clearly scriptwriters are not finding the time to write climactic endings, think of endings like in the movie Seven, it doesn't need a clever twist, it just needs to make the viewer feel ""wow"" that all came together). its worth a watch whatever your tastes.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

As a result, there is little time to show any characters in greater detail or even develop them. Then there is the timing and placement of events in the movie. A scene is shot at night because daytime makes no sense, but is followed by daytime scenes only to look good on the screen despite the fact that they should only be minutes apart. Characters cross the border with a lot of effort, but the reason remains unclear. Some decisions make no sense. Much of the movie is taking place just somewhere in the middle of nowhere and kind of ends up going nowhere as well.Despite all that disappointment I mentioned above, I'm thinking of seeing it again (something I rarely do), because it was visually good and it is not the usual predictable one man show other action movies tend to be.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The reason I gave this 7 stars rather than 8 or 9 is solely down to the ending, as in the very end. I could believe Alejandro could have survived being shot in the cheek, but what annoys me is the decision to show alejandro confronting the boy a year later, no explanation of whether he and Isabelle re united, or how he crossed the border.

Great action, great characters - both Brolin and DelToro are even better, cooler, more complex this time. And the rest of the cast are also spot on. To my surprise Emily Blunt is not missed a bit, everything works smoother without her.There is the usual communist/liberalist preaching that the US government is more evil than islamic terrorists, cartel thugs and violent people smugglers. But it cannot ruin the movie, it still works. A mix of Django, No Country for Old Man with some House of Cards.Tension remains high throughout. And when the story gets sloppier or confusing - the acting, action, sounds and cinematic vision pulls it off, a huge overperform!Don't bother trying to make sense of all the plot and message. 
Sicario 2 is more of a ride of excitement and violence in a land where only the toughest, the luckiest and those with some unerasable moral code have a chance to survive.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
469,mattlynch-37672,Riveting military style action-drama a stone's throw from its exhilarating predecessor.,7,10 August 2018,"In the wake of the bloody aftermath of 'Sicario' the narrative shifts in the direction of Josh Brolin's character Matt Graver. Known in the government for his carefree ability to carry out military dirty work on foreign soil with savage efficiency. On the endlessly grimy US-Mexican border, terrorists are being smuggled through to Texas hidden as immigrants. After a harrowing suicide-bomb attack tears through a shopping mall, the cartel is elevated to 'terrorist' status, freeing the military's ability to intervene on activities across the border. Matt is assigned to mitigate a war between the cartel leaders by feigning the kidnap of a leader's daughter. He again recruits an ever volatile and revenge driven Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) to aid in the undertaking of this dangerous and gritty mission. Following the monumental critical success of the first installment, 'Day of the Soldado' is poised for triumph. The first act is excellent, a chilling sequence of events introducing the buildup to the terror attack and subsequent reaction of the government. Filmed with military precision and establishing the ruthless 'no rules' attitude the characters are still willing to adopt. The action scenes are thrilling and realistic, bullet casings clanging off surfaces and distressing blood mists heighten the viewers immersion. Brolin and Del Toro turn in excellent performances as dogged soldiers with a complex balance of mutual respect and conflict of interest. Credit to Stefano Sollima for directing many gripping action sequences and an overall accomplished movie. Dariusz Wolski steps up from an accomplished portfolio to produce a pleasing visual landscape. Although both screenplays are written by the extraordinarily talented Taylor Sheridan, 'Day of the Soldado' suffers from some plot flaws and struggles to conclusively tie up loose ends. The particularly perplexing decision for Alejandro's character to abruptly deeply care for the captive Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner) doesn't seem to be an action that his character would make even in spite of his lost family. Furthermore, the government's unexpected decision to wipe clean the mission also appears to be a sudden change of events that doesn't quite hold up with the tempo. Unfortunately, the beautiful nuances dripping from every scene of the original aren't entirely successfully built upon (think - spellbinding 'bridge attack' and edge of the seat 'covert night assault'). The film certainly stands up to the original but suffers from the loss of Denis Villeneuve (Director), Rodger Deakins (Cinematography) and the late Jóhann Jóhannsson (Music). What this instead produces is an action movie rather than a seething complex drama. A great sequel which makes for a thrilling and captivating watch. Fortunately for audiences, 'Day of the Soldado' is the second installment in a proposed trilogy. ""So. You want to be a Sicario?"".
Overall: 7.5",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
470,siddharthkumar-23175,"Falls short of the original, but still a great film",7,28 June 2018,"Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a movie that clings on to the best elements of the original, but was not brave enough to try something new. The score, cinematography and the performances were spot on, keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats, however the story telling falls slightly short. Despite the writer being the same for the both the movies, this movie lacks cohesiveness as there is too much going on. Also unlike the first, with Emily Blunt's character, there is no one for the viewers to anchor to or walk them through the movie. Despite all that, there is still the same toughness and tension throughout the movie and the score was brilliant even without the late Johann Johannsson.

For him it is poetic, musical, gut-wrenching.So what is Day of the Soldado? For me it seems, quite the opposite. Yes, this is a worthy sequel; but is it a modern-day The Dark Knight? Let that question answer itself.Sollima executes this film fairly well, and it's certainly entertaining. But the original film is simply chock-full of tension-filled scenes. Soldado is almost like a montage of senseless destruction. Some scenes play off as reminiscent of Transformers.I think what Sollima was getting at, was something along the lines of tackling those very aspects. Perhaps it was the point to show this violence in an irreverent light. To show the ruthlessness of the United States, and Mexican gangs. Perhaps.

The initial scene of the movie really makes us thrilled by the horror as a result of the terrorist cruelty against innocent citizens.Josh Brolin has played a very good and stunning character for Matt Graver. We can feel the aura of terror, firmness and professionalism from Matt just by looking at body language and Josh Brolin's appearance. He really makes himself look very tough and ready to avenge the terrorist cruelty in a way that will satisfy us.Benicio Del Toro has also given the impression of revenge that is so scary that we can feel that the retaliation will be very appropriate with the cruelty of the terrorists themselves.The battle scenes between the military under Josh Brolin's leadership with the cartel members and with the evil Mexican police have been shown to be very realistic, cruel and frightening. Every splash of blood is seen as a cruelty on one side, but on the other hand satisfying.In movies like Rambo or James Bond, we see that the bullets and deaths of someone, especially the evil one, seem so easy and cheap. But in movies like Sicario, the death of a human really feels like a death that gives a sense of fear.I highly recommend you to watch this movie.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

482,leantom-95768,A Road to Nowhere,5,30 June 2018,"I had high expectations for the film. The first film in the series, simply dubbed ""Sicario,"" is a foray into the world of Mexican cartels and how those cartels influence U.S. border policy. It was packed with gritty realism (I believe the relevant genre is ""Western Realism"") and had a morally-complex, intriguing story whose conclusion came together rather nicely. This film, while following the same realism formula and also devoting itself to the complexity of U.S. immigration policy, feels somewhat pointless. That is, you're almost left shrugging your shoulders by the end of it, as if you've just watched a meandering sequence of events devoid of any moral lessons or finality.The story begins with U.S. Customs picking up a group of illegals who've just entered the U.S. While most of the illegals submit, one tries to make an escape and, upon seeing the futility of this task, winds up exploding himself (he's evidently an Arabic terrorist, judging by his appearance). Shortly thereafter, we're greeted with another scene of a suicide bombing at a Kansas supermarket. While the two incidents are not related (indeed, the terrorists who blew themselves up at the supermarket were apparently from New Jersey), the DOJ uses the two separate incidents as a pretext to declare Mexican cartels sponsors of terrorism, thus enabling it to engage in more militaristic (and morally questionable) interactions with said cartels. In come Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) and Matt Graber (Josh Brolin), two of the protagonists from the first film. The DOJ greenlights an operation allowing Graber and his men to start a war between two cartels by killing one of the cartel's lawyers and capturing the leader of that cartel's daughter, Isabel, and in the process framing the second cartel. They hold Isabel captive, all the while blind-folding her so that she doesn't know the real nature of her captors (the U.S. government). Unbeknownst to her, the government then stages a faux rescue operation to make it appear to her that she's just ben rescued by the U.S. government. With the war between the two cartels started, Graber and Alejandro lead a convoy back across the border with the intention of dropping off Isabel and letting come what may. This is where a problem arises.While delivering the ""cargo"", they're aided by the Mexican police. What they don't know, however, is that the Mexican police are on the payroll of the framed cartel (this isn't made known; it's just obvious from events that take place afterwards) and that this cartel is now REALLY trying to take the other cartel leader's daughter hostage. A fight ensues, but the corrupt police officers fail. In the scuffle, however, Isabel, fearing for her life, runs away unnoticed. This leads Alejandro to offer to track her down while Graber and his men get back across the border.In the aftermath of the attack, the DOJ decides to shutdown the entire operation given the potential for negative publicity and potential criminal prosecution (capturing a little girl to start a war between two Mexican cartels is apparently very illegal). This leads to the DOJ wanting to ""get rid of"" Isabel. While Alejandro reunites with Isabel, he refuses to execute her, instead opting to take her back into the U.S. across the border.And this is where the movie falls flat. The movie merely shows Alejandro and Isabel getting to the border and paying a cartel to get them back into the United States. Alejandro is recognized, however (a kid trafficking illegals apparently recognizes Alejandro as law enforcement), shot in the ""face"" (I say ""face"" and not ""head"" because he actually lives), and left for dead. The girl is then abducted by the opposing cartel, this time for real, and she travels with the cartel members until their convoy is located by Graber (Alejandro put a GPS tracking device on Isabel), whereupon her captors are executed. Rather than shoot Isabel, however, Graber decides to bring her back to the U.S. and put her in witness protection. The resuscitated Alejandro grabs a car and makes it back to the U.S., thus concluding the story.The climax is rather pitiful. As I said, there's really nothing suspenseful about the film; it's more a sequence of scenes than a coherent plot. Furthermore, there's absolutely no moral lesson taught by the film. If I could summarize: Girl kidnapped by U.S. government; U.S. government attempts to release girl in Mexico; plan fails and government agent gets girl back into U.S. And that's all. Again, it feels like a pointless endeavor.Sure, the film has the same gritty realism as the first. However, this actually appears to hamper the filmmakers' ability to tell a good story. By that, it appears that the filmmakers chose to focus more on a ""realistic"" story than a good one. This isn't to say that I don't like movies that dabble in realism; I rather liked the first Sicario. However, a movie shouldn't dabble in realism to the extent that it neglects to tell a good story.In conclusion, save your money. I wish I had.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

I haven't seen the first part but know that it is iconic in recent times prominently because of the passivity it maintains while filing the most gruesomely violent scenes and to look dispassionately at the darker sides of the special agents of the US who indulge in tactical and psychological warfare.
Roughly translated Sicario stands for hit men of the Cartels in Mexico and this movie is yet again a play on the obsessive American Mexican border infringement with Arab Terrorists added in the mix this time around.
Its gory it violent but it's also mesmerizing and makes for some serious watching made especially riveting coming at a time when there is already an American Mexican migration crises that is making International Headlines. Not a movie for your kids or even your Teens it can be seen easily as a standalone without there being any lapse in understanding.

490,jonahcybarra-29010,Everything is Gray,7,23 February 2019,"PROTECTION. COLLATERAL. WILL.Sicario: Day of the Soldado reunites audiences with the well-balanced duo of Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) and their drive to end the Mexican cartels and their cancerous existence. This film immediately throws the viewer into the action as it is revealed that the Mexican cartels have begun transporting Islamic terrorists over the border into the United States when a suicide bomber blows himself up before reaching the border. Kansas City is bombed, prompting swift and deadly retaliation from the United States' government. Hiring Graver to lead an operation that will turn the cartels' focus away from America and onto each other. Those watching are then privy to all that goes into planning a large scale operation that doesn't technically exist. Just as he did in the first film, Del Toro steals every scene he is in as he plays the grieving former prosecutor who has allowed his grief and quest for vengeance to shape him into a relentless machine hellbent on killing all of those responsible for his family's deaths. Brolin plays Graver more intensely than he did in Sicario, helping to convey the seriousness of the movie's plot. Written by one of Hollywood's best screenwriters Taylor Sheridan, Day of the Soldado focuses in on yet another aspect of the consequences of the drug trade and the violence that surrounds it; the children who suffer as collateral damage of the deadly, never-ending conflict. One of the most emotionally powerful scenes is when we learn that Alejandro's murdered daughter was deaf. As he discusses her it is apparent through the haunted, mournful look on his face that he is truly a broken man and that he clearly in part blames himself for her death. Graver decides that in order to create the chaos he is looking for, he and his team are going to kidnap the daughter of head of the Matamoras Cartel, Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner) and place the blame at the feet of a rival cartel. Another child, Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez) is the eldest son of Mexican immigrants living with the border fence in their backyard. The boy is groomed by his older friend and brought into the life of a coyote, smuggling illegal immigrants across the border into the United States. Sheridan and Italian director Stefano Sollima really drive home the idea that the deadly war being waged at the Southern border affects everyone, both young and old. When their Mexican Federal Police escort turn on them, Graver and Alejandro are forced to separate, the former returning to America with the latter being forced to track down Isabel who runs away during the firefight. Although at times she comes across as annoying, Isabel enjoys a well-written story arc, changing from a snobbish, petulant child to someone who not only realizes her father is evil but sees that evil firsthand. Sicario: Day of the Soldado takes a more gritty, more personal look at the violence that controls every day of those living along the border. The ending of the film sets up a third installment to complete the trilogy as Alejandro, surviving a nearly fatal gunshot to the face, confronts his would-be killer Miguel, further showcasing the character's unbreakable will and resolve to avenge the wrongs done to him and his family. Although it is a step down in terms of both directing, cinematography, and story depth, Sicario: Day of the Soldado more than makes up for these shortcomings with the stark look at the world's harsh reality and highlighting the fact that we live in a world of gray shadows, one where the idea of black-and-white morality simply cannot exist.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

493,mister-mike,Beyond stupid,1,27 July 2019,"The ending of this movie is idiotic (BIG SPOILERS).Benicio Del Toro's character gets shot, and it looks like he got shot very seriously, because when he miraculously recovers after the bad guys have left, there are what look like large bloody chunks of his scalp falling away from his head.Despite that, he managed to somehow survive death (or the appearance of death, which meant that no one shot him more than once) and gets up and somehow leaves the area where he was left for dead.The bad guys have all gone, presumably some time before, because it was dark out when Del Toro got shot and when the good guys (Josh Brolin, etc.) in helicopters confront all the bad guys on the road and kill them all, it is daytime.So how many minutes or hours is it from the time Del Toro is shot until these guys are all killed? Del Toro manages to seemingly WALK from the place where he was shot to where the bad guys are all dead. I estimate this could be a VERY long way, like what ... 10, 20, 50 miles or more?Del Toro then takes over one of the bad guys' cars and manages to drive back to the border and the USA. It is amazing that no one seemingly thinks there is something weird about this at the border, considering he has lost enough of his scalp to probably cause brain damage and does not (as far as I know) have a passport to identify himself, because he was pretending to be a poor Mexican who was going to be smuggled over the border.I read through several of the reviews of the show here at IMDB. NONE of the reviews I read mentioned the above stupidities!!At the end of the show, back in the USA and some time later, Del Toro meets the kid who shot him in the back room of some place. Del Toro seems to be relatively OK!The scene where the drug kingpin's daughter escapes and runs into the desert is also very dumb. Del Toro says he will go after her and find her, because Brolin and his pals have to get back to the good old USA, where poop flies because of the ""international incident"" which resulted. I dunno how far away the daughter got from him. Despite this, with the skill of an ""Indian tracker,"" he manages to locate her and the two of them trudge across miles and miles of desert to the home of this mute dude who helps them on their journey.The ""extra features"" on this DVD are pretty funny.

494,madandy84,Decent follow-up,7,22 September 2018,"The first Sicario was one of my favourite movies of 2015 and whilst this is a fairly solid follow up, it does not have the directing proficiency of Denis Villeneuve, nor the amazing cinematography of Roger Deakins. I was excited that Taylor Sheridan was the writer of this one, as he was the first movie and I did like the basic premise the movie is based on i.e a mission gone bad and the efforts to rectify this. I just felt that tonally, it was a completely different movie. Where the first movie was extremely suspenseful and at times genuinely terrifying, this felt more of a straight up action movie. There are definitely some tense moments in it but they seem more hurried, compared with, for example, the border traffic jam scene in the first one, which builds to its climax over a good 10 minutes.Despite its shortcomings, this is still a pretty decent action film in its own right. If you like your action movies gritty and nasty with a good dose of explosions and gun fire, this is definitely for you. Just don't expect the same edge of your seat, nail shredding suspense you got from the first one.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
495,HenryChampion,"Soldado: Darker and bloodier, but not a triumphant successor",7,30 June 2018,"As a stand-alone film, Sicario: Soldado succeeds as a tense and brutal action-drama situated on the US-Mexican border and beyond. As a sequel, it ventures into even darker territory than the original, but falls short of its predecessor's intellectual depth and moral examinations. Soldado is riveting from start to finish; but unlike Sicario, this latest film has little interest in asking big questions like 'Is this a just war?' Thoughtful queries have been replaced with one simple rebuttal: Keep the war clean. The tight narrative direction leads to missed opportunities for real substance. Soldado lacks the compelling push-pull of Kate Macer's (Emily Blunt) idealism and acquiescence juxtaposed with Matt Graver's (Josh Brolin) machismo and amorality. Clearly there are ""no rules"" this time around and it inadvertently leaves the story a bit hollow. Fortunately, Benecio del Toro brings his grit once again as Alejandro Gillick with his character's clandestine and surprisingly compassionate disposition. Whatever depth may have been lost with Graver (Brolin) was still retained with Gillick in his attempts to cling to humanity. Soldado is an engaging two hour journey to parts unknown - unforgiving and unapologetic - and that's enough to call it a good film. Sequels can't escape expectations though. With this sequel, you'll be amiss to expect any real thematic underpinnings or cerebral stimulation.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
496,kadajawi,Throws logic out of the window,6,19 July 2018,"Let me start by saying that yes, the movie emulates the first one pretty well. It has the atmosphere, the look (sort of), the soundtrack etc. of the first one. And the actors are good, too.The plot starts well enough, and the plan of having this top secret mission of starting a war sounds much like what the CIA would do, and how they may go about it. Wonderful. But then it falls apart. So, the girl is brought to a military base? WHY? Couldn't she have been brought some place in Mexico, which seems more realistic considering what was going on? Why would the cartel kidnapping her bring her to the US? But ok, I'll go along with it. When they returned her to Mexico, it was an official military mission. And corrupt cops then attacked the American soldiers. The only mistake I see, one I don't think the CIA realized, is to have her be kidnapped by the same people rescuing her. It seemed like she noticed something. But other than that? Which part of this wouldn't be easy to sell to the public, if need be? It's the bloody CIA, and they can't spin it?Say that the girl was discovered being kidnapped by a cartel. They wanted to return her to Mexico, in a joint mission with the Mexican police (I doubt it was a top secret mission anyway since the police was involved?). There, corrupt cops attacked US soldiers. (How is that not a great reason for the US to get officially involved and bomb cartels in Mexico?!). How on earth did the CIA fail to spin this, and instead do ridiculously stupid things like trying to eliminate a very valuable asset? Sure, all grieving fathers (of which there are many) are super soldiers/spies/hitmen. Right. It's unrealistic enough that a lawyer is someone who makes Jason Bourne seem realistic. But then saying someone like that isn't valuable, and should be eliminated for a dumb reason? Absolutely something the CIA would do.Anyway, it is a silly trope you have in many movies, and it doesn't help any of them. Kill the super soldier because he knows too much. And then he'll fight back, and kill everyone involved, whereas if they had left him alone, the secret would have stayed exactly that, and no one would have gotten hurt.And then there are goofs like the missing headrests, which are really obvious, or them driving for 15 minutes (from night to day...) and ending up roughly 50 meters from the place they started from. REALLY?! What a coincidence...So, yes, it is a fun movie, but please turn off your brain while watching, and please stop saying it was realistic. The CIA can't be this incompetent.

Is that the point perhaps? Is it meant as satire, poking a little fun at the first one? I don't think so. It just sucked. I don't get what people are seeing calling this an 8.0 or a 9.0. (that the rating range of The Godfather btw!!!). Sequels are nearly always exceedingly weak - this one lived up to that.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The plot is full of twists but there are a few that are predictable. This movie was almost perfect until the end. I feel the directors could have left the last five minutes for the beginning of a sequal rather choosing to cut to black after Josh Brolins last scene then leaving a mexico cliff hanger scene in the credits.

AND THEN HE SURVIVE THE SHOT TO THE HEAD. WHY? Because bullet passed though his cheeks? Are you serious? Who thought of this? A 3 year old kid?

Films like this can't compete with really good TV Dramas out today. They don't provide room for deep character development or a story to care about. We don't get enough films today like Shawshank Redemption that has a great beginning, middle, and end with lots of story and character development throughout it's run time. I didn't care for the original Sicario much but this one is worse in that it really doesn't seem to have any purpose. There's no buildup, or payoff. The goals are vague and nothing really gets accomplished.
 The directing is great, gunfights are well done, and superb acting all around but it just isn't meaningful or memorable in any way. It seems like the first episode of a good war on drugs series but we know there's not going to be another episode so there's no real reason to get invested in any of the characters thus making the 1.5 hours pretty much a waste of time that could be better invested in something more complete. It also didn't make a lot of sense. We are left with far too many unanswered questions but at the same time, you won't really care about having them answered.

There's very little (boring) action, it's about as brilliant as the bottom of a ten-year-old frying pan, and it's actually *less* realistic than Team America.Perhaps if they'd spent more of their budget on the story and the script, rather than spending far too much of it on trying to pump up its IMDB score with fake votes and reviews, it could have been watchable.And for the music, they could maybe have afforded a real composer, who knows how to write real music, rather than the amateurish dystopian-future sci-fi/horror flick ""noises"" (it sure ain't music!) that you're subjected to.Don't be conned by the wumao chorus.

Probably not. Is it unmissable? Surely not. But it's still great entertainment, and great cinema.The only flaws come mainly from the premise, particularly the motivation for the storyline, which turns out to be... Djihadism, in a story that deals with drug cartels and smugglers. The subject of terrorism is completely absent after the first 15 minutes of the film, which leads me to think that it was added at the last minute to satisfy the need to make an echo to America's main concern today.

That said though, like it's predecessor, this movie is a *MUST WATCH in my books, so much about this movie is a master of it's class. The storytelling, the story & character writing and execution and in turn the world building, the acting and of course, it's cinematography. Something else to praise is it's balls to not shy away from jarring violence and that is also helped by the Effects. Truly a movie everyone must watch before they die.

Well done to the editing team on that feat.There are three story arcs in this, with tenuous (almost implorsable) connections at best.1. Tracking terrorists coming in through the Mexican borders with the help of African drug lords and Mexican people traffickers (which it turns out wasn't the case at all, in an almost glossed over plot twist), with a plan for American retribution.2. A war strategy that would see all the Mexican cartels fighting each other, which is almost immediately abandoned on day one, even though the Gov't has give the green light to go full 'dirty' just moments earlier.3. A pointless/ill conceived/stupid child kidnapping that goes nowhere, and sees the kidnapped child's father try to murder everyone involved (including his own daughter who was about to be returned unharmed).Sub-plot, a borderlands American/Mexican kid who we don't care about trying to make a few dollars.Acting = Flawless (except the kids actors).
Plot = Pointless
Film = PointlessSummary: To call this Sicario 2 is like saying 'Cloverfield Paradox' is part of Cloverfield. Sicario 2 is a trailer for Sicario 3, which if I'm being honest, if it's made, I'll wait to watch on TV, for free.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

This movie stands on its own, has the familiarity of the original and the same out of the seat action and suspense. I think with a slightly broader view/perspective it would have been as good as the original.

First one was slow, tense, a small but depth plot with Villeneuve touch.This one is more action packed, more complex script, less tense. Direction is not bad keeping the feel of the first one.The script is more complex but never assume it's direction. Islamic terror, people trafficking, young wannabe sicario, cartel wars, kidnapping, soldier with no moral, soldier with heart, government that go dirty, not dirty and the list go on. They can't even fully decide the fate of their character.In the end this movie end up being predictable with no surprise, or great message, but it is still a well made action packed movie.10/10 is a bit too much.

The burnt tinge of Sicario brought the brilliant landscapes of the southwest right off the screen, while the shades of Soldado were just okay; it was like the different looks of Albuquerque in Breaking Bad vs. In Plain Sight.The main thing that made the first film work was that we saw it through the eyes of Emily Blount's character, an almost-conventional FBI Agent suddenly caught up in a different, fewer-rules set of tactics run by guys who, well, had fewer rules. As that character, or anything like her, was missing in Soldado, it was lifting the veil of secrecy and mystery. I much preferred the ""who ARE these guys?"" plot of the first film to the complete demystification of Soldado.Overall it was a completely different film, linked to the first only by the occasional repetition of the penultimate, subliminal roar of the score (which wasn't bad), kind of like playing the ""Jaws"" theme during ""Orca"" and hoping we didn't notice...",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The plot scope includes pirates from Yemen, terrorists from the middle east (and the U.S.!), a Colombian sicario (of course), Mexican drug cartels and the United States government with its CIA and DEA and Border Patrol foot soldiers. Realistic Violence
When the first film showed, I had tried to get my girlfriend at that time to watch it with me. She couldn't. She's a Colombian journalist who over the course of her career has worked directly with victims of Colombia's armed conflict. She had been through dicey situations and her work with the victims brought her face-to-face with worse. The violence depicted in that first Sicario movie was too real, to close to life for her. Not what she considered Friday night entertainment. We rented Hotel Transylvania instead.As a sheltered American, on the other hand, on-screen violence, even real, gritty, dirty ugly and dark violence, still appeals to my sense of fantasy, adventure and vicarious wannabeism. Meaning, I wanna be that dark, brooding hero or anti-hero. And if automatic weapons lock and load, sign me up. Anyway, I managed to get a date for the sequel. The movie is violent, gritty and ostensibly real, maybe too real for Hollywood fare. I enjoyed watching the Sicario: Day of the Soldado even more than the first one. Maybe I shouldn't have. Or maybe I think I'm learning about the world through these movies. I know, I'm naïve.Sicario, the Man and the Word
The main character, el Sicario, played by Benicio Del Toro, is Colombian. He was originally an attorney prosecuting drug lords. He's turned into an assassin who seeks vengeance because a drug lord gruesomely murdered his wife and daughter. While the first movie just showed the character as the weapon he had been turned into, the second movie puts him to task and shows he still has a conscious.The word Sicario has a special place in Colombian vernacular. It means more than just hitman or assassin. It paints the picture of a specific type of hitman, one specifically tied to the world of cartels and drugs, and a decided lack of future. Purposeful Entertainment
Sicario: Day of the Soldado is entertainment with a message. It shows the complications and consequences of actions taken by all sides of a non-linear, unbalanced equation. Hopefully this dirty, messy, gritty, ugly truth is in Colombia's past to stay and soon will be in Mexico's past.The movie got me thinking a lot about Mexico because I'm going to be traveling through the country soon. (More on that in the coming weeks.) Ensuring my trip is safe is an important part of my planning. One friend of mine has already expressed her horror at my plans and has quite vehemently stated that under no circumstances should I drive through Mexico. Interestingly enough she (an American) lives there. ""So, it's okay for you to live there, but I can't drive through?"" She backed off her stance when I pointed out that lack of coherency.Sicario made me think about the United States too. Specifically, about the current U.S. presidential administration's policy against immigration and its way of dealing with border control. No one's right, everyone's guilty of some wrong.Gritty Reflection
The movie can be considered a mirror. But of course, no one wants to look at an ugly reflection just because there's truth. The thing still has to entertain. After all, it is a movie. Sicario's story engages. Think if it as an ugly reflection you won't be able to turn away from. In an interview, Benicio Del Toro, along with his co-star Josh Brolin, who plays CIA operative Matt Graver, described the plot as a basketball game that goes into double or triple overtime. You're never sure who's wining or even who wins in the end. I use the analogy of a hard look at an ugly reflection because, especially toward the end of the film, the camera moves in close on the characters' faces. We're put inside their heads as they grapple with what they have to do or what they've just done. Those long closeups are accompanied by a haunting soundtrack. The music is the auditory equivalent of the dark abyss the two main characters dive into and then must climb out of. The viewer remains in doubt as to whether or not the characters succeed in their escape.More on the Violence
A final note on the violence. My date for this sequel was another Colombian woman. When the movie ended, I asked her specifically what she thought of the violence. She had made it through the 122 minutes and I hadn't noticed her squirming. She shrugged. The violence didn't bother her. She added that it was familiar. That's not a good thing either, but it's understandable. She's from a not too great neighborhood in Medellín, the city that just 20 years ago was listed as one of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world. I recommend seeing Sicario: Day of the Soldado, unless you're like my ex-girlfriend who has lived violence first-hand. If that's the case, go see the latest offering by Disney.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Even the scene in Bogota Colombia it is very evident that they filmed in Mexico City, at least they could covered some aspects in order to make it not so evident .

It's a satisfying story bridge to what i believe will lead us into a third Sicario film in the not so distant future. I loved the first Sicario. So many wonderful story telling elements. Benicio is such a talent. This sequel to the original carried its own weight. To those persons giving low ratings, I say please disregard their negativity. There is no real logic in their comparison of the two films. Characters need to shift MO to create a story arc. In life, we are all constantly changing our pursuits and practice of who we are striving to be. It's only logical that the Alejandro character would return to a warmer, less black and white mentality as the years pass from his initial loathing and trauma having his family be murdered by Reyes. For Day of the Soldado, I give high points for the musical score and sound design, the immensely powerful performance from Benicio (I can not believe he wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe on this one) and for the amazing cinematography, lots of unique and beautiful choices in that arena.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Anyways, the first half of this movie was literally amazing! I mean I honestly believed this would turn out to be my favorite movie of all time - that's how good it started. You could tell they were rushing the timeline, but I ignored that because I thought they were leaving space for something great. Unfortunately, they were not and only building up to a HUGE let down that feels like a writing failure to me. The story line just sucked with a huge twist in the plot roughly half way through that I don't think anyone liked. They should have kept it about counter terrorism and this movie would have lived up to its promise. To be fair, the actors all did a phenomenal job (with the exception of the guy who played SECDEF), but they were cheated by a shi*ty story and an even worse ending.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

573,knoxsw,"An Awful, Misguided Sequel Cashing in on A Turbulent Political Climate",2,11 October 2020,"This film, which I wanted so badly to be good, is awful. I loved the talent behind it, Solimma's work in Italian film and TV is compelling and intricate and Taylor Sheridan is proving to be one of the best screenwriters of the 21st century, but the sum of it's parts is less than all that. The film not only tips its hat in the opening sequence, but the trailer as well. Instead of the complex and meaningful criticism of the drug war and the complicity those that claim to fight it. This movie trades that for a weak, misguided and offensive stereotypical plot cashing in on the heightened fear of immigrants in America at the moment. The core tenet being that these cartels are now smuggling Muslims into this country so they can commit terrorist acts, echoing the narratives of migrant caravans driving evil Muslims into this country that you see in the news. This is not only patently untrue, but serves the story in no real meaningful way. The first scene, at a grocery store in Kansas City, illustrates the attitudes towards Muslims this film has. A terrorist, having been smuggled to the US by cartels decided to bomb your average grocery store. He walks in and says a prayer and then looks a mother and baby in the eyes as they plea for him to let them go and kills them anyways. Within those moments, it was clear this movie would go no deeper than just using Muslims as television and film did native americans: prop stand ins for evil and soullessness. There are good movies with flawed attitudes that can be overlooked because they strike at something intricately or hold historical value, but this movie does no more than insult an entire faith and cash in on the fear of immigrants. Taylor Sheridan can do better, Wind River proves as much. Avoid this movie as it only serves to harm instead of entertain, engage or provide insight into human experience.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The amazing suspenseful audio production of the first film was 'I feel' replicated a bit too much on this follow up. At times it seemed like the same signature audio riff was played on a loop for over 20 mins. 
That aside, very enjoyable crime thriller with 2 top notch lead actors. Brolin has come of age over the last decade and leads a film very well. Accompanied by the established, Benicio Del Toro, who to be honest..... makes this film what it is, results in a very suspenseful and dramatic film written by Taylor Sheridan who is quickly making a name for himself in terms of screenplay writing",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

It sums up why the first movie was a masterpiece and why this movie is a masterpiece!Considering the fact that this genre is full of cliches , poor scripts , etc, nobody really expected that scene. If Sicario was your average Crime/Drama film Alejandro would either be saved by Matt or it would turn out that the man who ''died'' was not actually Alejandro.This movie embraces Realism and that is the main reason why i love it.

The premise of the movie - a poorly conceived device to locate the characters in a new drug war courtesy of the US administration- is quickly shelved .

577,chris-07986,Confusing and miss leading opening scenes,3,4 July 2018,"I'm a relatively intelligent soul and I was really looking forward to this film having watched the first several times. The opening scenes give the viewer the impression the film is going to be packed full of action, with quotes indicating that things will ""get dirty"". However, the only thrilling or shocking scene is during the first 15 minutes or so at beginning. The viewer is led into a confusing plot, is it about terrorists is it about trafficking or drugs? Is it about political agendas? A disappointing outcome in my opinion as the film didn't deliver anywhere near as gritty storyline of the first film. The actors seemed tired and had little energy. From the opening scenes one would be led to believe we will be treated to an action packed film but this wasn't the case. The story was a little confusing, trafficking drugs, gang war or politics it was hard to tell.

There were random Muslim, Somali ""bad guy"" characters (like the ones who bombed a grocery store) who seemingly had nothing to do with the rest of the action and were never mentioned again, which just added more confusion to the already indistinguishable storyline. It was filmed nicely, great cinematography and camera angles. But there was actually no plot. I was lost the entire time. Basically, to summarize: terrorism, DEA starts drug war by kidnapping a kingpins daughter, people die, nothing is resolved.If you like mindless action, go watch something where half the time isn't spent talking about nonsense and throwing around keyword to make it seem like something is going on.

582,lopeznathan,Was not what I expected it to be.,7,29 June 2018,"Soldado is a sequel that I didn't really ask for, but was interested in seeing anyways. This was directed by film newcomer, Stefano Sollima, and written yet again by Taylor Sheridan. Sollima does a fairly fine job in place of Mr. Villeneuve. This film is directed well I would say, but with some drawbacks that'll be explained further. Also on this project is frequent Ridley Scott collaborator Dariusz Wolski as DP. It's shot very differently compared to Deakins' way of work on Sicario, but Wolski and Sollima find their niche and manage to pull it off. For the most part, I was quite surprised to see how well Sollima actually directed this film, being that he's from more of a television background. The tension is rife yet again, and as with the first film I found it hard for myself to take my eyes off the screen. The action scenes were well paced, and none of it felt like it was written just for action's sake. Safe to say I was completely immersed for the whole two hours. Del Toro and Brolin are excellent, and played their roles as expected. Everyone else played their roles rather fine. Now, for the negatives. I for one did not really like how this film was edited, and written in some places. Going back and fourth between certain characters works well when done for a specific structural goal and reason (Dunkirk) other than to just ultimately tease a sequel. It felt like some elements of the story could have been told and re-worked in better fashion. Now for my huge, and major gripe with this film. The ending, or the last 25 minutes I should say. In fact, before the last moments of the film, I was actually starting to believe that this would rival the original. That it would be as good, or hell, maybe even a bit better if they had the balls to pull something like that off. But nope, it's just what you don't want to expect. Poorly written and thought out sequel bait. That really was a low blow in my opinion. All in all, Soldado is a film that succeeds in a general sense, from the same great tonal style present in the first entry. It falls flat in areas of writing and execution.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

This one just lacks the same integrity, fails to explain motivations, and the plot does not fit in. Like, who were ""corrupt policemen"" too attack Americans? Why they did so? Why she run away? Why one want to reinforce cartel war, if it is already there? And, why ""killing the king"" is not an option anymore, if this is exactly, who you did in a previous movie, and it felt quite right? Why the main protaganist would not kill a girl (I mean, you can motivate it, ut it just against the character and what the first movie tells us about him)?

The original Sicario was number 1 on that list. (Keep in mind that was the same year as Star Wars return, inside out, creed, and the revenant.... a good year for movies) Del Toro and Brolin were great in the first one and did a great job in this one too! But the story just didn't do it for me. Like others said, the movie would begin going in a direction at times, then completely abandon where it was going. I think if I saw this movie without my love for the first one I would have appreciated it more, but it just fell too too too short. I hope that when the third comes out it continues from the paths started in this film and gives the story I believe most movie goers will be expecting with this one.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Going in I wasn't sure that I necessarily needed a sequel as the first film tells a pretty complete story but I suspect there was money to be made and so here we are.The first 2/3rds or so is a fairly good imitation of the original.. it's not as good but it's serviceable. There are a few instances where characters do not act consistently with their portrayals in the first film, but it is still entertaining on some level. The last 3rd of the film however, is a complete mess. Not only are there plot holes and/or characters doing nonsensical things only because the plots needs them to do it.. most troublesome is the technical problems.Several scenes are laid out in such a way that it's difficult to discern when or where they take place within the narrative. Are these scenes happening at the same time or is this the next day? Hard to tell. Are these characters miles apart or only a few feet? We are given conflicting information. Helicopters are ""5 minutes out"" yet it seemingly takes hours for them to arrive? What?Overall its OK but the ending is really a mess. There's also a few subplots that seem to add little to the overall plot. If you enjoyed the first one you might find something here but don't expect the same experience as the original.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
586,austindharrison,A grim tale that holds no punches,8,3 July 2018,"I love Denis Villeneuve as a film maker. He directed the first Sicario from screenwriter Taylor Sheridan, and it is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. Though Denis Villeneuve did not return to direct Sicario: Day of the Soldado, Taylor Sheridan returns as the screenwriter.The film's premise is a bit more complicated than the first. The film's opening is a harrowing and brutal terrorist attack in a Kansas City grocery store. We find out the terrorists were smuggled up from Mexico, so the United States Government enlists Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to round up a team to go to Mexico, and start a drug-cartel war by killing and kidnapping prominent cartel members and making them look like rival cartels are responsible.Also returning from the first Sicario is hit-man Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro.) Matt hires Alejandro to help his team kidnap the daughter (Isabel) of the most prominent drug lord kingpin, Carlos Reyes. The plan falls through and Alejandro is left attempting to get himself and Isabel safely back over the American border. While this is taking place, there's also a side story of a young boy named Miguel who lives in a small Texas town near the Mexican border. He becomes involved in the migrant smuggling business, and his tale eventually clashes with our anti-hero Alejandro.The action sequences are shot competently, with some very creative one-takes that make you feel like you're there with the characters. The cinematography was very well done, though I feel the film makers went a little overboard with the color-correction, especially with bright sun-filled scenes in the Mexican deserts. There wasn't a lot of color or anything that made any scene really pop, and I understand why. The film is supposed to be an ugly story, but I personally would have preferred a bit less brown and grey-scale in many scenes. The acting was fantastic, especially from Isabela Moner (Isabel.) Every scene she was in she stole the screen, but unfortunately towards the end of the film she is given less and less to do, despite how smart her character was earlier in the movie. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are once again terrific, and it's nice to see Benicio with a film series he can really call his own.Day of the Soldado holds absolutely no punches in this grim tale involving the unfortunate reality of so many living near Texas and Mexico. The people involved in the smuggling of migrants, the governments trying to contain it, and the children that eventually become part of the entire process makes watching Soldado a tough pill to swallow. This is not a film meant to entertain us, it's meant to highlight and showcase the realities of what humans will do to survive, and what governments will do to protect their assets and profits at any cost. The cost in this case being the underage kids and teenagers that get all mixed up in the adult proxy wars. The violence is intense, the themes are dark, but with a story that highlights the similarities of what is happening today in the United States and Mexico, I feel it is an important viewing experience. We always seem to forget that during times of intense crisis, the ones who always lose in the end are the kids and teenagers who have no power or say in anything.I'm giving Sicario: Day of the Soldado 8/10.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

597,vaanytashukla,A Disappointing follow-up,3,5 July 2020,"*SpoilersAhead'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' starts with a distinct look and distinguishes itself from it's predecessor, right from the get-go. With visuals and colours setting the tone of the film we're about to see, we are put right in the middle of the action. It features Benicio Del Toro playing the silent hit-man Alejandro and Josh Brolin playing Matt Graver.I had been very patient with this film right up until it had 15 minutes left. It was disappointing, to see the treatment of some, brilliant and mysterious characters.
Alejandro was treated with a startling lack of dignity. We know how ruthless his character is, and how brutal he can be. Yet here, all that mystery and dread looming over him is stripped away to reveal nothing. He is reduced to a pawn, used to further a plot which in itself isn't nearly as gripping. The ""surprise reveal"" of the fate of his character is not only lousy, but is something which is unbecoming of the character himself. and demeaning to the myth surrounding him.The movie in and of itself doesn't quite know what it wants to be. A thriller? An action flick? A suspense? All of this leads to the film taking on attributes of all these, and leaves it feeling patchy.
Speaking for myself, I was not thrilled at any point in the film, and was often looking at the time. Even with performers are powerful as Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro, the film leaves much to be desired and left me feeling unsatisfied and subsequently outraged.
The film started off, knowing where it would go, but lost track of it's destination soon after.
Characters came and went, as and when the plot needed to progress. I felt certain characters, were underdeveloped as well, namely Cynthia Foards played by Catherine Keener. The side-stories seemed kind of forced. The film relied on explosions to elicit excitement or shock from the viewer, and chose scale over story.I tried my very best not to compare this film to it's predecessor 'Sicario' (2015), however, I couldn't help but notice just how effective the first film is, at telling a story which makes you care for the characters and at the same time thrills and entertains you. 'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' does not thrill, or tell a story worth remembering.I wished the film knew where it was going, but from the trailer, I could tell the kind of film it would be.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

This one is so bad a sequel that it feels like a cheap rip-off of the name. I can't believe the screenwriter is the same guy!Brolin and del Toro are great, but they can't make it up to the awful plot and lines of their characters.If it were a stand-alone action, it would have been just another dumb Hollywood action flick. Bearing the name of the first movie, and the expectation of a sequel, puts it next to it and the comparison is inevitable. It is unfair to compare the two movies, though.I'd say, if you appreciated the first movie, don't ruin your day by watching this one, expecting something alike. They are in completely different categories.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
601,jean_bob_99,Trying to get the stereotypes out there much?,1,23 September 2018,"I've never written a review before, but I really feel like leaving my say here for this short-sighted, obviously indoctrinating movie.It centers around a war between the USA and the Mexican drug cartels, which I think is a fairly milked-out subject, but okay, cool, we all like a surprise, so surprise us. But the surprise is rather uncalled for and unpleasant. In the first 10 minutes our 'protagonist' gets introduced just by scrutinizing some minorities on screen. So rather than having a strong start of the first act, the director chooses to get out there and point fingers at the Islam, the Somali and the Yemeni people. I mean.. come on? Then the next part is about some Mexican teenager, who leaves his perfectly white buddies to step on a middle school bus, while himself stepping in the car of his pot smoking, day drinking, drug dealing friend, who gives him money to commit a crime. Dude!! We haven't seen 15 minutes of footage, nor have we gotten anywhere in the movie's plot and we have seen four minorities ridiculed. There's other ways to make money than feeding people with the same old negative populism. Say, making Sicario.Just to be clear, I'm no full blown peace-to-everyone kinda guy and I get frustrated with other cultures and minorities living around me, but I do know that we did not need another movie to portray 'everyone but the perfect American citizen' as a terrorist. We just do not need this. Remove this movie from existence please.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

604,jengkane-579-52956,Bleaker Than The First,7,23 July 2018,"In the original SICARIO, FBI agents Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) were part of a Critical Response Unit that raided an Arizona safehouse owned by a Mexican drug cartel. Inside they found numerous decaying corpses. This led Macer on an investigation that involved a trip to Juarez, Mexico and ended with a lethal operation in a tunnel that crossed the U.S./Mexico border. These activities were authorised by her boss, CIA Agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and involved an operative called Guillermo Diaz (Benicio del Toro). Eventually, after many fatalities, Macer was left morally depleted by everything she had seen. In the end, she couldn't tell if she was actually on the side of good, fighting the Sonora Cartel, or if the corruption and violence of the US Government meant it was merely a larger, better-armed criminal force.In the sequel, SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO (AKA Sicario 2: Soldado), Macer has moved on and Matt Graver and Guillermo Diaz are tasked by the government to stop the cartels from transporting terrorists into the United States. The smuggling of people can be more lucrative than drugs, it seems. Graver decides to create a war between the Mexican drug cartels. This requires a number of false-flag murders and the kidnapping of Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner), the school-age daughter of a drug lord. This operation, as with the first story, is in a legal grey area. Graver and Diaz are under orders from the Department of Defense, but when things don't go according to plan, they are caught between the needs of the Mexican and US governments and the deadly threat of the cartels. Fingers are pointed. Fall guys are sought.SICARIO was a violently watchable drama where we followed Emily Blunt's FBI character as she wised-up, and fundamentally changed, after she understood the big picture. The brutality and amoral actions of Guillermo Diaz was part of this transformation. In SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO, Diaz is the character whose journey we are most involved with, although Isabela Reyes' struggle as she learns more about the consequences of her drug lord father's activities, also captures our attention. We see how the people-smuggling works through the eyes of young Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez) and this reveals yet another strand of the tale. Miguel is an American citizen who lives on the border in Texas and a cousin chooses him to get involved in this criminal life.Writer Taylor Sheridan has journeyed deeper into the world of the first film, and has attempted to add ISIS and Somali piracy to the mix, to no great effect. When the violence goes down on the borderlands, the film is strongest. Once again, no one is untouched by crime and the spiritual decay that accompanies it.If you just want to watch it as a full-on action movie, SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO is absolutely that, however it is the war with the cartels and the cascading damage it creates that is the most compelling part of this tale. There is something desperate and soulless about what is happening in this world and this effectively underwrites the danger and the violence. Isabel Moner and Benicio del Toro have the most to do and their performances stand out accordingly. Director Stefano Sollima takes the reins on this second outing and although this isn't as powerful as the first, it still delivers a thrilling, nail-biting two hours at the cinema.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Really bad. Could not believe its the same screenwriter. The story is really thin (and short). The overacting by Isabela Moner was too much on many moments. May not be her fault, but the director. Benico and Josh did an excellent job, but the movie is just bad. Most annoying is the rating her. The first 21 (!!) gave it a 10/10. The Godfather Part II came to seven (7). So something is really wrong. Really annoying because I really trust IMDB.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

608,mflinkenberg,A few beers later...,8,15 December 2018,Not sure what's going on with the ratings. People seem to rate or hate this movie. Having come off movie blockbusters like Black Panther I couldn't even sit through to the end I found this a solid film. A little hokey in the set-up but I think there's plenty of life in the franchise and its better than most of the rubbish Hollywood's been putting out lately. BIG SPOILER - I was gutted when BdT was killed and I thought it made the film very real. Relieved when he lived but it was a bit cheap. It's also a bit difficult to believe US soldiers have carte blanche in any territory they chose to venture without consequences and a lot of the actions of the US team in the film just seemed like plain old murder.,Sicario - Day of the Soldado

612,lukeisyourmovieman,Unnecessary and lacks the talent the first one had,5,4 July 2018,"I loved Sicario. Sicario is probably the perfect example of a film with a relatively straightforward story that is executed almost flawlessly by the people in front of and behind the camera. Denis Villneuve is one of the best directors working today and he absolutely killed it. Roger Deakins was incredible as always and the late Johann Johannsson created a suspenseful and original score. When I finished Sicario for the first time, the thought of a sequel didn't once cross my mind. It felt like it was a great movie on its own and didn't need another movie to tell more. The whole point of the first one is Emily Blunt's character. The audience relates to her and she is used as a guide point for how the audience feels.Sicario: Day of the Soldado is unnecessary. It takes the two supporting characters from the first movie and puts them in the main character spot. We know barely anything about these characters from the first movie and we learn nothing new about them this movie. I think the producers of the first Sicario thought that what made that movie great was the suspenseful action moments. That's pretty much the majority of what this movie is. Action sequences sprinkled with suspense. But it doesn't even come close to crafting the same level of suspense because the talent behind the camera is severely missing. I give it a 5/10. The best this movie has to offer is decent performances from Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro. I am not looking foward to third installment in this useless trilogy.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
613,lonelyboy-428-372756,A good movie ruined by someone who didn't do his homework,7,26 November 2018,"The movie starts off by a very ridiliculous assumption that Muslims (who appear to speak fluent Arabic dialect) sneak into the United States from the Mexican borders, while in the real world there are no Arabs in that region to begin with. It lazily suggests that Muslims (again) are a bunch of terrorists who don't give a flying EFF about mothers and kids before blowing themselves into ashes lol.
The movie then proceeds in addressing the issue of Mexican smugglers who illegally transport people from Mexico and into the states. The Action element in it is satisfying, and is actually worth the watch, I personally give it a 7 overall.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

The story feels very real and throughout i felt like i easily could've believed this was a true story if they said so. There were also some unexpected plot twists that i really liked and didn't expect but were awesome. The directing just added to the realism and in putting you in certain situations for ex. by focusing on the right stuff instead of showing off with expensive CGI sequences (but CGI is used really well at the right places, actually i'm not sure if it actually was CGI). The acting was superb as well, of course. Overall i loved this movie especially for it's original story and great directing.

The first was a dark but thoughtful film and I was totally ready to love this one. But, frankly, it sucks because it is sooooo cookie cutter. 
The title makes you think this is going to focus on the Sicario as hero in some way but it just devolves into the same plot as 50 other B films. 
I am surprised critics gave it a pass (barely) but more surprised so many fans say they like it. The man two seats down from me turned as it ended and said, ""What was that?"" in a highly sarcastic tone. 
At the end anyone can realize you just wasted two hours to be shown there would be a third, probably worse film. 
Total waste of Benicio del Torres and of Brolin. Absolutely rote acting because there is nothing for them to bite into. del Torres' second Sicario is a shell of the first and there is nothing to truly show WHY he has softened.

628,gokhan-g-88,Unnecessary involvement of religious theme,1,2 February 2019,"Beginning scenes including ""muslims"" with the bombing attacks were very unnecessary. These scenes do not really help with the plot, besides being able to mention a connection between the mexican citizens' actions and terrorism. Actually the persons at the beginning are never referred to as muslims, but by saying ""allahu akbar"" this is being implied and showing some prayer carpets the association to the islamic religion is obvious. This kind of portrayal is appealing in a very negative and more important false way to the islamic religion by building up a connection between terrorists and muslims.
In movie productions this issue has to be dealt with more carefully. Although it has been seen thousands of times before in several movies whenever religiously motivated enemies occur in a movie they either are ""muslims"" or people with an islamic background.

The cinematography and filming is great, it could really be a masterpiece. but instead, the story is there to prepare us for the next film, where (spoiler alert) Benicio Del Toro will train a 20 year old young man to become a sicario. the storyline is for ten year olds and the dramatic tensions are so irrational, you just cannot follow the plot. two examples: (spoilers ahead): Benicio Del Toro survives a gunshot to the head in the middle of the desert, only to heal in a few months and decide to train his would-be-killer how to become a sicario himself! unbelievable, really...

We follow Benicio del Toro's and Josh brolin's characters into an amazing strategic plan and they have created to get back to the Mexican cartels but as these movies usually go they get a bumpy ride.
I mean what can I say about Benicio del Toro's performance in this movie, it's amazing what he has accomplished in his acting career and once again he shows how good of an actor he is. His performance in this film is growing and very investing as he shows us how character that previously lost all kind of human morality can regain it under the right circumstances. Josh Brolin is also amazing in this movie, he portrays his classic tough guy persona and I have no problem with it since he does it so well, the chemistry between and Benicio del Toro's is a very good one as they show they even though your heart is Stone certain scenarios can break their tendencies.

But this sequel had no story and no suspense. It took me too long to realize that the plot was about using as a pawn, then saving a cartel kingpin's daughter, pinning DelToro against Brolin? They set that in motion to get the cartels to go to war, but then there is no follow up on her plan. Suddenly, the plot changes to a savior mission. And the strong, ruthless, DelToro can't even figure out how to get her across the border!? He puts his life in jealordy with his inept efforts to save her? So much for his character development and cunning, ruthless skills and abilities. And the big rivalry or confrontation between the two primary actors happens - via a somewhat boring phone call!?

665,jrb-52611,Not better than the first but a good sequel overall.,7,4 July 2018,"Before viewing this movie I was skeptical. A new director had taken charge and I was worried it might not have the same feel as it's predecessor. Though,I can say that it might not be better than Denis Villeneuve's 2015 Sicario,it is a great follow up. I did feel tension from beginning,middle,and end as we follow Benicio del Toro's character Alejandro. Both Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin give an amazing performance,as well as many others. Including young actress Isabela Moner who makes you feel for her character as she witnesses the brutality of men in war. I did feel that there were some pacing issues and a little bit of sequel bating. There is a point in the plot that both Brolin and del Toro's characters are trying to track down a man know as Carlos Reyes. Carlos is the leader of a Mexican cartel who had been transporting terrorists through the Mexican border. Also the father of Moner's character. The problem with how they handled the character is that he is no where in the film. There is a brief moment where he is seen disguised as a police officer from a U.S drone, but we cannot see his face. This cartel leader had been mentioned throughout the film but he doesn't really play an integral part to the story. So I'm assuming that the film is building him up for the third movie. I was hoping that Carlos Reyes would play a greater role with Moner's character but sadly he is kept in the dark. Overall,I enjoyed the movie not as better film than the first but as a very satisfying sequel.",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) as ruthless sicario turned against the drug carlets operating along the US-Mexico border, the sequal lacks this tension and becomes an analogue and rather predictable story. Decent acting performances, and attempts to recreate the original dark athmosphere cannot save the weak plot, where several interesting issues launched at the start are not followed through.

The main reason I felt that is because there are many logical failure in the movie. The biggest failure is the last 5 min. Benicio Del Toro got a shot on his FACE. He is still able to walk a couple of hours in desert and flight and drive a car. If I remember clearly I am not watching ""First blood"" and this is not a super hero movie. There are other small logical failures. For example, Benicio Del Toro is so cold that could kill children the first movie, but this time he said ""I can't do it"". In this movie the desert looks so small. And so easy to cross, a girl could easily walked for hours in desert. I have no idea how she did. So try to consider it as a regular gunfight crime movie.

When we watched Sicario 2015, I had 0 expectations about the movie, as my wife only told me briefly about what the story is about. 10 minutes into the movie, I told her the first time, that this is like the best movie ever. At the end of the movie, I think I had told her that phrase nearly 20 times. It is absolutely one of my favourite movies and hearing that there will be Sicario 2 , I was breathless and couldn't wait to watch it. Yesterday it finally aired and I couldn't sit still for a second. I loved how the story develops in Sicario 2 and that they didn't decide to just make a new version of the first movie. No, they developed a new story into it and learning more about Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick character gave me goose bumps. As said, my wife is Mexican, so she could follow all the Spanish dialogues. She said with some of the actors, she noticed that they are no Mexican natives but Benicio del Toro's acting and speaking is simply excellent. I can just encourage anybody who is reading this, to go and watch that movie, it is worth your money. I didn't want it to end and after the last scene, I just had one question: Will there be a third movie? I can only hope so...",Sicario - Day of the Soldado

689,Niceguydave84,Brilliant,9,28 September 2018,"Brilliant sequel to the first movie which was a masterpiece as well. I've been looking forward to this film for quite some time since the first Sicario was such a unique and riveting film with amazingly realistic action and tactical scenes. Sicario 2 doesn't disappoint with an array of plot twists, incredible action scenes that the film makes you wait patiently for. There are certain hints within the film that lead the viewer to believe that Brolin's character may have been responsible for the death of Alejandro's family, but that wasn't definitively clear. I think that there could be an entire movie about the origins of Alejandro showing the development of his character to becoming a or ""the"" sicario. The end of the film was extremely well done with a year passing and Alejandro confronting the boy that almost killed him. The viewer is left with many speculatory guesses as to what will happen next. Will Alejandro execute revenge on Brolin and his team? Will the young boy become a Sicario, or Alejandro's apprentice? Will Alejandro take revenge on the boy? This is a movie that makes you think about it even weeks after. All in all, this film has spectacular acting, riveting edge of seat scenes, and a tense musical score that adds to the experience.

They kidnap this girl, drive her back and forth across the border a few times, shoot a few corrupt policemen in the process and apparently *that* of all things is enough to stop the operation. Mexican dude grows a heart, but in a sudden twist that seems so completely unlikely that it can't be taken seriously, there's yet another gunfight. But luckily the main characters have plot armor and nothing actually happens, so we're set up for a sequel.The story is garbage. At least the first Sicario was somewhat interesting in that respect.

There was no logical explanation for it, and none was provided by the character. That whole plot line disappears after a short while.

Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin once again provided fantastic performances, but this was inspire of a script that just somehow didn't feel right to me. The storyline starts strong but has no real payoff or climax the way the first movie did with the death of Silvio building up to the vengeance killing of Fausto Alarcon played brilliantly, though briefly, by Julio Cesar Cedillo. The middle of this sequel just feels slow, with the last third feeling rushed to get to the point. Ultimately for me, it felt more like the point was to set-up a third movie. I also preferred the much more indie feeling of the original Sicario over this higher budget sequel. Though I do award major points for sticking to realistic practical effects, and no stereotypical Hollywood ""endless ammunition"" weaponry. All in all I just think that it was 50/50. Maybe it would have been better with less money to make it. Either way, if there is a third, I hope they go back to the feel and satisfaction of the original movie",Sicario - Day of the Soldado
